In addition to these\nrequirements, owners or operators of lead recovery furnaces that are subject to\nregulation under the Secondary Lead Smelting NESHAP must comply with the\nrequirements of paragraph (8) of this subdivision. (a) Provide a one-time written notice to the\ncommissioner indicating the following: (1)\nthe owner or operator claims exemption under this paragraph; (2)\nthe hazardous waste is burned solely for\nmetal recovery consistent with the provisions of subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph; (3)\nthe hazardous waste\ncontains recoverable levels of metals; and\n(4)\nthe owner or operator will comply with\nthe sampling and analysis and recordkeeping requirements of this\nsubparagraph; (b) sample\nand analyze the hazardous waste and other feedstocks as necessary to comply\nwith the requirements of this paragraph by using appropriate analytical methods\nthat are ELAP certified analytical methods. If ELAP certified methods are not\navailable, analysis should be performed using EPA standard methods. If neither\nof those are available, the department will evaluate and approve proposals to\nuse other methods to ensure that resulting data will meet data quality\nobjectives; and\n(c) maintain at the\nfacility for at least three years records to document compliance with the\nprovisions of this paragraph including limits on levels of toxic organic\nconstituents and Btu value of the waste, and levels of recoverable metals in\nthe hazardous waste compared to normal nonhazardous waste feedstocks. (ii)\nA hazardous waste\nmeeting either of the following criteria is not processed solely for metal\nrecovery: (a) the hazardous waste has a total\nconcentration of organic compounds listed in Appendix 23 of this Title (see\n\nPart 371) exceeding 500 ppm by weight, as-fired, and so is considered to be\nburned for destruction. The concentration of organic compounds in a waste\nas-generated may be reduced to the 500 ppm limit by bona fide treatment that\nremoves or destroys organic constituents. Blending for dilution to meet the 500\nppm limit is prohibited. Documentation that the waste has not been\nimpermissibly diluted must be retained in the records required by clause\n(i)(\nc\n) of this paragraph; or\n(b) the hazardous waste has a heating value\nof 5,000 Btu/lb or more, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned as fuel. The heating value of a waste as-generated may be reduced to below the 5,000\n\nBtu/lb limit by bona fide treatment that removes or destroys organic\nconstituents. Blending for dilution to meet the 5,000 Btu/lb limit is\nprohibited. Documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly diluted\nmust be retained in the records required by clause (i)(\nc\n) of\nthis paragraph. (iii)\n\nTo\nbe exempt from subdivisions (c) through (l), an owner or operator of a lead or\nnickel-chromium or mercury recovery furnace (except for owners or operators of\nlead recovery furnaces subject to regulation under the Secondary Lead Smelting\nNESHAP) or a metal recovery furnace that burns baghouse bags used to capture\nmetallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing, must provide a one-time written\nnotice to the commissioner identifying each hazardous waste burned and\nspecifying whether the owner or operator claims an exemption for each waste\nunder this subparagraph or subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. The owner or\noperator must comply with the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph for those wastes claimed to be exempt under that subparagraph and\nmust comply with the requirements below for those wastes claimed to be exempt\nunder this subparagraph. (a) the hazardous\nwastes listed in Appendices 51, 52 and 53 of this Title and baghouse bags used\nto capture metallic dusts emitted by steel manufacturing are exempt from the\nrequirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, provided that: (1)\na waste listed in Appendix 51 of this\n\nTitle must contain recoverable levels of lead. A waste listed in Appendix 52 of\nthis Title must contain recoverable levels of nickel or chromium, a waste\nlisted in Appendix 53 of this Title must contain recoverable levels of mercury\nand contain less than 500 parts per million of Appendix 23 organic\nconstituents, and baghouse bags used to capture metallic dusts emitted by steel\nmanufacturing must contain recoverable levels of metal; and\n(2)\nthe waste does not exhibit the toxicity\ncharacteristic of section\n371.3\n(e) of this\n\nTitle for an organic constituent; and\n(3)\nthe waste is not a hazardous waste listed\nin section\n371.4\nof this Title because it is\nlisted for an organic constituent, as identified in Appendix 22 of this Title\n(see Part 371 of this Title); and\n(4)\nthe owner or operator certifies in the\none-time notice that hazardous waste is burned under the provisions of this\nsubparagraph and that sampling and analysis will be conducted or other\ninformation will be obtained as necessary to ensure continued compliance with\nthese requirements. Sampling and analysis shall be conducted according to\nclause (i)(\nb\n) of this paragraph. Records to document\ncompliance with this subparagraph shall be kept for at least three\nyears; (b) the\ncommissioner may decide, on a case-by-case basis, that the toxic organic\nconstituents in a material listed in Appendix 51, 52 or 53 of this Title that\ncontains a total concentration of more than 500 ppm toxic organic compounds, listed in Appendix 23 of this Title (see Part 371 of this Title), may pose a\nhazard to human health and the environment when burned in a metal recovery\nfurnace exempt from the requirements of this section. In that situation, after\nadequate notice and opportunity for comment, the metal recovery furnace will\nbecome subject to the requirements of this section when burning that material. In making the hazard determination, the commissioner will consider the\nfollowing factors: (1)\nthe concentration and\ntoxicity of organic constituents in the material; and\n(2)\nthe level of destruction of toxic organic\nconstituents provided by the furnace; and\n(3)\nwhether the acceptable ambient levels\nestablished in Appendix 44 or 45 of this Title may be exceeded for any toxic\norganic compound that may be emitted, based on dispersion modeling to predict\nthe maximum annual average off-site ground level concentration. (5)\n\nThe standards for direct transfer\noperations under subdivision (l) of this section, apply only to facilities\nsubject to the permit standards of subdivision (c) of this section, or the\ninterim status standards of subdivision (d) of this section.

(i) The owner or operator must provide an\nanalysis of the hazardous waste that quantifies the concentration of any\nconstituent identified in Appendix 23 of this Title (see Part 371 of this\n\nTitle) that may reasonably be expected to be in the waste. Such constituents\nmust be identified and quantified, if present, at levels detectable by using\nappropriate analytical methods that are ELAP certified analytical methods. If\nELAP certified methods are not available, analysis should be performed using\nEPA standard methods. If neither of those are available, the department will\nevaluate and approve proposals to use other methods to ensure that resulting\ndata will meet data quality objectives. The Appendix 23 of this Title\nconstituents excluded from this analysis must be identified and the basis for\ntheir exclusion explained. This analysis will be used to provide all\ninformation required by this section and sections\n373-1.5\n(i) and\n373-1.9\n(d) of this\n\nTitle and to enable the permit writer to prescribe such permit conditions as\nnecessary to protect human health and the environment. Such analysis must be\nincluded as a portion of the Part 373 permit application, or, for facilities\noperating under the interim status standards of this section, as a portion of\nthe trial burn plan that may be submitted before the Part 373 permit\napplication under provisions of section\n373-1.9\n(d)(7)\nof\nthis Title, as well as any other analysis required by the permit authority in\npreparing the permit. Owners and operators of boilers and industrial furnaces\nnot operating under the interim status standards must provide the information\nrequired by section\n373-1.5\n(i) or\n373-1.9\n(d)(3)\nof\nthis Title in the Part 373 permit application to the greatest extent\npossible. (ii)\n\nThroughout normal\noperation, the owner or operator must conduct sampling and analysis, as\nnecessary, to ensure that the hazardous waste, other fuels, and industrial\nfurnace feedstocks fired into the boiler or industrial furnace are within the\nphysical and chemical composition limits specified in the permit. (3)\n\nEmissions standards. Owners\nand operators must comply with emissions standards provided by subdivisions (e)\nthrough (h) of this section. (4)\n\nPermits. (i) The owner or operator may burn\nonly hazardous wastes specified in the facility permit and only under the\noperating conditions specified under paragraph (5) of this subdivision, except\nin approved trial burns under the conditions specified in section\n373-1.9\n(d) of this\n\nTitle. (ii)\n\nHazardous wastes not\nspecified in the permit may not be burned until operating conditions have been\nspecified under a new permit or permit modification, as applicable. Operating\nrequirements for new wastes may be based on either trial burn results or\nalternative data included with the Part 373 permit application under section\n373-1.5\n(i) of this\n\nTitle. (iii)\n\nBoilers and industrial\nfurnaces operating under the interim status standards of subdivision (d) of\nthis section are permitted under procedures provided by section\n373-1.9\n(d)(7)\nof\nthis Title. (iv)\nA permit for a new\nboiler or industrial furnace (those boilers and industrial furnaces not\noperating under the interim status standards) must establish appropriate\nconditions for each of the applicable requirements of this subdivision, including, but not limited to, allowable hazardous waste firing rates and\noperating conditions necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (5) of\nthis subdivision, in order to comply with the following standards: (a) For the period beginning with initial\nintroduction of hazardous waste and ending with initiation of the trial burn, and only for the minimum time required to bring the device to a point of\noperational readiness to conduct a trial burn, not to exceed a duration of 720\nhours operating time when burning hazardous waste, the operating requirements\nmust be those most likely to ensure compliance with the emission standards of\nsubdivisions (e) through (h) of this section, based on the commissioner's\nengineering judgment. If the applicant is seeking a waiver from a trial burn to\ndemonstrate conformance with a particular emission standard, the operating\nrequirements during this initial period of operation shall include those\nspecified by the applicable provisions of subdivisions (e) through (h) of this\nsection. The commissioner may extend the duration of this period for up to 720\nadditional hours when the applicant demonstrates good cause for the\nextension.

(vi)\n\nMeasuring parameters and establishing limits based on trial burn data. (a) General requirements. As specified in\nsubparagraphs (ii) through (v) of this paragraph, each operating parameter\nshall be measured, and permit limits on the parameter shall be established\naccording to either of the following procedures: (1)\n\nInstantaneous limits. A parameter may be\nmeasured and recorded on an instantaneous basis (\ni.e., the\nvalue that occurs at any time) and the permit limit specified as the\ntime-weighted average during all valid runs of the trial burn; or\n(2)\n\nHourly rolling average. (i) The limit for a parameter may be\nestablished and continuously monitored on an hourly rolling average basis\ndefined as follows: (A)\nA continuous monitor\nis one which continuously samples the regulated parameter without interruption, and evaluates the detector response at least once each 15 seconds, and computes\nand records the average value at least every 60 seconds. (B)\n\nAn hourly rolling average is the\narithmetic mean of the 60 most recent one-minute average values recorded by the\ncontinuous monitoring system. (ii)\n\nThe permit limit for the parameter shall\nbe established based on trial burn data as the average over all valid test runs\nof the highest hourly rolling average value for each run. (b) Rolling average limits for\ncarcinogenic metals and lead. Feed rate limits for the carcinogenic metals\n(\ni.e., arsenic, beryllium, cadmium and chromium) and lead may\nbe established either on an hourly rolling average basis as prescribed by\nclause\n(a) of this subparagraph or on (up to) a 24-hour\nrolling average basis. If the owner or operator elects to use an average period\nfrom two to 24 hours: (1)\nthe feed rate of\neach metal shall be limited at any time to 10 times the feed rate that would be\nallowed on an hourly rolling average basis; (2)\nthe continuous monitor shall meet the\nfollowing specifications: (i) a continuous\nmonitor is one which continuously samples the regulated parameter without\ninterruption, and evaluates the detector response at least once each 15\nseconds, and computes and records the average value at least every 60\nseconds. (ii)\nthe rolling average\nfor the selected averaging period is defined as the arithmetic mean of one hour\nblock averages for the averaging period. A one hour block average is the\narithmetic mean of the one minute averages recorded during the 60-minute period\nbeginning at one minute after the beginning of the preceding clock hour; and\n(3)\nthe permit limit\nfor the feed rate of each metal shall be established based on trial burn data\nas the average over all valid test runs of the highest hourly rolling average\nfeed rate for each run. (c) Feed rate limits for metals, total\nchloride and chlorine, and ash. Feed rate limits for metals, total chlorine and\nchloride, and ash are established and monitored by knowing the concentration of\nthe substance\n(i.e., metals, chloride/chlorine, and ash) in\neach feedstream and the flow rate of the feedstream. To monitor the feed rate\nof these substances, the flow rate of each feedstream must be monitored under\nthe continuous monitoring requirements of clauses\n(a) and\n(b) of this subparagraph. (d) Conduct of trial burn testing. (1)\n\nIf compliance with all applicable\nemissions standards of subdivisions (e) through (h) of this section is not\ndemonstrated simultaneously during a set of test runs, the operating conditions\nof additional test runs required to demonstrate compliance with remaining\nemissions standards must be as close as possible to the original operating\nconditions. (2)\n\nPrior to obtaining\ntest data for purposes of demonstrating compliance with the emissions standards\nof subdivisions (e) through (h) of this section or establishing limits on\noperating parameters under this Subpart, the facility must operate under trial\nburn conditions for a sufficient period to reach steady-state operations. The\ncommissioner may determine, however, that industrial furnaces that recycle\ncollected particulate matter back into the furnace and that comply with an\nalternative implementation approach for metals under paragraph (g)(6) of this\nsection need not reach steady state conditions with respect to the flow of\nmetals in the system prior to beginning compliance testing for metals\nemissions. (3)\n\nTrial burn data on\nthe level of an operating parameter for which a limit must be established in\nthe permit must be obtained during emissions sampling for the pollutant(s)\n(\ni.e., metals, PM, HCl/Cl\n2, organic\ncompounds) for which the parameter must be established as specified by this\nparagraph. (vii)\n\nGeneral requirements. (a) Fugitive emissions. Fugitive emissions\nmust be controlled by: (1)\nkeeping the\ncombustion zone totally sealed against fugitive emissions; or\n(2)\nmaintaining the combustion zone pressure\nlower than atmospheric pressure; or\n(3)\nan alternate means of control\ndemonstrated (with the Part 373 permit application) to provide fugitive\nemissions control equivalent to maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower\nthan atmospheric pressure. (b) Automatic waste feed cutoff. A boiler or\nindustrial furnace must be operated with a functioning system that\nautomatically cuts off the hazardous waste feed when operating conditions\ndeviate from those established under this subdivision. The commissioner may\nlimit the number of cutoffs per an operating period on a case-by-case basis. In\naddition: (1)\nthe permit limit for (the\nindicator of) minimum combustion chamber temperature must be maintained while\nhazardous waste or hazardous waste residues remain in the combustion\nchamber; (2)\nexhaust gases must be\nducted to the air pollution control system operated in accordance with the\npermit requirements while hazardous waste or hazardous waste residues remain in\nthe combustion chamber; and\n(3)\noperating parameters for which permit limits are established must continue to\nbe monitored during the cutoff, and the hazardous waste feed shall not be\nrestarted until the levels of those parameters comply with the permit limits. For parameters that may be monitored on an instantaneous basis, the\ncommissioner will establish a minimum period of time after a waste feed cutoff\nduring which the parameter must not exceed the permit limit before the\nhazardous waste feed may be restarted. (c) Changes. A boiler or industrial furnace\nmust cease burning hazardous waste when changes in combustion properties, or\nfeed rates of the hazardous waste, other fuels, or industrial furnace\nfeedstocks, or changes in the boiler or industrial furnace design or operating\nconditions deviate from the limits as specified in the permit. (viii)\n\nMonitoring and Inspections. (a) The owner or operator must monitor and\nrecord the following, at a minimum, while burning hazardous waste: (1)\nif specified by the permit, feed rates\nand composition of hazardous waste, other fuels, and industrial furnace\nfeedstocks, and feed rates of ash, metals, and total chloride and\nchlorine; (2)\nif specified by the\npermit, carbon monoxide (CO), hydrocarbons (HC), and oxygen on a continuous\nbasis at a common point in the boiler or industrial furnace downstream of the\ncombustion zone and prior to release of stack gases to the atmosphere in\naccordance with operating requirements specified in clause\n(ii)\n(b) of this paragraph. CO, HC, and oxygen monitors must be\ninstalled, operated, and maintained in accordance with methods specified in\n\nAppendix 49 of this Title; and\n(3)\nupon the request of the commissioner, sampling and analysis of the hazardous\nwaste (and other fuels and industrial furnace feedstocks as appropriate), residues, and exhaust emissions must be conducted to verify that the operating\nrequirements established in the permit achieve the applicable standards of\nsubdivisions (e) through (h) of this section. (b) All monitors shall record data in units\ncorresponding to the permit limit unless otherwise specified in the\npermit. (c) The boiler or\nindustrial furnace and associated equipment (pumps, valves, pipes, fuel storage\ntanks, etc.) must be subjected to thorough visual inspection when it contains\nhazardous waste, at least daily for leaks, spills, fugitive emissions, and\nsigns of tampering. (d) The\nautomatic hazardous waste feed cutoff system and associated alarms must be\ntested at least once every seven days when hazardous waste is burned to verify\noperability, unless the applicant demonstrates to the commissioner that weekly\ninspections will unduly restrict or upset operations, and that less frequent\ninspections will be adequate. At a minimum, operational testing must be\nconducted at least once every 30 days. (e) These monitoring and inspection data must\nbe recorded and the records must be placed in the operating record required by\nsection\n373-2.5\n(c) of this\n\nTitle. (ix)\n\nDirect\ntransfer to the burner. If hazardous waste is directly transferred from a\ntransport vehicle to a boiler or industrial furnace without the use of a\nstorage unit, the owner and operator must comply with subdivision (l) of this\nsection. (x) Recordkeeping. The\nowner or operator must keep in the operating record of the facility all\ninformation and data required by this subdivision until closure of the\nfacility. (xi)\n\nClosure. At closure, the owner or operator must remove all hazardous waste and hazardous waste\nresidues (including, but not limited to, ash, scrubber waters, and scrubber\nsludges) from the boiler or industrial furnace. (d) Interim status standards for\nburners. (1)\n\nPurpose, scope, applicability. (i) General. (a) The purpose of this subdivision is to\nestablish minimum national standards for owners and operators of existing\nboilers and industrial furnaces that burn hazardous waste where such standards\ndefine the acceptable management of hazardous waste during the period of\ninterim status. The standards of this subdivision apply to owners and operators\nof existing facilities until either a Part 373 permit is issued, which includes\nthe standards and requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this section, or until\nclosure responsibilities identified in this subdivision are\nfulfilled. (b) Existing or\nin existence\nmeans a boiler or industrial furnace that, on or before\n\nAugust 21, 1991, is either in operation burning or processing hazardous waste, or for which construction (including the ancillary facilities to burn or to\nprocess the hazardous waste) has commenced. A facility has commenced\nconstruction if the owner or operator has obtained the Federal, State, and\nlocal approvals or permits necessary to begin physical construction; and\neither: (1)\na continuous on-site, physical\nconstruction program has begun; or\n(2)\nthe owner or operator has entered into\ncontractual obligations (which cannot be canceled or modified without\nsubstantial loss) for physical construction of the facility to be completed\nwithin a reasonable time. (c) If a boiler or industrial furnace is\nlocated at a facility that already has a permit or interim status, then the\nfacility must comply with the applicable regulations dealing with permit\nmodifications in section\n373-1.7\nof this Title or changes in\ninterim status in section\n373-1.3\n(g) of this\n\nTitle. (ii)\n\nExemptions. The requirements of this subdivision do not apply to hazardous waste and\nfacilities exempt under paragraph (a)(2), or subdivision (i) of this\nsection. (iii)\n\nProhibition on\nburning dioxin-listed wastes. The following hazardous wastes listed for dioxin\nand hazardous waste derived from any of these wastes may not be burned in a\nboiler or industrial furnace operating under interim status: F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, and F027. (iv)\n\nApplicability of Subpart 373-3 of this Title standards. Owners and operators of\nboilers and industrial furnaces that burn hazardous waste and are operating\nunder interim status are subject to the following provisions of Subpart 373-3\nof this Title, except as provided otherwise by this subdivision: (a) in section\n373-3.1\n(General), subdivision (b); (b) in section\n373-3.2\n(General facility\nstandards), subdivisions (b) through (h); (c) in section\n373-3.3\n(Preparedness and\nprevention), subdivisions (b) through (g); (d) in section\n373-3.4\n(Contingency plan and\nemergency procedures), subdivisions (b) through (g); (e) in section\n373-3.5\n(Manifest system, recordkeeping, and reporting), subdivisions (b) through (g), except that\nsubdivisions (b) and (f) do not apply to owners and operators of on-site\nfacilities that do not receive any hazardous waste from off-site\nsources; (f) in section\n373-3.7\n(Closure and post-closure), subdivisions (b) through (f); (g) in section\n373-3.8\n(Financial requirements), subdivisions (b), (c), (d), (h) and (i), except that the State and the Federal\ngovernment are exempt from the requirements of section\n373-3.8; and\n(h) section\n373-3.28\n(Air emission standards\nfor equipment leaks), except paragraph (a)(1). (v) Special requirements for furnaces. The\nfollowing controls apply during interim status to industrial furnaces\n(\ne.g., kilns, cupolas) that feed hazardous waste for a purpose\nother than solely as an ingredient (see clause\n[b]\nof this\nsubparagraph) at any location other than the hot end where products are\nnormally discharged or where fuels are normally fired: (a) Controls. (1)\nthe hazardous waste shall be fed at a\nlocation where combustion gas temperatures area at least 1800 degrees\nF; (2)\nthe owner or operator must\ndetermine that adequate oxygen is present in combustion gases to combust\norganic constituents in the waste and retain documentation of such\ndetermination in the facility record; (3)\nfor cement kiln systems, the hazardous\nwaste shall be fed into the kiln; and\n(4)\nthe hydrocarbon controls of paragraph\n(e)(3) of this section or subparagraph (3)(v) of this subdivision apply upon\ncertification of compliance under paragraph (3) of this subdivision\nirrespective of the CO level achieved during the compliance test. (b) Burning hazardous waste solely\nas an ingredient. A hazardous waste is burned for a purpose other than solely\nas an ingredient if it meets either of these criteria: (1)\nthe hazardous waste has a total\nconcentration of nonmetal compounds listed in Appendix 23 of this Title (see\n\nPart 371) exceeding 500 ppm by weight, as-fired, and so is considered to be\nburned for destruction. The concentration of nonmetal compounds in a waste\nas-generated may be reduced to the 500 ppm limit by bona fide treatment that\nremoves or destroys nonmetal constituents. Blending for dilution to meet the\n500 ppm limit is prohibited. Documentation that the waste has not been\nimpermissibly diluted must be retained in the facility record; or\n(2)\nthe hazardous waste has a heating value\nof 5,000 Btu/lb or more, as-fired, and so is considered to be burned as fuel. The heating value of a waste as-generated may be reduced to below the 5,000\n\nBtu/lb limit by bona fide treatment that removes or destroys organic\nconstituents. Blending to augment the heating value to meet the 5,000 Btu/lb\nlimit is prohibited. Documentation that the waste has not been impermissibly\nblended must be retained in the facility record. (vi)\n\nRestrictions on burning\nhazardous waste that is not a fuel. Prior to certification of compliance under\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision, owners and operators shall not feed, to a\nboiler or industrial furnace, hazardous waste that has a heating value less\nthan 5,000 Btu/lb, as-generated, (except that the heating value of a waste\nas-generated may be increased above the 5,000 Btu/lb limit by bona fide\ntreatment; however, blending to augment the heating value to meet the 5,000\n\nBtu/lb limit is prohibited. Records must be kept to document that impermissible\nblending has not occurred), except that: (a) hazardous waste may be burned solely as an ingredient; or\n(b) hazardous waste may be burned for\npurposes of compliance testing (or testing prior to compliance testing) for a\ntotal period of time not to exceed 720 hours; or\n(c) such waste may be burned if the\ncommissioner has documentation to show that, prior to August 21, 1991: (1)\nthe boiler or industrial furnace is\noperating under the interim status standards for incinerators provided by\nsection\n373-3.15\nof this Title, or the\ninterim status standards for thermal treatment units provided by section\n373-3.16\nthis Title; and\n(2)\nthe boiler or industrial furnace met the\ninterim status eligibility requirements under subdivision\n373-1.3\n(c) of this\n\nTitle for sections\n373-3.15\nor\n373-3.16\nof this Title; and\n(3)\nhazardous waste with a\nheating value less than 5,000 Btu/lb was burned prior to that date; or\n(d) such waste may be\nburned in a halogen acid furnace if the waste was burned as an excluded\ningredient under section\n371.1\n(c)(6)\nof\nthis Title prior to February 21, 1991 and documentation is kept on file\nsupporting this claim. (vii)\n\nDirect transfer to the burner. If\nhazardous waste is directly transferred from a transport vehicle to a boiler or\nindustrial furnace without the use of a storage unit, the owner and operator\nmust comply with subdivision (l) of this section. (2)\n\nCertification of precompliance. (i) General. The owner or operator must have\nprovided complete and accurate information, specified in subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph, to the EPA administrator on or before August 21, 1991, and must\nhave established limits for the operating parameters specified in subparagraph\n(iii) of this paragraph. Such information is termed a certification of\nprecompliance and constitutes a certification that the owner or operator has\ndetermined that, when the facility is operated within the limits specified in\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, the owner or operator believes that, using best engineering judgment, emissions of particulate matter, metals, and\nHCl and Cl\n2\nare not likely to exceed the limits\nprovided by subdivisions (f) through (h) of this section. The facility may burn\nhazardous waste only under the operating conditions that the owner or operator\nestablishes under subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph until the owner or\noperator submits a revised certification of precompliance under subparagraph\n(viii) of this paragraph or a certification of compliance under paragraph (3)\nof this subdivision, or until a permit is issued. (ii)\n\nInformation required. The following\ninformation must be submitted with the certification of precompliance to\nsupport the determination that the limits established for the operating\nparameters identified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph are not likely to\nresult in an exceedance of the allowable emission rates for particulate matter, metals, and HCl and Cl\n2: (a) General facility information: (1)\nEPA facility ID number; (2)\nfacility name, contact person, telephone\nnumber, and address; (3)\ndescription of boilers and industrial furnaces burning hazardous waste, including type and capacity of device; (4)\na scaled plot plan showing the entire\nfacility and location of the boilers and industrial furnaces burning hazardous\nwaste; and\n(5)\na description of the\nair pollution control system on each device burning hazardous waste, including\nthe temperature of the flue gas at the inlet to the particulate matter control\nsystem.

(ii)\n\nPrior notice of compliance testing. At least 30 days prior to the compliance\ntesting required by subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, the owner or operator\nshall notify the commissioner and submit the following information: (a) general facility information including: (1)\nEPA facility ID number; (2)\nfacility name, contact person, telephone\nnumber, and address; (3)\nperson\nresponsible for conducting compliance test, including company name, address, and telephone number, and a statement of qualifications; (4)\nplanned date of the compliance\ntest; (b) specific\ninformation on each device to be tested including: (1)\ndescription of boiler or industrial\nfurnace; (2)\na scaled plot plan\nshowing the entire facility and location of the boiler or industrial\nfurnace; (3)\na description of the\nair pollution control system; (4)\nidentification of the continuous emission monitors that are installed, including: (i) carbon monoxide\nmonitor; (ii)\noxygen\nmonitor; (iii)\nhydrocarbon monitor, specifying the minimum temperature of the system and, if the temperature is\nless than 150° C, an explanation of why a heated system is not used (see\nsubparagraph [v] of this paragraph) and a brief description of the sample gas\nconditioning system; (5)\nindication of whether the stack is shared with another device that will be in\noperation during the compliance test; (6)\nother information useful to an\nunderstanding of the system design or operation; (c) information on the testing planned, including a complete copy of the test protocol and quality assurance/quality\ncontrol (QA/QC) plan, and a summary description for each test providing the\nfollowing information, at a minimum: (1)\npurpose of the test (\ne.g., demonstrate compliance with\nemissions of particulate matter); and\n(2)\nplanned operating conditions, including\nlevels for each pertinent parameter specified in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. (iii)\n\nCompliance testing. (a) General. Compliance testing must be\nconducted under conditions for which the owner or operator has submitted a\ncertification of precompliance under paragraph (2) of this subdivision and\nunder conditions established in the notification of compliance testing required\nby subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. The owner or operator may seek approval\non a case-by-case basis to use compliance test data from one unit in lieu of\ntesting a similar onsite unit. To support the request, the owner or operator\nmust provide a comparison of the hazardous waste burned and other feedstreams, and the design, operation, and maintenance of both the tested unit and the\nsimilar unit. The commissioner shall provide a written approval to use\ncompliance test data in lieu of testing a similar unit if the commissioner\nfinds that the hazardous wastes, the devices, and the operating conditions are\nsufficiently similar, and the data from the other compliance test is adequate\nto meet the requirements of this paragraph. (b) Special requirements for industrial\nfurnaces that recycle collected PM. Owners and operators of industrial furnaces\nthat recycle back into the furnace particulate matter (PM) from the air\npollution control system must comply with one of the following procedures for\ntesting to determine compliance with the metals standards of paragraphs (g)(3)\nor (4) of this section: (1)\nthe special\ntesting requirements prescribed in \"Alternative Method for Implementing Metals\n\nControls\" in Appendix 49 of this Title; or\n(2)\nstack emissions testing for a minimum of\nsix hours each day while hazardous waste is burned during interim status. The\ntesting must be conducted when burning normal hazardous waste for that day at\nnormal feed rates for that day and when the air pollution control system is\noperated under normal conditions. During interim status, hazardous waste\nanalysis for metals content must be sufficient for the owner or operator to\ndetermine if changes in metals content may affect the ability of the facility\nto meet the metals emissions standards established under paragraphs (g)(3) or\n(4) of this section. Under this option, operating limits (under subparagraph\n[i] of this paragraph) must be established during compliance testing under this\nsubparagraph only on the following parameters: (i) feed rate of total hazardous\nwaste; (ii)\ntotal feed rate of\nchlorine and chloride in total feed streams; (iii)\ntotal feed rate of ash in total field\nstreams, except that the ash feed rate for cement kilns and lightweight\naggregate kilns is not limited. (iv)\ncarbon monoxide concentration, and where\nrequired, hydrocarbon concentration in stack gas; (v) maximum production rate of the device in\nappropriate units when producing normal product; or\n(3)\nconduct compliance testing to determine\ncompliance with the metals standards to establish limits on the operating\nparameters of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph only after the kiln system has\nbeen conditioned to enable it to reach equilibrium with respect to metals fed\ninto the system and metals emissions. During conditioning, hazardous waste and\nraw materials having the same metals content as will be fed during the\ncompliance test must be fed at the feed rates that will be fed during the\ncompliance test. (c) Conduct of compliance testing. (1)\n\nIf\ncompliance with all applicable emissions standards of subdivisions (e) through\n(h) of this section is not demonstrated simultaneously during a set of test\nruns, the operating conditions of additional test runs required to demonstrate\ncompliance with remaining emissions standards must be as close as possible to\nthe original operating conditions. (2)\n\nPrior to obtaining test data for purposes\nof demonstrating compliance with the applicable emissions standards of\nsubdivisions (e) through (h) of this section or establishing limits on\noperating parameters under this subdivision, the facility must operate under\ncompliance test conditions for a sufficient period to reach steady-state\noperations. Industrial furnaces that recycle collected particulate matter back\ninto the furnace and that comply with subclauses\n(b)(1)\nor\n(2)\nof this subparagraph, however, need not reach steady state\nconditions with respect to the flow of metals in the system prior to beginning\ncompliance testing for metals. (3)\n\nCompliance test data on the level of an operating parameter, for which a limit\nmust be established in the certification of compliance, must be obtained during\nemissions sampling for the pollutant(s)\n(i.e., metals, PM, HCl/Cl\n2, organic compounds) for which the parameter\nmust be established as specified by subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. (iv)\n\nCertification of compliance. Within 90\ndays of completing compliance testing, the owner or operator must certify to\nthe commissioner compliance with the emissions standards of paragraphs (e)(2), (3) and (5) and subdivisions (f), (g) and (h) of this section and subclause\n(1)(v)\n(a)(4)\nof this subdivision.

(b) Specific information on each test, including: (1)\npurpose(s) of test\n(\ne.g., demonstrate conformance with the emissions limits for\nparticulate matter, metals, HCl, Cl\n2, and CO); (2)\nsummary of test results for each run and\nfor each test including the following information: (i) date of run; (ii)\nduration of run; (iii)\ntime-weighted average and highest\nhourly rolling average CO level for each run and for the test; (iv)\nhighest hourly rolling average HC level, if HC monitoring is required for each run and for the test; (v) if dioxin and furan testing is required\nunder paragraph (e)(5) of this section, time-weighted average emissions for\neach run and for the test of chlorinated dioxin and furan emissions, and the\npredicted maximum annual average ground level concentration of the toxicity\nequivalency factor; (vi)\ntime-weighted average particulate matter emissions for each run and for the\ntest; (vii)\ntime-weighted average\nHCl and Cl\n2\nemissions for each run and for the\ntest; (viii)\ntime-weighted average\nemissions for the metals subject to regulation under subdivision (g) of this\nsection for each run and for the test; and\n(ix)\nQA/QC results. (c) Comparison of the actual\nemissions during each test with the emissions limits prescribed by paragraphs\n(e)(2), (3) and (5) and subdivisions (f), (g) and (h) of this section and\nestablished for the facility in the certification of precompliance under\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. (d) Determination of operating limits based\non all valid runs of the compliance test for each applicable parameter listed\nin subparagraph (i) of this paragraph using either of the following procedures: (1)\n\nInstantaneous limits. A parameter may be\nmeasured and recorded on an instantaneous basis\n(i.e., the\nvalue that occurs at any time) and the operating limit specified as the\ntime-weighted average during all runs of the compliance test; or\n(2)\nhourly rolling average basis. (i) The limit for a parameter may be\nestablished and continuously monitored on an hourly rolling average basis\ndefined as follows: (A)\nA continuous monitor\nis one which continuously samples the regulated parameter without interruption, and evaluates the detector response at least once each 15 seconds, and computes\nand records the average value at least every 60 seconds. (B)\n\nAn hourly rolling average is the\narithmetic mean of the 60 most recent one-minute average values recorded by the\ncontinuous monitoring system. (ii)\n\nThe operating limit for the parameter\nshall be established based on compliance test data as the average over all test\nruns of the highest hourly rolling average value for each run. (3)\n\nRolling average limits for\ncarcinogenic metals and lead. Feed rate limits for the carcinogenic metals\n(i.e., arsenic, berylllum, cadmium and chromium) and lead may\nbe established either on an hourly rolling average basis as prescribed by\nsubclause (2) of this clause or on (up to) a 24-hour rolling average basis. If\nthe owner or operator elects to use an averaging period from two to 24 hours: (i) the feed rate of each metal shall be\nlimited at any time to 10 times the feed rate that would be allowed on an\nhourly rolling average basis; (ii)\nthe continuous monitor shall meet the following specifications: (A)\nA continuous monitor is one which\ncontinuously samples the regulated parameter without interruption, and\nevaluates the detector response at least once each 15 seconds, and computes and\nrecords the average value at least every 60 seconds; (B)\n\nThe rolling average for the selected\naveraging period is defined as arithmetic mean of one hour block averages for\nthe averaging period. A one hour block average is the arithmetic mean of the\none minute averages recorded during the 60-minute period beginning at one\nminute after the beginning of preceding clock hour; and\n(iii)\nthe operating limit for the feed rate\nof each metal shall be established based on compliance test data as the average\nover all test runs of the highest hourly rolling average feed rate for each\nrun. (4)\n\nFeed rate\nlimits for metals, total chloride and chlorine, and ash. Feed rate limits for\nmetals, total chlorine and chloride, and ash are established and monitored by\nknowing the concentration of the substance (\ni.e., metals, chloride/chlorine, and ash) in each feedstream and the flow rate of the\nfeedstream. To monitor the feed rate of these substances, the flow rate of each\nfeedstream must be monitored under the continuous monitoring requirements of\nsubclauses (\n1\n) through (\n3\n) of this\nclause. (e) Certification of compliance statement. The following statement shall accompany\nthe certification of compliance: \"I certify under penalty of law that this information was\nprepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed\nto ensure that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluated the\ninformation and supporting documentation. Copies of all emissions tests, dispersion modeling results and other information used to determine conformance\nwith the requirements of 6 NYCRR section\n374-1.8\n(d)(3)\nare\navailable at the facility and can be obtained from the facility contact person\nlisted above. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manages the\nfacility, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete.

(b) The owner or operator may request a\ncase-by-case extension of time to extend any time limit provided by paragraph\n(3) of this subdivision if compliance with the time limit is not practicable\nfor reasons beyond the control of the owner or operator. (1)\n\nIn granting an extension, the\ncommissioner may apply conditions as the facts warrant to ensure timely\ncompliance with the requirements of this subdivision and that the facility\noperates in a manner that does not pose a hazard to human health and the\nenvironment. (2)\n\nWhen an owner or\noperator requests an extension of time to enable the facility to comply with\nthe alternative hydrocarbon provisions of paragraph (e)(6) of this section and\nobtain a Part 373 operating permit because the facility cannot meet the HC\nlimit of paragraph (e)(3) of this section: (i) the commissioner shall, in considering whether to grant the extension: (A)\ndetermine whether the owner and operator\nhave submitted in a timely manner a complete Part 373 permit application that\nincludes information required under section\n373-1.5\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(B)\nconsider\nwhether the owner and operator have made a good faith effort to certify\ncompliance with all other emission controls, including the controls on dioxins\nand furans of paragraph (e)(5) of this section and the controls on PM, metals, and HCl/Cl\n2. (ii)\n\nIf an extension is granted, the\ncommissioner shall, as a condition of the extension, require the facility to\noperate under flue gas concentration limits on CO and HC that, based on\navailable information, including information in the Part 373 permit\napplication, are baseline CO and HC levels as defined by subparagraph (e)(6)(i)\nof this section. (3)\n\nThe\ncommissioner will not grant an extension which would result in regulatory\ncontrols less stringent than those in the RCRA-delegated program. (viii)\n\nRevised\ncertification of compliance. The owner or operator may submit at any time a\nrevised certification of compliance (recertification of compliance) under the\nfollowing procedures: (a) prior to submittal\nof a revised certification of compliance, hazardous waste may not be burned for\nmore than a total of 720 hours under operating conditions that exceed those\nestablished under a current certification of compliance, and such burning may\nbe conducted only for purposes of determining whether the facility can operate\nunder revised conditions and continue to meet the applicable emissions\nstandards of subdivisions (e) through (h) of this section; (b) at least 30 days prior to first burning\nhazardous waste under operating conditions that exceed those established under\na current certification of compliance, the owner or operator shall notify the\ncommissioner and submit the following information: (1)\nEPA facility ID number, and facility\nname, contact person, telephone number, and address; (2)\noperating conditions that the owner or\noperator is seeking to revise, and a description of the changes in facility\ndesign or operation that prompted the need to seek to revise the operating\nconditions; (3)\na determination\nthat when operating under the revised operating conditions, the applicable\nemissions standards of subdivisions (e) through (h) of this section are not\nlikely to be exceeded. To document this determination, the owner or operator\nshall submit the applicable information required under subparagraph (2)(ii) of\nthis subdivision; and\n(4)\ncomplete\nemissions testing protocol for any pretesting and for a new compliance test to\ndetermine compliance with the applicable emissions standards of subdivisions\n(e) through (h) of this section when operating under revised operating\nconditions. The protocol shall include a schedule of pre-testing and compliance\ntesting. If the owner and operator revises the scheduled date for the\ncompliance test, he/she shall notify the commissioner, in writing, at least 30\ndays prior to the revised date of the compliance test; (c) conduct a compliance test under the\nrevised operating conditions and the protocol submitted to the commissioner to\ndetermine compliance with the applicable emissions standards of subdivisions\n(e) through (h) of this section; and\n(d) submit a revised certification of\ncompliance under subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. (4)\n\nPeriodic recertifications. The owner or\noperator must conduct compliance testing and submit to the department a\nrecertification of compliance under provisions of paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision within five years from submitting the previous certification or\nrecertification. If the owner or operator seeks to recertify compliance under\nnew operating conditions, he/she must comply with the requirements of\nsubparagraph (3)(viii) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nNoncompliance with certification\nschedule. If the owner or operator does not comply with the interim status\ncompliance schedule provided by paragraphs (2)-(4) of this subdivision, hazardous waste burning must terminate on the date that the deadline is missed, closure activities must begin under paragraph (12) of this subdivision, and\nhazardous waste burning may not resume except under an operating permit issued\nunder section\n373-1.9\n(d) of this\n\nTitle. For purposes of compliance with the closure provisions of paragraph (12)\nof this subdivision and section\n373-3.7\n(c)(4)(ii) and\n(d) of this Title the boiler or industrial\nfurnace has received the known final volume of hazardous waste on the date that\nthe deadline is missed. (6)\n\nStart-up and shut-down. Hazardous waste (except waste fed solely as an\ningredient under the Tier I [or adjusted Tier I] feed rate screening limits for\nmetals and chloride/chlorine) must not be fed into the device during start-up\nand shut-down of the boiler or industrial furnace, unless the device is\noperating within the conditions of operation specified in the certification of\ncompliance. (7)\n\nAutomatic waste\nfeed cutoff. During the compliance test required by subparagraph (3)(iii) of\nthis subdivision, and upon certification of compliance under paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision, a boiler or industrial furnace must be operated with a\nfunctioning system that automatically cuts off the hazardous waste feed when\nthe applicable operating conditions specified in clauses (3)(i)\n(a) and\n(e) through\n(m) of\nthis subdivision deviate from those established in the certification of\ncompliance. In addition: (i) to minimize\nemissions of organic compounds, the minimum combustion chamber temperature (or\nthe indicator of combustion chamber temperature) that occurred during the\ncompliance test must be maintained while hazardous waste or hazardous waste\nresidues remain in the combustion chamber, with the minimum temperature during\nthe compliance test defined as either: (a) if\ncompliance with the combustion chamber temperature limit is based on an hourly\nrolling average, the minimum temperature during the compliance test is\nconsidered to be the average over all runs of the lowest hourly rolling average\nfor each run; or\n(b) if compliance\nwith the combustion chamber temperature limit is based on an instantaneous\ntemperature measurement, the minimum temperature during the compliance test is\nconsidered to be the time-weighted average temperature during all runs of the\ntest; and\n(ii)\noperating\nparameters limited by the certification of compliance must continue to be\nmonitored during the cutoff, and the hazardous waste feed shall not be\nrestarted until the levels of those parameters comply with the limits\nestablished in the certification of compliance. (8)\n\nFugitive emissions. Fugitive emissions\nmust be controlled by: (i) keeping the\ncombustion zone totally sealed against fugitive emissions; or\n(ii)\nmaintaining the combustion zone pressure\nlower than atmospheric pressure; or\n(iii)\nan alternate means of control that the\nowner or operator can demonstrate provides fugitive emissions control\nequivalent to maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower than atmospheric\npressure. Support for such demonstration shall be included in the operating\nrecord. (9)\n\nChanges. A\nboiler or industrial furnace must cease burning hazardous waste when changes in\ncombustion properties, or feed rates of the hazardous waste, other fuels, or\nindustrial furnace feedstocks, or changes in the boiler or industrial furnace\ndesign or operating conditions deviate from the limits specified in the\ncertification of compliance. (10)\n\nMonitoring and inspections. (i) The owner or\noperator must monitor and record the following, at a minimum, while burning\nhazardous waste: (a) feed rates and\ncomposition of hazardous waste, other fuels, and industrial furnace feed\nstocks, and feed rates of ash, metals, and total chloride and chlorine as\nnecessary to ensure conformance with the certification of precompliance or\ncertification of compliance; (b) carbon monoxide (CO), oxygen, and if applicable, hydrocarbons (HC), on a\ncontinuous basis at a common point in the boiler or industrial furnace\ndownstream of the combustion zone and prior to release of stack gases to the\natmosphere in accordance with the operating limits specified in the\ncertification of compliance. CO, HC, and oxygen monitors must be installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with methods specified in Appendix 49 of\nthis Title; (c) upon the request of\nthe commissioner, sampling and analysis of the hazardous waste (and other fuels\nand industrial furnace feed stocks as appropriate) and the stack gas emissions\nmust be conducted to verify that the operating conditions established in the\ncertification of precompliance or certification of compliance achieve the\napplicable standards of subdivisions (e) through (h) of this section. (ii)\n\nThe boiler or industrial\nfurnace and associated equipment (pumps, valves, pipes, fuel storage tanks, etc.) must be subjected to thorough visual inspection when they contain\nhazardous waste, at least daily for leaks, spills, fugitive emissions, and\nsigns of tampering. (iii)\n\nThe\nautomatic hazardous waste feed cutoff system and associated alarms must be\ntested at least once every seven days when hazardous waste is burned to verify\noperability, unless the owner or operator can demonstrate that weekly\ninspections will unduly restrict or upset operations and that less frequent\ninspections will be adequate. Support for such demonstration shall be included\nin the operating record. At a minimum, operational testing must be conducted at\nleast once every 30 days. (iv)\n\nThese monitoring and inspection data must be recorded and the records must be\nplaced in the operating log. (11)\n\nRecordkeeping. The owner or operator\nmust keep in the operating record of the facility all information and data\nrequired by this subdivision until closure of the boiler or industrial furnace\nunit. (12)\n\nClosure. At closure, the\nowner or operator must remove all hazardous waste and hazardous waste residues\n(including, but not limited to, ash, scrubber waters, and scrubber sludges)\nfrom the boiler or industrial furnace and must comply with section\n373-3.7\n(b) through\n(f) of this Title. (e) Standards to control organic emissions. (1)\nDRE standard. (i) General. Except as provided in\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, a boiler or industrial furnace burning\nhazardous waste must achieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of\n99.99 percent for all organic hazardous constituents in the waste feed. To\ndemonstrate conformance with this requirement, 99.99 percent DRE must be\ndemonstrated during a trial burn for each principal organic hazardous\nconstituent (POHC) designated (under subparagraph [ii] of this paragraph) in\nits permit for each waste feed. DRE is determined for each POHC from the\nfollowing equation: DRE = (1 - (Wout/Win)) * 100\nwhere: Win = Mass feed rate of one principal organic hazardous\nconstituent (POHC) in the hazardous waste fired to the boiler or industrial\nfurnace; and\n\nWout = Mass emission rate of the same POHC present in\nstack gas prior to release to the atmosphere. (ii)\n\nDesignation of POHCs. Principal organic\nhazardous constituents (POHCs) are those compounds for which compliance with\nthe DRF requirements of this subdivision shall be demonstrated in a trial burn\nin conformance with procedures prescribed in section\n373-1.9\n(d) of this\n\nTitle. One or more POHCs shall be designated by the commissioner for each waste\nfeed to be burned. POHCs shall be designated based on the degree of difficulty\nof destruction of the organic constituents in the waste and on their\nconcentrations or mass in the waste feed considering the results of waste\nanalyses submitted with the Part 373 permit application. POHCs are most likely\nto be selected from among those compounds listed in Appendix 23 of this Title\n(see Part 371 of this Title) that are also present in the normal waste feed. However, if the applicant demonstrates to the commissioner's satisfaction that\na compound not listed in Appendix 23 of this Title or not present in the normal\nwaste feed is a suitable indicator of compliance with the DRE requirements of\nthis subdivision, that compound may be designated as a POHC. Such POHCs need\nnot be toxic or organic compounds. (iii)\n\nDioxin-listed waste. A boiler or\nindustrial furnace burning hazardous waste containing (or derived from) EPA\nhazardous wastes numbers F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027 must achieve a\ndestruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.9999 percent for each POHC\ndesignated (under subparagraph [ii] of this paragraph) in its permit. This\nperformance must be demonstrated on POHCs that are more difficult to burn than\ntetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. DRE is\ndetermined for each POHC from the equation in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. In addition, the owner or operator of the boiler or industrial\nfurnace must notify the commissioner of intent to burn EPA hazardous waste\nnumbers F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027. (iv)\n\nAutomatic waiver of DRE trial burn. Owners and operators of boilers operated under the special operating\nrequirements provided by subdivision (k) of this section are considered to be\nin compliance with the DRE standard of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph and\nare exempt from the DRE trial burn. (v) Low risk waste. Owners and operators of\nboilers or industrial furnaces that burn hazardous waste in compliance with the\nrequirements of paragraph (j)(1) of this section are considered to be in\ncompliance with the DRE standard of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph and are\nexempt from the DRE trial burn. (2)\n\nCarbon monoxide standard. (i) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision, the stack gas concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) from a\nboiler or industrial furnace burning hazardous waste cannot exceed 100 ppmv on\nan hourly rolling average basis\n(i.e., over any 60 minute\nperiod), continuously corrected to seven percent oxygen, dry gas\nbasis. (ii)\nCO and oxygen shall be\ncontinuously monitored in conformance with \"Performance Specifications for\n\nContinuous Emission Monitoring of Carbon Monoxide and Oxygen for Incinerators, Boilers, and Industrial Furnaces Burning Hazardous Waste\" in Appendix 49 of\nthis Title. (iii)\n\nCompliance with\nthe 100 ppmv CO limit must be demonstrated during the trial burn (for new\nfacilities or an interim status facility applying for a permit) or the\ncompliance test (for interim status facilities). To demonstrate compliance, the\nhighest hourly rolling average CO level during any valid run of the trial burn\nor compliance test must not exceed 100 ppmv. (3)\n\nAlternative carbon monoxide standard. (i) The stack gas concentration of carbon\nmonoxide (CO) from a boiler or industrial furnace burning hazardous waste may\nexceed the 100 ppmv limit provided that stack gas concentrations of\nhydrocarbons (HC) do not exceed 20 ppmv, except as provided by paragraph (6) of\nthis subdivision for certain industrial furnaces. (ii)\nHC limits must be established under this\nsubdivision on an hourly rolling average basis\n(i.e., over any\n60 minute period), reported as propane, and continuously corrected to seven\npercent oxygen, dry gas basis. (iii)\nHC shall be continuously monitored in\nconformance with \"Performance Specifications for Continuous Emission Monitoring\nof Hydrocarbons for Incinerators, Boilers, and Industrial Furnaces Burning\n\nHazardous Waste\" in Appendix 49 of this Title. CO and oxygen shall be\ncontinuously monitored in conformance with subparagraph (2)(ii) of this\nsubdivision. (iv)\n\nThe alternative\nCO standard is established based on CO data during the trial burn (for a new\nfacility) and the compliance test (for an interim status facility). The\nalternative CO standard is the average over all valid runs of the highest\nhourly average CO level for each run. The CO limit is implemented on an hourly\nrolling average basis, and continuously corrected to seven percent oxygen, dry\ngas basis. (4)\n\nSpecial\nrequirements for furnaces. Owners and operators of industrial furnaces\n(\ne.g., kilns, cupolas) that feed hazardous waste for a purpose\nother than solely as an ingredient (see clause [d][1][v]\n[b]\nof this section) at any location other than the end where products are normally\ndischarged and where fuels are normally fired must comply with the hydrocarbon\nlimits provided by paragraphs (3) or (6) of this subdivision, irrespective of\nwhether stack gas CO concentrations meet the 100 ppmv limit of paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision. (5)\n\nControls for\ndioxins and furans. Owners and operators of boilers and industrial furnaces\nthat are equipped with a dry particulate matter control device that operates\nwithin the temperature range of 450-750° F, and industrial furnaces\noperating under an alternative hydrocarbon limit established under paragraph\n(6) of this subdivision must conduct a site-specific risk assessment as follows\nto demonstrate that emissions of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and\ndibenzofurans do not result in an increased lifetime cancer risk to the\nhypothetical maximum exposed individual (MEI) exceeding 1 in 100,000: (i) during the trial burn (for new facilities\nor an interim status facility applying for a permit) or compliance test (for\ninterim status facilities), determine emission rates of the tetra-octa\ncongeners of chlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (CDDs/CDFs) using\n\nMethod 0023A, Sampling Method for Polychlorinated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and\n\nPolychlorinated Dibenzofurans Emissions from Stationary Sources, EPA\nPublication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle; (ii)\nestimate the\n2,3,7,8-TCDD toxicity equivalence of the tetra-octa CDDs/CDFs congeners using\n\"Procedures for Estimating the Toxicity Equivalence of Chlorinated Dibenzo-\np-Dioxin and Dibenzofuran Congeners\" in Appendix 49 of this Title. Multiply the\nemission rates of CDD/CDF congeners with a toxicity equivalence greater than\nzero (see the procedure) by the calculated toxicity equivalence factor to\nestimate the equivalent emission rate of 2,3,7,8-TCDD; (iii)\nconduct dispersion modeling using\nmethods recommended in appendix W of 40 CFR part\n51\n(Guideline on Air Quality\n\nModels [Revised] and its supplements) as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, the \"Hazardous Waste Combustion Air Quality Screening Procedure,\" which\nis provided in Appendix 49 of this Title, or in Screening Procedures for\n\nEstimating the Air Quality Impact of Stationary Sources as incorporated by\nreference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, to predict the maximum annual average off-site ground level\nconcentration of 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents determined under subparagraph (5)(ii)\nof this subdivision. The maximum annual average concentration must be used when\na person resides on-site; and\n(iv)\nthe ratio of the predicted maximum annual average ground level concentration of\n2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalents to the risk-specific dose for 2,3,7,8-TCDD provided in\n\nAppendix 45 of this Title (2.2 x 10-7) shall not exceed 1.0. (6)\n[\nReserved\n]\n(7)\n\nMonitoring CO and HC in the by-pass duct of a cement kiln. Cement kilns may\ncomply with the carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon limits provided by paragraphs\n(2), (3) and (4) of this subdivision by monitoring in the by-pass duct provided\nthat: (i) hazardous waste is fired only into\nthe kiln and not at any location downstream from the kiln exit relative to the\ndirection of gas flow; and\n(ii)\nthe\nby-pass duct diverts a minimum of 10 percent of kiln off-gas into the\nduct. (8)\n\nUse of\nemissions test data to demonstrate compliance and establish operating limits. Compliance with the requirements of this subdivision must be demonstrated\nsimultaneously by emissions testing or during separate runs under identical\noperating conditions. Further, data to demonstrate compliance with the CO and\nHC limits of this subdivision or to establish alternative CO or HC limits under\nthis subdivision must be obtained during the time that DRE testing, and where\napplicable, CDD/CDF testing under paragraph (5) of this subdivision and\ncomprehensive organic emissions testing under paragraph (6) of this subdivision\nis conducted. (9)\n\nEnforcement. For\nthe purposes of permit enforcement, compliance with the operating requirements\nspecified in the permit (under subdivision [c] of this section) will be\nregarded as compliance with this subdivision. However, evidence that compliance\nwith those permit conditions is insufficient to ensure compliance with the\nrequirements of this subdivision may be information justifying modification or\nrevocation and reissuance of a permit under section\n373-1.7\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (f) Standards to control particulate matter. (1)\nA boiler or industrial furnace burning\nhazardous waste may not emit particulate matter in excess of 180 milligrams per\ndry standard cubic meter (0.08 grains per dry standard cubic foot) after\ncorrection to a stack gas concentration of seven percent oxygen, using\nprocedures prescribed in 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, methods 1 through 5 (see\nsection\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle), and Appendix 49 of this Title. (2)\n\nAn owner or operator meeting the\nrequirements of paragraph (j)(2) of this section for the low risk waste\nexemption is exempt from the particulate matter standard. (3)\n\nOxygen correction. (i) Measured pollutant levels must be\ncorrected for the amount of oxygen in the stack gas according to the formula: Pc = Pm x 14/(E - Y)\n\nWhere: Pc is the corrected concentration of the pollutant in the\nstack gas, Pm is the measured concentration of the pollutant in the\nstack gas, E is the oxygen concentration on a dry basis in the\ncombustion air fed to the device, and\nY is the measured oxygen concentration on a dry basis in\nthe stack. (ii)\n\nFor devices\nthat feed normal combustion air, E will equal 21 percent. For devices that feed\noxygen-enriched air for combustion (that is, air with an oxygen concentration\nexceeding 21 percent), the value of E will be the concentration of oxygen in\nthe enriched air. (iii)\n\nCompliance\nwith all emission standards provided by this section must be based on\ncorrecting to seven percent oxygen using this procedure. (4)\n\nFor the purposes of permit enforcement, compliance with the operating requirements specified in the permit (under\nsubdivision [c] of this section) will be regarded as compliance with this\nsubdivision. However, evidence that compliance with those permit conditions is\ninsufficient to ensure compliance with the requirements of this subdivision may\nbe information justifying modification or revocation and re-issuance of a\npermit under section\n373-1.7\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (g) Standards to control metals emissions. (1)\n\nGeneral. The owner or operator must\ncomply with the metals standards provided by paragraph (2), (3), (4), (5) or\n(6) of this subdivision for each metal listed in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision that is present in the hazardous waste at detectable levels by\nusing appropriate analytical methods that are ELAP certified analytical\nmethods. If ELAP certified methods are not available, analysis should be\nperformed using EPA standard methods. If neither of those are available, the\ndepartment will evaluate and approve proposals to use other methods to ensure\nthat resulting data will meet data quality objectives. (2)\n\nTier I feed rate screening limits. Feed\nrate screening limits for metals are specified in Appendix 41 of this Title as\na function of terrain-adjusted effective stack height and terrain and land use\nin the vicinity of the facility. Criteria for facilities that are not eligible\nto comply with the screening limits are provided in subparagraph (vii) of this\nparagraph. (i) Noncarcinogenic metals. The\nfeed rates of antimony, barium, lead, mercury, thallium, and silver in all feed\nstreams, including hazardous waste, fuels, and industrial furnace feed stocks, shall not exceed the screening limits specified in Appendix 41 of this Title. (a) The feed rate screening limits for\nantimony, barium, mercury, thallium, and silver are based on either: (1)\nan hourly rolling average as defined in\nsubclause (c)(5)(vi)(\na\n)(\n2\n) of this section; or\n(2)\nan instantaneous limit not\nto be exceeded at any time. (b) The feed rate screening limit for lead is\nbased on one of the following: (1)\nan hourly\nrolling average as defined in subclause\n(c)(5)(vi)(\na\n)(\n2\n) of this section; (2)\nan averaging period of two to 24 hours as\ndefined in clause (c)(5)(vi)(\nb\n) of this section with an\ninstantaneous feed rate limit not to exceed 10 times the feed rate that would\nbe allowed on an hourly rolling average basis; or\n(3)\nan instantaneous limit not to be exceeded\nat any time. (ii)\n\nCarcinogenic metals. (a) The feed rates of arsenic, cadmium, beryllium, and chromium in all feed streams, including hazardous waste, fuels, and industrial furnace feed stocks shall not exceed values derived from the\nscreening limits specified in Appendix 41 of this Title. The feed rate of each\nof these metals is limited to a level such that the sum of the ratios of the\nactual feed rate to the feed rate screening limit specified in Appendix 41 of\nthis Title shall not exceed 1.0, as provided by the following equation: Sum from i = 1 to n ofAFR\n(i) /FRSL\n(i) <1.0\nwhere: n = number of carcinogenic metals\nAFR = actual feed rate to the device for metal \"i\"\nFRSL = feed rate screening limit provided by Appendix 41\nof this Title for metal \"i\"\n(b) The feed rate screening limits for the\ncarcinogenic metals are based on either: (1)\nan hourly rolling average; or\n(2)\nan averaging period of two to 24 hours as defined in clause\n(c)(5)(vi)(\nb\n) of this section with an instantaneous feed rate\nlimit not to exceed 10 times the feed rate that would be allowed on an hourly\nrolling average basis. (iii)\n\nTerrain-adjusted effective stack height\n(TESH). (a) The terrain-adjusted effective\nstack height is determined according to the following equation: TESH = Ha+H1-Tr\nwhere: Ha = actual physical stack height\nH1 = plume rise as determined from Appendix 46 of this\n\nTitle as a function of stack flow rate and stack gas exhaust temperature\n\nTr = terrain rise within five kilometers of the\nstack\n(b) The stack height\n(Ha) may not exceed good engineering practice as specified in\n40\nCFR\n51.100(ii)\n(see section\n370.1[e] of this Title). (c) If the\nTESH for a particular facility is not listed in the table in the appendices, the nearest lower TESH listed in the table shall be used. If the TESH is four\nmeters or less, a value of four meters shall be used. (iv)\n\nTerrain type. The screening limits are a\nfunction of whether the facility is located in noncomplex or complex terrain. A\ndevice located where any part of the surrounding terrain within five kilometers\nof the stack equals or exceeds the elevation of the physical stack height (Ha)\nis considered to be in complex terrain and the screening limits for complex\nterrain apply. Terrain measurements are to be made from U.S. Geological Survey\n7.5-minute topographic maps of the area surrounding the facility. (v) Land use. The screening limits are a\nfunction of whether the facility is located in an area where the land use is\nurban or rural. To determine whether land use in the vicinity of the facility\nis urban or rural, procedures provided in Appendix 49 or 50 of this Title shall\nbe used. (vi)\n\nMultiple stacks. Owners and operators of facilities with more than one on-site stack from a\nboiler, industrial furnace, incinerator, or other thermal treatment unit\nsubject to controls of metals emissions under a Part 373 operating permit or\ninterim status controls must comply with the screening limits for all such\nunits assuming all hazardous waste is fed into the device with the worst-case\nstack based on dispersion characteristics. The worst-case stack is determined\nfrom the following equation as applied to each stack: K = HVT\nwhere: K = a parameter accounting for relative influence of\nstack height and plume rise; H = physical stack height (meters); V = stack gas flow rate\n(m\n3\n/second); and\nT = exhaust temperature (degrees K). The stack with the lowest value of K is the worst-case\nstack. (vii)\n\nCriteria for\nfacilities not eligible for screening limits. If any criteria below are met, the Tier I and Tier II screening limits do not apply. Owners and operators of\nsuch facilities must comply with either the Tier III standards provided by\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision or with the adjusted Tier I feed rate\nscreening limits provided by paragraph (5) of this subdivision. (a) the device is located in a narrow valley\nless than one kilometer wide; (b) the device has a stack taller than 20 meters and is located such that the\nterrain rises to the physical height within one kilometer of the\nfacility; (c) the device has a\nstack taller than 20 meters and is located within five kilometers of a\nshoreline of a large body of water such as an ocean or large lake; (d) the physical stack height of any stack is\nless than 2.5 times the height of any building within five building heights or\nfive projected building widths of the stack and the distance from the stack to\nthe closest boundary is within five building heights or five projected building\nwidths of the associated building; or\n(e) the commissioner determines that\nstandards based on site-specific dispersion modeling are required. (viii)\n\nImplementation. The feed\nrate of metals in each feedstream must be monitored to ensure that the feed\nrate screening limits are not exceeded. (3)\n\nTier II emission rate screening limits. Emission rate screening limits are specified in Appendix 41 of this Title as a\nfunction of terrain-adjusted effective stack height and terrain and land use in\nthe vicinity of the facility. Criteria for facilities that are not eligible to\ncomply with the screening limits are provided in subparagraph (2)(vii) of this\nsubdivision. (i) Noncarcinogenic metals. The\nemission rates of antimony, barium, lead, mercury, thallium, and silver shall\nnot exceed the screening limits specified in Appendix 41 of this\n\nTitle. (ii)\n\nCarcinogenic metals. The emission rates of arsenic, cadmium, beryllium, and chromium shall not\nexceed values derived from the screening limits specified in Appendix 41 of\nthis Title. The emission rate of each of these metals is limited to a level\nsuch that the sum of the ratios of the actual emission rate to the emission\nrate screening limit specified in Appendix 41 of this Title shall not exceed\n1.0, as provided by the following equation: Sum from i = 1 to n ofAER\n(i) /ERSL\n(i) <1.0\nwhere: n = number of carcinogenic metals\nAER = actual emission rate for metal \"i\"\nERSL = emission rate screening limit provided by Appendix\n41 of this Title for metal \"i\"\n(iii)\n\nImplementation. The emission rate\nlimits must be implemented by limiting feed rates of the individual metals to\nlevels during the trial burn (for new facilities or an interim status facility\napplying for a permit) or the compliance test (for interim status facilities). The feed rate averaging periods are the same as provided by clauses\n(2)(i)\n(a), (b) and (ii)\n(b) of this subdivision. The feed rate of metals in each feedstream must be\nmonitored to ensure that the feed rate limits for the feedstreams specified\nunder subdivision (c) or (d) of this section are not exceeded. (iv)\n\nDefinitions and limitations. The\ndefinitions and limitations provided by paragraph (2) of this subdivision for\nthe following terms also apply to the Tier II emission rate screening limits\nprovided by paragraph (3) of this subdivision: terrain-adjusted effective stack\nheight, good engineering practice stack height, terrain type, land use, and\ncriteria for facilities not eligible to use the screening limits. (v) Multiple stacks. (a) Owners and operators of facilities with\nmore than one onsite stack from a boiler, industrial furnace, incinerator, or\nother thermal treatment unit subject to controls on metals emissions under a\n\nPart 373 operating permit or interim status controls must comply with the\nemissions screening limits for any such stacks assuming all hazardous waste is\nfed into the device with the worst-case stack based on dispersion\ncharacteristics. (b) The worst-case\nstack is determined by procedures provided in subparagraph (2)(vi) of this\nsubdivision. (c) For each metal, the total emissions of the metal from those stacks shall not exceed the\nscreening limit for the worst-case stack. (4)\n\nTier III and Adjusted Tier I\nsite-specific risk assessment. The requirements of this paragraph apply to\nfacilities complying with either the Tier III or adjusted Tier I controls, except where specified otherwise. (i) General. Conformance with the Tier III metals controls must be demonstrated by\nemissions testing to determine the emission rate for each metal. In addition, conformance with either the Tier III or adjusted Tier I metals controls must be\ndemonstrated by air dispersion modeling to predict the maximum annual average\noff-site ground level concentration for each metal, and a demonstration that\nacceptable ambient levels are not exceeded. (ii)\n\nAcceptable ambient levels. Appendices 44\nand 45 of this Title list the acceptable ambient levels for purposes of this\nsection. Reference air concentrations (RACs) are listed for the noncarcinogenic\nmetals and 1-5 risk-specific doses (RSDs) are listed for the carcinogenic\nmetals. The RSD for a metal is the acceptable ambient level for that metal\nprovided that only one of the four carcinogenic metals is emitted. If more than\none carcinogenic metal is emitted, the acceptable ambient level for the\ncarcinogenic metals is a fraction of the RSD as described in subparagraph (iii)\nof this paragraph. (iii)\n\nCarcinogenic metals. For the carcinogenic metals, arsenic, cadmium, beryllium, and chromium, the sum of the ratios of the predicted maximum annual average\noff-site ground level concentrations (except that on-site concentrations must\nbe considered if a person resides on site) to the risk-specific dose (RSD) for\nall carcinogenic metals emitted shall not exceed 1.0 as determined by the\nfollowing equation: Sum from i = 1 to n of Predicted Ambient Concentration\n(i) /Risk-Specific\n\nDose\n(i) <1.0\nwhere: n = number of carcinogenic metals\n(iv)\n\nNoncarcinogenic metals. For the\nnoncarcinogenic metals, the predicted maximum annual average off-site ground\nlevel concentration for each metal shall not exceed the reference air\nconcentration (RAC). (v) Multiple\nstacks. Owners and operators of facilities with more than one on-site stack\nfrom a boiler, industrial furnace, incinerator, or other thermal treatment unit\nsubject to controls on metals emissions under a Part 373 operating permit or\ninterim status controls must conduct emissions testing (except that facilities\ncomplying with adjusted Tier I controls need not conduct emissions testing) and\ndispersion modeling to demonstrate that the aggregate emissions from all such\non-site stacks do not result in an exceedance of the acceptable ambient\nlevels. (vi)\n\nImplementation. Under\n\nTier III, the metals controls must be implemented by limiting feed rates of the\nindividual metals to levels during the trial burn (for new facilities or an\ninterim status facility applying for a permit) or the compliance test (for\ninterim status facilities). The feed rate averaging periods are the same as\nprovided by clauses (2)(i)(\na\n), (\nb\n) and\n(ii)(\nb\n) of this subdivision. The feed rate of metals in each\nfeedstream must be monitored to ensure that the feed rate limits for the\nfeedstreams specified under subdivision (c) or (d) of this section are not\nexceeded. (5)\n\nAdjusted\n\nTier I feed rate screening limits. The owner or operator may adjust the feed\nrate screening limits provided by Appendix 41 of this Title to account for\nsite-specific dispersion modeling. Under this approach, the adjusted feed rate\nscreening limit for a metal is determined by back-calculating from the\nacceptable ambient levels provided by Appendices 44 and 45 of this Title using\ndispersion modeling to determine the maximum allowable emission rate. This\nemission rate becomes the adjusted Tier I feed rate screening limit. The feed\nrate screening limits for carcinogenic metals are implemented as prescribed in\nsubparagraph (2)(ii) of this subdivision. (6)\n\nAlternative implementation approaches. (i) The commissioner may approve on a\ncase-by-case basis approaches to implement the Tier II or Tier III metals\nemission limits provided by paragraph (3) or (4) of this subdivision\nalternative to monitoring the feed rate of metals in each feedstream. (ii)\n\nThe emission limits provided by\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision must be determined as follows: (a) for each noncarcinogenic metal, by\nback-calculating from the RAC provided in Appendix 44 of this Title to\ndetermine the allowable emission rate for each metal using the dilution factor\nfor the maximum annual average ground level concentration predicted by\ndispersion modeling in conformance with paragraph (8) of this subdivision; and\n(b) for each carcinogenic metal\nby: (1)\nback-calculating from the RSD\nprovided in Appendix 45 of this Title to determine the allowable emission rate\nfor each metal if that metal were the only carcinogenic metal emitted using the\ndilution factor for the maximum annual average ground level concentration\npredicted by dispersion modeling in conformance with paragraph (8) of this\nsubdivision; and\n(2)\nif more than\none carcinogenic metal is emitted, selecting an emission limit for each\ncarcinogenic metal not to exceed the emission rate determined by subclause\n(\n1\n) of this clause such that the sum for all carcinogenic\nmetals of the ratios of the selected emission limit to the emission rate\ndetermined by that clause does not exceed 1.0. (7)\n\nEmission testing. (i) General. Emission testing for metals\nshall be conducted using Method 0060, Determinations of Metals in Stack\n\nEmissions, EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (ii)\n\nHexavalent chromium. Emissions of chromium are assumed to be hexavalent chromium unless the owner or\noperator conducts emissions testing to determine hexavalent chromium emissions\nusing procedures prescribed in Method 0061, Determination of Hexavalent\n\nChromium Emissions from Stationary Sources, EPA Publication SW-846, as\nincorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (8)\n\nDispersion\nmodeling. Dispersion modeling required under this subdivision shall be\nconducted according to methods recommended in \"Guideline on Air Quality Models\n(revised)\" (appendix W of 40 CFR part\n51, as incorporated by reference in\nsection 370.1[e] of this Title, the) \"Hazardous Waste Combustion Air Quality\n\nScreening Procedure\" described in Appendix 49 of this Title, or \"EPA SCREEN\nScreening Procedure\" as described in \"Procedures for Estimating the Air Quality\n\nImpact of Stationary Sources\" (see section 370.1[e] of this Title) to predict\nthe maximum annual average off-site ground level concentration. However, on-site concentrations must be considered when a person resides\non-site. (9)\n\nEnforcement. For the\npurposes of permit enforcement, compliance with the operating requirements\nspecified in the permit (under subdivision [c] of this section) will be\nregarded as compliance with this subdivision. However, evidence that compliance\nwith those permit conditions is insufficient to ensure compliance with the\nrequirements of this subdivision may be information justifying modification or\nrevocation and reissuance of a permit under section\n373-1.7\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (h) Standards to control hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine gas\n(Cl\n2\n) emissions. (1)\n\nGeneral. The owner or operator must\ncomply with the hydrogen chloride (HCl) and chlorine\n(Cl\n2\n) controls provided by paragraph (2), (3) or (5) of\nthis subdivision. (2)\n\nScreening\nlimits. (i) Tier I feed rate screening\nlimits. Feed rate screening limits are specified for total chlorine in Appendix\n42 of this Title as a function of terrain-adjusted effective stack height and\nterrain and land use in the vicinity of the facility. The feed rate of total\nchlorine and chloride, both organic and inorganic, in all feedstreams, including hazardous waste, fuels, and industrial furnace feed stocks shall not\nexceed the levels specified. (ii)\n\nTier II emission rate screening limits. Emission rate screening limits for HCl\nand Cl\n2\nare specified in Appendix 43 of this Title as a\nfunction of terrain-adjusted effective stack height and terrain and land use in\nthe vicinity of the facility. The stack emission rates of HCl and\n\nCl\n2\nshall not exceed the levels specified. (iii)\n\nDefinitions and limitations. The\ndefinitions and limitations provided by paragraph (g)(2) of this section for\nthe following terms also apply to the screening limits provided by this\nparagraph: terrain-adjusted effective stack height, good engineering practice\nstack height, terrain type, land use, and criteria for facilities not eligible\nto use the screening limits. (iv)\n\nMultiple stacks. Owners and operators of facilities with more than one on-site\nstack from a boiler, industrial furnace, incinerator, or other thermal\ntreatment unit subject to controls on HCl or Cl\n2\nemissions under a Part 373 operating permit or interim status controls must\ncomply with the Tier I and Tier II screening limits for those stacks, assuming\nall hazardous waste is fed into the device with the worst-case stack based on\ndispersion characteristics. (a) The\nworst-case stack is determined by procedures provided in subparagraph\n(g)(2)(vi) of this section. (b) Under Tier I, the total feed rate of chlorine and chloride to all subject\ndevices shall not exceed the screening limit for the worst-case\nstack. (c) Under Tier II, the total\nemissions of HCl and Cl\n2\nfrom all subject stacks shall\nnot exceed the screening limit for the worst-case stack. (3)\n\nTier III site-specific risk\nassessments. (i) General. Conformance with\nthe Tier III controls must be demonstrated by emissions testing to determine\nthe emission rate for HCl and Cl\n2, air dispersion\nmodeling to predict the maximum annual average off-site ground level\nconcentration for each compound, and a demonstration that acceptable ambient\nlevels are not exceeded. (ii)\n\nAcceptable ambient levels. Appendix 44 of this Title lists the reference air\nconcentrations (RACs) for HCl (seven micrograms per cubic meter) and\n\nCl\n2\n(0.4 micrograms per cubic meter). (iii)\n\nMultiple stacks. Owners and operators\nof facilities with more than one on-site stack from a boiler, industrial\nfurnace, incinerator, or other thermal treatment unit subject to controls on\nHCl or Cl\n2\nemissions under a Part 373 operating permit\nor interim status controls must conduct emissions testing and dispersion\nmodeling to demonstrate that the aggregate emissions from all such on-site\nstacks do not result in an exceedance of the acceptable ambient levels for HCl\nand Cl\n2. (4)\n\nAveraging periods. The HCl and\n\nCl\n2\ncontrols are implemented by limiting the feed rate\nof total chlorine and chloride in all feedstreams, including hazardous waste, fuels, and industrial furnace feed stocks. Under Tier I, the feed rate of total\nchloride and chlorine is limited to the Tier I Screening Limits. Under Tier II\nand Tier III, the feed rate of total chloride and chlorine is limited to the\nfeed rates during the trial burn (for new facilities or an interim status\nfacility applying for a permit) or the compliance test (for interim status\nfacilities). The feed rate limits are based on either: (i) an hourly rolling average as defined in\nsubparagraph (c)(5)(vi) of this section; or\n(ii)\nan instantaneous basis not to be\nexceeded at any time. (5)\n\nAdjusted Tier I feed rate screening\nlimits. The owner or operator may adjust the feed rate screening limit provided\nby Appendix 42 of this Title to account for site-specific dispersion modeling. Under this approach, the adjusted feed rate screening limit is determined by\nback-calculating from the acceptable ambient level for\n\nCl\n2\nprovided by Appendix 44 of this Title using\ndispersion modeling to determine the maximum allowable emission rate. This\nemission rate becomes the adjusted Tier I feed rate screening limit. (6)\n\nEmissions testing. Emissions testing for\nHCl and Cl\n2\nshall be conducted using the procedures\ndescribed in Method 0050 or 0051, EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by\nreference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (7)\n\nDispersion modeling. Dispersion modeling shall be conducted according to the provisions of paragraph\n(g)(8) of this section. (8)\n\nEnforcement. For the purposes of permit enforcement, compliance with the\noperating requirements specified in the permit (under subdivision [c] of this\nsection) will be regarded as compliance with this subdivision. However, evidence that compliance with those permit conditions is insufficient to ensure\ncompliance with the requirements of this subdivision may be information\njustifying modification or revocation and reissuance of a permit under section\n373-1.7\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (i) Small\nquantity on-site burner exemption. (1)\n\nExempt quantities. Owners and operators of facilities that burn hazardous waste\nin an on-site boiler or industrial furnace are exempt from the requirements of\nthis section provided that: (i) the quantity\nof hazardous waste burned in a device for a calendar month does not exceed the\nlimits provided in the following table based on the terrain-adjusted effective\nstack height as defined in subparagraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section: Exempt Quantities for Small Quantity Burner\n\nExemption\n\nTerrain-adjusted\n\nAllowable\nhazardous\neffective stack\nheight\nwaste burning\nrate\nof device\n(meters)\n(gallons/month)\n0 to 3.9\n0\n4.0 to 5.9\n13\n6.0 to 7.9\n18\n8.0 to 9.9\n27\n10.0 to 11.9\n40\n12.0 to 13.9\n48\n14.0 to 15.9\n59\n16.0 to 17.9\n69\n18.0 to 19.9\n76\n20.0 to 21.9\n84\n22.0 to 23.9\n93\n24.0 to 25.9\n100\n26.0 to 27.9\n110\n28.0 to 29.9\n130\n30.0 to 34.9\n140\n35.0 to 39.9\n170\n40.0 to 44.9\n210\n45.0 to 49.9\n260\n50.0 to 54.9\n330\n55.0 to 59.9\n400\n60.0 to 64.9\n490\n65.0 to 69.9\n610\n70.0 to 74.9\n680\n75.0 to 79.9\n760\n80.0 to 84.9\n850\n85.0 to 89.9\n960\n90.0 to 94.9\n1,100\n95.0 to 99.9\n1,200\n100.0 to 104.9\n1,300\n105.0 to 109.9\n1,500\n110.0 to 114.9\n1,700\n115.0 or greater\n1,900\n(ii)\nthe maximum hazardous waste firing rate\ndoes not exceed, at any time, one percent of the total fuel requirements for\nthe device (hazardous waste plus other fuel) on a total heat input or mass\ninput basis, whichever results in the lower mass feed rate of hazardous\nwaste; (iii)\nthe hazardous waste\nhas a minimum heating value of 5,000 Btu/lb, as generated; and\n(iv)\nthe hazardous waste fuel does not\ncontain (and is not derived from) EPA hazardous waste numbers F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027. (2)\n\nMixing with nonhazardous fuels. If hazardous waste fuel is mixed with a\nnon-hazardous fuel, the quantity of hazardous waste before such mixing is used\nto comply with paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nMultiple stacks. If an owner or operator\nburns hazardous waste in more than one on-site boiler or industrial furnace\nexempt under this subdivision, the quantity limits provided by subparagraph\n(1)(i) of this subdivision are implemented according to the following equation: Sum from i = 1 to n of Actual Quantity Burned\n(i) /Allowable Quantity Burned\n(i) < 1.0\nwhere: n means the number of stacks; Actual Quantity Burned means the waste quantity burned\nper month in device \"i.\"\nAllowable Quantity Burned, means the maximum allowable\nexempt quantity for stack \"i\" from the table in subparagraph (1)(i) of this\nsubdivision. Hazardous wastes that are subject to the special\nrequirements for small quantity generators under subdivision\n371.1\n(f) of this\n\nTitle may be burned in an off-site device under the exemption provided by this\nsubdivision, but must be included in the quantity determination for the\nexemption. (4)\n\nNotification\nrequirements. The owner or operator of facilities qualifying for the small\nquantity burner exemption under this subdivision must provide a one-time\nsigned, written notice to the Department indicating the following: (i) the combustion unit is operating as a\nsmall quantity burner of hazardous waste; (ii)\nthe owner and operator are in compliance\nwith the requirements of this subdivision; and\n(iii)\nthe maximum quantity of hazardous waste\nthat the facility may burn per month as provided by subparagraph (1)(i) of this\nsubdivision. (5)\n\nRecordkeeping requirements. The owner or operator must maintain at the facility\nfor at least three years sufficient records documenting compliance with the\nhazardous waste quantity, firing rate, and heating value limits of this\nsubdivision. At a minimum, these records must indicate the quantity of\nhazardous waste and other fuel burned in each unit per calendar month, and the\nheating value of the hazardous waste. (j) Low risk waste exemption. (1)\n\nWaiver of DRE standard. The DRE standard\nof paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply if the boiler or industrial\nfurnace is operated in conformance with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph and\nthe owner or operator demonstrates by procedures prescribed in subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph that the burning will not result in unacceptable adverse\nhealth effects. (i) The device shall be\noperated as follows: (a) a minimum of 50\npercent of fuel fired to the device shall be fossil fuel, fuels derived from\nfossil fuel, tall oil, or, if approved by the commissioner on a case-by-case\nbasis, other nonhazardous fuel with combustion characteristics comparable to\nfossil fuel. Such fuels are termed primary fuel for purposes of this\nsubdivision. (Tall oil is a fuel derived from vegetable and rosin fatty acids.)\n\nThe 50 percent primary fuel firing rate shall be determined on a total heat or\nmass input basis, whichever results in the greater mass feed rate of primary\nfuel fired; (b) primary fuels and\nhazardous waste fuels shall have a minimum as-fired heating value of 8,000\n\nBtu/lb; (c) the hazardous waste is\nfired directly into the primary fuel flame zone of the combustion chamber; and\n(d) the device operates in\nconformance with the carbon monoxide controls provided by subparagraph\n(e)(2)(i) of this section. Devices subject to the exemption provided by this\nsubdivision are not eligible for the alternative carbon monoxide controls\nprovided by paragraph (e)(3) of this section. (ii)\n\nProcedures to demonstrate that the\nhazardous waste burning will not pose unacceptable adverse public health\neffects are as follows: (a) identify and\nquantify those nonmetal compounds listed in Appendix 23 of this Title (see Part\n371 of this Title) that could reasonably be expected to be present in the\nhazardous waste. The constituents excluded from analysis must be identified and\nthe basis for their exclusion explained; (b) calculate reasonable, worst case emission\nrates for each constituent identified in clause\n(a) of this\nsubparagraph by assuming the device achieves 99.9 percent destruction and\nremoval efficiency. That is, assume that 0.1 percent of the mass weight of each\nconstituent fed to the device is emitted; (c) for each constituent identified in clause\n(a) of this subparagraph, use emissions dispersion modeling to\npredict the maximum annual average ground level concentration of the\nconstituent. (1)\n\nDispersion modeling shall be\nconducted using methods specified in paragraph (g)(8) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nOwners and operators\nof facilities with more than one on-site stack from a boiler or industrial\nfurnace that is exempt under this subdivision must conduct dispersion modeling\nof emissions from all stacks exempt under this subdivision to predict ambient\nlevels prescribed by this paragraph. (d) Ground level concentrations of\nconstituents predicted under clause\n(c) of this subparagraph\nmust not exceed the following levels: (1)\nfor\nthe noncarcinogenic compounds listed in Appendix 44 of this Title, the levels\nestablished in Appendix 44 of this Title; (2)\nfor the carcinogenic compounds listed in\n\nAppendix 45 of this Title, the sum for all constituents of the ratios of the\nactual ground level concentration to the level established in Appendix 45 of\nthis Title cannot exceed 1.0; and\n(3)\nfor constituents not listed in Appendix\n44 or 45 of this Title, 0.1 micrograms per cubic meter. (2)\n\nWaiver of\nparticulate matter standard. The particulate matter standard of subdivision (f)\nof this section does not apply if: (i) the DRE\nstandard is waived under paragraph (1) of this subdivision; and\n(ii)\nthe owner or operator complies with the\n\nTier I or adjusted Tier I metals feed rate screening limits provided by\nparagraph (g)(2) or (5) of this section. (k) Waiver of DRE trial burn for\nboilers. Boilers that operate under the special requirements of\nthis subdivision, and that do not burn hazardous waste containing (or derived\nfrom) EPA hazardous waste numbers F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, or F027, are\nconsidered to be in conformance with the DRE standard of paragraph (e)(1) of\nthis section, and a trial burn to demonstrate DRE is waived. When burning\nhazardous waste: (1)\na minimum of 50\npercent of fuel fired to the device shall be fossil fuel, fuels derived from\nfossil fuel, tall oil, or, if approved by the commissioner on a case-by-case\nbasis, other nonhazardous fuel with combustion characteristics comparable to\nfossil fuel. Such fuels are termed primary fuel for purposes of this\nsubdivision. (Tall oil is a fuel derived from vegetable and rosin fatty acids.)\n\nThe 50 percent primary fuel firing rate shall be determined on a total heat or\nmass input basis, whichever results in the greater mass feed rate of primary\nfuel fired; (2)\nboiler load shall\nnot be less than 40 percent. Boiler load is the ratio at any time of the total\nheat input to the maximum design heat input; (3)\nprimary fuels and hazardous waste fuels\nshall have a minimum as-fired heating value of 8,000 Btu/lb, and each material\nfired in a burner where hazardous waste is fired must have a heating value of\nat least 8,000 Btu/lb, as fired; (4)\nthe device shall operate in conformance\nwith the carbon monoxide standard provided by subparagraph (e)(2)(i) of this\nsection. Boilers subject to the waiver of the DRE trial burn provided by this\nsubdivision are not eligible for the alternative carbon monoxide standard\nprovided by paragraph (e)(3) of this section; (5)\nthe boiler must be a watertube type\nboiler that does not feed fuel using a stoker or stoker type mechanism; and\n(6)\nthe hazardous waste shall\nbe fired directly into the primary fuel flame zone of the combustion chamber\nwith an air or steam atomization firing system, mechanical atomization system, or a rotary cup atomization system under the following conditions: (i) viscosity. The viscosity of the hazardous\nwaste fuel as-fired shall not exceed 300 SSU; (ii)\nparticle size. When a high pressure air\nor steam atomizer, low pressure atomizer, or mechanical atomizer is used, 70\npercent of the hazardous waste fuel must pass through a 200 mesh (74 micron)\nscreen, and when a rotary cup atomizer is used, 70 percent of the hazardous\nwaste must pass through a 100 mesh (150 micron) screen; (iii)\nmechanical atomization systems. Fuel\npressure within a mechanical atomization system and fuel flow rate shall be\nmaintained within the design range taking into account the viscosity and\nvolatility of the fuel; (iv)\nrotary\ncup atomization systems. Fuel flow rate through a rotary cup atomization system\nmust be maintained within the design range taking into account the viscosity\nand volatility of the fuel. (l) Standards for direct\ntransfer. (1)\n\nApplicability. The\nregulations in this subdivision apply to owners and operators of boilers and\nindustrial furnaces subject to subdivision (c) or (d) of this section if\nhazardous waste is directly transferred from a transport vehicle to a boiler or\nindustrial furnace without the use of a storage unit. (2)\n\nDefinitions. (i) When used in this subdivision, the\nfollowing terms have the meanings given below: (a) Direct transfer\nequipment\nmeans any device (including but not limited to, such devices\nas piping, fittings, flanges, valves, and pumps) that is used to distribute, meter, or control the flow of hazardous waste between a container\n(i.e., transport vehicle) and a boiler or industrial\nfurnace.

(ii)\n\nDirect\ntransfer equipment used for pumpable hazardous waste shall always be closed, except when necessary to add or remove the waste, and shall not be opened, handled, or stored in a manner that may cause any rupture or leak. (iii)\n\nThe direct transfer of hazardous waste\nto a boiler or industrial furnace shall be conducted so that it does not: (a) generate extreme heat or pressure, fire, explosion, or violent reaction; (b) produce uncontrolled toxic mists, fumes, dusts, or gases in sufficient\nquantities to threaten human health; (c) produce uncontrolled flammable fumes or\ngases in sufficient quantities to pose a risk of fire or explosions; (d) damage the structural integrity of the\ncontainer or direct transfer equipment containing the waste; (e) adversely affect the capability of the\nboiler or industrial furnace to meet the standards provided by subdivisions (e)\nthrough (h) of this section; or\n(f) threaten human health or the environment. (iv)\n\nHazardous waste shall not be placed in\ndirect transfer equipment if it could cause the equipment or its secondary\ncontainment system to rupture, leak, corrode, or otherwise fail. (v) The owner or operator of the facility\nshall use appropriate controls and practices to prevent spills and overflows\nfrom the direct transfer equipment or its secondary containment systems. These\ninclude, at a minimum: (a) spill prevention\ncontrols (\ne.g., check valves, dry discount couplings); and\n(b) automatic waste feed cutoff\nto use if a leak or spill occurs from the direct transfer equipment. (4)\n\nAreas where direct\ntransfer vehicles (containers) are located. Applying the definition of\ncontainer under this subdivision, owners and operators must comply with the\nfollowing requirements: (i) the containment\nrequirements of section\n373-2.9\n(f) of this\n\nTitle; (ii)\nthe use and management\nrequirements of section\n373-3.9\nof this Title, except for\nsubdivisions (a) and (e) of such section, and except that in lieu of the\nspecial requirements of section\n373-3.9\n(f) of this\n\nTitle forignitable or reactive waste, the owner or operator may comply with the\nrequirements for the maintenance of protective distances between the waste\nmanagement area and any public ways, streets, alleys, or an adjacent property\nline that can be built upon as required in Tables 2-1 through 2-6 of the\n\nNational Fire Protection Association's (MFPA) \"Flammable and Combustible\n\nLiquids Code,\" (see section 370.1[e] of this Title).

(a) The owner\nor operator must inspect at least once each operating hour when hazardous waste\nis being transferred from the transport vehicle (container) to the boiler or\nindustrial furnace: (1)\noverfill/spill control\nequipment (\ne.g., waste-feed cutoff systems, bypass systems, and drainage systems) to ensure that it is in good working order; (2)\nthe above ground portions of the direct\ntransfer equipment to detect corrosion, erosion, or releases of waste\n(\ne.g., wet spots, dead vegetation); and\n(3)\ndata gathered from monitoring equipment\nand leak-detection equipment, (\ne.g., pressure and temperature\ngauges) to ensure that the direct transfer equipment is being operated\naccording to its design. (b) The owner or operator must inspect\ncathodic protection systems, if used, to ensure that they are functioning\nproperly according to the schedule provided by section 373 3.10(f)(2) of this\n\nTitle. (c) Records of inspections\nmade under this subparagraph shall be maintained in the operating record at the\nfacility, and available for inspection for at least three years from the date\nof the inspection. (iv)\n\nDesign and installation of new ancillary equipment. Owners and operators must\ncomply with the requirements of section\n373-3.10\n(c) of\nthis Title. (v) Response to leaks\nor spills. Owners and operators must comply with the requirements of section\n373-3.10\n(g) of\nthis Title. (vi)\n\nClosure. Owners\nand operators must comply with the requirements of section\n373-3.10\n(h) of\nthis Title, except for subparagraphs (3)(ii) through (iv) of such\nsection. (m) Regulation of residues. A residue derived from the burning or processing of\nhazardous waste in a boiler or industrial furnace is not excluded from the\ndefinition of a hazardous waste under section\n371.1\n(e)(2)(iv), (vi) or\n(vii)\nof this Title unless the device and the\nowner or operator meet the following requirements: (1)\nthe device meets the following criteria: (i) boilers. Boilers must burn at least 50\npercent coal on a total heat input or mass input basis, whichever results in\nthe greater mass feed rate of coal; (ii)\nore or mineral furnaces. Industrial\nfurnaces subject, to section\n371.1\n(e)(2)(vi)\nof\nthis Title must process at least 50 percent by weight normal, non-hazardous raw\nmaterials; (iii)\ncement kilns. Cement kilns must process at least 50 percent by weight normal\ncement-production raw materials; (2)\nthe owner or operator demonstrates that\nthe hazardous waste does not significantly affect the residue by demonstrating\nconformance with either of the following criteria: (i) comparison of waste-derived residue with\nnormal residue. The waste-derived residue must not contain Appendix 23 of this\n\nTitle (see Part 371 of this Title) constituents (toxic constituents) that could\nreasonably be attributable to the hazardous waste at concentrations\nsignificantly higher than in residue generated without burning or processing of\nhazardous waste, using the following procedure. Toxic compounds that could\nreasonably be attributable to burning or processing the hazardous waste\n(constituents of concern) include toxic constituents in the hazardous waste, and the organic compounds listed in Appendix 48 of this Title that may be\ngenerated as products of incomplete combustion. For polychlorinated\ndibenzo-p-dioxins and polychlorinated dibenzo-furans, analyses must be\nperformed to determine specific congeners and homologues, and the results\nconverted to 2,3,7,8-TCDD equivalent values using the procedure specified in\nsection 4.0 of 40 CFR part\n266\nappendix IX as incorporated by reference in\n\nAppendix 49 of this Title. (a) normal\nresidue. Concentrations of toxic constituents of concern in normal residue\nshall be determined based on analyses of a minimum of 10 samples representing a\nminimum of 10 days of operation. Composite samples may be used to develop a\nsample for analysis provided that the compositing period does not exceed 24\nhours. The upper tolerance limit (at 95 percent confidence with a 95 percent\nproportion of the sample distribution) of the concentration in the normal\nresidue shall be considered the statistically-derived concentration in the\nnormal residue. If changes in raw materials or fuels reduce the\nstatistically-derived concentrations of the toxic constituents of concern in\nthe normal residue, the statistically-derived concentrations must be revised or\nstatistically-derived concentrations of toxic constituents in normal residue\nmust be established for a new mode of operation with the new raw material or\nfuel. To determine the upper tolerance limit in the normal residue, the owner\nor operator shall use statistical procedures prescribed in \"Statistical\n\nMethodology for Bevill Residue Determinations\" in Appendix 49 of this\n\nTitle; (b) waste-derived residue. Waste-derived residue shall be sampled and analyzed as often as necessary to\ndetermine whether the residue generated during each 24-hour period has\nconcentrations of toxic constituents that are higher than the concentrations\nestablished for the normal residue under clause (\na\n) of this\nsubparagraph. If so, hazardous waste burning has significantly affected the\nresidue and the residue shall not be excluded from the definition of a\nhazardous waste. Concentrations of toxic constituents of concern in the waste\nderived residue shall be determined based on analysis of one or more samples\nobtained over a 24-hour period. Multiple samples may be analyzed, and multiple\nsamples may be taken to form a composite sample for analysis provided that the\nsampling period does not exceed 24 hours. If more than one sample is analyzed\nto characterize waste- derived residues generated over a 24-hour period, the\nconcentration of each toxic constituent shall be the arithmetic mean of the\nconcentrations in the samples. No results may be disregarded; or\n(ii)\ncomparison of waste-derived\nresidue concentrations with health-based limits; (a) nonmetal constituents. The concentration\nof each nonmetal toxic constituent of concern (specified in subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph) in the waste-derived residue must not exceed the health-based\nlevel specified in Appendix 47 of this Title, or the level of detection, whichever is higher. If a health-based limit for a constituent of concern is\nnot listed in Appendix 47 of this Title, then a limit of 0.002 micrograms per\nkilogram or the level of detection, whichever is higher, must be used. The\nconcentration of each non-metal toxic constituent of concern and the level of\ndetection must be established through the use of appropriate analytical methods\nthat are ELAP certified analytical methods. If ELAP certified methods are not\navailable, analysis should be performed using EPA standard methods. If neither\nof those are available, the department will evaluate and approve proposals to\nuse other methods to ensure that resulting data will meet data quality\nobjectives. The levels specified in Appendix 47 of this Title (and the default\nlevel of 0.002 micrograms per kilogram or the level of detection for\nconstituents as identified in Note 1 of Appendix 47 of this Title) are\nadministratively stayed under the condition, for those constituents specified\nin subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, that the owner or operator complies with\nalternative levels defined as the land disposal restriction limits specified in\nsection\n376.4\n(d) of this\n\nTitle for F039 nonwastewaters. In complying with those alternative levels, if\nan owner or operator is unable to detect a constituent despite documenting use\nof best good-faith efforts as defined by applicable EPA guidance or standards, the owner or operator is deemed to be in compliance for that constituent. Until\nnew guidance or standards are developed, the owner or operator may demonstrate\nsuch good-faith efforts by achieving a detection limit for the constituent that\ndoes not exceed an order of magnitude above the level provided by section\n376.4\n(d) of this\n\nTitle for F039 nonwastewaters. In complying with the section\n376.4\n(d) of this\n\nTitle F039 nonwastewater levels for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and\npolychlorinated dibenzo-furans, (unless the owner or operator complies with\nalternative levels defined as the land disposal restriction limits specified in\nsection\n376.4\n(d) of this\n\nTitle for F039 nonwastewaters,) analyses must be performed for total\nhexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, total hexachlorodibenzofurans, total\npentachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, total pentachlorodibenzofurans, total\ntetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins, and total tetrachlorodibenzofurans; and\n(b) metal constituents. The concentration of\nmetals in an extract obtained using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching\n\nProcedure of section\n371.3\n(e) of this\n\nTitle must not exceed the levels specified in Appendix 47 of this Title; and\n(c) sampling and analysis. Waste-derived residue shall be sampled and analyzed as often as necessary to\ndetermine whether the residue generated during each 24-hour period has\nconcentrations of toxic constituents that are higher than the health-based\nlevels. Concentrations of toxic constituents of concern in the waste-derived\nresidue shall be determined based on analysis of one or more samples obtained\nover a 24-hour period. Multiple samples may be analyzed, and multiple samples\nmay be taken to form a composite sample for analysis provided that the sampling\nperiod does not exceed 24 hours. If more than one sample is analyzed to\ncharacterize waste-derived residues generated over a 24-hour period, the\nconcentration of each toxic constituent shall be the arithmetic mean of the\nconcentrations in the samples. No results may be disregarded; and\n(3)\nrecords sufficient\nto document compliance with the provisions of this subdivision shall be\nretained until closure of the boiler or industrial furnace unit. At a minimum, the following shall be recorded; (i) levels\nof constituents in Appendix 23 of this Title that are present in waste-derived\nresidues; (ii)\nif the waste-derived\nresidue is compared with normal residue under subparagraph (2)(i) of this\nsubdivision: (a) the levels of constituents\nin Appendix 23 of this Title that are present in normal residues; and\n(b) data and information, including analyses\nof samples as necessary, obtained to determine if changes in raw materials or\nfuels would reduce the concentration of toxic constituents of concern in the\nnormal residue.
