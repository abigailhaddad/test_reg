  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 500.2 - Standards\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several councils of the State-operated institutions\nof higher learning of the State University of New York shall promulgate or\nreview and ratify regulations governing the conduct and behavior of students, subject to general guidelines established by the chancellor, and in accordance\nwith law and such other rules or policies as the trustees may from time to time\nestablish; such regulations to be published and made available to the whole\nacademic community of that campus and shall be given full force and effect as\nrules and regulations of the State University applicable to that campus. The\nchancellor of the State University of New York shall, from time to time, cause\nto be reviewed the regulations established by the councils for consistency with\nrules and policies of the State University trustees and shall report thereon to\nthe board of trustees at such time and in such manner as it shall\ndirect. (a) The manner in which\nregulations are developed. In order to encourage, maintain and assure adequate\ncommunication with and participation by the administration, faculty and\nstudents at the respective campuses, the council shall act after consultation\nwith the chief administrative head of its campus and with representatives of\nfaculty and students in promulgating or in reviewing and ratifying regulations\non student conduct. In the regulations, the council may confer upon student\ngroups, faculty committees, administrative officers, or combinations thereof\nappropriate responsibilities concerning student conduct and behavior. Authority\nfor the administration of regulations at a campus shall rest with the campuses'\nchief administrative officer. (b) The recognition of the rights and responsibilities of students. The regulations\nshall recognize that students have within the law, the right of free expression\nand advocacy and that the State University seeks to encourage and preserve\nfreedom of expression and inquiry within the entire University. The regulations\nshall also recognize the obligation of each student to conduct himself\nlawfully, maturely and responsibly and shall take into account the\nresponsibility of the University to maintain standards of student conduct\nessential to the orderly conduct of the University's function as an educational\ninstitution. The ways in which students or student groups may use the name of\nthe University or identify their association with it shall also be provided for\nin the regulations. (c) The need\nfor due process. Where regulations govern student disciplinary proceedings, they should reflect the basic concepts of procedural fairness and should make\ncertain that no student shall be expelled or suffer other major disciplinary\naction as defined by the council for any offense, other than failure to meet\nrequired academic standing, without being first given appropriate advance\nnotice of the charges against him and a hearing before an impartial body or\nofficer as established by the council or chief administrative officer at such\ncampus. While a formal judicial hearing is not required, the hearing should be\nof such nature as to give the hearing body or officer, as the case may be, full\nopportunity to hear both sides of the issue in considerable detail. The student\nmay waive in writing the requirements of a hearing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
