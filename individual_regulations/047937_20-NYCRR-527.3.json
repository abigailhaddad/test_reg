  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 527.3 - Sale of information services\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1105[c][1])\n(a) Imposition. (1)\n\nSection\n1105 (c)(1)\nof the Tax Law\nimposes a tax on the receipts from the service of furnishing information by\nprinted, mimeographed or multigraphed matter or by duplicating written or\nprinted matter in any manner such as by tapes, discs, electronic readouts or\ndisplays. (2)\n\nThe collecting, compiling or analyzing information of any kind or nature and the furnishing\nreports thereof to other persons is an information service. (3)\n\nAmong the services which are information\nservices are credit reports, tax or stock market advisory and analysis reports\nand product and marketing surveys. Example 1: A company distributes a newsletter to its subscribers\nweekly, showing the range of daily market prices for certain commodities. The\nnewsletter comprises a taxable information service. Example 2: A company publishes a bound volume monthly, which it\nfurnishes to its subscribers. The volume contains information with respect to\ncurrent advertising rates of various media in different localities. This\npublication is a taxable information service. Example 3: A firm supplies to business concerns listings of\nprospective customers' telephone numbers is providing a taxable information\nservice and must collect the appropriate tax on the charges for such\nservice. Example 4: A computer service company owns a service program\nconsisting of analyses of law cases and statutes. It is asked by a customer to\nresearch all references to the word \"assessment\". The fee for the printout\nreceived by the customer constitutes a taxable receipt from an information\nservice, as the citations listed may be given to another subscriber requesting\nthe same information. (4)\n\nCharges for credit information services, other than those that are transmitted\norally, are subject to tax. The following rules shall apply in determining\ntaxability of services that include both oral and written reports: (i) Any fee for a written report is\ntaxable. (ii)\n\nAny fee for an oral\nreport is taxable if the oral report is preliminary to the written\nreport. (iii)\n\nAn annual fee for\nsubscribing to a service is taxable if it entitles the subscriber to a certain\nnumber of free reports, or to reduced charges on reports, unless the subscriber\nis entitled only to oral reports. Cross reference: Periodicals and newspapers, see Part 528 of this\n\nTitle. (b) Exclusions. (1)\n\nSales tax does not apply to receipts from\nsales of information services which are for resale as such. (2)\n\nThe sales tax does not apply to the\nreceipts from the sale of information which is personal or individual in nature\nand which is not or may not be substantially incorporated into reports\nfurnished to other persons by the person who has collected, compiled or\nanalyzed such information. Example 1: The report submitted by a private detective agency to its\nclients is a personal report, the charge for which is not taxable. Example 2: Automobile insurance damage appraisals performed for\ninsurance companies are individual reports, the fees for which are not subject\nto sales tax. Example 3: A computer service company has a program consisting of\nwithholding tax tables. Using the same program, it computes the payroll for\nseveral subscribers. The fee charged to each subscriber is not taxable as it is\nfor an information service, the results of which are not incorporated into\nreports furnished others. Example 4: A firm is in the business of reading newspapers and\nperiodicals, cutting out all articles in which the name of a customer or a\ntopic of interest to the customer appears, and transferring such clippings to\nthe customer, whether by mail or otherwise, for a fee. This is a service of\nfurnishing information which is taxable. The tax is due on the entire charge\nregardless of the method of billing for the service, including any charge by\nthe firm for shipping or delivery of the clippings to the customer. Even though\nthis information may be individual in nature, it may be incorporated in reports\nfurnished to others. (3)\n\nSales tax does not apply to receipts from sales of information services which\nare only furnished orally. See paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of this\nsection. (4)\n\nThe sale of\ninformation services to newspapers and radio or television broadcasters which\nare used in the collection and dissemination of news is excluded from\ntax. (5)\n\nFees for the services of\nadvertising agencies or other persons acting in a representative capacity are\nexcluded from the tax. Advertising services consist of consultation and\ndevelopment of advertising campaigns, and placement of advertisements with the\nmedia without the transfer of tangible personal property. The furnishing of a\npersonal report containing information derived from information services, by an\nadvertising agency, to its client for a fee is not a taxable information\nservice. However, if an advertising agency is engaged only for the purpose of\nconducting a survey or if a survey is separately authorized and billed to the\ncustomer, the taxability of such survey is determined in accordance with the\nprovisions of subdivision (a) of this section and the other provisions of this\nsubdivision. Sales of tangible personal property such as layouts, printing\nplates, catalogs, mailing devices or promotional handouts, tapes or films by an\nadvertising agency for its own account are taxable sales of tangible personal\nproperty. (See section\n527.1\nof this Part.)\n\nExample 5: An advertising agency is hired to design an advertising\nprogram and to furnish art work and layouts to the media. The fee charged by\nthe agency to its client for this service is not subject to the tax. However, if the layout and artwork is sold by the advertising agency prior to use by it\nto the customer for his use, the advertising agency is making a sale of\ntangible personal property which is subject to sales tax. (c) Purchases by persons\nproviding information and advertising service. (1)\n\nThe purchase of materials used in\nperforming an information service subject to tax under section\n1105 (c)(1)\nof the Tax Law\nis not a retail sale where it is transferred to the purchaser of the service\nand therefore is exempt from the sales tax. (See section\n526.6\nof\nthis Title.) However, where the information service is not subject to tax under\nsection\n1105 (c)(1)\nof the Tax Law, the purchase of materials used in performing the service is taxable to the\nperson rendering the service. Example 1: A credit bureau purchases forms for the furnishing of\ncredit status reports to its clients. The forms purchased are not subject to\nthe sales tax since they were purchased for use in performing a taxable\nservice. Example 2: A firm which computes payroll information purchases forms\nfor the purpose of furnishing reports to its clients. The reports will contain\ninformation which is personal or individual and not a taxable information\nservice. Such purchases by the firm are at retail and subject to the sales\ntax. (2)\n\nAll purchases of\nmaterials by an advertising agency for use in performing its services are\npurchases at retail subject to sales tax. (3)\n\nThe purchase of a service subject to tax\nunder section\n1105 (c)(1)\nof the Tax Law\nby a vendor who will resell that service as such or as a part of a service also\nsubject to tax under section 1105(c)(1) is not a purchase at retail and is\nexempt from the sales tax. Example 3: A vendor of an investment advisory service purchases a\ncommodity information service and stock market information service. Both\nservices purchased by the vendor are incorporated into the service he sells. The vendor may purchase the services he uses for resale without payment of\nsales tax. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
