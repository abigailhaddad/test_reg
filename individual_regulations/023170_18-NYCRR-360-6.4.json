  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 360-6.4 - Restriction of recipient access to services (recipient restriction program)\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe social services district and the department may\nrestrict a recipient's access to MA care and services if, upon review, it is\nfound that the recipient has received duplicative, excessive, contraindicated\nor conflicting health care services, drugs, or supplies. In such cases, the\nsocial services district and the department may require that the recipient\naccess specific types of medical care and services through a designated primary\nprovider or providers. The State medical review team (SMRT) designated by the\ndepartment performs recipient utilization reviews and identifies candidates for\nthe recipient restriction program. (a) Definitions. When used in this section: (1)\n\nGood cause for a restricted recipient to request a change of primary provider\nmeans the existence of one or more of the following circumstances: (i) the provider no longer wishes to be a\nprimary provider for the recipient; or\n(ii)\nthe provider has closed his/her office\nor pharmacy, or moved to a location not convenient to the recipient; or\n(iii)\nthe provider has been\nsuspended or disqualified from participation in the MA program; or\n(iv)\nthe provider is a pharmacist and/or a\ndurable medical equipment (DME) dealer who cannot stock an item for which the\nrecipient has a legitimate prescription or fiscal order; or\n(v) the recipient has moved; or\n(vi)\nother circumstances exist that make it\nnecessary to change providers. (2)\n\nPrimary provider is a health care\nprovider enrolled in the MA program who has agreed to oversee the health care\nneeds of the restricted recipient. The primary provider will provide and/or\ndirect all medically necessary care and services for which the recipient is\neligible, within the provider's category of service or expertise. Primary\nprovider includes physicians, clinics, inpatient hospitals, pharmacies, podiatrists, DME dealers, dentists, and dental clinics. (3)\n\nRecipient is a person who is receiving or\nwho has received MA benefits within the preceding six months, including both\ncurrent and former recipients. (4)\n\nRecipient information packet (RIP) is the utilization review summary prepared\nby the SMRT documenting the reason(s) for a recommended restriction. It will\ninclude a summary pharmacology assessment prepared by the pharmacist\ndocumenting misuse of pharmacy and DME services and summary medical assessments\nprepared by the registered professional nurse documenting misuse of health care\nservices. A physician must sign the RIP, indicating review and approval of the\nrestriction recommendation. (5)\n\nRestriction is an administrative action limiting an MA recipient's access to\nspecific types of medical care and services through a designated primary\nprovider(s). (6)\nSMRT means a team\nconsisting of a registered nurse, a pharmacist and a physician, all of whom are\nlicensed to practice by the State, who act for the department to: (i) analyze recipient use of medical care and\nservices under the MA program; (ii)\nmake recommendations concerning restrictions on recipient use; and\n(iii)\nprepare recipient information\npackets. (b) Recipient restriction. An MA recipient whose use of a category of MA care or\nservice fulfills one or more of the conditions for restriction specified in\nsubdivision (d) of this section may be recommended by the SMRT to the social\nservices district for restriction to a primary provider in that category. A\nrecipient recommended by the SMRT for restriction to a primary provider in a\ncategory of MA care or service other than physician or clinic also may be\nrecommended for restriction to a primary physician or primary clinic if such\nadditional restriction would more effectively control abuse or misuse of MA\ncare, services, drugs, supplies, or appliances. A recipient whose use of\nhospital emergency room services fulfills the condition for restriction\nspecified in paragraph (d)(5) of this section may be recommended by the SMRT to\nthe social services district for restriction to a primary physician or primary\nclinic; such a restriction will not apply to emergency services furnished to\nthe recipient. A primary provider is responsible for providing MA care or\nservices to a restricted recipient as follows: (1)\nA primary physician or primary clinic is\nresponsible for providing all medical care to the restricted recipient, either\ndirectly or through referral of such recipient to another medical provider for\nappropriate services. A primary physician or primary clinic providing medical\ncare for a restricted recipient who also is restricted to a primary inpatient\nhospital must have admitting privileges to or a professional affiliation with\nsuch primary inpatient hospital. A primary physician will receive a management\nfee for the coordination and management of a restricted recipient's care. Such\nmanagement fee will be in the amount of $5 for each month the physician acts as\nprimary physician for a restricted recipient. (2)\nA primary inpatient hospital is\nresponsible for providing all non-emergency inpatient services to the\nrestricted recipient except for services provided pursuant to an authorized\nreferral. A recipient who is restricted to a primary inpatient hospital also\nmust be restricted to a primary physician or primary clinic. (3)\nA primary pharmacy is responsible for\nproviding all necessary drugs and pharmaceutical supplies to the restricted\nrecipient. The primary physician must institute and maintain a current patient\nprofile for the restricted recipient. Such profile must contain, at a minimum, the identity of the prescriber of the drugs and supplies; the strength, quantity and dosage regimen of any drugs; and the dates of service for all\ndrugs and supplies dispensed. The profile must be made readily accessible to\nthe department and its agents. (4)\nA primary dentist or primary dental clinic is responsible for providing or\ndirecting the provision of all dental care for the restricted\nrecipient. (5)\nA primary podiatrist\nis responsible for providing or directing the provision of all podiatric care\nfor the restricted recipient. (6)\nA\nprimary DME dealer is responsible for providing all necessary medical supplies\nand appliances to the restricted recipient and for repairing and adjusting such\nappliances. (7)\nA primary\nphysician, primary clinic, primary dentist or primary dental clinic is\nresponsible for ordering the following services for the restricted recipient: (i) transportation services; if the recipient\nis restricted to a primary physician or primary clinic and a primary dentist or\nprimary dental clinic, the primary physician or primary clinic will be the only\nallowed orderer of transportation services; (ii)\nlaboratory services; (iii)\nDME services; if the recipient also is\nrestricted to a primary DME dealer, that provider will be the only allowed\ndispenser of DME services; and\n(iv)\npharmacy services; if the recipient also is restricted to a primary pharmacy, that provider will be the only allowed dispenser of pharmacy\nservices. (8)\nA primary\nphysician or primary clinic is responsible for ordering inpatient hospital\nservices for a restricted recipient who also is restricted to a primary\ninpatient hospital. (c) Responsibilities of the SMRT. The professional judgment of the SMRT is applied\nto each case review. Use of professional judgment includes, but is not limited\nto: (1)\nidentifying potential hazards to the\nhealth of the recipient; (2)\nidentifying instances in which the misuse of services appears to be caused by\nthe provider. In such instances, the SMRT will refer the provider to the\nappropriate agency for quality of care review and/or administrative or criminal\naction. The SMRT will not recommend that the recipient be restricted; (3)\nidentifying instances where the recipient\nmay have met one of the conditions of restriction, but it appears to have been\nan isolated occurrence, or there appears to have been a legitimate reason for\nthe use cited. In these instances, the SMRT will not recommend that the\nrecipient be restricted; and\n(4)\nrecommending the type of restriction that will control the misuse most\neffectively. (d) Conditions for restriction. Restrictions will be recommended to the social\nservices district if a recipient displays a pattern of receiving one or more of\nthe following: (1)\n\nExcessive drugs, supplies\nor appliances. The recipient has received more of a drug, medical supply or\nappliance in a specified time period than is necessary, according to acceptable\nmedical practice. (2)\n\nDuplicative\ndrugs, supplies or appliances. The recipient has received two or more similarly\nacting drugs in an overlapping time frame or has received duplicative supplies\nor appliances. The drugs, if taken together, may result in harmful drug\ninteraction(s) or adverse reaction(s). Duplicative supplies and appliances, while not harmful, have no medical indication and are therefore\nunwarranted. (3)\n\nDuplicative health\ncare services. The recipient has received health care services from two or more\nproviders for the same or similar conditions in an overlapping time frame. Health care services include, but are not limited to, physician, clinic, pharmacy, dental, podiatry and DME services. (4)\n\nContraindicated care or conflicting care. The recipient has received drugs, supplies or appliances and/or health care\nservices which may be inadvisable in the presence of certain medical conditions\nor which conflict with care being provided or ordered by another\nprovider. (5)\n\nUnnecessary hospital\nemergency room services. The recipient has received services in a hospital\nemergency room for a condition which does not require emergency care or\ntreatment. (6)\n\nExcessive inpatient\nhospital services. The recipient has received multiple inpatient hospital\ndischarges for the same or similar conditions which are more than necessary, according to acceptable medical practice, including but not limited to multiple\ninpatient hospital discharges against medical advice. For purposes of this\nparagraph, discharge against medical advice means discontinuance by a recipient\nof inpatient hospital services contrary to the advice of the attending\nphysician. (7)\n\nAbusive practices by\nrecipients. (i) The following practices\nengaged in by an MA recipient are abusive practices which warrant restriction\nof such recipient to an appropriate type(s) of restriction: (a) a recipient uses or permits an MA\nidentification card to be used to obtain services for an unauthorized\nperson; (b) a recipient presents a\nforged or altered prescription or fiscal order to an enrolled MA provider to\nobtain supplies, drugs or services under the MA program; (c) a recipient is in possession of two or\nmore MA identification cards which represent two or more MA cases; or\n(d) a recipient sells or trades, or attempts\nto sell or trade, drugs or supplies acquired with an MA identification\ncard. (ii)\n\nWhen an MA\nrecipient engages in an abusive practice identified in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, a restriction may be imposed on the recipient for all eligible\ncategories of services or only for those categories of services deemed\nappropriate by the SMRT. (iii)\n\nThe\nimposition of a restriction under this paragraph does not limit the taking by a\nsocial services official, district attorney or other prosecuting official of\nany other action authorized under law with respect to an act which constitutes\na violation of the Social Services Law or Penal Law. (e) Recipient's rights. (1)\n\nSelection of primary provider. The social\nservices district, in consultation with the department, must either designate a\nprimary provider for a restricted recipient or afford the recipient a limited\nchoice of primary providers for the type of services that are to be restricted. If the recipient fails to choose a primary provider when asked to do so, the\nsocial services district must designate a single provider in the restriction\ncategory for the recipient. A recipient may request a change of primary\nprovider every three months, or at an earlier time for good cause. (2)\n\nRecipient notification. A notice of\nintent to restrict must be sent to the recipient. The notice must conform with\nthe requirements of Part 358 of this Title. The notice must include the\nfollowing information: (i) the date the\nrestriction will begin; (ii)\nthe\neffect and scope of the restriction; (iii)\nthe reason for the\nrestriction; (iv)\nthe recipient's\nright to a fair hearing; (v) instructions for requesting a fair hearing including the right to receive aid\ncontinuing if the request is made before the effective date of the intended\naction. Part 358 of this Title contains the provisions on instructions for\nrequesting a fair hearing; (vi)\nthe\nright of a social services district to designate a primary provider for\nrecipient; (vii)\nthe right of the\nrecipient to select a primary provider within two weeks of the date of the\nnotice of intent to restrict, if the social services district affords the\nrecipient a limited choice of primary providers; (viii)\nthe right of the recipient to request\na change of primary provider every three months, or at an earlier time for good\ncause; (ix)\nthe right to a\nconference with a social services district person to discuss the reason for and\neffect of the intended restriction; (x) the right of the recipient to explain and\npresent documentation, either at a conference or by submission, showing the\nmedical necessity of any services cited as misused in the RIP; (xi)\nthe name and telephone number of the\nperson to contact to arrange a conference; (xii)\nthe fact that a conference does not\nsuspend the effective date listed on the notice of intent to\nrestrict; (xiii)\nthe fact that the\nconference does not take the place of or abridge the recipient's right to a\nfair hearing; (xiv)\nthe right of\nthe recipient to examine his/her case record; and\n(xv)\nthe right of the recipient to examine\nrecords maintained by the social services district which can identify MA\nservices paid for on behalf of the recipient. This information is generally\nreferred to as \"claim detail\" or \"recipient profile\" information. (f) Social services\ndistrict responsibilities. (1)\n\nTimeliness. The\nsocial services district must begin to process a restriction recommendation and\ncontact the recipient within 30 days of receipt of the SMRT's recommendation to\nrestrict. (2)\n\nReversal, change, or\nnon-implementation of restriction by the social services district. The social\nservices district may direct not to follow a restriction recommendation after a\nconference or upon receipt of additional information only in the following\nsituations: (i) Administrative reasons. (a) the recipient's case is closed for more\nthan three months from receipt of recommendation; (b) the recipient is\ninstitutionalized; (c) the social\nservices district cannot locate a primary provider of one type to accept\nresponsibility for the recipient and has to substitute another type of provider\nfor example, physician for clinic provider; or\n(d) the recipient participates in another\ncase management or managed care program authorized by the department which the\nsocial services district believes will benefit the recipient more. (ii)\n\nMedical reasons. The\nrecipient can demonstrate a medical necessity for the services received. If, after a conference with the recipient or receipt of additional information, the\nsocial services district decides not to follow the SMRT's recommendation for\nmedical reasons, the steps below must be followed: (a) the recipient must present the RIP\nsummary to an appropriate provider(s) listed in the summary. The provider(s)\nmust submit a statement acknowledging full awareness of all the services, drugs, and supplies listed in the RIP. The provider(s) must explain why the\nservices, drugs and supplies are medically necessary; (b) the social services district must contact\nsuch provider(s) who must submit a statement to verify that he/she saw the RIP\nsummary and that the information on the statement is accurate; (c) the social services district medical\ndirector or a consulting physician having no involvement in the case must sign\nthe case decision not to follow the SMRT's recommendation for medical reasons; and\n(d) documentation and a summary\nmust be forwarded to the department within 30 days of the date on which the\ndecision not to follow the recommended restriction is made. (g) Provider\ncooperation. The social services district must obtain an agreement from the\nprimary provider that he/she will act as a primary provider. A primary provider\nmust be given written confirmation of the recipient's restriction. Such\nconfirmation must include the following: (1)\nthe effective date of the restriction; (2)\nrestriction limitations; and\n(3)\nprovisions for handling referrals (not\napplicable for pharmacy or other ordered service restrictions). (h) Length of restriction. (1)\n\nAn initial restriction period will be for\n24 consecutive months. After the initial period, the department will determine\nif the restriction should be continued. A second restriction period will be for\nthree years. Any additional restriction periods will be for six years. If a\nrestriction is to be continued or reinstated, the social services district must\nnotify the recipient by sending a new letter of intent. The required content of\nthe notice of intent is set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nInitial and additional\nrestriction periods must be computed without regard to eligibility for, or\nreceipt of, MA benefits. All periods of ineligibility or voluntary\ndiscontinuance of receipt of benefits must be counted in determining the length\nof restriction. Recipients who do not remain eligible for benefits or who do\nnot continue to receive them, as well as those who are not receiving benefits\nat the time of the imposition of the restriction, will be treated similarly to\nthose who remain eligible and continue to receive benefits. (For example, a\nrecipient who becomes ineligible for benefits prior to the effective date of\nthe restriction period and, upon subsequent reapplication for or\nredetermination of eligibility, regains eligibility within the restriction\nperiod will be eligible for benefits only in accordance with the restriction\npreviously imposed.)\n(i) Rereview for compliance with restriction. The department will monitor the\nrecipient's compliance with a restriction and determine whether an additional\nrestriction period is appropriate. The department will use evidence of MA\nidentification card alterations, services received inappropriately from\nnon-primary providers and other improper actions as the basis for an additional\nadministrative restriction for other than medical reasons. A decision not to\ncontinue a restriction will in no way preclude any subsequent decisions to\nrestrict for medical reasons. A recipient restricted for an additional period\nfor non-compliance will have the same rights and is entitled to all appropriate\nnotices informing him/her of the proposed action. These rights and notices are\nspecified in Part 358 of this Title and subdivision (e) of this\nsection. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
