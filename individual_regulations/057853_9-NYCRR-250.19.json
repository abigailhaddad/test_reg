Tit. 9 § 250.19 - Procedure for agency noncentralized printing purchases\n\nState Regulations\n\nAgency printing requirements which cannot be fulfilled\nunder a centralized contract let by the commissioner, may only be directly\npurchased by the agency in compliance with the following procedures and\nmonetary limitations: (a) Agency\npurchases not exceeding $1,000. An agency may purchase such items of printing\ndirectly from a responsible vendor of its choice, with no prior or subsequent\napproval from the commissioner. While no competitive bidding is required, agencies should take steps necessary to ensure that prices are reasonable and a\nwritten confirmation of the successful vendor's quotation showing the time and\nconditions of sale should be obtained. The Comptroller's copy of the issued\npurchase order shall be processed in accordance with the Comptroller's then\ncurrent procedural requirements. (b) Agency purchases in excess of $1,000, but\nnot exceeding $5,000. The advance approval of the commissioner for such\npurchases must be obtained through submission of a purchase request to the\n\nOffice of General Services. The commissioner may elect to contract for the item\nor authorize the purchase by the agency. If direct purchase by the requesting\nagency is authorized, the agency may purchase such printing, without subsequent\napproval by the commissioner in the following manner only: (1)\nA minimum of five bids should be\nsolicited from responsible vendors and each vendor solicited shall receive a\ncopy of the bid documents, which documents shall include by reference, the\ngeneral conditions issued by OGS.

(2)\n\nAll sealed\nbids received shall be opened publicly at the time and place of bid\nopening. (3)\nA tabulation of all\nbids received at the bid opening shall be prepared, setting forth the identity\nof each bidder, the prices quoted and all other pertinent information. Bids\nshall be tabulated by item number and unit price in such form as to afford a\nbasis for strict comparison of the prices bid. In addition to the foregoing, the agency shall supply a listing of all vendors from whom bids were solicited. Bids received subsequent to the time noticed for the bid opening shall be\nrejected and returned to the bidder, except that such late bids may be\nconsidered where either no bids or no acceptable bids have been timely\nreceived. (4)\n\nIf the low bidder is\nsuccessful, all papers are to be retained in the agency file and the original\ncopy of the order should be forwarded to the vendor. The Audit and Control copy\nof the order should at the same time, be forwarded to the Comptroller's office\nalong with a certified copy of the bid tabulation. (5)\n\nIf a low bid(s) is being rejected, a\nmemorandum should be prepared stating in detail the reasons for rejection, and\na certified copy of the bid tabulation, the successful vendor's quotation, any\nrejected vendor's quotation, the rejection memorandum, together with all copies\nof the purchase order made out to the lowest responsible bidder meeting\nspecifications, shall be forwarded to the Department of Audit and\n\nControl. (c) Agency\npurchases in excess of $5,000. Advance approval of the commissioner must be\nobtained through submission of a purchase request to the Office of General\n\nServices. (1)\n\nIf purchase by the requesting\nagency is approved, the agency shall solicit, open and tabulate bids in the\nsame manner as provided in paragraphs (b)(1), (2), (3) of this section for\npurchases in excess of $1,000 but not exceeding $2,500. The agency shall\nforward to the commissioner all bids, documents, correspondence and other\npertinent information, two copies of each of the certified tabulation, and bid\nrejection memorandum(s), if any, as well as all copies of the issued purchase\norder made out to the lowest responsible bidder meeting\nspecifications. (2)\n\nIf the\ncommissioner approves the proposed purchase order, he will forward the\nappropriate documentation to Audit and Control, and/or the agency with his\napproval indicated thereon. The form and routing of this documentation will\nreflect the most current Audit and Control legal and procedural requirements. If the commissioner disapproves the proposed purchase order, he will advise the\nagency accordingly. (d) Multiple purchases of identical items of printing made by an agency within any\n60-day period shall be considered a single purchase for the purpose of this\nsection, and the aggregate cost of such purchases shall determine the method of\npurchase in accordance with this section.
