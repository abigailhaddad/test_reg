  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 2051.2 - Procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Invoices. In\norder to initiate any payment pursuant to a contract, a contractor shall be\nrequired to submit a proper invoice to the corporation, except where the\ncontract provides that the contractor will be paid at predetermined intervals\nwithout having to submit an invoice for each scheduled payment. A proper\ninvoice shall contain a written request for contract payment and shall set\nforth the description, price and quantity of goods or services delivered or\nrendered, in such form and supported by such other substantiating documentation\nas the corporation may reasonably require. For purposes of these regulations, receipt of an invoice means (1) the date on which a proper invoice is actually\nreceived by the corporation, or (2) the date on which the corporation receives\nthe purchased goods, property or services covered by the proper invoice, whichever is later. (b) Schedule of\npayment. (1)\n\nThe corporation shall make\npayment under a contract within 45 calendar days after receipt of an invoice\nfor the amount of the payment then due, for each invoice received prior to July\n1, 1989. For each invoice received on or after July 1, 1989, the corporation\nshall make payment within 30 calendar days (excluding legal holidays) after\nreceipt of such invoice for the amount of the payment then due. Where the\ncontract provides that the contractor will be paid at predetermined intervals\nwithout having to submit an invoice for each scheduled payment, payments shall\nbe made by the payment due dates specified in accordance with the\ncontract. (2)\n\nThe corporation shall\nhave 15 calendar days after receipt of an invoice to notify the contractor of: (i) defects in the delivered goods or\nservices; (ii)\ndefects in the\ninvoice; or\n(iii)\nsuspected\nimproprieties of any kind. The existence of any such defect or impropriety shall prevent\nthe commencement of the 45- or 30-day periods specified in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision, provided that the corporation notifies the contractor of the\nexistence of any such defect or impropriety within 15 calendar days of receipt\nof the invoice. If such notification is not given within 15 days, the number of\ndays allowed for payment once the defect or impropriety is cured will be\nreduced by the number of days between the 15th day and the day notification was\ngiven.
