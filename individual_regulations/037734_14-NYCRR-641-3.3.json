  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 §§ 641-3.3 - Increases for Eligible Rate Based Programs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) January 1, 2015 Increase. Rates for\n\nEligible Rate Based Programs will be revised to incorporate funding for\ncompensation increases to direct support professional employees. Such rate\nincreases will be effective January 1, 2015. The compensation increase funding\nwill be included in the provider's rate issued for January 1, 2015 or in a\nsubsequent rate with the inclusion of funding in the amount necessary to\nachieve the same funding impact as if the rate had been issued on January 1, 2015. The compensation increase funding will be inclusive of associated fringe\nbenefits. (b) April 1, 2015\n\nIncrease. In addition to the compensation funding effective January 1, 2015, providers that operate supervised IRAs, including supervised community\nresidences, supportive IRAs, including supportive community residences, ICFs/DD\nor group day habilitation will receive a compensation increase targeted to\ndirect support professional and clinical employees to be effective April 1, 2015. The compensation increase funding will be inclusive of associated fringe\nbenefits. The April 1, 2015 direct support professional compensation funding\nwill be the same, on an annualized basis, as that which was calculated for the\n\nJanuary 1, 2015 compensation increase and will be an augmentation to the\n\nJanuary 1, 2015 increase. (c) Calculations. The basis for the calculation of provider and regional direct\ncare, support and clinical salary averages and associated fringe benefit\npercentages will be the data in providers' July 1, 2010 - June 30, 2011 or\n\nJanuary 1, 2011 - December 31, 20\n11 CFR\ns. (1)\n\nThe January 1, 2015 and April 1, 2015 Direct Support Professionals compensation\nincrease funding formula will be as follows: (i) The annual impact of a two percent\nincrease to 2010-11 or 2011 salaried direct care, salaried support dollars and\nassociated fringe benefits will be calculated. (ii)\n\nThe annual impact of the two percent\nincrease for salaried direct care dollars, salaried support dollars and\nassociated fringe will be added to the appropriate operating components in the\nrate methodology. This will result in a recalculation of provider and regional\naverage direct care wages, provider and regional average employee-related\ncomponents, provider and regional average program support components, and\nprovider and regional average direct care hourly rates. (iii)\n\nThe provider direct care hourly rate -\nadjusted for a wage equalization factor will be recalculated to utilize the\nprovider average direct care hourly rate and regional average direct care\nhourly rate (as calculated in (ii) above). (iv)\n\nAn identification will be made of the\ndollar difference between the provider direct care hourly rate - adjusted for a\nwage equalization factor, which is in the rate in effect on 12/31/2014, and the\nprovider direct care hourly rate- adjusted for a wage equalization factor, as\ncalculated in (iii) above. (v) The\nrate difference identified in (iv) above will be multiplied by the calculated\ndirect care hours in the rate in effect on 12/31/2014 to calculate the\nadditional funding generated by the direct care compensation adjustment. (vi)\n\nThe rate add-on for the\ncompensation increase shall be determined by dividing the additional funding, as calculated in (v) above by the rate sheet units in effect on January 1, 2015. (2)\n\nThe April 1, 2015 Clinical compensation increase funding formula will be as follows: (i) The annual impact of a two percent\nincrease to 2010-11 or 2011 salaried clinical dollars and associated fringe\nbenefits will be calculated. (ii)\n\nThe annual impact of the two percent increase for salaried clinical dollars and\nassociated fringe will be added to the appropriate operating components in the\nrate methodology. This will result in a recalculation of provider and regional\naverage employee-related compo- nents, and provider and regional average\nclinical hourly wages. (iii)\n\nThe\nprovider clinical hourly wage - adjusted for a wage equalization factor will be\nrecalculated to utilize the provider average clinical hourly wage and the\nregional average clinical hourly wage (as calculated in (ii) above). (iv)\n\nAn identification will be made of the\ndollar difference between the provider clinical hourly wage - adjusted for a\nwage equalization fac- tor, which is in the rate in effect on 12/31/2014, and\nthe provider clinical hourly wage- adjusted for a wage equalization factor, as\ncalculated in (iii) above. (v) The\nrate difference identified in (iv) above will be multiplied by the provider\nsalaried clinical hours in the rate in effect on 12/31/2014 to calculate the\nadditional funding generated by the clinical compensation adjustment. (vi)\n\nThe rate add on for the\ncompensation increase shall be determined by dividing the additional funding, as calculated in (v) above by the rate sheet units in effect on January 1, 2015. (3)\n\nRates for\nindividuals identified by OPWDD as qualifying for specialized template\npopulations funding shall be adjusted as follows: (i) January 1, 2015 Increase. The fees for\nspecialized template populations funding will be revised to incorporate funding\nfor compensation increases to direct support professional employees. Such fee\nincreases will be effective January 1, 2015. The compensation increase funding\nwill be included in the provider's fee issued for January 1, 2015 or in a\nsubsequent fee with the inclusion of funding in the amount necessary to achieve\nthe same funding impact as if the fee had been issued on January 1, 2015. The\ncompensation increase funding will be inclusive of associated fringe\nbenefits. (ii)\n\nApril 1, 2015\n\nIncrease. In addition to compensation funding effective January 1, 2015, the\nfees for specialized template population funding will revised to incorporate\nfunding for a compensation increase to direct support professional and clinical\nemployees to be effective April 1, 2015. The April 1, 2015 direct support\ncompensation funding will be the same, on an annualized basis, as that which\nwas calculated for the January 1, 2015 compensation increase and will be an\naugmentation to the January 1, 2015 increase. (iii)\n\nCalculations. (a) The portion of the fee that is identified\nas direct care and sup- port will be increased by 2% and multiplied by the fee\nsheet fringe benefit percentage to calculate the additional direct support\ncompensation increases for January first, two thousand fifteen and April first, two thousand fifteen. (b) The\nportion of the fee that is identified as clinical will be increased by 2% and\nmultiplied by the fee sheet fringe benefit percentage to calculate the\nadditional clinical compensation increase for April first, two thousand\nfifteen.
