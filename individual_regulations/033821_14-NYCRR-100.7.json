  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 100.7 - Review of certain decisions of local governmental units\n\nState Regulations\n\nMental Hygiene Law, § 11.13, subd. (e). (a) Introduction. Article 11 of the Mental Hygiene Law makes clear that the\npolicy of the State is that the local governmental unit shall be the operative\nagency for insuring that local services for the mentally disabled are provided. The units are charged with this responsibility for planning, supervising and\ncoordinating such local services. Local programs carried out pursuant to the\nlaw and to this Part which have been approved by the department are eligible\nfor State aid in accordance with the formulas set forth in the law. Voluntary\norganizations offering community services pursuant to contract with local\ngovernmental units have been recognized as an extremely important component of\nthe community services program. In approving the plan for each community, as\nsubmitted by its local governmental unit, the department makes every effort to\nsee that the local plan is well balanced and makes full use of community\nresources, including the use of voluntary organizations which have the\nexpertise and the resources to participate in community programs. Section\n11.13, subdivision (e) of the Mental Hygiene Law provides that a non-profit\nagency which has been refused a contract by a local governmental unit may\nappeal to the commissioner. If the commissioner upholds the appeal, the\ndepartment may enter into a direct contract with the agency. This Part sets\nforth the criteria and the procedures for appeal and decision under that\nsection. The policy of the department remains one of encouraging local\ngovernmental units to make full use of voluntary organizations where\nappropriate for the development of community programs, and to resolve\ndisagreement at the local level without the need for an appeal pursuant to this\nsection. (b) Right to\nappeal. (1)\nA corporation, incorporated\nor existing, pursuant to the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law, which has the\npower to provide community mental health, mental retardation, or alcoholism\nservices may appeal to the commissioner within 30 days from the date that such\nappellant has been notified of the refusal by the local governmental unit to\nenter into a contract with such appellant or within 30 days after the unit's\nfailure to include such a contract in its plan or budget. (2)\n\nAn appeal may be had only where the\napplication for a contract to the local governmental unit by the appellant does\nnot involve the direct expenditure of local tax money. (c) Written appeal and reply. (1)\n\nAn appeal to the commissioner pursuant to\nthis section, must be in writing with a copy to the local governmental unit and\nto the appropriate regional office of the department. The written appeal must\nset forth facts showing the following: (i) The\ndetails of the program which the appellant has offered in its proposed\ncontract. (ii)\n\nThe need for the\nprogram in the community. (iii)\nA\nshowing that the appellant has the capacity to furnish the services. Specific\ndetail must be shown that the appellant would be able to provide the place, the\npersonnel and the organizational structure to effectuate the proposed program\nand that it has such licenses or approvals as are needed to operate such a\nprogram. The appellant must also show that it has the financial ability to\nprovide sufficient funds to match State aid. (iv)\n\nThe appellant must show that it has made\na concrete offer in writing with specific proposals to the local government\nwithin the time possible for inclusion of the item in the local plan and\nbudget. (v) A copy of the decision\nof local government to refuse to enter into the agreement or sufficient facts\nto show that there has been a definite decision to that effect must be\nsubmitted. (2)\n\nThe\ndepartment will notify the local governmental unit of the appeal and will give\nthe unit 30 days to make its reply to the appeal. In its reply, the unit shall\nset forth facts showing whether there was a substantial basis for its decision. The unit shall serve a copy of its reply, personally or by mail, upon the\nappellant. (d) Conciliation. Every effort shall be made by the department to conciliate\nthe appellant and the unit. Informal sessions may be arranged for a discussion\nof the issues and an attempt to resolve the appeal without further formal\nprocedure. (e) Disposition without hearing. If the appellant has failed to set forth in its written\nappeal a substantial basis for consideration of the matter by the commissioner, or if, on the basis of the facts appearing on the papers presented to the\ncommissioner, there appears no substantial basis for appeal, the commissioner\nshall dismiss the appeal. (f) Hearing. (1)\n\nIf a substantial basis for appeal has\nbeen presented by the appellant, and the efforts of the department at\nconciliation have failed, a hearing shall be held before the commissioner or\nsomeone designated by him at a time or times fixed by the commissioner. Written\nnotice of the hearing shall be given to the appellant, the local governmental\nunit and such other persons as the commissioner may deem advisable. (2)\n\nThe hearing shall not be adjudicatory in\nnature and the rules applying to quasi-judicial hearings shall not apply. The\nappellant, the representatives of the local governmental unit, appropriate\nstaff members of the department and other interested individuals may present\ntheir views to the commissioner on the merits of the appeal. (3)\n\nWhenever possible, the commissioner shall\ndesignate a place in the county seat of the county from which the appeal has\narisen for the conduct of the hearing. (g) Decision. (1)\n\nWithin 20 days after the date that the\nhearing has closed, a decision shall be made by the commissioner on whether the\nappeal is meritorious. (2)\n\nThe\ncommissioner shall notify the local governmental unit and the appellant of his\ndecision. If the decision holds that the appeal is meritorious, the notice\nshall require that the local governmental unit give further consideration to\nthe appellant's request and notify the commissioner within 20 days as to\nwhether or not the unit has reconsidered its refusal. (3)\n\nIf a local governmental unit notifies the\ncommissioner that it is willing to grant the contract requested by the\nappellant, the commissioner shall close the matter. (4)\n\nIf the local governmental unit notifies\nthe commissioner that it is not willing to reconsider its refusal or if such\nunit fails to reply within the time specified, the commissioner may then decide\nwhether to grant a contract directly with the appellant. A decision to grant a\ncontract shall be within the sole discretion of the commissioner and shall be\nbased on his judgment on the desirability of the program and the availability\nof funds for this purpose. In every case where the appeal has been found\nmeritorious, regardless of whether or not a direct contract is granted, the\ncommissioner shall direct a review of the adequacy of the local plan for\ncommunity services for the mentally disabled. (5)\n\nDirect contracts with agencies shall only\nbe made under the following conditions: (i) Contracts may only be made within existing appropriations. (ii)\n\nThe department shall not pay more than\nthe percentage of the net cost of the services that the appellant would have\nreceived if the contract had been granted by the local governmental\nunit. (iii)\n\nThe term of any\ncontract shall be limited to one year. (iv)\n\nFurther contracts will only be made\ndirectly with the appellant upon a showing by the appellant that it has\nsubmitted its proposal for future fiscal years to the local governmental unit\nand that such unit has continued to refuse to enter into a contract. (v) Such other conditions as the commissioner\nmay direct to insure that the service is adequate and suitable and\nappropriately related to other elements of the local plan. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
