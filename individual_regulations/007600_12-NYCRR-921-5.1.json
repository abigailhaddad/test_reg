  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 921-5.1 - Temporary employment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Notice is not required if the closing or layoff results from the completion of\na particular project or undertaking, and the affected employees were hired with\nthe understanding that their employment was limited to the duration of the\nproject or undertaking. (b) The\nemployer must demonstrate that it informed each employee at the time of hire\nthat the job was temporary. For purposes of this Part, \"at will\" employment is\nnot \"temporary\" employment and providing notification to employees, at the time\nof hire or otherwise, that their employment is at will and subject to\ntermination at any time by the employer shall not constitute notice that\nemployment is of limited duration. (c) Employment in an industry that\ntraditionally hires temporary employees does not, in and of itself, make an\nemployee temporary if the employee was hired to perform a variety of jobs and\ntasks continuously through most of the calendar year. Giving written notice\nthat a project is temporary with the intent of converting permanent employment\ninto temporary work so as to avoid the requirement of notice shall be a\nviolation of the Act and this Part.
