  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 175.5 - Minimum instructional hours and use of superintendents' conference days for State aid purposes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Purpose. The provisions of this section are intended to provide school\ndistricts and boards of cooperative educational services (BOCES) with\nflexibility in meeting the 180-day requirement in order to receive State aid\npursuant to sections\n1704\n(2)\nand\n3604\n(7)\nof the Education Law for actual\ninstructional time provided to students. Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued to preclude school districts and BOCES from lengthening the school\nday and/or school year beyond the annual minimum instructional requirement for\nboth instructional and non-instructional activities, including but not limited\nto, homeroom periods, lunch, recess, staff development activities, parent-teacher conferences, or any other purpose the school district or BOCES\nhas determined is necessary for the development of the whole child and/or to\nimprove student achievement. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\"Instructional hours'' shall\nmean an hour or a fraction of an hour, during which students are receiving\ninstruction from a certified teacher pursuant to Part 80 of this Title in an\nacademic subject and/or periods of time during which students are engaged in\nsupervised study activities, including completing homework and/or the review of\nhomework. Instructional hours shall not include periods of time where\ninstruction and/or supervised study time is not provided to students, such as\nlunch or recess. (2)\n\"Session day''\nshall mean a day when school is held and instruction is provided to students. This may be any day, excluding Saturdays and legal holidays pursuant to\n\nEducation Law § 3604(8), from the first day in which attendance may be required\npursuant to Education Law § 3205(1)(c) until the end of the school year, plus\nsuperintendents' conference days. (c) Annual Hourly Requirement. Commencing\nwith the 2018-20 19 school year, for the purpose of apportionment of State aid, any school district or BOCES must be in session for at least 180 school days, and during such 180 days the school district and BOCES must meet the following\nminimum annual instructional requirement: (1)\n\nFor pupils in half-day kindergarten, a minimum of 450 instructional\nhours. (2)\n\nFor pupils in full-day\nkindergarten and grades one through six, a minimum of 900 instructional\nhours. (3)\n\nFor pupils in grades\nseven through twelve, a minimum of 99 0 instructional\nhours. (d) School\ncalendar development. To ensure that school districts and BOCES meet the annual\ninstructional requirement in order to receive State aid, it is recommended that\nschool districts and BOCES establish school year calendars that exceed the\nminimum requirements as provided herein by at least the average number of\nemergency days that such district or BOCES has taken over the previous five\nschool years. (e) Emergency\nconditions. (1)\n\nRemote instruction due to\nemergency conditions. If a school district would otherwise close due to an\nemergency, including but not limited to, extraordinary adverse weather\nconditions, impairment of heating facilities, insufficiency of water supply, shortage of fuel, destruction of a school building, or a communicable disease\noutbreak, the school district may remain in session and provide remote\ninstruction, as defined in section\n100.1\n(u) of this\n\nChapter, and beginning with the 2023-2024 school year such remote instruction\nshall be consistent with such school district's emergency remote instruction\nplan pursuant to section\n155.17\n(c)(1)(xxi)\nof this Chapter. Instruction provided on these session days may be counted\ntowards the annual hour requirement set forth in subdivision (c) of this\nsection. The superintendent shall certify to the Department, on a form\nprescribed by the Commissioner, that an emergency condition existed on a\npreviously scheduled session day and that such school district was in session\nand provided remote instruction on that day and indicate how many instructional\nhours were provided on such session day and, beginning with the 2023-2024\nschool year, certify that remote instruction was provided in accordance with\nthe district's emergency remote instruction plan. (2)\n\nUnscheduled school delays and early\nreleases. Instructional hours that a school district scheduled but did not\nexecute, either because of a delay to the start of a school day or an early\nrelease, due to extraordinarily adverse weather conditions, impairment of\nheating facilities, insufficiency of water supply, shortage of fuel, destruction of a school building, or such other cause as may be found\nsatisfactory by the Commissioner, may still be considered as instructional\nhours for State aid purposes for up to two instructional hours per session day, provided, however, that the superintendent shall certify to the Department, on\na form prescribed by the Commissioner, that an extraordinary condition existed\non a previously scheduled session day and that school was in session on that\nday. (f) Double or\noverlapping sessions. The provisions of subdivision (c) of this section shall\nnot apply to schools which operate on double or overlapping sessions, provided\nthe written approval of the commissioner to operate such sessions has been\nobtained prior to the scheduling of such sessions for any school\nyear. (g) The provisions of\nsubdivision (c) of this section shall not apply where the prior written\napproval of the commissioner has been obtained to conduct, in a given school\nyear, an experimental or alternative program involving daily sessions\nconsisting of fewer hours than would otherwise be required by the provisions of\nsubdivision (c) of his section. (h) Use of superintendents' conferences. (1)\n\nSuperintendents' conferences to provide staff development activities that are\nrelated to implementation of the new high learning standards and assessments, general staff orientation, curriculum development, or in service education may\nbe credited toward the annual instructional requirement set forth in\nsubdivision (c) of this section as follows: (i) 10 hours for half-day\nkindergarten; (ii)\n20 hours for\nfull-day kindergarten and grades one through six, and\n(iii)\n22 hours for grades seven through\ntwelve. Provided, however, that (A) two and one-half hours for half- day\nkindergarten, (B) five hours for full-day kindergarten and grades one through\nsix, or (C) five and one-half hours for grades seven through twelve shall be\nconsidered one superintendents' conference day authorized pursuant to section\n3604\n(8)\nof the Education Law, and provided that\nsuch conferences occur on days when the regular day schools of the school\ndistrict may legally be in session, and provided further that such conference\ndays may not be scheduled for routine school administrative matters such as the\ngrading of assignments, the preparation of pupil assignments, record-keeping, or the preparation of lesson plans. Such superintendents' conferences, in hours\ntotaling two superintendent conference days authorized pursuant to section\n3604\n(8)\nof the Education Law, may be held, if the\nschool district so elects, in the last two weeks of August, subject to\ncollective bargaining requirements pursuant to article fourteen of the civil\nservice law. (i) Regents examinations and other\nassessments. (1)\n\nRegents examinations. For\nonly the grade levels sitting for a Regents examination, a district may\nschedule the average number of instructional hours it provides on\nnon-examination days for days on which Regents examinations or Rating Day are\nheld, and have such hours count toward the annual minimum hourly requirement. On such days, attendance need not be taken, and attendance may not be assumed\nand claimed for State Aid purposes under any circumstances. If grades seven\nthrough twelve are housed in the same building, school district officials may\nexcuse the students from any grade level for which an examination is not being\noffered if their class schedules are disrupted by the Regents examination\nschedule and if staff are needed to properly administer such\nexaminations. (2)\n\nNew York State\n\nAssessments. Session days during which New York State Assessments, including\nbut not limited to the Grades 3-8 English language arts and mathematics\nassessments, are administered are days on which attendance must be taken and\nwhich instructional hours count toward the annual minimum hourly\nrequirement. (3)\n\nOther state\nassessments. On session days during which alternative and/or pathway\nassessments, as defined in section\n100.2\n(f) and (mm)\nof this Title, are administered, attendance must be taken an d only actual\ninstructional hours for pupils in attendance, including the examination time, may be included within the instructional hour requirement. Grade levels that\nare excused from instruction on those days may not have hours count toward the\nrequirement. (4)\n\nOther examinations\nand assessments. Time spent on session days where other assessments are\nadministered may count toward the annual minimum instructional hour requirement\nprovided such assessments are administered by a certified teacher, attendance\nis taken, and students not sitting for such assessments receive instruction\nduring such time. Grade levels that are excused from instruction on such days\nmay not have this time count toward the requirement. (j) Short session aid deduction. For the\npurposes of reducing State Aid pursuant to section\n3604\n(7)\nof the Education Law, one day shall mean: (1)\n\nFor pupils in half-day kindergarten, two\nand one-half hours. (2)\n\nFor pupils\nin full-day kindergarten and grades one through six, five hours. (3)\n\nFor pupils in grades seven through\ntwelve, five and one-half hours. In the event that a school district or BOCES\nhas a total deficiency in hours that equals a fraction of hours per day\npursuant to this paragraph, such deficiency shall be rounded up to the next\nwhole day.
