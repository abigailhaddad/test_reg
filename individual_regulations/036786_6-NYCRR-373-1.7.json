  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-1.7 - Permit modifications\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Transfer of permits. (1)\nA\npermit may be transferred by the permittee to a new owner or operator only if\nthe permit has been modified under subdivision (b) of this section and Part 621\nof this Title to identify the new permittee and incorporate such other\nrequirements as may be necessary. (2)\n\nChanges in the ownership or operational\ncontrol of a facility may be made as a minor modification with prior written\napproval of the commissioner in accordance with subdivision (c) of this\nsection. The new owner or operator must submit a revised permit application no\nlater than 90 days prior to the scheduled change. A written agreement\ncontaining a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility between the\ncurrent and new permittees must also be submitted to the commissioner. When a\ntransfer of ownership or operational control occurs, the previous owner or\noperator shall comply with the requirements of section\n373-2.8\n(Financial requirements) of\nthis Part until the new owner or operator has demonstrated that he or she is\ncomplying with the requirements of that section. The new owner or operator must\ndemonstrate compliance with section\n373-2.8\nrequirements within six\nmonths of the date of the change of ownership or operational control of the\nfacility. Upon demonstration to the commissioner by the new owner of compliance\nwith section\n373-2.8, the commissioner shall\nnotify the previous owner or operator that he or she no longer needs to comply\nwith section\n373-2.8\nas of the date of\ndemonstration. (b) Modification of permits. Every application for modifications to a permit will be\nprocessed pursuant to Part 621 of this Title. (c) Minor modification of\nRCRA-delegated permits. An application for modification of an RCRA-delegated\npermit may be processed pursuant to Part 621 of this Title without being\ntreated as a new application for only the following changes under the indicated\ncategories: (1)\n\nGeneral permit\nprovisions.
