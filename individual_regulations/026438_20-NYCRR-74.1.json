Tit. 20 § 74.1 - Imposition of tax on the possession of cigarettes for sale\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 4, 471 and 475\n(a) (1)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided for in this section, all cigarettes possessed in\n\nNew York State by any person for sale in the State are subject to the tax\nimposed by article 20 of the Tax Law. It shall be presumed that all cigarettes\nwithin the State are subject to tax until the contrary is established. The\nburden of proof that any cigarettes are not so subject to tax will be upon the\nperson or persons in possession of such cigarettes. (2)\n\nThe tax on the possession of cigarettes\nfor sale is imposed at the rate of $4.35 for each 20 cigarettes or fraction\nthereof. If a package of cigarettes contains more than 20 cigarettes, the rate\nof tax on those cigarettes in excess of 20 is $1.0875 for each five cigarettes\nor fraction thereof. (b) (1)\n\nIt is the intent of article 20 of the Tax\n\nLaw that the ultimate incidence of and liability for the cigarette tax is upon\nthe consumer of cigarettes and that such tax will ultimately be collected from\nthe consumer. Though borne by the consumer, the cigarette tax shall be advanced\nand paid by licensed cigarette agents. An agent will be liable for the\ncollection and payment of the tax on the possession of cigarettes for sale\nwithin the State and shall pay the tax to the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance by purchasing stamps, as defined in subdivision (b) of section\n70.2\nof\nthis Title, from a fiscal agent or agent bank duly authorized to sell such\nstamps on the department's behalf. The amount of the cigarette tax, evidenced\nby the affixation and cancellation of cigarette tax stamps on individual\npackages of cigarettes, shall be added to and collected as part of the agent's\nsales price of the cigarettes to subsequent dealers or the consumer. (2)\n(i) Every dealer of cigarettes receiving stamped packages of cigarettes in New York\n\nState shall advance and pay the cigarette tax as part of such dealer's purchase\nprice and shall pass the tax through to subsequent purchasers. (ii)\n\nIf payment of the tax is not evidenced\nby the presence of a proper cigarette tax stamp, such cigarettes are presumed\ntaxable and any dealer (other than an agent) or consumer in possession thereof\nmay be held liable for the cigarette tax. A dealer of cigarettes, other than an\nagent, shall be precluded from purchasing and affixing cigarette stamps and, unless specifically provided for in this Title, from possessing, selling or\ndistributing, in any manner whatsoever, unstamped packages of\ncigarettes. (3)\n\nIn no\nevent shall the cigarette tax be paid to the department more than once on the\nsame package of cigarettes. (c) In general and as provided for in this\n\nTitle, no tax will be imposed under article 20 of the Tax Law on cigarettes\nsold: (1)\nunder any circumstances that the\n\nState of New York is without power to impose the tax; (2)\nto or by the United States or a voluntary\nunincorporated organization of the United States Armed Forces that is operating\na place for the sale of goods pursuant to regulations promulgated by the\nappropriate executive agency of the United States; (3)\nto the State of New York; (4)\nto out-of-state purchasers; or\n(5)\nto the United Nations. See Part 76 of this Title for exemptions from tax. See\nalso, section\n74.3\nof this Part for nontaxable sales of cigarettes exclusively to licensed agents\nby persons introducing cigarettes into the New York State\nmarket. (d) The\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance is authorized to enter into agreements with\nany city of the State which imposes a tax which is similar to that imposed by\narticle 20 of the Tax Law to provide for the joint administration, in whole or\nin part, of such taxes. The department has entered into such an agreement with\nthe City of New York for the partial administration of the city tax on\ncigarettes imposed by chapter 13 of title 11 of the Administrative Code of the\n\nCity of New York, and in this respect has prescribed joint stamps for payment\nof both the State and city liabilities.
