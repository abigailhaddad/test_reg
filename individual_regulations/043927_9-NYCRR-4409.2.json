  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4409.2 - Determination of surtax\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe surcharge plus the breaks will not be deducted from\nany pool if to do so would result in a payoff basis of less than $2.10 for a $2\nwager. Thus, where a payout is greater than $2.10 but would be reduced to less\nthan $2.10 upon deduction of the full surcharge, a surcharge will be imposed\nand deducted only insofar as such surcharge will allow a minimum payoff of\n$2.10 for each $2 wager. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4409.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
