Tit. 4 § 21.6 - Personal leave\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Personal\nleave is leave with pay for personal business, including religious observance, without charge against accumulated vacation or overtime credits. Employees\nshall be entitled to personal leave not exceeding a total of five days in a\nyear, to be credited as follows: (1)\n\nAn\nemployee in State service on the effective date of this Chapter shall be\ncredited with five days' personal leave on the effective date of this Chapter, and thereafter, except as herein otherwise provided, shall be credited with\nfive days' personal leave each year on the anniversary of the effective date of\nthis Chapter. (2)\n\nAny person who\nwas separated or granted a leave of absence without pay from State service\nprior to the effective date of this Chapter and is hereafter reemployed or\nreinstated in State service, and any employee who enters State service after\nthe effective date of this Chapter, shall be credited with five days' personal\nleave on the date of such reemployment, reinstatement or entry, as the case may\nbe, and thereafter, except as herein otherwise provided, shall be credited with\nfive days' personal leave each year on the anniversary of such date, and, for\nthe purpose of crediting personal leave, a per diem or hourly paid employee\nshall be deemed to enter State service on the date on which he becomes subject\nto the application of this Chapter. (3)\n\nIf an employee is separated from State\nservice, or granted a leave of absence without pay from State service, subsequent to the effective date of this Chapter, and thereafter is reinstated\nor reemployed within one year following the last date upon which personal leave\nwas credited to him pursuant to this Chapter, the unused personal leave\nstanding to his credit at the time of separation or leave of absence shall be\nrestored to him and he shall retain the same anniversary date for the purposes\nof crediting personal leave thereafter under this section as that which was\napplicable to him prior to such separation or leave of absence. (4)\n\nIf an employee is separated from State\nservice, or granted a leave of absence without pay from State service, subsequent to the effective date of this Chapter, and thereafter is reinstated\nor reemployed more than one year following the last date upon which personal\nleave was credited to him pursuant to this Part, such reinstatement or\nreemployment shall be deemed to be a new entry into State service for the\npurposes of crediting personal leave under this Part. (5)\n\nIf an employee is appointed, promoted or\ntransferred to another department or agency, the unused personal leave standing\nto his credit at the time of such appointment, promotion or transfer shall be\ntransferred with him, and he shall retain the same anniversary date for\npurposes of crediting personal leave as that which was applicable to him prior\nto such appointment, promotion or transfer. (b) Personal leave shall not be cumulative, and any personal leave credit remaining unused by an employee on the date\nimmediately preceding the anniversary date upon which he is entitled to receive\nnew personal leave credits hereunder shall be cancelled. Unused personal leave\nshall not be liquidated in cash at the time of separation, retirement or\ndeath. (c) Personal leave may be\ndrawn only at a time convenient to and approved in advance by the appointing\nauthority; provided, however, that personal leave allowed for religious\nobservance shall be granted on the days and hours required, insofar as the same\nmay be granted at such time without interference with the proper conduct of\ngovernmental functions.
