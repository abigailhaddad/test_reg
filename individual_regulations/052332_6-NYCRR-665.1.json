  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 665.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) It is the\npublic policy of the State, as reflected in the provisions of the Freshwater\n\nWetlands Act, to provide the opportunity for local protection of freshwater\nwetlands and the benefits derived from them and to provide the opportunity for\nlocal regulation of the use and development of such wetlands to secure those\nbenefits. It is the purpose of this Part to implement that policy by\nestablishing regulations that: (1)\ndefine the\nprocedural requirements for the assumption of local regulatory\nauthority; (2)\ndefine the\nprocedural requirements for the review and issuance of permits by a local\ngovernment; (3)\nestablish standards\nand criteria for local government performance; and\n(4)\ndefine the relationships between a local\ngovernment and other jurisdictions. (b) The option to assume regulatory authority\nis voluntary. A local government's decision to not assume regulatory authority\npursuant to this Part and the act does not diminish or affect that local\ngovernment's ability or authority to establish its own land-use controls for\nfreshwater wetlands within its jurisdiction.
