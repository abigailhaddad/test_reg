  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 674.4 - Hearing participation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Participation in the hearing may be limited or as a party. Limited\nparticipation means the presentation of a statement. Party status involves the\npresentation of a statement, sponsoring of witnesses and the questioning of the\nwitnesses of other parties. (b) To\nobtain party status a person must file, in writing and by the date set in the\nnotice of hearing, a statement of position which identifies the nature of the\nargument, evidence, and witnesses which the person intends to present, and any\nother matter believed relevant. (c) If a sufficient filing is not made, the ALJ has discretion to limit\nparticipation or require additional information from the filer. The ALJ may\nalso limit the participation of a party to those areas in which his expertise\nwould prove beneficial to the development of a factual record. (d) The ALJ may allow any person meeting the\nrequirements of subdivision (b) of this section to participate at any time\nduring the hearing if it is shown that good cause exists for failure to file on\ntime, that no other person will be unreasonably disadvantaged or otherwise\nprejudiced and that the person's participation will materially contribute to a\ncomplete record. (e) There shall be\nno appeals from the decisions of the ALJ with respect to party status or the\nextent of participation by any person or party. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n674.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
