  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 890.92 - Removal of home wiring\n\nState Regulations\n\nUpon voluntary termination of cable service by a\nsubscriber, a cable television company shall not remove cable home wiring in\nwhich it claims ownership unless it gives the subscriber the opportunity to\nacquire the wiring at the replacement cost, and the subscriber declines. The\ncost is to be determined based on the replacement cost per foot of the home\nwiring multiplied by the length in feet of such wiring. If the subscriber\ndeclines to acquire the cable home wiring, the cable television company must\nthen remove it within seven days or make no subsequent attempt to remove it or\nto restrict its use. Every cable television company shall provide notice to\nsubscribers of the provisions of this section in accordance with section\n890.80\n(j) of this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n890.92\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
