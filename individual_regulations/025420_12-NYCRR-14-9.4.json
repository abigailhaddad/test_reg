  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.4 - Safety valve requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each boiler shall have at least one safety valve and if it has more than 500\nsquare feet of bare tube water heating surface, or if an electric boiler has a\npower input more than 1,100 kw, it shall have two or more safety valves or\nsafety relief valves. For a boiler with combined bare tube and extended\nwater-heating surface exceeding 500 square feet, two or more safety valves or\nsafety relief valves are required only if the design steam generating capacity\nof the boiler exceeds 4000 lb/hr. The method of computing the steam-generating\ncapacity of the boiler is given as follows: The maximum quantity of fuel C that can be burned per\nhour at the time of maximum forcing is determined by a test. The maximum number\nof heat units per hour, or CH, is then determined, using the values of H given\nin the Table below. The weight of steam generated per hour is found by the\nformula: W =\nC ×\nH\n/\n1100\n× 0.75\nwhere\nW = weight of steam generated/hr, lb\nC = total weight or volume of fuel burned/hr at time of\nmaximum forcing, lb or cu ft\nH = heat of combustion of fuel, Btu/lb or Btu/cu ft\n(See Table below)\n\nThe sum ot the safety valve capacities marked on the\nvalves shall be equal to or greater than W. For the purpose of checking the safety valve capacity, the following values of heats of combustion of various fuels may be\nused: H = Btu/lb\n\nSemibituminous coal....... 14,500\n\nAnthracite....... 13,700\n\nScreenings....... 12,500\n\nCoke....... 13,500\n\nWood, hard or soft, kiln dried....... 7,700\n\nWood, hard or soft, air dried....... 6,200\n\nWood shavings....... 6,400\n\nPeat, air dried, 25% moisture....... 7,500\n\nLignite....... 10,000\n\nKerosene....... 20,000\n\nPetroleum, crude oil, Pennsylvania....... 20,700\n\nPetroleum, crude oil, Texas....... 18,500\n\nMunicipal solid waste....... 7,800\nH = Btu/cu ft\n\nNatural gas....... 960\n\nBlast-furnace gas....... 100\n\nProducer gas....... 150\n\nWater gas, uncarbureted....... 290\n(b) Organic fluid vaporizer generators\nrequire special consideration as given in the ASME Code. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
