Tit. 16 § 500.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All waterworks\ncorporations under the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission shall\ninstall approved meters and approved accessories, and before placing in\nservice, test all water meters used for the purpose of billing customers, and\nshall adjust the same so that the registration on the meter dial shall indicate\nthe quantity of water actually passing through the meter within the limits\nherein provided. However, meters and accessories placed in the field prior to\nthe effective date of the approval regulations will be grandfathered, based on\na review of the accuracy and reliability performance data supplied by\nwaterworks corporations as directed by commission staff. Such application must\nbe submitted within six months of the effective date of this section. (b) (1)\n\nNo\nwaterworks corporation furnishing metered water service shall allow a meter to\nremain in service for a period longer than that specified in the following\ntable without checking or testing said meter for accuracy and making the\nnecessary readjustments if found to be incorrect beyond the limits herein\nprovided. Size of meter\n\nInterval between\ntest\n5\n/\n8\n-inch, 3/4 -inch....... 15 years\n1-inch....... 5 years\n1 1/2 -inch, 2-inch....... 4 years\n3-inch....... 3 years\n4-inch....... 2 years\n6-inch and larger....... 1 year\n\nIn the case of new model water meters, the company shall\ntest a sample of the meters after they have been in service for five years. The\nsize of the sample shall be 10 percent of the total meters of that model in\nservice for five years or, alternatively, any percentage which the company can\ndemonstrate is statistically valid. When the test results have proven\nsatisfactory for three consecutive years, the sampling of these meters may be\ndiscontinued. (2)\n\nNor shall\nany meter be permitted to remain in service without similarly checking for\naccuracy and readjusting when its registration since the last test exceeds the\nfollowing: Size\n\nInterval between test\nregistration\n5\n/\n8\n-inch....... 1,500,000 gallons\n3/4 -inch, 1-inch....... 2,000,000 gallons\n1 1/2 -inch....... 3,000,000 gallons\n2-inch....... 7,000,000 gallons\nprovided, however, that such routine tests shall not be\nrequired more often than once a year. (c) All water meters in service on or after\n\nApril 1, 1932, for which there is no record of test within five years, shall be\ntested promptly thereafter, and in all cases within one year from said date; provided, however, that companies having over 5,000 meters will be allowed two\nyears; but at least one half of the meters shall be tested during the first\nyear. (d) A complete record shall\nbe kept by each waterworks corporation of all tests made by it to include: (1)\nowning or serving company's\nnumber; (2)\nmanufacturer's name and\nnumber; (3)\ntype and rated\ncapacity; (4)\ndate of installation, removal, and test; (5)\nreason for\ntest; (6)\nhistory of meter; to\ninclude date of purchase, various places of installation with dates of\ninstallation and removal and reason for such removal; and\n(7)\ndate of test; to include meter readings, measurement of water passed, method of measurement, location of test whether on\npremises of customer, in laboratory or shop or elsewhere, and any other\npertinent information. (e) On and after March 31, 1946, all\nwaterworks corporations shall make report of water meter tests on Revised Form\n\nNo. 2\n1\nand in accordance with the instructions\nattached thereto. (f) In order to\nfacilitate the testing of new or repaired meters, the commission may detail\ninspectors to make tests on the premises of water supply corporations or meter\nmanufacturers or at meter repair shops, provided such premises are maintained\nand equipped as hereinafter provided. (g) The name of the manufacturer and a serial\nnumber shall be plainly stamped on each meter. (h) Upon placing or replacing a meter in\nservice, unless the register is set at zero, the water company shall securely\nattach a tag stamped with figures indicating the date and meter dial reading at\nthe time of setting. When removing a meter, or when a reading is taken for\nrendering a final bill, the consumer shall be given the reading at the time and\nshall be given the opportunity to read the meter if he so desires. Footnotes\n1 Revised Form No. 2 and its corresponding instructions are\nset out in Appendix 9-A. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
