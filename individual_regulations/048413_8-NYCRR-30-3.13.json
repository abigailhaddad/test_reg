Tit. 8 §§ 30-3.13 - Monitoring and consequences for non-compliance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The department will annually monitor and\nanalyze trends and patterns in teacher and principal evaluation results and\ndata to identify districts and/or schools where evidence suggests that a more\nrigorous evaluation system is needed to improve educator effectiveness and\nstudent learning outcomes. The department will analyze data submitted pursuant\nto this Subpart to identify: (1)\nschools or\ndistricts with unacceptably low correlation results between student growth on\nthe student performance category and the teacher observation/principal school\nvisit category used by the district to evaluate its teachers and principals; and/or\n(2)\nschools or districts\nwhose teacher and principal overall ratings and subcomponent scores and/or\nratings show little differentiation across educators and/or the lack of\ndifferentiation is not justified by equivalently consistent student achievement\nresults; and/or schools or districts that show a pattern of anomalous results\nin the student performance and observation/school visits categories. (b) A district identified by the\ndepartment in one of the categories enumerated above may be highlighted in\npublic reports and/or the commissioner may order a corrective action plan, which may include, but not be limited to, a timeframe for the district to\naddress any deficiencies or the plan will be rejected by the commissioner, changes to the district's target setting process, a requirement that the\ndistrict arrange for additional professional development, that the district\nprovide additional in-service training and/or utilize independent trained\nevaluators to review the efficacy of the evaluation system. (c) Corrective action plans may require\nchanges to a collective bargaining agreement, subject to collective bargaining\nunder article 14 of the Civil Service Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
