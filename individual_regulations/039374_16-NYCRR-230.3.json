  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 230.3 - Charges for additional facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If, in order to provide service to an\napplicant, the gas corporation must install mains and appurtenant facilities in\naddition to those required to be provided without charge under section\n230.2\nof this Part, the\ncorporation shall impose a surcharge subject to the following provisions. (1)\n\nThe surcharge relating to mains and\nappurtenant facilities including return, depreciation, taxes and maintenance\nshall not exceed 20 percent per year of the actual reasonable cost of such\nfacilities that exceeds the portion which the corporation is required to\ninstall without charge to an applicant, if the corporation lays a main of four\ninches or less in nominal diameter (in the case of low pressure distribution)\nor of two inches or less in nominal diameter (in the case of high pressure\ndistribution). If the corporation lays a main greater than four inches in\nnominal diameter (in the case of low pressure distribution) or greater than two\ninches in nominal diameter (in the case of high pressure distribution), the\nsurcharge shall not exceed 20 percent per year of the estimated reasonable cost\nof a four-inch main (in the case of low pressure distribution), unless the\nestimated consumption of the proposed customer(s) requires the installation of\na larger-sized main, in which event the surcharge shall not exceed 20 percent\nper year of the actual reasonable cost of such main. The surcharge shall\ncommence when gas service is first available to an applicant and shall be paid\nratably for each billing period. (2)\n\nThe surcharge shall be reduced by 50\npercent of adjusted gas revenues, but the credit shall not exceed the amount of\nthe surcharge as determined above. (3)\n\nWhenever more than one customer is\nconnected to a main extension, the surcharge shall be so adjusted that the\ncorporation shall not receive in any one calendar year a greater percentage\nfrom all customers served from the main extension than that applicable to such\nextension. The surcharge shall also be reasonably allocated among the customers\nbeing served from the main extension, taking into account the portion of mains\nand appurtenant facilities which the corporation is required to provide without\ncharge to each customer served from such facilities. (4)\n\nEach surcharge shall cease: (i) whenever the length of a main extension\nrequired to be provided without charge to all customers served from such\nextension shall equal or exceed the total length of such extension; (ii)\nwhenever the total adjusted gas revenue\nfrom all customers served from a main extension shall equal or exceed 40\npercent of the cost of such extension in excess of that required to be provided\nwithout charge, in each of any two consecutive calendar years; or\n(iii)\nafter a period of 10 years following\nits commencement. (5)\n\nShould the adjusted gas revenue from all customers served from a main extension\nexceed the carrying cost of the entire extension, any surcharges (or\ncontributions) paid by such customers during the preceding five years shall be\nrefunded to such customers. (6)\n\nNo\nsurcharge shall be imposed if the total adjusted gas revenue from all customers\nserved from a main extension is estimated to exceed 40 percent of the actual\nreasonable cost of such extension in each of any two consecutive calendar\nyears. (b) If, in order\nto provide service to an applicant, the gas corporation must install service\nlines, service connections and appurtenant facilities in addition to those\nrequired to be provided without charge under section\n230.2\nof this Part, the\ncorporation may impose a charge for material and installation costs as set\nforth in its tariff approved by the commission.
