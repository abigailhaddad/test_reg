  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 52.24 - Rules relating to coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism and alcohol abuse in group (including group remittance policies issued by article 43 corporations) and school blanket health insurance policies\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn accordance with sections\n3221 (l)(6)-(7)\nand\n4303 (k)-(l)\nof the Insurance Law, the following rules shall apply: (a) Definitions. (1)\n\nFor the purposes of this section and sections\n3221 (l)(6)-(7)\nand\n4303 (k)-(l)\nof the Insurance Law, the following definition shall apply: (i) Coverage for inpatient hospital care, as referred to in the aforementioned sections of the Insurance Law, means reimbursement for hospitalization on an expense-incurred basis. (2)\n\nFor the purposes of this section and sections\n3221 (l)\nand\n4303 (l)\nof the Insurance Law, the following definitions shall apply: (i) Family members means those who are covered family members under the insurance policy covering the person receiving or in need of treatment for alcoholism or alcohol abuse. (ii)\n\nVisits means the rendering of diagnostic, medical or therapeutic services, including comprehensive visits, day visits or clinic visits as defined in Part 330 of Title 14 of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules and Regulations (regulations of the Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse governing outpatient facilities). Visits do not include socialization visits. (b) Benefits. (1)\n\nThe level of benefits must be consistent with the level of benefits for other diseases covered under the policy. (i) A maximum dollar payment may not be applicable to coverage for the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism and alcohol abuse unless a similar limitation is applicable to other diseases covered under the policy. (ii)\n\nAnnual deductibles and coinsurance amounts must be consistent with those imposed on benefits for other diseases covered under the policy. (2)\n\nProposals by insurers to substitute inpatient days of coverage not otherwise available under the policy for the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism and alcohol abuse, for outpatient visits for the diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism and alcohol abuse will be reviewed by the superintendent to determine if the proposal complies with the intent of sections\n3221 (l)(7)\nand\n4303 (l)\nof the Insurance Law. In no event may the number of covered outpatient visits in any calendar year be less than 30. (3)\n\nCoverage must include up to 20 outpatient visits for family members, even if the covered person in need of treatment has not received or is not receiving treatment for alcoholism or alcohol abuse, provided that the total number of such visits, when combined with those of the covered person in need of treatment, need not exceed 60 outpatient visits in any calendar year, and provided further that the 60 visits shall be reduced only by the number of visits actually utilized by the family members. Coverage for family members must include visits for remediation, through counseling and education, of the adverse effects on the physical and mental health of family members resulting from a close relationship with the covered person receiving or in need of treatment for alcoholism or alcohol abuse. (4)\n\nCoverage may be limited to one outpatient visit per day. (5)\n\nMajor medical insurance need not duplicate the mandated benefits for alcoholism and alcohol abuse payable under the insured's group or blanket hospital insurance. (6)\n\nCoverage may be limited to facilities in New York State which are certified by the Division of Alcoholism and Alcohol Abuse and, in other states, to those which are accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals as alcoholism treatment programs. Coverage must be provided for services rendered in and billed by these facilities, even if the services were rendered by a provider who would not otherwise be reimbursed under the policy. Coverage must be provided for services rendered in and billed by these facilities, notwithstanding the permissible exclusion for treatment in a government hospital set forth in section\n52.16\n(c)(8)\nof this Part, unless no charge would have been made in the absence of insurance. (7)\n\nInsurers may require a facility to submit a treatment plan within no less than 10 days from the date of the first visit. Insurers may also require that such a treatment plan be approved by the insurer as a condition of continued coverage. (8)\n\nInsurers may enter into participation arrangements whereby participating providers are reimbursed at different levels than nonparticipating providers. Deductibles and coinsurance amounts for services provided by nonparticipating providers must be consistent with those applicable to other services provided by nonparticipating providers under the insurance contract. (9)\n\nPolicies providing indemnity-type benefits and disability income benefits are not policies that provide coverage for inpatient hospital care and are therefore not subject to sections\n3221 (l)(6)-(7)\nand\n4303 (k)-(l)\nof the Insurance Law and this section. (10)\n\nPolicies providing coverage for accidents only are not subject to sections\n3221 (l)(6)-(7)\nand\n4303 (k)-(l)\nof the Insurance Law and this section. (c) Report to the superintendent. In accordance with sections\n3221 (l)(6)\nand\n4303 (k)\nof the Insurance Law, the following rules shall apply: (1)\n\nThe report must be furnished to the superintendent by all commercial insurers, article 43 corporations and HMO's.
