  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 155.7 - Health and safety in existing educational facilities\n\nState Regulations\n\nFacilities in school districts, other than city school\ndistricts in cities having 125,000 inhabitants or more, shall meet the\nfollowing requirements and, in particular instances, such other requirements as\nmay be deemed necessary by the commissioner to insure the health and safety and\naccident protection of occupants. (a) Exits. (1)\n\nThere shall be at least two means\nof egress remote from each other, leading from each floor occupied by pupils, including basements. (i) When pupils enter\ninto a corridor, there shall be a choice of two unobstructed means of egress in\ndifferent directions. (ii)\n\nHandrails shall be provided on at least one side of stairways, and on both\nsides of stairways 88 inches or more in width. (iii)\n\nThere shall be no storage under any\nstairs or landings unless the enclosure is of approved fire-resistant\nconstruction. (iv)\n\nProvision of\nfire escapes of approved design may be required where other exits are\ndetermined to be inadequate for fire safety. (2)\n\nDead-end corridor pockets shall not\nexceed a maximum depth of 11/2times the width of the pocket or 11/2 times the\nwidth of the corridor, whichever is less, unless otherwise approved by the\ncommissioner. (3)\n\nCorridors and\nexitways shall be kept clear and free of obstructions at all times. (4)\n\nFixed and portable security gates shall\nnot be located or used where they will obstruct exits or create dead-end\nconditions for occupied spaces. (5)\n\nEvery space of pupil occupancy over 500 square feet in area shall have two\nseparate means of egress from such space. A space of pupil occupancy is any\nroom or self-contained space housing pupils on a regular basis, other than a\nplace of assembly or small rooms where no more than 10 pupils are under direct, responsible, adult supervision. Each means of egress shall be in a separate\nsmoke zone, unless immediately adjacent to an approved exit. The primary exit\nis commonly the opening to the corridor. The second means of egress may be a\ndoor opening into a separate smoke zone, or a door directly to the exterior, or\na window of such size and design that will facilitate egress, or a door\nproviding egress through adjacent spaces where specifically approved. (i) Any point in a space of pupil occupancy\nshall not exceed a maximum of 50 feet straight-line distance to an exit, unless\notherwise approved by the commissioner. Any additional exit necessary to\nsatisfy this requirement shall be remote and may be required to be directly to\nthe exterior. (ii)\n\nWhen spaces of\npupil occupancy are defined in an open area by wardrobes, cabinetry and other\nfurniture which does not present obstructions to egress and which allows\nstudents to circulate freely from one space to another, the total open space is\nconsidered, for exiting purposes, as a single space. Exits from such\nopen-planned space shall meet requirements determined by the\ncommissioner. (6)\n\nRequired emergency egress windows shall be of a size and design, including\nhardware and, in appropriate instances, steps or ladder to high sills, that\nwill permit and facilitate emergency egress. Such windows shall be free of\nobstructing screens or storm sash. (i) The\nminimum clear opening area for such windows shall be six square feet, with a\nminimum dimension of 24 inches, unless otherwise approved by the\ncommissioner. (ii)\n\nAt least one\nsuch window in each space of pupil occupancy shall be marked with an\nappropriate sign identifying it as an emergency egress window. (7)\n\nPlaces of assembly. A place of\nassembly is any area used for the assembly of 100 or more persons, and spaces\nover 1800 square feet in area used for the assembling of persons. A place of\nassembly shall have at least two exits remote from each other. (i) Maximum occupancy for places of assembly\nshall be based on the number and size of existing approved exits on the basis\nof 50 persons for each one-half exit unit of 11 inches. Where existing exits\nare inadequate for the occupancy capacity of a place of assembly, or when\ndirected by the commissioner, signs restricting the number of occupants shall\nbe conspicuously posted at each exit location. Signs shall read in red letters\non white background: \"MAXIMUM OCCUPANCY --3\" high, 3/4\" stroke\nNOT TO EXCEED --2\" high, 1/2\" stroke\nXXX PERSONS\" --3\" high, 3/4\" stroke\n(8)\n\nCourtyards with completely\nenclosed perimeters are areas of possible pupil occupancy and must be provided\nwith exits as a space of pupil occupancy and as follows, unless otherwise\napproved by the commissioner: (i) Enclosed\ncourts up to a 700-square foot area shall have at least one exit equipped with\nhardware of a type which will always permit the door to be opened from the\ncourt side without the use of a key. (ii)\n\nEnclosed courts of more than a\n700-square foot area shall have at least two exits, remote from each other, equipped with hardware of a type which will always permit the door to be opened\nfrom the court side without the use of a key. (9)\n\nHardware. (i) All door hardware from spaces of pupil\noccupancy shall be of a type that will always permit the door to be opened from\nwithin the space without the use of a key. (ii)\n\nAll exterior and interior doors in\nexitways, and exit doors from places of assembly shall have panic hardware, except that panic hardware is not required for push/pull interior exit doors if\nthese doors have nonlatching hardware. Panic hardware shall not be required for\nexterior corridor doors serving less than three classrooms or for doors serving\nonly service areas such as boiler room, kitchen or storerooms. (iii)\n\nExit doors shall not be locked or\nchained or otherwise rendered inoperable from the inside at any time. (b) Smoke and\nfire control. As used in this subdivision, the terms Class \"A\", \"B\" or \"C\"\nrefer to types of construction which are defined by subdivision 11 of section\n11 of the Local Finance Law. (1)\n\nIn Class \"B\"\nand Class \"C\" buildings of two stories or more, unless otherwise approved, stairs shall be enclosed at each floor level and every floor shall be separated\nfrom levels above and below by stair enclosures and/or smoke barriers\nconstructed to obstruct effectively the passage of smoke and fumes, or every\nspace of pupil occupancy shall be provided with direct exit to the exterior. In\nappropriate instances, alternate means of egress may be required and stairway\nenclosures in Class \"A\" construction may be required. (2)\n\nClass \"B\" and Class \"C\" buildings shall\nnot have places of assembly above the first floor, except in a Class \"B\"\nbuilding a written exception may be granted where it is determined by the\ncommissioner that adequate exits exist. (3)\n\nIn appropriate instances, doors, walls\nand ceilings of places of assembly and exitways (corridors, stairs, vestibules, etc.) may be required to be finished with fire retardant materials or\ncoatings. (4)\n\nStairway enclosures\nrequired by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and smoke barriers required by\nparagraph (5) of subdivision (a) of this section shall be constructed of\nnoncombustible materials of such design and detail to obstruct effectively the\npassage of smoke and fumes.
