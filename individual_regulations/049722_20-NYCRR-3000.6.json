  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 3000.6 - Bill of particulars; admissions; depositions; disclosure prior to a licensing hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Bills\nof particulars. (1)\n\nAfter all pleadings have\nbeen served, a party may wish the adverse party to supply further details of\nthe allegations in a pleading to prevent surprise at the hearing and to limit\nthe scope of the proof. For this purpose, a party may serve written notice on\nthe adverse party demanding a bill of particulars within 30 days from the date\non which the last pleading was served. (2)\n\nThe written demand for a bill of\nparticulars must state the items concerning which such particulars are desired. If the party upon whom such demand is served is unwilling to give such\nparticulars, he or she may, in writing to the supervising administrative law\njudge, make a motion to the tribunal to vacate or modify such demand within 20\ndays after receipt thereof. The motion to vacate or modify should be supported\nby papers which specify clearly the objections and the grounds for objection. If no such motion is made, the bill of particulars demanded shall be served\nwithin 30 days after the demand, unless the administrative law judge designated\nby the tribunal shall direct otherwise. (3)\n\nIn the event a party fails to furnish a\nbill of particulars, the administrative law judge designated by the tribunal\nmay, upon motion, issue an order precluding the party from giving evidence at\nthe hearing of items of which particulars have not been delivered. A motion for\nsuch relief shall be made within 30 days of the expiration of the date\nspecified for compliance with the request. (4)\n\nWhere a bill of particulars is regarded\nas defective by the party upon whom it is served, the administrative law judge\ndesignated by the tribunal may, upon notice, make an order of preclusion or\ndirect the service of a further bill. In the absence of special circumstances, a motion for such relief shall be made within 30 days after the receipt of the\nbill claimed to be insufficient. (5)\nA preclusion order may provide that it\nwill be effective unless a proper bill is served within a specified\ntime. (b) Admissions. (1)\n\nAt any time after service of the answer, and not later than 20 days before the hearing, a party may serve upon any other\nparty a written request for admission of the following: (i) the genuineness of any papers or\ndocuments; (ii)\nthe correctness or\nfairness of representation of any photographs described in and served with the\nrequest; and\n(iii)\nthe truth of any\nmatters of fact set forth in the request. The request shall pertain to matters as to which the party\nrequesting the admission reasonably believes there can be no substantial\ndispute at the hearing, and which are within the knowledge of the adverse party\nor can be ascertained by him or her upon reasonable inquiry. Copies of the\npapers, documents or photographs shall be served with the request unless copies\nhave already been furnished. (2)\n\nThe party to whom the request to admit is\ndirected may choose to respond by serving a statement expressly admitting the\nmatters in question. However, the party is deemed to admit each of the matters\nas to which an admission was properly requested unless, within 20 days after\nservice of the request, or within such further time as the supervising\nadministrative law judge may allow, the party to whom the request is directed\nserves upon the party requesting the admission, a verified statement: (i) denying specifically the matters of which\nan admission is requested; (ii)\nsetting forth in detail the reasons why those matters cannot be truthfully\nadmitted or denied; or\n(iii)\nsetting forth a claim in detail that the matters of which an admission is\nrequested cannot be fairly admitted without some material qualification or\nexplanation, that the matters constitute a trade secret or that such party\nwould be privileged or disqualified from testifying concerning them. Where the\nclaim is that the matters cannot be fairly admitted without some material\nqualification or explanation, the party must admit the matters with such\nqualification or explanation. (3)\n\nAny admission made, or deemed to be made, by a party pursuant to a request made under this section, is for the purpose of\nthe pending proceeding only, and does not constitute an admission for any other\npurpose, nor may it be used in any other proceeding in the Division of Tax\n\nAppeals. The administrative law judge designated by the tribunal may, at any\ntime, allow a party to amend or withdraw any admission on such terms as may be\njust. Any admission shall be subject to all pertinent objections to\nadmissibility which may be interposed at the hearing. (c) Depositions to perpetuate testimony. A\nparty to a case pending in the Division of Tax Appeals, who desires to\nperpetuate his own testimony or that of any other person or to preserve any\ndocument or thing, shall file an application pursuant to this section for an\norder of an administrative law judge authorizing such party to take a\ndeposition for such purpose. Such depositions shall be taken only where there\nis a substantial risk that the person or document or thing involved will not be\navailable at the hearing of the case, and shall relate only to testimony or\ndocument or thing which is not privileged and is material to a matter in\ncontroversy. (1)\n\nThe application. Content of\napplication. The application to take a deposition shall be signed by the party\nseeking the deposition or his representative, and shall show the following: (i) the names and addresses of the persons to\nbe examined; (ii)\nthe reasons for\ndeposing those persons rather than waiting to call them as witnesses at the\nhearing; (iii)\nthe substance of the\ntestimony which the party expects to elicit from each of those\npersons; (iv)\na statement showing\nhow the proposed testimony or document or thing is material to a matter in\ncontroversy; (v) a statement\ndescribing any books, papers, documents, or tangible things to be produced at\nthe deposition by the persons to be examined; (vi)\nthe time and place proposed for the\ndeposition; (vii)\nthe officer\nbefore whom the deposition is to be taken; (viii)\nthe date on which the petition was\nfiled with the Division of Tax Appeals; (ix)\nany provision desired with respect to\npayment of expenses, fees, and charges relating to the deposition (see\nparagraph [6] of this subdivision); and\n(x) if the applicant proposes to videotape\nthe deposition, the application shall so state, and shall show the name and\naddress of the videotape operator and of his employer. (2)\n\nFiling and disposition of application. The application may be filed with the Division of Tax Appeals at any time after\nthe petition is filed. The application shall be made to the administrative law\njudge assigned to the case or if no administrative law judge has yet been\nassigned to the supervising administrative law judge. The applicant shall serve\na copy of the application on each of the other parties to the case, as well as\non such other persons who are to be examined pursuant to the application, and\nshall file with the application a certificate showing such service. Such other\nparties or persons shall file their objections or other response, with a\ncertificate of service thereof on the other parties and such other persons, within 15 days after such service of the application. A hearing on the\napplication will be held only if directed by the administrative law judge. Unless the administrative law judge shall determine otherwise for good cause\nshown, an application to take a deposition will not be regarded as sufficient\nground for granting an adjournment from a date of hearing theretofore set. If\nthe administrative law judge approves the taking of a deposition, he will issue\nan order which will include in its terms the name of the person to be examined, the time and place of the deposition, and the officer before whom it is to be\ntaken. If the deposition is to be videotaped, the administrative law judge's\norder will so state. (3)\n\nUse of\nstipulation. The parties or their counsel may execute and file a stipulation to\ntake a deposition by agreement instead of filing an application as hereinabove\nprovided. Such a stipulation shall be filed with the supervising administrative\nlaw judge in duplicate, and shall contain the same information as is required\nin subparagraphs (1)(i), (vi), (vii), (ix), and (x) of this subdivision but\nshall not require the approval or an order of the administrative law judge\nunless the effect is to delay the hearing of the case. A deposition taken\npursuant to a stipulation shall in all respects conform to the requirements of\nthis section. (4)\n\nPerson before\nwhom deposition taken. Depositions shall be taken before an officer, other than\na party, or the attorney or employee of a party, authorized to administer oaths\nby the laws of the place where the examination is held. (5)\n\nArrangements. All arrangements necessary\nfor the taking of the deposition shall be made by the party filing the\napplication or, in the case of a stipulation, by such other persons as may be\nagreed upon by the parties. (6)\n\nExpenses. The party taking the deposition shall pay all the expenses, fees and\ncharges of the witness whose deposition is taken by him, any charges of the\nofficer presiding at or recording the deposition other than for copies of the\ndeposition, and any expenses involved in providing a place for the deposition. The party taking the deposition shall pay for the original of the deposition; and, upon payment of reasonable charges therefor, the officer shall also\nfurnish a copy of the deposition to any party or the deponent. By stipulation\nbetween the parties, provision may be made for any costs, charges or expenses\nrelating to the deposition. Except under extraordinary circumstances, an\nadministrative law judge shall not order a deposition to be held outside of the\n\nState of New York unless the expenses of the Division of Taxation are paid by\nthe party requesting the deposition. (7)\n\nUse of deposition. At the hearing or in\nany other proceeding in the case, any part or all of a deposition, so far as\nadmissible under the rules of evidence applied as though the witness were then\npresent and testifying, may be used against any party who was present or\nrepresented at the taking of the deposition or who had reasonable notice\nthereof, in accordance with any of the following provisions: (i) The deposition may be used by any party\nfor the purpose of contradicting or impeaching the testimony of deponent as a\nwitness. (ii)\n\nThe deposition of a\nparty may be used by an adverse party for any purpose. (iii)\n\nThe deposition may be used for any\npurpose if the parties have stipulated to the use of a deposition or if the\nadministrative law judge finds: (a) that the\nwitness is dead; or\n(b) that the\nwitness is at such distance from the place of trial that it is not practicable\nfor him to attend, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was\nprocured by the party seeking to use the deposition; or\n(c) that the witness is unable to attend or\ntestify because of age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment; or\n(d) that the party offering the deposition\nhas been unable to obtain attendance of the witness at the hearing, as to make\nit desirable in the interests of justice, to allow the deposition to be used; or\n(e) that such exceptional\ncircumstances exist, in regard to the absence of the witness at the hearing, as\nto make it desirable in the interests of justice, to allow the deposition to be\nused. (iv)\n\nIf only part\nof a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an adverse party may require\nhim to introduce any other part which in fairness ought to be considered with\nthe evidence the party introduced, and any party may introduce any other\nparts. (8)\n\nDepositions\non written questions. (i) A deposition may be\ntaken on written questions when the parties so stipulate or when the\nadministrative law judge so orders because the testimony is to be taken outside\n\nNew York State. (ii)\n\nThe party\nseeking the deposition shall serve the written questions upon each party. Within 10 days thereafter, a party so served may serve written cross questions\nupon each party. Within five days thereafter, the original party may serve\nwritten redirect questions upon each party. Within three days after being\nserved with written redirect questions, a party may serve written\nrecross-questions upon each party. (iii)\n\nCopies of all written questions served\nshall be delivered by the party seeking the deposition to the office designated\nin the administrative law judge's order. (d) Disclosure of evidence prior to a license\nrevocation hearing. When the Division of Taxation seeks the revocation of a\nlicense or permit, as such terms are used in section 401.4 of the State\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act, either party shall, upon demand and at least\nseven days prior to the hearing, disclose the evidence that the party intends\nto introduce at the hearing, including documentary evidence and the\nidentification of witnesses. The provisions of this subdivision shall not be\ndeemed to require the disclosure of information or material otherwise protected\nby law from disclosure, including information and material protected because of\nprivilege, the secrecy provisions of the Tax Law or confidentiality. If, after\nsuch disclosure, a party determines to rely upon other witnesses or\ninformation, the party shall, as soon as practicable, supplement its disclosure\nby providing the names of such witnesses or the additional documents.
