  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 274.5 - Standards\n\nState Regulations\nA resolution of the compliant will be based upon the\napplication of one, all or a combination of the following surveying\nprinciples: PERPENDICULAR METHOD\nEstablishing the outshore lateral lines between the\nriparian/littoral zones by turning 90 degrees from a base line is referred to\nas the perpendicular method. This can be done from a baseline established\nbetween headlands in a cove and applying the proportionate method. The baseline\ncan also be the thread of a stream, or river and in some cases the general\ntrend of the shore such as along the Long Island Sound. Nevertheless, the\nriparian/littoral zone is established along a line perpendicular to the\nbaseline and extending the same to intersect the property line at the\nshoreline. Image\nLONG LAKE METHOD\nEstablishment of the littoral zone for the elongated body\nof water is accomplished by the Long Lake method. The lateral lines are\nestablished by a line perpendicular from the thread of the lake to the point of\ncontact of the property corners at the shore. The ends of the lake are divided\nby the Round Lake method. Image\nROUND LAKE (PIE) METHOD\nEstablishment of the littoral zone for a circular body of\nwater is accomplished in a manner which is called the Round Lake or Pie Method. In this method, a point in the center of the body of water is established and a\nline drawn from the property corner at the shore is extended outshore to the\nestablished point at the center of the body of water. Image\nCOLONIAL METHOD\nThis method is used to apportion riparian/littoral zones by\ndrawing a baseline from one corner of each lot to the other, at the margin of\nthe upland, and running a line from each of their corners, at right angles to\nthe baseline to the thread of the water body. The angle produced by the two\nlines established is bisected to establish the lateral outshore\nriparian/littoral zone. Image\nPROPORTIONATE THREAD OF THE STREAM METHOD\nApportionment is made among several riparian owners in such\na manner that each owner has the same percentage of footage in the thread of\nthe stream as they have along the shoreline. Measure the shoreline, measure the\nthread of the stream, then divide the thread of the stream distance by the\nshoreline distance and multiply the resulting factor by the shoreline distance\nfor each lot along the shoreline. The distance obtained is applied to the\nthread of the stream and the riparian/littoral zone is determined by connecting\nthe lines between the shoreline property points with the outshore points\nestablished along the thread. Image\nPRACTICAL LOCATION\nWhen upland owners deliberately make outshore improvements\nadjacent to their upland ownership with the understanding that such area\nrepresents their true riparian zone, such area may be established by practical\nlocation. This principle will usually apply when there is evidence of long term\nuse and acquiescence by adjoining owners and the application of another method\nwould adversely affect the majority of riparian owners within the immediate\nvicinity. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n274.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
