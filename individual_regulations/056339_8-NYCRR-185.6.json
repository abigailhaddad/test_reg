  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 185.6 - Special approvals for disposition of records\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Records not listed on a records retention\nand disposition schedule. Records not listed on a records retention and\ndisposition schedule shall not be disposed of without the approval of the\ncommissioner. Whenever a local government record is identified as not being\nlisted on a records retention and disposition schedule, the commissioner, in\naccordance with section\n57.25\n(2)\nof the Arts and Cultural Affairs Law, will determine the minimum length of time the record needs to be retained and\nissue an amendment to all appropriate schedules. (b) Records damaged by natural or manmade\ndisasters. Local governments may apply to the commissioner to dispose of\nrecords whose retention periods have not expired in cases where those records\nhave been damaged by natural or manmade disaster, and when the information\ncontained in those records is substantially destroyed or obliterated or the\nrecords constitute a human health or safety risk. Those records may be disposed\nof following application to the commissioner and after the consent of the\ncommissioner has been granted. (c) Disposition of records predating 1910. No local government may dispose of\nrecords predating 1910 without special approval of the commissioner. In\ndetermining whether such approval shall be granted, the commissioner shall\nconsider whether the records for which disposition is sought substantially\nduplicate information contained in other records being retained, possess\nsignificant intrinsic value, have significant and enduring value for research\nand are in appropriate physical condition for use in research. This provision\nshall also apply to the disposition of original records predating 1910 which\nhave been reproduced by microphotography or other means. (d) Disposition of employee disciplinary, investigative and performance evaluation records. Notwithstanding any minimum\nretention period set forth in a records retention and disposition schedule\nissued by the commissioner pursuant to this Part, a local government may\ndispose of, or remove certain information from specified employee disciplinary, investigative and performance evaluation records, prior to the time when the\nappropriate minimum retention period has expired, when this disposition or\nremoval is based on a provision of a collective bargaining agreement in effect\nbetween a local public employer and a public employee labor\norganization.
