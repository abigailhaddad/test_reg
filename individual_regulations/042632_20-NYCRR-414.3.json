(2)\nA\nhospital\nfor purposes of the Public Health Law does not\ninclude an institution, sanitarium or other facility engaged principally in\nproviding services for the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of mental\ndisability and which is subject to the powers of visitation, examination, inspection and investigation of the Department of Mental Hygiene except for\nthose distinct parts of such a facility which provide hospital\nservices. (3)\nA\nhospital\nas defined in section\n1.03\nof the Mental Hygiene Law means the\ninpatient services of a psychiatric center under the jurisdiction of the Office\nof Mental Health or other psychiatric inpatient facility in the Department of\n\nMental Hygiene, a psychiatric inpatient facility maintained by a political\nsubdivision of the State for the care or treatment of the mentally ill, a ward, wing, unit, or other part of a hospital, as defined in article 28 of the Public\n\nHealth Law, operated as a part of such hospital for the purpose of providing\nservices for the mentally ill pursuant to an operating certificate issued by\nthe Commissioner of Mental Health, or other facility providing inpatient care\nor treatment of the mentally ill which has been issued an operating certificate\nby such commissioner. (c) (1)\n\nIn\naddition to being a hospital which holds a current operating certificate issued\nby the New York State Department of Health or the New York State Department of\n\nMental Hygiene, the hospital must also qualify as an exempt organization for\nsales and compensating use tax purposes pursuant to section\n1116 (a)(4)\nof the Tax Law. In general, as a qualifying exempt organization, a hospital must be organized\nand operated exclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, testing for\npublic safety, literary or educational purposes, or to foster national or\ninternational amateur sports competition or for the prevention of cruelty to\nchildren. No part of a qualified hospital's net earnings may be used to benefit\nany private shareholder or individual. As an exempt organization, a hospital is\nsubject to all of the provisions of section\n529.7\nof this Title. (2)\n\nTo establish its\nstatus as an exempt organization, a hospital must submit to the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance a completed application for an exempt organization\ncertificate in accordance with section\n529.7\n(f) of this Title. Upon approval of the application, the department will issue the\napplicant a numbered exempt organization certificate. (d) (1)\n\nWhere a qualified hospital as defined in this section imports motor fuel or\ncauses motor fuel to be imported into New York State or produces, refines, manufactures or compounds motor fuel in New York State for its own use or\nconsumption, such hospital is a distributor of motor fuel and must be\nregistered as a distributor and report these activities monthly, by filing\nreturns with the Department of Taxation and Finance, even though no tax may be\ndue. In the event the hospital does not use or consume all such motor fuel and\notherwise distributes the fuel in the State, it is subject to the tax imposed\npursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law on the motor fuel\ndistributed. (2)\n\nWhere motor fuel\nis purchased by a qualified hospital, without the seller passing through the\nmotor fuel tax, and such fuel is not used or consumed by the hospital, but is\notherwise distributed in the State, such hospital is jointly and severally\nliable with the recipient of the motor fuel for the payment of the motor fuel\ntax. (e) A\nqualified hospital\n(as defined herein) may purchase motor fuel\nupon which the seller has not passed through the motor fuel tax by issuing to\nthe seller of the fuel a properly completed tax exemption certificate for\nqualified hospitals. Such exemption certificate must disclose the hospital's\nexempt organization certificate number referred to in paragraph (c)(2) of this\nsection. An exemption certificate for a qualified hospital should be given to\nthe seller of motor fuel at the time of an initial purchase. A separate\nexemption certificate need not be given for each additional purchase of motor\nfuel, provided each delivery of such fuel is substantiated as being exempt from\ntax with an individual bill, invoice, receipt or other form of written evidence\ngiven by the seller showing the qualifying hospital as the purchaser. Every\nbill, invoice, receipt or other form of written evidence must indicate the\nquantity of motor fuel received, the purchase price of the fuel without regard\nto any exemption and the price paid or to be paid by the exempt purchaser for\nsuch fuel. In addition, such evidence of exemption must reflect the hospital's\nexempt organization certificate number and must be signed and dated by the\nindividual taking delivery of the motor fuel on behalf of such hospital. Sellers of motor fuel must establish a system of associating these individual\nbills, invoices, receipts and other forms of evidence with the tax exemption\ncertificate for qualified hospitals initially received from the\npurchaser. (f) All purchases of\nmotor fuel upon which the seller has not passed through the motor fuel tax by a\nqualified hospital must be billed directly to the hospital and paid from the\nfunds of such hospital. (g) (1)\n\nAny person selling motor fuel to a\nqualified hospital for such hospital's own use or consumption, as described in\nthis section, who has not passed through to the hospital the motor fuel tax\nwill be allowed a refund or credit in the amount of the motor fuel tax paid or\nassumed by, or passed through to such person but not passed through to the\nexempt purchaser. Records sufficient to substantiate all exemptions and any\nrefund or credit claimed on the basis of such exemptions must be maintained by\nthe seller. (See Part 415 of this Title for refunds, credits and\nreimbursements.)\n(2)\nA registered\ndistributor must report motor fuel sold to a qualified hospital in its monthly\nreturn of tax on motor fuels and may deduct the quantity so sold in arriving at\nthe net taxable gallonage to the extent such fuel was sold without passing\nthrough to such hospital the motor fuel tax.
