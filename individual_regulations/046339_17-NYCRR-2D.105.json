  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2D.105 - All Terrain Vehicle Route Signs (NYM17-1, NYM17-2)\n\nState Regulations\n\nStandard: 01 All Terrain Vehicle Route (NYM17-1, NYM17-2) signs (see\n\nSign Drawing SD-G14) shall be used on highways where all terrain vehicles are\npermitted by official designation, in accordance with Section\n2405\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law. Guidance: 02 The sign used should be that which most clearly\nrepresents the type of all terrain vehicle using the route. The NYM17-1 sign\nshould be used where trail bikes predominate, and the NYM17-2 sign should be\nused where four-wheeled all terrain vehicles are in the majority. The signs\nshould not be intermixed within a route. 03 All Terrain Vehicle Route signs should be used in\ncombinations and assemblies similar to other route signs, except that Junction\nassemblies should not be used, and Advance Route Turn assemblies are normally\nunnecessary. Standard: 04 All auxiliary signs supplementing the All Terrain\n\nVehicle Route sign shall have white legends and green backgrounds. Guidance: 05 All Terrain Vehicle Route signs should be supplemented\nby the BEGIN (M4-14) auxiliary sign (see Section 2D.23) at the beginning of a\nroute and the END (M4- 6) auxiliary sign (see Section 2D.22) at the end of a\nroute. 06 All Terrain Vehicle Route sign assemblies should be\nlocated to clearly mark the permitted travel path. They should be placed in\nadvance of, and beyond, route turns (Directional and Confirming assemblies), at\nintersections with other all terrain vehicle routes, and at intermediate\nlocations, as necessary. The distance between successive signs along a route\nshould be no more than 3000 feet. Option: 07 An All Terrain Vehicle Route sign supplemented by a M6-4\n\nDirectional Arrow auxiliary sign may be used on a highway to identify an all\nterrain vehicle route crossing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2D.105\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
