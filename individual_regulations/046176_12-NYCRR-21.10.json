  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 21.10 - Authorized installation of anchors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Fastenings. (1)\n\nAnchor fastenings, except nuts, reinforcing plates and washers which are protected from the weather, shall be\nof the same metal as the anchor. (2)\n\nEvery fastening bolt or machine screw\nshall be machined from bar stock or hot forged. It shall have at least\nthree-sixteenths inch of unthreaded length under the head and threads shall be\ncut. (3)\n\nEvery reinforcing plate\nshall be of steel and shall be cleaned and painted with at least one coat of\ncorrosion resistant paint before installation. (4)\n\nNuts and machine screws shall be screwed\ntight without producing excessive stress. (5)\n\nTo prevent turning, loosening or backing\noff, threads shall be peened close to the nut or plate or in lieu thereof, heavy lockwashers, firm locknuts or other positive means of retaining the\nfinished position of threaded parts may be provided. (b) Installation in pairs. (1)\n\nAnchors shall be installed so as to be\nusable in pairs from a position on the sill from which the cleaning is done and\nwith each terminal of the safety belt attached to a separate anchor. (2)\n\nOne anchor shall be installed at each\nside of a window which may be, and is to be cleaned by the authorized method of\nworking from the sill or ledge, so that each window has its own pair of\nanchors, except: where three double-hung windows with two separating mullions\nare set in one wall opening and the outer sash openings are less than 21 inches\nin width, anchors need not be installed at the outer sides of the outer\nwindows. (c) Height\nabove sill. Anchors shall be between 42 and 51 inches above the sill or\nledge. (d) Terminal space. Each\nanchor shall be located so as to permit easy attachment and removal of a\nterminal and free play of the terminal when attached. (e) Accessibility from inside. Anchors shall\nbe located so as to permit easy attachment of a terminal to either anchor\nwithout extending more than one arm beyond the sash opening. (f) Wooden frames. (1)\n\nAnchors shall be attached to wood or\nmetal covered wood window frames or mullions by bolts not less than\nthree-eighths inch in diameter which pass through the entire window frame or\nmullion by holes not more than seven-sixteenths inch in diameter drilled\nthrough a solid section, such as a pulley stile or equivalent, of the frame or\nmullion. (2)\n\nBolts shall be\nsecurely fastened by a nut and washer. (3)\n\nThe outside diameter of such washer shall\nbe at least twice the diameter of the bolt hole. (4)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of\nthis Part, the ends of such bolts shall be peened to prevent loosening or\nremoval of the nuts. (5)\n\nThe back\nface of anchors for installation in wood windows, frames or mullions shall be\nprovided with at least two sharp lugs or equivalent means to prevent turning of\nanchor after installation. (6)\n\nSuch\ninstallations shall be made only where frames are securely attached to the\nbuilding. (g) Installation of masonry type anchors. (1)\n\nHereafter masonry type anchors shall not be installed in existing masonry or\nconcrete walls, nor in any poured concrete. Such anchors shall be installed\nonly in new walls of masonry unit construction. (2)\n\nNo such anchor shall be installed unless\nit is shaped to build into the joints between the masonry units being\nused. (3)\n\nEach such anchor shall be\nfirmly imbedded in the masonry and so placed that its flange bears flush\nagainst the masonry unit. (h) Installation on hollow metal window\nframes. (1)\n\nFrame requirements. Anchors shall\nnot be installed on hollow metal window frames more than 10 feet in height\nunless such frames are approved. All other such frames shall meet the following\nspecifications. (i) Hollow metal window\nframes shall be of steel, aluminum or bronze. If made of any type of steel, the\nminimum thickness of the metal shall be 0.025 inch and its minimum ultimate\ntensile strength shall be 60,000 psi. (ii)\n\nIf made of aluminum, they shall be made\nof extruded aluminum alloy, type 6063 T5, or equivalent, and the minimum\nthickness of the metal shall be 0.062 inch. (iii)\n\nIf made of bronze, they shall be made\nof extruded architectural bronze, type Copper Alloy No. 385 as designated by\nthe Copper and Brass Research Association, or its equivalent, and the minimum\nthickness of the metal shall be 0.078 inch. (2)\n\nAttachment of anchors to hollow metal\nframes. (i) At least two bolts or machine\nscrews not less than three-eighths inch in diameter and of proper length shall\npass through the frame and through the middle of a steel reinforcing plate\nplaced on the inside of the frame. (ii)\n\nProvision shall also be made by means of\nadequate stiffeners to transmit the force of any load placed on the window\nanchors to the full cross section or depth of the jamb or mullion. (iii)\n\nBolts shall be secured by means of nuts\nand lock washers. (iv)\n\nIf bolts are\nnot used, the reinforcing plate shall be tapped to receive the machine screws, which shall be screwed through the plate with at least one complete thread\nprotruding. (v) In installations\nmade after February 25, 1964, a lock washer shall be provided under the head of\nthe machine screw. (vi)\n\nReinforcing\nplates shall be at least five-sixteenths inch thick and three-quarters inch\nwide. (vii)\n\nWhen used with steel\nwindow frames reinforcing plates shall be at least 12 inches long if the frame\nmetal thickness is less than 0.062 inch and at least six inches long if the\nframe metal thickness is 0.062 inch or more. (viii)\n\nAluminum and bronze window frames\nshall have reinforcing plates at least 12 inches long. (3)\n\nExisting installations on hollow metal\nframes. Installations of approved anchors made before February 25, 1964, on\nframes of ferrous metal shall be in accordance with the provisions of former\n\nIndustrial Code Rule No. 21 which were in effect at the time of installation. Such installations on sound and substantial frames of aluminum at least 0.062\ninch thick or bronze at least 0.078 inch thick, if made in accordance with the\nprovisions of former Industrial Code Rule No. 21 relating to installations on\nframes of ferrous metal which were in effect at the time of installation, are\nhereby authorized. (i) Installation on solid metal window frames. (1)\n\nAnchors shall be attached to solid metal frames by at least two bolts or\nmachine screws not less than three-eighths inch in diameter which shall be of\nproper length and shall pass through the frame. (2)\n\nBolts shall be secured on the inside by\nnuts and lock washers. (3)\n\nIf bolts\nare not used, the frame shall be tapped its entire thickness and the machine\nscrews shall be screwed through the frame with at least one complete thread\nprotruding. (4)\n\nIn such instances\nthe thickness of the frame shall afford at least five-sixteenths inch length of\nthreaded hole or a tapped reinforcing plate shall be used as for hollow metal\nframes, and in installations made after February 25, 1964, a lock washer shall\nbe provided under the head of the machine screw. (j) Attachment of frames to wall\nconstruction. Window frames shall be so designed, constructed and installed as\nto be securely fastened to the wall construction. (k) Firm installation required. Every\ninstallation and its supporting structural features shall be firm and stable. Anchors and anchor fastenings shall be secured to prevent them from turning, backing off or becoming loose. (l) Evidence of compliance. In respect to the requirements of this Part regarding\nthe metal used in or in connection with metal frame windows, whether hollow or\nsolid, their internal construction, their installation in or attachment to a\nbuilding structure and the attachment of anchors to them, the manufacturer, builder or installer, as the case may be, shall prepare a written and signed\nstatement setting forth in detail the facts establishing that such frames and\ntheir installation are in accordance with the requirements of this Part and\nshall cause such statement to be filed with the commissioner. Upon the filing\nof such a certificate the commissioner may, if he finds it sufficient, accept\nit as presumptive evidence of the facts therein stated. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
