There is hereby established the New York\n\nState Commission on Sentencing Reform (\"Commission\"). 2.

The Governor\nshall select a Chair of the Commission from among the members. A majority of\nthe members of the Commission shall constitute a quorum, and all\nrecommendations of the Commission shall require approval of a majority of the\ntotal members of the Commission. 4. The Commission shall conduct a comprehensive review of New York's current\nsentencing structure, sentencing practices, community supervision, and the use\nof alternatives to incarceration, including a review and evaluation of: (a) the existing statutory provisions by\nwhich an offender is sentenced to or can be released from incarceration, including but not limited to indeterminate sentences, determinate sentences, definite sentences, sentences of parole supervision, merit time, supplemental\nmerit time, shock incarceration, temporary release, presumptive release, conditional release, and maximum expiration; (b) the existing sentencing provisions as to\ntheir uniformity, certainty, consistency and adequacy; (c) the lengths of incarceration and\ncommunity supervision that result from the current sentence structure, and the\nincentives or barriers to the appropriate utilization of alternatives to\nincarceration; (d) the extent to\nwhich education, job training and re-entry preparation programs can both\nfacilitate the readiness of inmates to transition into the community, and\nreduce recidivism; (e) the impact\nof existing sentences upon the state criminal justice system, including state\nprison capacity, local jail capacity, community supervision resources, judicial\noperations and law enforcement responsibilities; (f) the relation that a sentence or other\ncriminal sanction has to public safety and the likelihood of recidivism; and\n(g) the expected future trends\nin sentencing. 5. In\nundertaking its review, the Commission may request documents, conduct public\nhearings, hear the testimony of witnesses, and take any other actions it deems\nnecessary to carry out its functions. 6. The Commission shall make recommendations\nfor amendments to state law that will maximize uniformity, certainty, consistency and adequacy of a sentence structure such that: (a) the punishment is aligned with the\nseriousness of the offense; (b) public safety is protected through the deterrent effect of the sentences\nauthorized and the rehabilitation of those that are convicted; and\n(c) appropriate consideration is accorded to\nthe victims of the offense, their families, and the community. Reports of the\n\nCommission shall include, but not be limited to, an evaluation of the impact\nthat existing sentences have had on length of incarceration, the impact of\nearly release, the impact of existing sentences on the length of community\nsupervision, recommended options for the use of alternatives to incarceration, and an analysis of the fiscal impact of the Commission's\nrecommendations. 7.
