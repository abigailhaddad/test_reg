  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 328.6 - Authorized chemicals and specifications\n\nState Regulations\n\nRotenote for extermination of undesirable fish. (Removal of\nentire fish populations.)\n(a) Purpose. Authorized for extermination of entire fish complexes where reasonable as a\nbasis for sound fisheries management. Not authorized for partial treatments or\nelimination of a single species from the population. (b) Periods of treatment. In waters with\noutlets, or possible outlets at high water, treatment will be authorized from\n\nJuly to mid-September. Waters without outlets may be treated up to October 15. Later treatment will require special authorization. (c) Dosage. Not to exceed 0.5 to 1.0 ppm\nrotenone and vehicle of five percent by weight emulsifiable rotenone, or two\nand one-half percent synergized emulsifiable rotenone. The high dosage should\nbe considered only for waters which are weedy, turbid or of high alkalinity. Note:The issuing agent should check the volume and dosage\nand for this purpose insist that an adequately sized scale map complete with\nsoundings be provided by the applicant. (d) Treatment area. Entire lakes and ponds\nshall be treated, including any tributary system. Permits will not be issued\nfor streams or parts of streams unless within such tributary system. (e) Method of application. Diluted solution\nshall be sprayed for effective coverage and to avoid uneven distribution. Shallow waters and ponds up to five acres and tributaries should be treated by\nhand pumps. Larger waters and those over 15 feet in depth should be treated\nwith pressure or centrifugal pumps. The suction side may be used to draw and\nmix water and chemical before they are sprayed on the surface. A proportionate\namount should be distributed to the deeper water by dragging a weighted\ndischarge hose. Tributaries are to be treated for several days after the pond\ntreatment. (f) Posting of treated\narea. If the applicant is unable or does not desire to control access and use\nof the area, he shall post it to indicate the treatment given. (g) Water-use restrictions. While rotenone at\nthe recommended concentration is not harmful to man or animals after\ndistribution, less is known of the effect of vehicle and additives. Due to the\npossibility of high localized and surface concentrations: (1)\n\nWatering animals shall be restricted for\ntwo weeks following treatment. (2)\n\nSwimming shall be restricted until the water has become non-toxic to fish or\nfor not less than two weeks if the toxicity is dissipated sooner. (3)\n\nUse as a private water supply shall be\nrestricted for the same time and same reasons as swimming. Treatment of a\npublic water supply must be authorized by the supply agency. In this case, restriction shall be left to the supply agency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n328.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
