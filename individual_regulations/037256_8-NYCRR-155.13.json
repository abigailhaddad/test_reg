(e) The priority of approval of all projects\nwhich meet the requirements of this section shall be based upon the building\naid ratio of each school district selected for purposes of building aid in the\ncurrent year. Projects from districts with the highest aid ratios shall be\napproved first, and subsequent projects shall be approved according to\ndescending order of such aid ratios. In the case of projects from districts\nwith identical aid ratios, the commissioner will, to the extent that funds are\navailable, approve projects for the districts of greatest need as determined by\nthe commissioner.
