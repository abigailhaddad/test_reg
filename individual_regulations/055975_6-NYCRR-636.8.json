Tit. 6 § 636.8 - Cooperative projects\n\nState Regulations\n\nTwo or more councils may join in cooperative projects that will be of benefit to all participants. Such endeavors may include, but are not limited to, the hiring of consultants, employment of personnel, conduct of studies and investigations, and the gathering of natural resource inventory data. Participating councils must arrange to be billed separately for their respective shares (which do not have to be equal) of the cost. A unified cooperative project budget is not authorized. Cooperative projects exceeding a total value of $500 require prior approval of the commissioner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n636.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
