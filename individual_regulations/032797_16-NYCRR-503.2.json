  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 503.2 - System pressures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) System\npressures. Minimum working pressure (the pressure under all conditions except\nfire flows) in all portions of the water corporation's distribution system\nshould not be less than 35 pounds per square inch (psi). Additionally, for new\nwater plant construction designed to serve five or more customers, the minimum\ndesign pressure should also be an amount that, upon calculation, would\ntheoretically be sufficient to maintain 15 psi at an 8 gallons per minute (gpm)\nflow at the meter. If this condition is not met, but the pressure on the\ncompany's main in the immediate area satisfies the 35 psi requirement (or has\nbeen exempted from such requirement by the commission), it will be the\nresponsibility of the developer/owner of new properties requesting service to\nmake all modifications necessary to meet the pressure and flow standard\nrequired at the meter. The maximum customer pressure at the building line\nshould be 100 psi, except where differences in elevation require pressure\nhigher than 100 psi in order to meet the minimum working pressure in other\nparts of the distribution system. In such cases where the system pressure\nexceeds 100 psi, the company should attempt to reduce the pressure to 100 psi\nby creating a separate pressure zone or installing pressure-reducing valves in\nthe distribution system. If a company can demonstrate that this is impractical\ndue to excessive cost or engineering considerations, the customer will have the\noption of installing an individual pressure-reducing valve. The customer\nexercising this option will be responsible for purchasing, maintaining and\nreplacing such valve, and all costs associated therewith. (b) Monitoring requirements. Each water\ncorporation shall have the necessary equipment to record an individual\ncustomer's pressure and to make pressure surveys and record at least a 24-hour\ncontinuous test. Each water corporation shall monitor the system pressure in\neach pressure zone at or near the point of highest elevation in the zone, where\nthe lowest pressures can be expected to be experienced, and shall report to the\ndepartment on a monthly basis each instance when the pressure drops below the\nminimum working pressure as previously specified for a period of four hours or\nlonger. Likewise, pressure will be monitored in each pressure zone at or near\nthe point of the lowest elevation in the zone where the highest pressures can\nbe expected to be experienced. This monitoring requirement may be satisfied by\nusing the readings taken at one of the water corporation's regular operating\nstations provided that the water corporation can demonstrate that it can\naccurately extrapolate the pressures at the highest and lowest elevations from\nsuch readings. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n503.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
