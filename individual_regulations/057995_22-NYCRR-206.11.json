  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 206.11 - Recording of civil depositions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When permitted. Depositions\nauthorized under the provisions of the CPLR or other law may be taken, as\npermitted by CPLR 3113(b), by means of simultaneous audio and visual\n(audiovisual) electronic recording, provided such recording is made in\nconformity with this section. (b) Other rules applicable. Except as\notherwise provided in this section, or where the nature of audiovisual\nrecording makes compliance impossible or unnecessary, all rules generally\napplicable to examinations before trial shall apply to audiovisual recording of\ndepositions. (c) Notice of taking depositions. Every notice or subpoena for the taking of an\naudiovisual deposition shall state that it is to be recorded by audiovisual\nmeans and the name and address of the operator and of the operator's employer, if any. The operator may be an employee of the attorney taking the deposition\nor of the Department of Law. Where an application for an order to take an\naudiovisual deposition is made, the application and order shall contain the\nsame information. (d) Conduct of the examination. (1)\n\nThe deposition shall begin by one of the attorneys or the operator stating on\ncamera: (i) the operator's name\nand address; (ii)\nthe\nname and address of the operator's employer; (iii)\nthe date, the time and place of the\ndeposition; and\n(iv)\nthe party on whose behalf the deposition is being taken. The officer before whom the deposition is\ntaken shall be identified as a person authorized by statute to swear the\nwitness and shall swear the witness on camera. (2)\n\nEvery audiovisual deposition\nshall be recorded with a time-date generator which shall permanently display\nthe hours, minutes, and seconds. Each time the recording is stopped and\nresumed, such times shall be announced on the recording. Additionally, the\noperator shall announce the beginning and the end of such audiovisual\nrecording. (3)\n\nMore\nthan one camera may be used, either in sequence or simultaneously. (4)\n\nAt the conclusion of the\ndeposition, a statement shall be made on camera that the recording is\ncompleted. As soon as practicable thereafter, the recording shall be shown to\nthe witness for examination, unless such showing and examination are waived by\nthe witness and the parties. (5)\n\nTechnical data, such as recording\nspeeds and other information needed to replay or copy the recording, shall be\nincluded on copies of the recorded deposition. (e) Copies and transcription. The parties may make audio copies of the deposition and thereafter may purchase\nadditional audio and/or audiovisual copies. A party may arrange to have a\nstenographic transcription made of the deposition at the party's own\nexpense. (f) Certification. The officer before whom the deposition is taken shall cause to\nbe attached to the original audiovisual recording a certification that the\nwitness was fully sworn or affirmed by the officer and that the recording is a\ntrue record of the testimony given by the witness. If the witness has not\nwaived the right to a showing and examination of the deposition, the witness\nshall also sign the certification in accordance with the provisions of CPLR\n3116. (g) Filing and\nobjections. (1)\n\nIf no objections\nhave been made by any of the parties during the course of the deposition, the\naudiovisual recording and one copy may be filed by the proponent with the clerk\nand shall be filed upon the request of any party. (2)\n\nIf objections have been made\nby any of the parties during the course of the deposition, the audiovisual\nrecording, with the certification, shall be submitted to the court upon the\nrequest of any of the parties within 10 days after its recording, or within\nsuch other period as the parties may stipulate, or as soon thereafter as the\nobjections may be heard by the court, for the purpose of obtaining rulings on\nthe objections. An audio copy may be submitted in lieu of the audiovisual\nrecording for this purpose, as the court may prefer. The court may also require\nsubmission of a stenographic transcript of the portion of the deposition to\nwhich objection is made. (3)\n(i) The court shall rule on the\nobjections prior to the date set for trial and shall return the recording to\nthe proponent of the audiovisual recording with notice to the parties of its\nrulings and of its instructions as to editing. The editing shall reflect the\nrulings of the court and shall remove all references to the objections. The\nproponent, after causing the audiovisual recording to be edited in accordance\nwith the court's instructions, may cause both the original recording and the\nedited version of the recording, and a copy of each, clearly identified, to be\nfiled with the clerk, and shall do so at the request of any party. Before such\nfiling, the proponent shall permit the other party to view the edited\nrecording. (ii)\n\nThe\ncourt may, in respect to objectionable material, instead of ordering its\ndeletion, permit such material to be clearly marked so that the audio recording\nmay be suppressed by the operator during the objectionable portion when the\naudiovisual recording is presented at the trial. In such case the proponent may\ncause both the original and a marked version of that recording, and a copy of\neach, clearly identified, to be filed with the clerk of the court, and shall do\nso at the request of any party. (h) Custody of audiovisual\nrecording. When the audiovisual recording is filed with the clerk of the court, the clerk shall give an appropriate receipt and shall provide secure and\nadequate facilities for the storage of the recordings. (i) Use at trial. The use of\naudiovisual recording recordings of depositions at the trial shall be governed\nby the provisions of the CPLR and all other relevant statutes, court rules and\ndecisional law relating to depositions and relating to the admissibility of\nevidence. The proponent of the audiovisual deposition shall have the\nresponsibility of providing whatever equipment and personnel may be necessary\nfor presenting such recorded deposition. (j) Applicability to audio recording of\ndepositions. Except where clearly inapplicable because of the lack of a visual\nportion, these rules are equally applicable to the taking of depositions by\naudio recording alone. However, in the case of the taking of a deposition upon\nnotice by audio recording alone, any party, at least five days before the date\nnoticed for taking the deposition, may apply to the court for an order\nestablishing additional or alternate procedures for the taking of such audio\ndeposition, and upon the making of the application, the deposition may be taken\nonly in accordance with the court order. (k) Cost. The cost of recording a\ndeposition shall be borne by the party that served the notice for the recording\nof the deposition. (l) Transcription for appeal. On appeal, audiovisual and audio depositions shall be\ntranscribed in the same manner as other testimony and transcripts filed in the\nappellate court. The audiovisual and audio depositions shall remain part of the\noriginal record in the case and shall be transmitted therewith. In lieu of the\ntranscribed deposition and, on leave of the appellate court, a party may\nrequest a review of portions of the audiovisual or audio deposition by the\nappellate court but, in such case, a transcript of pertinent portions of the\ndeposition shall be filed as required by the court.
