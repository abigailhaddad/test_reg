Where such an election is\nmade, the first annual installment shall be paid to the administrator at the\nsame time that the first contribution on behalf of a participant is made\npursuant to section\n154.6\nof this Part. Each subsequent\nannual installment shall be paid in each of the four years immediately\nsucceeding the year in which the first installment is paid, together with\ninterest at the rate determined pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section on\nthe unpaid balance of the prior service contribution as of the date of such\npayment; provided, however, that in the event that the administrator notifies\nthe sponsor that a participant has been determined eligible for a distribution\nof a service award prior to the payment of the fifth annual installment, the\ngoverning board of the sponsor shall cause payment to be made to the\nadministrator of an unscheduled prior service contribution within 30 days of\nreceiving such notice. The unscheduled prior service contribution shall equal\nthe unpaid balance of the participant's prior service contribution plus\ninterest at the rate determined pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section on\nsuch unpaid balance. (c) On or\nbefore March 31st of each year the administrator shall determine the rate of\ninterest to be paid on the unpaid balance of prior service contributions.
