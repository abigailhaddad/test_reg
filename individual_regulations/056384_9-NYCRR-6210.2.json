  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6210.2 - Routine testing of voting systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Testing of all voting systems shall be conducted by the county board before the\nuse of the system in any election and at such other times of the year as\nprescribed by these regulations. Testing procedures shall be approved by the\n\nState Board. The voting system shall be tested to determine that the system is\nfunctioning correctly and that all system equipment, including but not limited\nto hardware, memory, and report printers, are properly integrated with the\nsystem and are capable of properly performing in an election. Testing, other\nthan pre-qualification testing, shall be conducted by casting manual votes and\nmay include the casting of simulated votes. (b) All voting equipment owned by a county\nboard of election shall be tested at least once every calendar year. All other\nvoting equipment that has not undergone pre-qualification testing prior to use\nin any election in the calendar year shall be tested no later than December\n31st of the calendar year. Such tests are in addition to vendor-prescribed\nmaintenance tasks and diagnostic tests, conducted by the county board. Whenever\na voting system is to be tested for pre-qualification purposes, such test must\nbe conducted while the voting system is in election mode. Votes cast for\npre-qualification test purposes shall be manually cast using all of the devices\navailable to voters on election day (i.e.: audio, key pads and or pneumatic\nswitches, and/or alternate language displays). (c) Testing shall include the comparison of software installed on\nthe delivered system to certified software, via the use of a Secure Hash\n\nSignature Standard (SHS) Validation Program, as described in Federal\n\nInformation Processing Standards Publication 180-2 issued by the National\n\nInstitute Standards Technology (This publication is available electronically by\naccessing the NIST website. Alternatively, copies of NIST computer security\npublications are available from: National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161.)\n\nTesting shall consist of the re-calibration of equipment, as\nappropriate, pursuant to recommendations made in vendor's maintenance\ndocumentation, and the casting of a test deck by voting the minimum number of\nballots, determined pursuant to the requirements of section\n6210.8\nof this Part, to ensure that\nall voting positions for each ballot configuration are tested. Votes cast for\nthe purposes of this section shall be cumulative ballots cast on each piece of\nequipment. (1)\n\nIf the system does not\naccurately count the votes from the test deck cast manually, simulated, or\nboth, (aside from those that were deliberately designed to fail), or the\ncalibration test, the cause or causes for the error or errors shall be\nascertained and corrected. The voting system shall be retested until there are\ntwo consecutive error-free tests before the system is approved for use in the\ncount of actual ballots. The commissioners of the county board or their\ndesignees shall certify that they have reviewed and verified the results of\nsaid testing. The summary results of all tests, including all inaccurate test\nresults, their causes and the actions taken to correct them, as well as the\nresults of all errorless counts, shall be entered upon the maintenance log. Maintenance logs are to be kept as a permanent record of the county board. All\nother documentation and/or test decks, simulation cartridges and any test data\nincluding but not limited to copies of ballot programming used for required\nmaintenance tests shall be maintained in secure locked storage for two years\nafter the election, pursuant to Election Law section 3-222. (d) For pre-qualification testing of a system\nto be used in a primary election, the test ballot format for each piece of\nequipment assigned for use in said primary election shall consist of each\nprimary ballot configuration as certified by the county board. The voting\nsystem shall be cleared of all votes and a printed report shall be produced by\nthe system, to verify the correct ballot configuration and election\nconfiguration, and to confirm that all voting positions are at zero. Ballots\ncast for the purposes of this test shall be manually cast and a printed\ntabulation report shall be produced. The system shall again be cleared of all\nvotes and a printed report shall be produced by the system to confirm that all\nvoting positions are at zero. Each officer or board charged with the duty of\npreparing voting machines for use in any election shall give written notice\npursuant to Election Law section 7-128 and section 7-207, by first class mail, to the State Board and to all candidates, except candidates for member of the\ncounty committee, who are lawfully entitled to have their names appear thereon, of the time when, and the place where, they may inspect the voting machines to\nbe used for such election. The candidates or their designated representatives\nmay appear at the time and place specified in such notice to inspect such\nmachines, provided, however, that the time so specified shall be not less than\ntwo days prior to the date of the election. (e) For the period between ballot\ncertification and seven days before the general election, the test ballot\nformat for each piece of equipment shall consist of each general election\nballot configuration as certified by the county board. The voting system shall\nbe cleared of all votes and a printed report shall be produced by the system, to verify the correct ballot configuration and election configuration, and to\nconfirm that all voting positions are at zero. Ballots cast for the purposes of\nthis test shall be manually cast and a printed tabulation report shall be\nproduced. The system shall again be cleared of all votes and a printed report\nshall be produced by the system to confirm that all voting positions are at\nzero. Each officer or board charged with the duty of preparing voting machines\nfor use in any election shall give written notice pursuant to Election Law\nsection 7-128 and section 7-207, by first class mail, to the State Board and to\nall candidates, except candidates for member of the county committee, who are\nlawfully entitled to have their names appear thereon, of the time when, and the\nplace where, they may inspect the voting machines to be used for such election. The candidates or their designated representatives may appear at the time and\nplace specified in such notice to inspect such machines, provided, however, that the time so specified shall be not less than two days prior to the date of\nthe election. (f) In addition to\nany vendor provided training, the State Board shall provide training on routine\nmaintenance and testing of voting systems to county board personnel responsible\nfor voting systems. The State Board shall provide sample tests to be utilized\nby each county board. The State Board may revise said testing format, based\nupon its audit and review. (g) All\nresults of any testing in addition to pre-qualification testing, including the\nfinal errorless test, shall be certified as accurate by the county board\ncommissioners or their designees, and such certification shall be entered upon\nthe maintenance log for each such piece of equipment, together with any other\ninformation prescribed in said log by the State Board. (h) The county board shall certify to the\n\nState Board, the completion of any, testing including prequalification testing. All documentation and/or test decks, simulation cartridges and any test data\nincluding but not limited to copies of ballot programming used for required\nmaintenance tests shall be maintained in secure locked storage for two years\nafter the election, pursuant to Election Law section 3-222. Such certification\nshall be on a form prescribed and furnished by the State Board, and shall be\naccompanied by copies of each maintenance log. (i) Each county shall keep a detailed log of\nmaintenance performance and testing procedures. Such logs shall be in a format\nprovided by the State Board and the same shall have been reviewed by the\nvendor. (j) Such logs shall be\nprovided upon completion of any testing, including pre-qualification testing or\nas requested by the State Board, for their review and inspection, and shall be\nmade available to the public, upon request. (k) The State Board may, upon review of the\nmaintenance logs, require further testing of any such piece of equipment or may\nremove a piece of equipment from use in an election until further examination\nand testing has been completed, or may rescind certification pursuant to\nsection\n6209.8\nof the State Board\nregulations. (1)\n\nThe State Board may\nreinstate the certification if the equipment passes these further tests, and a\nreview of the maintenance logs supports such reinstatement. (2)\n\nCounty boards shall make the system or\nequipment available to the State Board for any such additional testing and\nshall provide such assistance as may be deemed necessary. (l) During the initial time period in which\nsuch system or equipment is used, to include a primary election and a general\nelection, the State Board shall assist in the routine maintenance, testing and\nthe operation of the voting machines or systems. Such assistance shall include\nbut not be limited to: (1)\nelection\nconfiguration and ballot configuration related to voting system testing and\nuse; (2)\npre-qualification and\npost-election tests; (3)\nelection\nday support, via phone, email, facsimile or on-site, as necessary; (4)\npost-election support, to include\nrecanvass, challenges, and audit conducted pursuant to Election Law section\n9-211; (5)\nstaff\ntraining; (6)\ndefining personnel\nrequirements and tasks; (7)\ndefining\nprocedures for pre-qualification, post-election, and maintenance tests; and\n(8)\ndefining procedures for\ncanvassing and recanvassing votes cast in an election. (m) During successive years, the State Board, whenever it deems necessary, or at the request of a county board, may assist in\nany or all aspects of the operation of the system\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp.
