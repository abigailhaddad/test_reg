  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 161.3 - New York State elections not controlled by Federal elections\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Examples of New York State elections upon\nwhich Federal elections are not binding are those relating to: (1)\nthe claiming of the New York standard\ndeduction or the New York itemized deduction by a taxpayer who has claimed\nitemized deductions on his Federal income tax return; (2)\nthe filing of a joint New York State\npersonal income tax return or separate New York State personal income tax\nreturns on one form by a husband and wife who file a joint Federal income tax\nreturn; (3)\nthe allocation or\ndivision of the New York standard deduction between a husband and wife who\ndetermine their New York taxable incomes separately, either on separate forms\nor on one form; and\n(4)\nthe\nallocation or division of the New York itemized deduction between a husband and\nwife who determine their Federal taxable income jointly and determine their New\n\nYork taxable incomes separately on one form. Where a husband and wife claim\nitemized deductions and determine their Federal taxable incomes separately, no\nsuch allocation or division of the New York itemized deduction is permitted. (See section 115.10 of this Title.)\n(b) A taxpayer's election as to any of the\nmatters listed in subdivision (a) of this section may be changed without prior\napplication to the Tax Commission, subject to the conditions stated in section\n161.4\nof this Part. (c) Other elections\nfor New York State personal income tax purposes which are independent of any\nelection for Federal income tax purposes. (1)\n\nThe election to claim an overpayment of New York State income tax computed on a\n\nNew York State personal income tax return as a credit against the estimated\nincome tax for the succeeding year is a New York State election independent of\nany election for Federal income tax purposes. If a taxpayer elects to have an\noverpayment of New York State income tax for a taxable year so credited, such\ntaxpayer cannot thereafter change such election with respect to the overpayment\nfor that taxable year. (2)\n\nThe\nelection by a nonresident person to file or not to file on a group New York\n\nState nonresident personal income tax return is a New York State election\nindependent of any election for Federal income tax purposes. If a nonresident\nperson elects to file on a group New York State nonresident personal income tax\nreturn, such nonresident person may not file an amended New York State\nnonresident personal income tax return on an individual basis after the 15th\nday of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year. Similarly, if\na nonresident person elects to file on an individual basis, such nonresident\nperson may not file an amended New York State nonresident personal income tax\nreturn on a group basis after the 15th day of the fourth month following the\nclose of the taxable year. However, if a nonresident person's status changes in\nsuch a way as to prevent such nonresident person from qualifying to file on a\ngroup return, such nonresident person shall be permitted or required, as the\ncase may be, to file an amended return. Such amended return must be filed\nwithin the time prescribed by section\n687\nof the Tax Law. (3)\n\nThe election by a nonresident member of a\nprofessional athletic team to file or not to file on a group New York State\nnonresident personal income tax return is a New York State election independent\nof any election for Federal income tax purposes. If a nonresident member of a\nprofessional athletic team elects to file on a group New York State nonresident\npersonal income tax return, such member may not file an amended New York State\nnonresident personal income tax return on an individual basis after the 15th\nday of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year. Similarly, if\na nonresident member of a professional athletic team elects to file on an\nindividual basis, such member may not file an amended New York State\nnonresident personal income tax return on a group basis after the 15th day of\nthe fourth month following the close of the taxable year. However, if a\nnonresident member's status changes in such a way as to prevent such member\nfrom being able to qualify as an electing nonresident member of a professional\nathletic team, such individual shall be permitted or required, as the case may\nbe, to file an amended return. Such amended return must be filed within the\ntime prescribed by section\n687\nof the Tax Law. (d) Any election for New York State personal\nincome tax purposes which is not controlled by the taxpayer's election for\n\nFederal income tax purposes, other than the elections covered by subdivisions\n(a) and (c) of this section, may be changed after the due date of the original\n\nNew York State personal income tax return only with the prior approval of the\n\nTax Commission, and only upon such terms and conditions as the Tax Commission\nmay specify in each individual case.
