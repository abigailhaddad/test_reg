(1)\n\nFor survey units exclusive of those in\nthe special assessing unit of Nassau County determine the initial number of \"S\"\nintervals in a sample class from Table 1 below. (i) If the number of parcels in the sample\nclass is less than 16 parcels, the initial number of intervals equals the\nnumber of intervals indicated in the table. (ii)\n\nIf the number of parcels in the sample\nclass is greater than 15 parcels, the initial number of intervals is equal to\nthe number of intervals indicated in the table minus one. TABLE 1\n\nNumber of parcels in sample\nclass\n\nNumber of\nintervals\n\nMinimum interval\nsample size\nless than 7\n1\n\nNumber of parcels\n7 to 15\n2\n3\n16 to 79\n3\n3\n80 to 499\n4\n3\n500 to 999\n4\n4\n1,000 to 3,999\n5\n4\n4,000 to 9,999\n6\n4\n10,000 to 19,999\n7\n4\n20,000 to 29,999\n8\n4\n30,000 to 39,999\n9\n4\nequal to or greater than 40,000\n10\n4\n(2)\n\nFor the special assessing unit of Nassau\n\nCounty, determine the initial number of \"S\" intervals in a sample class from\n\nTable 2 below. (i) If the number of parcels in\nthe sample class is less than 20, the initial number of intervals equals the\nnumber of intervals in the table. (ii)\n\nIf the number of parcels in the sample\nclass is greater than 19, the initial number of intervals equals the number of\nintervals indicated in the table minus one. TABLE 2\n\nNumber of parcels in sample\nclass\n\nNumber of\nintervals\n\nMinimum interval\nsample size\nless than 13\n1\n\nNumber of parcels\n13 to 19\n2\n6\n20 to 79\n3\n4\n80 to 499\n4\n4\n500 to 999\n4\n5\n1,000 to 3,999\n5\n4\n4,000 to 9,999\n6\n4\n10,000 to 19,999\n7\n4\n20,000 to 29,999\n8\n4\n30,000 to 39,999\n9\n4\nequal to or greater than 40,000\n10\n4\n(b) Determine the boundaries and contents of\n\"S\" intervals. (1)\n\nSum the parcel assessed\nvalues in the sample class from high to low, and test the sum after each parcel\nis added. (2)\n\nAt each step in the\nprocess, test the cumulative assessed value of the interval being constructed\nagainst the result of the sample class total assessed value, minus the\ncumulative assessed value of previously completed intervals, divided by the\nnumber of intervals left to be completed. (3)\n\nWhen the test indicates that, including\nthe latest parcel added, the cumulative assessed value for the interval exceeds\nthe test amount, the latest parcel is determined to be included in the\ninterval, and the interval being processed is complete. (4)\n\nWhen an interval is complete, the\ninterval total assessed value is subtracted from the sample class test amount\nremaining to be assigned, and the count of intervals remaining to be\nconstructed is reduced by one. (5)\n\nThis procedure continues until all parcels in the sample class have been\nassigned to a value interval. (6)\n\nFor identification purposes, the value interval which contains the parcel with\nthe lowest assessed value is numbered \"001.\" Subsequent intervals are\nidentified from high to low by adding one to the previous interval identifying\nnumber. (c) Determine\nboundaries and contents of subintervals. (1)\n\nExamine the first value interval (S001) and determine the number of parcels\nthat it contains. (i) If the interval contains\nless than 15 parcels, or all the parcels in the original interval have the same\nassessed value, the boundaries and contents of the interval remain\nunchanged. (ii)\n\nIf the interval\ncontains 15 or more parcels with different assessed values, create two\nsubintervals by comparing the assessed values of the parcels in the original\ninterval to the mean assessed value of the original interval and assigning\nparcels, highest assessed value to lowest, to the higher subinterval until an\nassessed value not greater than the mean assessed value is found. (iii)\n\nThe first parcel found with an assessed\nvalue not greater than the mean assessed value of the original interval, and\nall remaining parcels from the original interval, are assigned to the lower\nsubinterval. (2)\n\nFor\nidentification purposes, the subinterval which contains the parcel with the\nlowest assessed value is numbered \"001.\" The second subinterval is numbered\n\"002.\" Subsequent intervals are identified from low to high by adding one to\nthe previous interval identifying number. (d) Allocate class tentative sample size to\n\"S\" intervals. (1)\n\nThe class tentative sample\nsize, rounded to the nearest integer, is divided by the number of intervals, resulting in an integer and a remainder. Interval sample sizes are then set, from the lowest value to the highest, equal to the integer plus one for the\nnumber of intervals equal to the remainder, and equal to the integer for any\nadditional intervals. (2)\nthe interval sample sizes from paragraph (1) of this subdivision to the minimum\ninterval sample sizes shown in subdivision (a) of this section; the larger\nsample size is the interval sample size. (3)\nA sample class in the special assessing\nunit of Nassau County which has greater than 19 parcels and two intervals has a\nminimum interval sample size of six. A sample class in the special assessing\nunit of Nassau County which has greater than 19 parcels and three intervals has\na minimum interval sample size of four. (4)\n\nWhere the interval sample size would be\ngreater than the number of parcels in the interval, the interval sample size is\nequal to the number of parcels. (5)\n\nThe sum of the interval sample sizes is the sample class sample size. (6)\n\nSample class sample size cannot exceed\nthe number of parcels in the class. (e) Randomly select the sample parcels and\nalternates for each \"S\" interval. (f) Assign to each large unit exactly one \"T\"\ninterval and select the large unit as the sample parcel for that\ninterval. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
