  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 § 5.5 - Layoff of competitive class employees\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. In connection with the\nsuspension, demotion and displacement of competitive class employees authorized\nby section\n80\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law, the following terms shall mean: (1)\n\nVertical bumping shall mean displacement\nby a permanent incumbent of another incumbent serving in a position in a title\nin direct line of promotion as provided in subdivision 6 of section\n80\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law. (2)\n\nRetreat\nshall mean displacement by a permanent incumbent of another incumbent serving\nin a position in the title not in direct line of promotion in which the\ndisplacing incumbent served at a prior time as provided in subdivision 6 of\nsection\n80\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law. (3)\n\nNext lower\noccupied title shall mean the title in direct line of promotion immediately\nbelow the title from which the incumbent is suspended or demoted, unless no one\nserves in that title in that layoff unit, in which case it shall be the closest\nlower title in direct line of promotion in that layoff unit in which one or\nmore persons do serve. (4)\n\nSatisfactory service shall mean service by an employee during the final rating\nperiod of which he did not receive an \"unsatisfactory\" performance rating, and\nwas not found guilty of misconduct or incompetency pursuant to either section\n75\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law or a disciplinary procedure provided by labor contract which, in either case, resulted in the imposition of any of the following penalties\nupon such employee: (i) dismissal from the\nservice; (ii)\nsuspension without\npay for a period exceeding one month; or\n(iii)\ndemotion in grade and title. (b) Advance decisions. An appointing authority may take such steps as it may deem necessary in order\nto secure binding written commitments in advance of suspension, demotion or\ndisplacement from employees potentially affected by such suspension, demotion\nor displacement as to their willingness to accept reassignment or\ndisplacement. (c) Order of\ndisplacement. When two or more permanent incumbents of positions in a specific\ntitle are suspended, demoted or displaced at the same time, the order in which\nthey shall be entitled to displace shall be determined by their respective\nretention standing, with those having the greater retention standing entitled\nto displace first. This principle shall apply to both vertical bumping and\nretreat. (d) Displacement by\nprobationers. (1)\n\nProbationer having a right\nto a permanent position. An employee who is serving in a probationary term and\nwho has a position formerly held by him on a permanent basis being held open\nfor him has no displacement rights from the position in which he is serving the\nprobationary term pursuant to section\n80\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law and is afforded none by these rules. (2)\n\nProbationer without a right to a\npermanent position. An employee who is serving a probationary term and who has\nno position formerly held by him on a permanent basis being held open for him\nshall nevertheless have the possibility of displacing upon being suspended or\ndisplaced from the position wherein he is serving a probationary term; provided, however: (i) he has previously\ncompleted at least five years of continuous service which shall also have been\nsatisfactory service; and\n(ii)\nhe\nshall not be allowed to displace ahead of any permanent incumbents. The order\nof displacement among such probationers shall be determined by their respective\nretention standing, with those having the greater retention standing entitled\nto displace first. (e) Refusal or failure to accept appointment\nto a position afforded by displacement. The refusal or failure of a person to\naccept appointment to a lower grade position to which he is entitled through\ndisplacement shall not affect his right to be placed on a preferred list for\nthe position from which he was suspended, demoted or displaced. (f) Retreat where title of position has been\nchanged. A permanent incumbent who has been suspended or displaced shall be\nallowed to retreat to a position in which he last served even though the title\nof such position has been changed; provided, however, that there has been no\nsubstantial change in duties. (g) Preferred list standing for competitive class employees on and after October 1, 1972 shall be as follows: (1)\n\nOn and after\n\nOctober 1, 1972, those employees whose positions were abolished prior to that\ndate, and who therefore had their standing on the preferred list determined by\nthe date of their original appointment on a permanent basis in the competitive\nclass, shall retain among themselves such preferred list standing including the\npreferences to which they were entitled as blind, disabled veterans and\nnondisabled veterans. (2)\n\nBlind\nemployees whose positions are abolished on or after October 1, 1972 shall have\ntheir preferred list standing determined by the date of their original\nappointment on a permanent basis in the classified service, whether or not they\nare also disabled veterans or nondisabled veterans; provided, however, that the\nblind shall be granted absolute preference on the preferred list over all other\nemployees except those disabled veterans and blind employees whose positions\nwere abolished prior to October 1, 1972, with those names theirs shall be\ninterfiled. (3)\n\nDisabled veterans\nwhose positions are abolished on or after October 1, 1972 shall have their\npreferred list standing determined by the date of their original appointment on\na permanent basis in the classified service; provided, however, that the date\nof such original appointment shall be deemed to be 60 months earlier than the\nactual date, determined in accordance with section\n30\nof\nthe General Construction Law. (4)\n\nNondisabled veterans whose positions are abolished on or after October 1, 1972\nshall have their preferred list standing determined by the date of their\noriginal appointment on a permanent basis in the classified service; provided, however, that the date of such original appointment shall be deemed to be 30\nmonths earlier than the actual date, determined in accordance with section\n30\nof\nthe General Construction Law. (5)\n\nNonveterans whose positions are abolished on or after October 1, 1972 shall\nhave their preferred list standing determined by the date of their original\nappointment on a permanent basis in the classified service. (6)\n\nThe names of all persons encompassed by\nparagraphs (3), (4) and (5) of this subdivision whose positions are abolished\non or after October 1, 1972 shall be interfiled on the preferred list with the\nnames of all nonveterans whose positions were abolished prior to October 1, 1972. (h) Adjunctive\nopportunities. (Pursuant to the authority to provide adjunctive opportunities\nfor displacement granted by subdivision 6 of section\n80\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law.) If a permanent incumbent of a position in the State service\nis suspended or displaced from a position in a title for which there are no\nlower level occupied positions in direct line of promotion, he shall displace\nthe incumbent with the least retention right, pursuant to subdivisions 1 and 2\nof section\n80\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law, who is serving in a position in the title with a lower\nsalary grade in which the displacing incumbent last served on a permanent basis\nprior to service in one or more positions in the title from which he is\nsuspended or displaced, if: (1)\nthe service\nof the displacing incumbent while in such former title was satisfactory; and\n(2)\nthe position of the junior\nincumbent is in: (i) the competitive, noncompetitive or labor class; (ii)\nthe layoff unit from which the displacing incumbent was suspended or displaced; and\n(iii)\na lower salary grade than\nthe position from which the displacing incumbent is suspended or displaced; provided, however, that no incumbent shall displace any other incumbent having\ngreater retention standing.
