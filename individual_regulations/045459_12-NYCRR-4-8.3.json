Suitable explosion vents extending to the outside air shall be\ninstalled on storage bins, cyclone collectors and piping for central storage\nsystems of pulverized coal. (b) Ignition of pulverized coal. A large and stable pilot flame to insure proper\nignition of the pulverized coal shall be provided. Manual ignition with oil\nsoaked torches is prohibited. If an oil burning pilot is used, it shall burn\npressure-atomized number two or other light grade fuel oil having a discharge\nrate of 20 to 50 gallons per hour. If a gas pilot is used, the burner shall\ndeliver gas at a rate of not less than 1,000 cubic feet per hour. (c) Starting the boiler.

(f) Central\nstorage interlocks. If a central storage system is used, electrical interlocks\nshall be provided on conveyors, pulverizer motors and blowers, and separate\nblowers which shall automatically shut down all of the units ahead of any\nsingle unit in order to prevent coal from piling up in the system if a single\nunit should fail.
