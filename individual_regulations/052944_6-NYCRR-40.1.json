White\nside fillets and skin may be removed for use as bait provided the carcass of\nthe summer flounder with dark side completely intact is retained and available\nfor inspection to determine compliance with the size limit. Any such carcasses\ncount against the possession limit. It is unlawful to discard overboard the\ncarcass of any summer flounder from which a fillet or skin has been removed as\nbait once fishing has begun. (2)\n\nHolders of a valid New York State marine and coastal district party and charter\nboat license, issued pursuant to Environmental Conservation Law, section\n13-0336, may fillet summer flounder on board the vessel covered by the license\nsubject to the following conditions: (i) For\neach fishing trip taken by a vessel, summer flounder parts or racks (remains of\nfish after fillets have been removed) must not be discarded overboard once any\nperson on board the vessel begins to fish and until the vessel returns to its\ndock. (ii)\n\nSummer flounder racks\nmust not be mutilated to the extent that the length or species of fish cannot\nbe determined. (iii)\n\nAll summer\nflounder racks must be retained (unmixed with any other material) in a separate\ncontainer readily available for inspection until such time as the vessel has\ndocked and all passengers from that trip have disembarked. (iv)\n\nAll summer flounder racks from the\nprevious trip must be disposed of prior to any person beginning to fish on a\nsubsequent trip. (v) Violators of\nany of the provisions of this subdivision are subject to the penalties\nestablished pursuant to the provisions of article 71 of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law and may be subject to license revocation pursuant to Part 175\nof this Title. (3)\n\nParty\nand Charter Boat License holders must provide each customer who possess more\nthan 30 scup during the period of September 1 through October 31 with a\ncommercially printed, dated original fare receipt, bearing the vessel's name\nand the permit number. The customer of any licensed party or charter boat who\nlands or possesses more than 30 scup during the period of September 1 through\n\nOctober 31 must possess an original receipt from that party or charter\nboat. (4)\n\nParty and charter boat\nlicense holders must provide each customer who possesses more than 3 bluefish\nwith a commercially printed, dated original fare receipt, bearing the vessel's\nname and the permit number.

Persons on such vessels may not fish for\n\nAtlantic cod in state waters while utilizing this transit\nprovision. (j) Striped\nbass commercial fishing-special regulations. (1)\n\nGeneral provisions. The total season\nharvest may not exceed the amount approved for New York by the Atlantic States\n\nMarine Fisheries Commission pursuant to the Interstate Fishery Management Plan\nfor striped bass. The annual quota shall be adopted by directive issued by the\n\nChief, Bureau of Marine Resources, consistent with the provisions of\nsubdivision (u) of this section. (2)\n\nStriped bass legally harvested from other\nstates may be sold or offered for sale during New York's closed commercial\nseason provided they meet the provisions of paragraph (23) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nExcept as provided\nin paragraph (g)(4) of this section, it is unlawful to possess striped bass\nfrom which the head or tail have been removed or that have been otherwise\ncleaned, cut, filleted, or skinned so that the total length or identity cannot\nbe determined unless such fish is being prepared for immediate\nconsumption. (4)\n\nIt is unlawful for\nany person to take or possess striped bass for commercial purposes on any\ncharter vessel, open boat or any other vessel while carrying passengers for\nhire for the purpose of fishing. All persons on such vessel carrying passengers\nfor hire for the purpose of fishing must comply with Table A of this section\nand any special regulations and shall not possess striped bass tags or tagged\nstriped bass. (5)\n\nConviction for or\ncivil settlement of a violation of any provision of subdivision (d) or (g) of\nthis section may disqualify the convicted or settling person from receiving\nfuture striped bass permits pursuant to Part 175 of this Title. (6)\n\nThe department may close the commercial\nfishery for striped bass when the harvest is projected, based upon weekly\nreports and independent monitoring of the commercial fishery, to exceed the\ntotal allowable harvest in pounds. Written notice will be sent to all permitted\nfishers and to dealers known to handle striped bass prior to the closure of the\ncommercial striped bass fishery. (7)\n\nThe department shall subtract any\noverharvest which exceeds the commercial harvest cap from the following year's\nharvest cap. (8)\n\nPermits. (i) It is unlawful for any person to take\nstriped bass for commercial purposes without having in possession a valid\nstriped bass commercial permit. The department may permit a one-time reissuance\nof a striped bass commercial harvesters permit pursuant to the provisions of\nthe Environmental Conservation Law, section 13-0328(6). Upon reissuance, the\nformer holder of such permit shall waive eligibility for striped bass\ncommercial harvesters permits, and all rights and responsibilities associated\nwith such permit shall pass to the recipient of such reissued permit. (ii)\n\nPermits to take a full quota share of\nstriped bass will be issued at no cost to persons who currently possess a valid\n\nNew York State commercial food fish license and who previously held a New York\n\nState license to sell striped bass during 1984, 1985, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995 and who can demonstrate through Federal or New York State income\ntax records that 50 percent or more of his or her earned income resulted from\nhis or her direct participation in the harvest of marine fish, shellfish, crustaceans or other marine biota in any one year during the period 1994\nthrough 2004. A complete copy of such tax record must be filed with the\ndepartment upon application. (iii)\n\nPermits to take a partial quota share of striped bass will be issued at no cost\nto persons who currently possess a valid New York State commercial food fish\nlicense and who previously held a New York State license to sell striped bass\nduring 1984, 1985, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995 but who cannot\ndemonstrate that they earned 50 percent or more of their earned income from the\ndirect participation in the harvest of marine fish, shellfish, crustaceans or\nother marine biota. (iv)\n\nAny holder\nof a partial share permit may apply for a full share permit by demonstrating\nthrough Federal or State tax records that 50 percent or more of his or her\nearned income has been derived from the direct participation in the harvest of\nmarine fish, shellfish, crustaceans or other marine biota during the preceding\nyear. (v) Beginning in 2005, and\ncontinuing at five year intervals, each striped bass commercial harvesters\npermit holder in the full share category must file with the department a\ncomplete copy of his or her federal or state income tax records from one of the\npreceding three years. Such tax records must be filed before the June 1\ndeadline for receipt of applications. Such tax records must demonstrate that\nthe permit holder has, as stated in subparagraph (ii) above, maintained the 50\npercent earned income level in order to remain a participant in the full share\ncategory. Failure to file a timely and complete copy of federal or state income\ntax records which demonstrate that the permit holder has maintained the 50\npercent earned income level will result in the permit holder being placed into\nthe partial share category. Thereafter, the rules pertaining to partial share\npermit holders provided in subparagraph (iv) above apply. This requirement\nshall be suspended in 2015, until either reinstituted upon notification by the\ndepartment or replaced with an alternate system of determining shares and\nqualifications for shares. (9)\n\nApplications for striped bass commercial\nharvesters permits will be accepted until close of business April 15. Any\napplication for a striped bass commercial harvesters permit received after\nclose of business April 15 will not be entertained by the department. (10)\n\nIt is unlawful for any person to\ntransfer or assign striped bass commercial permits or tags provided with such\npermit to another person. It is unlawful for any person to possess striped bass\ntags which were issued to another permit holder. It is unlawful for any person\nto possess striped bass bearing unlawfully transferred striped bass tags issued\nto another permit holder. (11)\n\nCommercial tags and tagging. The department will issue serialized tags to\npermitted fishers. Tags will be issued in two categories, full share and\npartial share holders. A full share of the tags will be issued to those fishers\nwho are the holders of a full share permit; and a partial share of the tags\nwill be issued to the holders of a partial share permit. Individual tag\nallocations for all permit holders are achieved by first dividing New York's\ncommercial striped bass quota by all eligible permit holders. A partial share\npermit holder receives 20 percent of this individual allocation. The full share\nindividual quota is derived by subtracting the partial share quota from the\ntotal and dividing by the number of full share permit holders to achieve the\nindividual full share allocation. (12)\n\nTags will be issued in equal numbers to\neach participant within each category described in paragraph (11) of this\nsubdivision. (13)\n\nEach permittee\nwill be provided, in batches, a number of tags equal to their individual quota. A permittee will be required to pay a fee per tag issued to them. The\ndepartment will advise permit holders of the fee per tag each year when\ncommercial tag order forms are distributed. The fee for tags must be paid in\nfull before the permittee receives their tag allocation for the current year. No refunds or replacements will be made for tags which are lost, broken, confiscated or unused. (14)\n\nOnce a\npermittee's allocation of tags are used, he or she may not take striped bass\nfor commercial purposes. (15)\n\nIt is\nunlawful to sell or offer for sale untagged striped bass or striped bass\nfillets or steaks unless the tagged carcass from which such fillets or steaks\nwere removed is present and available for inspection. Possession of untagged\nstriped bass or striped bass fillets or steaks without the properly tagged\ncarcass in establishments where fish are sold or offered for sale (including\nwholesale establishments, retail establishments and restaurants) is presumptive\nevidence of intent to sell, trade or barter such striped bass. (16)\n\nIt is unlawful to reuse or alter any\nstriped bass tag. Any permittee losing tags must report such loss to the\ndepartment on their weekly reports. (17)\nA striped bass commercial permittee who\ntakes and possesses a striped bass of legal commercial slot size shall\nimmediately attach and securely lock into place through the mouth and gill a\nnumbered strap tag issued by the department immediately after removing said\nstriped bass from their gear and prior to attending another piece of gear. All\nstriped bass not of legal commercial slot size shall be returned to the water\nimmediately without unnecessary injury. Possession of striped bass not tagged\nas required by this subdivision is prohibited. (18)\n\nIt is unlawful to sell striped bass\nwhich are not properly tagged, as described in paragraph (17) of this\nsubdivision. Retail markets may prepare portions of legally tagged striped bass\nfor the consumer and must retain the tagged carcass until all portions are\nsold. The tag must then be removed from the rack and then destroyed by cutting\nthe tag in two. (19)\n\nIt is unlawful\nfor any person to possess striped bass tags or tagged striped bass in the\nmarine and coastal district and the shores thereof west of a line drawn due\nnorth from the mouth of Wading River Creek and west of a line at 73 degrees 46\nminutes west longitude, which is near the terminus of East Rockaway Inlet. The\nclosed area includes Jamaica Bay and all tributaries. (20)\n\nReporting requirements. Reporting\nrequirements. (i) Fishing vessel trip\nreports. Any person who is a holder of a striped bass commercial permit shall\ncomplete and submit an accurate fishing vessel trip report for each commercial\nfishing trip, detailing all fishing activities and all species landed, pursuant\nto paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Fishing vessel trip reports shall be\ncompleted, signed, and submitted to the department for each month; if no\nfishing trips were made for striped bass during a month, a report must be\nsubmitted for that month stating no striped bass trips were made. Permit\nholders who operate or who fish from a federally permitted vessel and take\nstriped bass must submit the federal trip information to the department for\neach trip. This trip information includes but is not limited to the permit\nholder's permit number, the federal trip identification number, the number of\ntags used, the amount of striped bass landed (in pounds), disposition of\nstriped bass, gear type, and tag serial numbers. This information must be\nreported on a form approved by the department. Permit holders must submit the\nlast report five days after the close of the commercial striped bass season or\nwithin five days after all striped bass tags are used. Permit holders must\nsubmit all required information, including, but not limited to, the name of the\nvessel, the permit number(s), trip type, all species taken, the striped bass\ntag serial numbers used for the trip, the weight (in pounds), and number of\nstriped bass taken, the name and signature of the permit holder, and the date\nsigned. All reports must be complete. Incomplete fishing vessel trip reports or\nunsigned reports will not satisfy these reporting requirements and may be\nreturned to the permit holder who submitted them for completion. Once\ncommercial striped bass permit holders have reported 100 percent use of the\nindividual allocation of tags, they are no longer required to submit reports\nfor striped bass. Permit holders who fail to submit acceptable fishing vessel\ntrip reports to the department may be denied future commercial striped bass\nfishing permits pursuant to Part 175 of this Title. (ii)\n\nStriped bass tags. All striped bass\ncommercial permit holders must return any unused tags to the department by\n\nDecember 20th of the year the tags were issued. Permit holders who fail to\nreturn unused tags may be denied future commercial striped bass fishing permits\npursuant to Part 175 of this Title. Permit holders who fail to accurately\naccount for all tags may receive a reduction in the number of tags allocated in\nthe next fishing season in which the permit holder applies for a striped bass\ncommercial permit. This reduction in tags will be equal to the number of tags\nnot accounted for in the previous fishing season. (21)\n\nManner of taking. Striped bass may be\ntaken for commercial purposes by using any of the following gear types only: hook and line, pound net, trap net, gill net as specified in section\n40.5\n(e) of this\n\nPart, or as by-catch in otter trawls. Permit holders may use any of the legal\ngears to catch their individual allocation of striped bass. Otter trawl\nby-catch is limited to 21 striped bass per vessel per trip and shall be\nseparately boxed. All other types of gear are prohibited for use in taking\nstriped bass, including but not limited to: haul seines and spears. (22)\n\nNo person shall possess striped bass or\nstriped bass tags while in possession of a seine. (23)\n\nSpecial permits. The department may\npermit the sale of striped bass taken in another state provided that (i) the\n\nDepartment of Health certifies, based on sampling and analysis provided by such\nstate, that such striped bass meet all standards for sale of fish in this\n\nState, (ii) such striped bass are of a size within the New York State slot size\nlimit, (iii) such striped bass are tagged with serially numbered tags provided\nby the state of origin, and (iv) such state authorizes sale within its borders\nof striped bass taken in New York. Nothing in this section is deemed to\nprohibit the lawful transportation through the state of striped bass lawfully\ntaken from waters outside the state to other states, provided that such fish\nare in their original unopened container and written documentation of their\norigin and destination accompanies such container. (24)\n\nThe department may authorize the sale of\nstriped bass from marine hatcheries or off bottom culture facilities permitted\npursuant to Part 48 of this Title. (25)\n\nThe department may permit the\nimportation and sale of striped bass hybrids or striped bass from aquaculture\nfacilities outside of New York State provided that the facility or jurisdiction\nwithin which such facility is located provides for hybrid striped bass\ndocumentation as to the origin of these fish in a manner acceptable to the\ndepartment and for striped bass said documentation as well as individual\ntagging acceptable to the department. (k) Atlantic sturgeon commercial\nfishing-special regulations. (1)\n\nAny\n\nAtlantic sturgeon inadvertently taken in New York must be returned to the water\nimmediately without unnecessary injury. (2)\n\nIt is unlawful for any person to sell, import, traffic in or possess Atlantic sturgeon or Atlantic sturgeon products\nin New York. (3)\n\nAny person\nviolating any provision of these regulations may be subject to license\nrevocation as provided in Part 175 of this Title. (l) Summer flounder (fluke) commercial\nfishing-special regulations. (1)\n\nThe\ntotal annual harvest of summer flounder for the period January 1st through\n\nDecember 31st, is the amount allocated annually to New York State by the\n\nNational Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the United States Department of\n\nCommerce and/or the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission\n(ASMFC). (2)\n\nFollowing consultation\nwith the commercial fishing industry, the department may establish quota\nperiods, allocations for quota periods, trip limits, and directed fishery\nthresholds for summer flounder, pursuant to subdivision (u) of this section, consistent with the annual allocation (quota) assigned to New York such that\nharvest does not exceed such quota. (3)\n\nWhen the department determines, based on\na projection of any period's landings using the United States Department of\n\nCommerce, National Marine Fisheries Service's weekly dealer reports, that trip\nlimits are necessary as provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, such\ntrip limits will be required and enforceable upon 72 hours written notice to\npermit holders of the appropriate limit allowed per vessel for the specified\npermitted gear category for that time period. Such trip limits may be further\nreduced by written direction of the department if the projection of the\nlandings indicates a closure will be required before the end of the period. In\nany month the trip limits may be increased if the projection of the landings\nindicates the period's total quota will not be caught. During periods of trip\nlimits, all summer flounder not being held alive must be held together in a\nseparate container or containers readily available for inspection and may not\nbe mixed with other species while on board any vessel. (4)\n\nIf the department determines that the\nmaximum allowable harvest of summer flounder for any time period established\npursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision will have been reached\nbefore the end of that period, harvesting for commercial purposes and\npossession of summer flounder shall be prohibited for all permit holders except\nas permitted in paragraph (5) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nIf the department closes the summer\nflounder fishery at any time between May 1st and October 31st, the harvesting\nand possession of summer flounder for commercial purposes shall be prohibited\nfor all permit holders except for holders of fixed gear category summer\nflounder permits. Fixed gear category permit holders may harvest up to a limit\nof 100 pounds per trip during harvest closures that occur between May 1st and\n\nOctober 31st. (6)\n\nExcept as\npermitted in subdivision (e) of this section, 14 days following the beginning\nof any period when all commercial harvesting is prohibited, it is unlawful to\npossess summer flounder for sale, or offer summer flounder for sale, trade or\nbarter during the period January 1st through April 30th and November 1st\nthrough December 31st and it is unlawful to sell or offer for sale, trade or\nbarter summer flounder taken by gear other than fixed gear during the period\n\nMay 1st through October 31st unless such summer flounder are separately boxed\nand properly tagged pursuant to the procedure set forth in subdivision (e) of\nthis section. (7)\n\nIt is unlawful\nfor any person to take summer flounder for commercial purposes without having\nin possession a summer flounder commercial permit. If the applicant for permit\nis a corporation, such application must name a specific vessel and a separate\npermit must be obtained for each vessel fishing owned by the corporation. Such\ncorporate permits must be carried on the specific vessel named in the permit\nwhen that vessel is being used to take summer flounder for commercial purposes. For purposes of this subdivision, a person is presumed to be taking summer\nflounder for commercial purposes when that person possesses more summer\nflounder than the possession limit indicated in Table A of this section. A\npermit to take summer flounder will be issued at no cost to any person who\nmeets the following criteria: (i) currently\npossesses a valid New York State commercial food fish license and previously\nheld a New York State commercial food fish license during 1992 or any\nsubsequent year; and\n(a) previously held a\nsummer flounder commercial permit; or\n(b) has on file with the department a 1994\nsummer flounder commercial permit application that was received prior to close\nof business on April 15, 1994; and\n(c) (with respect to calendar year 1995 only)\nheld a 1994 New York State commercial food fish license, and for whom the\ndepartment finds that, based on advice received from the department in 1994, with respect to future requirements for summer flounder commercial permits, which advice subsequently proved to be affected by changes to eligibility\nrequirements, the applicant relied upon such advice and either failed to apply\nfor a permit or made an investment under the expectation that such a permit\nwould be issued; and\n(ii)\ncan demonstrate through Federal or New York State tax records that 50 percent\nor more of his or her earned income during any one year in the period January\n1988 to December 1992 or any subsequent year resulted from his or her direct\nparticipation in the harvest of marine fish, shellfish, crustacea or other\nmarine biota. For purposes of this subdivision, earned income\nis defined as income derived from labor, professional service, or\nentrepreneurship as opposed to income derived from invested capital, retirement\npay or pensions. (8)\n\nApplications for a summer flounder commercial permit will be accepted from\n\nNovember 15th until close of business April 15th. Any application received\nafter close of business April 15th will not be entertained. Incomplete\napplications received before close of business April 15th must be completed no\nlater than close of business May 15th in order to be issued. No permit will be\nissued after May 15th. Applications arriving or remaining incomplete after that\ndate will be returned without action. (9)\n\nPermittees must state and affirm on the\napplication form designed and provided by the department their name, address, commercial food fish license number, their intent to be permitted to use only\nfixed gear (pound/trap net), only hook and line gear or for the use of all\ngear. The commercial permit thereafter issued will authorize landings for that\nentire calendar year from that category of gear only and it will be unlawful to\ntake summer flounder with gear other than that designated on the permit. Unless\nat least 50 permit holders select the hook and line gear category, there will\nnot be a separate allocation of summer flounder reserved for those permit\nholders and they will then fish under the requirements for the all gear\ncategory. (10)\n\nIt is unlawful for\nany person to land summer flounder for commercial purposes without having in\npossession a summer flounder commercial permit or a summer flounder landing\npermit provided by the department upon application on the form provided by the\ndepartment. If the applicant for a permit is a corporation, such application\nmust name a specific vessel and a separate permit must be obtained for each\nvessel owned by that corporation. Such corporate permits must be carried on the\nspecific vessel named in the permit when that vessel is being used to land\nsummer flounder for commercial purposes. A landing permit will be issued at no\ncost to any person who meets the following criteria: (i) currently possesses a valid New York\n\nState food fish landing license and previously held a New York State commercial\nfood fish landing license during 1992 or any subsequent year; and\n(a) previously held a summer flounder\ncommercial permit or a summer flounder landing permit; or\n(b) has on file with the department a 1994\nsummer flounder commercial permit application or summer flounder landing permit\napplication received prior to close of business on April 15, 1994; and\n(ii)\ncan demonstrate\nthrough Federal or New York State tax records that 50 percent or more of his or\nher earned income during any one year in the period January 1988 to December\n1992 or any subsequent year resulted from his or her direct participation in\nthe harvest of marine fish, shellfish, crustacea or other marine biota. For\npurposes of this subdivision, earned income\nis defined as\nincome derived from labor, professional service, or entrepreneurship as opposed\nto income derived from invested capital, retirement pay or pensions. Such\nsummer flounder landing permits will be issued from January 1st until close of\nbusiness April 15th each year. (11)\n\nPermits issued under this subdivision\nwill be nontransferable except the department may permit a one-time reissuance\nof a summer flounder commercial harvesters permit pursuant to the provisions of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law, section 13-0328(6). Upon reissuance, the former\nholder of such permit will waive eligibility for summer flounder commercial\nharvesters permits and all rights and responsibilities associated with such\npermit shall pass to the recipient of such reissued permit. Summer flounder\ncommercial permits will expire on the last day of December of each\nyear. (12)\n\nPermit modification, suspension or revocation will be pursuant to Part 175 of this Title. (13)\n\nThe possession of summer flounder for\ncommercial purposes from which the head or tail have been removed or that have\nbeen otherwise cleaned, cut, filleted, or skinned so that the total length or\nidentity cannot be determined, and which are not in properly labeled containers\nas required by subdivision (e) of this section, is prohibited unless such\nsummer flounder are in a wholesale or retail establishment or restaurant for\nsale to the consumer. (14)\n\nNo\nperson may commercially harvest, sell, offer for sale, trade or barter or\npossess summer flounder except in compliance with this subdivision. (15)\n\nThe department may, under mutual\nagreement with another state and with the concurrence of the Regional\n\nAdministrator of the Northeast Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, transfer summer flounder quota to that state or combine the summer flounder\nquota from that state with the New York quota. (16)\n\nAny holder of a New York commercial food\nfish license who is the owner or operator of a fishing vessel not holding a\n\nFederal Fisheries Permit for summer flounder issued by the United States\n\nDepartment of Commerce must complete a daily fishing log supplied by the\n\nRegional Administrator of the National Marine Fisheries Service, Northeast\n\nRegion. Failure to complete a log may result in a denial of a future\napplication for a summer flounder permit. (17)\n\nAll persons who hold a summer flounder\ncommercial hook and line permit shall file an accurate weekly report on all\nsummer flounder harvesting activities on the State copy of the fishing vessel\ntrip report forms as required in subdivision (c) of this section, whether or\nnot any summer flounder were actually taken. The State copies of the fishing\nvessel trip report for a given week will be due to the department on a weekly\nbasis, within five days following the Saturday of each week. Failure to\ncomplete and file an acceptable weekly report with the department may result in\na denial of a future application for a summer flounder\npermit. (m) Bluefish commercial fishing-special regulations. (1)\n\nThe total annual harvest of bluefish may\nnot exceed that amount annually allocated to New York State by the National\n\nMarine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the United States Department of Commerce\nand/or the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) for the period\n\nJanuary 1st through December 31st. (2)\n\nFollowing consultation with industry, the\ndepartment may establish quota periods, trip limits and directed fishery\nthresholds such that the harvest does not exceed the quota assigned to New\n\nYork. (3)\n\nWhen the department\ndetermines, based on a projection of landings using the United States\n\nDepartment of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service's weekly dealer\nreports, that trip limits are necessary as provided in Table B of subdivision\n(i) of this section, such trip limits will be required and enforceable upon 72\nhours written notice to license holders of the appropriate limit allowed per\nvessel for that time period. Such trip limits may be further reduced by written\ndirection of the department if the projection of the landings indicates a\nclosure will be required before the end of the period. In any month the trip\nlimits may be increased if the projection of the landings indicates the total\nquota will not be caught. (4)\n\nDuring periods of trip limits, all bluefish must be held together in a separate\ncontainer or containers readily available for inspection and may not be mixed\nwith other species while on board any vessel. (5)\n\nIf the department determines that the\nmaximum allowable harvest of bluefish will have taken place before the end of\nthat period, harvesting for commercial purposes and possession of bluefish will\nbe prohibited for all license holders as directed by the department upon 72\nhours written notice to commercial food fish license holders. (6)\n\nFourteen days following the beginning of\nany period when all commercial harvesting is prohibited, it shall be unlawful\nto possess bluefish for sale, or offer bluefish for sale, trade or barter, except as permitted in subdivision (e) of this section. (7)\n\nIt is unlawful for any person to take\nbluefish for commercial purposes without having in possession a valid New York\n\nState commercial food fish license. For purposes of this subdivision, a person\nis presumed to be taking bluefish for commercial purposes when that person\npossesses more bluefish than the possession limit indicated in Table A of\nsubdivision (f) of this section. (8)\n\nThe possession of bluefish for commercial\npurposes from which the head or tail have been removed or otherwise cleaned, cut, filleted, or skinned so that the total length or identity cannot be\ndetermined and which are not in containers tagged as required by subdivision\n(e) of this section is prohibited unless such bluefish are in a wholesale or\nretail establishment or restaurant for sale to the consumer. (9)\n\nNo person may commercially harvest, sell, offer for sale, trade or barter or possess bluefish except in compliance with\nthis subdivision. (10)\n\nThe use of\npair trawls, two boat trawls or paranzella nets for the taking of bluefish is\nprohibited. The possession or landing of bluefish from any vessel having aboard\na pair trawl, two boat trawl or paranzella net is also prohibited. (11)\n\nThe department may, under mutual\nagreement with another state and with the concurrence of the Regional\n\nAdministrator of the Northeast Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, transfer bluefish quota to that state or combine the bluefish quota from that\nstate with the New York quota. (12)\n\nAny holder of a New York commercial food fish license who is the owner or\noperator of a fishing vessel not holding a Federal fisheries permit for\nbluefish issued by the United States Department of Commerce must complete a\ndaily fishing log supplied by the Regional Administrator of the National Marine\n\nFisheries Service, Northeast Region. Failure to complete a log may result in a\ndenial of future participation in the bluefish fishery. (n) Winter flounder commercial\nfishing-special regulations. (1)\n\nThe\nuse of a gill or trammel net for the taking of winter flounder is\nprohibited. (2)\n\nWinter flounder\nlegally harvested from waters outside the State may be possessed on board\nvessels transiting State waters, and may be landed in New York at any time. Persons on such vessels may not fish for winter flounder in State waters or\npossess winter flounder while fishing in State waters with those gear types\nseasonally prohibited under Table B of this section. (o) Tautog commercial fishing-special\nregulations. (1)\n\nIt shall be unlawful\nto take or land tautog from any boat or vessel for commercial purposes in\nexcess of the commercial possession limit regardless of the number of\ncommercial license holders aboard such boat or vessel. (2)\n\nNo individual may place tautog in storage\nin the waters of the marine and coastal district in excess of the recreational\npossession limit unless he or she is the holder of a commercial license issued\npursuant to section\n13-0335\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law (food fish license). (3)\n\nAny containers, pens or live cars placed\nin the waters of the marine and coastal district to store tautog for commercial\npurposes must be clearly labeled and have visible on the top of such container, pen or live car the name and food fish license number of the person responsible\nfor the fish stored within such containers, pens or live cars. (4)\n\nNo individual may possess tautog in\nstorage in the waters of the marine and coastal district in excess of the\ncommercial possession limit unless the individual submits trip reports for all\nlive stored tautog, as specified in subparagraph (5)(iv) of this subdivision, to the department within twenty-four hours of landing. Individuals must retain\ncopies of submitted trip reports for inspection onboard their vessel during the\ntagging season. (5)\n\nCommercial\n\nTagging Requirements. (i) All commercially\nharvested tautog must be tagged with a single-use serialized tag as specified\nby the department. Only tags issued for the tautog tagging season in which the\nfish was harvested may be applied to tautog. Tags must be applied to one of the\ntautog's gill plates with the tag information visible on the outside of the\nfish. Tags must be applied prior to any commercially harvested species from the\ntrip being offloaded or transferred to shore, to another vessel, to an in-water\nstorage unit, or to any pier, wharf, dock or similar structure. (ii)\n\nPossession of a valid food fish license, issued pursuant to section\n13-0335\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law, is required to be eligible to order tags. A tag order must be\nsubmitted and approved by the department before any tags can be issued. The\nlicense holder may be required to pay a fee not to exceed 35 cents per tag\nissued to the license holder. Any required fee for the tags must be paid in\nfull before tags will be issued to the license holder. No refunds or\nreplacements will be made for tags which are lost, damaged, returned, confiscated, or stolen. After the license holder's initial tag order, the\nlicense holder must account for eighty percent of the tags the license holder\nhas been issued during the current tagging season before the license holder's\nnext tag order can be approved. Tags must be accounted for through trip reports\nor damaged tags returned to the department. Failure to account for over twenty\npercent of the tags issued to the license holder during the current tagging\nseason will result in the department denying any additional tag orders for the\ncurrent tagging season. A license holder whose tag order has been denied may\nsubmit an excessive loss application, on a form provided by the department, for\nthe opportunity to receive one additional tag order during that tagging\nseason. (iii)\n\nThe maximum number of\ntags that may be issued in a single tag order is the highest historical number\nof tautog reported as landed in one calendar year by the license holder during\none of the previous three calendar years immediately preceding the year of\nissue. For purposes of determining the amount of reported landings, only the\nfollowing documented landings will be counted: landings submitted to the\ndepartment through state vessel trip reports, federal vessel trip reports, and\nlandings submitted electronically through the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative\n\nStatistics Program. A license holder who is unable to document a history of\ntautog landings in one of the three calendar years immediately preceding the\nyear of issue, is eligible to submit one tag order per business week for a\nmaximum of 50 tags per tag order. (iv)\n\nIn addition to the trip reporting\nrequirements in subdivision\n40.1\n(c), food fish\nlicense holders harvesting tautog must also include the following information\nin their trip reports: the tautog tag serial numbers used for the trip, the\nweight of the tautog (in pounds), and the number of tautog taken. License\nholders who operate federally permitted vessels and harvest tautog must\ncomplete and submit the State copy of their fishing vessel trip report (NOAA\nForm No. 88-30) to the department for each commercial tautog trip. License\nholders must submit their final tautog report, along with the NY Tautog Tag\n\nAccounting Form, by February 15 for the previous tagging season. License\nholders who fail to submit complete and accurate reports to the department by\n\nFebruary 15 may not be eligible to receive tautog tags for the following\ntagging season. (v) It is unlawful\nto reuse or alter any tautog tag. Any license holder who loses tags must report\nthe loss to the department on their fishing reports or through a form provided\nby the department within twenty-four hours. Tautog tags are non-transferable, and it is unlawful for any person to possess tautog tags issued to another\nlicense holder, except as a designated agent to pick up and deliver a tag order\nfrom the department. At no time may a designated agent be in possession of\nanother license holder's tags while onboard a vessel or in possession of\ntautog. (vi)\n\nAll food fish license\nholders who are issued tautog tags must return any unused or damaged tags to\nthe department by February 15 after the tagging season for which they were\nissued. A license holder who fails to return unused tags may not be eligible to\nreceive tautog tags for the following tagging season. (vii)\n\nIt is unlawful to sell, or offer for\nsale, untagged whole tautog. It is unlawful to sell, or offer for sale, tautog fillets\nor parts unless the tagged carcass from which such fillets or parts were\nremoved is present and available for inspection. Possession of untagged tautog, or tautog fillets or parts without the properly tagged carcass, in\nestablishments where fish are sold or offered for sale (including wholesale\nestablishments, retail establishments, and restaurants) is presumptive evidence\nof the intent to sell, trade, or barter such tautog. All New York harvested\ntautog which are tagged during the tautog tagging season may be offered for\nsale, trade, or barter through March 15. After March 15, tautog tagged during\nthe previous tautog tagging season must not be offered for sale, trade or\nbarter. (viii)\n\nTautog\nlegally harvested from other states, that are tagged with serially numbered\ntags provided by the state of origin, may be sold or offered for sale if the\ntautog meets all applicable provisions of the Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw.

(q) Weakfish\ncommercial fishing-special regulations. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision, weakfish may only be sold, traded, bartered, offered for\nsale, or transported in New York during the open season, or within two weeks\nfollowing the close of the season. (2)\n\nPersons authorized by Table B may sell\nduring any period where there is a closure for weakfish lawfully taken and\nlanded provided that the fish are in boxes closed and sealed and the boxes are\nmarked with a tag at least two inches wide and four inches long of substantial, water-resistant material. Such tag must indicate clearly the state of origin, the shippers name, location landed, and the date landed. Weakfish lawfully\ntaken and landed in other states may be shipped into New York for trade, or\nsale during any closure, provided that they meet the tagging requirements above\nand that: (i) such weakfish meet the minimum\ntotal length, fillet or dressed length requirement for this species; and\n(ii)\nsuch state authorizes\nreciprocal privileges within its borders for weakfish taken in New\n\nYork. (3)\n\nNothing in this\nsubdivision shall prohibit the lawful transportation through the State of\nweakfish lawfully taken from waters outside the State to other states, provided\nthat such fish are in their original unopened container and written\ndocumentation of their origin and destination accompanies such\ncontainer. (4)\n\nExcept during the\nopen season, it is unlawful for any person to land or possess on the waters of\nthe marine district, weakfish from which the head or tail have been removed or\nthat have been otherwise cleaned, cut, filleted, or skinned so that the total\nlength or identify cannot be determined. (5)\n\nThe use of pair trawls, two boat trawls\nor paranzella nets for the taking of weakfish is prohibited. The landing of\nweakfish from any vessel having aboard a pair trawl, two boat trawl or\nparanzella net is also prohibited. (r) Scup commercial fishing-special\nregulations. (1)\n\nThe total annual\nharvest of scup may not exceed that amount annually allocated to New York State\nby the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the U.S. Department of\n\nCommerce and/or the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission for the period\n\nMay 1st through October 31st. Harvest limits for scup are based on the fishery\nmanagement plan (FMP) for scup as adopted and approved by the Atlantic States\n\nMarine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) and the Regional Fishery Management Council\npursuant to the Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. section\n1801, et seq. and the\n\nAtlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act, 16 U.S.C. section\n5101, et seq. (2)\n\nQuotas, trip limits and directed fishery\nthresholds for the periods of January 1st to April 30th and November 1st to\n\nDecember 31st will be established by NMFS. The department will establish trip\nlimits and directed fishery thresholds within the periods of January 1st to\n\nApril 30th and November 1st to December 31st consistent with those established\nby NMFS. Trip limits and directed fishery thresholds will be established for\nthe period of May 1st to October 31st such that the harvest in this period does\nnot exceed the quota assigned to New York by NMFS and/or the Atlantic States\n\nMarine Fisheries Commission. The department may establish trip limits within\nthe period of May 1st to October 31st annually, based upon projected landings, and the FMP, following consultation with industry and appropriate notice to\nindividual fishermen. (3)\n\nWhen the\ndepartment determines during the period of May 1st to October 31st, based on a\nprojection of any period's landings using the NMFS weekly dealer reports, that\nadjustment of a trip limit is necessary as provided in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, such trip limits will be adjusted, and will be enforceable upon 72\nhours written notice to license holders of the trip limit allowed per vessel\nfor that time period. Such trip limits may be further reduced by written\ndirection of the department if the projection of the landings indicates a\nclosure will be required before the end of the period. In the period of May 1st\nto October 31st the trip limit may be increased if the projection of the\nlandings indicates that period's total quota will not be caught. During periods\nof trip limits all scup not being held alive must be held together in a\nseparate container or containers readily available for inspection and may not\nbe mixed with other species while on board any vessel. (4)\n\nIf the department determines that the\nmaximum allowable harvest of scup will have taken place in the time periods of\n\nJanuary 1st to April 30th or November 1st to December 31st, harvesting for\ncommercial purposes and possession of scup will be prohibited for all license\nholders during the remainder of the period. If the department determines that\nthe maximum allowable harvest for scup will have taken place in the time period\nof May 1st to October 31st, harvesting for commercial purposes and possession\nof scup will be prohibited for all license holders except for holders of a\nsummer flounder fixed gear permit (pound net/trap net only) as directed by the\ndepartment upon 72 hours written notice to license holders. (5)\n\nIf the department closes the period, but\nunanticipated events result in the quota not being landed by the projected date\nand at least one month remains in the time period, then the department may\nreopen the period for a specified time and a specified trip limit up to the\nmaximum allowed for that period upon 72 hours written notice to permit holders. If less than one month remains in the time period, the remaining quota\navailable from that period will be added to the next open period in the same\nyear. (6)\n\nFourteen days following\nthe beginning of any period when commercial harvesting is prohibited, it shall\nbe unlawful to possess scup for sale, or offer scup for sale, trade or barter\nexcept scup taken by gear other than fixed gear during the period of May 1st to\n\nOctober 31st and as provided for in subdivision (e) of this section. (7)\n\nIt is unlawful for any person to take\nscup for commercial purposes without having in possession a valid New York\n\nState commercial food fish license. (8)\n\nThe department may, under mutual\nagreement with another state and with the concurrence of the Regional\n\nAdministrator of the Northeast Region, National Marine Fisheries Service or the\n\nAtlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, transfer scup quota to that state\nor combine the scup quota from that state with the New York quota. (s) Black sea bass\ncommercial fishing-special regulations. (1)\n\nPermits. Permits. It is unlawful for any person to take or land black sea\nbass for commercial purposes without having in possession a valid New York\n\nState resident or non-resident commercial food fish license.

(2)\n\nQuota harvest and trip limits. Quota\nharvest and trip limits. (i) The total annual\nharvest of black sea bass may not exceed that amount annually allocated to New\n\nYork State by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the United States\n\nDepartment of Commerce and/or the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission\n(ASMFC) for the period January 1st through December 31st. Annual harvest limits\nfor black sea bass are based on the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for black sea\nbass as adopted and approved by the Atlantic State Marine Fisheries Commission\n(ASMFC) and the Regional Fishery Management Council pursuant to the Fishery\n\nConservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C., section\n1801, et seq. and the\n\nAtlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act, 16 U.S.C., section\n5101, et seq. (ii)\n\nFollowing consultation with industry, the department may establish quota periods, trip limits and directed fishery\nthresholds such that the harvest does not exceed the quota assigned to New\n\nYork. (iii)\n\nWhen the department\ndetermines, based on a projection of landings using the United States\n\nDepartment of Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service's weekly dealer\nreports, that trip limits are necessary as provided in Table B of subdivision\n(i) of this section, such trip limits will be required and enforceable upon 72\nhours' written notice to license holders of the appropriate limit allowed per\nvessel for that time period. Such trip limits may be further reduced by written\ndirection of the department if the projection of the landings indicates a\nclosure will be required before the end of the period. In any month, the trip\nlimits may be increased if the projection of the landings indicates the total\nquota will not be caught.

(4)\n\nIt is unlawful for any\nperson\nto take or possess striped bass for commercial purposes on any charter vessel, open boat or any other vessel while carrying passengers for hire for the purpose of fishing. All persons on such vessel carrying passengers for hire for the purpose of fishing must comply with Table A of this section and any special\nregulations\nand shall not possess striped bass tags or tagged striped bass. (5)\n\nConviction for or civil settlement of a violation of any provision of subdivision (d) or (g) of this section may disqualify the convicted or settling\nperson\nfrom receiving future striped bass permits pursuant to Part 175\nof this Title. (6)\n\nThe\ndepartment\nmay close the commercial fishery for striped bass when the harvest is projected, based upon weekly reports and independent monitoring of the commercial fishery, to exceed the total allowable harvest in pounds. Written notice will be sent to all permitted fishers and to dealers known to handle striped bass prior to the closure of the commercial striped bass fishery. (7)\n\nThe\ndepartment\nshall subtract any overharvest which exceeds the commercial harvest cap from the following year's harvest cap. (8)\n\nPermits. (i) It is unlawful for any\nperson\nto take striped bass for commercial purposes without having in possession a valid striped bass commercial permit. The\ndepartment\nmay permit a one-time reissuance of a striped bass commercial harvesters permit pursuant to the provisions of the Environmental Conservation Law, section 13-0328(6). Upon reissuance, the former holder of such permit shall waive eligibility for striped bass commercial harvesters permits, and all rights and responsibilities associated with such permit shall pass to the recipient of such reissued permit. (ii)\n\nPermits to take a full quota share of striped bass will be issued at no cost to persons who currently possess a valid New York State commercial food fish license and who previously held a New York State license to sell striped bass during 1984, 1985, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995 and who can demonstrate through Federal or New York State income tax records that 50 percent or more of his or her earned income resulted from his or her direct participation in the harvest of marine fish, shellfish, crustaceans or other marine biota in any one year during the period 1994 through 2004. A complete copy of such tax record must be filed with the\ndepartment\nupon application. (iii)\n\nPermits to take a partial quota share of striped bass will be issued at no cost to persons who currently possess a valid New York State commercial food fish license and who previously held a New York State license to sell striped bass during 1984, 1985, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995 but who cannot demonstrate that they earned 50 percent or more of their earned income from the direct participation in the harvest of marine fish, shellfish, crustaceans or other marine biota. (iv)\n\nAny holder of a partial share permit may apply for a full share permit by demonstrating through Federal or State tax records that 50 percent or more of his or her earned income has been derived from the direct participation in the harvest of marine fish, shellfish, crustaceans or other marine biota during the preceding year. (v) Beginning in 2005, and continuing at five year intervals, each striped bass commercial harvesters permit holder in the full share category must file with the\ndepartment\na complete copy of his or her federal or state income tax records from one of the preceding three years. Such tax records must be filed before the June 1 deadline for\nreceipt\nof applications. Such tax records must demonstrate that the permit holder has, as stated in subparagraph (ii) above, maintained the 50 percent earned income level in order to remain a participant in the full share category. Failure to file a timely and complete copy of federal or state income tax records which demonstrate that the permit holder has maintained the 50 percent earned income level will result in the permit holder being placed into the partial share category. Thereafter, the rules pertaining to partial share permit holders provided in subparagraph (iv) above apply. This requirement shall be suspended in 2015, until either reinstituted upon notification by the\ndepartment\nor replaced with an alternate system of determining shares and qualifications for shares. (9)\n\nApplications for striped bass commercial harvesters permits will be accepted until close of business April 15. Any application for a striped bass commercial harvesters permit received after close of business April 15 will not be entertained by the\ndepartment. (10)\n\nIt is unlawful for any\nperson\nto transfer or assign striped bass commercial permits or tags provided with such permit to another\nperson. It is unlawful for any\nperson\nto possess striped bass tags which were issued to another permit holder. It is unlawful for any\nperson\nto possess striped bass bearing unlawfully transferred striped bass tags issued to another permit holder. (11)\n\nCommercial tags and tagging. The\ndepartment\nwill issue serialized tags to permitted fishers. Tags will be issued in two categories, full share and partial share holders. A full share of the tags will be issued to those fishers who are the holders of a full share permit; and a partial share of the tags will be issued to the holders of a partial share permit. Individual tag allocations for all permit holders are achieved by first dividing New York's commercial striped bass quota by all eligible permit holders. A partial share permit holder receives 20 percent of this individual allocation. The full share individual quota is derived by subtracting the partial share quota from the total and dividing by the number of full share permit holders to achieve the individual full share allocation. (12)\n\nTags will be issued in equal numbers to each participant within each category described in paragraph (11) of this subdivision. (13)\n\nEach permittee will be provided, in batches, a number of tags equal to their individual quota. A permittee will be required to pay a fee per tag issued to them. The\ndepartment\nwill advise permit holders of the fee per tag each year when commercial tag order forms are distributed. The fee for tags must be paid in full before the permittee receives their tag allocation for the current year. No refunds or replacements will be made for tags which are lost, broken, confiscated or unused. (14)\n\nOnce a permittee's allocation of tags are used, he or she may not take striped bass for commercial purposes. (15)\n\nIt is unlawful to sell or offer for sale untagged striped bass or striped bass fillets or steaks unless the tagged carcass from which such fillets or steaks were removed is present and available for inspection. Possession of untagged striped bass or striped bass fillets or steaks without the properly tagged carcass in establishments where fish are sold or offered for sale (including wholesale establishments, retail establishments and restaurants) is presumptive\nevidence\nof intent to sell, trade or barter such striped bass. (16)\n\nIt is unlawful to reuse or alter any striped bass tag. Any permittee losing tags must report such loss to the\ndepartment\non their weekly reports. (17)\nA striped bass commercial permittee who takes and possesses a striped bass of legal commercial slot size shall immediately attach and securely lock into place through the mouth and gill a numbered strap tag issued by the\ndepartment\nimmediately after removing said striped bass from their gear and prior to attending another piece of gear. All striped bass not of legal commercial slot size shall be returned to the water immediately without unnecessary injury. Possession of striped bass not tagged as required by this subdivision is prohibited. (18)\n\nIt is unlawful to sell striped bass which are not properly tagged, as described in paragraph (17) of this subdivision. Retail markets may prepare portions of legally tagged striped bass for the consumer and must retain the tagged carcass until all portions are sold. The tag must then be removed from the rack and then destroyed by cutting the tag in two. (19)\n\nIt is unlawful for any\nperson\nto possess striped bass tags or tagged striped bass in the marine and coastal district and the shores thereof west of a line drawn due north from the mouth of Wading River Creek and west of a line at 73 degrees 46 minutes west longitude, which is near the terminus of East Rockaway Inlet. The closed area includes Jamaica Bay and all tributaries. (20)\n\nReporting requirements. Reporting requirements. (i) Fishing vessel trip reports. Any\nperson\nwho is a holder of a striped bass commercial permit shall complete and submit an accurate fishing vessel trip report for each commercial fishing trip, detailing all fishing activities and all species landed, pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Fishing vessel trip reports shall be completed, signed, and submitted to the\ndepartment\nfor each month; if no fishing trips were made for striped bass during a month, a report must be submitted for that month stating no striped bass trips were made. Permit holders who operate or who fish from a federally permitted vessel and take striped bass must submit the federal trip information to the\ndepartment\nfor each trip. This trip information includes but is not limited to the permit holder's permit number, the federal trip identification number, the number of tags used, the amount of striped bass landed (in pounds), disposition of striped bass, gear type, and tag serial numbers. This information must be reported on a form approved by the\ndepartment. Permit holders must submit the last report five days after the close of the commercial striped bass season or within five days after all striped bass tags are used. Permit holders must submit all required information, including, but not limited to, the name of the vessel, the permit number(s), trip type, all species taken, the striped bass tag serial numbers used for the trip, the weight (in pounds), and number of striped bass taken, the name and signature of the permit holder, and the date signed. All reports must be complete. Incomplete fishing vessel trip reports or unsigned reports will not satisfy these reporting requirements and may be returned to the permit holder who submitted them for completion. Once commercial striped bass permit holders have reported 100 percent use of the individual allocation of tags, they are no longer required to submit reports for striped bass. Permit holders who fail to submit acceptable fishing vessel trip reports to the\ndepartment\nmay be denied future commercial striped bass fishing permits pursuant to Part 175\nof this Title. (ii)\n\nStriped bass tags. All striped bass commercial permit holders must return any unused tags to the\ndepartment\nby December 20th of the year the tags were issued. Permit holders who fail to return unused tags may be denied future commercial striped bass fishing permits pursuant to Part 175\nof this Title. Permit holders who fail to accurately account for all tags may receive a reduction in the number of tags allocated in the next fishing season in which the permit holder applies for a striped bass commercial permit. This reduction in tags will be equal to the number of tags not accounted for in the previous fishing season. (21)\n\nManner of taking. Striped bass may be taken for commercial purposes by using any of the following gear types only: hook and line, pound net, trap net, gill net as specified in section\n40.5\n(e) of this Part, or as by-catch in otter trawls. Permit holders may use any of the legal gears to catch their individual allocation of striped bass. Otter trawl by-catch is limited to 21 striped bass per vessel per trip and shall be separately boxed. All other types of gear are prohibited for use in taking striped bass, including but not limited to: haul seines and spears. (22)\n\nNo\nperson\nshall possess striped bass or striped bass tags while in possession of a seine. (23)\n\nSpecial permits. The\ndepartment\nmay permit the sale of striped bass taken in another state provided that (i) the\n\nDepartment\nof Health certifies, based on sampling and analysis provided by such state, that such striped bass meet all standards for sale of fish in this State, (ii) such striped bass are of a size within the New York State slot size limit, (iii) such striped bass are tagged with serially numbered tags provided by the state of origin, and (iv) such state authorizes sale within its borders of striped bass taken in New York. Nothing in this section is deemed to prohibit the lawful transportation through the state of striped bass lawfully taken from waters outside the state to other states, provided that such fish are in their original unopened container and written documentation of their origin and destination accompanies such container. (24)\n\nThe\ndepartment\nmay authorize the sale of striped bass from marine hatcheries or off bottom culture facilities permitted pursuant to Part 48\nof this Title. (25)\n\nThe\ndepartment\nmay permit the importation and sale of striped bass hybrids or striped bass from aquaculture facilities outside of New York State provided that the\nfacility\nor jurisdiction within which such\nfacility\nis located provides for hybrid striped bass documentation as to the origin of these fish in a manner acceptable to the\ndepartment\nand for striped bass said documentation as well as individual tagging acceptable to the\ndepartment. (k) Atlantic sturgeon commercial fishing-special\nregulations. (1)\n\nAny Atlantic sturgeon inadvertently taken in New York must be returned to the water immediately without unnecessary injury. (2)\n\nIt is unlawful for any\nperson\nto sell, import, traffic in or possess Atlantic sturgeon or Atlantic sturgeon products in New York. (3)\n\nAny\nperson\nviolating any provision of these\nregulations\nmay be subject to license revocation as provided in Part 175\nof this Title. (l) Summer flounder (fluke) commercial fishing-special\nregulations. (1)\n\nThe total\nannual\nharvest of summer flounder for the period January 1st through December 31st, is the amount allocated annually to New York State by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the United States\n\nDepartment\nof Commerce and/or the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC). (2)\n\nFollowing consultation with the commercial fishing industry, the\ndepartment\nmay establish quota periods, allocations for quota periods, trip limits, and directed fishery thresholds for summer flounder, pursuant to subdivision (u) of this section, consistent with the\nannual\nallocation (quota) assigned to New York such that harvest does not exceed such quota. (3)\n\nWhen the\ndepartment\ndetermines, based on a projection of any period's landings using the United States\n\nDepartment\nof Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service's weekly dealer reports, that trip limits are necessary as provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, such trip limits will be required and enforceable upon 72 hours written notice to permit holders of the appropriate limit allowed per vessel for the specified permitted gear category for that time period. Such trip limits may be further reduced by written direction of the\ndepartment\nif the projection of the landings indicates a closure will be required before the end of the period. In any month the trip limits may be increased if the projection of the landings indicates the period's total quota will not be caught. During periods of trip limits, all summer flounder not being held alive must be held together in a separate container or containers readily available for inspection and may not be mixed with other species while on board any vessel. (4)\n\nIf the\ndepartment\ndetermines that the maximum allowable harvest of summer flounder for any time period established pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision will have been reached before the end of that period, harvesting for commercial purposes and possession of summer flounder shall be prohibited for all permit holders except as permitted in paragraph (5) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nIf the\ndepartment\ncloses the summer flounder fishery at any time between May 1st and October 31st, the harvesting and possession of summer flounder for commercial purposes shall be prohibited for all permit holders except for holders of fixed gear category summer flounder permits. Fixed gear category permit holders may harvest up to a limit of 100 pounds per trip during harvest closures that occur between May 1st and October 31st. (6)\n\nExcept as permitted in subdivision (e) of this section, 14 days following the beginning of any period when all commercial harvesting is prohibited, it is unlawful to possess summer flounder for sale, or offer summer flounder for sale, trade or barter during the period January 1st through April 30th and November 1st through December 31st and it is unlawful to sell or offer for sale, trade or barter summer flounder taken by gear other than fixed gear during the period May 1st through October 31st unless such summer flounder are separately boxed and properly tagged pursuant to the procedure set forth in subdivision (e) of this section. (7)\n\nIt is unlawful for any\nperson\nto take summer flounder for commercial purposes without having in possession a summer flounder commercial permit. If the applicant for permit is a corporation, such application must name a specific vessel and a separate permit must be obtained for each vessel fishing owned by the corporation. Such corporate permits must be carried on the specific vessel named in the permit when that vessel is being used to take summer flounder for commercial purposes. For purposes of this subdivision, a\nperson\nis presumed to be taking summer flounder for commercial purposes when that\nperson\npossesses more summer flounder than the possession limit indicated in Table A of this section. A permit to take summer flounder will be issued at no cost to any\nperson\nwho meets the following criteria: (i) currently possesses a valid New York State commercial food fish license and previously held a New York State commercial food fish license during 1992 or any subsequent year; and\n(a) previously held a summer flounder commercial permit; or\n(b) has on file with the\ndepartment\na 1994 summer flounder commercial permit application that was received prior to close of business on April 15, 1994; and\n(c) (with respect to\ncalendar year\n1995 only) held a 1994 New York State commercial food fish license, and for whom the\ndepartment\nfinds that, based on advice received from the\ndepartment\nin 1994, with respect to future requirements for summer flounder commercial permits, which advice subsequently proved to be affected by changes to eligibility requirements, the applicant relied upon such advice and either failed to apply for a permit or made an investment under the expectation that such a permit would be issued; and\n(ii)\ncan demonstrate through Federal or New York State tax records that 50 percent or more of his or her earned income during any one year in the period January 1988 to December 1992 or any subsequent year resulted from his or her direct participation in the harvest of marine fish, shellfish, crustacea or other marine biota. For purposes of this subdivision, earned income\nis defined as income derived from labor, professional service, or entrepreneurship as opposed to income derived from invested capital, retirement pay or pensions. (8)\n\nApplications for a summer flounder commercial permit will be accepted from November 15th until close of business April 15th. Any application received after close of business April 15th will not be entertained. Incomplete applications received before close of business April 15th must be completed no later than close of business May 15th in order to be issued. No permit will be issued after May 15th. Applications arriving or remaining incomplete after that date will be returned without action. (9)\n\nPermittees must state and affirm on the application form designed and provided by the\ndepartment\ntheir name, address, commercial food fish license number, their intent to be permitted to use only fixed gear (pound/trap net), only hook and line gear or for the use of all gear. The commercial permit thereafter issued will authorize landings for that entire\ncalendar year\nfrom that category of gear only and it will be unlawful to take summer flounder with gear other than that designated on the permit. Unless at least 50 permit holders select the hook and line gear category, there will not be a separate allocation of summer flounder reserved for those permit holders and they will then fish under the requirements for the all gear category. (10)\n\nIt is unlawful for any\nperson\nto land summer flounder for commercial purposes without having in possession a summer flounder commercial permit or a summer flounder landing permit provided by the\ndepartment\nupon application on the form provided by the\ndepartment. If the applicant for a permit is a corporation, such application must name a specific vessel and a separate permit must be obtained for each vessel owned by that corporation. Such corporate permits must be carried on the specific vessel named in the permit when that vessel is being used to land summer flounder for commercial purposes. A landing permit will be issued at no cost to any\nperson\nwho meets the following criteria: (i) currently possesses a valid New York State food fish landing license and previously held a New York State commercial food fish landing license during 1992 or any subsequent year; and\n(a) previously held a summer flounder commercial permit or a summer flounder landing permit; or\n(b) has on file with the\ndepartment\na 1994 summer flounder commercial permit application or summer flounder landing permit application received prior to close of business on April 15, 1994; and\n(ii)\ncan demonstrate through Federal or New York State tax records that 50 percent or more of his or her earned income during any one year in the period January 1988 to December 1992 or any subsequent year resulted from his or her direct participation in the harvest of marine fish, shellfish, crustacea or other marine biota. For purposes of this subdivision, earned income\nis defined as income derived from labor, professional service, or entrepreneurship as opposed to income derived from invested capital, retirement pay or pensions. Such summer flounder landing permits will be issued from January 1st until close of business April 15th each year. (11)\n\nPermits issued under this subdivision will be nontransferable except the\ndepartment\nmay permit a one-time reissuance of a summer flounder commercial harvesters permit pursuant to the provisions of Environmental Conservation Law, section 13-0328(6). Upon reissuance, the former holder of such permit will waive eligibility for summer flounder commercial harvesters permits and all rights and responsibilities associated with such permit shall pass to the recipient of such reissued permit. Summer flounder commercial permits will expire on the last\nday\nof December of each year. (12)\n\nPermit\nmodification, suspension or revocation will be pursuant to Part 175\nof this Title. (13)\n\nThe possession of summer flounder for commercial purposes from which the head or tail have been removed or that have been otherwise cleaned, cut, filleted, or skinned so that the total length or identity cannot be determined, and which are not in properly labeled containers as required by subdivision (e) of this section, is prohibited unless such summer flounder are in a wholesale or retail establishment or restaurant for sale to the consumer. (14)\n\nNo\nperson\nmay commercially harvest, sell, offer for sale, trade or barter or possess summer flounder except in compliance with this subdivision. (15)\n\nThe\ndepartment\nmay, under mutual agreement with another state and with the concurrence of the Regional\n\nAdministrator\nof the Northeast Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, transfer summer flounder quota to that state or combine the summer flounder quota from that state with the New York quota. (16)\n\nAny holder of a New York commercial food fish license who is the\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a fishing vessel not holding a Federal Fisheries Permit for summer flounder issued by the United States\n\nDepartment\nof Commerce must complete a daily fishing log supplied by the Regional\n\nAdministrator\nof the National Marine Fisheries Service, Northeast Region. Failure to complete a log may result in a denial of a future application for a summer flounder permit. (17)\n\nAll persons who hold a summer flounder commercial hook and line permit shall file an accurate weekly report on all summer flounder harvesting activities on the State copy of the fishing vessel trip report forms as required in subdivision (c) of this section, whether or not any summer flounder were actually taken. The State copies of the fishing vessel trip report for a given week will be due to the\ndepartment\non a weekly basis, within five days following the Saturday of each week. Failure to complete and file an acceptable weekly report with the\ndepartment\nmay result in a denial of a future application for a summer flounder permit. (m) Bluefish commercial fishing-special\nregulations. (1)\n\nThe total\nannual\nharvest of bluefish may not exceed that amount annually allocated to New York State by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the United States\n\nDepartment\nof Commerce and/or the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) for the period January 1st through December 31st. (2)\n\nFollowing consultation with industry, the\ndepartment\nmay establish quota periods, trip limits and directed fishery thresholds such that the harvest does not exceed the quota assigned to New York. (3)\n\nWhen the\ndepartment\ndetermines, based on a projection of landings using the United States\n\nDepartment\nof Commerce, National Marine Fisheries Service's weekly dealer reports, that trip limits are necessary as provided in Table B of subdivision (i) of this section, such trip limits will be required and enforceable upon 72 hours written notice to license holders of the appropriate limit allowed per vessel for that time period. Such trip limits may be further reduced by written direction of the\ndepartment\nif the projection of the landings indicates a closure will be required before the end of the period. In any month the trip limits may be increased if the projection of the landings indicates the total quota will not be caught. (4)\n\nDuring periods of trip limits, all bluefish must be held together in a separate container or containers readily available for inspection and may not be mixed with other species while on board any vessel. (5)\n\nIf the\ndepartment\ndetermines that the maximum allowable harvest of bluefish will have taken place before the end of that period, harvesting for commercial purposes and possession of bluefish will be prohibited for all license holders as directed by the\ndepartment\nupon 72 hours written notice to commercial food fish license holders. (6)\n\nFourteen days following the beginning of any period when all commercial harvesting is prohibited, it shall be unlawful to possess bluefish for sale, or offer bluefish for sale, trade or barter, except as permitted in subdivision (e) of this section. (7)\n\nIt is unlawful for any\nperson\nto take bluefish for commercial purposes without having in possession a valid New York State commercial food fish license. For purposes of this subdivision, a\nperson\nis presumed to be taking bluefish for commercial purposes when that\nperson\npossesses more bluefish than the possession limit indicated in Table A of subdivision (f) of this section. (8)\n\nThe possession of bluefish for commercial purposes from which the head or tail have been removed or otherwise cleaned, cut, filleted, or skinned so that the total length or identity cannot be determined and which are not in containers tagged as required by subdivision (e) of this section is prohibited unless such bluefish are in a wholesale or retail establishment or restaurant for sale to the consumer. (9)\n\nNo\nperson\nmay commercially harvest, sell, offer for sale, trade or barter or possess bluefish except in compliance with this subdivision. (10)\n\nThe use of pair trawls, two boat trawls or paranzella nets for the taking of bluefish is prohibited. The possession or landing of bluefish from any vessel having aboard a pair trawl, two boat trawl or paranzella net is also prohibited. (11)\n\nThe\ndepartment\nmay, under mutual agreement with another state and with the concurrence of the Regional\n\nAdministrator\nof the Northeast Region, National Marine Fisheries Service, transfer bluefish quota to that state or combine the bluefish quota from that state with the New York quota. (12)\n\nAny holder of a New York commercial food fish license who is the\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a fishing vessel not holding a Federal fisheries permit for bluefish issued by the United States\n\nDepartment\nof Commerce must complete a daily fishing log supplied by the Regional\n\nAdministrator\nof the National Marine Fisheries Service, Northeast Region. Failure to complete a log may result in a denial of future participation in the bluefish fishery. (n) Winter flounder commercial fishing-special\nregulations. (1)\n\nThe use of a gill or trammel net for the taking of winter flounder is prohibited. (2)\n\nWinter flounder legally harvested from waters outside the State may be possessed on board vessels transiting State waters, and may be landed in New York at any time. Persons on such vessels may not fish for winter flounder in State waters or possess winter flounder while fishing in State waters with those gear types seasonally prohibited under Table B of this section. (o) Tautog commercial fishing-special\nregulations. (1)\n\nIt shall be unlawful to take or land tautog from any boat or vessel for commercial purposes in excess of the commercial possession limit regardless of the number of commercial license holders aboard such boat or vessel. (2)\n\nNo individual may place tautog in\nstorage\nin the waters of the marine and coastal district in excess of the recreational possession limit unless he or she is the holder of a commercial license issued pursuant to section\n13-0335\nof the Environmental Conservation Law (food fish license). (3)\n\nAny containers, pens or live cars placed in the waters of the marine and coastal district to store tautog for commercial purposes must be clearly labeled and have visible on the top of such container, pen or live car the name and food fish license number of the\nperson\nresponsible for the fish stored within such containers, pens or live cars. (4)\n\nNo individual may possess tautog in\nstorage\nin the waters of the marine and coastal district in excess of the commercial possession limit unless the individual submits trip reports for all live stored tautog, as specified in subparagraph (5)(iv) of this subdivision, to the\ndepartment\nwithin twenty-four hours of landing. Individuals must retain copies of submitted trip reports for inspection onboard their vessel during the tagging season. (5)\n\nCommercial Tagging Requirements. (i) All commercially harvested tautog must be tagged with a single-use serialized tag as specified by the\ndepartment. Only tags issued for the tautog tagging season in which the fish was harvested may be applied to tautog. Tags must be applied to one of the tautog's gill plates with the tag information visible on the outside of the fish. Tags must be applied prior to any commercially harvested species from the trip being offloaded or transferred to shore, to another vessel, to an in-water\nstorage\nunit, or to any pier, wharf, dock or similar structure. (ii)\n\nPossession of a valid food fish license, issued pursuant to section\n13-0335\nof the Environmental Conservation Law, is required to be eligible to order tags. A tag order must be submitted and approved by the\ndepartment\nbefore any tags can be issued. The license holder may be required to pay a fee not to exceed 35 cents per tag issued to the license holder. Any required fee for the tags must be paid in full before tags will be issued to the license holder. No refunds or replacements will be made for tags which are lost, damaged, returned, confiscated, or stolen. After the license holder's initial tag order, the license holder must account for eighty percent of the tags the license holder has been issued during the current tagging season before the license holder's next tag order can be approved. Tags must be accounted for through trip reports or damaged tags returned to the\ndepartment. Failure to account for over twenty percent of the tags issued to the license holder during the current tagging season will result in the\ndepartment\ndenying any additional tag orders for the current tagging season. A license holder whose tag order has been denied may submit an excessive loss application, on a form provided by the\ndepartment, for the opportunity to receive one additional tag order during that tagging season. (iii)\n\nThe maximum number of tags that may be issued in a single tag order is the highest historical number of tautog reported as landed in one\ncalendar year\nby the license holder during one of the previous three calendar years immediately preceding the year of issue. For purposes of determining the amount of reported landings, only the following documented landings will be counted: landings submitted to the\ndepartment\nthrough state vessel trip reports, federal vessel trip reports, and landings submitted electronically through the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program. A license holder who is unable to document a history of tautog landings in one of the three calendar years immediately preceding the year of issue, is eligible to submit one tag order per business week for a maximum of 50 tags per tag order. (iv)\n\nIn addition to the trip reporting requirements in subdivision\n40.1\n(c), food fish license holders harvesting tautog must also include the following information in their trip reports: the tautog tag serial numbers used for the trip, the weight of the tautog (in pounds), and the number of tautog taken. License holders who operate federally permitted vessels and harvest tautog must complete and submit the State copy of their fishing vessel trip report (NOAA Form No. 88-30) to the\ndepartment\nfor each commercial tautog trip. License holders must submit their final tautog report, along with the NY Tautog Tag Accounting Form, by February 15 for the previous tagging season. License holders who fail to submit complete and accurate reports to the\ndepartment\nby February 15 may not be eligible to receive tautog tags for the following tagging season. (v) It is unlawful to reuse or alter any tautog tag. Any license holder who loses tags must report the loss to the\ndepartment\non their fishing reports or through a form provided by the\ndepartment\nwithin twenty-four hours. Tautog tags are non-transferable, and it is unlawful for any\nperson\nto possess tautog tags issued to another license holder, except as a designated agent to pick up and deliver a tag order from the\ndepartment. At no time may a designated agent be in possession of another license holder's tags while onboard a vessel or in possession of tautog. (vi)\n\nAll food fish license holders who are issued tautog tags must return any unused or damaged tags to the\ndepartment\nby February 15 after the tagging season for which they were issued. A license holder who fails to return unused tags may not be eligible to receive tautog tags for the following tagging season. (vii)\n\nIt is unlawful to sell, or offer for sale, untagged whole tautog. It is unlawful to sell, or offer for sale, tautog fillets or parts unless the tagged carcass from which such fillets or parts were removed is present and available for inspection. Possession of untagged tautog, or tautog fillets or parts without the properly tagged carcass, in establishments where fish are sold or offered for sale (including wholesale establishments, retail establishments, and restaurants) is presumptive\nevidence\nof the intent to sell, trade, or barter such tautog. All New York harvested tautog which are tagged during the tautog tagging season may be offered for sale, trade, or barter through March 15. After March 15, tautog tagged during the previous tautog tagging season must not be offered for sale, trade or barter. (viii)\n\nTautog legally harvested from other states, that are tagged with serially numbered tags provided by the state of origin, may be sold or offered for sale if the tautog meets all applicable provisions of the Environmental Conservation Law. (p) American eel commercial fishing-special\nregulations. (1)\n\nIt shall be unlawful to use eel traps or pots in the waters of the marine and coastal district for commercial purposes with mesh sizes smaller than one inch by one-half inch unless such pots contain an escape panel that is at least four inches square with a mesh size of one inch by one-half inch located so that the panel is on a side, but not at the bottom of the trap or pot. (2)\n\nAny containers, pens or live cars, placed in the waters of the marine and coastal district to store American eels for commercial purposes must be clearly labeled and have visible on the top of such container pen or live car the name and food fish license number of the\nperson\nresponsible for the fish stored within such containers, pens or live cars. (q) Weakfish commercial fishing-special\nregulations. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, weakfish may only be sold, traded, bartered, offered for sale, or transported in New York during the open season, or within two weeks following the close of the season. (2)\n\nPersons authorized by Table B may sell during any period where there is a closure for weakfish lawfully taken and landed provided that the fish are in boxes closed and sealed and the boxes are marked with a tag at least two inches wide and four inches long of substantial, water-resistant material. Such tag must indicate clearly the state of origin, the shippers name, location\nlanded, and the date landed. Weakfish lawfully taken and landed in other states may be shipped into New York for trade, or sale during any closure, provided that they meet the tagging requirements above and that: (i) such weakfish meet the minimum total length, fillet or dressed length requirement for this species; and\n(ii)\nsuch state authorizes reciprocal privileges within its borders for weakfish taken in New York. (3)\n\nNothing in this subdivision shall prohibit the lawful transportation through the State of weakfish lawfully taken from waters outside the State to other states, provided that such fish are in their original unopened container and written documentation of their origin and destination accompanies such container. (4)\n\nExcept during the open season, it is unlawful for any\nperson\nto land or possess on the waters of the marine district, weakfish from which the head or tail have been removed or that have been otherwise cleaned, cut, filleted, or skinned so that the total length or identify cannot be determined. (5)\n\nThe use of pair trawls, two boat trawls or paranzella nets for the taking of weakfish is prohibited. The landing of weakfish from any vessel having aboard a pair trawl, two boat trawl or paranzella net is also prohibited. (r) Scup commercial fishing-special\nregulations. (1)\n\nThe total\nannual\nharvest of scup may not exceed that amount annually allocated to New York State by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) in the U.S. Department\nof Commerce and/or the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission for the period May 1st through October 31st. Harvest limits for scup are based on the fishery management plan (FMP) for scup as adopted and approved by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) and the Regional Fishery Management Council pursuant to the Fishery Conservation and Management\n\nAct, 16 U.S.C. section\n1801, et seq. and the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management\n\nAct, 16 U.S.C. section\n5101, et seq. (2)\n\nQuotas, trip limits and directed fishery thresholds for the periods of January 1st to April 30th and November 1st to December 31st will be established by NMFS. The\ndepartment\nwill establish trip limits and directed fishery thresholds within the periods of January 1st to April 30th and November 1st to December 31st consistent with those established by NMFS. Trip limits and directed fishery thresholds will be established for the period of May 1st to October 31st such that the harvest in this period does not exceed the quota assigned to New York by NMFS and/or the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. The\ndepartment\nmay establish trip limits within the period of May 1st to October 31st annually, based upon projected landings, and the FMP, following consultation with industry and appropriate notice to individual fishermen. (3)\n\nWhen the\ndepartment\ndetermines during the period of May 1st to October 31st, based on a projection of any period's landings using the NMFS weekly dealer reports, that adjustment of a trip limit is necessary as provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, such trip limits will be adjusted, and will be enforceable upon 72 hours written notice to license holders of the trip limit allowed per vessel for that time period.
