(b) Where both a husband and\nwife are residents and they determine their Federal taxable income on a joint\n\nFederal income tax return, they must also determine their New York taxable\nincome jointly on a joint New York State personal income tax return (also see\nsection\n651[b][2] of the Tax\n\nLaw). (c) If neither husband or\nwife, both of whom are residents, files a Federal income tax return, they may\ndetermine their New York taxable income jointly on a joint New York State\npersonal income tax return, or if both so elect, they may determine their New\n\nYork taxable incomes separately on separate New York State personal income tax\nreturns (also see section\n651[b][3] of the Tax\n\nLaw). (d) Husband and wife\nwith different resident status.
