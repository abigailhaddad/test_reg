The preferred\nmicrophone height on flat terrain is four feet (1.2 m). (b) (1)\n\nWhen the sound level measurement system is hand-held or is otherwise monitored\nby a person located near its microphone, the holder must orient himself\nrelative to the highway in a manner consistent with the recommendation of the\nmanufacturer of the sound level measurement system.
