  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 86-1.25 - Capital expense reimbursement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The allowable costs of fixed capital (including but not limited to depreciation, rentals and interest on capital debt), and major movable equipment shall be reimbursed based on budgeted data and shall be reconciled to total actual expense for the rate year and shall be determined and computed in accordance with the provisions of subdivisions (f), (g) and (h) of this section. (b) General hospitals shall submit a schedule of anticipated inpatient capital-related expenses for the forthcoming year to the commissioner at least 120 days prior to the beginning of the rate year. (c) The following principles shall apply to budgets for inpatient capital-related expenses: (1)\n\nThe basis for determining capital-related inpatient expenses shall be the lesser of actual cost or the final amount specifically approved for construction of the capital asset. (2)\n\nAny capital-related inpatient expense generated by a capital expenditure which requires or required approval pursuant to article 28 of the Public Health Law, must have received such approval for the capital-related expense to be included in the rate calculation. (3)\n\nThe submitted budget may include the capital-related inpatient expense of all existing capital assets, as well as estimates of capital-related inpatient expenses for capital assets to be acquired or placed in use prior to the commencement of the rate year. (4)\n\nAny capital-related expense generated by a capital expenditure acquired or placed in use during a rate year shall be carried forward to the subsequent rate year, provided all required approvals have been obtained. In instances where such approvals have been obtained or where approval is not required and such assets are acquired or placed in use during a rate year, the budget may include estimates for capital-related expenses relating to these assets. (d) Allocation of budgeted capital costs. In each rate year budgeted capital costs shall be allocated to exempt units and hospitals (including certified substance abuse detoxification services) to DRG case-payment rates based on reported capital trace back statistics for the two years prior to the rate year. (e) Payment for budgeted allocated capital costs. (1)\n\nCapital per diems for exempt units and hospitals shall be calculated by dividing the budgeted capital costs allocated to such rates in paragraph (d) of this section by the budgeted exempt unit days, reconciled to actual rate year days and actual rate year exempt unit or hospital-approved capital expense. Effective on or after April 1, 2020 and thereafter, the budgeted and actual capital per diem rates shall be reduced by five percent (5%). Additionally, for capital per diem rates reconciled on or after April 1, 2020, if the difference between the budgeted and actual capital per diem rate results in a positive rate adjustment, that rate adjustment shall be reduced by ten percent (10%). Conversely, if the difference between the budgeted and actual capital per diem rate results in a negative rate adjustment, that rate adjustment shall be increased by ten percent (10%). (2)\n\nCapital payments for Acute DRG case rates shall be determined by dividing the budgeted capital allocated to such rates in paragraph (d) of this section by the hospital's budgeted Acute discharges, reconciled to actual rate year discharges and actual rate year Acute or hospital-approved capital expense. Effective on or after April 1, 2020 and thereafter, the budgeted and actual capital Acute DRG case rates shall be reduced by five percent (5%). Additionally, for Acute DRG case rates reconciled on or after April 1, 2020, if the difference between the budgeted and actual capital Acute DRG case rate results in a positive rate adjustment, that rate adjustment shall be reduced by ten percent (10%). Conversely, if the difference between the budgeted and actual capital Acute DRG case rate results in a negative rate adjustment, that rate adjustment shall be increased by ten percent (10%). (f) Depreciation. (1)\n\nReported depreciation based on historical cost is recognized as a proper element of cost. Useful lives shall be the higher of the reported useful life or those useful lives from the Estimated Useful Lives of Depreciable Hospital Assets, American Hospital Association, consistent with title XVIII provisions. Copies of this publication are available from the American Hospital Association, One North Franklin, Chicago, IL 60606-3421, and a copy is available for inspection and copying at the offices of the records access officer of the Department of Health, Corning Tower, Empire State Plaza, Albany, NY 12237. (2)\n\nIn the computation of rates for voluntary facilities, depreciation shall be included on a straight line method on plant and nonmovable equipment. Depreciation on movable equipment may be computed on a straight line method or accelerated under a double declining balance or sum-of-the-years' digit method. Depreciation shall be funded unless the commissioner determines, upon application by the facility, and after inviting written comments from interested parties, that the requested waiver of the requirements for funding is a matter of public interest and necessity. In instances where funding is required, such fund may be used only for capital expenditures with approval as required for the amortization of capital indebtedness. Funding for plant and fixed equipment shall mean that the transfer of monies to the funded accounts shall occur by the end of the fiscal period in which the depreciation is recorded. Board-designated funds and the accrual of liabilities to the funded depreciation accounts (due to/from accounts) shall not be recognized as funding of depreciation. Deposits to the funded depreciation accounts must remain in such accounts to be considered as valid funding transactions unless expended for the purpose for which it was funded. (3)\n\nIn the computation of rates for public facilities, depreciation is to be included on a straight-line method on plant and nonmovable equipment. Depreciation on movable equipment may be computed on a straight-line method or accelerated under a double declining balance or sum-of-the-years' digits method. (4)\n\nMedical facilities financed by mortgage loans pursuant to the Nursing Home Companies Law or the Hospital Mortgage Loan Construction Law shall conform to the requirements of this Subpart. In lieu of depreciation and interest, on the loan-financed portion of the facilities, the commissioner shall allow level debt service on the mortgage loan, for all loans approved for financing prior to January 1, 1990, together with such required fixed charges, sinking funds and reserves as may be determined by the commissioner as necessary to assure repayment of the mortgage indebtedness. For loans approved for financing on or after January 1, 1990, medical facilities shall receive reimbursement in the form of interest and depreciation in accordance with the remainder of this Subpart. (5)\n\nArticle IX-C corporations may elect to include in their reimbursement rates depreciation computed by a method other than that used in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, subject to approval by the commissioner. (6)\n\nWith respect to outpatient facilities, capital cost reimbursement may include an amount for rent, provided the following conditions are met: (i) the lease is reviewed and approved by the department or any other appropriate State agency; (ii)\nthe space rented is in a multi-purpose, multi-use building not specifically constructed for the purpose of housing an outpatient facility; (iii)\nthe rental, if the lease is a sublease, is the same or less than comparable leases in the geographic area; (iv)\nthe applicant has no interest, direct or indirect, beneficial or of record, in the ownership of the building or any over lease; and\n(v) the rental per square foot, in the judgment of the department, is the same as or is comparable to other rentals in the building in which the outpatient service is to be located, and the rental per square foot is comparable to the rental of similar space in other comparable buildings in the area when such comparisons can be made. (g) Interest. (1)\n\nNecessary interest on both current and capital indebtedness is an allowable cost for all medical facilities. (2)\n\nTo be considered as an allowable cost, interest shall be incurred to satisfy a financial need, and at a rate not in excess of what a prudent borrower would have had to pay in the money market at the time the loan was made and exclude costs and fees incurred as a result of an interest rate swap agreement. Also, the interest shall be paid to a lender not related through control, ownership, affiliation or personal relationship to the borrower, except in instances where the prior approval of the commissioner has been obtained. Financial need for capital indebtedness relating to a specific project shall exist when all available restricted funds designated for capital acquisition of that type have been considered for equity purposes. (3)\n\nInterest expense shall be reduced by investment income with the exception of income from funded depreciation, qualified pension funds, trusteed malpractice insurance funds, or in instances where income from gifts or grants is restricted by donors. Interest on funds borrowed from a donor restricted fund or funded depreciation is an allowable expense. Investment income shall be defined as the aggregate net amount realized from dividends, interest, rental income, interest earned on temporary investment of withholding taxes, as well as all gains and losses. If the aggregate net amount realized is a loss, the loss shall not be allowable. Rate year investment income shall reduce rate year interest expense allowed for reimbursement as follows: (i) for all medical facilities, investment income shall first be used to reduce operating interest expense for that year; (ii)\nany remaining amount of investment income, after application of paragraph (i), shall be used to reduce capital interest expense reimbursed that year for medical facilities; and\n(iii)\nany remaining amount of investment income after application of paragraph (ii) shall not be considered in the determination of allowable costs. (4)\n\nInterest on current indebtedness shall be treated and reported as an operating, administrative expense. (5)\n\nInterest on capital indebtedness is an allowable cost if the debt generating the interest is approved by the commissioner, incurred for authorized purposes, and the principal of the debt does not exceed either the approval of the commissioner or the cost of the authorized purposes. Capital indebtedness shall mean all debt obligations of a facility that are: (i) evidenced by a mortgage note or bond and secured by a mortgage on the land, building or nonmovable equipment; a note payable secured by the nonmovable equipment of a facility; a capital lease; (ii)\nincurred for the purpose of financing the acquisition, construction or renovation of land, building or nonmovable equipment; (iii)\nfound by the commissioner to be reasonable, necessary and in the public interest with respect to the facility. Interest related to refinancing indebtedness shall be considered an allowable cost only to the extent that it is payable with respect to an amount equal to the unpaid principal of the indebtedness then being refinanced. However, interest incurred on refinanced debt in excess of the previously unpaid balance of there financed indebtedness will be allowable on acceptable demonstration to the commissioner that such refinancing will result in a debt service savings over the life of the indebtedness; or\n(iv)\nincurred for the purpose of advance refunding of debt. Gains and losses resulting from the advanced refunding of debt shall be treated and reported as a deferred charge or asset. This deferred charge or asset is to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the period to the scheduled maturity date of the refunding debt. (6)\n\nWhere a public finance authority has established a mortgage rate of interest such that sufficient cash flows exist to retire the mortgage prior to the stated maturity, the amount of the mortgage to be forgiven, at the time of such forgiveness, shall be capitalized as a deferred asset and amortized over the remaining mortgage life, as a reduction to the facility's capital expense. (7)\n\nVoluntary facilities shall report mortgage obligations financed by public finance authorities for their benefit and which they are responsible to repay, as liabilities in the general fund, when such mortgage obligations are incurred. (h) Sales, leases and realty transactions. (1)\n\nIf a medical facility is sold or leased or is the subject of any other realty transaction before a rate for the facility has been determined and certified by the commissioner, the capital cost component of such rate shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of this section. (2)\n\nIf a medical facility is sold or leased or is the subject of any other realty transaction after a rate for the facility has been determined and certified by the commissioner, the capital cost component of such rate shall be considered to be continuing with the same force and effect as though such sale, lease or other realty transaction had not occurred. This subdivision shall not be construed as limiting the powers and rights of the commissioner to change rate computations generally or specifically when based upon previous error, deceit or any other misrepresentation or misstatement that has led the commissioner to determine and certify a rate which he would otherwise not have determined or certified. Further, this subdivision shall not be construed as limiting the powers and rights of the commissioner to reduce rates when one or more of the original property right aspects related to such a facility is terminated. (3)\n\nAn arms length lease purchase agreement with a nonrelated lessor involving plant facilities or equipment which meets any one of the four following conditions, establishes the lease as a virtual purchase. (i) The lease transfers title of the facilities or equipment to the lessee during the lease term. (ii)\n\nThe lease contains a bargain purchase option. (iii)\n\nThe lease term is at least 75 percent of the useful life of the facilities or equipment. This provision is not applicable if the lease begins in the last 25 percent of the useful life of the facilities or equipment. (iv)\n\nThe present value of the minimum lease payments (payments to be made during the lease term including bargain purchase option, guaranteed residual value and penalties for failure to renew) equals at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the leased property. This provision is not applicable if the lease begins in the last 25 percent of the useful life of the facilities or equipment. Present value is computed using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate, unless the interest rate implicit in the lease is known and is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate, in which case the interest rate implicit in the lease is used. (4)\n\nIf a lease is established as a virtual purchase under subdivision (d) of this section, the rental charge may be included in capital-related costs to the extent that it does not exceed the amount that the provider would have included in capital-related costs if it had legal title to the asset (the cost of ownership). The cost of ownership shall be limited to depreciation and interest. Further, the amounts to be included in capital-related costs are determined as follows: (i) The difference between the amount of rent paid and the amount of rent allowed as capital-related costs is considered a deferred charge and is capitalized as part of the historical cost of the asset when the asset is purchased. (ii)\n\nIf an asset is returned to the owner instead of being purchased, the deferred charge may be included in capital-related costs in the year the asset is returned. (iii)\n\nIf the term of the lease is extended for an additional period of time at a reduced lease cost and the option to purchase still exists, the deferred charge may be included in capital-related costs to the extent of increasing the reduced rental to an amount not in excess of the cost of ownership. (iv)\n\nIf the term of the lease is extended for an additional period of time at a reduced lease cost and the option to purchase no longer exists, the deferred charge may be included in capital-related costs to the extent of increasing the reduced rental to a fair rental value. (v) If the lessee becomes the owner of the leased asset (either by operation of the lease or by other means), the amount considered as depreciation for the purpose of having computed the limitation on rental charges under subdivision (e) of this section, must be used in calculating the limitation on adjustments for the purpose of determining any gain or loss upon disposal of an asset. (vi)\n\nIn the aggregate, the amount of rental or lease costs included in capital-related costs may not exceed the amount of the costs of ownership that the provider could have included in capital-related costs had the provider legal title to the asset. (5)\n\nIf a facility enters into a sale and lease back agreement involving plant facilities or equipment, the amounts to be included in capital-related costs both on an annual basis and over the useful life of the asset shall not exceed the costs of ownership which shall be limited to depreciation and interest, and shall be determined as follows: (i) If the annual rental or lease costs in the early years of the lease are less than the annual costs of ownership, but in the later years of the lease the annual rental or lease costs are more than the annual costs of ownership, in the years that the annual rental or lease costs are more than the annual costs of ownership, the facility may include in capital-related costs annually the actual amount of rental or lease costs, except that in any given year, the amount included in capital related costs is limited to an amount which would not cause the aggregate rental or lease costs included up to that year in capital-related costs to exceed the costs of ownership that would have been included in capital-related costs up to that year if the provider had retained legal title to the asset. (ii)\n\nIf the annual rental or lease costs in the early years of the lease exceed the annual costs of ownership, but in the later years of the lease the annual rental or lease costs are less than the annual costs of ownership, the facility may carry forward amounts of rental or lease costs that were not included in capital-related costs in the early years of the lease due to the costs of ownership limitation, and include these amounts in capital-related costs in the years of the lease when the annual rental or lease costs are less than the annual costs of ownership, provided, however, in any given year the amount of actual annual rental or lease costs plus the amount carried forward to that year may not exceed the amount of the costs of ownership for that year. (iii)\n\nIn the aggregate, the amount of rental or lease costs included in capital-related costs may not exceed the amount of the costs of ownership that the provider could have included in capital-related costs if the provider had retained legal title to the asset. (iv)\n\nIf a facility enters into a sale and lease back agreement involving land, the incurred rental for the cost of land may not be included in allowable costs. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
