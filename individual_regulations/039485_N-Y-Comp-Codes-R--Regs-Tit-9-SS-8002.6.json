  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8002.6 - Parole violator re-release\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definition. A\ntime assessment\nis a period of\nreincarceration which is fixed as a result of a sustained violation at a final\nparole revocation hearing. A time assessment may be imposed for each sustained\nviolation charge for which a period of reincarceration is authorized in a\nrevocation case. The date upon which a parole violator who receives any time\nassessment will be eligible for re-release is determined by the expiration of\nthe longest time assessment imposed within the revocation\ncase. (b) How time\nassessments are calculated. (1)\n\nTime\nassessments will be set in months or days, depending on the circumstances, except, where applicable, they may be set as a hold to the maximum expiration\nof the sentence. Only time assessments corresponding to sustained technical\nviolation charges may be set in days. (2)\n\nTime assessments will commence and be\ncredited as follows: (i) Where a parole\nwarrant was executed and the violator remained in custody continuously from\nthat date until the conclusion of the final revocation hearing, the time\nassessments shall commence on the date of the execution of the warrant\nprovided, however, that time assessments will not be credited with any time in\nwhich the releasee is not within the convenience and practical control of the\n\nDepartment. (ii)\n\nWhere a parole\nwarrant was executed and the violator was ordered released by a court following\na recognizance hearing, the time assessments shall commence upon the date of\nthe issuance, by service on the violator, of a determination after a final\nhearing that the person has violated one or more conditions of release.The time\nassessments shall be credited with any time the violator spent in custody\nbetween the date the warrant was executed and the date of the recognizance\nhearing. (iii)\n\nWhere the revocation\ncase was commenced and no parole warrant was executed, the time assessments\nshall commence upon the date of the issuance of a determination after a final\nhearing that the person has violated one or more conditions of\nrelease. (iv)\n\nWhere the releasee\nhad been committed to the custody of the sheriff within New York State pursuant\nto Article 530 of the Criminal Procedure Law, any such time the person spent\nconfined in a correctional facility or local correctional facility following\nexecution of the parole warrant or service of the notice of violation, as the\ncase may be, to the date of the final hearing, shall be credited toward the\ntime assessment. (3)\n\nThe\ndate of the issuance of a determination after the final hearing within the\nmeaning of this section shall not be until such date as both the completed\nparole revocation decision has been issued and the releasee is within the\nphysical custody and control of the Department to commence the period of\nreincarceration as of such date. The Department shall have a reasonable amount\nof time under the totality of circumstances in which to enforce the time\nassessments imposed in the cases referenced in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of\nparagraph (2) of this section and shall have no such obligation during any\nperiod in which the releasee is outside of the convenience and practical\ncontrol of the Department or is alleged to have absconded from\nsupervision. (4)\n\nAny time\nassessments imposed within the same revocation case shall run concurrently with\none another. (5)\n\nFor any time\nassessments imposed, if the time remaining on the sentence is less than the\ntime assessments specified by the presiding officer, such assessments shall be\ndeemed a hold to the maximum expiration of the sentence. (6)\n\nWithin this section and section\n8005.20, sentence shall include\nsentence and post release supervision time, if any. (c) (1)\n\nEligibility for re-release. All parole violators identified as eligible for\nre-release as defined by subdivision (a) of this section, will be re-released\nto parole supervision as soon as practicable after completion of the delinquent\ntime assessment imposed irrespective of whether they are in State or local\ncustody. If, at the completion of the delinquent time assessment imposed, the\nparole violator is serving the balance of a definite sentence of incarceration, the parole warrant will be lifted upon completion of the delinquent time\nassessment. However, when presented with one or more of the following\ncircumstances, the board of parole will consider the violator's re-release\npursuant to subdivision (d) this section: (i) the parole violator has engaged in behavior, which constitutes a violation of\nfacility rules or has been found guilty of having violated such\nrules; (ii)\nthe parole violator has\nexperienced a significant change in his/her emotional/mental state (which may\nbe evidenced by the parole violator's transfer to a psychiatric ward or\nfacility, his/her commitment to a mental hygiene facility, or his/her placement\non a suicide watch or functional equivalent); (iii)\nthe parole violator was\narrested/convicted of a new felony subsequent to the final parole revocation\nhearing; or\n(iv)\nthe board receives\nany information that supports a reasonable conclusion that the parole violator\nmay not be suitable for re-release. Such information shall include, but not be\nlimited to, information pertaining to self-destructive or threatening behavior\nby the parole violator. (d) Consideration by the parole\nboard. (1)\n\nParole violator in local\ncustody. If at any time preceding the expiration of the time assessment\nimposed, the parole violator is identified as an exception for re-release\neligibility under subdivision (c) of this section and the parole violator\nremains in local custody, the violator will be considered for re-release by the\nboard upon the violator's return to a State correctional facility. Such\nconsideration shall be through an interview by a panel of two or more members\nof the board of parole as soon as practicable from the time of the violator's\nreturn to State custody. When the Board of Parole considers the parole violator\nfor re-release, there shall be no presumption, express or implied, favoring the\nviolator's re-release. (2)\n\nParole\nviolator in State custody. If at any time preceding the expiration of the time\nassessment imposed, the parole violator is identified as an exception for\nre-release eligibility under subdivision (c) of this section and the parole\nviolator is incarcerated in a State correctional facility, then the following\nrules shall apply: (i) Consideration by the\nboard of parole of a violator in State custody may be conducted by one or more\nmembers of the board during the two-month period immediately preceding the\nexpiration of the time assessment without a personal interview. (ii)\n\nAfter considering a parole violator who\nis in State custody for re-release, the board member or members will make one\nof two possible determinations as follows: (a) the board may direct that the violator be re-released to supervision upon\nexpiration of the time assessment after a satisfactory release program is\ndeveloped and approved; or\n(b) the\nboard may require that a personal interview be conducted between a panel of two\nor more members of the board and the parole violator. When the board requires a\npersonal interview, such interview shall be conducted within a reasonable time. When, after such interview, the board again considers the parole violator for\nre-release, there shall be no presumption, express or implied, favoring the\nviolator's re-release. (iii)\n\nGrounds for requiring a personal\ninterview. Any one of the following circumstances may serve as a ground for the\nboard to require an interview between the panel of the board and the parole\nviolator: (a) the parole violator has engaged\nin behavior which constitutes a violation of facility rules or has been found\nguilty of having violated such rules; (b) the parole violator has experienced a\nsignificant change in his/her emotional/mental state (which may be evidenced by\nthe parole violator's transfer to a psychiatric ward or facility, his/her\ncommitment to a mental hygiene facility, or his/her placement on a suicide\nwatch or functional equivalent); (c) the parole violator was\narrested/convicted of a new felony subsequent to the final parole revocation\nhearing; (d) escape, absconding or\nremoval from temporary release; or\n(e) the board receives any information that\nsupports a reasonable conclusion that the parole violator may not be suitable\nfor re-release. Such information shall include, but not be limited to, information pertaining to self-destructive or threatening behavior by the\nparole violator. (e) Inapplicability to certain cases. The provisions of this section shall be inapplicable to any\nparole violator whose eligibility for parole release is governed by the\nstatutory requirements of a new sentence. (f) Interim procedures for certain\ncases. For those parole violators whose time assessments expired\nprior to the effective date of this section, or will expire within 90 days\nafter the effective date of this section, the provisions of subdivisions (c)\nand (d) of this section shall be deemed to be modified as follows: consideration by the board will be conducted as soon as practicable following\nadoption of this section, but may occur after expiration of the time\nassessment. This section shall not be construed to afford any parole violator a\nright to release from custody upon expiration of the time assessment, but only\na right to consideration by the board as soon as practicable.
