Tit. 9 § 137.1 - Living quarters rates\n\nState Regulations\n\nFair values of living quarters are established according to\nlocation, type, size and quality of accommodations. Agencies are responsible\nfor applying location and quality classifications as defined in this section. However, classifications which have been previously established shall not be\nrevised without prior approval of the Director of the Budget. Exceptions to\nthis section are made only by the Director of the Budget. (a) Location classifications. Rents vary depending in part on the location of the\nresidence. The four location classifications to be used in computing rents are\ndefined as follows: Metropolitan\n-\nNew York City and all residences and State properties\nclassified as urban/suburban within Rockland, Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk\n\nCounties. Urban/Suburban\n-\nresidences located in or within 10 miles of communities\nwith over 50,000 population, as determined by the latest Federal census. Town/Village\n-\nresidences in or within 10 miles of communities with\n50,000 population or less, as determined by the latest Federal census. Rural\n-\nresidences located more than 10 miles from any\ncommunity. (b) Quality ratings. Rents also depend in part on their quality. Residential\nquality is identified by one of the following four classifications: Quality\nrating\n\nDefinition\n\nExcellent\n\nThe residence provides privacy and comfortable living\nin all major respects. Good\n\nThe residence has some limitations on privacy or\nprovides comfortable living in most major respects. Fair\n\nThe residence has substantial limitations on privacy or\nfails to provide comfortable living in only some respects. Poor\n\nThe residence lacks a minimal amount of privacy or\nfails to provide comfortable living in most major respects. The location of a residence is not considered in determining\nthe quality rating as it affects the privacy of the occupants. (c) Monthly room rates. (1)\n\nBy applying the location classification\ndetermined in accordance with subdivision (a) of this section, and the quality\nrating determined in accordance with subdivision (b), the monthly room rate for\na particular residence can be obtained from the following table: MONTHLY ROOM RATES\n(i) Rates effective September 26, 1985.
