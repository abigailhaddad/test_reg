Where prior approval of medical, dental and remedial care, services or supplies is required under the MA\nprogram, such prior approval will be granted when the medical, dental and\nremedial care, services or supplies are shown to be medically necessary to\nprevent, diagnose, correct or cure a condition of the recipient which: (1)\ncauses acute suffering; (2)\nendangers life; (3)\nresults in illness or\ninfirmity; (4)\ninterferes with the\ncapacity for normal activity; or\n(5)\nthreatens to cause a significant\nhandicap. (b) Purpose. (1)\n\nThe department, as the single State\nagency supervising the administration of the MA program, has entered into an\ninteragency agreement with the Department of Health whereby that department\nwill review and approve selected medical, dental and remedial care, services\nand supplies prior to their being furnished. The purpose of this process is to\nassure that: the requested medical, dental and remedial care, services or\nsupplies are medically necessary and appropriate for the individual recipient's\nmedical needs; other adequate and less expensive alternatives have been\nexplored and, where appropriate and cost effective, are approved; the request\ndoes not exceed benefit limitations as promulgated by the department; and the\nmedical, dental and remedial care, services or supplies to be provided conform\nto accepted professional standards. The department shall not allow exceptions\nto defined benefit limitations. (2)\n\nUnder the interagency agreement with the Department of Health, that department\nreviews and determines the medical necessity and appropriateness of the\nmedical, dental and remedial care, services or supplies to be provided. However, as the single State agency supervising the administration of the MA\nprogram, the department retains the authority and responsibility to exercise\nadministrative discretion in the supervision of the program and make decisions\nwith respect to the application of the rules, regulations and policies of the\nMA program. (c) Scope. This Part sets forth the requirements and procedures for obtaining prior\napproval of medical, dental and remedial care, services or supplies under the\nMA program, except for transportation, orthodontics, home health care, personal\ncare, and out-of-State services.

This Part does not govern the\nrequirements and procedures for obtaining prior authorization of medical, dental and remedial care, services or supplies under the MA program as may be\nrequired by this Title. Prior authorizations must be obtained in accordance\nwith the specific procedures described in this Title governing the care, services and supplies subject to prior authorization. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n513.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
