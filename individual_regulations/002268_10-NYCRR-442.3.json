The assumption is that the\nhospital will continue to function indefinitely. It then becomes necessary to\ndivide the life of the hospital into reporting periods, to determine revenues\nearned and expenses incurred during each period and to measure the amounts of\nassets and obligations at the end of each period. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n442.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
