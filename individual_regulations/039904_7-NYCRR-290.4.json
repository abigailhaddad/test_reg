  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 290.4 - Application and appeal process\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department's central office computer identifies those\ninmates at each facility who presently are eligible and reviewable for a\npossible LCTA approval. An otherwise eligible inmate may be considered for LCTA\napproval when he or she is within seven months of his or her LCTA conditional\nrelease date. However, eligible inmates will only be screened for reviewability\nwhen they have been in the department's custody for two years. On a monthly\nbasis, each facility, through its computer capability, will print the list of\nthose inmates who have been determined to be both eligible and suitable to\napply for the LCTA benefit. The name of an otherwise eligible inmate will not\nappear on the LCTA list if such inmate had a recommended loss of good time\nsanction within the five-year period prior to his or her LCTA date. The Deputy\n\nSuperintendent for Program Services, or designee, will forward the LCTA list to\nthe facility law library. The law library officer will provide a Form #4120, \"Application for Limited Credit Time Allowance,\" to any interested and eligible\ninmate whose name appears on the LCTA list. The application is a two-sided\ndocument. It is the sole responsibility of the eligible inmate to complete an\nLCTA application and submit it to his or her assigned Offender Rehabilitation\n\nCoordinator. The Offender Rehabilitation Coordinator will review the\napplication in accordance with the disciplinary evaluation criteria and the\nprogram evaluation criteria. A separate review by the Limited Credit Time\n\nAllowance Committee will be required in any case where the inmate received a\nrecommended loss of good time sanction for an incident that occurred more than\nfive years prior to such inmate's LCTA date. Any application that is denied at\nthe facility level may be appealed by the inmate to the commissioner's office\nwithin 30 days of receipt. If the denial is based upon the inmate's\ndisciplinary record, it shall be forwarded to the Director of Special\n\nHousing/Inmate Disciplinary Programs, as the commissioner's designee. If the\ndenial is based upon a failure to satisfy program requirements, the appeal\nshall be forwarded to the Director of Guidance and Counseling, as the\ncommissioner's designee. An application that is approved through all levels of\nreview at the facility must then be submitted for final review by central\noffice. The decision of central office either to approve or disapprove the LCTA\napplication is final. An inmate may not further appeal an LCTA denial by\ncentral office. The commissioner may revoke, at any time, LCTA credit for any\ndisciplinary infraction committed by the inmate or any failure to continue to\npursue his or her Earned Eligibility Plan/Program Plan. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n290.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
