Tit. 17 § 131.6 - Accommodation of utilities on highways with full control of access\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\naccommodation of utilities on highways with full control of access, where\napplicable, shall be subject to title 23 of the Code of Federal Regulations, part 645, in particular, 23 CFR sections\n645.209\nand\n645.211. This publication may be inspected at the department's main office located in\n\nBdlg. 5, Rm. 414, State Campus, Albany, NY 12232 and obtained through the U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC. Any permit issued by the department\nmay contain additional provisions to insure that the utility facility or its\ninstallation does not interfere with the free and safe flow of traffic, otherwise impair the highway or conflict with its maintenance, or conflict with\napplicable laws or regulations. (b) Utilities should when feasible install line crossings widely spaced to serve\nconsumers in general areas along either or both sides of the highway to\nminimize the number of crossings. (c) In appropriate situations and due to\nsevere economic hardship and infeasibility of the application of this section, the department in its discretion may apply any or all of the provisions in\nsection\n131.8\nof this Part to\ninstallations on highways with full control of access. (d) The department reserves the right to\nenter into an agreement for a joint use occupation of highway right-of-way\nwhich agreement may provide for compensation to the department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n131.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
