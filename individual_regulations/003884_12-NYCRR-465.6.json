Requests for access to records shall be in writing. (b) The records access officer has the\ndiscretion to designate the office of the administrative assistant or any other\noffices as the appropriate place at which requests for access to records may be\nmade. (c) The request for access to\nrecords should be sufficiently detailed to identify the record. Where possible, the requester should supply the case number assigned to the file which contains\nthe record. (d) The records access\nofficer shall respond to a request for access to a record within five business\ndays after receipt of the request. If, for any reason, more than five business\ndays are required to respond to such a request, receipt of the request shall be\nacknowledged within five business days. The acknowledgement shall state an\nestimate of the date when a reply will be made. When the requested record is\navailable for access, the records access officer shall so advise the\nrequester. (e) Other than hearing\ntranscripts, no part of a case file may be removed by the requester from the\nlocation where access is granted unless the records access officer has\ndetermined that such removal does not jeopardize the preservation and\nsafekeeping of the record. Hearing transcripts may be removed subject to such\nconditions as the records access officer may, from time to time, establish. (f) When a record is\nmade available for access, the requester shall be required to sign an\nacknowledgement that access was granted within any closure or confidentiality\nrulings which have been established.
