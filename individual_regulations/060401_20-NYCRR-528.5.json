Prosthetic aids, hearing aids, eyeglasses and artificial\ndevices and component parts thereof, purchased to correct or alleviate physical\nincapacity in human beings are exempt from the tax. (b) Qualifications. (1)\n\nIn order to qualify as a prosthetic aid, a hearing aid, eyeglasses or an artificial device, the property must either\ncompletely or partially replace a missing body part or the function of a\npermanently inoperative or permanently malfunctioning body part and must be\nprimarily and customarily used for such purposes and not be generally useful in\nthe absence of illness, injury or physical incapacity. Example 1: Artificial hands, arms, legs, false teeth, etc. are\nexempt. Example 2: Breast forms for post-mastectomy patients are exempt from\ntax.

Example 3: Cardiac pacemakers are exempt. Example 4: A crown which is permanently attached to a tooth by a\ndentist is exempt. Example 5: Sound amplification devices for hard-of-hearing people used\nwith telephones or television sets are exempt. Example 6: Specialized equipment used by the hearing impaired that\nconverts teletype signals into telephone signals and telephone signals into\nteletype signals and thus enables a hearing impaired person to communicate by\ntelephone, are exempt.

If\ntangible personal property is sold with special controls, lettering or devices, and the additional charge for the added features is separately stated on the\nbill for the tangible personal property, that portion of the sales receipts\nattributable to the added features is exempt. In determining whether the extra\namount charged for the special controls, lettering or devices is reasonable, like items exclusive of the added features should be compared with the same\nitem with the added features. Example 14: If a TV is sold with a closed captioned device built in, the portion of the price attributable to the closed captioned device, if\nseparately stated on the bill, can be deducted from the selling price before\ncomputing the tax.
