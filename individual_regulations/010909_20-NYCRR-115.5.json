Tit. 20 § 115.5 - Limitation\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 615(f)\n(a) The New York itemized deduction allowable\nunder section\n615 (a)\nof the Tax Law (see\nsection\n115.1\nof this Part) shall be reduced by the sum of the amounts determined under\nparagraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. (b) For taxable years beginning in 1989 and\nthereafter. (1)\n\nAn amount equal to the\nitemized deduction otherwise allowable under section\n615 (a)\nof the Tax Law (see\nsection\n115.1\nof this Part) multiplied by 25 percent, the product of which is multiplied by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the lesser of $50,000; or\n(i) for an unmarried individual, other than a\nhead of household or a surviving spouse, or married individual filing a\nseparate New York State personal income tax return, the excess of such\nindividual's New York adjusted gross income over $100,000; (ii)\nfor a married individual filing a joint\n\nNew York State personal income tax return or a surviving spouse, the excess of\nsuch individual's New York adjusted gross income over $200,000; (iii)\nfor an individual who is a head of\nhousehold, the excess of such individual's New York adjusted gross income over\n$150,000; and the denominator of which is $50,000. (2)\n\nAn amount equal to the\nitemized deduction otherwise allowable under section\n615 (a)\nof the Tax Law (see\nsection\n115.1\nof this Part) multiplied by 25 percent, the product of which is multiplied by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the lesser of $50,000 or the excess of such\nindividual's New York adjusted gross income over $475,000, and the denominator\nof which is $50,000. (c) The provisions of this section may be illustrated for each filing status by the\nfollowing formulas (as used in these formulas\nNYAGI\nmeans New\n\nYork adjusted gross income and\nNYID\nmeans New York itemized\ndeduction): (1)\nfor tax years beginning in\n1989 and thereafter: (i) where New York\nadjusted gross income does not exceed $475,000; (a) married filing jointly or surviving\nspouse\nNYID × 25% ×\nlesser of $50,000 or\n(NYAGI-$200,000)\n/\n$50,000\n(b) head of household\nNYID × 25% ×\nlesser of $50,000 or\n(NYAGI-$150,000)\n/\n$50,000\n(c) unmarried individual or married filing\nseparately\nNYID × 25% ×\nlesser of $50,000 or\n(NYAGI-$100,000)\n/\n$50,000\n\nExample: A taxpayer filing as a head of household for the calendar\nyear 1992 has New York adjusted gross income of $230,000 and total New York\nitemized deduction, before this limitation, of $40,000. The portion of the New\n\nYork itemized deduction disallowed is computed as follows: $40,000 × 25% ×\nlesser of $50,000 or\n($230,000-$150,000)\n/\n$50,000\n=\n$40,000 × 25% ×\nlesser of $50,000 or\n$(80,000)\n/\n$50,000\n=\n$40,000 × 25%\n×\n$50,000\n/\n$50,000\n=\n$10,000 × 1 = $10,000 itemized deductions\ndisallowed. (ii)\nwhere New York adjusted gross income exceeds $475,000, the following formula is\nused for all filing statuses; NYID × 25% + (NYID × 25% ×\n(lesser of $50,000\nor (NYAGI - $475,000)))\n/\n$50,000\n\nExample: A husband and wife filing a joint 1992 New York State\nresident personal income tax return have New York adjusted gross income of\n$530,000 and total New York itemized deduction, before this limitation, of\n$100,000. The portion of their New York itemized deduction disallowed is\ncomputed as follows: $100,000 × 25% + ($100,000 × 25% ×\n(lesser\nof $50,000 or ($530,000 -\n$475,000)))\n/\n$50,000\n=\n$25,000 + ($100,000 × 25% ×\n(lesser of\n$50,000 or $55,000))\n/\n$50,000\n=\n$25,000 + ($100,000 × 25%\n×\n($50,000))\n/\n$50,000\n=\n$25,000 + ($100,000 × 25% × 1) =\n$25,000 + $25,000 = $50,000 itemized deductions\ndisallowed.
