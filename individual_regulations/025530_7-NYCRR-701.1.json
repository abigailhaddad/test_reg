Tit. 7 § 701.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The inmate\ngrievance program (IGP) provides each inmate an orderly, fair, simple and\nexpeditious method for resolving grievances, pursuant to section\n139\nof the Correction Law, and allegations\nof discriminatory treatment, pursuant to 9 NYCRR Part\n7695. (b) This program is intended to supplement, not replace, existing formal or informal channels of problem resolution as set\nforth in section\n701.3\n(a) of this Part.

If not satisfied, an inmate may appeal\nto the facility superintendent; if still not satisfied, an inmate may appeal to\na committee of central office staff acting on behalf of the commissioner: the\ncentral office review committee (CORC). (d) Facilities such as camps, shock\nincarceration correctional facilities, alcohol and substance abuse treatment\ncenters, and work release facilities may follow the modified plan set forth in\n\nPart 702 of this Title when approved by the director, IGP.
