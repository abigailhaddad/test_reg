  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 29.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nBanking Law, section 112 authorizes banks and trust companies\nto declare dividends in a calendar year without having obtained the prior\napproval of the superintendent out of net profits for that calendar year\ntogether with retained net profits for the immediately preceding two calendar\nyears. The Banking Department formerly has computed \"net profits\" by adding\nback to net income any provision made for loan losses and deducting any net\nlosses charged to the loan loss reserve. This procedure is inconsistent with\nthe recognition of losses under generally accepted accounting principles\n(\"GAAP\"). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n29.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
