  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 165.4 - Inspection Type and Frequency\n\nState Regulations\n\nBridge inspections shall fall into one or more of the\nfollowing categories: (a) General\n\nInspection. A general inspection is the regularly scheduled inspection which\neach bridge receives throughout its life and which focuses on bridge condition, ability to function, safety and maintenance issues, and produces the basic\nstatistical data necessary to understand, study, monitor and manage all bridges\nsubject to this Code. Where applicable, a general inspection shall be scheduled\nduring periods of low water in order to minimize the need for a diving\ninspection. There are two (2) types of general inspections, ''biennial\ninspections'' and ''interim inspections'' as follows: (1)\n\nBiennial Inspections. All bridges subject\nto the provisions of the Code shall receive a biennial inspection which is to\nbe performed at least once every two years. In addition: (i) All bridges open to highway traffic while\nundergoing repair, reconstruction or rehabilitation shall continue to receive\nbiennial inspections during such construction when due. (ii)\n\nAll new bridges, reconstructed bridges, and rehabilitated bridges shall receive a biennial inspection within 60 days of\nformal project acceptance or fully opening the bridge to highway traffic, whichever occurs first. (2)\n\nInterim Inspections. All bridges subject\nto the provisions of the Code which meet one or more of the following criteria\nshall receive an interim inspection: (i) All\nbridges which are posted for load capacity below the State unrestricted legal\nload limit as a result of an engineering analysis that results in the load\nrestriction. (ii)\n\nAll bridges which\nreceived a General Recommendation, a s defined by the current Department Bridge\n\nInspection Manual, of three (3) or less during their most recent general\ninspection. (iii)\n\nAll bridges which\ncarry an active structural flag, as defined by the Department's ''Inspection\n\nFlagging Procedure for Bridges''. (iv)\n\nAll bridges for which the entity with\ninspection responsibility determines that it is appropriate. Interim\ninspections shall be performed at or near one year after each biennial\ninspection. Bridges ope n to highway traffic while undergoing repair, reconstruction or rehabilitation shall receive an interim inspection when due. A program of scheduled special inspections may be\nsubstituted for interim inspections. In such cases, the inspection scope, schedule and findings must be documented and clearly demonstrate that the basis\nthat is the cause for an interim inspection is being addressed. In no case\nshall such special inspections occur at an interval exceeding that required by\nan interim inspection. (b) Diving Inspection. A bridge subject to\nthe provisions of the Code shall be designated as a bridge requiring diving\ninspection if it meets one or more of the following diving criteria: (1)\nA bridge with any portion of a\nsubstructure exposed to water deeper than six (6.0) feet, during periods of\nnormal low water, shall be designated for diving inspection; (2)\nA bridge with any portion of a\nsubstructure exposed to water deeper than three (3.0) feet, but no deeper than\nsix (6.0) fee t, during periods of normal low water, may or may not be\ndesignated as a b ridge requiring inspection by divers depending on the\njudgment of the responsible professional engineer in charge of diving\ninspection activity. In making this determination, the responsible professional\nengineer shall take into consideration, among other factors, structure type, materials of construction, foundation type, footing location relative to\nchannel bottom, known or suspected problems, waterway characteristics, superstructure and substructure redundancy, etc. In making this evaluation and\nresulting determination, existing bridge records, including existing inspection\ninformation shall be reviewed; (3)\nA bridge with no portion of any substructure unit exposed to three (3.0) feet\nor more of water, during periods of normal low water, will normally not be\ndesignated for diving inspection. Diving inspections may be performed as part of a general\ninspection, in-depth inspection, special inspection or as an independent\ninspection effort. When making determinations on the need for diving\ninspection, it must be recognized that bridges are constructed of differing\nstructural configurations and situated in widely varying environments. This\nresults in varying degrees of inspection difficulty, complexity, structural\nredundancy and structural sensitivity. Portions of the diving inspection\ncriteria intentionally leave discretion to provide for proper bridge-by-bridge\nevaluation of the above and other factors in determining the need f or a diving\ninspection. Diving inspections shall be performed at maximum inspection\nintervals of sixty (60) months. However, it shall be determined, on a\nbridge-bybridge basis, if a ''complete'' or ''partial'' diving inspection is\nneeded on a more frequent basis. If it is determined that more frequent diving\ninspections are needed, they shall be scheduled. (c) In-Depth Inspection. An in-depth\ninspection is a comprehensive detailed inspection of an entire bridge which\nfrequently incorporates destructive, as well as, non-destructive inspection\ntechniques. It is more complete and more intensive than a general inspection\nand th e results of such an inspection can be used to satisfy the Code\nrequirements for a general inspection. In-depth inspections are performed on an\n' 'as needed'' basis to assist in making bridge rehabilitation versus\nreplacement decisions, and to assist in the development of bridge\nrehabilitation design. (d) Special\n\nInspection. A special inspection is a unique inspection effort targeted at\nspecial situations or conditions and may be performed to study a unique or\nunusual bridge feature in greater detail than would have normally occurred\nduring a general inspection. A special inspection may also be performed to\nmonitor the condition of a specific bridge detail or situation on a repetitive\nbasis and shall be performed whenever the structural integrity of a bridge is\nor has been threatened by a storm, flood, natural phenomenon, accident or man\nmade occurrence. Due to the wide variability of situations and conditions\nrequiring a special inspection, there can be no predetermined schedule or\nfrequency interval for the performance of special inspections. Frequency\nintervals are determined based on the particular parameters of the different\nsituations and conditions under consideration. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
