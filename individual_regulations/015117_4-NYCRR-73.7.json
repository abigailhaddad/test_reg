  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 § 73.7 - Effective date of coverage\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon\nthe approval of the application of any authority, corporation, district, agency, subdivision, or organization for the inclusion of its employees and/or\nprior retirees in the plan, it shall become a participating employer, and the\npresident shall thereupon fix an effective date for the commencement of\ncoverage of such employees and/or prior retirees, as the case may be. Such\neffective date shall be fixed with due regard to a reasonable time allowance\nneeded for educational, promotional and enrollment purposes and other\nadministrative requirements. The president may, in his discretion, fix a\nschedule of effective dates of coverage with respect to newly approved\nparticipating employers on a quarterly basis or at such other time intervals as\nhe may deem appropriate. (b) Notwithstanding such effective date for coverage as may be fixed by the\npresident and except as provided in this subdivision, coverage shall not become\neffective with respect to the employees of a participating employer unless 75\npercent of all persons eligible for coverage as employees of such participating\nemployer shall enroll for such coverage. If a participating employer provides\ncoverage for only a class of its employees designated by it in accordance with\nparagraph (a) of subdivision 2 of section 221 of the Insurance Law, the\ncoverage shall not become effective until 75 percent of the class shall enroll\nfor such coverage. If two or more classes of employees are covered\nsimultaneously, the 75 percent requirement shall apply to the total of such two\nor more classes which shall be considered one group. If a class of employees\nnot initially covered is subsequently extended the opportunity to enroll, then\n75 percent of the employees of that class must enroll for coverage before such\ncoverage can become effective for that class. If two or more classes not\ninitially covered are subsequently and simultaneously extended the opportunity\nto enroll, then the 75 percent requirement shall apply to the total of such two\nor more classes which shall be considered one group. For the purposes of this\nsubdivision, the prior retirees of a participating employer are deemed to be a\nclass. The president shall make the final administrative determination whether\nany purported class set forth in an application for coverage is a class\npermitted by law. No coverage shall become effective until the employer and\nemployee contributions therefor have been paid into the Health Insurance\n\nFund. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4\n§\n73.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
