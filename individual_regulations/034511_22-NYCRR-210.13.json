Tit. 22 § 210.13 - Exchange of medical reports in personal injury and wrongful death actions\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept where the court otherwise directs, in\nall actions in which recovery is sought for personal injuries, disability or\ndeath, physical examinations and the exchange of medical information shall be\ngoverned by the provisions hereinafter set forth: (a) At any time after joinder of issue\nand service of a bill of particulars, the party to be examined or any other\nparty may serve on all other parties a notice fixing the time and place of\nexamination. Unless otherwise stipulated, the examination shall be held not\nless than 30 nor more than 60 days after service of the notice. If served by\nany party other than the party to be examined, the notice shall name the\nexamining medical provider or providers. If the notice is served by the party\nto be examined, the examining parties shall, within 10 days of receipt thereof, submit to the party to be examined the name of the medical providers who will\nconduct the examination. Any party may move to modify or vacate the notice\nfixing the time and place of examination or the notice naming the examining\nmedical providers, within 10 days of the receipt thereof, on the grounds that\nthe time or place fixed or the physician named is objectionable, or that the\nnature of the action is such that the interests of justice will not be served\nby an examination, exchange of medical reports or delivery of\nauthorizations. (b) At\nleast 20 days before the date of such examination, or on such other date as the\ncourt may direct, the party to be examined shall serve upon and deliver to all\nother parties the following, which may be used by the examining medical\nprovider: (1)\ncopies of the\nmedical reports of those medical providers who have previously treated or\nexamined the party seeking recovery. These shall include a recital of the\ninjuries and conditions as to which testimony will be offered at the trial, referring to and identifying those X-ray and technicians' reports which will be\noffered at the trial, including a description of the injuries sustained, a\ndiagnosis, and a prognosis. Medical reports may consist of completed medical\nprovider, workers' compensation, or insurance forms that provide the\ninformation required by this paragraph; and\n(2)\nduly executed and acknowledged\nwritten authorizations permitting all parties to obtain and make copies of all\nhospital records and such other records, including X-ray and technicians'\nreports, as may be referred to and identified in the reports of those medical\nproviders who have treated or examined the party seeking recovery. (c) Copies of the\nreports of the medical providers making examinations pursuant to this section\nshall be served on all other parties within 45 days after completion of the\nexamination. These shall comply with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of\nthis section.

Copies of these reports and the\nrequired authorizations shall be served and delivered with the bill of\nparticulars by the party seeking to recover. All other parties shall serve\ncopies of the reports of their medical providers within 45 days thereafter. In\nany case where the interests of justice will not be promoted by service of such\nreports and delivery of such authorizations, an order dispensing with either or\nboth may be obtained. (e) Parties relying solely on hospital\nrecords may so certify in lieu of serving medical providers' reports. (f) No case otherwise eligible\nto be noticed for trial may be noticed unless there has been compliance with\nthis rule, or an order dispensing with compliance or extending the time\ntherefor has been obtained; or, where the party to be examined was served a\nnotice as provided in subdivision (a) of this section, and the party so served\nhas not responded thereto. (g) In the event that the party examined\nintends at the trial to offer evidence of further or additional injuries or\nconditions, nonexistent or not known to exist at the time of service of the\noriginal medical reports, such party shall, within 30 days after the discovery\nthereof, and not later than 30 days before trial, serve upon all parties a\nsupplemental medical report complying with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)\nof this section, and shall specify a time not more than 10 days thereafter and\na place at which a further examination may be had. Further authorizations to\nexamine and make copies of additional hospital records, other records, X-ray or\nother technicians' reports as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section must\nalso be delivered with the medical reports. Copies of the reports of the\nexamining medical providers, complying with the requirements of subdivision (c)\nof this section, shall be served within 10 days after completion of such\nfurther examination. If any party desires at the trial to offer the testimony\nof additional treating or examining medical providers, other than whose medical\nreports have been previously exchanged, the medical reports of such medical\nproviders, complying with the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section\nshall be served upon all parties of at least 30 days before trial. (h) Unless an order to the\ncontrary is made or unless the judge presiding at the trial in the interests of\njustice and upon a showing of good cause shall hold otherwise, the party\nseeking to recover damages shall be precluded at the trial from offering in\nevidence any part of the hospital records and all other records, including\nautopsy or post-mortem records, X-ray reports or reports of other technicians'\nnot made available pursuant to this rule, and no party shall be permitted to\noffer any evidence of injuries or conditions not set forth or put in issue in\nthe respective medical reports previously exchanged, nor will the court hear\nthe testimony of any treating or examining medical providers whose medical\nreports have not been served as provided by this rule. (i) Orders transferring cases\npending in other courts which are subject to the provisions of this section, whether or not such cases are consolidated with cases pending in the court to\nwhich transferred, shall contain such provisions as are required to bring the\ntransferred cases into compliance with this rule. (j) Any party may move to compel\ncompliance or to be relieved from compliance with this rule or any provision\nthereof, but motions directed to the sufficiency of medical reports must be\nmade within 20 days of receipt of such reports. All motions under this rule may\nbe made on affidavits of attorneys, shall be made on notice, returnable at the\nappropriate motion part and shall be granted or denied on such terms as to\ncosts, calendar position and dates of compliance with any provision of this\nrule as the court in its discretion shall direct. (k) Where an examination is\nconducted on consent prior to the institution of an action, the party to be\nexamined shall deliver the documents specified in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of\nthis section, and the report of the examining medical provider shall be\ndelivered as provided in subdivision (c) of this section. In that event, examination after institution of the action may be waived. The waiver, which\nshall recite that medical reports have been exchanged and that all parties\nwaive further physical examination, shall be filed with the note of issue. This\nshall not be a bar, however, to proceeding under subdivision (g) of this\nsection in a proper case. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
