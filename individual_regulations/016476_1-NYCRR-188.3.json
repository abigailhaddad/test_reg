  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 188.3 - Standard pack\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Heads of lettuce shall be fairly uniform in size, and fairly tightly to tightly\npacked, but not excessively tightly packed, in uniform layers in the container\naccording to the approved and recognized methods; except that in standard\nfiberboard containers, a \"bridge\" of six heads may be placed between the layers\nin a 2 1/2-dozen pack. (1)\n(i) Fairly uniform in size means that not\nmore than 10 percent, by count, of heads in any container may vary appreciably\nin size from the standard size head for the count pack. (ii)\n\nThe standard size head for a two-dozen\npack is that size head, having four wrapper leaves, which will pack tightly, but not excessively tightly, three rows with four heads of uniform size in each\nrow in a layer in a standard fiberboard container. Heads having lesser or\ngreater numbers of wrapper leaves which can be packed as specified herein are\nconsidered equivalent in size to a standard size head with four wrapper\nleaves. (2)\n\nExcessively\ntightly packed means that heads are packed so tightly as to cause distortion, or crushing of the heads or breaking of the midribs. (b) When heads of lettuce are wrapped, no\nhead may have more than one wrapper leaf. (c) In order to allow for variations incident\nto proper packing, not more than a total of 10 percent of the containers in any\nlot may fail to meet the requirements of standard pack. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n188.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
