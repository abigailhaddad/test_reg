  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 131.3 - A review of statutory authority of certain utilities to use State highway rights-of-way\n\nState Regulations\n\nUtilities organized pursuant to the Transportation\n\nCorporations Law (TCL), as described in section 3, subdivision 1, 2 or 6 of the\nTCL, utilities subject to article 28 of the Executive Law and such utility\ncorporations that are authorized pursuant to section 4 or 5 of the TCL that\nfurnish the same services, have certain rights based in statute to occupy\ncertain types of State highway rights-of-way, subject to conditions prescribed\nby the department, and subject to the right of the department to use its\nrights-of-way for all purposes authorized to it by law. In addition to the\nabove, utilities such as gas and electric corporations, article 2, TCL; telegraph and telephone corporations, article 3, TCL; and cablevision\ncorporations, article 28 of the Executive Law, have the legislated grant to\noccupy certain types of State highway rights-of-way without the payment of a\nuse and occupancy fee. In addition to the above first sentence, utilities such\nas pipe line corporations, article 7, TCL (a limited legislated grant to occupy\ncertain types of State highway rights-of-way); water-works corporations, article 4, TCL, district steam corporations, article 9, TCL, sewage-works\ncorporations, article 10, TCL; and utility corporations that are authorized\npursuant to section 4 or 5 of the TCL that furnish the same services; that are\nnot municipal corporations nor owned by a municipal corporation may occupy\ncertain types of State highway rights-of-way with the payment of any use and\noccupancy fee imposed by the department. Utilities owned by municipal\ncorporations, including public authorities, while enjoying no legislated grant\nto occupy the rights-of-way, have traditionally been authorized the right to\noccupy certain types of State highway rights-of-way, subject to conditions\nprescribed by the department, and to the right of the department to use its\nrights-of-way for all lawful purposes. Thus, such utilities in New York State, either operating under a franchise granted by law or pursuant to law, or a\npolitical subdivision of the State, use and occupy the State highway rights-of-\nway in furtherance of their legal obligations under the Public Service Law, article 28 of the Executive Law, or other statute to provide service to the\npublic. Utility facilities not serving the public, but devoted to private\npurposes, have no legislated right to occupy the State highway rights-of-way, however the department is authorized to permit private utilities to occupy the\n\nState highway rights-of-way and may issue a use and occupancy permit as\nprovided in this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n131.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
