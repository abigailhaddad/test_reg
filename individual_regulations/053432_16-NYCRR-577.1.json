  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 577.1 - Water plant to be recorded at original cost\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All amounts included in subaccounts\n1301-1336 of accounts 1101 to 1104 for water plant (except as otherwise\nprovided in account 1302, Franchises and Consents) shall be the original cost\n(see definition §\n575.1, subd. [a] [8]) of such\nwater plant. (See also paragraphs B and C of account 1106.)\n(b) When the term cost is used in the\ndetailed water plant accounts (1301- 1336), it shall mean the original cost\nunless otherwise specified and shall include not only the materials, supplies, labor, services and other items consumed or employed in the construction and\ninstallation of water plant, but also the cost of preliminary studies, plans, surveys, engineering, supervision, and general expenses, which contribute\ndirectly and immediately to water plant without duplication of such\ncost. (c) When the consideration\ngiven for property is other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be\ndetermined on a cash basis. In the entry recording such transaction the actual\nconsideration shall be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The utility shall be prepared to furnish the commission the particulars of its\ndetermination of the cash value of the consideration, if other than\ncash. (d) When property is\npurchased under a plan involving deferred payments, no charge shall be made to\nthe water plant accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures\noccasioned solely by such form of payment. (e) Water plant contributed to the utility or\nconstructed by it from contributions to it of cash or its equivalent shall be\ncharged to the water plant accounts at cost (see §\n575.1, subd. [a] [6]) to the\nutility (i.e., original cost less the portion thereof contributed by, or on\nbehalf of customers). Records shall be kept so that the utility can readily\nfurnish information as to the source, purpose, and amount of each contribution, the property to which each contribution relates, and the conditions, if any, upon which each contribution was made. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n577.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
