The corporation may request from a project sponsor: (1)\na written request from the project\nsponsor that the proposed project be listed in the DWIUP, if\neligible; (2)\na description of the\nproposed project, including its location, estimated cost, a project\nconstruction schedule that includes the estimated dates of construction\ncommencement and completion; (3)\na\ndescription of the need for the project; (4)\nthe economic development impact of the\nproposed project, including, but not limited to, the number of jobs estimated\nto be created or retained, the economic benefit to the State, and the costs and\nbenefits of the project; (5)\ninformation regarding the creditworthiness of the project sponsor, including\nfinancial statements and other relevant documents the corporation determines\nare necessary to determine such creditworthiness; (6)\ninformation regarding the project\nsponsor, including information on any past felony convictions and other crimes\nof moral turpitude; and\n(7)\nsuch\nother information as the corporation may deem necessary to determine the\nproject's eligibility for assistance from the fund. (b) In order to be considered to receive\nassistance from the fund, each project sponsor shall submit a completed\npre-application to the corporation prior to the pre-application deadline\ncontained in the notice described in section\n2605.4\nof this Part. (c) Following the pre-application deadline: (1)\n\nThe corporation will evaluate the\nreasonableness and viability of each of the projects for which a complete\npre-application has been submitted. In making such an evaluation, the\ncorporation shall consider such factors as the corporation deems necessary, including, without limitation, evaluating the creditworthiness and background\nof project sponsors, as well as consulting with DED and other State\nagencies. (2)\n\nThe corporation shall\nrequest that DOH determine whether each proposed project is eligible for DWSRF\nfinancing. For those projects deemed eligible for DWSRF financing, the\ncorporation shall request DOH to determine the DWSRF score and include the\nproject in the DWIUP with a notation that the eligible project may also be\neligible for assistance from the fund. Those eligible projects deemed\nineligible for DWSRF financing shall also be included with the DWIUP, as a\nseparate list, and clearly marked as only being eligible for assistance from\nthe fund. (3)\n\nFor any projects that\nwould create, construct or modify a public water system, the corporation shall\nrequest DOH to review such projects to ensure that such projects meet all\napplicable State and Federal regulations. (4)\n\nThe corporation shall also request that\nDEC review all pre-applications and determine whether any projects require any\nDEC permits or approvals. (5)\n\nThe\ncorporation may also seek other assistance it deems necessary to review the\nprojects for which pre-applications were submitted. (d) (1)\n\nOnce the corporation has completed its evaluation of the pre-applications, the\ncorporation shall forward a list of eligible projects to DED along with a\nstatement of the available funding period resources. (2)\n\nUsing the information obtained during the\npre-application period, DED will then recommend to the corporation the projects\nto be financed with the available funding period resources. In making this\nrecommendation, DED shall consider the number of jobs the project will create\nand/or retain, the costs and benefits of the eligible project as compared to\nother projects, the overall economic benefit of the project to the State and\nthe potential for the proposed project to enhance the State's technology\nindustry development effort, as well as any other criteria determined by DED to\nreflect the proposed project's potential benefits to the State. (3)\n\nAs part of this request, the corporation\nshall also request that DED prioritize the listed projects. (e) The corporation will review the\nlist of eligible projects compiled by DED and the recommendations. The\ncorporation will then make a final determination as to which projects will be\nprovided assistance from the fund based upon this determination and any other\nfactors that the corporation deems appropriate.
