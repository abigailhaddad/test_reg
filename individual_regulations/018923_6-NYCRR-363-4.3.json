Tit. 6 §§ 363-4.3 - Engineering report\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe engineering report must contain, at a minimum: (a) A site description and analysis of the\nproposed facility including the following: (1)\nA brief description of the type and amount of waste, in tons, accepted by the\nfacility, specifying the anticipated maximum amount of wastes to be accepted on\na daily and annual basis, including those wastes anticipated to be accepted for\nuse as alternative operating cover, the anticipated maximum in-place density of\nwaste to be placed in the landfill, and the proposed maximum amount of waste\nand alternative operating cover that will be placed in the landfill. (2)\nA description of the number, types and\nspecifications of all machinery and equipment needed to effectively operate the\nfacility at the proposed rate of waste acceptance, and all proposed structures\nand areas designated for unloading, processing, sorting, storage, and\nloading. (3)\nA description of the\nmaterials and construction methods that demonstrate compliance with the\nrequirements in Subpart 363-6 of this Part and are used for the placement of: (i) each monitoring well pursuant to the\nrequirements of section\n363-4.4\n(k) of this\n\nPart; (ii)\nthe landfill gas\nmanagement system; (iii)\nthe\nleachate conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal system; (iv)\nthe cover system; and\n(v) the liner and leachate collection and\nremoval system. The description must also include the precautions that will be\ntaken to prevent frost action upon the composite liner system in areas where\nwaste will not be placed within one year of department approval of construction\ncertification; (4)\nA\ndescription of post-construction care measures to be taken to ensure that the\nconstruction materials noted in paragraph (3) of this subdivision meet the\nspecifications and comply with the requirements of Subpart 363-6 of this Part\nfrom the time of construction completion to the beginning of landfill\noperation. (5)\nA comprehensive and\ndetailed description of each of the following features of the operation of the\nlandfill gas management system: (i) a\nyear-by-year estimate of the quantities of landfill gas that will be generated\nduring the active life and post-closure care period, including a year-by-year\nestimate of greenhouse gas emissions; (ii)\nhow landfill gas will be\nmanaged; (iii)\nhow any landfill gas\ncondensate generation will be minimized, disposed, and/or recirculated into the\nlandfill waste mass; (iv)\nall\nmachinery, equipment, and construction materials to be used at the facility, including the equipment design capacity; (v) how the landfill gas management system\nwill be designed, constructed and maintained so as not to interfere with the\nintegrity of the proposed or existing landfill final cover system; and\n(vi)\na description of how the\nlandfill gas management system will effectively control landfill decomposition\ngas-related odors. (b) A landfill liner subbase settlement\nanalysis that: (1)\npredicts the total and\ndifferential settlement of the landfill subbase, liner, leachate collection and\nremoval system, and other critical containment structure components of the\nlandfill demonstrating that the liner system and leachate collection and\nremoval system will maintain their integrity and performance at the maximum\npredicted settlements. The calculated settlement should account for secondary\nconsolidation for a period of 30 years after the estimated closure date of the\nfacility; (2)\nincludes plan and\ncross-sectional views depicting the predicted maximum critical landfill subbase\nsettlement elevations and the landfill liner and leachate collection and\nremoval system elevations when the subbase settlement analysis predicts\nsettlement exceeding one foot. In all cases, the slope must not be less than\none percent for pipe valley areas and two percent for liner subbase areas; and\n(3)\nincludes a landfill\nsettlement monitoring plan when the landfill subbase settlements are predicted\nto exceed one foot. The landfill settlement monitoring plan must be designed to\ndemonstrate that the leachate collection and removal system is functioning as\ndesigned and to verify acceptable integrity of key leachate collection and\nremoval system and conveyance appurtenances within the system. (c) A structural integrity and\noverall slope stability analysis. The analysis must demonstrate the structural integrity\nand overall stability of the landfill site, the subgrade, each component of the\nliner, leachate collection and removal system, and final cover system, and must\ninclude: (1)\n\nAn evaluation of the\nfollowing failure modes: (i) overall global\nstability of the waste mass and foundation soils; (ii)\nlocal and deep stability along critical\ninterfaces of the liner and final cover system, including veneer stability of\nthe leachate drainage and protective cover soil layers above liners and along\ndrainage soil layers and geosynthetic interfaces within the landfill final\ncover system for anticipated field conditions. The analysis must identify the\nshear strength properties necessary to meet the requirements of paragraph (3)\nof this subdivision; and\n(iii)\nlocal and global stability of access routes, leachate storage tanks, landfill\naccess ramps, retaining walls, and other applicable facility components\ncritical to operation, closure and monitoring of the facility. (2)\n\nAn evaluation of site\ngeometries, impacts of pore pressures and loading conditions: (i) during construction of the liner and\nfinal cover system; (ii)\nduring\nfilling or excavating of waste in the landfill, including the typical\nstockpiling of materials, overfilling and other interim conditions; (iii)\nat full load conditions represented by\nattaining the landfill's maximum design capacity; and\n(iv)\nassociated with leachate recirculation, if proposed. (3)\na\ndemonstration that the design considers an appropriate selection of shear\nstrengths based on the variability of materials the potential for mobilization\nof post-peak displacement shear strengths. The potential pore pressure regimes\ncaused by liquid buildup, seepage forces, and landfill gas pressures should\nalso be considered and the system should achieve the following factors of\nsafety under static stability conditions: (i) a minimum factor of safety of 2.00 for the subgrade soil-bearing capacity of\nany loaded structures or appurtenances (e.g., tanks, manholes, retaining walls, etc.) associated with the landfill at full load conditions. (a) If the factor of safety for the\nsoil-bearing capacity is less than 3.00, it must be demonstrated that the\nstructures or appurtenances can accommodate the anticipated settlements over\nthe life of the facility; (ii)\na minimum factor of safety of 1.25 for\nthe design of the facility liner and leachate collection and removal system\ncomponents for short-term conditions considering the maximum anticipated\nconstruction and early landfill operational transient loads; (iii)\na minimum factor of safety of 1.50 for\ninterim and final elevation of waste slopes that occur during operation and\nupon closure of a landfill cell; and\n(iv)\na minimum factor of safety of 1.50 for\nthe final cover system considering seepage patterns that will typically develop\nassuming the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the barrier protection and\ntopsoil layers during the wettest months of the year. (d) a seismic stability analysis. Any facility located in a seismic impact zone, as defined in section\n360.2, must include a seismic\nstability analysis. The seismic stability analysis must address the serviceable\nlife of the landfill, its internal components and its related appurtenances and\nmust demonstrate that: (1)\nall long-term\ncontainment structures, including liners, the leachate collection and removal\nsystem, and the surface water control system but excluding the cover system, are stable by utilizing either: (i) a\npseudo-dynamic analysis, requiring both the static and pseudo-static analyses\nto be based on large-displacement shear strengths (3 inch) along the critical\nsurface, that demonstrates all long-term containment structures are designed to\nretain a minimum factor of safety of 1.0 using a seismic coefficient (expressed\nas a fraction of the acceleration of gravity) equal to 0.75 of the free field\npeak ground acceleration at the site for the design earthquake (i.e., the\nearthquake that has a 10 percent or greater probability in 250 years or two\npercent or greater probability in 50 years in the lithified earth from the\nlatest USGS seismic hazard map or site specific seismic hazard study); or\n(ii)\na displacement analysis\nthat limits the calculated permanent seismic deformations to less than six\ninches using a decoupled seismic response/deformation analysis, to resist the\nmaximum horizontal acceleration for the site. If the computed displacement is\ngreater than 0.4 inch then large-displacement shear strengths (3 inch) must be\nused for both the static and the dynamic analysis. (2)\nthe landfill's long-term containment\nstructures and any related appurtenances are not susceptible to damage from\nliquefaction when subjected to the maximum horizontal acceleration in lithified\nearth. (e) A description\nand analysis of the leachate collection and removal system that includes: (1)\n\nAn evaluation of leachate generation\ndata, including: (i) an estimate of the\nleachate generation quantities for the landfill, based on the maximum hydraulic\ninfiltration rate using a 24-hour 25-year storm, assuming little or no waste in\nplace in the landfill; (ii)\nan\nevaluation of impacts on the portion of the landfill's leachate collection and\nremoval system, that does not have intermediate or final cover material placed, which would result from a 500-year storm and provide discussion of mitigating\nprocedures to any impacts; and\n(iii)\nfor landfill expansions or landfills\nundergoing subsequent development, an analysis of the anticipated increase\nabove the existing landfill's actual leachate generation as a result of the\nexpansion and/or subsequent development. (2)\nA description of how the components of\nthe landfill liner and leachate collection and removal system will: (i) withstand dynamic and static loading\nstresses anticipated during the construction, operation, closure, post-closure\nperiod of the facility, including subsequent permit modifications that involve\nchanges in waste types and vertical expansion designs; (ii)\nallow for effective monitoring of\nleachate flow and liner system performance in accordance with paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision; and\n(iii)\nallow\nfor effective access for routine maintenance. (3)\n\nAn estimate of the maximum daily volume\nof leachate generated, and a demonstration that the leachate head on the\nprimary liner system will not exceed 12 inches per the provisions of paragraph\n363-6.6(a)(3), and that the maximum daily volume of leachate that may\ninfiltrate through the primary liner will not exceed the allowable primary\nliner leakage rate of 20 gallons per acre per day in accordance with provisions\nof paragraph 363-7.1(f)(7). (f) Design information for a\nstormwater/run-off conveyance system. This information must demonstrate that\nthe stormwater detention/retention basin system is designed to manage a\n100-year, 24hour design storm from the landfill site without sustaining damage. This must include an evaluation of impacts on the stormwater/run-off conveyance\nsystem which would be anticipated as from a 500-year storm to inform a\ncontingency plan for such an event. (g) a mined use plan. (1)\n\nIf the facility plans to use material\nexcavated on-site as operating cover for the landfill, and construction of that\nlandfill will not take place in the area from which the operating cover\nmaterial is to be removed, the facility must submit a mined land use plan with\ninformation that demonstrates compliance with the applicable requirements of\n\nPart 422 of this Title. (2)\nA mined\nland use plan is not required if the facility plans to perform on-site\nexcavation of material to be used as operating cover for the landfill and the\nlandfill footprint will be situated upon the area from which the operating\ncover material is to be removed. (3)\n\nMaterial excavated on-site may not be\nused off-site unless the applicant has first obtained a mining permit pursuant\nto Part 421 of this Title; (h) Facility closure and post-closure design\nplan. The facility's closure and post-closure design plan must include at a\nminimum: (1)\nclosure design; (2)\npost-closure water quality monitoring\nprogram; (3)\nan operation and\nclosure plan for the leachate collection, treatment, and storage\nfacilities; (4)\nan operation and\nclosure plan for the landfill gas management system; and\n(5)\nany proposed and alternative end uses for\nthe site.
