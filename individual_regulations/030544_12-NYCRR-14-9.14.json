  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.14 - Superheater safety valves\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every attached superheater shall have one or more safety valves near the\noutlet. If the superheater outlet header has a full, free, steam passage from\nend to end and is so constructed that steam is supplied to it at practically\nequal intervals throughout its length so that there is a uniform flow of steam\nthrough the superheater tubes and the header, the safety valve, or valves, may\nbe located anywhere in the length of the header. (b) The discharge capacity of the safety\nvalve, or valves, on an attached superheater may be included in determining the\nnumber and size of the safety valves for the boiler, provided there are no\nintervening valves between the superheater safety valve and the boiler, and\nprovided the discharge capacity of the safety valve, or valves, on the boiler, as distinct from the superheater, is at least 75 percent of the aggregate valve\ncapacity required. (c) Every\nindependently fired superheater which may be shut off from the boiler and\npermit the superheater to become a fired pressure vessel shall have one or more\nsafety valves having a discharge capacity equal to six pounds of steam per\nsquare foot of superheater surface measured on the side exposed to the hot\ngases. In the case of electrically heated superheaters, the safety valve\ncapacity shall be based upon 31/2 lb/hr/kw input. The number of safety valves\ninstalled shall be such that the total capacity is at least equal to that\nrequired. (d) A soot-blower\nconnection may be attached to the same outlet from the superheater that is used\nfor the safety-valve connection. (e) (1)\n\nEvery safety valve used on a superheater discharging superheated steam at a\ntemperature over 450 Fahrenheit shall have a casing, including the base, body, bonnet and spindle, of steel, steel alloy- or equivalent heat-resisting\nmaterial. (2)\n\nThe valve shall have\na flanged inlet connection, or a welding end inlet connection. It shall have\nthe seat and disk of suitable heat erosive and corrosive-resisting material, and the spring fully exposed outside of the valve casing so that it shall be\nprotected from contact with the escaping steam. (f) Every reheater shall have one or more\nsafety valves, such that the total relieving capacity is at least equal to the\nmaximum steam flow for which the reheater is designed. At least one valve shall\nbe located in the steam flow path between the reheater outlet and the first\nstop valve. The location shall be suitable for the service intended and shall\nprovide the overpressure protection required. The pressure drop upstream of\neach safety valve shall be considered in the determination of set pressure and\nrelieving capacity of that valve. The relieving capacity of that valve shall be\nnot less than 15 percent of the required total. The capacity of reheater safety\nvalves shall not be included in the required relieving capacity for the boiler\nand superheater. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
