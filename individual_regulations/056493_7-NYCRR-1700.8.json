  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 1700.8 - Payment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Valuation and\nproper amount to be paid. The value of lost or destroyed property shall be a\nreasonable level of compensation, considering the age, condition, original cost\nand market value of the lost item(s). For damaged property, the value is the\nlower of: the cost to repair or restore the property to its condition at the\ntime of loss; or the cost to replace the property considering its age and\ncondition. (1)\n\nThe proper amount to be paid\nshall be no more than the reasonable value of the property. (2)\n\nIf the value of an item which the inmate\nwas permitted to possess exceeds the limitations contained in department\ndirectives 4911, 4912, or 4913, then the proper amount to be paid for that item\nis no more than the amount of the applicable limitation. If the lost or damaged\nitem was in the department's control because the inmate was not permitted to\npossess it, then the amount to be paid for the loss of the item may exceed the\nlimitations of the directives. (3)\n\nItems of sentimental or artistic value. It is not possible to evaluate the\n\"sentimental value\" of items such as personal photographs, writings, mementos, or the \"artistic value\" of personal artwork or handicrafts. Such items can only\nbe evaluated for their intrinsic value unless there is some proof of actual\nmarket value such as an appraisal of a painting. (4)\n\nLost legal papers often have no value. If\nrecords in a criminal case are lost when there is no further right of appeal\nand no further use for them, then the records have no more than \"sentimental\nvalue,\" that is, no value. If the lost legal papers can still be used, for\nexample, in a pending or future legal proceeding, then the loss may be\ncompensated by either replacing the papers or paying the reasonable cost to\nreproduce them. If an inmate can obtain replacement copies for no cost, then\nthe lost papers have no value. If an inmate claims that there is a cost to\nreproduce the lost papers, then the inmate should produce an estimate for the\ncost to reproduce the lost papers, which normally should not exceed the cost\nshown in the bill for the original papers. (5)\n\nAll claims submitted which refer to\nartwork created by an inmate will be reimbursed only for the cost equal to the\nmaterials required to create the artwork. (b) Amount of payment. (1)\n\nThe amount paid should not exceed the\namount requested by the inmate. However, the reviewer may approve payment of an\namount less than that requested by the inmate. If the inmate accepts an offer\nof a lesser amount, the claim will be processed for that amount. If the inmate\ndoes not respond to the offer within 14 days, it will be deemed a rejection of\nthe offer and the claim will be considered closed. (2)\n\nThe amount of any payment must be reduced\nby the amount of any insurance payment or other compensation received from\nother sources by the inmate. (3)\n\nThe proper amount to be paid shall be further reduced by the percentage of the\ninmate's comparative liability. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
