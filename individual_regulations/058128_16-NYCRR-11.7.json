A current charge for purposes of this section means\nthe amount properly billed the owner, etc., for utility service used during the\nmost recent service billing period covered by the first bill rendered on or\nafter the date when the termination, disconnection or suspension notice is\nissued. The current charges will not include any arrears for earlier billing\nperiods that may appear on such a bill.
