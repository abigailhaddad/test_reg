  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 701.5 - Procedure\n\nState Regulations\n\nNote: If an inmate is deaf or hard-of-hearing, any expression of\ndifficulty in communicating or understanding shall be considered a request for\nassistance. Reasonable accommodations (including assignment of a sign language\ninterpreter, if needed, and a grievance clerk) will be made to ensure the\ninmate's full access to all steps in the grievance process. (a) Filing the complaint. (1)\n\nTime limit for filing. An inmate must\nsubmit a complaint to the clerk within 21 calendar days of an alleged\noccurrence on an inmate grievance complaint form (form #2131). If this form is\nnot readily available, a complaint may be submitted on plain paper. The\ncomplaint may only be filed at the facility where the inmate is housed even if\nit pertains to another facility. Note: Exceptions to this time limit or any appeal time limits may\nbe approved by the IGP supervisor under section\n701.6\n(g) of this Part. (2)\n\nContents. In addition to the grievant's name, department identification number, housing\nunit, program assignment, etc., the grievance should contain a concise, specific description of the problem and the action requested and indicate what\nactions the grievant has taken to resolve the complaint, i.e., specific persons/areas contacted and responses received. The IGP supervisor\nshall review the grievance complaint and designate the grievance code and\ntitle. If the IGP supervisor determines that the grievance may be a harassment, discrimination or strip frisk/strip search grievance, it shall be processed in\naccordance with the respective expedited procedure (section\n701.8, 701.9\nor\n701.10\nof this Part). The clerk shall consecutively number and log each grievance at\nthe time of receipt. (3)\n\nLike\ngrievances. \"Like grievances\" may be consolidated at the option of the IGP\nsupervisor or IGRC and assigned one grievance calendar number. The first\ncomplaint received will be given the next sequential grievance number in the\nclerk's log (form #2136). The grievants shall select three or four\nspokespersons from their number to be grievants of record and to represent them\nat the hearing and to ensure expeditious processing of the cases. Any like\ncomplaint submitted at this time or during processing may be addressed under\nthe same grievance calendar number. A list of the names of every inmate who\nsubmitted a complaint on the issue shall be included with the grievance\nmaterials and submitted with any appeal which may result. Every effort will be\nmade to notify all of the grievants of the response at each level to which the\ngrievance is appealed either by written response, posting on inmate bulletin\nboards or radio announcement. Not every complainant may receive an individual\nwritten response, but the three or four grievants of record will. If none of\nthe grievants of record appeal to the next level, any inmate who submitted a\ncomplaint may continue the appeal. Any inmate on the list of those submitting\nthe complaint will be given the number of the grievance of record to submit to\nthe court in order to verify exhaustion of the IGP. (b) First step, IGRC. (1)\n\nInformal resolution. The representatives\nof the IGRC shall have up to 16 calendar days after a grievance is filed to\nresolve it informally. If the matter is resolved to the satisfaction of the\ngrievant, the resolution and the grievant's consent must be entered on the\ninmate grievance complaint form. (2)\nIGRC hearing. (i) If there is no resolution, the full\ncommittee shall conduct a hearing to answer the grievance or make a\nrecommendation to the superintendent. (ii)\n\nThe clerk, together with the staff, shall schedule the hearing to take place within 16 calendar days after receipt\nof the grievance, making certain that the grievant and all direct parties and\nwitnesses, if any, are afforded an opportunity to appear (except as exempted in\nsection\n701.7\n[d]\nof this Part). (a) Any inmate whose\nconfinement status precludes his/her attendance at an IGRC hearing and who will\nbe released within 30 calendar days shall be given the option of having the\nhearing held in his/her absence or postponed until release from confinement. The grievant's decision shall be obtained in writing. If the grievant is not\nscheduled for release from confinement within 30 calendar days, the hearing\nshall be held in his/her absence. If any person elects not to appear, the clerk\nshall so inform the IGRC. (b) If a\ngrievant does not appear for the hearing without a legitimate reason (visit, parole hearing, program committee, sick call, keeplock, etc.), the IGRC will\nhold a hearing in absentia. The IGRC has the authority in this circumstance to\ndismiss and close the grievance by majority vote (3 of 4), or to make a\nrecommendation on the action requested and forward same to the\ngrievant. (c) If a grievant misses\nthree scheduled hearings due to legitimate reasons, the IGRC shall act on the\ngrievance at the third scheduled hearing. (iii)\n\nThe full IGRC shall conduct the hearing\nat the time and place set. The grievant or his/her advisor and any other direct\nparty to the grievance may present relevant information, comments, or other\nevidence in furtherance of their respective positions. The IGRC shall be the\njudge of the relevance and materiality of the evidence offered. (3)\n\nCommittee\ndecision/recommendation. (i) After the\nchairperson closes the hearing, the committee shall deliberate in private\nsession. Its decision must be communicated to the grievant and any direct party\nin writing with reasons stated, within two working days. In its discretion, the\nIGRC may also communicate its decision to the grievant orally immediately after\nits deliberations. (ii)\n\nMatters\nwhich neither require superintendent/central office action nor involve changes\nin policy may be resolved by agreement of the committee, the inmate, and the\nparty directly affected. Committee decisions which do require superintendent or\ncentral office action, including, but not limited to, changes in institutional\nor departmental policy or procedure, shall be written in the form of\nrecommendations and referred to the superintendent. Any matter on which the\ncommittee cannot reach a decision by majority vote shall also be referred to\nthe superintendent for action and response. (4)\n\nDismissals. (i) The IGRC may dismiss and close a\ngrievance after a hearing if it determines, by majority vote (3 of 4), that: (a) the grievant has made no effort to\nresolve the complaint through existing channels; (b) the grievant has not been or will not be\npersonally affected by the issue in his/her complaint; (c) the grievant is seeking a decision or an\nappeal of a decision otherwise attainable through the established procedures\nfor: (1)\ntemporary release, family reunion and\nmedia review programs; (2)\ndisciplinary and time allowance committee proceedings; (3)\ncentral monitoring (CMC), inmate claims, or record's review (freedom of information requests, expunction) procedures; or\n(4)\nany other program or\nprocedure having a written appeal mechanism which extends review to outside the\nfacility (see section\n701.3\n[e]\nof this Part); (d) the\ngrievant is seeking action with respect to any policy, regulation, rule or\naction of an agency not under the supervision of the Commissioner of\n\nCorrectional Services (see section\n701.3\n[f]\nof this Part); or\n(e) the grievance\nis institutional in nature and only affects or no longer affects a grievant who\nhas been released or paroled (see section\n701.6\n[i]\nof this Part). (ii)\n\nIn\nsuch cases, the IGRC shall clearly cite the portions of this section and of\nsection\n701.3\n(a), (b), (e) and\n(f), or\n701.6\n(i) of this Part which provide the basis for dismissal, and shall, where\nappropriate, refer the grievant to appropriate existing mechanisms. (iii)\n\nIf a grievant believes that a dismissal\nin his/her case is not authorized by this directive, he/she may apply directly\nto the facility IGP supervisor for review within seven calendar days after\nreceipt of the IGRC's decision to dismiss the grievance. If the supervisor\ndetermines that the grievance does not fall into one of the categories cited in\nthis section, then the grievance will be returned to the IGRC for a hearing and\nrecommendation. The supervisor's written response shall be forwarded to the\ngrievant within seven calendar days of receipt. An inmate may pursue a\ncomplaint that the IGP supervisor failed to reinstate an improperly dismissed\ngrievance by filing a separate grievance. (iv)\n\nIf there is less than a majority vote to\ndetermine whether a complaint constitutes a grievable issue, the IGRC will hear\nthe grievance and provide its recommendations with reasons stated on the\nspecific requested action(s). (c) Second step, appeal to the\nsuperintendent. (1)\n\nFiling an appeal. If the grievant or any direct party wishes to appeal to the superintendent, he\nor she must complete and sign the appeal section on the IGRC response form\n(form #2131) and submit it to the grievance clerk within seven calendar days\nafter receipt of the IGRC's written response. If no appeal is filed upon denial\nby the IGRC, it will be presumed that the grievant or direct party accepts the\ncommittee's recommendation. An exception to this appeal time limit may be\napproved by the IGP supervisor under section\n701.6\n(g) of this Part. (2)\n\nReferral to the\nsuperintendent. In all cases where action by the superintendent is required, the grievance papers and all relevant supplemental data shall be transmitted to\nthe superintendent. Such transmittal shall be within one working day after\nreceipt of an appeal. (3)\n\nSuperintendent's action. The superintendent's office shall date stamp all\ngrievances forwarded showing when they were received. The superintendent or his\ndesignee shall determine if the grievance is departmental in nature. (i) Departmental issue. If a matter concerns\nan altering or revision of a departmental policy/directive, the superintendent\nshall promptly forward the grievance papers and a recommendation regarding said\npolicy to the IGP supervisor for forwarding to the CORC which shall render a\ndecision in accordance with the third step. Such transmittal must be within\nseven calendar days from the time the appeal was received. The grievant, the\ngrievance clerk, and the direct party, if any, shall receive notice of said\ntransmittal. Departmental issues which do not involve creation or revision of a\ndepartmental policy or directive shall be answered by the superintendent within\n20 calendar days from the time the appeal was received. (ii)\n\nInstitutional issue. If a matter\nconcerns an institutional issue, the superintendent shall render a decision on\nthe grievance and transmit said decision, with reasons stated, to the grievant, the grievance clerk, and direct party, if any, within 20 calendar days from the\ntime the appeal was received. (4)\n\nImplementation of decisions. The IGP\nsupervisor or the superintendent must verify compliance with superintendents'\nresponses that require some form of implementation. Documentation of compliance\nmust be filed with the grievance record. If a decision is not implemented\nwithin 45 days, the grievant may appeal to CORC citing lack of implementation\nas a mitigating circumstance. (d) Third step, appeal to the central\noffice review committee (CORC). (1)\n\nAppeal. (i) If the grievant or any direct\nparty wishes to appeal to the CORC, he or she must complete and sign form #2133\nand submit it to the grievance clerk within seven calendar days after receipt\nof the superintendent's written response to the grievance. The superintendent's\nresponse form contains simple directions for appeal to the CORC. An exception\nto this appeal time limit may be approved by the IGP supervisor under section\n701.6\n(g) of this Part. (ii)\n\nThe grievance\nclerk shall transmit the signed appeal and the accompanying grievance papers to\nthe IGP supervisor within one working day after receipt of the signed appeal\nstatement. The supervisor must forward appeals within seven calendar days to\nthe CORC. (2)\n\nThe CORC. (i) The CORC shall consist of the deputy\ncommissioner and counsel, deputy commissioner for correctional facilities, deputy commissioner for program services, deputy commissioner for\nadministrative services, and the deputy commissioner and chief medical officer, or their designees expressly authorized to act for them. A representative of\nthe office of diversity management will attend CORC hearings and have input on\ngrievances alleging discrimination, but will not vote. (ii)\n\nThe CORC functions on behalf of the\ncommissioner and under his authority. CORC decisions have the effect of\ndirectives. Decisions requiring remedial action must be implemented by the\nfacility and/or departmental office to which they apply. (iii)\n\nThe director, IGP, is not a voting\nmember of the CORC. The director will, however, be responsible for the\nadministrative function of the IGP. The director, IGP, as the commissioner's\ndesignee, shall ensure implementation of CORC decisions. (3)\nCORC action. (i) The IGP central office staff shall date\nstamp all appeals showing when they were received and shall notify facility\ngrievance staffs in writing as grievances are received.
