  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.10 - Soil drainage layers\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to the requirements of subdivision\n363-6.6\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart, all soil drainage material used in the primary and secondary leachate\ncollection and removal systems of the landfill must conform to the following\nrequirements. (a) Materials required. The soil drainage layer must be free of any organic material, have less than\nfive percent by weight pass the No. 200 sieve after placement, and have no more\nthan 15 percent calcium carbonate equivalent as determined by appropriate test\nmethods using a solution with a pH representative of landfill\nleachate. (b) Construction\nrequirements. (1)\n\nThe soil drainage layer\nmust be placed in a manner to minimize defects to the underlying geomembrane or\nother geosynthetic materials. (2)\n\nThe soil drainage layer must be placed in a manner to achieve a minimum slope\nof two percent. (c) Certification requirements. (1)\n\nThe project\nengineer must approve the quality control testing results of any soil drainage\nmaterials and ensure that the materials meet the placement, hydraulic\nconductivity, and thickness requirements of section\n363-6.6\nof this Subpart and the\nrequirements of subdivision\n363-6.10\n(a) of\nthis section. (i) A particle size analysis of\nthe soil drainage layer material must be submitted to the project engineer for\napproval for each borrow source prior to installation, and during installation\nat a frequency of at least one test for every 1,000 cubic yards of material\nplaced. (ii)\nA laboratory\nconstant-head permeability test for a soil drainage layer sample must be\nsubmitted to the project engineer for approval for each borrow source prior to\ninstallation and at a frequency of at least one test for every 2,500 cubic\nyards of material delivered, and after placement at a frequency of at least one\ntest for every 2,500 cubic yards of material placed. (iii)\n\nThe project engineer must certify that\nthe requirements of subdivision\n363-6.10\n(a) and\nsection\n363-6.6\n(a)(3) and\n(4)\nof this Subpart are met. (2)\n\nThe project engineer must\ncertify that post-construction care procedures are carried out which, at a\nminimum, protect the soil drainage layers from fines related to water and\nwind-borne sedimentation. (3)\n\nQuality assurance testing must ensure that the material is placed in accordance\nwith the requirements of the engineering drawings, reports, and\nspecifications. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
