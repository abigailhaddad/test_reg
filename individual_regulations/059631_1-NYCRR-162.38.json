  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 162.38 - Provolone cheese standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. New York State Seal of Quality provolone cheese must be made using\nonly New York State milk and must meet the fat and moisture standards as set\nforth in section 17.64 of this Title, for provolone cheese. The determination\nof the Seal of Quality grade of provolone cheese shall be on the basis of\nrating (A) flavor, (B) body and texture, (C) color, (D) finish and appearance. The rating of each quality factor shall be established on the basis of\ncharacteristics present in cheese from any sample. The final grade shall be\nestablished on the basis of the lowest rating of any one of the quality\ncharacteristics. Seal of Quality provolone cheese shall conform to the\nfollowing requirements and standards: (1)\n\nFlavor. Shall possess desirable and pleasing flavor and odor characteristics. It may possess bitter, metallic/oxidized, and unclean type flavors, upon\ncritical examination, to a very slight degree. It may possess acid and cooked\ntype flavors to a slight degree. Cheese may have a flat and salt flavor to a\ndefinite degree. A salt flavor cannot be to the extent that the natural cheese\nflavor is masked over. Provolone cheese may not possess fermented, rancid, or\nyeasty flavors to any degree. A smoked cured provolone cheese may possess a\ndefinite smoke flavor and odor. (2)\n\nBody and texture. Provolone cheese of this grade shall have uniform firmness on\nall sides. The texture must be smooth, with the exception that a slight\nroughness to the surface due to salt may be apparent. The texture and body of\nthe cheese should be smooth and springy, very close and uniform, and not have a\ncorky or curdy appearance. The cheese must be devoid of free fat on the\ninterior surfaces. In addition, the cheese must be free of any evidence of gas\nformation and a few slits may be noted in the interior, however, such slits\nshall not be the result of gas formation. A slight difference in degree of\nfirmness will be allowed between the rind which should not exceed 1/2 inch and\nthe interior of the cheese. In both fresh and aged provolone, a definite degree\nof stringiness shall be apparent upon critical examination. This stringiness\nwill be less apparent in an aged cheese. (3)\n\nColor. Cheese may be white to a light\ncreamy color but should not have a dull chalky appearance. The color may be\nslightly wavy in appearance. The surface of the cheese should have a glossy\nsheen. Any mottling or unnatural coloration shall not be present. (4)\n\nFinish and appearance. The wrapper or\ncovering shall adequately and securely envelop the cheese, be neat, unbroken\nand fully protect the surface but may be slightly wrinkled. The basic shape of\nthe cheese shall be reasonably uniform throughout. Ends may be slightly\nrounded. Huffing due to gas formation during curing is unacceptable. To a\nslight degree, cracks could be present on the surface. There shall not be any\nmold on the surface or within the cheese. (b) Flavor. (1)\n\nVery slight. Barely detectable upon\ncritical examination. (2)\n\nSlight. Detected only upon critical examination. (3)\n\nDefinite. Not intense but\ndetectable. (4)\n\nPronounced. So\nintense as to be easily identified. (5)\n\nAcid. May be slight if cheese is aged\nover one week. Sharp and puckery to the taste, characteristics of lactic\nacid. (6)\n\nBitter. Distasteful, similar to taste of quinine. May be present in cheese one week or more\nold. (7)\n\nFlat. Insipid, lacking in\nflavor development, devoid of flavor. Present most likely if cheese is less\nthan one week old. (8)\n\nCooked. Mildly suggestive of uncleanliness in addition to a whey taint. (9)\n\nMetallic/oxidized. Flat, metal-like taste\nand puckery sensation. (10)\n\nRancid. Characterized by: (i) a slow reaction\ntime; (ii)\nits prominence after the\nsample is expectorated; and\n(iii)\nits persistence. The flavor is bitter, soapy, very disagreeable and\nrepulsive. (11)\n\nYeasty. Identified by its sour, yeasty taste and slightly fragrant\nodor. (c) Body and\ntexture. (1)\n\nSmooth. Feels silky; not dry and\ncoarse or rough. (2)\n\nFirm. Feels\nsolid and offers slight resistance to pressure. The rind will be somewhat\nfirmer than the interior of the cheese. (3)\n\nOpen. Mechanical openings that are\nirregular in shape and are caused by workmanship and not gas\nfermentation. (4)\n\nWeak. Requires\nlittle pressure to crush, is soft but is not necessarily sticky like a pasty\ncheese. (5)\n\nPasty. Usually weak\nbody and when the cheese is rubbed between the thumb and fingers it becomes\nsticky and smeary. (6)\n\nGassy. Gas\nholes of various sizes and may be scattered. (7)\n\nSlits. Narrow or elongated openings\ngenerally associated with cheese that is gassy or yeasty. (8)\n\nCorky. Dry, hard, overfirm, stiff, tough. (9)\n\nCurdy. Characteristic of\nfreshly made or uncured cheese. Cheese is hard and when pressure is applied\nthere is a tendency for the cheese to spring back to its original\nshape. (10)\n\nFree fat. Greasy or\noily presence on the cheese that can be felt or is visible. (d) Color. (1)\n\nUncolored. Absence of artificial\ncoloring. (2)\n\nWavy. Unevenness of\ncolor which appears as layers or waves. (3)\n\nMottled. Rounded, irregularly shaped\nareas of light and dark shades of color. (4)\n\nUnnatural. Color that is not normally\nassociated with provolone cheese. (e) Finish and appearance. (1)\n\nRind. Hard coating caused by the\ndesiccation of the surface of the cheese. (2)\n\nFirm sound rind. Possessing a firmness\nand thickness (not easily dented or damaged) consistent with the size of the\ncheese and which is dry, smooth, and closely knit, sufficient to protect the\ninterior quality from external defects; free from checks, cracks, breaks or\nsoft spots. (3)\n\nWrapper or\ncovering. Transparent or opaque material (plastic film type or foil) next to\nthe surface of the cheese, used as an enclosure or covering of the\ncheese. (4)\n\nAdequately and securely\nenveloped. Wrapper or covering properly sealed, and entirely enclosing the\ncheese, with sufficient adherence for ample protection and prevention of\nmold. (5)\n\nSmooth bright surface. Clean, glossy surface. (6)\n\nSoiled\nsurface. Milkstone, rust spots or other discoloration on the surface of the\ncheese. (7)\n\nSmooth surface. Not\nrough or uneven. (8)\n\nSurface mold. Mold on the exterior of the cheese. (9)\n\nMold under wrapper or covering. Mold\nspots or areas that have formed under the wrapper or on the cheese. (10)\n\nRough surface. Lacks\nsmoothness. (11)\n\nLopsided. One side\nof the cheese is higher than the other side. (12)\n\nHigh edge. A rim or ridge on the\nfollower side of the cheese, which is raised in varying degrees. In extreme\ncases it may bend over. (13)\n\nCracks\nin the rind. Openings or breaks in the rind. (14)\n\nChecked rind. Numerous small cracks or\nbreaks in the rind, sometimes following the outline of curd particles sometimes\nreferred to as \"curd openings\". (15)\n\nSoft spots. Soft to the touch and the\nspots are usually faded and moist. (16)\n\nHuffed cheese. Swollen because of gas\nfermentation. The cheese becomes rounded or oval in shape instead of being\nflat. (17)\n\nWeak rind. Thin and\npossessing little or no resistance to pressure. (18)\n\nSour rind. A fermented rind condition, usually confined to the faces of the cheese. (19)\n\nWet rind. A wet rind is one in which the\nmoisture adheres to the surface of the rind and which may or may not soften the\nrind or cause discoloration. (20)\n\nRind rot. Soft spots on the rind that have become discolored and have decayed\nor decomposed. (21)\n\nSlightly\nwrinkled. Not more than 25 percent of the surface shall be dimpled and/or\nwrinkled. (f) Processing\nfacility. Seal of Quality cheese manufacturing and packaging is restricted to\nthose facilities in compliance with Agriculture and Markets Law, article 4 or\n12-A and these facilities must maintain a satisfactory inspection\nrecord. (g) Packing. All packages\nshall be subject to approval by the Department of Agriculture and Markets. Package approval shall be based upon the ability of the package to maintain the\nquality standards and integrity of the product. (h) Markings. Each package of provolone\ncheese packaged and offered for sale under the Seal of Quality program must\nhave affixed the official seal designation and comply with the requirements set\nforth in section 17.64 of this Title.
