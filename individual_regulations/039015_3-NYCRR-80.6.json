  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 80.6 - Adjustments to rate, payment, balance or term\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept for such further limitations on adjustments (i.e., \"\nceilings\", \"floors\" or \"initial discounts\") as may be set forth in the loan\ncontract: (a) (1)\nadjustments to the interest rate shall\ncorrespond directly to the movement of an interest-rate index or of an index\nthat measures the rate of inflation, which index is readily available to and\nverifiable by the borrower and is beyond the control of the lender; provided\nthat a lender may decrease the interest rate at any time, and provided further, that interest rate adjustments may be rounded to the nearest fraction of a\npercentage point when so stated in the contract. A lender may also increase the\ninterest rate pursuant to a formula or schedule that specifies the amount of\nthe increase, the time at which it may be made, and which is set forth in the\nloan contract; (2)\nadjustments to\nthe monthly payment and loan balance may be made to reflect interest- rate\nadjustments and, in the case of a payment adjustment, where the adjustment\nreflects change in the loan balance or is made pursuant to a formula or\nschedule specifying the percentage or dollar change in the payment, as set\nforth in the contract; (3)\nany\ncombination of indices or a moving average of index values may be used as an\nindex, but a lender may not change or reserve the right to change the index or\nindices specified in the loan contract unless the initial index or indices\nspecified become(s) unavailable during the term of the loan; and\n(4)\nthe loan term may be adjusted only to\nreflect a change in the interest rate, the payment or the loan\nbalance. (b) Mortgage\nbankers. (1)\n\nMortgage bankers may use any\nsingle index from among the indices approved by the Superintendent of Banks\npursuant to Superintendent's Regulations, Part 334, on such terms as stated\ntherein. Adjustments in the rate for the loan shall correspond directly to the\nmovements of the index. As provided in section\n590-a\n(3)\nof the Banking Law, the interest rate of\nthe junior mortgage loan must be reduced in proportion to any decrease in the\nindex rate, while increases in the interest rate based upon changes in the\nindex rate may be made at the option of the mortgage banker. Although any loan\nmay only use a single index for the life of the loan, the mortgage banker may\nprovide for the use of an index similar to the index actually used in the event\nthat the latter index should become unavailable for use during the term of the\nloan. (2)\n\nThe loan contract may\nprovide for payment adjustments to be made pursuant to a formula or schedule\nspecifying the percentage or dollar change in the payments. The loan term may\nbe adjusted only to reflect a change in the interest rate and adjustments to\nthe payment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
