  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 382.80 - Classification of waste for disposal in land disposal facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Considerations. Determination of the classification of radioactive waste\ninvolves two considerations. First, consideration must be given to the\nconcentration of long-lived radionuclides (and their shorter-lived precursors)\nwhose potential hazard will persist long after such precautions as\ninstitutional controls, improved waste form and deeper disposal have ceased to\nbe effective. These precautions delay the time when long-lived radionuclides\ncould cause exposures. In addition, the magnitude of the potential dose is\nlimited by the concentration and availability of the radionuclide at the time\nof exposure. Second, consideration must be given to the concentration of\nshorter-lived radionuclides for which requirements on institutional controls, waste form, and disposal methods are effective. (b) Classes of waste. (1)\n\nClass A waste is waste that is usually\nsegregated from other waste classes at the disposal site. The physical form and\ncharacteristics of Class A waste must meet the minimum requirements set forth\nin section\n382.81\n(a) of this\n\nPart. If Class A waste also meets the stability requirements set forth in\nsection\n382.81\n(b) of this\n\nPart, it is not necessary to segregate the waste for disposal. (2)\n\nClass B waste is waste that must meet\nmore rigorous requirements on waste form to ensure stability after disposal. The physical form and characteristics of Class B waste must meet both the\nminimum and stability requirements set forth in section\n382.81\nof this Part. (3)\n\nClass C waste is waste that not only must\nmeet more rigorous requirements on waste form to ensure stability but also\nrequires additional measures at the land disposal facility to protect against\ninadvertent intrusion. The physical form and characteristics of Class C waste\nmust meet both the minimum and stability requirements set forth in section\n382.81\nof this Part. (4)\n\nWaste that is not generally acceptable\nfor disposal at a land disposal facility is waste for which waste form and\ndisposal methods must be different, and in general more stringent, than those\nspecified for Class C waste. In the absence of specific requirements in this\n\nPart, proposals for disposal of this waste may be submitted to the department\nfor approval, pursuant to section\n382.83\nof this Part. (5)\n\nExcept for NARM waste contaminated with\nradium-226 and its decay products, NARM waste will be classified pursuant to\nsection\n382.83\nof this Part and not\npursuant to section\n382.80\n(f). NARM\nwaste contaminated with radium-226 and its decay products will be classified\npursuant to subdivisions (c), (e), (g) and (h) of this section. (c) Classification\ndetermined by long-lived radionuclides. If radioactive waste contains only radionuclides listed\nin Table 1, classification will be determined as follows: (1)\n\nIf the concentration does not exceed 0.1\ntimes the value in Table 1, the waste is Class A. (2)\n\nIf the concentration exceeds 0.1 times\nthe value in Table 1, but does not exceed the value in Table 1, the waste is\n\nClass C. (3)\n\nIf the concentration\nexceeds the value in Table 1, the waste is not generally acceptable for\ndisposal at a land disposal facility. (4)\n\nFor wastes containing mixtures of\nradionuclides listed in Table 1, the total concentration will be determined by\nthe sum-of-fractions rule described in subdivision (g) of this\nsection. (d) Classification determined by short-lived radionuclides. If radioactive waste does not contain any of the\nradionuclides listed in Table 1, classification will be determined based on the\nconcentrations shown in Table 2 as follows. However, as specified in\nsubdivision (f) of this section, if radioactive waste does not contain any\nradionuclides listed in either Table 1 or 2, it is Class A. (1)\n\nIf the concentration does not exceed the\nvalue in column 1 of Table 2, the waste is Class A. (2)\n\nIf the concentration exceeds the value in\ncolumn 1 of Table 2, but does not exceed the value in column 2, the waste is\n\nClass B. (3)\n\nIf the concentration\nexceeds the value in column 2 of Table 2, but does not exceed the value in\ncolumn 3, the waste is Class C. (4)\n\nIf the concentration exceeds the value in column 3 of Table 2, the waste is not\ngenerally acceptable for disposal at land disposal facilities. (5)\n\nFor wastes containing mixtures of the\nradionuclides listed in Table 2, the total concentration will be determined by\nthe sum-of-fractions rule described in subdivision (g) of this\nsection. (e) Classification determined by both long and short-lived\nradionuclides. If radioactive waste contains a mixture of radionuclides, some of which are listed in Table 1, and some of which are listed in Table 2, classification will be determined as follows: (1)\n\nIf the concentration of a radionuclide\nlisted in Table 1 does not exceed 0.1 times the value listed in Table 1, the\nclass will be that determined by the concentration of radionuclides listed in\n\nTable 2. (2)\n\nIf the concentration\nof a radionuclide listed in Table 1 exceed 0.1 times the value listed in Table\n1 but does not exceed the value in Table 1, the waste will be Class C, provided\nthe concentration of radionuclides listed in Table 2 does not exceed the value\nshown in column 3 of Table 2. (f) Classification of wastes with\nradionuclides other than those listed in Tables 1 and 2. If radioactive waste does not contain any radionuclides\nlisted in either Table 1 or 2, it is Class A. (g) The sum-of-the-fractions rule for\nmixtures of radionuclides. For determining classification for waste that contains a\nmixture of radionuclides, it is necessary to determine the sum of fractions by\ndividing each radionuclide's concentration by the appropriate limit and summing\nthe resulting values. The appropriate limits must all be taken from the same\ncolumn of the same table. The sum of the fractions for the column must be less\nthan 1.0 if the waste class is to be determined by that column. Example: A waste contains Sr-90 in a\nconcentration of 50 Ci/m\n3\nand Cs-137 in a\nconcentration of 22 Ci/m\n3. Since the concentrations both exceed the values in column\n1, Table 2, they must be compared to column 2 values. For Sr-90 fraction, 50/150 = 0.33; For Cs-137 fraction, 22/44 = 0.5. The sum of the fractions = 0.83. Since the sum is less than 1.0, the waste is Class\nB. (h) Determination\nof concentrations in wastes. (1)\n\nThe\nconcentration of a radionuclide may be determined by indirect methods such as\nuse of scaling factors which relate to the inferred concentration of one\nradionuclide to another that is measured, or radionuclide material\naccountability, if it is reasonably ensured that the indirect methods can be\ncorrelated with actual measurements. (2)\n\nThe concentration of a radionuclide may\nbe averaged over the volume of the waste, (or the weight of the waste if the\nconcentration is expressed in units of nanocuries per gram. If the waste form\nis a homogeneous mixture of waste in a solidification agent or matrix, the\nsolidification agent or matrix may be included in the volume or weight of the\nwaste. The concentration of radionuclides in discrete objects (such as sealed\nsources, filters, and metal components containing induced radioactivity) that\nare encapsulated in solidification agent or matrix must be averaged over the\nvolume of the object, not of the solidification agent or matrix. The volume of\npackaging, containers, liners, or overpacks cannot be included in this\ncalculation, nor can the volume of the waste mixture be artificially increased\nby the addition of solids or objects even if they are considered as waste, NARM\nwaste, or solid waste.

Practical consideration such as the effects of external\nradiation and internal heat generation on transportation, handling and disposal\nwill limit the concentrations for these wastes. These wastes shall be Class B\nunless the concentrations of other nuclides in Table 2 determine the waste to\nbe Class C independent of these nuclides.
