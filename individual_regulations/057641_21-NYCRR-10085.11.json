  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 10085.11 - Cross-connection restrictions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\n\nState Sanitary Code establishes safeguards for public water supplies by\npreventing backflow into public water systems. In furtherance of such purpose, these regulations are adopted to: (1)\nprotect\nthe public water supply against actual or potential cross-connections by\nisolating within the premises contamination or pollution that may occur because\nof some undiscovered or unauthorized cross-section on the premises; (2)\neliminate existing connections between\ndrinking water systems and other sources of water that are not approved as safe\nand potable for human consumption; (3)\neliminate cross-sections between drinking\nwater systems and other sources of water or process water used for any purpose\nwhatsoever which jeopardize the safety of the drinking water supply; (4)\nprevent the making of cross-connections\nin the future; and\n(5)\nencourage\nthe exclusive use of public sources of water supply. (b) In the interest of public health, the\nwater board will not permit its mains or services to be connected with any\nservice pipe or piping which is connected with any source of water supply not\napproved by the State Department of Health. In conformance with the State\n\nSanitary Code, the water board has implemented a cross connection control\nprogram and shall not permit its mains or service pipes to be connected in any\nway to any piping, tank, vat or other apparatus which contains liquids, chemicals, contaminants or any other matter which might flow back into the\nwater board's service pipe or mains and consequently endanger the water supply\nwithout the installation of a proper backflow prevention device as specified by\nthe State Department of Health, at a location approved by the commissioner. All\npresent and/or future users who present the potential danger of being in\nviolation of the State Sanitary Code shall install a backflow prevention device\nat their expense, in accordance with the State Department of Health, cross\nconnection control regulations (10 NYCRR section 5-1.31) and as may be amended\nfrom time to time. In the event any provisions of these regulations are\ninconsistent with such State Department of Health regulations, the regulations\nof the State Department of Health shall govern. (c) Protection of public water system at\nservice connection. (1)\n\nWhere protection is\nrequired. (i) Each service connection from a\npublic water system for supplying water to premises having an auxiliary water\nsupply shall be protected against backflow of water from the premises into the\npublic water system. (ii)\n\nEach\nservice connection from a public water system for supplying water to premises\non which any substance is handled under pressure in such fashion as to permit\nentry into the water system shall be protected against backflow of the water\nfrom the premises into the public system. This shall include the handling of\nprocess waters and waters originating from the public water supply system which\nhave been subject to deterioration in sanitary quality. (iii)\n\nEach service connection from a public\nwater system for supplying water to premises on which a substance of unusually\ntoxic concentration or danger to health is handled in liquid form, even though\nit is not under pressure, shall be protected against backflow of water from\npremises into the public water system. Examples are plating factories using\ncyanide and hospitals. (iv)\n\nBackflow-prevention devices shall be installed on the service connection to any\npremises that have actual or potential internal cross-connections. (v) Backflow-prevention devices shall be\ninstalled on the service connection to any premises in which the department is\nnot allowed to fully and completely review all processes within the\nfacility. (2)\n\nIt shall\nbe the responsibility of the user to provide protecting devices as required\nunder subdivision (d) of this section. (d) Type of protection. The protective device\nrequired shall depend on the degree of hazard as tabulated below: (1)\n\nAt the service connection to any premises\non which there is a substance that would be aesthetically objectionable, but\nnot necessarily hazardous to health, the public water supply shall be protected\nby an approved double-check-valve assembly. (2)\n\nAt the service connection to any premises\non which there is an auxiliary water supply meeting the State drinking water\nstandards, the public water supply system shall be protected by an approved\ndouble-check-valve assembly. (3)\n\nAt\nthe service connection to any premises on which there is an auxiliary water\nsupply not meeting the State drinking water standards, the public water supply\nsystem shall be protected by an air-gap separation or an approved\nreduced-pressure principle backflow-preventer device. The air gap shall be\nlocated as close as practicable to the water meter, and all piping between the\nwater meter and the surge tank shall be entirely visible. (4)\n\nAt the service connection to any premises\non which any material dangerous to health or toxic substance in toxic\nconcentration is or may be handled under pressure, the public water supply\nshall be protected by an air-gap separation. The air gap shall be located as\nclose as practicable to the water meter, and all piping between the water meter\nand the surge tank shall be entirely visible. If these conditions cannot\nreasonably be met, the public water supply shall be protected with an approved\nreduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention device, provided that the\nalternative is acceptable to both the department and the Erie County Health\n\nDepartment. (5)\n\nAt the service\nconnection to any premises on which any material dangerous to health or toxic\nsubstance in toxic concentration is or may be handled, but not under pressure, the public water supply shall be protected by an air-gap separation or an\napproved reduced-pressure principle backflow-preventer device. The air gap\nshall be located as close as practicable to the water meter, and all piping\nbetween the water meter and the surge tank shall be entirely visible. (6)\n\nAt the service connection to any sewage\ntreatment plant or sewage pumping station, the public water supply shall be\nprotected by an air-gap separation. The air gap shall be located as close as\npracticable to the water meter, and all piping between the water meter and the\nsurge tank shall be entirely visible. If these conditions cannot be reasonably\nmet, the public water supply shall be protected with an approved\nreduced-pressure principle backflow-prevention device, provided that this\nalternative is acceptable to both the department and the Erie County Health\n\nDepartment. (7)\n\nAt the service\nconnection to any premises where the department is not allowed to fully and\ncompletely review all processes within the building, the public water system\nshall be protected by an air-gap separation or an approved reduced-pressure\nprinciple backflow-prevention device. The air gap shall be located as close as\npracticable to the water meter, and all piping between the water meter and the\nsurge tank shall be entirely visible. (e) Frequency of inspection of protective\ndevices. It shall be the duty of the owner on any premises on account of which\nbackflow-protective devices are installed to have competent inspections made at\nleast once a year, or more often in those instances where successive\ninspections indicate repeated failure. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the expense of the water user whenever they are found\nto be defective. These tests shall be performed by a certified\nbackflow-prevention-device tester, and all test results shall be made available\nto the department and the Erie County Health Department. (f) Notification of violations. The\ncommissioner shall notify the owner or authorized agent of the owner of the\nbuilding or premises in which there is found a violation of this section of the\nregulations. The commissioner shall set a reasonable time for the owner to have\nthe violation removed or corrected. Upon failure of the owner to have the\ndefect corrected by the end of the specified time interval, the commissioner\nmay, if, in his judgment, an imminent health hazard exists, cause the water\nservice to the building or premises to be terminated and/or recommend such\nadditional fines or penalties to be invoked as herein may be\nprovided.
