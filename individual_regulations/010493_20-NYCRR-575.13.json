  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 575.13 - Credit for prior transfer tax paid\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1405-A\n(a) A grantor is allowed a credit against the\ntax due on a conveyance of real property to the extent that tax was paid by the\ngrantor on a prior creation of a leasehold of all or a portion of the same real\nproperty or on the granting of an option or contract to purchase all or a\nportion of the same real property. (b) The credit is computed by multiplying the\ntax paid on the creation of the leasehold or on the granting of an option or\ncontract by a fraction, the numerator of which is the value of the\nconsideration used to compute the tax paid which is not yet due to the grantor\non the date of the subsequent conveyance (and which the grantor will not be\nentitled to receive after such date), and the denominator of which is the total\nvalue of the consideration used to compute the tax paid. Example: A, the owner of real property, leased the property to B for\n$400,000 consideration, which was to be paid to A over the term of the lease. Under the terms of the lease, B was provided an option to purchase the\nproperty. A paid a real estate transfer tax of $1600 based upon the $400,000\nconsideration. Several years later, before the expiration of the lease, B\nexercised the option and purchased the property from A. Up to the date of the\nsale, A had received $300,000 of the total $400,000 consideration. As a result\nof the sale, A was not entitled to receive the remaining $100,000 of\nconsideration. A is entitled to a credit against the transfer tax due on the\nsale of the property computed as follows: $100,000 ÷ $400,000 × $1600 = $400\ncredit\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
