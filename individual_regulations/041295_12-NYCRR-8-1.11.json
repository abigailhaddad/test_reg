Upon receipt of a report certified to\nby the person or firm making such installation that the tests have been made in\naccordance with the requirements of this section, the commissioner may issue a\ncertificate to that effect if the elevator passed such tests\nsatisfactorily. (d) Where the\nhoistway and elevator are constructed under separate contracts, the Industrial\n\nCommissioner will on the request give to each contractor the results of the\ninspection or test of the work done by the contractor.
