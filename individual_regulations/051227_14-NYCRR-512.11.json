  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 512.11 - Medicaid reimbursement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General reimbursement requirements for PROS providers. (1)\n\nReimbursement shall be made only for\nindividuals who: (i) are in pre-admission\nstatus pursuant to section\n512.7\n(c)(4)\nof\nthis Part; (ii)\nare registered in a\nPROS program pursuant to section\n512.7\n(c)(13)\nof\nthis Part; or\n(iii)\nare collaterals\nof persons who are registered in a PROS program, or are in pre-admission\nstatus. (2)\n\nUnless an\nindividual is registered with a PROS program pursuant to section\n512.7\n(c) of this\n\nPart, reimbursement is limited to the pre-admission monthly base rate, consistent with section\n512.12\n(e) of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nFor purposes of\nreimbursement for individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care, a PROS program\nis considered to be a carved-out service. (4)\n\nWhen available and appropriate, PROS\nproviders shall maximize the use of funding from the Office of Vocational and\n\nEducational Services for Individuals with Disabilities (VESID). Time spent in\nsuch funded activities shall not be included in the duration of program\nparticipation pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section. (5)\n\nIn order to be eligible for\nreimbursement, any PROS service provided to a PROS participant in the\nparticipant's employment setting and any ORS service shall be on a one-to-one\nbasis. (b) Reimbursement\nfor comprehensive PROS programs. (1)\nA\ncomprehensive PROS program shall be reimbursed on a monthly case payment\nbasis. (2)\n\nThe reimbursement\nstructure for a comprehensive PROS program consists of the following four\nelements: (i) monthly base rate; (ii)\nIR component add-on; (iii)\nORS component add-on; and\n(iv)\nclinical treatment component\nadd-on. (3)\n\nThe basic\nmeasure for the PROS monthly base rate is the PROS unit. PROS units are\naccumulated during the course of each day that the individual participates in\nthe PROS program, and are aggregated up to a monthly total to determine the\namount of the PROS monthly base rate that can be billed for the individual\nduring a particular month. (4)\n\nThe\nPROS unit is determined by the duration of program participation, which\nincludes a combination of on-site and off-site program participation and\nservice frequency as defined in section\n512.4\nof this Part. (5)\n\nProgram participation is measured and\naccumulated in 15 minute increments. Increments of less than 15 minutes must be\nrounded down to the nearest quarter hour to determine the program participation\nfor the day. (6)\n\nMedically\nnecessary PROS services include: (i) assessment services; (ii)\ncrisis\nintervention services; (iii)\nengagement services; (iv)\nindividualized recovery planning services; (v) pre-admission screening services provided\nduring pre-admission status and documented in a pre-admission screening\nnote; (vi)\nservices delineated in\nthe screening and admission note pursuant to section\n512.7\n(c)(7)\nof\nthis Part, which are provided subsequent to the individual's admission date, but prior to the completion of the initial IRP, and documented in the progress\nnote; and\n(vii)\nservices identified\nin, and provided in accordance with, the individual's IRP. (7)\n\nIf a recipient employee provides a\nmedically necessary service to other participants in the PROS program, such\nservice may be included in the calculation of PROS units for such participants, as applicable. However, such service may not be included in the calculation of\nPROS units for the recipient employee. (8)\n\nIn order to accumulate any PROS units for\na day, a PROS program must deliver a minimum of one medically necessary PROS\nservice to an individual or collateral during the course of the day. (9)\nPROS units are accumulated in intervals\nof 0.25. The maximum number of PROS units per individual per day is\nfive. (10)\n\nThe formula for\naccumulating PROS units during a program day is as follows: (i) If one medically necessary PROS service\nis delivered, the number of PROS units is equal to the duration of program\nparticipation, rounded down to the nearest quarter hour, or two units, whichever is less. (ii)\n\nIf two\nmedically necessary PROS services are delivered, the number of PROS units is\nequal to the duration of program participation, rounded down to the nearest\nquarter hour, or four units, whichever is less. (iii)\n\nIf three or more medically necessary\nPROS services are delivered, the number of PROS units is equal to the duration\nof program participation, rounded down to the nearest quarter hour, or five\nunits, whichever is less. (11)\n\nTo satisfy the service frequency\nrequirement of this Part, services must be provided in accordance with the\nfollowing: (i) services provided in a group\nformat shall be at least 30 minutes in duration; and\n(ii)\nservices provided in an individual\nmodality shall be at least 15 minutes in duration. (12)\n\nWhen a medically necessary CRS service\nis provided in a group format, such service shall not be used to satisfy the\nservice frequency requirement of this Part for more than 12 members of the\ngroup per each participating staff member. (13)\n\nTo determine the monthly base rate, the\ndaily PROS units accumulated during the calendar month are aggregated and\ntranslated into one of five payment levels, in accordance with section\n512.12\n(e) of this\n\nPart. (14)\nA minimum of two PROS\nunits must be accrued for an individual during a calendar month in order to\nbill the monthly base rate. (c) Reimbursement for component add-ons in\ncomprehensive PROS programs. (1)\n\nThe three\ncomponent add-ons pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) of this section are provided in\nrecognition that certain activities involve increased costs due to their\nintensity or the need for specialized staff expertise. (i) Up to two component add-ons may be billed\nper individual per month. (ii)\n\nIn\nno event shall an ORS component add-on and an IR component add-on be billed in\nthe same month for the same individual. (iii)\n\nComponent add-ons shall not be billed\nprior to the calendar month in which the individual is registered with the PROS\nprogram. (2)\n\nIntensive\nrehabilitation. (i) In order to bill the IR\ncomponent add-on, an individual must have received at least six PROS units\nduring the month, including at least one IR service, as identified in section\n512.7\n(b)(4)\nof\nthis Part. (ii)\n\nWhen a medically\nnecessary IR service, other than family psychoeducation/intensive family\nsupport, is provided in a group format, such service shall not be used to\nsatisfy the service frequency requirement of this Part, or the IR service\nrequirement of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, for more than eight members\nof the group. (iii)\n\nWhen a\nmedically necessary family psychoeducation/intensive family support IR service\nis provided in a group format, such service shall not be used to satisfy the\nservice frequency requirement of this Part, or the IR service requirement of\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, for more than 16 members of the\ngroup. (iv)\n\nMedicaid may reimburse\nthe IR component add-on for up to 50 percent of a provider's total number of\nmonthly base rate bills submitted annually. (v) In instances where a comprehensive PROS\nprogram provides IR services to an individual, but CRS services are provided by\nanother provider of service or no CRS services are provided in the month, the\ncomprehensive PROS provider shall submit an IR-only bill. When an IR-only bill\nis submitted, the minimum six PROS units required pursuant to subparagraph (i)\nof this paragraph shall be limited to the provision of IR services. (3)\n\nOngoing rehabilitation and\nsupport. (i) PROS programs may only bill the\nORS component add-on for individuals who work in an integrated competitive job\nfor a minimum of 10 hours per week. However, to allow for periodic absences due\nto illness, vacations, or temporary work stoppages, individuals who are\nscheduled to work at least 10 hours per week and have worked at least one week\nwithin the month for 10 hours qualify for reimbursement. (ii)\nA minimum of two face-to-face contacts\nwith the individual and/or identified collateral, which include ongoing\nrehabilitation and support services, must be provided per month. A minimum\ncontact is 30 continuous minutes in duration. At least two of the face-to-face\ncontacts must occur on separate days. A contact may be split between the\nindividual and the collateral. At least one visit per month shall be with the\nindividual only. (iii)\n\nIn instances\nwhere a comprehensive PROS program provides ORS services to an individual, but\nCRS services are provided by another provider of service or no CRS services are\nprovided in the month, the comprehensive PROS provider shall submit an ORS-only\nbill. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(15) of this section, the minimum service\nrequirement for submission of an ORS-only bill shall be consistent with\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (4)\n\nClinical treatment. (i) In order to bill the clinical treatment\nadd-on, a minimum of one clinical treatment service, as identified in section\n512.7\n(b)(9)\nof\nthis Part, must be provided during the month. (ii)\n\nIndividuals receiving clinical treatment\nmust have, at a minimum, one face-to-face contact with a psychiatrist or nurse\npractitioner in psychiatry every three months, or more frequently as clinically\nappropriate. Such contact during any of the first three calendar months of the\nindividual's admission will enable billing for the month of contact, any\npreceding months in which the client has been registered with the PROS program, and the two months following the month of contact. Thereafter, each month that\ncontains a contact with a psychiatrist or nurse practitioner in psychiatry will\nenable billing for that month and the next two months. (iii)\n\nThe clinical treatment component may\nonly be reimbursed in conjunction with the monthly base rate and/or the\nintensive rehabilitation or ongoing rehabilitation and support\nadd-on. (iv)\n\nIf it is clinically\nappropriate to deliver a clinical treatment service in a group format, the\ngroup size limitations for CRS services in sections\n512.7\n(b)(3)\nand\n512.11\n(b)(13)\nof\nthis Part shall apply. (d) Reimbursement for limited license PROS\nprograms. (1)\nA limited license PROS program\nshall be reimbursed on a monthly case payment basis.

(e) Reimbursement for pre-admission program participation. (1)\n\nReimbursement for individuals who are in\ncontinuous pre-admission status is limited to two consecutive months, whether\nor not the individual is ultimately admitted to the program. (i) If pre-admission program participation\noccurs in the month preceding the month of admission, reimbursement cannot\nexceed the pre-admission monthly base rate pursuant to section\n512.12\n(e) of this\n\nPart.
