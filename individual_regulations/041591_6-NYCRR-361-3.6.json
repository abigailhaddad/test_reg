  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 361-3.6 - Other organics recycling facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Exempt facilities. The following facilities are exempt from this Subpart\nwhen operated in a manner that does not produce vectors, dust or odors that\nunreasonably impact neighbors of the facility, as determined by the department. A product generated must be used in a beneficial manner that is protective of\nhuman health and the environment. (1)\nA facility located at a site controlled by the waste generator, in accordance\nwith paragraph 360.14(b)(1) of this Title. (2)\nA facility that accepts only animal\nmanure and bedding. (3)\nA facility\nthat accepts no more than 1,000 pounds or one cubic yard, whichever is greater, of SSO per week based on a monthly average. (4)\nA facility covered by a CAFO permit\nprovided that the waste accepted is limited to manure, food processing waste, FOG, and non-industrial organic wastes without sanitary content. The non-manure\nwaste received must not exceed 50 percent, by volume, of waste managed on an\nannual basis. Facilities that are not owned by the farm must be covered by the\nfarm's CAFO approvals. (b) Registered facilities. Facilities of the following types are subject to the\nregistration provision of section\n360.15\nof this Title unless\notherwise exempt. Each facility must comply with the criteria in section\n360.19\nof this Title and the\noperational criteria in subdivision (c) of this section. (1)\nA facility that accepts less than ten\ntons of SSO per day. The waste must not contain sanitary content. Incoming\nwaste must be stored in a vessel or other enclosed device and odors must be\ncontrolled. Incoming industrial waste must be acceptable to the\ndepartment. (c) Operating criteria for registered facilities. A registered facility must be\noperated in compliance with section\n360.19\nof this Title and the\nfollowing conditions: (1)\n\nMaterial accepted\ncan not remain at the facility for more than 24 months. (2)\n\nThe facility must be constructed to\nminimize any ponding, and run-off must be effectively controlled. (3)\n\nThe facility must be at least 200 feet\nfrom the nearest surface water body, potable water well and state-regulated\nwetland. (4)\nSSO accepted must be\nstored in a vessel or in an enclosed area. (5)\n\nThe facility must be at least 200 feet\nfrom the nearest residence or place of business. This exclusion does not apply\nto the waste generating business or the operator's residence, or any residence\nor place of business built after the facility began operation. The buffer area\ncan be reduced by the department if means (such as enclosed vessels, etc.)\nacceptable to the department are used to reduce the potential for odor\ntransmission. (6)\n\nThe facility must\nkeep written records of all materials entering and leaving the facility and the\ncorresponding dates. (7)\n\nAll waste\nreceived must be source-separated. Material received in its original packaging\n(for example, off-spec drinks) that will be depackaged prior to processing are\nallowed. (8)\n\nThe product must be\nused in a manner that does not cause negative animal health or environmental\nimpacts. If used as a soil conditioner, agronomic rates must be followed. (9)\n\nThe facility must not produce\nodors that unreasonably impact sensitive receptors, as determined by the\ndepartment. The department can require a reduction in the amount of waste\naccepted, or other actions, to address odor issues.

(4)\n\nMonitoring requirements. (i) For facilities that accept biosolids, septage, or other sludges, each waste source must not exceed the pollutant\nconcentrations found in Table 6 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart, unless the\nwaste source is a minor (less than 10 percent of the total dry weight of\nsludges accepted) component of the input to the facility and a program is\ndeveloped to identify and reduce the pollutant(s) that exceed the limits for\nthat waste source. This requirement does not apply to product that will be used\noutside New York State. (a) If a waste input, other than a minor source, contains metals at concentrations greater than those\nset forth in Table 6 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart, the waste\ncannot be accepted at the facility until the generator has implemented a\npollutant identification and abatement program and compliance with the\nrequirements of this paragraph has been demonstrated for waste representing a\nperiod of at least six continuous months. At least six analyses for total\nsolids and the parameter of concern must be provided to demonstrate compliance. This requirement does not apply to products used outside New York\n\nState. (b) Wastewater and partially\ntreated biosolids that are generated at one wastewater treatment facility and\nare further treated at another wastewater treatment facility before digestion\nare not considered waste sources subject to the criteria in this paragraph. The\nresultant biosolids or sludge generated for digestion are subject to this\nparagraph. (ii)\n\nAny\nmaterial added to the process must not contain pollutants in concentrations\nthat exceed the levels found in Table 6 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart. (iii)\n\nAnalysis of the product is required for\nthe parameters in Table 1 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart. The\nfrequency of sampling is specified in Tables 4 and 5 of section 360-3.9 of this\n\nSubpart. All samples must be representative of the product that will be\ndistributed. With the exception of pH and total solids, all results must be\nreported on a dry weight basis. Copies of the original laboratory results must\nbe included. (a) Each sample must be a\ncomposite of at least five grab samples. (b) After the product has been monitored for\ntwo years at the frequency outlined in this paragraph, the department can\nreduce the annual number of analyses required if the product quality\nconsistently meets the product quality standards in Table 6 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart. (c) For product derived from non-sanitary\nwaste, the required analyses can be reduced depending on the use of the\nmaterial, as determined by the department. (iv)\n\nSufficient monitoring data must be\nobtained to demonstrate compliance with the pathogen and vector attraction\nreduction requirements, if applicable. The frequency and type of monitoring\nnecessary, based on the methods employed to achieve pathogen and vector\nattraction reduction, must be approved by the department. At a minimum, temperature monitoring must occur daily in the coldest part of the waste\nmass. (v) The department can\nrequire analysis of the product for maturity before distribution. This can\ninclude, but is not limited to, organic matter reduction, plant growth impact, or oxygen consumption. (vi)\n\nEach\nbiosolids, septage, and sludge source must be analyzed in accordance with the\nfollowing: (a) The required parameters for\nanalysis are found in Table 1 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart. (b) The minimum number of analyses required\ndepends on the quantity of waste digested, as outlined in Table 3 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart. (c) With the exception of pH and total\nsolids, all results must be reported on a dry weight basis. After the waste has\nbeen monitored for two years at the frequency outlined in this paragraph, the\ndepartment can reduce the annual number of analyses required if the waste\nquality consistently meets the quality standards. (d) Wastewater and partially treated\nbiosolids or septage that are generated at one wastewater treatment facility\nand treated at another wastewater treatment facility before beneficial use are\nnot considered waste sources subject to the criteria in this paragraph. The\nresultant biosolids or sludge generated for beneficial use are subject to this\nparagraph. (vii)\n\nFor\nother wastes, analyses of the input waste can be required, as determined by the\ndepartment, based on the characteristics of the waste. The extent and frequency\nof sampling will be determined by the department on a case-specific\nbasis. (5)\n\nReporting\nrequirements\n(i) The annual report required\nby paragraph 360.19(k)(3) of this Title must include: (a) all information and analyses, including\ncopies of the laboratory sheets, required by this Subpart; (b) the type and quantity of the waste\nprocessed, including the source of the material; (c) process operational information including\nmonitoring data and significant facility operational problems and any actions\ntaken to correct problems; (d) the\nquantity, by weight and volume, of product generated at the facility and the\nquantity of material removed from the facility; and\n(e) a description of the use of the\nproduct.
