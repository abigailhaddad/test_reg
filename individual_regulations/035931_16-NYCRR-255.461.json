  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.461 - External corrosion control: protective coating\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each external protective coating, whether\nconductive or insulating, applied for the purpose of external corrosion control\nmust: (1)\nbe applied on a properly prepared\nsurface; (2)\nhave sufficient\nadhesion to the metal surface to effectively resist underfilm migration of\nmoisture; (3)\nbe sufficiently\nductile to resist cracking; (4)\nhave sufficient strength to resist damage due to handling and soil stress; and\n(5)\nhave properties compatible\nwith any supplemental cathodic protection. (b) Each external protective coating which is\nan electrically insulating type must also have low moisture absorption and high\nelectrical resistance. (c) Each\nexternal protective coating must be inspected just prior to lowering the pipe\ninto the ditch and backfilling, and any damage detrimental to effective\ncorrosion control must be repaired. (d) Electrical tests appropriate for the type\nof coating shall be used on pipelines to operate at 125 psig (862 kPa) or more\nto detect defects in the coating which may not be revealed by a visual\ninspection. Where such tests are not practical, electrical tests, after\ninstallation, shall be conducted. (e) Electrical tests of pipe coating on\ndistribution mains, other than those covered by subdivision (d) of this\nsection, shall be conducted where practical. (f) Each external protective coating must be\nprotected from damage resulting from adverse ditch conditions or damage from\nsupporting blocks. (g) If coated\npipe is installed by boring, driving or other similar method, precautions must\nbe taken to minimize damage to the coating during installation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.461\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
