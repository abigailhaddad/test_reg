  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-4.5 - Use of Tables III and IV\nState Regulations\n\nThe use of Tables III and IV shall be subject to the\nfollowing requirements: (a) The sizes\nof members shown in Tables III and IV are the minimum requirements for timber\nbracing systems used in the sheeting and shoring of excavations. (b) Steel, aluminum or combinations of steel, aluminum and timber bracing systems of equivalent strength and capacity may be\nused in place of timber bracing systems. (c) Portable, adjustable-type metal shores\nfor trench bracing systems shall be approved. (d) Braces shall be so placed that the full\ncross-sectional areas required by Tables III and IV of this Subpart bear\nagainst the stringers. (e) Stringers shall be placed with their least dimensions flat against the\nsheeting. (f) Where any side of an\nexcavation is a combination of an unbraced slope in accordance with Table I of\nthis Subpart near the surface and a braced vertical section near the bottom, the sizes of the bracing members shall be determined from Tables III and IV of\nthis Subpart. In such case, the excavation depth shall be the sum of the depth\nof the braced section plus one-half the depth of the unbraced sloped\nsection. (g) The uppermost brace of\nany bracing system shall be located not more than two feet below the top of the\nsupported material. (h) The maximum\ndistance between the lowest brace and the bottom of the excavation shall not\nexceed three feet, except where the sheeting or soldier beam is embedded as\nstipulated in subdivision (i) below.

For any trench over 20 feet in depth\nthe sheeting, shoring and bracing system shall be designed by a professional\nengineer licensed to practice in the State of New York. Such design plan, including design analysis and specifications, shall be submitted to the board\nfor special approval before any work is performed on such excavation. * Sizes of timber for such conditions become excessive. A\nspecial structure designed by a professional engineer licensed to practice in\nthe State of New York shall be constructed and used for the specific condition\ninvolved. Note: Timber sizes are nominal or trade\ndimensions. (i) If the\nbottom of the sheeting or soldier beam is embedded below the bottom of the\nexcavation, the maximum distance between the lowest brace and the bottom of the\nexcavation shall not exceed the vertical spacing for braces allowed in Tables\nIII and IV of this Subpart. The minimum depth of embedment of the sheeting or\nsoldier beam shall be three feet. The actual depth of each such embedment shall\nbe such that there is no significant movement of the bottom of the sheeting or\nsoldier beam. Exception: Where the operation being performed, such as laying large\ndiameter concrete pipe or reinforced concrete culverts, precludes the placing\nof vertical bracing as specified in subdivisions (h) and (i) above, the\nvertical spacing may be in accordance with a specific design and plans made by\na professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of New York. Such\nspecified bracing system shall be designed so that the sheeting and shoring\nwill withstand all the forces intended to be imposed thereon. Copies of the\ndesign and plans of such sheeting and shoring system shall be kept at the job\nsite available for examination by the commissioner. (j) The bracing or shoring of trenches shall\nbe continued as the excavation progresses in length. No person except workmen\nfabricating the required sheeting and shoring system shall be allowed inside\nsuch excavation until the required sheeting and shoring system has been\ncompleted. (k) Backfilling and\nremoval of trench supports shall progress together from the bottom of the\ntrench. Jacks or braces shall be released slowly and, in unstable soil, ropes\nshall be used to remove the jacks or braces from above after employees have\nvacated the trench.
