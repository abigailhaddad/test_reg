Tit. 9 § 8.92 - Executive Order No. 92: Declaring a Disaster in the Counties of Bronx, Dutchess, Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Putnam, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester and Contiguous Areas\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, on February 8, 2013 and continuing thereafter, a\nsevere winter storm is forecast to impact New York State, which poses an\nimminent danger to vital public transportation, utility service, public health, and public safety systems within the counties of Bronx, Dutchess, Kings, Nassau, New York, Orange, Putnam, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester and contiguous areas; and\nWHEREAS, this blizzard is predicted to produce snowfall\namounts in excess of one to two feet, winds in excess of 50 miles per hour, and\ncoastal tidal surges greater than three feet. These conditions may cause\nwidespread power outages and flooding, damage to homes, apartments, businesses, public and private property, damage and uproot trees, and result in moderate to\nsevere coastal erosion, and will continue to pose a threat to public health and\nsafety; NOW, THEREFORE, I, ANDREW M. CUOMO, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nthe Laws of the State of New York, do hereby find that a disaster has occurred\nfor which the affected local governments are unable to respond adequately. Therefore, pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution of the\n\nState of New York and Section 28 of Article 2-B of the Executive Law, I hereby\ndeclare a State Disaster Emergency effective February 8, 2013 within the\nterritorial boundaries of the counties of Bronx, Dutchess, Kings, Nassau, New\n\nYork, Orange, Putnam, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester and\ncontiguous areas; and\nFURTHER, pursuant to Section 29 of Article 2-B of the\n\nExecutive Law, I direct the implementation of the State Comprehensive Emergency\n\nManagement Plan and authorize, effective February 8, 2013, the State Office of\n\nEmergency Management, the Department of Health, the Department of\n\nTransportation, the State Police, the Division of Military and Naval Affairs, the Department of Environmental Conservation, the State Department of\n\nCorrections and Community Supervision, the Public Service Commission, the\n\nOffice of Fire Prevention and Control, the Department of Labor, the Office of\n\nParks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, the Office of General Services, the State University of New York, the Thruway Authority, the Division of\n\nHomeland Security and Emergency Services, other State agencies, and the\n\nAmerican Red Cross, as necessary, to take appropriate action to protect State\nproperty and to assist affected local governments and individuals in responding\nto and recovering from this disaster, and to provide such other assistance as\nnecessary to protect the public health and safety. IN ADDITION, this declaration satisfies the requirements of\n49 C.F.R. §\n390.23(a)(1)(A), which\nprovides relief from Parts 390 through 399 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety\n\nRegulations (FMCSR). Such relief from the FMCSR is necessary in order to ensure\nthat snow removal crews can clear vital roadways, and hasten the movement of\nutility power restoration crews into New York State. FURTHER, I have designated Gregory T. Brunelle, Director of\nthe State Office of Emergency Management, as the State Coordinating Officer for\nthis event. Signed: Andrew M. Cuomo\n\nDated: February 8, 2013\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n8.92\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
