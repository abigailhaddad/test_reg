  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.745 - Valve maintenance: transmission lines\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each transmission line valve must be\ninspected and partially operated at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at\nleast once each calendar year. (b) Each operator must take prompt remedial action to correct any valve found\ninoperable. (c) The location of all\nvalves in transmission lines shall be designated on appropriate records, drawings or maps in relation to aboveground structures, so that the valves and\nassociated access covers can be readily located when the ground is covered with\nsnow and ice. Since there may be changes or alterations in aboveground\nstructures over a period of time, the accuracy of the reference points\nestablished shall be verified at the time of the periodic inspection. (d) At the time of the periodic inspection, valves will be checked for external leakage. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.745\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
