  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.167 - Compressor stations: emergency shutdown\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept for unattended field compressor stations of 1,000\nhorsepower (746 kilowatts) or less, each compressor station must have an\nemergency shutdown system that meets the following: (a) It must be able to block gas out of the\nstation and blow down the station piping. (b) It must discharge gas from the blow down\npiping at a location where the gas will not create a hazard. (c) It must provide means for extinguishing\ngas fires and for the shutdown of gas compressing equipment, and electrical\nfacilities in the vicinity of gas headers and in the compressor building, except that electrical circuits that supply emergency lighting required to\nassist station personnel in evacuating the compressor building and the area in\nthe vicinity of the gas headers must remain energized and electrical circuits\nneeded to protect equipment from damage may remain energized. (d) It must be operable from at least two\nlocations, each of which is: (1)\noutside the\ngas area of the station; (2)\nnear\nthe exit gates, if the station is fenced, or near emergency exits, if not\nfenced; and\n(3)\nnot more than 500\nfeet (152.4 meters) from the limits of the station. (e) If a compressor station supplies gas\ndirectly to a distribution system with no other adequate sources of gas\navailable, the emergency shutdown system must be designed so that it will not\nfunction at the wrong time and cause an unintended outage on the distribution\nsystem. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.167\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
