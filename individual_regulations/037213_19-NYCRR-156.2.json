(5)\n\nKey word means a word other than an\narticle of speech, preposition, conjunction, or an entity indicator. (b) General matters. (1)\n\nTypography. A name may consist of only\nletters of the English alphabet, Arabic and Roman numerals, and symbols capable\nof being reproduced on a standard English language keyboard. (2)\n\nSpecial characters and punctuation. (i) The following special characters will be\nallowed in the name, however they will not, by themselves, make a name\ndistinguishable: ampersand (&), asterisk (*), backslash (\\), left brace (), right brace (OE), greater than sign (>), and less than sign\n(<). (ii)\n\nThe following special\ncharacters will be allowed in the name and will, by themselves, make a name\ndistinguishable: at sign (@), dollar sign ($), equal to sign (=), percentage\nsign (%), plus sign (k), number sign (#), and cent sign (¢).

(3)\n\nTerms indicating form. A name shall\ncontain no more than one entity indicator. An entity indicator of one form\nshall not be used as part of the name of an entity of a different form. An\nentity indicator shall not be used as part of an assumed name. (4)\n\nEvery initial certificate and every\ncertificate amending the name of an entity shall include an English translation\nof the entity's name if the name contains a word or words in a language other\nthan English. (c) Distinguishable names. In order to be accepted for filing, a proposed name of a\ndomestic corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership or\nforeign corporation, limited liability company or limited partnership must be\ndistinguishable from the name of any existing entity and from any reserved name\non the records of the Secretary of State. A name is distinguishable if: (1)\neach name contains one or more different\nletters or numerals, or has a different sequence of letters or numerals, except\nthat adding or deleting the letter \"s\" to make a word plural, singular, or\npossessive shall not make a name distinguishable; or\n(2)\none of the key words is different; or\n(3)\nthe key words are the same, but they are in a different order; or\n(4)\nthe key word or words are the same, but\nthe spelling of at least one key word is different. (d) Indistinguishable names. A proposed name\nis not distinguishable from the name of any other existing entity or from a\nreserved name if the only difference between them is one or more of the\nfollowing: (1)\ndifferences in punctuation or\nhyphenation, use of plural or possessive form of the same word, differences in\ntense, including present versus past tense, or the addition or omission of\nspaces between words or letters; (2)\nas determined by the Department of State, the addition or omission of any article of speech, preposition or conjunction\nor use of a contraction of words in the name of the existing entity or reserved\nname; (3)\nas determined by the\n\nDepartment of State, use of the commonly used abbreviation of a word in one\nname and the spelling out of a word in another name; (4)\nthe use of special characters instead of\nspelling out the names of special characters or what they stand for, or vice\nversa, as determined by the Department of State. The use of the special\ncharacter shall be considered the equivalent of the spelling of the name of the\nspecial character; (5)\naddition or\nexclusion of special characters other than those listed in subparagraph\n(b)(2)(ii) of this section; (6)\nthe\nexpression of a number or numbers using letters instead of Arabic\nnumerals; (7)\nthe inclusion or\nexclusion of an entity indicator (e.g., \"corporation,\" \"limited liability\ncompany,\" etc.) or any abbreviation thereof; (8)\naddition or omission of the word or\nabbreviations of \"company\" or \"companies\"; (9)\ndeviations from or derivatives of the\nsame key word, as determined by the department; (10)\ndifferences between upper and lower case\nletters, typeface or font. (e) The filing of a name does not grant\nrights or interests in that name. The Department of State's role is\nministerial. The Secretary of State does not have the power to determine or\nsettle competing claims to a name under other statutes or under common\nlaw. (f) The methodology used by\nthe Department of State to ascertain whether a proposed name is acceptable will\nnot insure that in all instances a name which is unacceptable is rejected. It\nis the responsibility of the entity to determine to its satisfaction that the\nproposed name is in compliance with all applicable laws and rules. When a name\nwhich has been accepted for filing is later found to be unacceptable, the\n\nDepartment of State will notify the entity that it is required to amend the\nfiled document in order to comply with all applicable statutory and regulatory\nprovisions. Upon the failure of the entity to amend the filed document within\n30 days of such notification, its authority to carry on, conduct or transact\nbusiness or conduct activities in this State shall be suspended by the\n\nDepartment of State. If, at any time following the suspension of an entity's\nauthority to carry on, conduct or transact business or conduct activities in\nthis State, pursuant to this subdivision, such entity shall amend its filed\ndocument so as to comply with all applicable statutory and regulatory\nprovisions, or if the Department of State shall determine that the filed name\nis acceptable, the suspension shall be annulled and the entity's authority to\ncarry on, conduct or transact business or conduct activities in this State\nshall be restored and continue as if no suspension had occurred. (g) The conditions set forth in these\nregulations are not exclusive, and the Secretary of State may exercise\ndiscretion in determining whether a proposed name is distinguishable from the\nreal or fictitious name of an existing domestic or foreign authorized\norganization or a reserved name.
