  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 78.8 - Compliance with aircraft airport noise limits abatement procedures required\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept in an emergency as defined in subdivision (h) of\nthis section, no aircraft shall be operated on the surface of any part of the\nairport, or take off from the airport, except as provided in subdivisions (a)\nto (i) of this section, unless specifically exempted by prior permission of the\nairport operator for an unusual situation, or are public aircraft owned and\noperated by the United States, the states and political subdivisions of the\nstates, aircraft owned and operated by the Armed Forces of the United States, and aircraft operated in support of military operations. (a) Preferential runway use program. Consistent with the responsibility of the pilot in command to assure the safe\noperation of the aircraft, aircraft operators shall adhere to the procedures\npromulgated by the airport traffic control tower regarding the preferential\nrunway use program at the airport. Such procedures currently in effect are\npublished in Tower Letter To Airmen 91- 1which follows. In keeping with the\nsupremacy of Federal law, directions given by the airport traffic control tower\nand revisions to such procedures, as may be published from time to time by the\nFAA, shall supersede procedures contained here; provided that enforcement of\nthe inflight aspect of the Tower Letter shall not be within the province of the\nairport operator. DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION\nFEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION\nREPUBLIC AIRPORT TRAFFIC CONTROL TOWER\nEAST FARMINGDALE, NEW YORK 11735-1584\nISSUED: March 1, 1991 EFFECTIVE: April 1, 1991\nREPUBLIC TOWER LETTER TO AIRMEN 91-1\nINFORMAL RUNWAY USE PROGRAM AND RECOMMENDED GOOD OPERATING\nFLIGHT PROCEDURES\nCANCELLATION DATE: April 1, 1993\n\nThis Letter cancels Republic Tower Letter to Airmen\n89-1. I. PURPOSE. This letter describes the informal runway use program for\n\nRepublic Airport, and recommended good operating flight procedures to be used\nin compliance with local noise abatement procedures. The arrivals and\ndepartures depicted in Attachments 1, 2 and 3 may be superseded by air traffic\ncontrol instructions when necessary. It is not intended that any of the\nprocedures contained therein shall in any way abrogate the authority of the\npilot-in-command to assure the safe operation of the aircraft. Should the\noperator of any aircraft prefer to use a runway other than specified, they are\nexpected to advise accordingly. II. PROCEDURES\nA. Priority of Runway Use. 1. Departures -- Runway 1\n\nArrivals -- Runway 32\n2. Departures -- Runway 14 and Runway 19\n\nArrivals -- Runway 19\n3. Any other runway or combination of\nrunways. B. Operational\n\nSafety Criteria for Priority of Runway Use. The priority listed in Paragraph II.A. shall not be used if\nany of the following conditions exist: 1. Crosswind component: Arrivals -- exceeds 10 knots with a dry runway. Departures -- exceeds the following crosswind component\ncriteria with a dry runway: Single Engine 10 knots\n\nMulti-Engine Piston Driven 15 knots\n\nTurbo-Prop and Turbo-Jet 20 knots\n2. Any tailwind component. 3. Pilot report of wind shear. 4. Thunderstorm activity in the initial\ndeparture path or final approach path (within 5 NM) of the selected\nrunway. 5. For landings, the\nreported visibility is less than one statute mile. 6. Runway braking effectiveness reported less\nthan \"good,\" hydroplaning or unusually slippery surfaces reported. 7. Snow, slush, ice or standing water is\npresent or reported. C. Departure Procedures, VFR. (Attachment #1)\n1. Runway 1 -- After departure, fly runway heading to the Long Island Expressway\nbefore proceeding on course. 2. Runway 14 -- At airport boundary, turn right, parallel Runway 19 departure\npath, track southbound over industrial area until Sunrise Highway or 1,600 feet\nbefore proceeding on course. 3. Runway 19 -- After departure, fly runway heading until Sunrise Highway or 1,600\nfeet before proceeding on course. 4. Runway 32 -- At airport boundary, turn\nright to track over Route 110 northbound until past the Long Island Expressway\nbefore proceeding on course. D. Arrival Procedures, VFR\n1. Runway 1 and 32 (Attachment #2) -- Enter\ndownwind over National Cemetery, two miles northeast of airport. Enter base leg\nover Sunrise Highway. Turn final as appropriate. Runway 32 arrivals are advised\nto enter the traffic pattern from the northeast to avoid the straight-out\ndepartures off Runway 1. 2. Runway\n14 and 19 (Attachment #3) -- Enter downwind over landfill area 1 1/2 miles east\nof airport. E. Departure/Arrival Procedures, IFR. All Runways: Use Standard Instrument Departure procedures\nor departure/arrival procedures specified by air traffic control. F. Flight Procedures\n\nAll VFR aircraft should contact Republic Tower on 118.8 MHz\nwhen approximately 10 miles from the airport. Airport and weather information\nwill normally be available on the Automatic Terminal\n\nInformation System (ATIS) on 126.65 MHz. If ATIS\ninformation is not available, monitor tower frequency, 118.8 MHz for Airport\nand Weather information. In either case, advise the Tower\n\nController on INITIAL CONTACT that you have\n\"Information\n\nIn accordance with FAR 91.87, you MAY NOT enter an\n\nAirport\n\nTraffic Area until two-way radio communications have been\nestablished with the tower and AUTHORIZATION to enter is received. (EXCEPT FOR\nLOST COMMUNICATION PROCEDURES.)\n\nAll transmissions should be clear, concise and brief as\npossible. G. Traffic\n\nPattern Altitude. 1. 1,100 feet for piston\nengine aircraft. 2. 1,600 feet for\nturbine engine aircraft. H. Operators are asked to avoid the noise\nsensitive area northwest of the airport to the maximum extent practicable. /s/ Anthony C. Darienzo\n\nAir Traffic Manager\n\nRepublic Tower\n\nImage\n\nImage\n\nImage\n(b) Additional\nrestrictions on night time operations. No aircraft shall takeoff or land on\nrunway 14-32 between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. the subsequent day, local time, except under the following conditions: (1)\n\nThe use of runway 14-32 is required by\nactual instrument weather conditions or crosswinds in excess of those specified\nin Republic Tower Letter To Airmen 91-1 above. (2)\n\nRunway 1-19 is unavailable for\nuse. (c) Noise abatement\nprocedures for turbojet business aircraft. The Noise Abatement Procedures for\n\nTurbojet Business Aircraft established by the National Business Aircraft\n\nAssociation are recommended for operators of jet aircraft, except where\nsuperseded by other rules contained herein. (d) Intersection takeoffs. No aircraft\noperator shall takeoff from a taxiway intersection with a runway, except for\nthose intersections designated A1, A5, B1, B6, G1, G4, and G5 when required and\ncleared for such an intersection takeoff by the airport traffic control tower. During such times that the airport traffic control tower is closed, only full\nlength takeoffs shall be made. (e) Compliance with FAA noise rules, regulations, orders and procedures. All\naircraft operations shall be in compliance with all applicable FAA rules, regulations, orders and procedures respecting noise, as the same may be amended\nfrom time to time, except as exempted or otherwise authorized by FAA. (f) Aircraft engine operation for maintenance\npurposes. (1)\n\nAircraft engine testing may be\nconducted on the Compass Rose located off taxiway \"A\" between runways 1 and 32\nbetween the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., local time. (2)\n\nNo aircraft engine testing shall be\nconducted on the airport between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. local\ntime. (g) Flight\ntraining. Flight training, including instrument approaches and touch-and-go\nlandings and takeoffs, may be conducted in accordance with all the requirements\nof this section, provided, in the opinion of the airport operator, such flight\ntraining does not interfere with itinerant operations. However, whenever\npracticable, flight training shall be conducted between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., local time. (h) Exemption of emergency conditions. Notwithstanding the provisions of this\nsection, aircraft may utilize the airport under the following circumstances: (1)\n\nAn immediate landing is required due to a\ndeclared aircraft emergency. (2)\nA\ntakeoff or landing is conducted as a part of a medical or life-saving emergency\nprecipitated by the existence of a life-threatening situation. (3)\nA landing is required which results from\nthe use of the Airport as a weather alternate airport when there is not\nsufficient fuel on board or weather conditions do not enable the operator to\nutilize another weather alternate airport. (i) Verification of conditions. Upon request\nof the airport operator, the aircraft operator shall provide verification to\nthe airport operator of the conditions necessitating the exemptions in\nsubdivisions (b) and (h) of this section. (j) Permissible levels of aircraft noise. (1)\n\nPursuant to Federal Aviation\n\nAdministration guidelines, the airport operator prepared Ldn 65 noise contours\nto determine whether such contours encroach into existing residentially\ndeveloped areas. No current encroachment was found. However, future\nencroachment is anticipated unless the following aircraft noise performance\nstandards, measured in accordance with section C36.3 of Appendix C of Federal\n\nAir Regulations Part 36, are imposed in conjunction with other noise abatement\nmeasures. IMPERMISSIBLE LEVELS OF AIRCRAFT NOISE\n80 dBA and above--Takeoff Noise Level\n89 dBA and above--Approach Noise Level\n(2)\n\nSince the Ldn 65 noise contour currently\ndoes not encroach into existing residentially developed areas, the above\naircraft noise performance standards will not be mandatory until after such\nencroachment occurs. The airport operator will continue to monitor noise levels\nat the airport to determine the effectiveness of the noise abatement measures\ncontained in subdivisions (a) through (i) of this section in preventing such\nencroachment. Should the airport operator determine that these noise abatement\nmeasures have not prevented the Ldn 65 noise contour from encroaching into\nexisting residentially developed areas, steps will be taken immediately to\nimpose the above aircraft noise performance standards. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n78.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
