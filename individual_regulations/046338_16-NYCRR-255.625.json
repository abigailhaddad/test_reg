  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.625 - Odorization of gas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All gas\ntransported in transmission lines, and distribution mains operating at 125 PSIG\n(862 kPa) or more, except gas in route to storage fields via a transmission\npipeline line that transported gas without an odorant from that line before May\n5, 1975, is to be adequately odorized in compliance with subdivision\n255.625\n(c) so as\nto render it readily detect- able by the public and employees of the operator\nat all gas concentrations of one fifth of the lower explosive limit and\nabove. (b) All gas transported in\ndistribution mains, except as provided for in subdivision (a) of this section, and service laterals is to be adequately odorized in compliance with\nsubdivision (c) of this section so as to render it readily detectable by the\npublic and employees of the operator at all gas concentrations of one tenth of\nthe lower explosive limit and above. (c) In the concentrations at which it is\nused, the odorant in combustible gases must comply with the following\nrequirements: (1)\n\nThe odorant may not be\ndeleterious to persons, materials or pipe. (2)\n\nThe products of combustion from the\nodorant may not be toxic when breathed nor may they be corrosive or harmful to\nthose materials to which the products of combustion will be exposed. (3)\n\nThe odorant may not be soluble in water\nto an extent greater than 2.5 parts to 100 parts by weight. (d) Odorization equipment must be\ndesigned and maintained so as to ensure the required odorant level in the gas\nunder varying conditions. The equipment must be installed so that it does not\ncause a nuisance to nearby residents by the escape of odorant fumes. (e) Each operator shall establish procedures\nto conduct periodic sampling of combustible gases to assure the proper\nconcentration of odorant in accordance with this section. An appropriate record\nof all odorization practices shall be maintained. (f) Every operator shall maintain records\nsetting forth the types of odorizing equipment and odorants used, the ratios of\nodorant to gas, and the locations of odorization stations. Notes\nN.Y.
