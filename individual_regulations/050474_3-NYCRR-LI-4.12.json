  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.12 - Permissible solicitations with respect to savings bank life insurance\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department received an inquiry as to the legal propriety\nof newspaper, broadcast and direct-mail advertisement of savings bank life\ninsurance. Section 269 of the Banking Law provides that savings banks offering\nlife insurance \"shall not employ solicitors of insurance, and shall not employ\npersons to make house to house collections of premiums\". The department responded that it saw no inherent illegality\nin the use of these techniques. It found that statutory and practical history\nsupported a straightforward reading of the term \"employ solicitors\" as banning\nonly the creation of an employer-employee relationship between the savings bank\nand one whose duties and basis of compensation are substantially those of an\ninsurance salesman collecting commissions directly based on the number and\namount of policies he sells. The statute does not ban the usage of all outside\nmeans of solicitation. The department would, of course, continue to monitor the\nnature, accuracy and cost of such outside means to assure that they remained\nconsistent with the statutory purpose of affording quality protection at a cost\nkept low in large part by the ban discussed herein on commissions and excessive\noverhead. DATED: May 15, 1973\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 4.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
