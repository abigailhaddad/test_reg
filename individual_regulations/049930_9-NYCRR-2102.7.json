  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2102.7 - Order where an apartment is rented to more than one tenant\n\nState Regulations\n(a) On and after February 1, 1952, where an\napartment, in whole or in part, is rented or sought to be rented to more than\none tenant, a landlord shall file an application with the administrator to fix\nmaximum rents for the units or portions of such apartment. Such application\nshall set forth the present maximum rent for the apartment, the furniture, furnishings, facilities, equipment and other services added or proposed to be\nadded, the number of occupants, and the space to be occupied by each tenant in\nsuch apartment, the terms and conditions of occupancy, and all other data which\nmay be required by the administrator. In fixing the maximum rent the\nadministrator shall apportion the previous maximum rent for the entire\napartment among the tenants in proportion to the space they occupy, and shall\nadd thereto the increased rental value of any furniture, furnishings, facilities and equipment added by the landlord. Where the landlord has\nsatisfied all of the requirements of the authorities having jurisdiction over\nthe physical conversion and over the occupancy of the changed housing\naccommodations the administrator, in fixing maximum rents for individual\ntenants, shall also take into consideration all factors bearing on the equities\ninvolved including the cost of any physical conversion or alteration. If there\nwas no previous maximum rent for the entire apartment, the administrator shall\nestablish a maximum rent for the entire apartment based upon the rents\ngenerally prevailing for comparable housing accommodations prior to\napportioning the maximum rent for the entire apartment among the tenants as\nhereinbefore provided. Unless and until an order is issued by the administrator\nfixing maximum rents for the individual tenants of the apartment, the aggregate\nmaximum rent for all of the tenants in the apartment shall be the maximum rent\npreviously established for the apartment. All orders issued under this section\nshall be effective as of the date of first renting. (b) Where no application has been made under\nthis section the administrator at any time upon written request of a tenant, or\non his own initiative, may issue an order pursuant to this section fixing a\nmaximum rent for each of the individual tenants in the apartment effective as\nof the date of such renting. In fixing such maximum rents for the individual\ntenants, the administrator shall use the standards prescribed in subdivision\n(a) of this section. Such order may contain a directive that all rent collected\nby the landlord in excess of the maximum rent established under this\nsubdivision for a period not exceeding two years prior to the date of its\nissuance shall be refunded to the tenant within 30 days after such order shall\nbecome final.
