  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 115.1 - New York itemized deduction of a resident individual\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 615(a) and (b)\n(a) General. (1)\nA resident individual may elect to use\nitemized deductions in computing New York taxable income only if itemized\ndeductions were claimed for the same taxable year on such individual's Federal\nincome tax return. (2)\n\nExcept as\nprovided under section 715(f) of the Tax Law, the New York itemized deduction\nof a resident individual means the total amount of deductions from Federal\nadjusted gross income, other than Federal deductions for personal exemptions, as provided in the laws of the United States for the taxable year, with the\nmodifications required by section\n615 (c) and (d)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (3)\n\nThe New York itemized\ndeduction includes such items as contributions, interest, taxes and medical\nexpenses listed under \"Itemized Deductions\" in the Federal income tax return. It does not include any item deducted in computing the amount of Federal\nadjusted gross income, e.g., business expenses deducted in\ncomputing profit or loss from a business or profession, or depreciation or\nrepairs deducted in computing rental income. (4)\n\nWhere certain Federal itemized deductions\nare subject to annual limitations (\ne.g., medical expenses, contributions, casualty and theft losses and certain miscellaneous expenses), the net amount of such Federal itemized deductions allowed for these items is\ncarried over into the New York itemized deduction without change. (b) Husband and wife. (1)\nA husband or wife may claim the New York\nitemized deduction only if: (i) both claimed\nitemized deductions on their Federal income tax returns for the same year; and\n(ii)\nboth elect to use the New\n\nYork itemized deduction. If either spouse is required to use, or elects to use, the New York standard deduction, the other spouse must also use\nit. (2)\n\nWhere a\nhusband and wife file separate Federal income tax returns for any year, they\nmust also file separate New York State personal income tax returns (see section\n651[b] of the Tax Law), and\nin this case the New York itemized deduction for each spouse is based upon the\nitemized deductions claimed on his or her separate Federal income tax\nreturn. (3)\n\nWhere a husband and\nwife file a joint Federal income tax return using itemized deductions, but are\nrequired to file separate New York State personal income tax returns (see\nsection\n651[b] of the Tax Law), they each may claim only the itemized deductions they would be allowed if their\n\nFederal taxable incomes had been determined separately. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n115.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
