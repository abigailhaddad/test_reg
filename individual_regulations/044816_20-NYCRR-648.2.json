  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 648.2 - Procedure to follow when recording a mortgage for an indefinite amount\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 256\n(a) (1)\n\nWhen a mortgage for an indefinite amount\nis presented for recording, the mortgagee may file with the recording officer a\nsworn statement of the maximum amount secured or which under any contingency\nmay be secured by the mortgage at the date of execution or any time thereafter. Provided, however, that the maximum amount secured or which under any\ncontingency nay be secured by the mortgage at the date of execution or any time\nthereafter as set forth in such statement can in no event be less than that\nportion of such amount secured which is determinable by the terms of the\nmortgage. Such sworn statement may be a separate document or be contained in\nthe mortgage instrument itself. If the sworn statement is filed or a statement\nis contained in the mortgage itself stating such maximum amount, the taxes\ndescribed in Part 642 of this Title shall be based and computed on such maximum\namount. Example 1: A mortgage is presented for recording which provides that\nit shall secure the repayment of a $3 million loan and also it shall stand as\nsecurity for the repayment of further loans which shall be made by the\nmortgagee to the mortgagor. Such mortgage would be considered a mortgage for an\nindefinite amount. The mortgagee chooses to file the statement as to the\nmaximum amount secured by the mortgage. Accordingly, such stated maximum amount\ncannot be less than $3 million. (2)\n\nWhere such sworn statement is filed by\nthe mortgagee, the statement shall thereafter at all times be binding upon and\nconclusive against such owner, the holders of any bonds or obligations secured\nby such mortgage and all persons claiming through the mortgagee any interest in\nthe mortgage or the mortgaged premises. Examples of statements that would have\nthe effect of establishing the maximum amount of principal debt or obligation\nsecured by a mortgage for purposes of measuring the tax imposed pursuant to\nsection\n253\nof\nthe Tax Law are as follows: (i) notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary the maximum amount of\nprincipal indebtedness secured by this mortgage at the time of execution hereof\nor which under any contingency may become secured by this mortgage at any time\nhereafter is $___; or\n(ii)\nnotwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary the maximum amount of\nprincipal indebtedness secured by this mortgage at the time of execution hereof\nor which under any contingency may become secured by this mortgage at any time\nhereafter is $____; plus\n(a) taxes, charges or\nassessments which may be imposed by law upon the premises; (b) premiums on insurance policies covering\nthe premises; (c) expenses incurred\nin upholding the lien of this mortgage, including, but not limited to: (1)\nthe expenses of any litigation to\nprosecute or defend the rights and lien created by this mortgage; (2)\nany amount, cost or charges to which the\nmortgagee becomes subrogated, upon payment, whether under recognized principles\nof law or equity, or under express statutory authority; and\n(3)\ninterest at the default rate (or regular\ninterest rate). (b) (1)\n\nIf\na sworn statement as to the maximum amount secured or which under any\ncontingency may be secured by the mortgagee at the date of execution or any\ntime thereafter, is not filed, the taxes described in Part 642 of this Title\nmust be computed based upon the higher of: (i) the fair market value of the mortgaged\nproperty on the date the mortgage was executed; or\n(ii)\nthe portion of such amount secured which\nis determinable by the terms of the mortgage. (2)\n\nThe fair market value of the property is\ndetermined by the recording officer to whom the mortgage is presented for\nrecording. At the time the mortgage is presented for recording the mortgagor or\nmortgagee must provide to the recording officer such information as the\nrecording officer deems necessary for the purpose of computing such fair market\nvalue of the property covered by the mortgage. The requested information must\ninclude sworn statements of appraisal, made by at least two competent persons\nwho are not a party to the transaction related to the mortgage, which sets\nforth the fair market value of such property as of the date of execution of the\nmortgage. (3)\n\nWhere the appraisals\ndiffer as to the fair market value of the property, the appraisal which sets\nforth the highest fair market value shall be used for purposes of computing the\ntaxes described in Part 642 of this Title. Example 2: Same facts as in example 1 of this section, except that a\nstatement as to the maximum amount secured by the mortgage is not filed by the\nmortgagee when the mortgage is presented for recording and the fair market\nvalue of the property covered by the mortgage is $4 million. The mortgage\nrecording taxes would be imposed and computed upon the higher of the portion of\nthe amount secured which is determinable by the terms of the mortgage, which is\n$3 million, or the fair market value of the property, which is $4 million. Thus, the amount used to compute the taxes would be $4 million. Example 3: Same facts as in example 2, except that the fair market\nvalue of the property is $2 million. Thus, $3 million is used to compute the\nmortgage recording taxes. (4)\n\nThe determination by the recording\nofficer of the value of the property covered by the mortgage and copies of the\nrequested information used as the basis for computing the fair market value of\nthe property and computing the taxes shall be forwarded to and subject to\nreview by the commissioner. (c) A mortgage for an indefinite amount shall\nnot be recorded unless the sworn statement as described at subdivision (a) of\nthis section or the information requested by the recording officer to whom the\nmortgage was presented for recording, as described in subdivision (b) of this\nsection, is filed when the mortgage is presented for recording.
