  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 4255.3 - New York Fund for Innovation in Research and Scientific Talent (NYFIRST) Program\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Authority\nand purpose. The New York State Urban Development Corporation hereby\nestablishes the New York Fund for Innovation in Research and Scientific Talent\n(NYFIRST) Program as a component of the Life Sciences Initiatives Program. NYFIRST is intended to encourage the recruitment and retention of exceptional\nlife science researchers and world-class talent at the state's medical schools\nto accelerate translational research. The recruited or retained researchers\nwill demonstrate proven scientific accomplishments and a history of\nentrepreneurship and grant funding. NYFIRST funds will be used to support the\nestablishment or upgrading of laboratories for these researchers, for purchases\nof capital equipment and specialized supplies needed for their research, and as\nworking capital to cover costs of professional staff (including staff\nscientists, doctoral students/post-doctoral fellows, and technicians, but\nexcluding the recruited researcher) critical to the proposed research. The NYFIRST Program is intended to: (1)\nincrease the number of patent\napplications and patentable discoveries at medical schools and the number of\npatents from these schools; (2)\nincrease the recruitment/retention rate of medical school faculty focused on\ntranslational research; (3)\nenhance\nand expand the expertise, qualifications and capabilities residing within these\ninstitutions; and\n(4)\nincrease\n\nFederal and philanthropic funding, as well as venture capital funding, to\nmedical schools awarded NYFIRST grants. (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the terms below shall have\nthe following meaning: (1)\n\nApplicant\nor\neligible applicant\nshall mean a\nmedical school within the State that applies for NYFIRST assistance.
