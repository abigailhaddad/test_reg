  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6218.4 - Conduct of adjudicatory proceedings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The hearing officer assigned shall set the time at which a hearing shall be\nheld, and shall grant or deny adjournments or continuations thereof. To the\nextent practicable, adjournments shall be scheduled by the hearing officer upon\nconsultation with all participants. Notices of adjournment or continuation\nshall be transmitted directly to the parties by the hearing officer. (b) All adjudicatory proceedings will be\nconducted in accordance with the State Administrative Procedure Act, the\n\nElection Law, rules, regulations and opinions of the State Board and all other\napplicable legal authority. Such law, regulations, opinions and authority\nshall, as relevant, be binding on all determinations and findings of the\nhearing officer. In all instances, due process of law will be observed, including the creation of a transcription of any hearing. (c) A respondent may request the hearing\nofficer to direct the chief enforcement counsel to provide a more definite\nstatement or particularization of an alleged violation in the report of the\nchief enforcement counsel. If the hearing officer determines such request is\nreasonable, the hearing officer shall direct the chief enforcement counsel to\nprovide a more definite statement within a reasonable time frame. (d) The hearing officer shall make findings\nof fact and conclusions of law based on a preponderance of the evidence as to\nwhether a violation has been established and, if so, who is guilty of such\nviolation on notice to and with an opportunity for the individual or entity\naccused of any violations to be heard. However, if the hearing officer finds\nthat on balance, the equities favor a dismissal of the complaint, the hearing\nofficer shall dismiss the charges. In determining whether the equities favor a\ndismissal, the hearing officer shall consider the following factors: (1)\nwhether the complaint alleges a\nde minimis\nviolation(s) of article 14 of the Election\n\nLaw; (2)\nwhether the subject of the\ncomplaint has made a good faith effort to correct the violation; and\n(3)\nwhether the subject of the complaint has\na history of similar violations. For purposes of making any such findings, proceedings before\nthe hearing officer shall be governed by article 3 of the State Administrative\n\nProcedure Act and shall be made on a fair, equitable and uniform basis without\nregard to the status of the individual who is the subject of the report. (e) Any party may\nsubmit proposed findings of fact within time limitations set by the hearing\nofficer. Such findings of fact shall be captioned, titled as such, shall be\nconsecutively numbered and shall be typed legibly on plain, white bond, standard weight paper, 81/2 x 11 inches in size. Such proposed findings of fact\nshall recite basic facts and not evidentiary facts and shall not be conclusions\nof law. A basic fact would be \"John Jones visited Syracuse,\" and not \"John\n\nJones testified that he visited Syracuse,\" which is an evidentiary fact. A\nconclusion of law would be \"John Jones has demonstrated untrustworthiness\nwithin the meaning of section\n441-c\nof\nthe Real Property Law.\" In general, it is expected that the complaint will\nallege the basic facts which would otherwise be contained in a statement of\nproposed findings of fact. In accordance with section 307(1) of the State\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act, the person assigned to render a decision will\nrule on each finding of fact. Such decision maker will do so by marking the\ninstrument setting forth the proposed findings of fact a part of the decision\nand noting in the margin thereof the ruling, i.e., \"Found,\"\n\"Not Found,\" \"Irrelevant,\" \"Evidentiary,\" \"Conclusion of Law,\" which rulings\nmay be abbreviated meaningfully. The body of the decision will contain such\nfindings of fact as the decision maker deems relevant, but need not be\nexpressed in the same language as presented in the proposed findings. (f) The chief enforcement counsel shall adopt\nthe report of the hearing officer and may, in his or her discretion, commence a\nspecial proceeding in the supreme court pursuant to sections\n16-100, 16-114\nor\n16-116\nof the\n\nElection Law should the findings of fact and conclusions of law provide a basis\nfor the commencement of such proceeding or enter into an agreement to settle\nsuch matter with the subject of the complaint.
