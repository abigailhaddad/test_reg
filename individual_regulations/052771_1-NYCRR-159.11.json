  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 159.11 - Regulatory THC testing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Testing Laboratories. (i) The Department, in\nits discretion, may conduct its regulatory testing at the Department's Food\n\nLaboratory or may authorize testing for the acceptable hemp THC level to be\nconducted, at the grower's expense, at a laboratory approved by the\n\nDepartment. (ii)\n\nGrowers shall be\nrequired to pay a fee equal to the actual cost of performing the laboratory\nanalysis for each sample tested by the Department for THC. (iii)\n\nAfter December 31, 2022, or a later\ndate established by the USDA, testing for acceptable THC levels of pre-harvest\nsamples shall be conducted only at laboratories registered with the United\n\nStates Drug Enforcement Administration. (iv)\n\nThe Department shall provide a list of\nlaboratories approved for testing. (v) Private laboratories performing\nregulatory testing shall deliver their testing reports to the Department, the\nUSDA, and the grower at the same time. (b) Testing Standards. (i) Analytical testing for detecting the\nconcentration level of THC in the sampled material shall meet the following\nstandards: (1)\n\nLaboratory quality assurance\nmust ensure the validity and reliability of test results; (2)\n\nAnalytical method selection, validation\nand verification must ensure that the testing method used is appropriate and\nthat the laboratory can successfully perform the testing; and\n(3)\n\nThe demonstration of testing validity\nmust ensure consistent accurate analytical performance. Testing method\nperformance specifications must ensure analytical tests are sufficiently\nsensitive for the purposes of the detectability requirements of this\n\nPart. (ii)\n\nAnalytical\ntesting of samples for THC must use post-decarboxylation or other similarly\nreliable methods approved by the Commissioner. The testing methodology must\nconsider the potential conversion of THCA in hemp into THC, and the test result\nmust measure the total available THC derived from the sum of the THC and the\nTHCA content. Testing methodologies meeting this requirement include, but are\nnot limited to, gas or liquid chromatography with detection. (iii)\n\nThe total THC concentration level shall\nbe determined and reported on a dry weight basis, unless the Department\ndetermines that some other method is more appropriate or accurate for the\nsubstance tested. (iv)\n\nWith each\ntest result, a measurement of uncertainty (MU) must be estimated and reported\nwith the test results. Laboratories shall use appropriate, validated methods\nand procedures for all testing activities and evaluate measurement of\nuncertainty. (c) Test\nresults. (i) Any sample test result exceeding\nthe acceptable hemp THC level shall establish a prima facie case that the lot\nrepresented by the sample is not in compliance with this Part. (ii)\n\nLots meeting the acceptable hemp THC\nlevel may enter the stream of commerce. (iii)\n\nLots tested and determined to exceed\nthe acceptable hemp THC level may not enter the stream of commerce unless\nremediated in a manner consistent with Section\n159.12\n(b) of this\n\nPart. For lots testing above the acceptable hemp THC level and not remediated, the grower shall ensure that the lot is disposed of in a manner consistent with\n\nSection\n159.12\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (iv)\n\nRemediated crops must be\nretested to ensure compliance with the acceptable THC levels. Retested\nremediated samples that exceed the acceptable hemp THC level must be disposed\nof in a manner consistent with Section\n159.12\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (v) Any grower may request\nadditional testing of the original sample, at the grower's expense, if the\ngrower has a good faith belief that the original THC concentration level\nreported in the regulatory testing results is in error. (d) The Department may provide notice of\nnon-compliance to appropriate law enforcement agencies. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n159.11\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register April 6, 2022/Volume XLIV, Issue 14, eff. 4/6/2022\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
