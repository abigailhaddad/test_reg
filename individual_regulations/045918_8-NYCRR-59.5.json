Such applications shall require the payment\nof the late filing fee enumerated in section\n59.9\nof this Part, which shall be\nin addition to the regular admission or reexamination fee. If, upon review of a\nlate application, the department determines that the applicant is ineligible to\nbe admitted to the examination, the department shall retain the late filing\nfee. In the event that the department is unable to review a late application, the late filing fee shall be refunded.

(6)\nA candidate shall not remove from the\nexamination room any of the materials provided for an examination, and shall\nnot reproduce or reconstruct any portion of the examination or answer paper, or\naid in such reproduction or reconstruction by any means, unless authorized by\nthe department.

A candidate who is reexamined in a part already\npassed shall not retain credit for such part from earlier examinations. In\nthose professions which use national or regional examinations administered by\nthe department, this subdivision shall apply whether or not the examination is\ntaken in the State of New York. (g) In those professions where reviews of examination papers are permitted, candidates will be allowed to review only those parts of the examination which\nthey failed with a score of 60 or higher. In those professions which permit\ncandidates to pass on average all scores used in computing the average are\nreviewable.
