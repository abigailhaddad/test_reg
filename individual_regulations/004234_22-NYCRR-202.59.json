This section shall\napply to every tax assessment review proceeding brought pursuant to title 1 of\narticle 7 of the Real Property Tax Law in counties outside the City of New\n\nYork.

Before the note of issue and certificate of readiness may\nbe filed, the petitioner shall have served on the respondent, in triplicate, a\nstatement that the property is not income-producing, or a copy of a verified or\ncertified statement of the income and expenses on the property for each tax\nyear under review. For the purposes of this section, a cooperative or\ncondominium apartment building shall be considered income-producing property; an owner-occupied business property shall be considered income-producing as\ndetermined by the amount reasonably allocable for rent, but the petitioner is\nnot required to make an estimate of rental income. (c) Audit. Within 60 days after\nthe service of the statement of income and expenses, the respondent, for the\npurpose of substantiating petitioner's statement of income and expenses, may\nrequest in writing an audit of the petitioner's books and records for the tax\nyears under review. If requested, the audit must be completed within 120 days\nafter the request has been made unless the court, upon good cause shown, extends the time for the audit. Failure of the respondent to request or\ncomplete the audit within the time limits shall be deemed a waiver of such\nprivilege. If an audit is requested and the petitioner fails to furnish its\nbooks and records within a reasonable time after receipt of the request, or\notherwise unreasonably impedes or delays the audit, the court, on motion of the\nrespondent, may dismiss the petition or petitions or make such other order as\nthe interest of justice requires. (d) Filing note of issue and certificate\nof readiness; additional requirements. (1)\nA note of issue and certificate of\nreadiness shall not be filed unless all disclosure proceedings have been\ncompleted and the statement of income and expenses has been served and\nfiled. (2)\nA separate\nnote of issue shall be filed for each property for each tax year. (e) Pretrial\nconference. (1)\n\nAt any time\nafter filing of the note of issue and certificate of readiness, any party to a\ntax assessment review proceeding may demand, by application served on all other\nparties and filed with the court, together with proof of such service, a\npretrial conference, or the court on its own motion may direct a pretrial\nconference at a time and date to be fixed by the court. At the pretrial\nconference, the judge shall take whatever action is warranted to expedite final\ndisposition of the proceedings, including but not limited to: (i) directing the parties to\nobtain appraisals and sales reports, and to exchange and file appraisal reports\nand sales reports by dates certain before the trial, provided that if the court\ndispenses with a pretrial conference, such exchange and filings shall be\naccomplished at least 10 days before trial; (ii)\nfixing a date for trial, or by which\nthe parties must be ready for trial; (iii)\nsigning any order\nrequired; (iv)\nconducting conferences for the purpose of facilitating settlement; and\n(v) limiting\nissues and recording stipulations of counsel. (2)\n\nFailure to comply with any\norder or directive of the court authorized by this subdivision shall be subject\nto the appropriate sanctions. (f) Consolidation or joint trial. Consolidation or joint trial of real property tax assessment review proceedings\nin the discretion of the court shall be conditioned upon service having been\nmade of the verified or certified income and expense statement, or a statement\nthat the property is not income-producing, for each of the tax years under\nreview. (g) Exchange\nand filing of appraisal reports. (1)\n\nThe exchange and filing of appraisal\nreports shall be accomplished by the following procedure: (i) The respective parties shall file\nwith the clerk of the trial court one copy, or in the event that there are two\nor more adversaries, a copy for each adversary, of all appraisal reports\nintended to be used at the trial. (ii)\n\nWhen the clerk shall have received\nall such reports, the clerk forthwith shall distribute simultaneously to each\nof the other parties a copy of the reports filed. (iii)\n\nWhere multiple parties or\nmore than one parcel is involved, each appraisal report need be served only\nupon the taxing authority and the party or parties contesting the value of the\nproperty which is the subject of the report. Each party shall provide an\nappraisal report copy for the court. (2)\n\nThe appraisal reports shall contain a\nstatement of the method of appraisal relied on and the conclusions as to value\nreached by the expert, together with the facts, figures and calculations by\nwhich the conclusions were reached. If sales, leases or other transactions\ninvolving comparable properties are to be relied on, they shall be set forth\nwith sufficient particularity as to permit the transaction to be readily\nidentified, and the report shall contain a clear and concise statement of every\nfact that a party will seek to prove in relation to those comparable\nproperties. The appraisal reports also may contain photographs of the property\nunder review and of any comparable property that specifically is relied upon by\nthe appraiser, unless the court otherwise directs. (3)\n\nWhere an appraiser appraises\nmore than one parcel in any proceeding, those parts of the separate appraisal\nreports for each parcel that would be repetitious may be included in one\ngeneral appraisal report to which reference may be made in the separate\nappraisal reports. Such general appraisal reports shall be served and filed as\nprovided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nAppraisal reports shall comply with\nany official form for appraisal reports that may be prescribed by the Chief\n\nAdministrator of the Courts. (h) Use of appraisal reports at trial. Upon the trial, expert witnesses shall be limited in their proof of appraised\nvalue to details set forth in their respective appraisal reports. Any party who\nfails to serve an appraisal report as required by this section shall be\nprecluded from offering any expert testimony on value; provided, however, upon\nthe application of any party on such notice as the court shall direct, the\ncourt may, upon good cause shown, relieve a party of a default in the service\nof a report, extend the time for exchanging reports, or allow an amended or\nsupplemental report to be served upon such conditions as the court may direct. After the trial of the issues has begun, any such application must be made to\nthe trial judge and shall be entertained only in unusual and extraordinary\ncircumstances. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
