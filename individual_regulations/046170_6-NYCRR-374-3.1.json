(2)\n\nPesticides not covered under this\n\nSubpart. The requirements of this Subpart do not apply to persons managing the\nfollowing pesticides: (i) recalled pesticides\ndescribed in subparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision, and unused pesticide\nproducts described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision, that are\nmanaged by farmers in compliance with section\n372.1\n(e)(3)(i) through\n(iii)\nof this Title. (Section\n372.1\n[e][3][i] through\n[iii]\nof this Title address pesticides\ndisposed of on the farmer's own farm in a manner consistent with the disposal\ninstructions on the pesticide label, providing the container is triple rinsed\nin accordance with Part 325 of this Title); (ii)\npesticides not meeting the conditions\nset forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. These pesticides must be\nmanaged in compliance with the hazardous waste regulations in Part 370 through\n\nSubpart 374-1, Subpart 374-4, and Part 376 of this Title, except that an\naerosol can as defined in paragraph 374-3.1(i)(1) of this section that contains\npesticides may be managed as a universal waste aerosol can under section\n374-3.2\n(d)(5)\nor\n374-3.3\n(d)(5)\nof\nthis Subpart; (iii)\npesticides that\nare not wastes under Part 371 of this Title, including those that do not meet\nthe criteria for waste generation in paragraph (3) of this subdivision or those\nthat are not wastes as described in paragraph (4) of this subdivision; and\n(iv)\npesticides that are not\nhazardous waste. A pesticide is a hazardous waste if it is listed in section\n371.4\nof this Title or if it\nexhibits one or more of the characteristics identified in section\n371.3\nof this\n\nTitle. (3)\n\nWhen a\npesticide becomes a waste. (i) A recalled\npesticide described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision becomes a waste\non the first date on which both of the following conditions apply: (a) The generator of the recalled pesticide\nagrees to participate in the recall. (b) The person conducting the recall decides\nto discard (\ne.g., burn the pesticide for energy\nrecovery). (ii)\n\nAn unused\npesticide product described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision becomes\na waste on the date the generator decides to discard it. (4)\n\nPesticides that are not wastes. The\nfollowing pesticides are not wastes: (i) Recalled pesticides described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision, provided that the person conducting the recall: (a) has not made a decision to discard\n(\ne.g., burn for energy recovery) the pesticide. Until such a\ndecision is made, the pesticide does not meet the definition of solid waste\nunder section\n371.1\n(c) of this\n\nTitle; thus the pesticide is not a hazardous waste and is not subject to\nhazardous waste requirements, including this Subpart. This pesticide remains\nsubject to the requirements of FIFRA, incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle; or\n(b) has made a decision\nto use a management option that, under section\n371.1\n(c) of this\n\nTitle, does not cause the pesticide to be a solid waste (\ni.e., the selected option is use [other than use constituting disposal] or reuse\n[other than burning for energy recovery], or reclamation). Such a pesticide is\nnot a solid waste and therefore is not a hazardous waste, and is not subject to\nthe hazardous waste requirements including this Subpart. This pesticide, including a recalled pesticide that is exported to a foreign destination for\nuse or reuse, remains subject to the requirements of FIFRA. (ii)\n\nUnused pesticide products described in\nparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision, if the generator of the unused pesticide\nproduct has not decided to discard (\ne.g., burn for energy\nrecovery) them. These pesticides remain subject to the requirements of\nFIFRA. (d) Applicability - mercury-containing equipment. (1)\n\nMercury-containing equipment covered\nunder this Subpart.
