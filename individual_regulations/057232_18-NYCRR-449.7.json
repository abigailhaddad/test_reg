  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 449.7 - Waivers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any provision of other Parts of this\n\nTitle notwithstanding and in order to encourage the development of appropriate\nprograms that will enable youth in foster care to live on their own in the\ncommunity, a written waiver of one or more of the non-statutory provisions of\nthis Part may be granted by OCFS to authorized agencies which propose to\noperate or which operate supervised setting programs. Provided however, that no\nauthorized agency may apply for a waiver regarding any requirements regarding\nnon-discrimination. Such waiver may be granted only after an authorized agency\nhas submitted to OCFS: the specific regulation or regulations for which a\nwaiver is sought; the reason a waiver is necessary; and a plan which describes\nthe operation or proposed operation of the authorized agency's supervised\nsetting program and demonstrates that granting the waiver will not create any\nhazardous conditions which could impair the health or safety of the youth, and\nOCFS has approved the waiver plan in writing. (b) An authorized agency which operates a\nsupervised setting program and which has applied for a waiver must comply with\nthe provisions of this Part until OCFS approves the requested waiver in\nwriting. (c) An authorized agency\nwhich does not operate a supervised setting program but proposes to do so\nsubject to a waiver and which submits a waiver plan to OCFS pursuant to this\nsubdivision may not operate the supervised setting program or approve any\nsupervised setting until such waiver plan has been approved pursuant to this\nsubdivision. (d) OCFS may require\nthe applicant for, or holder of, a license or operating certificate to make\nphysical plant modifications, and/or to adopt special methods, procedures, and/or policies to protect the health, safety and welfare of youth as a\ncondition of granting and maintaining a waiver granted pursuant to this\nsection. (e) Written approval of a\nrequest for a waiver will be granted only pursuant to a determination by OCFS\nthat the proposed waiver will not adversely affect the health, safety or\nwelfare of the youth in the program or facility and that the intended purpose\nof the regulation or regulations to be waived will be met. (f) Waivers may be time limited, at the\ndiscretion of OCFS. Where a waiver is time limited, the program or facility may\napply for a continuation of the waiver. If the program or facility does not\napply for a continuation of the time-limited waiver or the continuation of the\ntime-limited waiver is not granted by OCFS, the program must resume compliance\nwith the regulation or regulations for which the waiver had been issued upon\nthe expiration of the waiver. (g) Failure to adhere to the terms of the waiver and to any alternative measures\nrequired by OCFS as a condition of granting the waiver will result in recission\nof the waiver and may constitute sufficient cause for OCFS to limit, suspend, or revoke the license or operating certificate of the facility or program for\nwhich the waiver was granted. OCFS must notify the facility or program in\nwriting of the recission of a waiver, and the recission will become effective\nupon the receipt by the program of the written notification. The written\nnotification of the recission may be communicated through personal delivery, electronic mail, telefax or regular mail, at the discretion of OCFS. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
