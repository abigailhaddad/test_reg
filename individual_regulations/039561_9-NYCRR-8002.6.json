  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8002.6 - Parole violator re-release\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definition. A\ntime assessment\nis a period of time which\nis fixed as a result of a final parole revocation hearing and which determines\na date by which time the parole violator will be eligible for\nre-release. (b) How\ncalculated. (1)\n\nThe time assessment\nwill be set in months except, where applicable, it may be set as a hold to the\nmaximum expiration of the sentence. It will commence running on the date that\nthe parole violation warrant was lodged. (2)\n\nTime assessments will be calculated in\nthe same way for all parole violators for whom a time assessment has been\nimposed, irrespective of whether the violator is in a local or State\ncorrectional facility, and irrespective of whether there are criminal charges\npending against the parole violator. (3)\n\nFor any time assessment imposed, including the assessment to be served in the event the violator fails to\nsuccessfully complete an alternative program to be provided upon their return\nto a State correctional facility, if the time remaining on the sentence is less\nthan the time assessment specified by the presiding officer, such assessment\nshall be deemed a hold to the maximum expiration of the sentence. (4)\n\nWithin this section and section\n8005.20\nof this Title, sentence\nshall include sentence and post release supervision\ntime, if any. (c) (1)\n\nEligibility for re-release. All parole\nviolators identified as eligible for re-release as defined by subdivision (a)\nof this section, will be re-released to parole supervision as soon as\npracticable after completion of the delinquent time assessment imposed\nirrespective of whether they are in State or local custody. If, at the\ncompletion of the delinquent time assessment imposed, the parole violator is\nserving the balance of a definite sentence of incarceration, the parole warrant\nwill be lifted upon completion of the delinquent time assessment. However, when\npresented with one or more of the following circumstances, the board of parole\nwill consider the violator's re-release pursuant to subdivision (d) this\nsection: (i) the parole violator has engaged\nin behavior, which constitutes a violation of facility rules or has been found\nguilty of having violated such rules; (ii)\nthe parole violator has experienced a\nsignificant change in his/her emotional/mental state (which may be evidenced by\nthe parole violator's transfer to a psychiatric ward or facility, his/her\ncommitment to a mental hygiene facility, or his/her placement on a suicide\nwatch or functional equivalent); (iii)\nthe parole violator was\narrested/convicted of a new felony subsequent to the final parole revocation\nhearing; or\n(iv)\nthe board receives\nany information that supports a reasonable conclusion that the parole violator\nmay not be suitable for re-release. Such information shall include, but not be\nlimited to, information pertaining to self-destructive or threatening behavior\nby the parole violator. (d) Consideration by the parole\nboard. (1)\n\nParole violator in local\ncustody. If at any time preceding the expiration of the time assessment\nimposed, the parole violator is identified as an exception for re-release\neligibility under subdivision (c) of this section and the parole violator\nremains in local custody, the violator will be considered for re-release by the\nboard upon the violator's return to a State correctional facility. Such\nconsideration shall be through an interview by a panel of two or more members\nof the board of parole as soon as practicable from the time of the violator's\nreturn to State custody. When the Board of Parole considers the parole violator\nfor re-release, there shall be no presumption, express or implied, favoring the\nviolator's re-release. (2)\n\nParole\nviolator in State custody. If at any time preceding the expiration of the time\nassessment imposed, the parole violator is identified as an exception for\nre-release eligibility under subdivision (c) of this section and the parole\nviolator is incarcerated in a State correctional facility, then the following\nrules shall apply: (i) Consideration by the\nboard of parole of a violator in State custody may be conducted by one or more\nmembers of the board during the two-month period immediately preceding the\nexpiration of the time assessment without a personal interview. (ii)\n\nAfter considering a parole violator who\nis in State custody for re-release, the board member or members will make one\nof two possible determinations as follows: (a) the board may direct that the violator be re-released to supervision upon\nexpiration of the time assessment after a satisfactory release program is\ndeveloped and approved; or\n(b) the\nboard may require that a personal interview be conducted between a panel of two\nor more members of the board and the parole violator. When the board requires a\npersonal interview, such interview shall be conducted within a reasonable time. When, after such interview, the board again considers the parole violator for\nre-release, there shall be no presumption, express or implied, favoring the\nviolator's re-release. (iii)\n\nGrounds for requiring a personal\ninterview. Any one of the following circumstances may serve as a ground for the\nboard to require an interview between the panel of the board and the parole\nviolator: (a) the parole violator has engaged\nin behavior which constitutes a violation of facility rules or has been found\nguilty of having violated such rules; (b) the parole violator has experienced a\nsignificant change in his/her emotional/mental state (which may be evidenced by\nthe parole violator's transfer to a psychiatric ward or facility, his/her\ncommitment to a mental hygiene facility, or his/her placement on a suicide\nwatch or functional equivalent); (c) the parole violator was\narrested/convicted of a new felony subsequent to the final parole revocation\nhearing; (d) escape, absconding or\nremoval from temporary release; or\n(e) the board receives any information that\nsupports a reasonable conclusion that the parole violator may not be suitable\nfor re-release. Such information shall include, but not be limited to, information pertaining to self-destructive or threatening behavior by the\nparole violator. (e) Inapplicability to certain\ncases. The provisions of this section shall be inapplicable to any\nparole violator whose eligibility for parole release is governed by the\nstatutory requirements of a new sentence. (f) Interim procedures for certain\ncases. For those parole violators whose time assessments expired\nprior to the effective date of this section, or will expire within 90 days\nafter the effective date of this section, the provisions of subdivisions (c)\nand (d) of this section shall be deemed to be modified as follows: consideration by the board will be conducted as soon as practicable following\nadoption of this section, but may occur after expiration of the time\nassessment. This section shall not be construed to afford any parole violator a\nright to release from custody upon expiration of the time assessment, but only\na right to consideration by the board as soon as practicable. The effective\ndate of this section is April 20, 1993. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
