  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 422.3 - Reclamation plan, specific provisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The reclamation plan shall describe the\napplicant's proposed land-use objective to be achieved in the final stage of\nreclamation; the proposed method of reclaiming the affected land providing, where possible, for orderly, continuing reclamation concurrent with mining; and\na schedule for reclaiming the affected land. (b) Acceptable basic reclamation requirements\nas contained in this section shall provide for the development of the affected\nland either to a condition or physical state which is similar to and compatible\nwith that which existed prior to any mining or which encourages the future\nproductive use of the land. Basic reclamation shall include: grading and slope\ntreatment, disposal of refuse or spoil, drainage and water control features, and revegetation; proposals for the prevention of pollution, the protection of\nthe environment, the protection and perpetuation of the taxable value of\nproperty, and the protection of the property, health, safety and general\nwelfare of the people of the State. The applicability of such requirements\nshall be determined by the department on the basis of the location of the\naffected land, the type of material being mined and the natural processes to\nwhich the affected land will be subject. When the proposed reclamation plan\nconsists of subsequent construction, the site may be so prepared. In such\ncases, there must be a contractural agreement on file with the department at\nthe time mining ceases indicating that construction will commence within six\nmonths unless this period is extended by the department. The applicant must\ndemonstrate to the satisfaction of the department that adequate measures will\nbe taken to protect the environment during such period. If construction does\nnot commence within the six month period after the termination of mining, or, if construction is for any reason thereafter terminated before completion, the\npermittee shall be responsible for reclaiming the affected land to a condition\nwhich satisfies the basic reclamation requirements as contained in this\n\nSubchapter. (c) The graphic portion\nof the reclamation plan shall consist of a map or photograph prepared to the\nsame standards as for the mining plan. The information to be presented in\ngraphic form shall include: (1)\nan outline of\nthe affected land; (2)\na grading\nplan which illustrates, by the use of contours or accompanying cross sections, the proposed final grades to be established on the affected land insofar as it\nis possible to determine; and\n(3)\na\nmap which illustrates the proposed final stage of reclamation for all affected\nland including but not limited to the following: revegetated areas, drainage\nfeatures, water impoundments, building sites, recreational areas, wildlife\nareas, haulageways and any other feature consistent with the applicant's\nland-use objective and proposed reclamation method. (d) The written portion of the reclamation\nplan shall include: (1)\na description of the\napplicant's land-use objective such as: farming; pasture; forestry; recreation, industrial, commercial or residential uses; solid waste disposal; a combination\nthereof; or other uses acceptable to the department. The affected land, or a\nportion thereof, may be preserved as a scientific or historical site upon the\nrecommendation of a qualified professional in either field and with the\napproval of the department. (2)\na\ndescription of the applicant's proposed method of reclaiming the affected land\nwhich is consistent with the stated land-use objective. This description shall\ninclude, specifics relative to: the disposition of all refuse, spoil, stockpiles and personal property; the treatment of haulageways; drainage and\nwater control; water impoundments; grading and revegetation. The applicant\nshall be governed by the following standards in submitting the required\ninformation: (i) Disposition of materials. All refuse, spoil, unused mineral stockpiles and personal property shall either\nbe removed from the permit area or utilized during reclamation of the affected\nland. (a) Off-site disposal of refuse during\nreclamation shall be governed by applicable rules and regulations of the\ndepartment relative to solid waste management (refuse disposal). (b) On-site disposal of refuse shall be\naccomplished in a manner such that emanations (fumes and leachate) therefrom\nshall not cause or contribute to a condition in contravention of the\nclassifications and standards of quality and purity of the air and waters of\nthe State. Refuse and other material (clauses [d], [e] of this subparagraph)\nwhich will not support vegetative growth shall be covered to a minimum\ncompacted depth of two feet. All cover material shall be identified in the plan\nand must be acceptable to the department. Cover material which is to be\nutilized in areas to be revegetated must conform to the revegetation\nrequirements contained in this section. (c) Spoil and unused mineral stockpiles may\nbe utilized to blend areas of sharply contrasting slopes or to provide a cover\nmaterial consistent with the proposed reclamation plan. That material which is\nnot utilized for the above purposes and which remains at the mine shall be\ntreated in accordance with all other requirements for the disposition of\nmaterials, and with the requirements for grading, drainage, erosion control and\nrevegetation consistent with the applicable standards as described in this\nsubdivision. (d) Large blocks of\nrock, boulders or other similar materials which are to remain on the affected\nland shall be included in landscaping or shall be covered as described in this\nsection. (e) Trees, brush, stumps\nand other vegetative material remaining on the affected land may be burned, reduced to a mulch or covered as hereinabove described. The burning of the\nmaterial shall only be allowed if the permittee has obtained a restricted\nburning permit from the department. (f) All machinery, equipment, tools and other\npersonal property or any portion thereof shall either be removed from the\npermit area, disposed of on the site or incorporated into the final use of the\naffected land. Personal property which is disposed of on the site shall be\nconsidered as refuse and shall be treated in accordance with the standards for\nthe disposition of materials as contained in this subdivision. (ii)\n\nTreatment of haulageways. Haulageways within the permit area shall be incorporated into the final use of\nthe land or shall be reclaimed in accordance with the standards applicable to\nother affected land. (a) Those haulageways\nwhich are to be retained as public roads or travelways in conjunction with the\napplicant's land-use objectives shall be subject to applicable governmental\nrequirements. (b) Those haulageways\nwhich are not to be incorporated into the final use of the land shall be\ntreated as affected land and reclaimed in a manner which is consistent with the\nproposed final land use. (iii)\n\nDrainage. Every reasonable effort shall\nbe made to minimize the disturbance of the prevailing hydrologic balance at and\nadjacent to the mine. (a) All water\ndischarged to surface water or to groundwater shall be governed by the rules\nand regulations of the department relative to the quality and purity of the\nwaters of the State. (b) Water\ncourses or impoundments shall be provided to transmit, store or remove surface\nwater run-off and to reduce the potential for flooding and the subsequent\nerosion, siltation and pollution of adjacent streams or lands. (c) Drainage and water control features\n(channels, culverts, impoundments, etc.) which could be directly influenced by\nthe effects of flooding shall be designed to protect the property, health, safety and general welfare of the people of the State. The design standards\nshall be such that reclamation will not have a detrimental effect on such\nproperty through an increase in the amount or rate of runoff or erosion, or by\na change in the drainage pattern. (iv)\n\nWater impoundments. Water may be\nimpounded for wildlife, recreation, water control or water supply purposes\nprovided that the construction of such impoundments does not contravene the\nstandards established by the department pursuant to articles 15 and 24 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law as applied to both protected and non-protected\nwaters. (a) Water impoundments constructed\nduring mining shall either be incorporated into the final use of the land or\nshall be reclaimed in accordance with requirements for all affected\nland. (b) All water impoundments\nand associated structures shall be designed and constructed in accordance with\nacceptable engineering practice and applicable government standards. (c) All water impoundments shall be\nconstructed in a manner which allows the continuous movement of water, such as\nby evaporation, percolation or flow, and which precludes the creation of\nstagnant, or otherwise undesirable conditions. (d) All water impoundments shall be\nconstructed with features to allow a safe and convenient means of entry and\nexit for inspection or use. (e) The\ndischarge of water from any impoundment to either surface or subsurface waters\nshall be governed by the regulations of the department relative to the\npreservation of the quality and purity of such waters. (v) Grading. All mine faces and openings\nshall be treated in such a manner as to leave them in a condition which\nminimizes the possibility of rock falls, slope failure and collapse. The type\nof treatment shall be compatible with the surrounding terrain and shall be\nbased upon the natural characteristics of the material including the grain size\nof the mineral, degree of consolidation, weathering characteristics, discontinuities (areas or planes of weakness) and the height and configuration\nof a face or opening. Such treatment shall be consistent with the applicant's\nland-use objective. (a) A mine face which is\nloose or fractured and unlikely to hold a stable slope shall be stabilized by\nthe use of controlled blasting or scaling; by the use of benches, flatter\nslopes or reduced face heights or by the use of artificial rock stabilization\nmethods such as rock bolting and the application of pneumatically projected\nconcrete. (b) All ridges, peaks and\nslopes created either by excavation of a mineral or by the disposal of spoil\nshall be left no steeper than the following: rock (ledge or bedrock)--90\ndegrees depending upon the condition and characteristics of the formation as it\nexists in the mine; talus (broken rock)--37 degrees, or a slope of one vertical\non one and one- quarter horizontal, unless the talus is to be covered and\nrevegetated in which case the slope shall not exceed that which is required for\nfine sand, silt and clay; coarse sand and gravel--33 degrees, or a slope of one\nvertical on one and one-half horizontal; fine sand, silt and clay--26 degrees\nor a slope of one vertical on two horizontal. The slope provisions contained in\nthis clause may be modified with the approval of the department. (c) The perimeter of a mine shall be treated\nin a manner so as to eliminate hazards and to minimize the visual impact of the\nmine to the maximum practical extent. Treatment to minimize the visual impact\nof the mine may include the use of berms, shrub and tree plantings and\nfencing. (d) All openings to\nunderground mines shall be backfilled, sealed or otherwise treated in\naccordance with applicable Federal and State statutes and rules and\nregulations. (vi)\n\nRevegetation. A vegetative cover shall be provided on the affected land where\nvegetation is indigenous to the area and where revegetation is consistent with\nthe land-use objective as designated in an approved mined land-use plan. (a) Any area designated for revegetation\nshall be covered with an amount and type of material sufficient to support the\ngrowth of the proposed plant material. A minimum of six inches of a cover\nmaterial with a soil composition capable of sustaining plant growth shall be\nprovided on all land to be revegetated. The amount of soil cover may be reduced\nif the applicant or permittee can demonstrate that a lesser amount will be\nsufficient to support the growth of the proposed plant material in accordance\nwith the requirements contained in this subparagraph. (b) Vegetative material used in reclamation\nshall consist of grasses, legumes, herbaceous or woody plants, shrubs, trees or\na mixture thereof which is consistent with site capabilities such as drainage, pH, soil depth, available nutrients soil composition and climate. Such\nvegetation should be designed to provide a cover consistent with the stated\nland-use objective and which does not constitute a health hazard. (c) Plant material to be utilized in\nrevegetating the affected land shall be planted during the first planting\nseason following the preparation of the land for such purpose. (d) An acceptable vegetative cover shall be\nconsidered to be a permanent stand or a stand capable of regeneration and\nsuccession sufficient to assure 75 percent coverage of the areas planted if\nonly ground cover (no trees) is utilized, or a 60 percent survival rate for\nshrubs and trees which are utilized, by the end of the second growing season\nafter planting. If revegetation is not completely successful, the areas of\nfailure must be randomly distributed, shall not exceed one-half acre in every\ntwo acres so treated and shall not endanger the success of revegetation in\nadjacent areas within the affected land. (3)\nA schedule, accepted or designated by the\ndepartment which provides details as to the timing for each phase of\nreclamation. (e) The\npermittee shall reclaim all affected land within a two year period after mining\nceases unless the department shall approve a longer period. The reclamation\nperiod may be extended in the following cases: (1)\nupon submission by the permittee of\nevidence, satisfactory to the department, that reclamation cannot be completed\nwithin the approved time schedule. An extension shall be granted for this case\nonly when the permittee has made a reasonable effort to comply with the\nprovisions of title 27 and this Subchapter. (2)\nupon the temporary shutdown of a mine, during which time the permit and reclamation bond requirements shall remain in\nforce. The permittee will also be required to maintain the mine in a condition\nwhich does not result in a contravention of environmental standards. (f) The permittee shall notify the\ndepartment when reclamation of the affected land has been completed. The\ndepartment shall conduct an inspection within 15 days of receipt of said\nnotification to establish that reclamation has been performed in accordance\nwith the mined land-use plan as submitted by the permittee. If the inspection\nindicates that the permittee has not complied with the reclamation provisions\nof the mined land-use plan, reclamation shall not be approved. In such case, the permittee shall be required to correct inadequacies encountered during the\ndepartment's review process. If the department determines that the permittee\nhas complied with the reclamation provisions of the mined land-use plan, reclamation shall be approved and the bond shall be released except as provided\nin section\n423.3\n(c) of this\n\nPart.
