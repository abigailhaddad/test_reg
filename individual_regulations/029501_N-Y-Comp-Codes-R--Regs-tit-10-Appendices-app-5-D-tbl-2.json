Where well water sources may be potentially influenced by\nsurface water, appropriate water quality testing shall be done in accordance\nwith Department guidance to determine if the well water source is directly\ninfluenced by surface water. 2 CWS means community water system as defined in 10 NYCRR\nSubpart\n5-1. NTNCWS means nontransient noncommunity water system as defined in\n10 NYCRR Subpart\n5-1. TNCWS means a public water system that is neither a CWS\nnor a NTNCWS. 3 Specified duration is the minimum required pumping period\nand must include a minimum of six hours of stabilized drawdown at the end of\nthe test except as allowed under subdivision 5-D.4(d) of this Appendix. 4 LHD means local health department as defined in Appendix\n5-B. 5 For wells located in areas that have the potential to draw\nwater from carbonate aquifers, the local health department may determine based\nupon a hydrogeologic assessment, records of well logs, and/or other local\ngeologic data that the aquifer is unlikely to show a surface water influence\nassociated with karst topography. Where such determination is made, GWUDI\ntesting need not be done. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 10, Appendices, app 5-D, tbl. 2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
