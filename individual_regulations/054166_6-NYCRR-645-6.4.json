  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 645-6.4 - Hearing participation\n\nState Regulations\n\nParticipation in the hearing may be full or limited, depending upon the degree of interest and involvement sought in the proceeding. Members of the public who do not intend to introduce evidence but who wish to\nhave their arguments recorded shall only be permitted to make a limited\nappearance. (a) The parties to a\nhearing shall be: (1)\nthe\napplicant; (2)\nthe commission\nstaff; and\n(3)\nother interested\npersons who meet the requirements in subdivision (b) of this section. (b) To obtain party status, a\nperson must file, in writing and by the date set in the notice of hearing, a\nstatement of position which identifies: (1)\nthe person's grounds of support or opposition to the project, including a\ndemonstration of the social, economic or environmental interests of the person\nwhich are likely to be affected by the proposed project; and\n(2)\nthe nature of the argument and evidence\nwhich the person intends to present, and any other matter believed\nrelevant. (c) If a\nsufficient filing is not made, the hearing officer has discretion to deny party\nstatus or require additional information from the person requesting party\nstatus. The hearing officer's ruling on party status shall be based upon a\nfinding that sufficient interest, as described in paragraph (b)(1) of this\nsection, has been demonstrated. (d) The hearing officer may limit the participation of a party to those areas in\nwhich its identified interest may be affected, or in which its expertise would\nprove beneficial to the development of a factual record. (e) The hearing officer may allow any person\nmeeting the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section to become a party at\nany time during the hearing if it is shown: (1)\nthat good cause exists for failure to\nfile on time; (2)\nthat no party\nwill be unreasonably disadvantaged or otherwise prejudiced; and\n(3)\nthat the person's participation will\nmaterially contribute to a complete record. (f) Any ruling of the hearing officer denying\nor limiting party status may, within seven days of the ruling, be appealed in\nwriting to the commission which shall decide the appeal at its next regular\nmeeting following receipt of all papers filed in connection with the appeal. Notice of the appeal and a copy of all briefs submitted in support thereof\nshall be presented to the commission. Upon receipt of an appeal, the hearing\nofficer shall decide whether to adjourn the hearing or to make such other order\nprotecting the interests of the parties and the person initiating the appeal as\njustice requires, including an order that witnesses may be recalled should the\ndecision be reversed. (g) A person\nwho is not a party may make a limited appearance by either submitting a written\nstatement to the hearing officer at the hearing or requesting, at or prior to\nthe opening of the hearing, to make an oral statement. Such a person shall have\nthe right to present unsworn written and oral statements on issues of law and\nfact relevant to the hearing at such times and to the extent as established by\nthe hearing officer. Such statements: (1)\ndo\nnot have the weight or importance of sworn statements or other evidence; and\n(2)\nshall be appropriately\nconsidered by the hearing officer and the commission in weighing the evidence\nand in making statutory and regulatory conclusions of law. (h) Consolidation of parties. If a hearing involves numerous parties, some or all of\nwhom have similar viewpoints and input, in order to avoid repetitious testimony\nor argument the hearing officer may: (1)\nlimit the number of witnesses on a given\nissue or subject, in order to avoid needless presentation of duplicative\nevidence; (2)\nlimit the scope of\ncross-examination to matters not previously subject to\ncross-examination; (3)\nlimit the\nnumber of rebuttal witnesses and the scope of their testimony; (4)\nlimit the time for oral argument and/or\nrequire written briefs or submission; (5)\nutilize a panel of witnesses for purposes\nof direct testimony or cross-examination; and\n(6)\ntake other reasonable measures to\nminimize repetitious testimony or argument.
