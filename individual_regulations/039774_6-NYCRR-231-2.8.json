Tit. 6 §§ 231-2.8 - Internal offsets, severe ozone nonattainment area only\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis section represents a mechanism for avoiding a\ndetermination of applicability of this Subpart, for emissions of VOC or NO\nx\nin the severe ozone nonattainment area only, in those\ninstances where a significant source project is proposed at an existing major\nfacility and a net emission increase determination of non-applicability is not\npossible. (a) Internal offset\napplicability. An internal offset shall be considered for purposes of\ndetermining applicability or degree of control required under section\n231-2.2\n(b)(1) or\n(2)\nof this Subpart for a proposed source\nproject at an existing major facility in the severe ozone nonattainment area, for emissions of VOC or NO\nx\nonly. An internal offset\nshall only be considered subsequent to a net emission increase\ndetermination. (b) Use of an ERC as\npart of an internal offset. An ERC shall meet the following conditions to be\nused as part of an internal offset: (1)\nsuch\nan ERC shall come from an emission unit within the same existing major facility\nas a proposed source project; (2)\nsuch an ERC shall have physically occurred on or after November 15, 1990, but\nneed not be contemporaneous with a proposed source project for which the\nreduction is used; and\n(3)\nsuch an\nERC, or portion thereof, shall be described as a special condition in the\npermit for the proposed source project for which the reduction is\nused. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n231-2.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
