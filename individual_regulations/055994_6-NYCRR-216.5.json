  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 216.5 - Gaseous emissions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nOwners and/or operators of facilities\nlocated in the lower Orange County or New York City metropolitan areas with an\nannual potential to emit of 25 tons or more of nitrogen oxides or 25 tons or\nmore of volatile organic compounds must comply with the requirements of this\nsection. (2)\n\nOwners and/or\noperators of facilities located outside of the lower Orange County and New York\n\nCity metropolitan areas with an annual potential to emit of 100 tons or more of\nnitrogen oxides or 50 tons or more of volatile organic compounds must comply\nwith the requirements of this section. (b) Owners and/or operators of emission\npoints subject to this Part which emit nitrogen oxides or volatile organic\ncompounds located at facilities described in subdivision (a) of this section\nmust submit a compliance plan to the department by October 20, 1994. The\ncompliance plan must either include the reasonably available control technology\n(RACT) analysis required by subdivision (c) of this section or a plan to limit\nthe annual potential to emit below the applicability levels pursuant to\nsubdivision (d) of this section. (c) (1)\n\nThe plan must identify reasonably\navailable control technology for each emission point. The compliance plan must\nidentify the emission points which do not employ reasonably available control\ntechnology (RACT), and must include a schedule for implementation of RACT. Reasonably available control technology as approved by the department must be\nimplemented on each emission point subject to this section by May 31, 1995. (2)\n\nCompliance plans which\ninclude construction of emission control equipment must include a milestone\ndate not later than December 20, 1994 for submission to the department of\npermit to construct applications. These compliance plans must include milestone\ndates for commencement of construction, completion of construction, and\ncompletion of emissions testing of emission control equipment. (3)\n\nReasonably available control technology\ncompliance plans for nitrogen oxide emission points must include technically\nfeasible control strategies to minimize nitrogen oxide formation and emission\ncontrol equipment alternatives. (4)\n\nThese process specific RACT demonstrations which are acceptable to the\ndepartment will be submitted to the United States Environmental Protection\n\nAgency for approval as a revision to the State Implementation Plan by the\ndepartment. (d) The owner\nor operator of any facility with federally and state enforceable conditions in\ncertificates to operate which limit the annual potential to emit nitrogen\noxides and volatile organic compounds below the applicability levels of\nsubdivision (a) of this section by May 31, 1995 is exempt from the RACT\nanalysis and implementation requirements of this section. Records must be\nmaintained by the owner or operator on a monthly basis at the facility which\nverify the facility's annual actual emissions. Upon reasonable request, these\nrecords must be submitted to the department in a format acceptable to the\ndepartment. An exceedance of the annual potential to emit conditions for any\ncalendar year must be reported by the owner or operator to the department\nwithin 30-days after the calendar year ends. (e) Any facility that is subject to this\nsection after May 31, 1995 will remain subject to these provisions even if the\nannual potential to emit nitrogen oxides or volatile organic compounds later\nfall below the applicability threshold. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n216.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
