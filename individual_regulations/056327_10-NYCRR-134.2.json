(2)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of Lake Ontario or tributary watercourses within the limiting distance from the intake of the public water supply of the village of Lyndonville, as previously defined, except a properly constructed and operated sewage disposal plant as hereinafter set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d). (3)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind, used for the temporary storage of human excreta, located between the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subdivision, unless said pit or other receptacle is made watertight and so arranged and equipped that the said excreta or sewage are at once removed by pump or other satisfactory means through watertight pipes or conduits to some proper place of ultimate disposal, as hereinafter provided, shall be arranged in such a manner that all such excreta shall be received in suitable watertight receptacles and shall be at all times disposed of as hereinafter set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision.
