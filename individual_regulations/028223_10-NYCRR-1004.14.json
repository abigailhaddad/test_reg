Tit. 10 § 1004.14 - Laboratory testing requirements for medical marihuana\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Medical marihuana products produced by a\nregistered organization shall be examined in a laboratory located in New York\n\nState that is licensed by the department's Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement and\napproved for the analysis of medical marihuana by the department in accordance\nwith article 5 of the Public Health Law and Subpart 55-2 of this\n\nTitle. (b) No board member, officer, manager, owner, partner, principal stakeholder or member of a\nregistered organization, or such persons' immediate family member, shall have\nan interest or voting rights in the laboratory performing medical marihuana\ntesting. (c) For final product\ntesting, the registered organization shall submit to the laboratory a\nstatistically significant number of samples containing the final medical\nmarihuana product equivalent to the sealed medical marihuana product dispensed\nto the patient (e.g., liquid extract in a sealed bottle or intact sealed bottle\nof capsules). Upon prior written approval of the department, a registered\norganization may submit to the laboratory the final medical marihuana product\nsample packaged in a quantity less than that which would be provided to the\npatient if the sample is prepared and packaged in the identical manner as the\nproduct provided to the patient. (d) Testing of the final medical marihuana\nproduct is mandatory. However, at the option of the registered organization, testing may be performed on components used for the production of the final\nmedical marihuana product including but not limited to water or growing\nmaterials. Testing may also be performed on the final marihuana extract e.g. for cannabinoid profile verification or contaminant testing. (e) Sampling and testing of each lot of final\nmedical marihuana product shall be conducted with a statistically significant\nnumber of samples and with acceptable methodologies, approved by the\ndepartment, such that there is assurance that all lots of each medical\nmarihuana product are adequately assessed for contaminants and the cannabinoid\nprofile is consistent throughout. (f) Testing of the cannabinoid profile shall\ninclude, at a minimum, those analytes specified in section\n1004.11\n(c)(2)\nof\nthis Part. (g) Testing for\ncontaminants in the final medical marihuana product shall include but shall not\nbe limited to those analytes listed below. The department shall make available\na list of required analytes and their acceptable limits as determined by the\ncommissioner. Analyte: E. coli\n\nPseudomonas (for products to be vaporized)\n\nSalmonella species\n\nEnterococcus species\n\nBile tolerant gram negative bacteria, specifically including\n\nKlebsiella species\n\nClostridium botulinum\n\nAspergillus species\n\nMucor species\n\nPenicillium species\n\nThermophilic Actinomycetes species\n\nAflatoxins B1, B2, G1, G2\n\nOchratoxin A\nAntimony\n\nArsenic\n\nCadmium\n\nChromium\n\nCopper\n\nLead\n\nNickel\n\nZinc\n\nMercury\n\nAny pesticide used during production of the medical marihuana\nproduct\n\nAny growth regulator used during production of the medical\nmarihuana product\n\nAny other analyte as required by the\ncommissioner\n(h) laboratories performing final product testing pursuant to this section must\nreport all results to the department, in a manner and timeframe prescribed by\nthe department. (i) Stability\ntesting shall be performed on each brand and form of medical marihuana product\nas follows: (1)\n\nFor testing of open products, stability testing shall be performed for each extract lot, at time zero when\nopened and then, at a minimum, at 60 days from the date of first analysis. This\nshall establish use of the product lot within a specified time once\nopened. (2)\n\nFor testing of unopened\nproducts, until stability studies have been completed, a registered\norganization may assign a tentative expiration date based on available\nstability information. The registered organization must concurrently have\nstability studies conducted by an approved laboratory to determine the actual\nexpiration date of an unopened product. (3)\n\nFor stability testing of both opened and\nunopened products, each brand shall retain a total THC and total CBD\nconcentration in milligrams per single dose that is consistent with section\n1004.11\n(c)(3)\nof\nthis Part. If stability testing demonstrates that a product no longer retains a\nconsistent concentration of THC and CBD pursuant to section\n1004.11\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Part, the product shall be deemed no longer suitable for dispensing or\nconsumption. The department may request further stability testing of a brand to\ndemonstrate the ongoing stability of the product produced over time. (4)\n\nThe department may waive any of the\nrequirements of this subdivision upon good cause shown. (j) The laboratory shall track and use an\napproved method to dispose of any quantity of medical marihuana product that is\nnot consumed in samples used for testing. Disposal of medical marihuana shall\nmean that the medical marihuana has been rendered unrecoverable and beyond\nreclamation. (k) Any submitted\nmedical marihuana products that are deemed unsuitable for testing shall be\nreturned to the registered organization under chain of\ncustody. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
