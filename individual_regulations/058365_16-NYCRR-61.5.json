  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 61.5 - Establishment of original cost and accrual depreciation\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhere return is involved or claimed, the utility shall\nestablish by competent evidence the original cost of the property used and\nuseful in the service to which the rates, rules and regulations involved in the\nproceeding relate and the accrued depreciation thereon. All property not so\nused and useful shall be excluded (note particularly of section\n61.3\n[d][5]\nof\nthis Part). Accrued depreciation as used herein means the loss or depletion in\nworth or value, compared with a specified cost new, due to all causes which\nbring about the ultimate retirement of the property, such as wear and tear, decay, action of the elements, inadequacy, obsolescence, changes in the art, changes in demand and requirements of public authorities. Departure from\nnewness, estimated cost of needed repairs or that part of depreciation which\nmay be measured by inspection alone will not be accepted as satisfactory\nevidence of the total amount of accrued depreciation actually existing in the\nproperty. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n61.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
