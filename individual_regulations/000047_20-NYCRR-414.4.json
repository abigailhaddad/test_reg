  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 414.4 - Diplomatic missions and diplomatic personnel\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 284(1)\n(a) Diplomatic missions and diplomatic\npersonnel, as retail purchasers of motor fuel, are exempt from the motor fuel\ntax imposed pursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law, only to the extent\nprovided for in this section. Such provisions are predicated on the United\n\nState's Department of State's Office of Foreign Missions' national tax\nexemption program. (b) (1)\n\nDiplomatic missions\nas\nused in this section means permanent missions to the United Nations and foreign\nembassies and consulates. (2)\n\nDiplomatic personnel\nas used in this section means foreign\nembassy and consular officials, certain foreign embassy and consular employees, certain officers and employees of the United Nations, of international\norganizations and of permanent missions to the United Nations and certain\nemployees of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs. (c) (1)\n\nIn order for diplomatic missions and\ndiplomatic personnel to receive an exemption from the motor fuel tax, such\nmission or personnel must establish its exempt status with the United States\n\nDepartment of State or, in the case of employees of the Coordination Council\nfor North American Affairs, with the American Institute in Taiwan. The United\n\nStates Department of State or the American Institute in Taiwan must then\ncertify to an oil company which issues credit cards, that such mission or\npersonnel is exempt from the motor fuel tax. Diplomatic missions or diplomatic\npersonnel seeking exemption from tax must then obtain credit cards from such an\noil company. Although no exemption from tax is allowed at the time of the\nretail sale of the fuel, purchases of motor fuel charged to authorized credit\ncards will be billed exclusive of the tax from which the purchaser is exempt. Retail sellers of motor fuel may not sell such fuel to diplomatic missions or\npersonnel without passing through the motor fuel tax at the time of the\nsale. (2)\n\nOil companies, which in\nagreement with the United States Department of State or the American Institute\nin Taiwan have issued authorized credit cards to diplomatic missions and\ndiplomatic personnel, may bill such missions and personnel for credit card\npurchases of motor fuel, exclusive of the motor fuel tax. Such oil companies\nare entitled to a refund or credit of such tax in the amount which they have\nreimbursed directly or indirectly the retail seller of such fuel or the amount\nthey themselves may be liable to remit directly to the Department of Taxation\nand Finance. Sufficient records must be maintained to verify the amounts of all\nrefunds and credits claimed on the basis of credit card sales to diplomatic\nmissions and diplomatic personnel. (d) (1)\n\nTax\nexemption cards issued to diplomatic missions and diplomatic personnel by the\n\nUnited States Department of State or the American Institute in Taiwan may not\nbe used to purchase motor fuel upon which the seller has not passed through the\nmotor fuel tax. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding\nany other provision of this Subchapter, no tax exemption will be provided nor\nwill a refund, credit or reimbursement be granted where diplomatic missions or\ndiplomatic personnel purchase motor fuel by any means other than through the\nuse of an authorized oil company credit card. (3)\n\nThe provisions of this section are also\napplicable to the administration of the tax imposed on diesel motor fuel\npursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law and the sales and compensating use\ntaxes imposed on motor fuel and diesel motor fuel pursuant to articles 28 and\n29 of such law.
