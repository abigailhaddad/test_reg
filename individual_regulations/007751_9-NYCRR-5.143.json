Tit. 9 § 5.143 - Executive Order No. 143: Directing the Commissioner of the Division of Criminal Justice Services to Expand the State DNA Identification Index to Include DNA Identification Profiles Obtained From Additional Convicted Offenders. [*]\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, it is the first obligation of government to\nprotect its citizens from crime and violence; WHEREAS, the introduction of DNA technology represents the\nmost important application of forensic science in law enforcement since the\ndevelopment of fingerprint technology; WHEREAS, DNA is a proven, powerful crime-fighting tool that\nhas helped to convict the guilty, exonerate the innocent, reduce recidivism and\nbring justice to victims and their families; WHEREAS, the State first established a DNA Identification\n\nIndex (\"DNA Databank\") in 1996, and the DNA Databank currently includes DNA\nidentification profiles from persons convicted of certain designated criminal\noffenses; WHEREAS, the Division of Criminal Justice Services is\nauthorized, pursuant to Executive Law § 995-c, to establish and revise the\nframework for the operation of the DNA Databank and the type of profiles that\nmay be included in the Databank through an implementation plan which is subject\nto review and approval by the New York State Commission on Forensic Science and\nthe DNA Subcommittee; WHEREAS, the Legislature expanded the DNA Databank in 1999\nto require the collection of DNA profiles of all persons convicted of violent\nfelony offenses and again in 2004 to require the collection of DNA profiles\nfrom persons convicted of a felony or misdemeanor under the Sex Offender\n\nRegistry Act, crimes of terrorism, felony hate crimes and other specified\nfelonies; WHEREAS, the 1999 and 2004 expansions of the DNA Databank\nhave resulted in more than 1,600 \"hits\" linking crime scene evidence to\noffenders in the DNA Databank; WHEREAS, of the more than 1,100 offenders linked to sexual\nassault cases through the DNA Databank, more than 80% were included in the DNA\nDatabank for a crime other than a sex related offense; WHEREAS, more than half of the individuals who are\nconvicted of felony offenses in the State still are not required to provide a\nDNA sample for inclusion in the DNA Databank; WHEREAS, the State's DNA Databank currently contains crime\nscene DNA evidence from more than 16,000 unsolved crimes in the State that\ncould lead to the identification of the perpetrator if the DNA Databank were\nexpanded; WHEREAS, I have repeatedly proposed legislation that would\nexpand the DNA Databank to include the DNA profiles of all convicted\noffenders; WHEREAS, while the State Senate has passed my proposed\nlegislation by overwhelming, bi-partisan majorities, the State Assembly has\nrefused to allow the bill to the floor for a vote; WHEREAS, consistent with our obligation to protect New\n\nYorkers from crime and violence, it is imperative that all State agencies take\nall appropriate steps within the bounds of current law to add the DNA profiles\nof convicted offenders to the DNA Databank; WHEREAS, some convicted offenders who are not currently\nrequired to provide a DNA sample for inclusion in the DNA Databank are\npresently under the jurisdiction of the Division of Parole (\"Parole\"), and must\ncomply with various requirements imposed by Parole as a condition of\nparole; WHEREAS, some convicted offenders who are not currently\nrequired to provide a DNA sample for inclusion in the DNA Databank are\npresently serving sentences of probation or are subject to interim probation\nsupervision, and must comply with various requirements imposed by the\nsentencing court or supervising authority, as applicable, as a condition of\nsuch probation and interim probation supervision; WHEREAS, some convicted offenders who are not currently\nrequired to provide a DNA sample for inclusion in the DNA Databank presently\nare serving sentences of State imprisonment with the Department of Correctional\n\nServices (\"DOCS\") and are eligible to participate in voluntary programs, at the\ndiscretion of DOCS, that confer significant benefits upon inmate participants\nand require inmates to agree to conditions prescribed by DOCS as a condition of\nparticipation; WHEREAS, some convicted offenders who are not currently\nrequired to provide a DNA sample for inclusion in the DNA Databank were\nconvicted pursuant to a voluntary plea agreement, and must comply with various\nrequirements established by the sentencing court, in consultation with the\nprosecution, as a condition of such plea; WHEREAS, expanding the DNA Databank to include DNA profiles\nfrom convicted offenders who are currently under Parole supervision, who are\nserving a sentence of probation or interim probation supervision, who will\nparticipate in DOCS voluntary programs or who negotiate voluntary plea\nagreements would, inter alia, aid in solving past and future\ncrimes, discourage recidivism, ensure that prison, parole and probation\nofficials are aware of prior violent crimes committed by a person in their\ncustody or under their supervision, and detect crimes committed by persons\nwhile under Parole supervision or while serving a sentence of probation or\nwhile participating in a DOCS voluntary program; NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE E. PATAKI, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\n\nLaws of the State of New York, do hereby direct the Commissioner of the\n\nDivision of Criminal Justice Services to promulgate a DNA Databank\nimplementation plan that would include within the Databank an additional index\nconsisting of DNA identification profiles obtained from convicted offenders\npursuant to a plea agreement, as a condition of the DOCS Temporary Release\n\nProgram, the DOCS CASAT Program, the DOCS Shock Incarceration Program, release\non parole, post release supervision, presumptive release, conditional release, or as a condition of probation or interim probation supervision. FURTHER, I do hereby direct the Commissioner of the\n\nDivision of Criminal Justice Services to submit such DNA Databank\nimplementation plan to the DNA Subcommittee and the Commission on Forensic\n\nScience forthwith for review and approval pursuant to Executive Law §\n995-c(2). FURTHER, upon approval of such DNA Databank implementation\nplan, I do hereby order the Commissioner of the Division of Criminal Justice\n\nServices to promulgate, modify, adopt or rescind any rules or regulations, or\nemergency rules or regulations, or directives, as may be necessary to\nadminister such plan. FURTHER, upon approval of such DNA Databank implementation\nplan, I do hereby order the Division of Parole to promulgate, modify, adopt or\nrescind any rules or regulations, or emergency rules or regulations, or\ndirectives, as may be necessary from time to time, to permit, as a condition of\nparole, at the discretion of the Parole Board or appropriate Parole authority, the submission of a DNA sample if such parolee s DNA identification profile is\nnot already part of the DNA Databank. FURTHER, upon approval of such DNA Databank implementation\nplan, I do hereby order the Division of Probation and Correctional Alternatives\nto promulgate, modify, adopt or rescind any rules or regulations, or emergency\nrules or regulations, or directives, as may be necessary from time to time, to\npermit, as a condition of probation or interim probation supervision, at the\ndiscretion of the sentencing court and supervising authority where applicable\ninterstate cases, the submission of a DNA sample if such offender's DNA\nidentification profile is not already part of the DNA Databank. FURTHER, upon approval of such DNA Databank implementation\nplan, I do hereby order the Commissioner of the Department of Correctional\n\nServices to promulgate, modify, adopt or rescind any rules or regulations, or\nemergency rules or regulations, or directives, as may be necessary from time to\ntime, to prevent the future acceptance of an inmate into the Temporary Release\n\nProgram, CASAT Program, or the Shock Incarceration Program, if such inmate's\nDNA identification profile is not already part of the DNA Databank and such\ninmate refuses to provide a DNA sample. FURTHER ORDERED, that said rules and regulations or\nemergency rules and regulations are responsive to emergencies affecting the\npublic safety or welfare and are exempt from any restrictions imposed pursuant\nto Executive Order Number 20.
