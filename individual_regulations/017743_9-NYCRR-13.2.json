Blank forms may be obtained from the secretary either personally on\nany workday at the Office of the Secretary at the State Capitol in Albany or by\nmail, addressed to such office. Completed forms may be submitted to the\nsecretary either personally at such office on any workday between the hours of\n9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. or by mail, addressed to such office or to such other\noffice as the secretary may specify on the application form. Upon receipt of\nsuch an application, in the proper form and at the appropriate time, the\nsecretary shall search for the record requested. If the secretary determines\nthat the record requested is not in his custody, the secretary shall advise the\napplicant, as the case may be, (i) that the record does not exist, (ii) that\nthe record is in the custody of another specified agency, or (iii) that the\nrecord was in his custody but has been lost. If the secretary determines that\nthe record requested is in his custody, the secretary shall either (i) produce\nthe record for inspection at his office (and, if so requested and upon payment\nof the appropriate fee, shall make and certify a copy of the record), (ii)\nadvise the applicant that the record is in his custody and make arrangements\nfor inspection and/or copying at a later time, or (iii) deny access to the\nrecord as provided in section seven of this Regulation. The secretary, in his\ndiscretion, may waive compliance with any formality prescribed by this\nsubdivision, including the use of application forms prescribed by the\nsecretary. (b) The Fiscal Officer\nshall be the custodian of the payroll record of the Executive Chamber. Any bona\nfide member of the news media wishing to inspect and/or obtain a copy of such\npayroll record may make application to the Fiscal Officer in writing on forms\nprescribed by the Comptroller. Application to inspect and/or obtain a copy of\nsuch payroll record shall be made to the Fiscal Officer by the member\npersonally on any workday during regular working hours at the office of the\n\nFiscal Officer at the State Capitol in Albany, or such other place as he may\ndirect.

If the member requests a copy of such payroll record, the\n\nFiscal Officer shall provide him with one. § 4. List of records. On behalf of the\n\nExecutive Chamber, the secretary shall maintain and make available for\ninspection and copying at his office a current list, reasonably detailed by\nsubject matter, of the types of records produced, filed or first kept in the\n\nExecutive Chamber on and after September 1, 1974.

In the event that one or more deletion\nis so made from any document, the secretary shall provide written notice of\nthat fact to the person given access to the record. If the record is such that\nthe personal matters cannot be fully deleted without substantively affecting\nthe record or the identifying details cannot be effectively deleted, the\nsecretary shall deny access to such record as provided in section seven of this\n\nRegulation. § 7. Grant or\ndenial of access to records. If the secretary determines that an application to\ninspect and/or copy records pertains to information required to be disclosed\nunder paragraph a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h or i of subdivision one of section\neighty eight\nof the Public Officers Law and not exempt from disclosure as an unwarranted\ninvasion of personal privacy or otherwise, he shall grant the application. If\nthe secretary determines that an application to inspect and/or copy records\npertains to other information not exempt from disclosure as an unwarranted\ninvasion of personal privacy or otherwise, he shall grant the application\nunless he determines that to do so would adversely affect the public interest. If the secretary determines that an application to inspect and/or copy records\npertains to information specifically exempted from disclosure by paragraph a, b, c or d of subdivision seven of section\neighty eight\nof the Public Officers Law or under section six of this Regulation pursuant to\nsubdivision three of section eighty-eight of such law, he shall deny such\napplication. In denying any application to inspect and/or copy records the\nsecretary shall indicate his reason for such denial and shall advise the\napplicant of his right to appeal such denial to the counsel. § 8. Appeals. Any person whose\napplication to inspect and/or copy records has been denied pursuant to section\nseven of this Regulation may appeal such denial to the counsel at his office at\nthe State Capitol in Albany.

The counsel shall, upon receipt of a written appeal, immediately review the matter and affirm, modify or reverse the denial. If the counsel affirms or modifies the denial, he\nshall, within seven days of receipt of the appeal: (1)\ncommunicate his reasons for such\naffirmation or modification to the person making the appeal; and\n(2)\ninform such person of his right to appeal\nsuch affirmation or modification under article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and\n\nRules. § 9.
