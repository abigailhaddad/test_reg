  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 201-6.3 - Application and permit review by EPA and affected states\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Transmission of information to the\nadministrator'. (1)\n\nThe department shall\nprovide the administrator a copy of each title V permit application, including\nany application for permit modification, each proposed permit, and each final\ntitle V facility permit. Accessibility to the administrator of the application, proposed permit, or final permit on the department's computer system shall be\nconsidered equivalent to the submission of these documents to the administrator\nby the department. The applicant may be required by the department to provide a\ncopy of the permit application (including the compliance plan) directly to the\nadministrator. To the extent practicable, the preceding information shall be\nprovided in computer-readable format compatible with the EPA national database\nmanagement system. (2)\n\nThe\nadministrator may waive the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision\nand paragraph (b)(1) of this section for any category of emission sources\n(including any class, type, or size within such category) other than major\nfacilities according to the following: (i) by\nregulation for a category of emission sources nationwide; or\n(ii)\nat the time of approval of the State\nprogram for a category of facilities covered by an individual permitting\nprogram. (3)\n\nThe\ndepartment shall keep such records for five years and submit to the\nadministrator such information as the administrator may reasonably require to\nascertain whether the State program complies with the requirements of the act\nor of 40 CFR part\n70. (b) 'Review by affected states'. (1)\n\nThe department shall give notice of each\ndraft permit to any affected state on or before the time that the department\nprovides this notice to the public under the requirements of this Part or Part\n621 of this Title. (2)\n\nThe\ndepartment, as part of the submittal of the proposed permit to the\nadministrator (or as soon as possible after the submittal for minor permit\nmodification procedures allowed under section\n201-6.6\nof this Subpart), shall\nnotify the administrator and affected states in writing of any refusal by the\ndepartment to accept all recommendations for the proposed permit that the\naffected state submitted during the public or affected state review period. The\nnotice shall include the department's reasons for not accepting any such\nrecommendation. The department is not required to accept recommendations that\nare not based on applicable requirements or the requirements of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nWithin five working days\nof receipt of a complete permit modification application, the department shall\nmeet its obligation to notify the administrator and affected states of the\nrequested permit modification. The department promptly shall send any required\nnotice to the administrator. (c) 'EPA objection'. (1)\n\nThe administrator may object to the\nissuance of any proposed permit determined by the administrator not to be in\ncompliance with applicable requirements or requirements under this Part. No\npermit for which an application must be transmitted to the administrator shall\nbe issued if the administrator objects to its issuance in writing within 45\ndays of receipt of the proposed permit and all necessary supporting\ninformation. (2)\n\nAny EPA objection\nshall include a statement of the administrator's reasons for objection and a\ndescription of the terms and conditions that the permit must include to respond\nto the objections. The administrator will provide the permit applicant a copy\nof the objection. (3)\n\nFailure of\nthe department to do any of the following also shall constitute grounds for an\nobjection: (i) comply with subdivisions (a)\nor (b) of this section; (ii)\nsubmit\nany information necessary to review adequately the proposed permit; or\n(iii)\nprocess the permit under\nthe procedures approved to meet the public participation requirements of Part\n621 of this Title except for minor permit modifications. (4)\n\nIf the department f ails to revise and\nsubmit a proposed permit in response to an objection with in 9 0 days of the\nobjection, the administrator may issue or deny the permit in accordance with\nthe requirements of the Federal program promulgated under title V of the\nact. (d) 'Public\npetitions to the administrator'. If the administrator does not object in\nwriting under subdivision (c) of this section, any person may petition the\nadministrator within 60 days after the expiration of the administrator's 45-day\nreview period to make such objection. Any such petition shall be based only on\nobjections to the permit that were raised with reasonable specificity during\nthe public comment period, unless the petitioner demonstrates that it was\nimpracticable to raise such objections within such period, or unless the\ngrounds for such objection arose after such period. If the administrator\nobjects to the permit as a result of a petition filed under this paragraph, the\ndepartment shall not issue the permit until EPA's objection has been resolved, except that a petition for review does not stay the effectiveness of a permit\nor its requirements if the permit was issued after the end of the 45-day review\nperiod and prior to an EPA objection. If the department has issued a permit\nprior to receipt of an EPA objection under this paragraph, the administrator\nwill modify, terminate, or revoke such permit, and shall do so consistent with\nthe procedures in section 201-6.6 (e) of this Subpart, except in unusual\ncircumstances, and the department may thereafter issue only a modified permit\nthat satisfies EPA's objection. In any case, the facility owner and/or operator\nwill not be in violation of the requirement to have submitted a timely and\ncomplete application. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
