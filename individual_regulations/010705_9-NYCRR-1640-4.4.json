  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-4.4 - Reimbursement of advances\n\nState Regulations\n\nAs has been previously pointed out, the local agency\nmust look to sources other than advances made or to be made by the State for\nfunds to pay indeterminate expenditures. The local agency may use any funds it\nhas available for the purpose. A common source is a loan or appropriation by\nthe municipality. Upon audit, review, and written approval by the division, the\nlocal agency may use loan funds advanced or to be advanced by the State to\nreimburse itself or its creditors to the extent that the indeterminate\nexpenditures, within the maximum limitation set in advance by the division, have been declared by the division to be eligible to be charged to development\ncosts. Funds of other State-aided projects shall not be used to pay\nindeterminate expenditures of another project or to reimburse such\nexpenditures. No reimbursement shall be made from loan funds advanced or to be\nadvanced by the State for a specific project under a given contract for State\naid until an auditor of the division has examined the expenditures and reported\nhis findings to the division for ruling, and the local agency shall have\nreceived written approval of the division as to admitted development costs. Indeterminate expenditures which have been reimbursed out of funds advanced or\nto be advanced by the State without the prior written authorization or approval\nof the division will be declared ineligible. The accounting entries reflecting\nthe division's letter of approval are described in Part 1646, Development\n\nPeriod Accounting. See also the definition of account 1610, Indeterminate\n\nExpenditures, in Part 1641. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1640-4.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
