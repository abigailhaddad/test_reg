  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 186.5 - Delivery to storage\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen apples in closed packages are delivered to a storage\nwarehouse for storage, such delivery is presumptive evidence that the apples\nare intended for sale. The packages of apples become subject to inspection and\nmust be properly branded. In the case of apples placed in storage for packing\nor processing later, the owner may file with the operator of the storage a\nstatement in writing, signed by the owner, describing the apples, indicating\nstorage lot numbers or other definite identification, stating the number of\npackages, and declaring that they are either to be used for processing or are\nto be repacked and properly branded before shipment. Said notice is to be\nplaced on file with the first delivery and amended with each subsequent\ndelivery to correspond at all times with the total number of packages stored. Such a statement will be regarded by the department as overcoming the\npresumption that the apples are intended for sale, provided that the statement\nis kept continuously available for examination by representatives of the\ndepartment, and that due notice is given to the department when the apples are\nrepacked and branded. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n186.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
