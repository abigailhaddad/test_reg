  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 177.6 - Conduct and scope of investigations\n\nState Regulations\n\nConsistent with agency policy, the ombudsman shall\ninvestigate those grievances and complaints which, in his/her opinion, warrant\ninvestigation. In determining whether to investigate a grievance or complaint, the ombudsman must make a judgment whether there is reasonable suspicion to\nbelieve that a legal right has been violated. Once the decision to investigate\na grievance or complaint has been made, the ombudsman shall seek to determine\nwhether the grievance or complaint is valid. In conducting his/her\ninvestigation, the ombudsman may speak to any person who may have information\nregarding the grievance or complaint. The purpose of the ombudsman's\ninvestigation shall be to alert the division to incidents which might impair\nthe rights of youth under the jurisdiction of the division, and to provide\nrecommendations for improvements in division policies and practices. The\nombudsman's role shall be that of an investigator of youth rights, youth\nadvocate and reporter. He/she shall promptly notify the facility or program\ndirector and the director of the office of the ombudsman, who shall in turn\nnotify the appropriate agency officials of any incident which indicates that a\nserious violation of rights has occurred which could be the basis for\ndisciplinary action and/or criminal prosecution against an employee or\nresident. The division, upon receipt of such notification from the ombudsman, shall review and determine the need for an independent investigation. The\nombudsman shall not have the authority to initiate a disciplinary proceeding or\nto assume the role of prosecutor. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n177.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
