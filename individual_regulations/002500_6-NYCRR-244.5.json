(3)\nCSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual\nnew unit set-aside allowances may be transferred to CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nAnnual units for no more than eight consecutive\ncontrol periods, starting with the latter of the 2017 control period or the\ncontrol period during which the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual unit\ncommenced, or is projected to commence, operation and ending with the control\nperiod preceding the first control period for which the CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nAnnual unit will receive an allocation pursuant to\nparagraph 244.3(b)(2) of this part. (4)\n\nThe designated representative of a CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nAnnual unit must submit a written request to the\ndepartment to reserve for the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual unit a\nnumber of CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual allowances in the relevant\nCSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual new unit set-aside account in an amount\nno greater than the number representing the unit's potential to emit. The\nreservation request must be submitted prior to January 1st of the control\nperiod to which the reservation request pertains. The department will not\nconsider any request for the reservation of CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual new unit set-aside allowances submitted prior to the issuance of all\npermits and authorizations by the department that are necessary for operation\nof the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual unit. The reservation request\nmust include information detailing the potential to emit of the CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nAnnual unit. (5)\n\nSubject to the number of CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nAnnual allowances allocated to each new unit\nset-aside account, following department approval of the request for reservation\nof CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual allowances, the department will\nreserve CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual allowances in the CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nAnnual new unit set-aside account before the start\nof the control period for which the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual\nunit will receive an allocation pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section in\nan amount no greater than the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual unit's\npotential to emit. (6)\n\nIf more than\none CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual unit requests the reservation of\nCSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual allowances and the number of requested\nallowances exceeds the allocation to the relevant CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual new unit set-aside account, the department will reserve\nCSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual allowances from the account for the\nunits in the order in which the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual units\nsubmitted approvable reservation requests. For the purposes of this paragraph, requests will be considered simultaneous if they are made in the same calendar\nquarter. Should approvable reservation requests in excess of the allocation to\nthe relevant CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual new unit set-aside account\nbe submitted in the same calendar quarter by different CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nAnnual units, the department will reserve CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nAnnual allowances for those units on a basis\nproportional to the number of CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual\nallowances requested by each CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual\nunit. (7)\n\nBy July 1st of each year, the department will submit a request to the Administrator, in a format\nprescribed by the Administrator, to transfer reserved CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nAnnual allowances to the compliance account of the\nCSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual source that includes the relevant CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nAnnual unit in an amount no greater than the number\nrepresenting the unit's potential to emit. (8)\n\nAfter the Administrator makes the\ndeductions for compliance under\n40 CFR\n97.424\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this\ntitle) for a control period, the department will determine whether any CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nAnnual allowances remain in the CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nAnnual new unit set-aside account for the control\nperiod. By the July 1st following the control period, the department will\ntransfer any remaining CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual allowances from\nthe CSAPR NO\nx\n\nAnnual new unit set-aside account to the\nEERET account. Allowances transferred to the EERET account will be available\nfor sale or other disposition in accordance with section\n244.6\nof this part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
