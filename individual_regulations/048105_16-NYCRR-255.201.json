  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.201 - Required capacity of pressure relieving and limiting stations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\npressure-relief or pressure-limiting station or group of stations installed in\na low pressure distribution system must have enough capacity, and must be set\nto operate, to ensure that the pressure may not cause the unsafe operation of\nany connected and properly adjusted gas utilization equipment. (b) Each pressure-relief or pressure-limiting\nstation or group of stations installed in pipelines other than low-pressure\ndistribution systems must have enough capacity, and must be set to operate to\nlimit the pressure according to the following paragraphs: (1)\n\nIf the maximum allowable operating\npressure is 60 psig (414 kPa) or more, the pressure may not exceed the maximum\nallowable operating pressure plus 10 percent, or the pressure that produces a\nhoop stress of 75 percent of SMYS, whichever is lower. (2)\n\nIf the maximum allowable operating\npressure is 12 psig (83 kPa) or more, but less than 60 psig (414 kPa), the\npressure may not exceed the maximum allowable operating pressure plus 6 psig\n(41.4 kPa). (3)\n\nIf the maximum\nallowable operating pressure is less than 12 psig (83 kPa), the pressure may\nnot exceed the maximum allowable operating pressure plus 50 percent. (c) When more than one\npressure-regulating or compressor station feeds into a pipeline, relief valves\nor other protective devices must be installed at each station to ensure that\nthe complete failure of the largest capacity regulator or compressor, or any\nsingle run of lesser capacity regulators or compressors in that station, will\nnot impose pressures on any part of the pipeline or distribution system in\nexcess of those for which it was designed, or against which it was protected, whichever is lower. (d) Relief\nvalves or other pressure-limiting devices must be installed at or near each\nregulator station in a low-pressure distribution system, with a capacity to\nlimit the maximum pressure in the main to two psig (14 kPa). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.201\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
