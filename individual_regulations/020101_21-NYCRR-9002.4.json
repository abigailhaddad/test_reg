The designated\npayment office will log the receipt date of each invoice, and send it to the\ndepartment unit within the authority that received the goods, property or\nservices from the contractor for review and verification of the contractor's\nperformance in accordance with the contract. Contractors with contracts which\nprovide for payment at specific dates or intervals shall also be required to\nprovide a proper invoice which certifies that the obligations required under\nsuch contract have been performed prior to such date(s) or during such\ninterval(s), and review and verification of the work of these contractors will\ntake place upon receipt of such proper invoice; payment shall be made in\naccordance with the terms of such contracts. (b) Prompt payment schedule. The schedule of\nthe time in which the authority will make prompt payment under a contract is as\nfollows: (1)\n\nFor invoices received on or\nbefore June 30, 1989, payment will be made by the authority within 45 calendar\ndays after receipt of a proper invoice. (2)\n\nFor invoices received on or after July 1, 1989, payment will be made by the authority within 30 calendar days, excluding\nlegal holidays, after receipt of a proper invoice. (3)\n\nFor contracts which provide for payment\nat one or more specific dates or intervals, payment will be made in accordance\nwith the terms of such contracts, but interest shall only be payable if payment\nis not made within the time provided in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this\nsubdivision. (4)\n\nThis schedule will\nnot apply in those instances where payment is being delayed by reason of any of\nthe exceptions listed in subdivision (e) of this section, or where the time in\nwhich to make payment is being tolled for any of the reasons listed in\nsubdivision (f) of this section, in which cases the time for payment shall be\nas there provided. (c) Interest computation. If the authority fails to make payment in accordance with\nthe prompt payment schedule set forth in subdivision (b) of this section, the\nauthority will pay interest to the affected contractor at the rate equal to\nthat set by the State Tax Commission for corporate taxes pursuant to section\n1096 (e)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (d) Funds available to pay\ninterest penalties. The authority will pay interest as provided herein with\nmonies available to the authority for operating and administrative expenses\npursuant to its approved budget. (e) Extension of payment time. Any of the following facts, conditions or situations\nare determined by the authority to be exceptions to the prompt payment schedule\nset forth in subdivision (b) of this section, and to justify extensions of the\ntime by which payment must be made (the amount of time of such extension being\nas established by the authority's treasurer consistent with this Part, with\nnotice provided to the contractor): (1)\nstatutory or contract provisions requiring an inspection period or an audit\nprior to payment; (2)\nthe absence\nof a State appropriation which is necessary to authorize payment; (3)\na requirement for Federal government\nexamination of a proper invoice prior to payment; (4)\nextraordinary delay between the time of\nthe provision of goods, property or services by a contractor and the receipt of\na proper invoice by the authority; (5)\nfailure by a contractor to submit\ndocuments required by the contract or reasonably required by the authority\nprior to payment; or\n(6)\nwhere time\nis taken in the processing of an invoice by the State Department of Taxation\nand Finance, the State Division of the Budget, the Office of the State\n\nComptroller, or any other entity external to the authority that is or may be\nrequired by statute, regulation or contract to approve or process authority\npayments. (f) Defects or\nimproprieties. (1)\n\nThe following facts or\nconditions toll the prompt payment schedule set forth in subdivision (b) of\nthis section: (i) a reasonable belief by the\nauthority in the existence of any defect(s), including any incompleteness or\nfailure of compliance with the terms of the contract, in or with respect to the\ngoods, property or services delivered; (ii)\na reasonable belief by the authority in\nthe existence of any defect(s) in the invoice; or\n(iii)\na reasonable belief by the authority in\nsuspected impropriety of any kind. (2)\n\nIn order to toll the prompt payment\nschedule without penalty, the authority has 15 calendar days after receipt of\nan invoice to send a contractor notification of such defects or improprieties. Authority notification shall be by letter to the contractor setting forth any\nsuch defect or impropriety in reasonable detail, sent to the address indicated\nfor notices under the contract or, if no such address is provided, sent to the\naddress set forth in the invoice; provided that, in the event that the\nauthority fails to so notify the contractor within such 15 days, the sole\neffect of such failure to so notify the contractor shall be that the number of\ndays allowed for payment shall be reduced by the number of days between such\n15th day and the date of the authority's transmitting such notification. In the\nevent that the authority fails to provide reasonable grounds for its contention\nthat any such defect or impropriety exists, the date by which contract payment\nshall be made shall be calculated from the date of receipt of an\ninvoice.
