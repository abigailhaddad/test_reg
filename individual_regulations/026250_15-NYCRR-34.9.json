  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 34.9 - Technical filing specifications\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Introduction. An insurance company or\nservicing agent shall submit notices required by this Part using commercial\ntranslator/mapping software in full accordance with the most current version of\nDMV's Motor Vehicle Liability Insurance Reporting (MVLIR) Implementation Guide, this Part and Part 32 of this Title and articles 6 and 8 of the Vehicle and\n\nTraffic Law. DMV's MVLIR is based on version 3050 of the national ANSI ASC X12\n811 transaction set. The department reserves the right to upgrade the version\nused for reporting motor vehicle liability insurance notices to version 4010 or\nhigher upon giving 180 days notice to insurers and servicing agents. (b) Form of notices (reporting media). Except\nas otherwise provided for in this Part, notices submitted by an insurance\ncompany or servicing agent shall be in the EDI format prescribed by technical\nfiling specifications of this Part and DMV's MVLIR implementation guide and\nmust be received by DMV's mailbox on its selected value added network\n(VAN). (c) Data compatibility. The\ninsurance industry (insurance companies, insurance agents and insurance\nbrokers) and the New York State automobile insurance plan (NYAIP) shall employ\nadministrative and operational procedures and computer processing, verification\nand database systems that properly capture, store, validate required data and\ntransmit notices to DMV that contain required policy data that is compatible\nwith the department's registration data. The insurance industry shall: (1)\nuse/verify paper and electronic source\ndocuments, including registrations, driver's licenses, title certificates, manufacturer's certificates of origin and so forth to obtain compatible\nregistrant and vehicle information; (2)\nobtain name and vehicle information from\nregistrations already in existence at the time of policy inception or\namendment; (3)\nfollow insurance ID\ncard issuance procedures set forth in Part 32 of this Title; and\n(4)\nutilize commercial VIN validation\nsoftware that validates the complete VIN. Electronic and manual proof of insurance notices submitted\nto DMV by an insurance company or servicing agent in the form of LOD, NBS and\nREI notices, required by this Part, must match DMV registration records. (d) Processing. Upon\nreceipt, notices will be processed through DMV's EDI translator and application\nprograms for the purpose of verification of EDI and DMV MVLIR format and\nreporting requirements by identifying missing or invalid data as well as\nnotices submitted for excluded registration classifications. Edit errors will\nresult in the exclusion of notices from DMV's matching application. Transactions passing EDI and application editing will be included in DMV's\ndaily electronic matching and electronic exceptions resolution processes. Resolved no-hit exceptions, unresolved no-hit exceptions and application edit\nerrors will be acknowledged via an EDI 811 return transaction. Hits will not be\nacknowledged via an EDI 811 return transaction but will be included on official\nDMV statistical reports and posted to DMV's insurance information database\nalong with resolved no-hit exceptions. Translator edit errors will be returned\nvia an EDI 997 error. A NBS notice shall be reprocessed (matching retried) on a\ndaily basis by DMV for a period not to exceed 45 days after such notice's\neffective date. A NBS notice resulting in a resolved no-hit exception during\nthis period will be returned to an insurance company or servicing agent the\nnext business day. A NBS notice unmatched after expiration of the reprocessing\nperiod will be returned to an insurance company or servicing agent as an\nunresolved no-hit exception the next business day. This facility is provided by\nDMV in recognition that a NBS notice may be submitted before a computerized\nregistration record has been created as a result of a vehicle's registration. Reprocessing avoids continual return and resubmission of unmatched NBS notices\nduring the period that a registrant may legally operate a vehicle using a paper\n45 day temporary registration issued by a licensed NYS motor vehicle\ndealer. (e) Performance reports. DMV shall produce official performance reports that detail and measure an\ninsurance company's performance in key measurement areas. An insurance company\nor servicing agent shall obtain official DMV weekly and periodic performance\nreports from a designated IIES web site using access security measures\nestablished by DMV during that period of time when reports are published on\nsuch site. Official DMV performance reports include the following: DMV\ninitiated verification transaction report, edit error report, filing report, late filing profile and matched resubmission report. Additional descriptive\ninformation on each official DMV performance report is provided in section\n34.2\nof this Part. (f) Definitions of key data elements. (1)\n\nAn insurance company or servicing agent\nshall submit data in full compliance with the definitions and specifications\ncontained in this Part including DMV's MVLIR implementation guide. (2)\n\nAdditional insured name. Please see\ninsured name. All additional insured names (both individuals and organizations)\nwho are registrants shall be submitted. Note: DMV's MVLIR implementation guide\ndetails additional insured name as optional because all polices do not have\nadditional insured names. (3)\n\nAdditional insured date of birth (DOB). The actual date of birth of an\nindividual additional named insured. The date element shall be in YYMMDD format\nand contain valid numeric characters. The century element shall contain valid\nnumeric characters that represent a valid century of birth for a living\nindividual. Date and century shall not be alpha, alpha/numeric or incomplete. No default values shall be submitted. (4)\n\nAdditional insured gender. The gender\n(sex) of an individual additional named insured. Gender shall be submitted as F\nfor female, M for male and U for unknown. U shall be submitted only if the\ngender is actually unknown and shall not be used as a default for expediency. No characters other than F, M or U shall be used. (5)\n\nCancellation effective date. The actual\ndate that insurance coverage was canceled or terminated (except for hire) or\nwill be canceled or terminated (for hire) for all vehicles on a policy or a\nvehicle deleted from a policy without replacement. Liability insurance coverage\nends at 12:01a.m. on the effective date of cancellation. For example, if an\ninsurance company notifies DMV of a cancellation with an effective date of\n\nNovember 15, 2000, our processing will reflect that the cancellation took\neffect at 12:01a.m. on November 15, 2000. Therefore, there is no insurance\ncoverage provided on November 15, 2000 or thereafter. Cancellation effective\ndate shall not represent an administrative, mailing, processing or other date\nprior to or subsequent to the actual effective date of the cancellation. Cancellation effective date shall correspond to the termination effective date\nin a termination notice provided directly to the policyholder by an insurance\ncompany. Cancellation effective date may be the termination date requested in\nwriting by the policyholder or the effective date of a superseding liability\ninsurance policy obtained by the policyholder. The date element shall be in\nYYMMDD format, contain valid numeric characters, represent a valid date for the\ntransaction and be complete without any modification.

The actual date that\nliability insurance coverage became effective (or will become effective- for\nhire) for a policy, a vehicle added to a policy or other activity defined in\nthis Part. Effective date is comprised of separate date and century elements. Effective date shall not represent an administrative, mailing, processing or\nother date prior to or subsequent to the actual effective date. If a registrant\nis obtaining superseding coverage in a timely manner, the effective date of the\nnew coverage shall coincide with the cancellation effective date of the old\ncoverage to preclude a lapse in coverage. Effective date shall be the date from\nDMV's mandatory verification (MVF) when an insurance company is responding to\nDMV with a no insurance (NIS) transaction. The effective date in a DMV\ninitiated mandatory verification (MVF) transaction shall represent the coverage\neffective date from paper proof of insurance, e.g., insurance ID card, the date\nof registration, or the date of accident or traffic ticket. The effective date\nin a DMV initiated negative verification (NVF) transaction shall be the batch\nprocessing date.

Proof of identity is\nrequired for an individual. Legal documentation, such as incorporation papers\nor a DBA filing with a county clerk is required for an organization. Accordingly, a liability insurance policy and insurance ID cards or insurance\ncertificates shall not be issued in a name or names not legally supported for\nregistration. (i) Individual or co-registrants\n(two individuals). Registration name shall be submitted, in the name element\norder of last name (surname), first name (given name) and middle name (or\ninitial).

A registration generally remains in the name of the\ndeceased, is transferred to a surviving spouse, or the vehicle is registered in\nthe name of the executor, executrix, administrator, etc. of the estate. Otherwise, ownership is transferred to a new owner who generally becomes the\nregistrant. The greatest percentage of matched notices will result from\nsubmitting the name of the deceased. (ii)\n\nOrganization. Registration name shall be\nsubmitted. If the organization is not yet a registrant, the name used must be\nacceptable for registration, e.g., supported by a certificate of incorporation, DBA filing with a county clerk, etc. Organization names include corporations, professional corporations, partnerships, limited liability partnerships, corporate DBAs, individual DBAs and so forth.

DMV did not allow registration in\nthe name of an individual DBA until February of 1997. An individual DBA was\nregistered with the last name entered first during calendar years 1997, 1998\nand 1999. Insured names submitted for the same policy can include JONES JOHN\n(individual) and JOHN JONES DBA JONES REMODELING (organization). In many cases\na vehicle is actually registered in an individual name, not an individual DBA\n(organization) name. Unacceptable organization name examples: JONES HARVEY TRUCKING (corporation with name\nreversed)\nCAPITAL DISTRICT RESTAURANT GROUP DBA GIMME PIZZA\n(corporate and DBA names included)\n(13)\n\nInsurer name.

Make of vehicle shall not contain fictitious or default\nvalues such as UNKN, N/A, OTHER, or AAAAA. (18)\n\nPrefix. The general rule is that name\nprefixes such as DR or MR shall not be submitted within the name data element. Rather, any prefixes shall be submitted as a separate data element in\naccordance with DMV MVLIR specifications.
