  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 975.7 - Statistical sampling provisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In order to ensure the submission of valid revenue passenger statistics in all\ninstances where the system submits \"estimated\" data, the STOA program will\nimpose, effective January 1, 1990, annual precision (10%) and confidence (95%)\nrequirements on any system's sampling and/or data collection technique used to\ncalculate estimated passenger data and any revenue passenger-related data. Thus, any system that does not submit actual revenue ridership data must be\nable to document that its annual passenger statistics submitted for STOA from\n\nApril 1990 on, will be in compliance with these annual confidence and precision\nlimits. (b) For demand responsive\nsystems, however, it is required that such operations document and present\n\"actual\" quarterly revenue passenger statistics. (c) Each public transportation system is\nrequired to categorize all riders into eligible revenue passengers (including\ncash fares, tokens and other pre-payment instruments that satisfy the\nper-passenger minimums specified in section\n975.2\n(d) ) and\ninto ineligible non-revenue passengers. It will be the responsibility of the\npublic transportation system to certify that its sampling technique and sample\nsize provide estimates of quarterly revenue passengers, such that when\nconsidered on an annual basis they satisfy the required levels of confidence\nand precision (95% and 10%, respectively). (d) Vehicle Mile Data - Each public\ntransportation system is required to calculate eligible revenue vehicle mile\ndata by employing one of the two following methods: (1)\ncompute total actual miles and adjust for\ndeadhead and other non-revenue miles, or\n(2)\nderive revenue vehicle mile portion of\ntotal miles from schedules and adjust for missing trips; and\n(3)\nfurthermore, the transit system must\ncertify and be able to demonstrate that there is a system in place to account\nfor missing trips and/or deadhead and other non-revenue mileages. The system\nmust also certify and be able to document that any standard mileages that are\npreassigned for individual routes reflect audited, actual mileages for such\nroutes accurate to the nearest one tenth of a mile. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n975.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
