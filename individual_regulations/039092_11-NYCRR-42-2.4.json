  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 42-2.4 - Rounding\n\nState Regulations\n\nMinimum nonforfeiture values may be rounded to the nearest dollar. If the requirement for a table of cash values appearing in the policy form is satisfied by using a rate per $1,000 of insurance then multiplying the rate per $1,000 times the face amount divided by 1,000 must result in a cash value that equals or exceeds the minimum nonforfeiture values. For example, a form provides cash values in dollars per $1,000 of face. If the actual minimum required cash value for a given class at a specific anniversary is $12.12 per $1,000 then the cash value of a $4,000 policy could be shown as $12 per thousand ($48.48 rounded to $48), but the cash value of a $5,000 policy could not be shown as $12 per thousand ($60.60 can be rounded to $61.00 but not to $60.00). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n42-2.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
