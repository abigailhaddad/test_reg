  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 162.5 - Bunched italian sprouting broccoli standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. New York State Seal of Quality\nbroccoli shall be bunched stalks of Italian sprouting broccoli. Each bunch\nshall be clean, fresh, have characteristic color, and be free from decay and\nfree from damage caused by overmaturity, discoloration of bud clusters or\nleaves, freezing, disease, insects, mechanical or other means. The bud clusters\nin each bunch shall be compact or fairly compact. Each bunch shall be neatly\nand fairly evenly cut off at the base and closely trimmed. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nDamage means any specific defect\ndescribed in this section, or an equally objectionable variation of any one of\nthese defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects, which\nmaterially detracts from the appearance, or the edible or marketing quality of\nthe bunch. The following specific defects shall be considered as damage: (i) Overmaturity. When the appearance of the\nbunch is slightly affected by the presence of open flower buds, or buds which\nare enlarged and on the verge of opening. (ii)\n\nDiscoloration of bud clusters. When the\nappearance of the bunch is materially affected by buds which have a noticeably\nyellowish, brownish or reddish cast in contrast to the desirable good green\ncolor. A bluish or purplish cast over the green is often characteristic of good\nbroccoli and shall not be considered as damage. (iii)\n\nDiscoloration of leaves. When the\nappearance of the bunch is materially affected by discolored leaves or parts of\nleaves. (iv)\n\nHollow stems. If the\nopening extends more than three inches up in the stem or when the opening is\nmore than slightly discolored or watersoaked on any stalk in the\nbunch. (v) Blighted buds. When the\naggregate affected area of dry, hard and yellowish brown bud clusters exceed a\ncircle one inch in diameter. (vi)\n\nInsects. When more than five live or dead insects are present. When more than\none live or dead worm is present. When bunches show evidence of insect or worm\nfeedings exceeding the aggregate area of a circle 5/8 inch in\ndiameter. (vii)\n\nStem texture. When\nstems or stalks have a definite woody texture affecting a portion more than one\ninch in length above the lowest point of trim. (2)\n\nSerious damage means any specific defect\ndescribed in this section, or an equally objectionable variation of any one of\nthese defects, which seriously detracts from the appearance of the edible or\nmarketing quality of the bunch. The following specific defects shall be\nconsidered as serious damage. (i) Discoloration of bud clusters when the buds have a decidedly yellowish, brownish or reddish cast which seriously detracts from the appearance of the\nbunch. A bluish or purplish cast over the green is often characteristic of good\nbroccoli and shall not be considered as serious damage. (ii)\n\nDiscoloration of leaves when the\nappearance of the bunch is seriously affected by discolored leaves or parts of\nthe leaves. (iii)\n\nBlighted buds\nwhen the aggregate area of the dry, hard and yellowish to brown bud clusters\nexceeds a circle 1 1/2 inches in diameter. (iv)\n\nInsects when more than 10 live or dead\ninsects are present. When more than two live or dead worms are present. When\nbunches show evidence of insect or worm feedings exceeding the aggregate area\nof the circle 7/8 inch in diameter. (v) Stem texture when stems or stalks have a\ndefinite woody texture affecting a portion more than three inches in length\nabove the lowest point of trim. (3)\n\nDiameter means the average measurement\nacross the bud clusters at the top of the bunch. (4)\n\nLength means the total length of the\nbunch measured from the base of the stem to the top of the bud\nclusters. (5)\n\nCompact means that\nthe individual buds in the bud cluster are generally small and tightly crowded\ntogether, and that the bud clusters on the stalk are generally close together\nand feel fairly firm and moderately resistant to pressure. (6)\n\nFairly compact means that the individual\nbuds and bud clusters on the stalk are generally close together so that the top\nof the clusters do not have a ragged appearance or feel very soft. (7)\n\nClosely trimmed means that not more than\na total of five percent, by weight, of the bunch consists of attached stems and\nleaves that are longer than the average length of the bunch, regardless of\npoint of attachment, or loose leaves and stems. (8)\n\nClean means bunches are practically free\nfrom dirt or other foreign matter. (9)\n\nFresh means broccoli has normal\nsucculence, brightness and firmness. (10)\n\nCharacteristic color means stalks shall\nbe green to dark green in color. It must be remembered that some varieties of\nbroccoli often have a purplish to blue color of the bud clusters, this shall be\nconsidered characteristic. (11)\n\nStalk means a portion of the broccoli plant including the stem, bud clusters\nand leaves. (12)\n\nBunch means stalks\nbound together to form a unit. A single stalk may be considered a bunch if it\nis approximately as large as other bunches in the lot. (13)\n\nFairly uniform means the diameter of the\nbunches within the carton do not vary more than three inches. Broccoli is\nconsidered to be neatly and fairly evenly cut off at the base, if the butt is\nsmoothly trimmed in a plane approximately parallel to the bottom of the\ncontainer when standing upright and the butt is not stringy or\nfrayed. (c) Size. (1)\n\nThe diameter of each bunch shall be as\nfollows: bunches packed 14 per carton, not less than six inches; bunches packed\n18 per carton, not less than five inches. (2)\n\nThe length of each bunch shall be not\nless than six inches or more than 81/2 inches. (3)\n\nBunches within each carton shall be\nfairly uniform. (d) Tolerances. In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and\nhandling, the following tolerances, determined by count, are provided as\nspecified. (1)\n\nFor defects. Not more than 10\npercent of the bunches in any lot may fail to meet the requirements of the\nspecifications, but not more than 1/2 of this amount, or five percent, shall be\nallowed for bunches which are seriously damaged, including therein not more\nthan one percent for bunches which are affected by decay. (2)\n\nFor size. Not more than 10 percent of the\nbunches in any lot may fail to meet the minimum size requirements of the\nspecifications. (3)\n\nFor\ncompactness. Seventy-five percent of the bunches in any lot must be compact, with the remainder fairly compact. Bunches not meeting the requirements of\nfairly compact shall be considered a defect and scored against the 10 percent\ntolerance for defects. (4)\n\nNot more\nthan five percent of the cartons in any lot shall fail to meet the requirements\nof fairly uniform. (5)\n\nNot more\nthan five percent of the cartons in any lot may fail to meet the packing\nrequirements. (e) Application of tolerances. The contents of individual cartons in the lot, based\non sample inspection, are subject to the following limitations: (1)\n\nFor a tolerance of 10 percent or more, individual cartons in any lot may contain not more than 1 1/2 times the\ntolerance specified. Provided, that the average for the entire lot is within\nthe tolerance specified. (2)\n\nFor a\ntolerance of less than 10 percent, individual cartons in any lot may contain\nnot more than double the tolerances specified. Provided, that at least one\nbunch which does not meet the requirements shall be allowed in any one carton. Provided further, that the averages for the entire lot are within the\ntolerances specified. (3)\n\nFor\ncompactness. Individual cartons shall contain at least 50 percent compact\nbunches with the remainder fairly compact (Application of tolerances as set\nforth in paragraph [1] of this subdivision shall apply to containers with\nbunches not meeting fairly compact). (f) Packing. Waxed cartons shall have 14 or\n18 bunches with a minimum of 10 pounds of pack ice. All cartons are subject to\napproval by the Department of Agriculture and Markets. Carton approval shall be\nbased upon the ability of the carton to maintain the quality standards and\nintegrity of the product. (g) Markings. Containers of broccoli packaged and offered for sale under the Seal\nof Quality program shall have affixed the official seal designation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
