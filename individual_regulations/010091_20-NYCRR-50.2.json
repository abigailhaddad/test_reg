  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 50.2 - When a taxable event is deemed to occur within the State of New York\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe fact that two or more of the taxable events described\nin article 12 of the Tax Law and in section\n50.1\nof this\n\nPart occur within the State of New York with respect to a single transaction\ndoes not mean that more than one tax is imposed; only one tax is payable with\nrespect to any one transaction. Thus, if a sale, delivery of the certificates\nand record transfer to the name of the purchaser are all made within the State, only one tax is payable. However, if any one of these taxable events occurs\nwithin the State with reference to any transaction, it is subject to tax\nregardless of where the others occurred. Thus, a transfer of record ownership\non the books of the corporation within the State is subject to tax, even though\nthe sale and delivery of the certificates were made outside the State. The same\nis true of a sale or agreement to sell, or a delivery of certificates made\nwithin the State, although all other events relating to the same transaction\noccurred outside of the State. However, Federal Law preempts the imposition of\nthe tax on a transfer of beneficial or record ownership on the books of a\ncorporation within the State effected through the facilities of a registered\nclearing agency or registered transfer agent if such tax is imposed solely\nbecause the facilities of such registered clearing agency or registered\ntransfer agent are physically located within the State (see  15 U.S.C.A. section\n78bb\n). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n50.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
