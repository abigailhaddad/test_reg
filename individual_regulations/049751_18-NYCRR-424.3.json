Tit. 18 § 424.3 - Updating registry information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When the adoption study is completed, the\nregistering agency shall either update the registry to indicate that the study\nhas resulted in the applicant being approved, or shall remove the applicant's\nname from the registry if the applicant was rejected or the adoption study was\ndiscontinued. (b) As soon as a\nregistering agency becomes aware that the circumstances or preferences of an\napplicant have changed and information contained in the registry is inaccurate, the agency shall provide the registry with corrected information.
