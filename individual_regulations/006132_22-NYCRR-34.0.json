  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 34.0 - Court facilities\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn the exercise of responsibility for supervision of the\nadministration and operation of the Unified Court System, the Chief\n\nAdministrator of the Courts shall encourage, whenever possible and insofar as\npracticable, compliance with the guidelines for New York State court facilities\nset forth below. GUIDELINES FOR NEW YORK STATE COURT FACILITIES\nGUIDELINE I: SAFETY\nI.1: Safety: Court\nfacilities should have structural design, building materials, methods of\nconstruction and fire rating as required by local or state building codes that\nare applicable in the locality. Court facilities should have fire alarms, fire\nextinguisher systems, means of egress and emergency exits as required by\napplicable building and fire codes. The use of court facilities should conform, to the extent\nrequired, to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Standards of the\nU.S. Department of Labor for public buildings. I.2: Emergency Planning and\n\nEvacuation Procedures: Court facilities should have established\nprocedures for the evacuation of facilities in case of fire or bomb threats, a\nsystem of communication in case of an emergency and the appointment of wardens\nto conduct fire drills at regular intervals. In addition, there should be\nsafety officers to assure that required safety measures are established and\nfollowed at all times. A multicourt facility should have one safety officer\nwith responsibility for the entire facility. GUIDELINE II: ACCESS FOR THE HANDICAPPED\nCourt facilities should be accessible to the physically\nhandicapped as required by Article 15 of the State's Executive Law and accepted\narchitectural standards. GUIDELINE III: ENVIRONMENT\n*\nIII.1: Overall Appearance: Court facilities should have an overall appearance of dignity and efficiency. The appearance of court facilities affects the attitude\nof litigants, attorneys, the public and court employees. Therefore, court\nfacilities should be continuously well maintained. III.2: Adequate Facilities and\n\nAreas: Court facilities should provide the required number of\ncourtrooms, chambers, jury deliberation rooms, attorney/client conference\nrooms, clerical and other offices of adequate size as set forth below in these\nguidelines. An inadequate number of facilities delays the administration of\njustice. III.3: Heating, Cooling and Humidity: Design should emphasize energy conservation. Court facilities should follow the standards set by the American Society of\n\nHeating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). III.4: Ventilation: A fresh, contaminant-free air supply should be provided. ASHRAE standards should be\nfollowed. III.5: Lighting: Court facilities should have adequate lighting\nlevels that comply with the standards set by the Illuminating Engineering\n\nSociety. Consideration should be given to energy conservation. III.6: Color Scheme and\n\nContrast: The color scheme should be sober and dignified, the colors\neasy to maintain. The following level of color contrast is suggested: * Courtrooms.. Low contrast................................................................................................................... * Offices, jury rooms, conference rooms, chambers.. Medium contrast............................................. * Public lobbies, conference rooms, storage areas.. Heavy contrast................................................... III.7: Acoustics: Court facilities should provide a comfortable acoustical environment suitable\nfor public trials, hearings, office work and research. There should be no vibration noise due to mechanical\nsystems (heating, air-conditioning, elevators, plumbing, creaky staircases, doors, windows and mechanical equipment). Jury deliberation rooms and family court hearing rooms\n(courtrooms) should be soundproof. Courtrooms should be free from outside noise disturbance\nand should be so constructed as to assure that all the participants in the well\narea are able to hear the proceedings. Sound amplification may be necessary in large courtrooms, jury assembly areas, and large family court waiting rooms. III.8: Vision and\n\nSightlines: In courtrooms, every participant in the well area should\nhave a clear and adequate view of all other participants. Detention areas and travel paths for incarcerated persons\nshould provide clear and maximum vision for easy supervision of\ndetainees. III.9: Confidentiality: Functions which require a considerable degree\nof confidentiality--such as jury deliberation; attorney/client conferences; attorney/defendant interviews; conferences with judges, clerks and probation\nofficers; and adoption proceedings--should be housed in private\nrooms. III.10: Cleaning and\n\nMaintenance: Court facilities should be clean and hygienic. Floor, wall, ceiling, door and window components should be devoid of deterioration and\nin working condition. Electrical, plumbing, heating and cooling systems should\nbe maintained in an operating condition. GUIDELINE IV: SIGNS AND PUBLIC INFORMATION\nIV.1: Exterior of the\n\nBuilding: The building should clearly be designated as a courthouse. If there are one or more courtrooms within a building housing other functions, it is particularly important that the existence of these courtrooms is made\nclear in a place easily seen by the public. IV.2: Directory: Prominently\ndisplayed just within the main doors should be a building directory, bilingual\nwhere appropriate. There should be a listing of the location of courtrooms, court-related services, and ancillary agencies. If the courthouse functions are\nspread among a number of buildings, the courtroom services and the addresses of\n(and directions to) the other buildings should be posted. IV.3: Door and Wall Signs: Signs should be posted at the door to each courtroom clearly identifying that\npart. In addition, directional wall signs, bilingual where appropriate, should\nbe used in buildings where long corridors or confusing layouts indicate they\nwould be useful. IV.4: Information Service: Where possible, there should be\ninformation desks strategically placed in public areas of the courthouse and\nstaffed where necessary by bilingual personnel to direct defendants and their\nfriends and relatives, witnesses, jurors, and spectators to their destinations. Where personnel are not available to establish such a\nservice, consideration should be given to employing well-trained citizen\nvolunteers. If such a service is not established, there should be an\noffice, such as that of the Court Clerk, designated as the place for the public\nto receive information and have their questions answered. Such public\ninformation offices should be clearly marked as such, and should be listed in\nthe directory. IV.5: Posting of Calendars: Copies of all daily part calendars in\nthat courthouse should be posted at a central location, and each courtroom\nshould have that room's calendar posted immediately outside. GUIDELINE V: DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR PROPOSED\nCOURTHOUSES\nV.1: When to Build\na New Courthouse: Building a new courthouse should be considered when: A. The existing structure needs replacement\nbecause of structural and other deterioration which would require more\nfinancing to remedy than would be needed for a new courthouse. B. The existing needs for court facilities\nfar exceed those that can be accommodated in the existing structure even with\nextensive renovation. C. Expansion\nof the existing structure to accommodate present and projected future needs\ncannot be accomplished by building an addition to the existing\nstructure. D. The space and\nfacility needs of the courts in conjunction with the needs of other\ngovernmental agencies would be best met by building a new structure. E. Where court facilities are substantially\nlocated in leased spaces and where it would be more cost-effective to house\nthem in a new publicly-owned structure. F. Where the historic landmark status or the\nstructure prohibits suitable renovations of the existing courthouse. V.2: Recycling of Existing\n\nStructures: New Court facilities may be created by renovating existing\nstructures, such as schools, commercial structures, warehouses or hospitals, as\nlong as the existing structure allows functional layout and design of court\nfacilities with appropriate internal and external symbolism and aesthetic\nqualities appropriate for a courthouse. V.3: Long-Term Court Needs: New court facilities should be built to accommodate current and projected needs\nover the period of the expected life of the new structure. The space and\nfacility needs should be based, wherever possible, on projection of workload, the number of people required to carry out the workload and the space required\nto house these people. V.4: Multipurpose Use, Time-Sharing and Flexibility: The\ntranslation of projected space and facility needs into a building program\nshould take into account multiple use of facilities, time-sharing of\nfacilities, and inbuilt flexibility of use of spaces. A. The total number of large courtrooms\nshould be based on the absolute number of full-time, year-round requirements\nfor court parts that have a need for a large public seating capacity (between\n100-120). B. The number of small\ncourtrooms should be based on the total projected needs of all the courts to be\nhoused in the building. No courtroom should be so small that it cannot be\nconverted to properly accommodate a 16-person jury box in its well\narea. C. Courtrooms should be so\nlocated on the floor as to allow separate access for incarcerated persons to\nall the courtrooms, if so required, in the future. D. Where judges' chambers are located on the\nsame floor in close proximity to the courtrooms, separate robing and conference\nrooms adjacent to the courtrooms are not required. E. The number of jury deliberation rooms to\nbe provided should be based on the current and projected future jury trial rate\nwithin the jurisdiction, but that number should not be less than the jury trial\nrate throughout the State. One jury deliberation room for each courtroom may\nnot be required. F. The number of\nattorney/client conference rooms, waiting rooms, and alternate jurors waiting\nrooms should be based on the principle of shared use of rooms. G. The holding facilities for incarcerated\npersons adjacent to courtrooms should allow the separation of males and\nfemales. H. Holding facilities for\nincarcerated persons adjacent to courtrooms should provide for at least one\nsecure attorney/defendant interview room. I. Large multi-courtroom facilities proposed\nfor construction or major renovation should take into account, to the extent\nfeasible, the need for attorneys' waiting rooms, accessible law libraries, public waiting areas, public address systems in public areas, jurors' areas, and designated eating areas for cafeteria facilities. V.5: Transportation/Accessibility: The courthouse site should be\nconvenient to transportation of the public, attorneys and incarcerated\npersons. V.6: Proximity to\n\nCourt-Related Agencies: The courthouse site should be in close\nproximity to other related agency locations such as District Attorney's\noffices, probation offices and County Clerks' offices. V.7: Separate Building\n\nBlocks: Consideration should be given to building two separate blocks\n- one for courtrooms and ancillary spaces, which require higher ceilings, and\nthe other to accommodate office-type functions with lower ceilings. If\nappropriately connected to each other, these could lend themselves to the\ndesign and installation of cost-effective systems for heating, cooling, security and maintenance, at the same time providing vertical expansion in the\nfuture, if required. V.8: Site Layout, Parking and Landscaping: The site layout should, where feasible, take into account parking needs of court users. Consideration\nshould be given to the security of the parking areas and the separate entrances\nto the courthouse. The site layout should provide for aesthetically planned, but easy to maintain, grounds and landscape of the surrounding area. V.9: Character of Building Design and\n\nSymbolism: The new courthouse design should project the traditional\nvalues of symbolism and retain the character of the area by using appropriate\nmaterials and fenestration. V.10: Placement of Related Functions: Within the building, the\nfunctions that require heavy public access, such as clerks' offices and jury\nassembly area, should be placed on the main and lower floors to minimize the\nuse of elevators, to allow closing off of the upper floors when not in use, and\nto allow zoning of the heating and cooling systems which can be shut off when\nthe other floors are not in use. By providing clerical space for all courts in\nthe structure on the same or adjacent floors, greater flexibility should be\nachieved in the allocation of space for clerical functions of different courts. Space can be saved by combining public areas for clerks' offices and\nphotocopying, mail, supplies and general storage areas of all courts. Space can\nalso be saved by allowing flexible use of secondary spaces for record storage\nby all courts. V.11: Use of\n\nBuilding Components Offering Flexibility: The design of building\ncomponents such as nonload-bearing partitions, doors, electrical fixtures, ceiling and floor finishes into integrated systems should allow flexibility in\nrearranging spaces. V.12: Choice of Building Materials: Building materials should be\nchosen for cost-effective maintenance, resistance to vandalism, acoustical\nqualities and safety. V.13: Separate Circulation Patterns: The layout should provide for a\nseparate pattern of circulation of judges, jurors, incarcerated persons and the\npublic. Spaces and facilities should be appropriately grouped together as\nsecure, private, semi- private and public areas. The layout should also be readily understandable to users\nunfamiliar with the facility. This should minimize the need for signs and avoid\nintrusion of the public into private areas. GUIDELINE VI: DESIGN GUIDELINES FOR SECURITY\nVI.1: Entrances: The\nentrances to the structure should be kept to a minimum. Separate entrances may\nbe necessary for the public, judges, staff, incarcerated persons and\ncourt-related agencies. However, the entrances for judges and staff can be\nprovided with key or card access to minimize security staffing needs. VI.2: Visibility: The plan\nand design should provide public corridors and spaces with uninterrupted\nvisibility. VI.3: Layout\nand Design: Layout and Design. The layout should be devised so that\nthere are three separate patterns of circulation: the first for judges, impanelled jurors and the court staff; the second for incarcerated persons; and the third for the public. Such circulation should limit the crossing of\npaths of these separate groups in order to minimize conflicts and to provide a\ndegree of privacy for judges and jurors\n\nThe courthouse design and layout should delineate public, semi-private, private and secure areas. Private areas would include such areas\nas judges' chambers or robing rooms, impanelled or sequestered jurors' areas, jury deliberation rooms and secure areas. The semi-private areas would include\nthe clerical offices. The public areas would include such areas as courtrooms, jury assembly areas, public lobbies, corridors and public restrooms. In the Family Court, all areas except the public lobbies, waiting rooms, public restrooms and public areas of the clerk's office should\nbe delineated as private areas to insure confidentiality of proceedings and\nrecords. VI.4: Staircases: Staircases should be so constructed as to prevent\nunauthorized access to secure areas on other floors. VI.5: Zoned Areas: The\ncourthouse design and layout should allow for the locking off of entire areas\nor floors when not in use. VI.6: Doors and Windows: The design of windows and doors should\ndeter access without compromising aesthetic, natural light and view\nconsiderations. The use of better components at somewhat higher initial cost\nshould be considered in order to provide better security than afforded by\ntraditional windows, doors, locks and keys. The use of impact-resistant glass\nor plastic material should be considered in strategic locations. VI.7: Lighting and Signs: There should be proper and adequate lighting at strategic locations. VI.8: Comprehensive Design\n\nApproach: When a group of structures is being designed, or a new\nstructure is being added to a group of existing buildings, the layout should\nconsider the security needs of all the structures as a group to eliminate the\nneed for separate security forces and electronic surveillance systems for each\nstructure. GUIDELINE VII: COURTROOM\nVII.1: Courtroom - General: The courtroom is\none of the most complex design problems of any courthouse, as well as its focal\npoint. Although there are only four (4) basic types of courtrooms-non-jury, civil, criminal and appellate-a large variety of court-room layouts are used. Hearing rooms are less formal courtrooms. All public courtrooms should have two major functional\nareas: i)\n\nThe well area should provide\nfor the active participants in the judicial proceeding, and\nii)\n\nThe public area should provide seating\nfor jurors to be empanelled, attorneys waiting for their cases and the public. The well area and the public area should be divided by a\n3-foot high rail with gates or openings at appropriate places. The public area should be large enough to accommodate\njurors to be empanelled, the attorneys waiting for their cases and the public. In jury trial courtrooms the public seating capacity should not be less than\n20. All courtrooms require a minimum of two and a maximum of\nfour entry/exit points. In a jury courtroom, where possible, an entry/exit\npoint should be provided that allows jurors to avoid mixing with the public. Juries should also be seated at an appropriate distance from the public rail in\ncourtrooms. The judge should have separate direct access to the bench. The\npublic and attorneys should also have an entry/ exit point that leads through\nor by a public seating area. In criminal courtrooms, where possible, a separate\nentry/exit point should be provided for incarcerated persons away from the\nbench and the jury box. Newly constructed or renovated courtrooms in\njurisdictions which may wish to hold criminal and civil jury trials in the same\ncourtroom should provide sufficient space in the well area to accommodate a\n16-person jury box to handle either criminal or civil cases. (See also\nguideline V.4 B above.)\n\nEvery courtroom should also allow the participants and\npublic to hear all proceedings clearly in normal conversation. Microphones\nshould be used where necessary. (See separate Task Force report on the use of\nmicrophones in courtrooms.) The materials used in the courtroom should not\nproduce excessive reverberation or echo. The materials and construction methods\nused should prevent disruption of court proceedings by outside noise. Where\npossible, vestibule should be provided at the public entrance to the courtroom\nor the doors should be soundproof. In existing courtrooms where audibility is\npoor, microphones should be used. Lighting should be adequate for reading on\nthe work surfaces and for viewing exhibits without producing glare or\nheat. The courtroom should have an assigned space for the\nviewing of exhibits. An exhibit board may be included as an integral part of\nthe courtroom design. If portable stands are to be used, storage space should\nbe provided in an adjacent area, but not necessarily in the courtroom. Coat\nclosets for the public should not be located within the courtroom. Every\ncourtroom should have a working wall clock on the opposite side of the judge's\nbench. Where required, adequate electrical outlets and wiring\nshould be provided for the use of audio tapes in evidence, for electronic case\nprocessing equipment, for security equipment and for the use of cameras in\ncourtrooms. The basic courtroom design need not be radically changed to\naccommodate the use of this equipment because the advances in technology are\nexpected to make this equipment unobtrusive. VII.2: Non-Jury, Public\n\nCourtroom\n(Minimum 600 square feet): The least complicated courtroom\ntype is the non-jury courtroom. Its basis components and requirements are: - A minimum well area of 24 feet depth and 20 feet\nwidth\n- A judge's bench\nseparate exit/entrance\n8' x 7' minimum work area raised 12\" or 18\" above floor\nlevel\na shielded working desk 8' x 2'\nability to hear and see all court participants\nability to be heard and seen in all parts of the\ncourtroom\na microphone\nadequate overhead lighting\nif local conditions require, an emergency alarm audible\nin the court security office\n- A witness stand\nraised 6\" or 12\" above floor level\nvisible to the bench, attorneys and court reporter\naudible throughout the courtroom\na rail and shelf\na microphone\na 3' x 5' minimum area, including circulation\nspace\n- A court reporter station\nadjacent to the witness stand\nability to observe witness, judge and attorneys\nability to hear every word spoken on record\nlockable drawer for storage, if required\nlighting similar to judge's\na 3' x 4' work space\n- A clerk's station\nlocation next to judge's bench\nshielded working desk\nlockable drawers\na 5' x 6' area\n- Litigants' tables\ntwo separate 6' x 3' tables with at least 3 seats for\neach table so located as to allow private conversations\neasy access to the judge's bench and witness stand\nability to be heard at bench when speaking\nconversationally\nlighting similar to judge's bench\nclear view of court proceedings\n- Spectator seating\nseparated by rail from well area\nclear view of court proceedings\n8-12 square feet per person\nVII.3: Civil Jury Trial\n\nCourtroom\n(Minimum 1200 square feet): Civil courtrooms have components\nand requirements similar to those in the non-jury courtrooms, with the need for\nthe following spaces as well: - A minimum well area of 24 feet depth and 30 feet\nwidth\n- Seven-person jury box, requiring\nseating for six jurors and one alternate in one or two\nrows, using comfortable arm swivel chairs in 42 * 22 minimum space per\njuror\none step between seat rows\nability to clearly see and hear witnesses, judge and\nattorneys\nrail and display shelf with adequate lighting\nlocation of the rail at least three feet from nearest\nattorney table and the rail separating the spectator area and the public\na footrest may be included\nexit/entry outside spectator area\nVII.4: Criminal Jury Trial\n\nCourtroom\n(Minimum 1600 square feet): Criminal courtrooms use these\nadditional components and requirements in addition to those listed above: - Fourteen (instead of seven) person jury box with\ncapacity to add additional jurors\nseating for twelve jurors and two to four alternates in\ntwo or three rows, using comfortable arm swivel chairs in 4' x 2' minimum per\njuror\nVII.5: Hearing Rooms: (Minimum 300 square feet): Hearing rooms are\nless formal courtrooms. They may have a judge's bench and a witness stand. Large hearing rooms for civil proceedings may range in size from 900 to 1200\nsquare feet, depending upon the need for space for attorneys and public waiting\nfor their cases. They may also be used for sentencing in bail or parole cases\nif secure access to detention areas is available to transport defendents to\ncustody after sentencing. VII.5a: Hearing Rooms in Family Court\n(600-900 square feet): Family\ncourt hearing rooms should have a minimum of 600 square feet in area. The trend\ntowards increased representation and opening of the proceedings to authorized\nobservers may need an area up to 900 square feet. The hearing rooms should be\nso constructed as to assure the confidentiality of the proceedings both as to\nsound and vision. The layout and design should satisfy local procedures and\ndegree of formality. Where feasible, separate access and circulation should be\nprovided for persons in custody. VII.5b: Hearing Rooms for Other Civil\n\nProceedings\n(Minimum 300 square feet): These should not be less than\n300 square feet in area. The types of courtrooms used in the New York State court\nsystem and their minimum square feet requirements are listed in Table 1 on the\nnext page.

Smaller courtrooms with original or unusual\ndesign may be satisfactory and adequate for local needs. 2\n\nLarger courtroom may be needed where volume\nof cases and the number of spectators are greater. 3\n\nFor 4 alternate jurors, 2 additional chairs\ncould be placed on the side or in front of the jury box. GUIDELINE VIII: COURTROOM ANCILLARY FACILITIES\nVIII.1: Robing Room (Minimum 200 square\nfeet): If the judge' s chambers are located away from the courtrooms, robing\nrooms should be provided adjacent thereto. Direct access from the robing room\nto the bench in the courtroom should be provided. The robing rooms should have\na table and chairs where the judge can hold conference with attorneys and\nparties. A robing room should also have a restroom or private access to judges'\nrestroom. VIII.2: Jury\n\nDeliberation Rooms: Six-Person Jury Deliberation Room\n(Minimum 200\nsquare feet); Twelve-Person Deliberation Room\n(Minimum 325\nsquare feet): The jury deliberation room should be adjacent to courtrooms with\naccess through non-public corridors. It should not be accessible to the public\nand should be so planned as to allow use of the courtrooms for other matters\nwhile the jury is deliberating. It should be so constructed as to ensure\nconfidentiality and should include: a coat closet\na minimum of one restroom\nproper ventilation\na table large enough to accommodate all jurors\ncomfortable chairs\nalarm buzzer to call guard\nprivacy should be assured both as to vision and\nsound\nVIII.3: Attorney/Client Conference Room, Witness Waiting Room, Alternate Juror\n\nWaiting Room\n(Minimum 100 square feet - a somewhat large size is\nrecommended to allow flexibility in use): An adequate number of rooms should be\nprovided on each courtroom floor, adjacent to courtrooms and accessible from\npublic waiting areas or from the courtrooms. The rooms should provide\nconvenient access to a telephone. They should be located and furnished to allow\nthem to be also used in other ways. Note: In larger, high volume\ncourthouses, it may be desirable or feasible to provide for attorneys' waiting\nrooms, public address systems in public areas, and additional conveniently\nlocated telephones. It is also desirable to take into account, to the extent\nfeasible, the particular needs of defense and prosecution attorneys and court\nrelated agencies in busy courthouses handling criminal (or juvenile)\nmatters. VIII.4: Holding Facilities For Incarcerated Persons Adjacent To\n\nCourtroom\n(Minimum 20 square feet per person, 80 square feet per\ncell): Courtrooms planned for criminal proceedings should have adjacent holding\nfacilities for incarcerated persons planned to allow for separate holding of\nmales and females with adequate privacy. Where feasible, the access to the\ncourtroom should be located away from the bench and the jury box. Access to the\ncentral holding area in the courthouse or to the incarcerated persons receiving\narea of the building should be by secure elevators. Adequate space for the\nguards should be located so as to allow easy supervision of the incarcerated\npersons. Holding facilities for incarcerated persons should be\nprovided with a secure alternative means of egress, such as separate\nstaircases, in case of fire. The building materials and methods of construction\nshould comply with appropriate provisions of the New York State Commission of\n\nCorrection Planning and Design Guidelines for Construction Renovation Programs. Plans for new holding areas are required to be filed with the Commission for\napproval prior to commencement of construction (Correction Law, section\n45[10]). VIII.5: Secure Attorney/Incarcerated Persons Interview Room\n(Minimum\n50 square feet): Holding facilities for incarcerated persons next to courtrooms\nas well as any court supervised central holding facility (if any) in the\ncourthouse should provide secure interview rooms for attorneys to confer with\ntheir clients. For busy arraignment courtrooms large holding areas may be\nnecessary and should provide an adequate number of secure interview rooms. The\ninterview rooms should provide for visual surveillance by security personnel\nand should be so constructed that the conversation between the attorney and his\nclient is private. VIII.6: Public Waiting Areas Adjacent to Courtroom\n(Minimum 12 square\nfeet per person): Adequate public waiting areas should be provided adjacent to\ncourtrooms with easy access to public restrooms and telephones. These areas\nshould be easy to maintain and should have such ashtrays and refuse receptacles\nas are necessary. The courtroom number, name of presiding judge, display of\ncase calendars and emergency exit signs should be clearly visible. Where court\nprocedures prevent wearing of hats and coats in the courtroom, coat racks\nshould be provided. In\n\nFamily Courts\nseparate waiting rooms\nfor juveniles and adults are mandatory. VIII.7: Examination Before Trial\n\nRoom\n(Minimum 200 square feet): It is desirable to include an adequate\nnumber of Examination Before Trial (EBT) rooms which are accessible from the\npublic area but which can be supervised by the court clerk.

In either\ncase, judge's chambers should be private with as convenient an access to the\ncourtroom as is reasonably possible. - The judge's chambers should have: a private office and working area for the judge\na private restroom or access to a private judges'\nrestroom\nspace in the office or in an adjacent conference\narea\nimmediate access to the secretary and any law\nclerk\nprivacy both as to sound and vision\nIX.2: Judge's Secretary's\n\nOffice/Reception\n(Minimum 200 square feet): Located at the public\naccess to the chambers, this office should provide waiting space for visitors\nand work/storage space for the judge's secretary. IX.3: Law Clerk's Office\n(Minimum 150 square feet): The judge's law clerk should have a private office\nwith work area and shelving for a working law library. The law clerk should\nhave easy access to the judge. IX.4: Central Reception Area\n(200-300 square feet): In larger courthouses, if judges' chambers are grouped\ntogether on a separate floor or in a separate area, a central reception area\nshould be provided to screen and announce the visitors. Where necessary, security personnel should be present in such an area. IX.5: Judges' Conference\n\nRoom\n(Minimum 20 square feet per person): In larger courthouses, a\nroom may be provided for the judges for conferences and use as a lunchroom.
