  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-3.11 - Insurance ledger\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll transactions relating to account 1211, Prepaid\n\nInsurance, and account 1212, Anticipated Returnable Premiums, shall be recorded\nin an insurance ledger. The insurance ledger shall not only serve as a\nsystematic record of all essential details relating to insurance coverage as\nevidenced by insurance policies, but also shall serve as a subsidiary ledger\nsupporting and controlled by the aforesaid general ledger prepaid insurance\naccounts and as a medium for the accumulation of the quarterly charges\nresulting from the straightline distribution of the premiums charged to account\n1211 over the lives of the policies. The charges accumulated for the respective\nquarters are then distributed to the various cost and expense accounts at the\nend of each quarter by means of a journal voucher. Stock forms of insurance\nledgers having a limited number of columns for the monthly distribution are\ngenerally available. Flysheets may be used for additional months or new forms\nmay be established each year periodically as required. Regardless of the form\nused, the insurance ledger shall show the kind of insurance, the name of the\ninsurer and broker, the policy number, description of coverage, amount and\nextent of coverage, effective date of the policy, the expiration date, the\npremium paid, the anticipated return premium, if any, the amount to be charged\nquarterly to development cost or operating expense, and the numbers and dates\nof the vouchers supporting the entries. A specimen form of insurance ledger\nreflecting these requirements is shown as Exhibit 18 of Appendix S-8. By a\nproper use of columns (10), (11), (13), and (14) to record the periodic\nwrite-offs, return premiums received, adjustments in return premiums and\npremium requirements, etc., column (2) being used for an explanation of the\ntransaction, it is apparent that the totals of columns (13) and (14) will\nalways agree with the balances of account 1212, Anticipated Returnable\n\nPremiums, and account 1211, Prepaid Insurance, the general ledger controls, respectively. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-3.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
