Tit. 18 § 417.11 - Health and infection control\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Child enrollment requirements for\nchildren not enrolled in kindergarten or a higher grade. (1)\n\nNo child may be accepted for care in a\nchild care program unless the program has been furnished with a written\nstatement signed by a health care provider verifying that the child is able to\nparticipate in child care and currently appears to be free from contagious or\ncommunicable diseases. A child's medical statement must have been completed\nwithin the 12 months preceding the date of enrollment. (2)\n\nThe written medical statement from the\nhealth care provider must also state whether the child is a child with special\nhealth care needs and, if so, what special provisions, if any, will be\nnecessary in order for the child to participate in child day care. When the\nwritten statement from the health care provider advises the day care program\nthat the child being enrolled is a child with special health care needs, the\nday care program must work together with the parent and the child's health care\nprovider to develop a reasonable health care plan for the child while the child\nis in the child day care program. The health care plan for the child must also\naddress how the day care program will obtain or develop any additional\ncompetencies that the caregivers will need to have in order to carry out the\nhealth care plan for the child. (3)\n\nThe program must keep documentation of immunizations the child has received to\ndate, in accordance with New York Public Health Law. (4)\nA program may admit any child not yet\nimmunized provided the child's immunizations are in process and the parent\ngives the program specific appointment dates for required immunizations in\naccordance with the requirements of New York Public Health Law. (5)\n[\nReserved\n]. (6)\n\nAny child who is missing one or more of\nthe required immunizations may be admitted if a physician licensed to practice\nmedicine in New York State furnishes the program with a signed, completed\nmedical exemption form issued by the New York State Department of Health or New\n\nYork City Department of Education. The medical exemption must be reissued\nannually. (7)\n\nWith the exception of\nchildren meeting the criteria of paragraph (6) of this subdivision children\nenrolled in child day care must remain current with their immunizations in\naccordance with the current schedule for required immunizations established in\nthe New York Public Health Law. (8)\n\nThe caregivers' children receiving care in the home must meet the health and\nimmunization requirements of this subdivision. (9)\n\nThe program must try to obtain a copy of\na lead screening certificate for each child under the age of six years. If the\nparent does not have one, the program may not exclude the child from child day\ncare, but must give the parent information on lead poisoning and prevention, and refer the parent to the child's health care provider or the local health\ndepartment for a lead blood screening test. (b) Provider, assistant, substitute, and household member health requirements. (1)\n\nThe provider, assistant(s), and\nsubstitute(s), must each submit a medical statement on forms furnished by the\noffice or an approved equivalent from a health care provider: (i) at the time of initial family day care\napplication; (ii)\nbefore such\nperson has any involvement in child care work. (2)\n\nThereafter a medical statement will be\nrequired when an event or condition reasonably calls into question a\ncaregiver's ability to provide safe and suitable child care. (3)\n\nInitial medical statements sent in with\nthe application or as a result of a new hire must be dated within 12 months\npreceding the date of application or hiring date. (4)\n\nThe medical statement must give\nsatisfactory evidence that the individual is physically fit to provide child\nday care and has no diagnosed psychiatric or emotional disorder which would\npreclude such individual from providing child day care. (5)\n\nAll providers, assistants, substitutes\nand household members must be free from communicable disease unless his/her\nhealth care provider has indicated that the presence of the communicable\ndisease does not pose a risk to the health and safety of the children in\ncare. (6)\n\nThe initial medical\nstatement for providers, assistants, and substitutes must include the results\nof a Mantoux tuberculin test or other Federally approved tuberculin test\nperformed within the 12 months preceding the date of the application. Thereafter, tuberculin tests are only required at the discretion of the\nemployee's health care provider or at the start of new employment in a\ndifferent child care program. (7)\n\nThe program must retain on file in the program a medical statement, on forms\nfurnished by the office or approved equivalents, from a health care provider\nfor each person residing in the home. (i) Such\nmedical statement must be completed before the person begins to reside in the\nchild care home, and must be dated within 12 months preceding the date of the\napplication or the date the person takes up residency at the home and must\nstate that the person has no health conditions which would endanger the health\nof children receiving day care in the home.

The caregiver must complete a\nrecertification training approved by the office in order to extend the\ncertification for each additional three year period. Where a certification\nlapses, the caregiver may not be recertified unless the caregiver completes the\ninitial medication administration training or the recertification training, as\nrequired by the office. Where enforcement action has been taken against the\nregistrant based on a failure by the program to comply with requirements for\nthe administration of medications set forth in this section, the office may\nrequire retraining or may prohibit a caregiver from being involved in the\nadministration of medications.
