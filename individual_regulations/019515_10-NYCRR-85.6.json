  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 85.6 - Admissions and hospital stays\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Inpatient hospital admissions which do not require a determination of benefit coverability under sections\n85.1\nthrough\n85.4\nof this Part and except for admissions under subdivision (f) of this section shall be deemed a covered benefit under medical assistance for the needy as provided in section\n365-a (2)(b)\nof the Social Services Law for the first three days of inpatient hospital care. To be a covered benefit after the third day of inpatient hospital care, there shall be a determination of benefit coverability prior to the end of the third day by a person designated by the Commissioner of Health. Such determination shall be for a specified period of time not to exceed the 50th percentile of length of stay norms for comparable patients which have been authorized by the Commissioner of Health or the 20th day of stay, whichever is less. If the stay is for rehabilitation of physical disability as described in subdivision (a) of section\n85.5\nof this Part, such specified period of time shall not exceed the 40th day of stay. Determination of coverability shall be based upon existence of medical conditions which can be treated only on an inpatient hospital basis, as documented in the patient's medical record. Subsequent to this initial determination of coverability, extensions of benefit coverability shall be subject to length of stay limitations of sections\n85.5\nand\n85.7\nof this Part. (b) A determination of benefit coverability under this section shall be made by a designated physician or nonphysician under a designated physician's supervision. A determination of noncoverability shall be made only by a designated physician. If such determination of noncoverability is made, any inpatient hospital care, supplies or services provided beyond three days shall not be a covered benefit under medical assistance for the needy. (c) Notice of determination shall be given to the patient's physician, the hospital administrator and, if there is a determination of noncoverability, to the patient. (d) The patient's physician or hospital administrator may, within three days of the date of such notification, appeal a determination of noncoverability in writing to the physician or physicians designated by the commissioner for such purpose. Notification of the decision on appeal shall be given to the patient's physician, the hospital administrator and the patient. If determination of noncoverability is affirmed on appeal, any inpatient hospital care, supplies or services provided beyond three days shall not be a covered benefit under medical assistance for the needy. (e) If the person designated by the Commissioner of Health decides in the course of making determinations of coverability under this section or it is determined from other sources that a physician, physicians or the hospital are admitting patients for medical conditions which can be treated on other than an inpatient hospital basis, the designated person shall give written notification to the physician(s) and the hospital that if such admissions continue, the initial three-day period of stay will no longer be deemed a covered benefit. If patients are thereafter admitted for medical conditions which can be treated on other than an inpatient hospital basis, the designated person shall notify the physician(s) and the hospital that to be a covered benefit, the first three days of inpatient stay will be subject to a determination of coverability. Such determination of coverability shall be made prior to the end of the third day of inpatient hospital stay in accordance with the procedures in subdivisions (a) through (d) of this section. If there is a determination of noncoverability, any inpatient hospital care, supplies or services provided shall not be a covered benefit under medical assistance for the needy. (f) (1)\n\nDuring such period of time as sections\n85.2\nand\n85.3\nof this Part do not apply, all surgery, other than emergency or urgent surgery, within \"medical assistance\" as defined in section\n365-a\nof the Social Services Law, shall require a determination of coverability by a person designated by the Commissioner of Health prior to admission. A determination of coverability shall be based on a finding that the proposed surgery can be performed properly only on an inpatient hospital basis. (2)\nA determination of coverability shall be for a specified period of time not to exceed the 50th percentile of length of stay norms for comparable patients which have been authorized by the commissioner or the 20th day of stay, whichever is less. If the stay is for rehabilitation of physical disability as described in section\n85.5\n(a) of this Part, such specified period of time shall not exceed the 40th day of stay. Subsequent to this initial determination of coverability, extensions of benefit coverability shall be subject to length of stay limitations of sections\n85.5\nand\n85.7\nof this Part. (3)\n\nThe required determination of coverability shall be initiated by written request from the proposing surgeon, with information adequate for making the determination. A determination of coverability shall be made by a designated physician or nonphysician under supervision of a designated physician. A determination of noncoverability shall be made only by a physician. (4)\n\nNotice of determination shall be given to the proposing surgeon who shall, if coverability is determined, incorporate such notice in the hospital record at admission. (5)\n\nThe proposing surgeon may appeal any determination of noncoverability to a physician or physicians designated by the Commissioner of Health for such purpose. Notification of decision on appeal shall be given to the proposing surgeon who shall incorporate any notice of determination of coverability in the hospital record at admission. (6)\n\nAdmissions and hospital stays solely for the purpose of performing any procedure which may be performed on an outpatient basis, as defined in paragraph (7) of this subdivision, shall not be included as inpatient care in a hospital or care in a hospital-based ambulatory surgery service or a free-standing ambulatory surgery center for purposes of coverability of benefits except that a determination of coverability may be made by a person designated by the Commissioner of Health when the medical condition of the individual patient requires that such procedure be performed on an inpatient basis in a hospital or as care in a hospital-based ambulatory surgery service or a free-standing ambulatory surgery center. For inpatient hospital, hospital-based ambulatory surgery service and free-standing ambulatory surgery center admissions for certain surgical procedures, as defined in paragraph (7) of this subdivision there shall be a determination prior to admission of the specified period of coverability as provided for in this subdivision, except for emergency admissions for which the determination of the period of coverability shall be made as soon after admission as feasible. (7)\nA procedure which may be performed on an outpatient basis (\"outpatient procedure\"), is a diagnostic test or treatment, including certain surgical procedures, that carries a low patient risk, requires minimal preand post-procedure observation and treatment, is not likely to be time consuming or followed by complications, and is not associated with a condition which would require hospitalization.

A determination of coverability shall be based upon a finding that: (1)\nsuch care, services and supplies commencing with a Friday or Saturday admission are furnished for a medical emergency; (2)\nsuch care, services and supplies commencing with a Friday or Saturday admission are required because of the necessity of emergency or urgent surgery for the alleviation of severe pain or the necessity for immediate diagnosis or treatment of conditions which threaten disability or death if not promptly diagnosed or treated; or\n(3)\nthe care, services and supplies commencing with a Friday or Saturday admission are for preoperative care for surgery which has been determined to be a covered benefit under section\n85.4\nof this Part. (h) Inpatient days beginning on a Friday or Saturday shall not be subject to the limitations of subdivision (g) of this section in hospitals determined by the commissioner or his designee to be rendering full service on a seven-day-a-week basis. A determination of \"full service\" shall be made after taking into consideration such factors as the routine availability and use of operating room services, diagnostic services and consultants, laboratory services, radiological services, pharmacy services, staff patterns consistent with full services and such other factors as the commissioner or his designee deems necessary and appropriate. (i) A determination of coverability of admissions to general hospitals for psychiatric care for persons 16 years of age and older requires that the following shall be met: (1)\n\nThe patient's hospital medical record shall contain one or more of the following as documentation for the necessity for admission: (i) evidence of behavior or thought by the patient, described in the patient's medical record, that is likely to lead to consequences which are a significant danger to the patient or others; (ii)\nevidence of deviant behavior exhibited by the patient and described in the patient's medical record, which is no longer tolerable to the patient or to society and is likely to be ameliorated by treatment at this level of care; (iii)\nthe finding that ambulatory treatment has been unsuccessful in halting or reversing the course of the mental illness, and that inpatient treatment at this level of care is needed in order to prevent or manage behavior or thought described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph; (iv)\nthe finding that the patient requires a type of therapy which cannot be initiated or continued unless in a supervised setting at this level of care; or\n(v) the finding that the patient has a condition other than mental disorder which requires hospital care, but psychological components cannot be handled as well on other units. (2)\nA specific treatment plan shall be developed and shall have been implemented within three days following admission. (3)\n\nThe patient's response to treatment must be observed and shall be recorded in the patient's medical record. (4)\n\nAn anticipated discharge plan shall be developed by the medical staff and shall be recorded in the patient's medical record no later than the fifth day following admission. (5)\nA review of the necessity for continued stay shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (b) of section\n85.5\nof this Part. The patient's hospital medical record shall contain one or more of the following as documentation for the necessity for continued hospital stay: (i) evidence that there is an immediate physical danger to the patient or others and this level of care is appropriate; (ii)\nevidence that the magnitude of the abnormal behavior of the patient remains intolerable to the patient or society, and clinical evidence recorded in the medical chart justifies an extension of stay at this level of care under treatment; (iii)\na finding that if the patient were to be discharged, subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph; would be likely to recur soon and continued hospitalization would be likely to prevent this. The medical record must document the reason why it is believed likely to recur soon and why continued hospitalization would be likely to prevent the recurrence; (iv)\na finding that the patient's care requires the use and regulation of a specific modality, but the patient lacks motivation and refuses, or is unable, to cooperate under a program of care at another level; (v) evidence suggests that the patient can improve sufficiently to be treated in an ambulatory setting or other level of care only after additional hospitalization because a major revision of treatment plan has occurred such as (\na\n) change in treatment regimen or (\nb\n) patient relapsed unexpectedly; or\n(vi)\na condition other than mental disorder requires this level of care, but psychological component cannot be handled as well on other services.
