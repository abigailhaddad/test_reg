  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 750-2.8 - Disposal system operation and quality control\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nThe disposal system shall not receive or\nbe committed to receive wastes beyond its design capacity for volume and\ncharacter of wastes treated without written approval of the regional water\nengineer. Nor shall the system operation be impaired by alterations to the\ntype, degree, or capacity of treatment provided; disposal of treated effluent; or treatment and disposal of separated scum, liquids, solids or combination\nthereof resulting from the treatment process without written approval of the\ndepartment or its duly authorized representative. (2)\n\nThe permittee shall, at all times, properly operate and maintain all disposal facilities, which are installed or\nused by the permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions of the permit. Proper operation and maintenance also includes as a minimum, the following: (i) a preventive/corrective maintenance\nprogram for all critical facilities and systems of treatment and control (or\nrelated appurtenances) which are installed or used by the permittee to achieve\ncompliance with the conditions of the permit. A facility or system is critical\nif it contains process equipment that is essential for proper operation and\nnecessary to achieve compliance with the applicable SPDES permit effluent\nlimits; and\n(ii)\nwritten procedures\nfor operation and maintenance, training new operators, adequate laboratory\ncontrols and appropriate quality assurance. This provision requires the\noperation of installed backup or auxiliary facilities or similar systems only\nwhen the operation is necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of\nthe permit. (3)\n\nWhen\nrequired under Part 650 of this Title, sufficient personnel meeting\nqualifications for operators of sewage treatment works as required therein and\nadditional maintenance personnel shall be employed to satisfactorily operate\nand maintain the treatment works. (4)\n\nThe permittee shall not discharge\nfloating solids or visible foam. (5)\n\nThe permittee and operator shall operate\nthe wastewater treatment facility in such a manner as to minimize the discharge\nof pollutants to a degree that is achievable when compared to standard\npractices for operation of such wastewater treatment facilities. (6)\n\nThe permittee and operator shall operate\nthe wastewater treatment facility in such a manner as to minimize odors and\nother nuisance conditions to a degree that is achievable when compared to\nstandard practices for operation of such wastewater treatment\nfacilities. (b) Bypass. (1)\n\nBypass not exceeding\nlimitations. The permittee may allow any bypass to occur that does not cause\neffluent limitations to be violated, but only if it also is for essential\nmaintenance, repair or replacement to assure efficient and proper operation. These bypasses are not subject to the paragraph (2) of this subdivision, provided that written notice is submitted prior to the bypass in accordance\nwith section\n750-2.7\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart (if anticipated) or (if unanticipated) with the discharge monitoring\nreport for the reporting period during which the bypass occurred. Covered under\nthis paragraph is the diversion of wastewater or storm water around any portion\nof a treatment facility in accordance with a department approved plan for\nwastewater or storm water management (provided that such plan is in compliance\nwith applicable law and regulation). (2)\n\nProhibition of bypass. Except as provided\nfor in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, bypass is prohibited, and the\ndepartment may take enforcement action against a permittee for bypass, unless: (i) bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of\nlife, personal injury, public health hazard, environmental degradation or\nsevere property damage; (ii)\nthere\nwere no feasible alternatives to the bypass such as the use of auxiliary\ntreatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during\nnormal period of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if\nadequate backup equipment should have been installed in the exercise of\nreasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass that occurred during normal\nperiods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance or if designed and\ninstalled backup equipment that could have prevented or mitigated the impact of\nthe bypass is not operating during the bypass; and\n(iii)\nthe permittee submitted notices as\nrequired under section\n750-2.7\nof this Subpart and, excepting emergency conditions, the proposed bypass was accepted by the\ndepartment. (c) Upset. (1)\n\nEffect of an upset. An upset constitutes\nan affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with such permit\neffluent limitations if the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subdivision\nare met. No determination made during administrative review of claims that\nnoncompliance was caused by upset, and before an action for noncompliance, is\nfinal administrative action subject to judicial review. (2)\n\nConditions necessary for a demonstration\nof upset. A permittee who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset\nshall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operation logs, or\nother relevant evidence that: (i) an upset\noccurred and that the permittee can identify the cause(s) of the\nupset; (ii)\nthe permitted facility\nwas, at the time, being properly operated; (iii)\nthe permittee submitted notice of the\nincident for which an upset defense in being claimed as required in section\n750-2.7\nof this Subpart; and\n(iv)\nthe permittee implemented\nany mitigation and assessment required under section\n750-2.7\n(f) and (g)\nof this Subpart. (3)\n\nBurden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the permittee seeking to\nestablish the occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof. (d) Special condition-\ndisposal systems with septic tanks. Unless otherwise directed by the Regional Water\n\nEngineer, if a septic tank is installed as part of the disposal system, it\nshall be inspected by the permittee or his agent for scum and sludge\naccumulation at intervals not to exceed one year's duration, and such\naccumulation will be removed before the depth of either exceeds one-fourth of\nthe liquid depth so that no settleable solids or scum will leave in the septic\ntank effluent. Such accumulation shall be disposed of in accordance with all\napplicable law and regulation. (e) Residuals management. The permittee shall properly store or dispose of\ncollected screenings, sludges, other solids or precipitates removed from the\npermitted discharges, intakes or supply waters. Proper storage or disposal\nshall prevent creation of nuisance conditions or the entry of such materials\ninto State waters and shall be in a manner approved by the department. Any live\nfish, shellfish, or other animals collected or trapped as a result of intake\nwater screening or treatment should be returned to their water body habitat. The permittee shall maintain records of disposal on all effluent screenings, sludges and other solids associated with the discharge(s) herein described. The\nfollowing data shall be compiled and reported to the department upon\nrequest: (1)\nthe sources of the\nmaterials to be disposed of; (2)\nthe approximate volumes, weights, water content and (if other than sewage\nsludge) chemical composition; (3)\nthe method by which they were removed and transported, including the name and\npermit number of the waste transporter; and\n(4)\ntheir final disposal locations. (f) Biosolids reuse. Permittees shall make reasonable efforts, to the extent\npractical, reuse biosolids. (g) POSS operation\nrequirements. Owners and operators of POSSs must properly operate and\nmaintain the POSS. Proper operation and maintenance includes at a minimum, the\nfollowing: (1)\na preventive/corrective\nmaintenance program for all critical components of the collection system that\nincludes provisions requiring the maintenance of installed backup or auxiliary\ncomponents or similar systems when the proper operation of such component or\nsystem is essential for preventing discharges of untreated or partially treated\nsewage; and\n(2)\nwritten procedures\nfor operation and maintenance of the POSS and training new operators.
