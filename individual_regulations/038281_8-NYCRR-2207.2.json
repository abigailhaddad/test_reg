Institutions which offer undergraduate degrees and\nparticipate in the tuition assistance program are eligible to participate in\nthe award program under this Part; provided, however, that the tuition for the\nprogram in which a student is enrolled totals at least $100 per year. In order\nto be eligible, an institution must file, pursuant to section\n2207.3\nof this Part, an annual\napplication on forms prescribed by the president. (b) Institutional allocation of funds. The\ntotal amount of funds for awards at a participating institution for an academic\nyear shall be that amount determined by multiplying the annual total\nappropriation for this program by a ratio whose numerator shall be the\nundergraduate part-time degree credit enrollment at the institution during the\npreceding academic year and whose denominator shall be the aggregate\nundergraduate part-time degree credit enrollment at all participating\ninstitutions in such academic year. (c) Selection of award recipients. Institutions shall select recipients from those candidates who fulfill the\ncriteria set forth in section\n2207.1\nof this Part. Prior to\nsubmission of a recipient to the corporation, the institution must obtain a\ncomplete application, as required by section\n2207.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart, from each recipient. Institutions shall consider those eligible students\nwho demonstrate the greatest amount of financial need remaining after all\navailable grants have been applied to educational costs, and shall give\npreference, where possible, to students who would be otherwise unable to\nattempt or continue postsecondary education. The total number of recipients and\nthe amount of awards shall be limited by the institutional allocation of funds\npursuant to subdivision 8 of section\n666\nof the\n\nEducation Law. (d) Amount of\nawards. The amount of the award shall be determined by the participating\ninstitution, subject to the following limitations: (1)\n\nThe annual award shall be in an amount up\nto $2,000, or tuition, whichever is less. (2)\n\nThe award for any term shall not exceed\nthe lesser of: that proportion of $2,000 equal to the proportion the term bears\nto the academic year (i.e., $1,000 per semester, $666.66 per quarter or the\nequivalent), and the tuition charge for that term. However, in no event shall\nthe total of the awards received by an individual for an academic year exceed\n$2,000, or tuition, whichever is less. (3)\n\nIn no event shall the award for a term\nexceed the amount by which the tuition, exclusive of educational fees, payable\nby the student exceeds the total of all other State, Federal or other\neducational aid which the commissioner has identified by regulation as\nduplicative of the purposes of tuition awards pursuant to this Part. (e) Recordkeeping. (1)\n\nAll participating institutions shall be\nsubject to audit and program review pursuant to the provisions of article 14 of\nthe Education Law. Participating institutions shall be required to refund the\namount of any award paid in error, in the event the president determines that\nsuch award was paid due to the failure of the institution to adhere to the\nrequirements set forth in this Part. (2)\n\nParticipating institutions shall maintain\nthe following records for a period of five years following the end of an\nacademic year for which an award under this Part is made: (i) a copy, or such other record acceptable\nto the president, of the application submitted by all applicants pursuant to\nsection\n2207.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart, and all ancillary documents which may be required to be submitted with\nthat application; (ii)\na copy of\nthe Pell grant application submitted by the recipient pursuant to section\n2207.1\n(g) of this\n\nPart, or other documentation evidencing such application; (iii)\na record of the institution's\nevaluation of the applicant's financial need as required by subdivision (c) of\nthis section; (iv)\na record for\neach term for which a recipient receives an award under this Part, which record\nshall contain information including but not limited to the recipient's total\ntuition charges, all financial aid received by the recipient and evidence of\nthe waiver of tuition in the amount of the award received under this Part; and\n(v) an academic record for each\nterm for which a recipient receives an award under this Part, including a\nlisting of all courses the recipient enrolls for, grades received and\ncumulative average for the term.
