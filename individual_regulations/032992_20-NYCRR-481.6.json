  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 481.6 - Gross weight method, tax on unladen vehicles\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 503, subd. 1\n(a) As heretofore indicated, under the gross\nweight method, if a motor vehicle is operated without any load whatsoever the\ntax is based on its unloaded weight. The applicable tax rate is determined from\nthe maximum gross weight table set forth in section\n481.3, supra. If its unloaded weight is less than 18,001 pounds, no\ntax is payable on any mileage operated by it when empty. Example 1: If the maximum gross weight of a refrigerator truck is\n41,000 pounds and its unloaded weight is 22,400 pounds, the tax rate is $.008\nper mile (the rate applicable to 22,400 pounds) when operating without any\nload, whereas when operating with a load the rate is $.013 per mile (the rate\napplicable to 41,000 pounds). Example 2: If the unloaded weight of a truck is 10,000 pounds and\nits maximum gross weight is 37,000 pounds, its operations without any load are\nnot taxable but when operating with a load, the applicable tax rate is\n$.012. (b) The tax is based\non the unloaded weight of the motor vehicle only when it is operated without\nany load whatsoever. If the motor vehicle is partially loaded the tax must be\ncomputed on the maximum gross weight. Example: If the maximum gross weight of a motor vehicle is 37,000\npounds, its unloaded weight is 10,000 pounds and it is carrying a load weighing\n2,000 pounds, the rate of tax is $.012 per mile (the rate applicable to 37,000\npounds). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n481.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
