  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 754.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A birth center\nis a diagnostic and treatment center organized to provide care to low-risk\npatients during pregnancy, labor and delivery who require a stay of less than\n24 hours after birth. Services are provided by a physician or licensed midwife\nto women during a normal and an uncomplicated pregnancy, labor, birth and\npuerperium. Birth center services are based on a philosophy that promotes a\nfamily-centered approach to care and views pregnancy and delivery as a normal\nphysiological process requiring limited technological and pharmacological\nsupport. The center services are designed to meet the specific needs of the\npopulation being served and promote optimum pregnancy outcomes. The licensed\nmidwife or physician provides care for the low-risk woman during pregnancy and\nstays with her during labor from the time of admission to the birth center\nthrough the immediate postpartum period providing continuous physical and\nemotional support, evaluating progress, facilitating family interaction and\nassisting the woman in labor and delivery. Nurse practitioners may provide\nprenatal and post partum care to birthing center patients. They may also\nprovide supportive care during labor and delivery, but the attending provider\nfor birth must be a physician or licensed midwife. (b) A patient at low risk means a patient\nwith a normal medical, surgical and obstetrical history and a normal, uncomplicated prenatal course as determined by adequate prenatal care, and\nprospects for a normal uncomplicated birth. A pregnant woman, parturient or\nnewborn shall be determined as low risk during the prenatal period, intrapartum\nand postpartum by the use of standardized criteria based on generally accepted\nstandards of professional practice such as those approved by the department's\n\nPrenatal/Perinatal Advisory Council Subcommittee on Birth Centers in Guidelines\nfor Birth Centers in New York State. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n754.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
