Tit. 1 § 20.61 - Computation of the uniform price\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe market administrator shall, on or before the 14th day\nof each month, audit for mathematical correctness and obvious errors the report\nsubmitted for the preceding month by each handler. If the unreserved cash\nbalance in the producer settlement fund to be included in the computation is\nless than two cents per hundredweight of pool milk on all reports, the report\nof any handler who has not made payment of the last monthly pool debt account\nrendered pursuant to section\n20.71\nof this Part shall not be\nincluded in the computation of the uniform price. The report of such handler\nshall not be included in the computation for succeeding months until he has\nmade full payment of outstanding monthly pool debts. Subject to the\naforementioned conditions, the market administrator shall compute the uniform\nprice in the following manner: (a) Combine into one total the net pool obligations of all handlers computed\npursuant to section\n20.60\nof this Part. (b) Subtract the total of payments required\nto be made pursuant to section\n20.77\nof this Part. (c) Subtract an amount computed by\nmultiplying the quantity of pool milk delivered directly from farms to pool\nplants and partial pool plants that was not put into a tank truck prior to such\ndelivery, by a rate per hundredweight that is equal to the rate specified in\nsection\n20.55\nof this Part. (d) -(e) [Reserved]\n(f) Add the amount of unreserved cash in the\nproducer settlement fund. (g) Subtract an amount equal to not less than eight cents nor more than nine cents\nper hundredweight of pool milk and receipts of concentrated fluid milk products\nfor which a payment obligation is computed pursuant to section\n20.60\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Part to provide against the contingency of errors in reports and payments\nor of delinquencies in payments by handlers. (h) Divide the result obtained in subdivision\n(g) of this section by the total pounds of pool milk delivered by dairy farmers\nand the total pounds of concentrated fluid milk products for which a payment\nobligation is computed pursuant to section\n20.60\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Part. The result shall be known as the uniform price. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n20.61\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
