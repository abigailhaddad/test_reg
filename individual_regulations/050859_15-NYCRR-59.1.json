  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 59.1 - Brief history of the bicycle regulations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prior to 1972, New York had been\nexperiencing a rise in the number of bicycle injuries and fatalities. This rise\nprompted the passage of chapter 848 of the Laws of 1972. This new law required\nthe Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to promulgate regulations regarding the\nvisibility of bicycles in all directions. (b) To accomplish this purpose, the\n\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles held public hearings and did considerable\nresearch. In December of 1972 this Part was first promulgated. Between 1973 and\n1975, this Part was amended five times. The bicycle regulations were highly\neffective in making a bicycle visible in all directions. Front and rear\nreflectors, pedal reflectors and side reflectors or reflective tires were\nrequired. When appropriate, reflector requirements were updated to include wide\nangle reflectors. Although the regulations allowed wide angle reflex reflectors\nto be used as a means of side reflectivity, as a practical matter, only\nreflective tires were used to accomplish this requirement. (c) In 1976, three factors combined to void\nthis Part. First, the Consumer Product Safety Commission Improvements Act of\n1975 was signed into law. The Consumer Product Safety Commission regulates\nbicycles on the Federal level. The commission had regulations of its own on\nbicycles in force since 1974. Under the Improvements Act, these CPSC\nregulations may or may not have preempted New York. (d) Next, the bicycle industry sued New York\nto bar enforcement of this Part. The bicycle industry was granted a preliminary\ninjunction. (e) Finally, the New\n\nYork Legislature made the issue academic by passing chapter 887 of the Laws of\n1976. This statute repealed the authority to promulgate regulations governing\nbicycle visibility in all directions. In its place was the authority to approve\ntypes of reflectors or tires to be used for side reflectivity. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n59.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
