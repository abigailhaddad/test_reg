  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 32.13 - Adoption of ANSI B77 standard\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following ANSI B77 2006 sections are to be modified\nas indicated. Text in brackets [ ] is to be deleted. Underlined text is to be\nadded to the ANSI sections. ANSI B77 Section 1 is not adopted and is excluded\nin its entirety. ANSI B77, Section 2.1.1.6.2\n\nFoundations\n\nIn determining the resistance of the soil to motion of\nthe foundation, the subsoil conditions at the site shall be considered, including any buoyancy due to groundwater that may be present. If the\nresistance of the soil is not practically determinable, the foundation or\nanchorage [should]\nshall\nbe designed as a gravity anchor, using a coefficient of friction appropriate to the general character of the\nsoil. Bottoms of foundations shall be below the normal frost depth unless\nresting on non-frost susceptible soil or solid rock. Foundations on rock shall\nbe firmly anchored to solid rock, unless designed as gravity\nfoundations. The top of concrete foundations shall not be less than 6\ninches (150 mm) above finished grade unless specific direction for the\nprotection of the foundation and structural steel below grade is specified by\nthe designer. The design shall have a minimum factor of safety of 2 in\nresisting overturning and, concurrently, 2 against sliding, under dead-load and\nlive-load conditions. The minimum factors shall be 1.5 under these loadings\nplus wind acting simultaneously. ANSI B77, Section 2.1.1.11.1 Acceptance\ninspection\n\nBefore an aerial tramway that is new or relocated or that\nhas not been operated for routine maintenance within the previous 2 years is\nopened to the public, it shall be given a thorough inspection by [qualified\npersonnel]\nthe Commissioner\nto verify compliance with the\nplans and specifications of the designer. ANSI B77, Section 2.1.1.11.2 Acceptance\ntests\n\nBefore an aerial tramway that is new or relocated or that\nhas not been operated for routine maintenance within the previous 2 years is\nopened to the public, it shall be given thorough tests by qualified personnel\nto verify compliance with the plans and specifications of the designer. The\ndesigner or manufacturer shall propose and submit an acceptance test procedure. The Commissioner shall be advised by the Owner 10 days prior to the\ndate of the test. Thorough load and operating tests\ndone in the\npresence of the Commissioner\nshall be performed under full loading and\nany partial loadings that may provide the most adverse operating\nconditions. ANSI B77, Section 2.1.2.6 Brakes\n\nThe aerial tramway shall have the following friction-type\nbrakes: - service brake (see 2.1.2.6.1); - drive sheave brake (see 2.1.2.6.2)\nNOTE - For requirements of systems with or without track cable brakes, see\n2.1.4.4.2. All drive braking systems shall be designed and monitored\nto ensure that: a)\nonce the aerial\ntramway begins movement in the intended direction, the brakes are maintained in\nthe open position; b)\nthe service\nbrake shall not open prior to the prime mover providing control for the\nropeway; c)\nmultiple brakes or\nbrake systems shall not be simultaneously applied such that excessive\ndeceleration is applied to the aerial tramway under any design loading\ncondition; d)\nthe failure of one\nbraking system to stop the aerial tramway shall automatically initiate a second\nbraking system, if any. The service brake and drive sheave brake shall be\ndesigned such that failure of one braking system shall not impair the function\nof the other systems. All brakes shall have the braking force applied by\nsprings, weights, or other approved forms of stored energy. Hydraulic systems shall be designed to reduce the\npossibility of oil contaminating the braking surfaces in the event of a failure\nof a hose, cylinder or fitting. The service brake and drive sheave brake shall be\ndesigned to assure operation under all anticipated conditions. All drive braking systems shall be capable of operation\nto comply with the daily inspections and periodic testing. The manufacturer or a Qualified Engineer shall furnish a\nwritten procedure to be followed and shall specify the auxiliary equipment\nnecessary for periodic testing and adjustment of the holding force of each\nbrake.

ANSI B77, Section 4.1.1.11.1 Acceptance\ninspection\n\nBefore an aerial lift that is new or relocated or that\nhas not been operated for routine maintenance within the previous 2 years is\nopened to the public, it shall be given a thorough inspection by [qualified\npersonnel]\nthe Commissioner\nto verify compliance with the\nplans and specifications of the designer. ANSI B77, Section 4.1.1.11.2 Acceptance\ntests\n\nBefore an aerial lift that is new or relocated or that\nhas not been operated for routine maintenance within the previous 2 years is\nopened to the public, it shall be given thorough tests by qualified personnel\nto verify compliance with the plans and specifications of the designer. The\ndesigner or manufacturer shall propose and submit an acceptance test procedure. The Commissioner shall be advised by the Owner 10 days prior to the\ndate of the test. Thorough load and operating tests\ndone in the\npresence of the Commissioner\nshall be performed under full loading and\nany partial loadings that may provide the most adverse operating\nconditions. ANSI B77, Section 4.1.2.1 Power\nunits\n\nAll aerial lifts shall be equipped with at least two\npower units, one of which, at a minimum, meets the requirements of\n4.1.2.1.2. All power units shall have the capacity to handle the\nmost unfavorable design loading conditions, including the starting of the\naerial lift loaded to 110% of capacity in weight. If downhill capacity is\ndesired, the aerial lift shall comply with 4.1.2.4. Where manual multispeed\ntransmissions are used on a power unit, they shall not be shifted when the\naerial lift is moving. Where reverse capability is provided on a power unit for\nan aerial lift, provisions shall be made to prevent accidentally shifting into\nreverse whenever the aerial lift is operating. No aerial lift shall be operated using a single power\nunit, except for unloading passengers or for maintenance purposes. [EXCEPTION - An aerial lift may continue loading\npassengers if the following requirements are met: a)\n\nThe power unit in use meets the\nrequirements of a prime mover (see 4.1.2.1.1); b)\n\nEvacuation gear and personnel shall be\nimmediately available in sufficient number and quantity to evacuate the entire\naerial lift in a period specified in the evacuation plan (see 4.3.2.5.7).]\nIf changes are made to the drive train components that\neffect rotational inertia (i.e. removal of electric motor), the changes to\nstopping distances and deceleration rates shall meet the requirements of\n4.1.2.5. ANSI B77, Section 4.1.2.6 Brakes and rollback\ndevice\n\nThe aerial lift shall have the following friction-type\nbrakes and other devices as specified in table 4-3: - service brake (see 4.1.2.6.1); - drive sheave brake (see 4.1.2.6.2); - rollback device (see 4.1.2.6.3); - drive train backstop (see 4.1.2.6.4). Exception: A drive train backstop is only\nrequired of lifts installed after 1995, existing lifts with drive train\nbackstops shall comply with section 4.1.2.6.4. All braking systems shall be designed to ensure\nthat: a)\nonce the aerial\nlift begins movement in the intended direction, the brakes are maintained in\nthe open position; b)\nthe service\nbrake shall not open prior to the drive system developing sufficient torque to\nprevent overhauling; EXCEPTION - For an aerial lift that overhauls only in the\nreverse direction, a drive train backstop may be used in lieu of the\nabove. c)\nmultiple brakes\nor brake systems shall not be simultaneously applied such that excessive\ndeceleration is applied to the aerial lift under any anticipated conditions of\nloading; d)\nthe failure of one\nbraking system to properly decelerate the aerial lift shall automatically\ninitiate a second braking system, on an overhauling forward direction aerial\nlift. The service brake, drive sheave brake, rollback device, and drive train backstop device shall be designed such that failure of one\nsystem will not impair the function of the other systems. All brakes shall have\nthe braking force applied by springs, weights, or other approved forms of\nstored energy. The service brake, drive sheave brake, rollback, and\ndrive train backstop devices shall be designed to assure operation under all\nanticipated conditions. Each braking system shall be capable of operation to\ncomply with daily inspections and periodic testing. The manufacturer or a Qualified Engineer shall furnish a\nwritten procedure to be followed, and specify the auxiliary equipment necessary\nfor periodic testing and adjustment of the holding force of each brake and\nbackstop device. The procedure shall additionally specify: e)\nthe minimum and maximum holding force for\nthe service brake and drive sheave brake independently; f)\nthe minimum and maximum stopping distance\nfor the service brake and drive sheave brake independently, with a specified\nloading condition. This baseline procedure shall be performed at the\ncompletion of the acceptance test and then at the frequency specified in order\nto demonstrate the ability of each brake to produce the required force. Testing shall be accomplished as part of normal\nmaintenance during the operating season, but shall not be performed when the\naerial lift is open to the public. As a minimum, this testing shall be performed monthly\nduring the operating season. If a device is permanently installed to cause a\nbrake, rollback, or drive train backstop device to be disabled for testing, it\nshall be monitored so that the aerial lift cannot be operated in its normal\nmode when the brakes are so disabled. ANSI B77, Section 4.1.2.6.2 Drive sheave\nbrake\n\nThe drive sheave brake shall operate on the drive sheave\nassembly. The drive sheave brake shall be capable of being activated both\nmanually and automatically to stop and hold the aerial lift under the most\nunfavorable design loading condition. Deceleration rates or stopping distances\nspecified in 4.1.2.5 shall be achieved by the drive sheave brake without the\naid of other braking devices or drive regeneration. Application of the drive sheave brake shall automatically\ndisconnect the power source to the power unit in use. This brake shall act\nautomatically when the speed of the haul rope exceeds the design value by 15%\nin either direction on an overhauling lift. The controls for the brake shall not be located\nin a position that would require the operator or attendant to pass through the\npath of moving carriers in order to operate the controls. Controls shall not be\nmore than 6 feet from the normal operating position of the\noperator. ANSI B77, Section 4.1.2.6.4 Drive train\nbackstop\nA drive train backstop device shall conform to the\nfollowing requirements: a)\nA\ndrive train backstop device is a one-way or overrunning clutch device. The\ndrive train shall be so arranged that there is no belt, friction clutch, or\nsimilar friction-type device between the backstop device and the drive\nsheave; b)\n\nThe backstop device\nshall be rated for the maximum design load; c)\n\nUnder the most unfavorable design loading\ncondition, the backstop device shall automatically prevent reverse rotation of\nthe aerial lift before the aerial lift travels in excess of 36 inches (915 mm)\nin the reverse direction; d)\nall backstops installed after 1995 shall be capable of being\ndisengaged.

When unlined sheave grooves are used for wire rope, they\n[should]\nshall\nbe V-shaped and shall have rounded bottoms with\na radius equal to approximately 55% of the rope diameter. When lined sheave grooves are used, the allowable bearing\npressures of the liner material shall not be exceeded. ANSI B77, Section 4.1.2.8.2 Haul rope terminal\nsheaves (Bull wheels and deflection sheaves)\n\nProvisions shall be incorporated in the terminal design\nto retain the terminal sheaves in their approximate normal operating position\nin the event of failure of the bearings, shaft, or hub\non lifts\ninstalled after 1995. Provisions shall be incorporated in the terminal and rope\nretention design to control the position of the rope, including possible\noverhaul, to minimize the effects of its departure from its normal operating\nposition. The minimum diameter of terminal sheaves shall be 80\ntimes the nominal diameter of the haul rope. The sheave assembly or related\nstructures shall be designed to minimize the probability of a deropement. A\nflange extension of 1-1/2 times the rope diameter (measured radially from the\nbottom of the rope groove) shall be one acceptable means of minimizing the\nprobability of deropement when in full compliance with the provisions of\n4.1.2.8.4. Haul rope terminal sheaves that act as driving, braking, or holding sheaves shall be so designed that the haul rope does not slip in the\nsheave groove. The design coefficient of friction for a particular sheave liner\nshall not exceed the values shown in table 4-4. ANSI B77, Section 4.1.2.9.3 Floating tension\nsheave carriages\n\nThe sheave mounting shall be installed and operated in\nsuch a manner that the haul rope, in every case, considering every possibility\nof overloading, remains in the center of the sheave groove. The lateral tilt of\nthe sheave shall not exceed [2]\n1\ndegrees from the horizontal\nwhen in a stationary position, and when the up-going and down-going unloaded\ncarriers are equidistant from the sheave. To prevent excessive lateral tilt in case a loaded\ncarrier passes around the sheave, the tension system or anchor cables shall be\nconnected to at least two points on the mounting frame of the sheave. The\nconnections of the tension system or anchor cables to the sheave frame and the\nsupport points of the cables shall be spaced a minimum of 70% of the pitch\ndiameter of the sheave and increased as necessary to limit the allowable\nlateral tilt of the sheave to a maximum of 6 degrees from the static position\nwhen passing a carrier with full design load. The design shall incorporate provision for adjustment to\ncontrol the position of the haul rope entering the terminal sheave. ANSI B77, Section 4.1.4.4.2 Cabin\n\nFully enclosed passenger cabins shall be ventilated. They\nshall be equipped with doors that fill the entire entrance opening.

The sheaves for the return rope shall\nbe installed in a manner to prevent a passenger from contacting the rope or\nbeing hit by one of the returning towing devices. All line sheaves shall be so\nguarded that towing devices cannot become entangled in the sheaves or sheave\nsupports while traveling in either a forward or reverse direction. ANSI B77, Section 5.1.4.3.2\n\nSlippage\n\nThe rope grip shall be designed and installed so as to\nresist a force which tends to slide it along the haul rope, and which is a\nminimum of 2 times the force required to move a carrier along a properly\nlubricated haul rope at its steepest incline, under the most adverse conditions\nof carrier loading. The grip designer shall specify the proper grip\ninstallation and testing procedures, and for clamping type grips, the minimum\nforce below which the grip [should]\nshall\nnot slip on the rope\nand a maximum force above which the grip should slip on the rope.

This factor of safety is\ndefined as follows: With the grip in its operating position (gripping the rope\nor equivalent), a downward load, equal to the dead load of the carrier plus 6\ntimes the design live load, shall not cause any part of the grip to\nfail; b)\n\nThose parts whose stress\nis not changed by application of live load shall be designed on the basis of an\nallowable stress of not more than the yield point divided by 3.0. In the design\nof springs, where used, the allowable stress may be increased if load tests are\nconducted by an approved testing laboratory to provide assurances that the\nfatigue life of the actual spring is more than ample for the various applied\nloads; c)\n\nThe material of which the\ngrip is made shall be selected or selected and treated to obtain optimum impact\nresistance; d)\n\nSpecial attention\nshall be paid to fatigue considerations. A grip that has not been proved in\nservice [should]\nshall\nbe subjected to fatigue tests. The manufacturer's quality control provision shall assure\nthat the grips and their parts meet the designer's specifications and the\nforegoing criteria. ANSI B77, Section 5.1.4.4.4 Towing Devices for\n\nRecreational Devices\n\nThe connection between the towing device and a\nrecreational device shall be designed to minimize inadvertent detachment due to\nline surges including stops and starts and [should]\nshall\nnot\nbe detached by passenger movements without their reaching the towing\ndevice. The designer shall specify the following relative to any\ntowing device: a)\n\nThe\nallowable loading to which the towing device may be subjected; b)\nthe specifications relating to how the\ntowing device is to be used, (i.e. if it is designed for use with a\nrecreational device.); c)\nthe\ncharacteristics of the connection details appropriate for the connection of the\nrecreational device to the towing device. ANSI B77, Section 5.3.1.2 Signs\n\nSee normative Annex D for public sign requirements. The requirements of Annex D shall only be required for lifts installed\nafter the effective date of this standard.

See 5.2.1.3 for electrical warnings. The sign \"Personnel Working on Lift - Do Not Start\" or a\nsimilar warning sign shall be posted as required by 5.2.10. ANSI B77, Section 5.3.2.2 Minimum operating\npersonnel\n\nThe following personnel are the minimum that shall be\nrequired: a)\nan operator who\nshall be in charge of each surface lift; b)\none attendant who shall be on duty at each\nloading area; c)\none attendant who\nshall be on duty at each unloading area. NOTE - An operator may serve concurrently as an operator\nand an attendant at a loading or unloading area that may be adjacent to the\noperator's station unless the duties of that area preclude his/her maintaining\nreasonable surveillance of the entire surface lift operation. The above regulations for minimum operating personnel may\nbe modified in the following cases: d)\n\nSurface lifts may be operated with a\nsingle operator at the loading station provided the following conditions are\nmet: 1)\n\nThe length of the surface lift, measured from the loading area to the stop gate, shall not exceed 800 feet (244\nmeters); 2)\n\nThe entire tow path and\nthe entire haul rope system shall be visible to the operator; 3)\n\nThe surface lift shall have a clearly\nidentified stop switch located at the unloading area, in addition to the\nrequired stop gate; 4)\n\nThe operator\nshall have all surface lift controls immediately available; 5)\n\nThe restarting of the surface lift\nfollowing actuation of an automatic or manual stopping device shall be\nimpossible until clearance is assured and the automatic or manual stopping\ndevice(s) has been reset by an authorized person; 6)\n\nThere shall be no obstructions at the top\nbull wheel area that could come into contact with a passenger who might fail to\nunload. e)\n\nSurface lifts\nprovided with television surveillance of sections of the tow path and\ndesignated unloading stations not visible to the operator do not require an\nunloading attendant, provided conditions (3) through (6) are enforced and the\nunloading areas of the surface lift meet the requirements of 5.1.1.9. NOTE - When specifically approved, platter lifts with\nsingle passenger hangers do not require either an unloading attendant or\ntelevision surveillance providing conditions (3) through (6) are enforced and\nthe unloading area of the platter lift meets all manufacturer's design\nspecifications.]\nANSI B77, Section 5.3.2.5.9 Bypass\nrequirements\n\nThe use of temporary circuits that have been installed\nfor the purpose of bypassing failed electrical circuit(s) (see 5.2.6) shall\nmeet these requirements in the following order: a)\n\nThe condition that the circuit indicated\nis in default shall be thoroughly inspected to ensure an electrical operating\ncircuit malfunction, rather than the indicated condition, actually\nexists; b)\n\nThe bypass shall be\nauthorized only by the surface lift supervisor or his/her designated\nrepresentative; c)\n\nWhen a bypass is\nin operation, the function bypassed shall be under constant, close visual\nobservation; d)\n\nThe use of a bypass\ncircuit shall be logged and shall indicate when, who authorized, and for what\nduration a bypass was used; e)\n\nThe\noperator control panel shall indicate that a bypass is in use. f)\n\nWhen a required surface lift\ncontrol circuit is bypassed, all passengers shall be off loaded and no\npassengers other than maintenance personnel being transported to the repair\nsite shall be allowed to board the lift until the malfunction is\ncorrected.

The\ndesigner's instructions shall be followed if they are more restrictive than\nthese requirements. Movements shall be recorded in the Maintenance records (see\n5.3.5.2 and 5.3.5.3). As each grip is relocated, the haul rope shall be\nexamined for deterioration at or near the grip location. A Qualified Engineer\nshall supply information to the owner to enable him/her to identify excessive\nslippage. ANSI B77, Section 6.1.1.6.2\n\nFoundations\n\nIn determining the resistance of the soil to motion of\nthe foundation, the subsoil conditions at the site shall be considered, including any buoyancy due to groundwater that may be present. If the\nresistance of the soil is not practically determinable, the foundation or\nanchorage [should]\nshall\nbe designed as a gravity anchor, using a coefficient of friction appropriate to the general character of the\nsoil. Bottoms of foundations shall be below the normal frost depth unless\nresting on non-frost susceptible soil or solid rock. Foundations on rock shall\nbe firmly anchored to solid rock, unless designed as gravity\nfoundations. The top of concrete foundations shall not be less than 6\ninches (150 mm) above finished grade unless specific direction for the\nprotection of the foundation and structural steel below grade is specified by\nthe designer. The design shall have a minimum factor of safety of 2 in\nresisting overturning and, concurrently, 2 against sliding, under dead-load and\nlive-load conditions. The minimum factors shall be 1.5 under these loadings\nplus wind acting simultaneously. ANSI B77, Section 6.1.1.7\n\nCommunications\nA permanently installed two-way voice communication\nsystem shall be provided between the prime mover control point, drive machinery\nbuilding if any, loading stations, and unloading stations. The communication\nsystem shall be functional and audible during operation. On lifts\ninstalled prior to 1995, radiophones or suitable public address systems may be\nused. Audio indicators shall be audible over all ambient noise\nlevels, and visual indicators (e.g., Light Emitting Diodes) shall be visible\neven in bright sunlight. NOTE - Voice communication systems are not required for\nthose tows qualifying for operation by a single operator, as defined in\n6.3.2.2. ANSI B77, Section 6.1.1.9.2 Unloading\nareas\n\nThe unloading areas length, profile, and exit pathway\nshall be installed in accordance with the tow's speed, usage and manufacturer's\nrecommendations. The exit pathway [should]\nshall\nbe inclined\ndownward in the direction of travel and outward from the line of the uphill tow\npath to provide passenger movement away from the tow. ANSI B77, Section 6.1.1.11.1 Acceptance\ninspection\n\nBefore a tow that is new or relocated or that has not\nbeen operated for routine maintenance within the previous 2 years is opened to\nthe public, it shall be given a thorough inspection by [qualified personnel]\nthe Commissioner\nto verify compliance with the plans and\nspecifications of the designer. ANSI B77, Section 6.1.1.11.2 Acceptance\ntests\n\nBefore a tow that is new or relocated or that has not\nbeen operated for routine maintenance within the previous 2 years is opened to\nthe public, it shall be given thorough tests by qualified personnel to verify\ncompliance with the plans and specifications of the designer. The designer or\nmanufacturer shall propose and submit an acceptance test procedure. The\n\nCommissioner shall be advised by the Owner 10 days prior to the date of the\ntest. ANSI B77, Section 6.1.2.8.1\n\nGeneral\n\nAll sheaves, including their mountings and frames, shall\nbe designed to withstand static and dynamic loads. Sheave bearings and\nmountings shall be selected, designed, and installed in accordance with the\nrecommendations of the manufacturers of the bearings. When unlined sheave\ngrooves are used for wire rope, they [should]\nshall\nbe\nV-shaped and shall have rounded bottoms with a radius equal to approximately\n55% of the rope diameter. When lined sheave grooves are used, the allowable bearing\npressures of the liner material shall not be exceeded. ANSI B77, Section 6.1.4.3 Towing\ndevices\n\nRope grippers for skiers shall not be permitted. Towing\ndevices shall be allowed on tows operating at 400 feet per minute (2.0 meters\nper second) or less. Towing devices shall be designed to prevent sliding along\nthe haul rope when subject to twice the pull required to move a passenger along\nthe tow path at the steepest point. The towing device shall be designed to\npreclude entangling gloves or clothing, or pinching fingers between the towing\ndevice and the haul rope. Attaching the towing device to the haul rope shall in\nno way impair the strength of the haul rope. The connection between the towing device and a\nrecreational device shall be designed to minimize inadvertent detachment due to\nline surges including stops and starts and [should]\nshall\nnot\nbe detached by passenger movements without their reaching the towing\ndevice. The designer shall specify the following relative to any\ntowing device: a)\n\nThe\nallowable loading to which the towing device may be subjected; b)\n\nThe specifications relating to how the\ntowing device is to be used, i.e. if it is designed for use with a recreational\ndevice; c)\n\nThe characteristics of\nthe connection details appropriate for the connection of the recreational\ndevice to the towing device.
