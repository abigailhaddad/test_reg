  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 137.2 - Special rules as to New York State sources\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 637(b)\n(a) In determining the sources (as either\nwithin or without New York State) of a nonresident partner's share of\npartnership income, no effect is given to a provision in a partnership\nagreement which characterizes payments to a partner as salary or other\nconsideration paid or distributable for services rendered to the partnership by\nthe partner, or as being interest or other consideration paid or distributable\nfor the use of capital of a partner. (b) Likewise, except where otherwise\nauthorized in accordance with section\n137.4\nof this\n\nPart, no effect is given to a provision in a partnership agreement which\nallocates to a nonresident partner, as income or gain from sources outside New\n\nYork State, a greater proportion of his distributive share of partnership\nincome or gain than the ratio of partnership income or gain form sources\noutside New York State to partnership income or gain from all sources. For\nexample, if the total distributive share of a nonresident partner from all\nsources is $5,000 and 60 percent of the partnership's income is from New York\n\nState sources, the nonresident partner is required to report on his New York\n\nState nonresident personal income tax return $3,000 (60 percent of $5,000) as\nhis distributive share of partnership income, even though, under the\npartnership agreement, his share of the total New York income of the\npartnership may have been fixed at less than $3,000. (c) Likewise, except where otherwise\nauthorized in accordance with section\n137.4\nof this\n\nPart, no effect is given to a provision in a partnership agreement which\nallocates to a nonresident partner a greater proportion of a particular\npartnership item of loss or deduction connected with New York State sources\nthan his proportionate share for Federal income tax purposes of partnership\nloss or deduction generally. For example, if the share of a nonresident partner\nof partnership losses in 50 percent for Federal income tax purposes, he is not\npermitted to deduct on his New York State nonresident personal income tax\nreturn more than 50 percent of any particular partnership loss or deduction\nconnected with New York State sources, regardless of any special provision of\nthe partnership agreement assigning a larger percentage of the specific loss or\ndeduction to him.
