  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2C.15 - Combination Horizontal Alignment/Advisory Exit and Ramp Speed Signs (W13-6 and W13-7)\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE Paragraph 01. INSERT the following paragraphs: Option: 00A A horizontal alignment sign (see Section\n2C.07\n) may be combined with an\n\nAdvisory Exit Speed or Advisory Ramp Speed sign to create a combination\n\nHorizontal Alignment/Advisory Exit Speed (W13-6) sign or a combination\n\nHorizontal Alignment/Advisory Ramp Speed (W13-7) sign (see Figure 2C-1). The\ncombination Horizontal Alignment/Advisory Exit Speed sign may be used where the\nseverity of the exit ramp curvature may not be apparent to road users in the\ndeceleration lane or where the curvature needs to be specifically identified as\nbeing on the exit ramp rather than on the mainline. The combination Horizontal\n\nAlignment/Advisory Ramp Speed sign may be used on a ramp that is not an exit\nramp, or for a curve that is on an exit ramp and is downstream of the initial\ncurve. 00B If a combination Horizontal Alignment/Advisory Exit\n\nSpeed sign or combination Horizontal Alignment/Advisory Ramp Speed sign us\nused, an Advisory Exit Speed Sign (W13-2), Advisory Ramp Speed Sign (W13-3), or\n\nHorizontal Alignment sign (see Section\n2C.07\n) is not required for the\nsame curve. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2C.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
