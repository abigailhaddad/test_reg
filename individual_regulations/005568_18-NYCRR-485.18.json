  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 485.18 - Personal and Compassionate Caregiving Visitation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section shall apply to all adult\ncare facilities, including every adult care facility regulated pursuant to\n\nParts 487, 488 and 490 of this Title and Part 1001 of Title 10 of the\nNYCRR. (b) Subject to the\nresident's right to deny or withdraw consent at any time, all adult care\nfacilities must provide immediate access to any resident of visitors of their\nchoice, including but not limited to immediate family or other relatives of the\nresident and any others who are visiting with the consent of the resident. Provided, however, that the facility may establish policies and procedures to\nestablish reasonable restrictions on such visitation, including but not limited\nto: setting forth visitation hours; denying access to any visitor suffering\nfrom a communicable disease; terminating visitation with any visitor causing a\nthreat to the health or safety of any resident; and setting a cap on the number\nof visitors allowed in the facility at any one time. Any such restrictions or\nlimitations on visitation shall be communicated in writing to\nresidents. (c) Personal caregiving\nvisitors. (1)\n\nDuring a public health emergency\ndeclared under section\ntwenty-four\nor\nsection\ntwenty eight\nof\nthe executive law, the facility must continue to allow residents to access\ntheir designated personal caregiving visitors, as defined in subdivision (1) of\nsection\n2801-h\nof\nthe Public Health Law, notwithstanding any restrictions or prohibitions\nrelating to residential health care facility visitation resulting from the\ndeclared public health emergency, subject to the following restrictions: (i) If a facility has reasonable cause to\nbelieve that a resident will not benefit from accessing their designated\npersonal caregiving visitors, and such reasoning has been documented in the\nresident's case management record, a facility may require a health or mental\nhealth professional duly licensed or certified in New York State under the\n\nEducation Law, and who is not associated with the facility, including but not\nlimited to a physician, registered nurse, licensed clinical social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist, to provide a written statement that the personal\ncaregiving will substantially benefit the resident's quality of life, including\na statement from such medical provider that the personal caregiving visitation\nwill enhance the resident's mental, physical, or psychosocial well-being, or\nany additional criteria evidencing a benefit to quality of life as determined\nby the Department. Such written statements shall be maintained in the\nresident's case management record. (ii)\n\nNotwithstanding any provision of this\nparagraph, a facility may temporarily suspend or limit personal caregiving\nvisitors to protect the health, safety and welfare of residents, if: the\ndeclared public health emergency is related to a communicable disease and the\n\nDepartment determines that local infection rates are at a level that presents a\nserious risk of transmission of such communicable disease within local\nfacilities; the facility is experiencing temporary inadequate staffing and has\nreported such staffing shortage to the Department of Health any other State or\nfederal agencies as required by law, regulation, or other directive; or an\nacute emergency situation exists at the facility, including loss of heat, loss\nof elevator service, or other temporary loss of an essential service. Provided, however, that in the event a facility suspends or limits personal caregiving\nvisitation pursuant to this subparagraph, the facility shall notify residents, all designated personal caregiving visitors, and the applicable Department\nregional office of such suspension or limitation and the duration thereof\nwithin twenty-four hours of implementing the visitation suspension or\nlimitation. Additionally, for each day of the suspension or limitation, the\nfacility shall document the specific reason for the suspension or limitation in\ntheir administrative records. The facility shall further provide a means for\nall residents to engage in remote visitation with their designated personal\ncaregiving visitor(s), including but not limited to phone or video calls, until\nsuch time that the suspension or limitation on personal caregiving visitation\nhas ended. (iii)\n\nNotwithstanding\nany provision of this paragraph, a facility may also prohibit a personal\ncaregiving visitor from entering if the facility has reasonable cause to\nbelieve that permitting the personal caregiving visitor to meet with the\nresident is likely to pose a threat of serious physical, mental, or\npsychological harm to such resident. In the event the facility determines that\ndenying such personal caregiving visitor access to the resident is in the\nresident's best interests pursuant to this subparagraph, the facility must\ndocument the date of and reason for visitation refusal in the resident's case\nmanagement record, and on the same date of the refusal the facility shall\ncommunicate its decision to the resident and their designated representative. Further, a facility may refuse access to or remove from the premises any\npersonal caregiving visitor who is causing or reasonably likely to cause\nphysical injury to any facility resident or personnel. (2)\n\nThe facility shall develop written\npolicies and procedures to ask residents, or their designated representatives\nin the event the resident lacks capacity, at time of admission or readmission, or for existing residents within fourteen days of the effective date of this\nparagraph, which individuals the resident elects to serve as their personal\ncaregiving visitor during declared local or state health emergencies. A\nresident shall be entitled to designate at least two personal caregiving\nvisitors at one time. (3)\n\nThe\nfacility shall maintain a written record of the resident's designated personal\ncaregiving visitors in the resident's case management record, and shall\ndocument when personal caregiving and compassionate caregiving is provided in\nthe case management record. (4)\n\nAs\npart of its ongoing review of a resident's case management needs, the facility\nshall regularly inquire of all current residents, or their designated\nrepresentative if the resident lacks capacity, whether the facility's current\nrecord of designated personal caregiving visitors remains accurate, or whether\nthe resident, or their designated representative if the resident lacks\ncapacity, wishes to make any changes to their personal caregiving visitor\ndesignations. The facility shall update the resident's case management record\nwith the date the facility sought updates from the resident and indicate any\nchanges to the resident's personal caregiving visitor designations therein. Such inquiries shall be made no less frequently than every six months and upon\na change in the resident's condition; upon review of a facility's visitation\npolicies and procedures, the Department may also require the facility inquire\nof any resident whether the facility's current record of designated personal\ncaregiving visitors remains accurate. (5)\n\nThe facility shall require all personal\ncaregiving visitors to adhere to infection control measures established by the\nfacility and consistent with any guidelines from the Department, or in the\nabsence of applicable Department guidance, consistent with long term care\nfacility infection control guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention. Such infection control measures may include, but need not be\nlimited to: (i) testing all personal\ncaregiving visitors for any communicable disease that is the subject of the\ndeclared public health emergency, which may include rapid on-site testing or\nrequiring the visitor to present a negative test result from no more than seven\ndays prior to the visit; (ii)\nchecking the personal caregiving visitor's body temperature upon entry to the\nfacility, and denying access to any visitor with a temperature above 100\ndegrees Fahrenheit; (iii)\nconducting health screenings of all personal caregiving visitors upon entry to\nthe facility, including screenings for signs and symptoms of any communicable\ndisease that is the subject of the declared public health emergency or any\nother communicable disease which is prevalent in the facility's geographic\narea, and recording the results of such screenings; (iv)\nrequiring all personal caregiving\nvisitors to don all necessary personal protective equipment appropriately, and\nproviding such personal protective equipment to all personal caregiving\nvisitors; and\n(v) enforcing social\ndistancing between persons during visitation, including personal caregiving\nvisitation, except as necessary to provide personal caregiving by the personal\ncaregiving visitor for the resident. (6)\n\nThe facility shall establish policies and\nprocedures regarding the frequency and duration of personal caregiving visits\nand limitations on the total number of personal caregiving visitors allowed to\nvisit the resident and the facility at any one time. Such policies shall not be\nconstrued to limit access by other visitors that would otherwise be permitted\nunder state or federal law or regulation. The facility shall ensure its\npolicies and procedures respect resident privacy and take into account\nvisitation protocols in the event a resident occupies a shared room. In\nestablishing frequency and duration limits, the facility policy shall ensure\nthat residents are able to receive their designated personal caregiving\nvisitors for the resident's desired frequency and length of time, and any\nrestrictions on that desired frequency and duration must be: (i) attributable to the resident's clinical\nor personal care needs; (ii)\nnecessary to ensure the resident's roommate has adequate privacy and space to\nreceive their own designated personal caregiving visitors; or\n(iii)\nbecause the desired visitation\nfrequency or duration would impair the effective implementation of applicable\ninfection control measures, including social distancing of at least six feet\nbetween the visitors and others in the facility, having sufficient staff to\neffectively screen all personal caregiving visitors and monitor visits to\nensure infection control protocols are being followed throughout, and having a\nsufficient supply of necessary personal protective equipment for all personal\ncaregiving visitors. (d) Compassionate caregiving. (1)\n\nIn the event a resident experiences a\nlong-term or acute physical, mental, or psychosocial health condition for\nwhich, in the opinion of the resident, their representative, or a health care\nprofessional (including but not limited to a physician, registered nurse, licensed clinical social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist), a\ncompassionate caregiving visitor would improve the resident's quality of life, the resident or their representative shall designate at least two compassionate\ncaregiving visitors at one time, and the facility shall record such designation\nin the resident's case management record. A resident's designated personal\ncaregiving visitors may also provide compassionate caregiving. (2)\n\nSituations in which a resident is\neligible for a compassionate caregiving visitor include but are not limited to\nthe following: (i) end of life; (ii)\nthe resident, who was living with their\nfamily before recently being admitted to an adult care facility, is struggling\nwith the change in environment and lack of physical family support; (iii)\nthe resident is grieving after a friend\nor family member recently passed away; (iv)\nthe resident needs cueing and\nencouragement with eating or drinking, and such cueing was previously provided\nby family and/or caregiver(s), and the resident is now experiencing weight loss\nor dehydration; and\n(v) the\nresident, who used to talk and interact with others, is experiencing emotional\ndistress, seldom speaking, or crying more frequently (when the resident had\nrarely cried in the past). (3)\n\nCompassionate caregiving visitation shall\nbe permitted at all times, regardless of any general visitation restrictions or\npersonal caregiving visitation restrictions in effect in the facility. Provided, however, that the facility shall require compassionate caregiving\nvisitors to be screened for communicable diseases prior to entering the\nfacility and visits must be conducted using appropriate social distancing\nbetween the resident and visitor if applicable based on guidance from the\n\nDepartment or the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; if, however, personal contact would be beneficial for the resident's well-being, the\nfacility shall establish policies and procedures to ensure such physical\ncontact follows appropriate infection prevention guidelines, including the\nvisitor's use of personal protective equipment and adhering to hand hygiene\nprotocols before and after resident contact, and that physical contact is\nlimited in duration. (e) The Department shall have discretion to review and require modifications to a\nfacility's personal caregiving visitation and compassionate caregiving\nvisitation policies and procedures to ensure conformity with subdivisions (c)\nand (d) of this section and any applicable visitation guidelines issued by the\n\nDepartment or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
