Tit. 9 § 7.2 - Executive order no. 2: establishing a state energy planning board and authorizing the creation and implementation of a state energy plan\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, decisions about how to meet the State's future\nenergy needs can have significant impacts on the environment, public health, public welfare, safety, mobility, quality and reliability of services, energy\ncosts, and the ability to maintain and grow the State's economy; and\nWHEREAS, the burning of fossil fuels is a major contributor\nto global climate change, which poses a serious threat to the environment and\nthe public health in New York State and elsewhere; and\nWHEREAS, issues such as energy diversity, dependence on\nimported energy and fuels, the burning of fossil fuels, global climate change, acid rain and other airborne pollutants, ground-level ozone buildup, increased\ndevelopment, increased transportation demand, and waste generation and disposal\nfrom energy production are significant issues affecting New York and should be\naddressed in a comprehensive State energy plan; and\nWHEREAS, discrete State actions and decision-making\nregarding energy resources should be based on clearly identified policies and\nlong-range energy planning objectives and strategies; and\nWHEREAS, the efficiency and effectiveness of government\ndecision-making can be enhanced by the use of objective analyses with respect\nto future energy needs, the identification of various options to meet those\nneeds, and a consideration of the environmental, health and economic impacts of\nthose options; and\nWHEREAS, the development, implementation, and periodic\nreview of a sensible comprehensive energy plan will enable the State to\ndetermine its future energy needs and facilitate a deliberate, efficient, and\ncost-effective means of meeting those needs; NOW, THEREFORE, I, DAVID A. PATERSON, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nlaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: 1.

A\nmajority of the members of the Board shall constitute a quorum, and all actions\nand recommendations of the Board shall require approval of a majority of the\ntotal members of the Board. 3. The\n\nBoard shall create a State Energy Plan (\"Energy Plan\"), which shall include the\nfollowing: (a) a statement of long-range\nenergy policy objectives and strategies appropriate to increase energy supply\nand reduce energy demand, considering factors such as: (i) diversity of fuel supplies; (ii)\nprotection of public health and safety; (iii)\nthe needs of vulnerable\ncommunities; (iv)\nconsumer cost\nimpacts; (v) the relative economic\ncompetitiveness of the State; (vi)\nthe State's natural resources, (vii)\nthe reduction of greenhouse gases; (viii)\nenergy conservation and\nefficiency; (ix)\nclean and\nrenewable energy resources; (x) the\nmaintenance of reliable electric and natural gas systems; and\n(xi)\nexisting energy policies and objectives, including the Statewide Transportation Plan and State Implementation\n\nPlan; (b) demand\nforecasts for periods up to 10 years for electricity, natural gas, coal, and\npetroleum products, which shall assess demand for the State, considering\nreasonably expected changes in demographic and economic activity, energy\nefficiency, and load management; (c) supply requirements for the State (and\nany appropriate regions thereof) which are needed to satisfy forecasted demand\nfor electricity, natural gas, coal, and petroleum products; (d) assessments of existing electric\ngeneration, transmission and distribution systems, fuel transmission\nfacilities, delivery and storage systems, and energy transport systems to meet\nthe resource supply requirements for electricity, natural gas, coal, and\npetroleum products over the forecast periods; (e) projections of energy prices over the\nforecast periods; (f) assessments\nof the costs, benefits, uncertainties, market potential and opportunities for\npromoting sustainable alternatives to traditional energy resources, including\nclean and renewable energy resources for electric generation and other energy\nrequirements, distributed generation technologies, cogeneration technologies, energy efficiencies, demand management, and biofuels which are reasonably\navailable for satisfying energy supply requirements; (g) assessments of the impacts associated\nwith electricity production and energy use on public health and the\nenvironment, including on communities that are burdened disproportionately by\nhealth and environmental impacts; (h) assessments of State environmental\npolicies and programs which impact the State's development and implementation\nof energy policy and programs; (i) an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions, and strategies for facilitating and\naccelerating the use of low carbon energy sources and/or carbon mitigation\nmeasures; (j) assessments of the\ncosts, benefits, and uncertainties of traditional and alternative\ntransportation measures required to meet system demands over the forecast\nperiods, including options, such as reduced vehicle miles traveled, to address\nthe energy, environmental and health impacts of using traditional and\nalternative fuels; (k) State energy\npolicies and programs intended to support economic growth in the State, including those intended to develop a clean energy economy; (l) comparison of energy prices for various\ncustomer classes provided by electric and natural gas utilities of the State\nwith those in other states that compete with New York for business; (m) the role of environmental justice\nconsiderations in energy-related decisions; (n) recommendations for administrative and\nlegislative actions to implement the policies, objectives, and strategies set\nforth in the Energy Plan; and\n(o) recommendations for the study of additional issues and/or for further study of\nissues addressed in the Energy Plan. 4.
