  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 3B.02 - No-Passing Zone Pavement Markings and Warrants\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE Paragraph 07. INSERT the following paragraphs: Support: 00A An order, ordinance, rule, or regulation pertaining to\nthe application of pavement markings in accordance with this manual is\nnecessary for no-passing zones to be \"official markings,\" as referred to in\n\nSection 1126(a) of the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law. Standard: 06A Yellow one-way or two way no-passing zone markings, as\nappropriate, shall connect no-passing zones when there is insufficient length\nfor unrestricted passing, (i.e. less than 400 feet between successive\nno-passing zones). Standard: 06B A no-passing zone for traffic in a particular direction\nshall be at least 400 feet in length. Where the actual no-passing distance is\nless than 400 feet, the additional length of yellow no-passing zone markings\nshall be added at the beginning of the zone. Support: 06C It is generally unnecessary to mark no-passing zones on\ntwo-lane, two-way urban highways. Speeds are generally low and, where markings\nare provided, the yellow broken centerline marking is usually\nsufficient. Standard: 06D Where used, the minimum length of a no-passing zone on\ntwo-lane, two-way urban highways shall be 200 feet. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n3B.02\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
