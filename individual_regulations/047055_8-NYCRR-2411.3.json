(1)\n\nAwards may be prepaid to educational\ninstitutions, for the benefit of eligible students who have submitted\napplications for awards, by means of a single check or electronic funds\ntransfer in an amount representing a percentage of the total amount of awards\nwhich would be payable if the educational institution certified to the\ncorporation the eligibility of every student appearing on the roster of\napplicants provided to the educational institution. Except as provided herein, prepayments shall be made no sooner than 30 days before the start of any term, and shall be made only for rosters or applicants for the summer term issued\nprior to September 30th, for the fall term issued prior to November 30th, for\nthe winter term issued prior to February 28th and for the spring term issued\nprior to April 30th of the academic year. Payments relating to rosters issued\nafter these dates shall be made by the lump sum payment method. The percentage\nto be utilized by the corporation for each institution for each term of the\nacademic year shall be determined by the president and, except as provided in\nsubdivision (d) of this section, shall be the percentage as determined by the\nfollowing calculation: (i) certified value of\neducational institution's rosters for the corresponding term of the prior\nacademic year which have been submitted to the corporation by a date to be\nestablished by the president, divided by: (ii)\nvalue of all rosters for the\ncorresponding term of the prior academic year submitted to the educational\ninstitution for certification at least 60 days prior to the date to be\nestablished by the president in accordance with subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. (2)\n\nThe\nprepayment to be made based upon the resultant percentage shall be determined\nby reference to the table below: When historical certification rate\nis\nTAP prepayment percentage\nis\n\nGreater than or equal\nto\nbut less than\n93%\n100%\n90%\n88%\n93%\n85%\n83%\n88%\n80%\n78%\n83%\n75%\n73%\n78%\n70%\n68%\n73%\n65%\n63%\n68%\n60%\n58%\n63%\n55%\n53%\n58%\n50%\n48%\n53%\n45%\n43%\n48%\n40%\n38%\n43%\n35%\n33%\n38%\n30%\n28%\n33%\n25%\n23%\n28%\n20%\n18%\n23%\n15%\n13%\n18%\n10%\n0%\n13%\n0%\n(3)\n\nIn the event that a new program is\ncreated in an existing educational institution and a separate payment plan is\nto be used for that new program, the prepayment percentage shall be the same\npercentage utilized for the existing educational institution or 75 percent\nwhichever is lower. Should the existing educational institution include more\nthan one program with different prepayment percentages, the prepayment for the\nnew program shall be the percentage for that program within the educational\ninstitution most closely associated with the new program or 75 percent, whichever is lower. (4)\n\nThe term\nprepayment percentages for each educational institution shall be recalculated\nfor each new academic year or when deemed necessary by the president pursuant\nto the provisions of this subdivision. After the educational institution's\ncertification of eligibility, additional payments, if any, shall be made to the\neducational institution, for the benefit of eligible students, or refunds of\noverpaid amounts shall be made by the educational institution to the\ncorporation. (c) Lump sum payment method. Awards may be paid to educational institutions, for the\nbenefit of eligible students, by means of a single check or electronic funds\ntransfer in an amount representing the value of awards to students whose\neligibility has been certified to the corporation by the educational\ninstitution. A single check will be issued, payable to the educational\ninstitution, after the corporation has received and reviewed the roster of\napplicants whose eligibility has been certified by the educational institution\nfor a term. (d) Disqualification from prepayment. The president, for good cause, may disqualify an\neducational institution from participating in the prepayment method set forth\nin subdivision (b) of this section or where the educational institution has a\nhistory of delinquency in refunding excess prepayments, reduce an educational\ninstitution's prepayment percentage to a rate lower than that determined by the\nmethod set forth in that subdivision. Good cause shall include revision of the\neducational institution's academic calendar or revision of the educational\ninstitution's programs of study where such revision has an effect upon the\ncalculation of the prepayment percentage, a finding of insufficient\nadministrative practices at the educational institution, the assertion of a\nclaim of refund from the educational institution pursuant to Part 2405 of this\n\nTitle, or other good cause established to the satisfaction of the president. A\ndisqualified educational institution shall be afforded an opportunity for a\nhearing within 30 days after such disqualification provided that a written\nrequest therefore is served on the corporation within 10 days of notice of such\ndisqualification.
