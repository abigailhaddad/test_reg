  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 233.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the\npurposes of this Part, the general definitions and requirements of Part 200 of\nthis Title shall apply. (b) For the\npurpose of this Part, the following definitions shall apply: (1)\n\nAnnual. Refers to a period of time based\nupon a calendar year commencing January 1st and terminating midnight December\n31st. (2)\n\nCondenser. A device which\ncools a gas stream to a temperature at which all or some of the vaporized\nvolatile organic compounds in the gas stream will condense and will be\nremoved. (3)\n\nCosmetic manufacturing\nprocess. Any process producing or blending chemicals for use in cosmetic\nproducts and/or manufacturing cosmetic products by chemical processes. Cosmetic\nproducts include, but are not limited to, colognes, perfumes, and nail\npolish. (4)\n\nControl system. Any\ncontrol devices, including, but not limited to condensers, which are designed\nand operated to reduce the quantity of contamiants, including but not limited\nto volatile organic compounds emitted to the atmosphere. (5)\n\nIn-process tank. Containers used for\nmixing, blending, heating, reacting, holding, crystallizing, evaporating or\ncleaning operations in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. (6)\n\nLower Orange County metropolitan area. The area including the towns of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick and Woodbury. (7)\n\nNew York City metropolitan area. All of the city of New York, and Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland Counties. (8)\n\nPharmaceutical manufacturing process. Any\nprocess involving the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and intermediates, including but not limited to, the following operations: (i) the manufacture of pharmaceutical\nproducts and intermediates by chemical synthesis; (ii)\nthe production and separation of\nmedicinal chemicals including, but not limited to, antibiotics and vitamins\nfrom microorganisms; (iii)\nthe\nmanufacture of botanical and biological products by the extraction of organic\nchemicals from vegetative materials or animal tissues; or\n(iv)\nthe formulation of pharmaceuticals into\nvarious dosage forms including, but not limited to, tablets, capsules, injectable solutions or ointments, that are to be taken by the patient\nimmediately and in accurate amounts. (9)\n\nPotential to emit. The maximum capacity\nof an air contamination source to emit any air contaminant under its physical\nand operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity\nof the facility or air contamination source to emit any air contaminant, including air pollution control equipment and/or restriction on the hours of\noperation, or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or processed\nshall be treated as part of the design only if the limitation is contained in\nenforceable permit conditions. Fugitive emissions, to the extent that they are\nquantifiable, are included in determining the potential to emit. (10)\n\nProduction equipment exhaust system. A\ndevice for collecting and directing volatile organic compound fugitive\nemissions from reactor openings, centrifuge openings, and other vessel openings\nout of the work area for the purpose of protecting workers from exposure and/or\nto reduce vapor concentrations below the lower explosive limit. (11)\n\nReactor. A vat or vessel, which may be\njacketed to permit temperature control, designed to control chemical\nreactions. (12)\n\nSeparation\noperation. A process that separates a mixture of compounds, including liquids\nand/or solids into two or more components. Specific mechanisms include\nextraction, centrifugation, filtration and crystallization. (13)\n\nSynthesized pharmaceutical manufacturing\nprocess. Any process involving the manufacture of pharmaceutical products and\nintermediates by chemical synthesis. The production and recovery of materials\nproduced via fermentation, extraction of organic chemicals from vegetative\nmaterials or animal tissues, and formulation and packaging of the product are\nnot considered to be synthesized pharmaceutical manufacturing\nprocesses. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n233.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
