  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 491.9 - Referrals and assessments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Referrals. Any homeless adult who applies to a social services\ndistrict for temporary housing assistance may be considered for referral to a\nshelter for adults or a small-capacity shelter; and, any homeless adult family\nthat applies to a social services district for temporary housing assistance may\nbe considered for referral to a shelter for adult families. A homeless adult\nfamily may not be referred to a shelter for adults or a small-capacity shelter\nunless the family can be provided with an individual room with a door\ncontaining a working door lock and with the minimum square footage per family\nmember as required by the applicable State or local regulation or\ncode. (b) Assessments. (1)\n\nWhen an\nindividual adult or adult family applies for temporary housing assistance, the\nsocial services district or the social services district's designee shall\ncommence to evaluate the adult or adult family to assess the individual adult's\nor the adult family's housing and housing-related public assistance and care\nneeds pursuant to section\n352.35\nof this Title, and the\nsuitability of the individual adult or adult family for placement in a shelter, by the end of the next business day. The assessment shall be completed by the\nsocial services district or its designee as soon as possible\nthereafter. (2)\n\nAn individual or\nadult family must cooperate in and complete an assessment. When an individual\nor family fails to cooperate in and complete the assessment, the social\nservices district must deny the individual's or family's application for\ntemporary housing assistance unless non-compliance is due to a physical or\nmental impairment. When such a physical or mental impairment appears to be\npresent and interfering with an individual's ability to cooperate in and\ncomplete an assessment, the social services district must refer the individual\nor the family member with the apparent physical or mental impairment for an\nevaluation by an appropriate professional. When an individual states that they\nhave a physical or mental impairment that interferes with their compliance, they must provide documentation of this impairment, unless the physical or\nmental impairment is known or apparent to shelter or intake staff, in which\ncase the individual shall not be required to provide documentation of the\nphysical or mental impairment. If they do not have such documentation and\ncannot obtain it with or without the assistance of the social services\ndistrict, the social services district may refer the individual to an\nappropriate qualified professional for an evaluation and/or for such\ndocumentation. The social services district also may refer the individual to an\nappropriate qualified professional for an independent medical examination if\nthe social services district believes additional information is necessary to\nconfirm that the individual has a physical or mental impairment that is\ninterfering with their ability to cooperate in and complete an\nassessment. (c) A social\nservices district shall not, without the approval of the office, place any\nperson in a shelter for adults, a small-capacity shelter, or a shelter for\nadult families who: (1)\nhas a mental or\nphysical condition that makes such placement inappropriate or otherwise may\ncause danger to himself/herself or others; (2)\nrequires services beyond those that the\nshelter is authorized to provide by law and regulation, and by an operational\nplan approved by the office; (3)\nis\nlikely to substantially interfere with the health, safety, welfare, care or\ncomfort of other residents; (4)\nis\nin need of a level of medical, mental health, nursing care or other assistance\nthat cannot be rendered safely and effectively by the facility, or that cannot\nbe reasonably provided by the facility through the assistance of other\ncommunity resources; (5)\nis\nincapable of ambulation on stairs without personal assistance, unless such a\nperson can be assigned a room on a floor with ground level egress or the\nfacility is equipped with an elevator; (6)\nhas a generalized systemic communicable\ndisease or a readily communicable local infection which cannot be properly\nisolated and quarantined in the facility. (d) When a person cannot be referred to a\nshelter for adults, a small-capacity shelter, or a shelter for adult families\nfor any of the reasons set forth in subdivision (c) of this section, the social\nservices district must ensure that action is taken which is appropriate to the\nhealth, safety and needs of that person. Such action may include, but is not\nlimited to, referral for appropriate medical or clinical services where a\nperson is determined to be in need of treatment for physical or mental health\nissues, or to an appropriate adult protective or law enforcement agency or\nsimilar entity.
