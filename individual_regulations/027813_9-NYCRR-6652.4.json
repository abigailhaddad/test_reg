  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6652.4 - Area agency procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An area agency shall have and follow\nwritten procedures to carry out its functions. These procedures shall describe\nthe process by which the area plan approved under this Chapter is developed, the composition and role of the advisory council, methods for determining which\nelderly people will receive each service under the plan, and procedures for\nresolution of complaints from elderly people or service providers dissatisfied\nwith area agency actions or decisions. (b) An area agency shall develop and publish\nits methods for establishing priorities among services, particularly for\naccess, in-home, and legal assistance services. (c) An area agency shall establish procedures\ngoverning outreach, training and coordination activities of service providers\nunder the area plan. (d) An area\nagency shall develop procedures to maximize services funded from other sources. No OAA, CSE, or EISEP funds may be used to provide services to any elderly\nperson eligible to receive the same or substantially similar services available\nto that person under title XVIII, XIX, or XX of the Federal Social Security\n\nAct, or to residents of adult residential care facilities who are receiving or\nare entitled by law to receive the same or substantially similar services from\nthat facility. (e) An area agency\nshall ensure that all its procedures enhance the targeting of services\n(including coordination of services provided by other agencies) to elderly who\nare low-income (with incomes below the poverty line), minority, frail, or\nvulnerable. (f) If it appears that\nan applicant for OAA, CSE or EISEP services or funding may be eligible to\nreceive the same or similar services under title XVIII, XIX or XX of the\n\nFederal Social Security Act, or is a resident of adult residential care\nfacilities who is receiving or may be entitled by law to receive the same or\nsubstantially similar services from that facility, the area agency must assist\nsuch applicant in obtaining such services from such other source, except that\nthe area agency may provide or arrange for the provision of services to such\nindividual if the area agency has in effect an agreement providing for\nreimbursement from the appropriate funding source for services so provided to\nindividuals eligible for assistance from such other source. Nothing herein\nshall be construed to require that OAA, CSE or EISEP services be denied to an\notherwise eligible elderly person while a determination of eligibility for the\nabove-mentioned services is under review by the proper agencies; provided that\nthe area agency shall ensure that arrangements have been made to secure\nreimbursement from the appropriate funding source once such determination has\nbeen made. (g) The OAA shall ensure\nequal access for participation, services, activities and informational sessions\nwithout regard to partisan affiliation; refrain from using funds to advance any\npartisan candidate or effort (yet permit equal access and opportunities for all\ncandidates/encumbents when providing information on the political process to\nthe elderly); prevent the use of official authority, influence, or coercion to\ninterfere with or affect elections or nominations for office; and ensure no\ncoercion is used nor advice given to other people to contribute anything of\nvalue to a party, committee, organization, agency, or person for political\npurposes, nor engage in sectarian or partisan activities. (h) Under EISEP, an area agency shall provide\nto any service recipient or applicant who contests a determination by the area\nagency concerning functional eligibility (which includes the existence of unmet\nneeds in order to determine program eligibility) or extent of cost sharing, an\nopportunity for a hearing (provided, however, that despite functional\neligibility, an area agency may deny services to applicants based on lack of\nprogram resources, and further provided that no entitlement to services is\ncreated under this Chapter). A service recipient or applicant may request such\na hearing from the area agency verbally (in which case it must be documented by\nthe area agency) or in writing within 30 days following receipt of notice of\nthe contested action (except that the area agency may waive such deadline upon\ngood cause). The hearing shall include the right to be assisted in contesting\nsuch denials of assistance or levels of required cost-sharing. The area agency\nshall complete the hearing and issue a hearing decision within 60 days of the\ndate the request for hearing was received by the area agency. The area agency\nmust send a copy of the decision to the office within five business days of its\nissuance. The area agency may terminate formal hearing procedures at any point\nif the disputed issues are resolved by negotiated agreement approved by the\noffice. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
