  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 196.2 - Branding and marking\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Grade. The law requires that all closed packages of grapes be marked prior to\nshipment either with the word \"unclassified\" or else with one of the grade\ndesignations which have been officially established by the Commissioner of\n\nAgriculture and Markets, namely: \"U.S. Fancy Table Grapes,\" \"U.S. No. 1 Table\n\nGrapes,\" \"U.S. No. 1 Juice Grapes,\" or any of these grade designations with the\nword \"Mixed\" added. This marking shall be placed in a conspicuous position on\nan irremovable part of the container--on the side or end of the package, or on\nthe handle of a climax basket if the handle is of wood. (b) Net contents. (1)\n\nThe required mark to indicate net\nquantity of the contents in terms of weight or measure must be placed on an\nirremovable part of the container--on the side or end of the package, or on the\nhandle of a climax basket if the handle is of wood. (2)\n\nIf the net quantity be stated in terms of\nmeasure, the package must be packed fully and firmly, so that the\nrepresentation of quantity will be accurate at each sale and re-sale of the\npackage. (c) Name. The\nrequired mark to indicate the name and address of the person or association\nunder whose authority the grapes are packed shall be placed on the cover of the\nbasket, if a solid cover is used. In case a slat cover is used, this mark may\neither be placed on the cover or may appear on the upper surface of a printed\nlabel laid on top of the grapes underneath the cover. (d) Method of marking. All marking must be\nplainly and legibly done and may be accomplished by means of a rubber stamp or\nby a printed label firmly affixed (except in the case of slat covers as\nprovided in the preceding subdivision) to the cover of the basket. (e) Time of marking. The law requires that\nmarking be done \"prior to shipment.\" When grapes are moved from the farm to\nsome other place and then transferred to another conveyance, such as a railroad\ncar, motor truck, or other medium of transportation, for final movement to\nmarket, they may either be marked at the farm or may be marked at the time of\ntransfer to the final medium of transportation. If moved direct from the farm\nto market, by motor truck or other vehicle, they must be marked prior to\nleaving the farm. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n196.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
