(ii)\n\nProject requiring inclusion in the\ncomprehensive plan. Any project that in accordance with section 11 or section\n13.1 of the Delaware River Basin Compact and DRBC regulations must be added to\nthe Comprehensive Plan (also, \"Plan\").

The fee\nshall be based on the amount of a project's approved monthly water allocation\nand/or approved daily discharge capacity.

The executive director shall inform the project sponsor in\nwriting when the alternative review fee is to be applied and may require\nadvance payment in the amount of the commission's projected costs. Instances in\nwhich the alternative review fee may apply include, but are not limited to, matters in which: (i) DRBC staff perform a\ndetailed pre-application review, including but not limited to the performance\nor review of modeling and/or analysis to identify target limits for wastewater\ndischarges.
