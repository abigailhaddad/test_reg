Codes R. & Regs. tit. 4, Appendices, app 4\n\nState Regulations\nSUMMARY OF THE RULES\nOF\nTHE PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT RELATIONS BOARD\nINTRODUCTION\nThe following is a summary of the Rules adopted under\nprovisions of the Public Employees' Fair Employment Act (Taylor Law). This\nsummary is designed to help public employers, public employees and employee\norganizations understand their responsibilities and rights under the Act. As\nsuch, it summarizes relevant aspects of the Act and of the Rules adopted by the\n\nNew York State Public Employment Relations Board. The criteria adopted by the Board (e.g., those relating to the\nrequirements for the filing of petitions and to showings of interest) need not\nbe adopted by impartial agencies operating under provisions of the Act which\nauthorize local governments to enact their own procedures. The Taylor Law and the Rules of the Board: [*] Give public employees the right to join or refrain from\njoining any employee organization; [*] Give public employees the right to be represented by\nemployee organizations of their own choosing and to negotiate collectively with\ntheir public employers; [*] Allow for the designation of persons as \"managerial\" or\n\"confidential\"; [*] Require public employers to negotiate with the duly\nrecognized or certified representatives of their employees and to enter into\nwritten agreements with them; [*] Oblige public employers and employee organizations to\nrefrain from \"improper practices\" which deny to employees rights granted by the\n\nAct; [*] Establish impasse procedures for the resolution of disputes\nin negotiations in the public sector; [*] Prohibit strikes by public employees. Fundamental to the exercise of these rights is the selection of\norganizations to represent employees in collective negotiations. The selection\nof such organizations involves two basic issues: the determination of an\nappropriate negotiating unit, and the determination of the employee\norganization which will represent the public employees in the unit determined\nto be appropriate. These determinations may be made jointly by a public employer\nand its public employees so long as they are not disputed. The designation of\nan employee organization as negotiating agent in this manner is called\nrecognition. Where the representation status of an employee organization is\nchallenged or when the public employer does not grant recognition after\nreceiving a request for recognition from an employee organization, the question\ninvolved must be resolved by the Public Employment Relations Board or by a\nlocal impartial agency in accordance with provisions and procedures established\nby the local government under sections\n206.1\nor 212 of the Act. In the\nabsence of established local government procedures under sections\n206.1\nor 212 of the Act, or when\nthe procedures established under section\n206.1\ndo not provide for resolution\nof disputes by an impartial agency (both of these sections are discussed in\nthis summary), questions regarding the selection of employee organizations will\nbe resolved by PERB in accordance with its own Rules. REPRESENTATION PROCEEDINGS\nWhen confronted with a request for recognition by one employee\norganization, an employer must initially resolve the two basic issues cited\nabove: the appropriateness of the unit and the status of the employee\norganization. If the employer, after deciding upon what it believes to be the\nappropriate unit for collective negotiations, determines that the employee\norganization involved represents the employees it claims to represent within\nthat unit, it should grant recognition to that employee organization. If there\nis no dissent from this determination, there is no need for PERB to become\ninvolved. A question concerning representation may be brought before the Board\nin the following ways: [*] By a public employer who has received a request for\nrecognition. [*] By a public employer seeding a determination that certain\nof its employees are managerial or confidential --Such an employer may file an\napplication with PERB from the first day of the fourth month through the last\nday of the fifth month after the commencement of its fiscal year. [*] No response by the public employer to a request for\nrecognition --In the event that the public employer makes no response to a\nrequest for recognition, the party seeking recognition may, after thirty days\nand within sixty days, file a petition for certification with PERB. [*] Refusal by the public employer to grant recognition\n--Within thirty days thereafter, a petition for certification may be filed with\nPERB by the party which is refused recognition by the public employer. [*] There is objection to the public employer's recognition of\nan employee organization --A petition for certification and/or decertification\nmay be filed by, or on behalf of a competing employee organization, or a\npetition for decertification may be filed by am employee or group of employees, which has reason to believe that there has been an error either in\nestablishment of the negotiating unit or in granting recognition. This petition\nmust be filed within thirty days after the employer has posted and published\nnotice that it has granted recognition to an employee organization. Such\nposting and publication are required immediately after the granting of\nrecognition. Upon the expiration of the period during which an employee\norganization is entitled to unchallenged representation statue--A petition for\ncertification or decertification may be filed during the thirty days preceding\nthe expiration of this period. PROCESSING OF PETITIONS BY PERB\nOnce a petition is filed with PERB, it will be reviewed by the\n\nDirector. 1. Appropriate negotiating\nunit --It is recognized that in many cases different parties may be able to\nargue with varying degrees of logic that different units are appropriate. The\ncomplexity of this issue was recognized by the Legislature, which included in\nthe Taylor Law a mandate for continuous study of the question. The Act does, however, set forth the following criteria for determination of an appropriate\nunit: (a) Community of interest --This is a\nmost significant element that must be considered in determining the appropriate\nunit in a particular case. The following will be important in this regard: whether the employees sought to be grouped together are subject to common\nworking rules, personnel practices, environment or salary and benefit\nstructure. A helpful question to ask is whether any real conflict of interest\nexists among the employees in the proposed unit. (b) Power to reach agreement --Briefly, this\nmeans that the agent of the public employer who would ordinarily deal with the\nproposed unit should have the power to act effectively concerning the terms and\nconditions of employment to be negotiated. (c) Responsibilities to the public --The\nproposed unit must be compatible with the joint responsibilities of the public\nemployer and the employees to serve the public. This criterion means that a\nproposed negotiating unit might be inappropriate if its structure and\ncomposition were found to interfere with providing a service to the public. It\ntakes into consideration the administrative convenience of the employer and\nsuggests that an excessive number of units is undesirable. On the other hand, too large a unit would preclude meaningful and effective negotiations. To summarize, the following criteria, among others, are\nconsidered in determining the appropriate negotiating unit in each particular\ncase: (a) the manner in which wages\nand other terms of employment are determined; (b) the method of job and salary\nclassification; (c) interdependence of jobs and interchange of employees; (d) the desires of employees (this is\nindicative of a felt community of interest); (e) past practices regarding organization and\nnegotiations; (f) the manner in\nwhich the employer is organized to do his job; (g) occupational differences; and\n(h) the number of employee organizations with\nwhich the employer might have to negotiate. 2. Showing of interest --At the outset of the\nproceeding, it will be determined administratively whether the employee\norganization involved has the support of a sufficient number of employees in\nfiling the petition to warrant further processing of the petition. In making\nthis determination, the following showing of interest requirements will be\napplied unless the petitioner or intervenor is a public employer. (a) In cases where there has been no response\nby the public employer to the demand for recognition, where the employer has\nexpressly refused to grant recognition, or where the period of unchallenged\nrepresentation of an employee organization is expiring, a showing of interest\nof 30% of the employees in the unit alleged to be appropriate shall be\nrequired. (b) In cases where the\npetitioner is seeking to review a decision by a public employer to voluntarily\nrecognize an employee organization, a showing of interest of 10% of the\nemployees in the unit deemed appropriate by the employer or alleged to be\nappropriate by the petitioner shall be required. (c) Where an employee organization is seeking\nto intervene in a representation proceeding, a showing of interest of 10% of\nthe employees in the unit already claimed to be appropriate or alleged to be\nappropriate by the employee organization seeking intervention shall be\nrequired. Ordinarily, the accepted indicia of a showing of interest are\nevidence of dues deduction authorizations which have not been revoked, evidence\nof current membership, designation cards or petitions which were signed and\ndated within six months of the filing of the petition, or a combination of\nthese. 3. Exclusivity --If an employee organization becomes an exclusive negotiating\nagent, it must represent all employees within the negotiating unit, whether or\nnot such employees are members of the organization. It should be noted that\nemployees cannot be required to join any employee organization. 4. Certification by PERB without an election\n--If the choice available to the employees in a negotiating unit is limited to\nthe selection or rejection of a single employee organization, that choice may\nbe ascertained on the basis of dues deduction authorizations which have not\nbeen revoked, or by individual designation cards which have been executed\nwithin six months prior to the certification, or by a combination of\nboth. 5. Certification by PERB\nafter an election --If an election is held, it will be by secret ballot and if\nan employee organization is found by PERB to represent a majority of those\neligible employees who cast valid ballots, that employee organization will be\ncertified as the negotiating agent. 6. Interference with representation\nprocedures --Conduct by any party that prejudices the right of public employees\nto form, join and participate in or to refrain from forming, joining and\nparticipating in concerted activities on behalf of any employee organization of\ntheir own choosing will be grounds for setting aside the results of a\nrepresentation election. If such conduct is determined to have taken place\nafter the filing of a petition in a representation proceeding before PERB, objections nay be filed within five working days after final results of the\nelection have been furnished by PERB to the parties. The objections then will\nbe investigated, hearings will be held, if necessary and the representation\nelection will be set aside if it is determined that there is merit to the\nobjections. RIGHTS OF A CERTIFIED OR RECOGNIZED EMPLOYEE\nORGANIZATION\nOnce an employee organization has been either recognized or\ncertified, it is extended the right to: [*] Represent the employees within the unit in negotiations and\nin settlement of grievances; [*] Check-off upon presentation to the employer of check-off\nauthorization cards signed by individual employees; and\n[*] Unchallenged representation status for the period provided\nin section\n208.2\nof the Act. IMPROPER PRACTICES\nPERB has exclusive jurisdiction to prevent improper employer\nand improper employee organization practices throughout the State, except that\nthe New York City Office of Collective Bargaining may presently also exercise\nthis authority in its jurisdiction. The Act prohibits a public employer from\ninterfering with the exercise of the rights which it grants to public\nemployees; it prohibits a public employer from dominating or interfering with\nthe internal affairs of any employee organization and requires every public\nemployer to negotiate in good faith with recognized and certified\nrepresentatives of its public employees. Employee organizations are also\nrequired to negotiate in good faith and are prohibited from interfering with or\ncoercing public employees in the exercise of rights granted by the Taylor\n\nLaw. Charges that a public employer or an employee organization is\nguilty of an improper practice may be filed within four months thereof by any\npublic employee, an employee organization or a public employer. The person, employee organization or government issuing the charge will be responsible for\nprosecuting it. LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROCEDURES UNDER SECTION\n206.1\nOF THE ACT\nUnder this section, which does not apply to the State or State\npublic authorities, local public employers may adopt procedures for resolving\nrepresentation disputes if such procedures are \"not inconsistent\" with the\nstandards of section 207 of the Act. These procedures are to be adopted by the\npublic employer's legislative body and require appropriate consultation with\ninterested parties. If such procedures provide for the use of an impartial\nagency to resolve local representation disputes, PERB will conduct, upon\nreceipt of a petition filed in timely fashion under Part 202 of these Rules, a\nlimited review concerned only with whether the procedures established are\nconsistent with the provisions of sections\n206.1\nand 207 of the Act and\npertinent sections of these Rules, whether the procedures have been followed, and whether the decision reached by the impartial agency is repugnant to the\n\nTaylor Law. If there is procedural regularity, and no repugnancy exists, PERB's\nrole will cease. If an impartial agency is not used, PERB may review the\nproceeding de novo. An impartial agency, as used in this context and with regard to\nsection 212 of the Act, means an agency independent of the local government and\nwithout predisposition or appearance of predisposition to favor such local\ngovernment or any employee organization. LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROCEDURES UNDER SECTION 212 OF THE ACT\nUnder section 212 of the Act, the legislature of a local\ngovernment may enact a complete set of provisions and procedures for resolving\nrepresentation disputes and settling impasses arising in the course of\ncollective negotiations and procedures for penalizing employee organizations\nwhich violate the strike prohibition of the Act. These provisions and\nprocedures, before being implemented, must be found by PERB to be substantially\nequivalent to the provisions and procedures of the Act and these Rules. Among\nother things, PERB requires that the administration of the local provisions and\nprocedures be by an impartial agency. The local enactment must also provide\nthat (a) the effective date of repeal, if any, shall be not less than sixty\ndays after notice of the repeal has been given to PERB, and (b) no amendment be\neffective until PERB finds that the provisions and procedures as amended are\nsubstantially equivalent to the provisions and procedures of the Act and these\n\nRules. If PERB determines that the local enactment is substantially\nequivalent, the impartial agency created thereby will stand in the stead of\nPERB and its actions will be reviewable by PERB only to insure that the\ncontinued implementation of the local provisions and procedures is\nsubstantially equivalent to the provisions and procedures of the Act and these\n\nRules. IMPASSE\nSection 209 of the Taylor Law provides that public employers\nand recognized or certified employee organizations may enter into written\nagreements setting forth procedures to be invoked if disputes between them\nreach an impasse during the course of collective negotiations. These written\nagreements may be incorporated in a general, collectively negotiated contract, or may be separate written agreements for the limited purpose of resolving\nparticular disputes. If the agreed-upon machinery for resolving disputes breaks\ndown, or if the parties fail to agree upon such procedures, PERB is obliged to\ninvoke the procedures detailed in section 209, subdivision 3 of the Act. Section 209 of the Taylor Law also provides that public\nemployers may agree to submit unresolved issues to arbitration. If requested by\nboth parties to a dispute, PHRB will furnish an arbitrator, provided that the\nparties are not subject to the jurisdiction of an agency established by a local\ngovernment pursuant to section 212 of the Act. The Director of Conciliation\nwill adopt procedures which give the parties an opportunity to participate in\nthe selection of the arbitrator. GRIEVANCES\nA negotiated agreement may provide for arbitration for the\nresolution of grievances. The Public Employment Relations Board maintains a\npanel of arbitrators who are available to service parties to a grievance\ndispute at the expense of the parties. STRIKES AGAINST A PUBLIC EMPLOYER\nSection\n210.1\nof the Act makes it unlawful\nfor any employee or an employee organization to engage in, cause, instigate, encourage or condone a strike. A charge that section\n210.1\nis being, or has been, violated by an employee organization may be made by the chief legal officer of\nthe government involved or by the Counsel to PERB upon his own motion. A\nhearing will then be held by the Board to determine whether there is merit to\nthe charge. One of the points of inquiry, if raised by the employee\norganization, will be whether the public employer or its representatives\nengaged in such acts of extreme provocation as to detract from the\nresponsibility of the employee organization for any strike that may be found to\nhave existed. The penalty which the Board may impose if it finds a violation of\nsection\n210.1\nis that it may order\nforfeiture of the employee organization's right to dues check-off for a\nspecified period of time or for an indefinite period of time subject to\nrestoration upon application supported by proof that the employee organization\nno longer asserts the right to strike against any government.
