  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 606.4 - Service disconnections\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where a telephone corporation disconnects services for nonpayment of charges, basic local telephone service may be disconnected only for nonpayment of basic\nlocal telephone service charges. Nonpayment of charges for other services\n(including long distance services provided by local exchange telephone\ncorporations, interexchange telephone corporations, and resellers, and\nnonregulated services offered by information providers) will not be cause for\ndisconnection of local exchange service if charges for local exchange services\nhave been paid but may result in denial or blocking of the service from the\nindividual provider for which payment has not been received where such blocking\nis technically feasible, or denial or blocking of the class of services from\nall providers where the selective blocking is not technically feasible. The\ntechnical capability to block service from an individual provider shall be\nattained as soon as practicable. (b) When nonpayment of charges for basic\nlocal telephone service would result in the disconnection of the service, the\nlocal exchange corporation shall adhere to the procedures specified in Part 609\nof this Title. (c) When nonpayment\nof charges for regulated nonbasic or optional features or long distance calls\nwarrants the denial or blocking of such services, the local exchange telephone\ncorporation may implement such denial or blocking of the services and shall\nadhere to the procedures specified in Part 609 of this Title. (d) The denial or blocking of regulated\nnonbasic or optional long distance and information features and services may\nnot have the effect of restricting a customer's ability to access emergency\nservices by dialing 911 or operator. (e) Every telephone corporation shall develop\na plan detailing how a customer's undesignated partial payments will be\nassigned among the services billed and how nonpayment of other charges on bills\nwill affect the customer's services. A customer's monthly statement will list, separately, the charges for each service and show any balance due for the\nservice. Further, each telephone corporation shall develop outreach and\neducation programs to advise customers of the assignment plan and the\nprotections against disconnection of services. The assignment plan, revised\nbill format and outreach and education program shall be submitted to the\ncommission for approval. The outreach and education program shall be approved\nso long as it reasonably conveys to telephone customers the new information set\nout in this rule through bill inserts, presentations, advertisements, or other\ninformation programs.
