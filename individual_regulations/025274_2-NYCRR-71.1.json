  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 71.1 - Report of open estates\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Whenever\nthe estate of a decedent is being administered by a public administrator\npursuant to article 12 of the Surrogate's Court Procedure Act or by a chief\nfiscal officer of a county who either is appointed administrator of an estate\npursuant to section\n1219\nof the Surrogate's Court Procedure Act\nor is acting as voluntary administrator pursuant to article 13 of the\n\nSurrogate's Court Procedure Act, and such estate has not been fully distributed\nnor a final accounting filed with petition for settlement with the appropriate\n\nSurrogate's Court, the estate representative shall annually in the month of\n\nJanuary file a report of open estates with the Office of the State Comptroller, covering every open estate in which permanent letters were issued to such\nrepresentative or in which an affidavit has been filed by such representative\npursuant to section\n1304\nof the Surrogate's Court Procedure\n\nAct, on or before the preceding December 31st. The report of open estates shall\nbe prepared on a form prescribed by the Office of the State Comptroller and\nshall require the name of the estate, the date letters were granted or\naffidavit filed, the amount of the gross estate, the amount undistributed, reasons why the final distribution of the estate has not been made, the\nanticipated estate closing date and such additional information as the State\n\nComptroller may deem warranted. If there are no such open estates, a report\nmust, nevertheless, be filed by the public administrator of chief fiscal\nofficer indicating that no estates are open. As used in this Part, the term\npublic administrator shall mean the public administrator of any county in which\nthe office of public administrator exists or any deputy public administrator or\nother individual who is performing the duties of the public administrator as\nprovided for by law. (b) Where a\nchief fiscal officer acting as administrator leaves office, resigns, or is\nremoved from office, a report must be filed by the former administrator within\n30 days from the date of leaving office, resignation or removal from office. In\nthe event of the death or incapacity of the administrator, the report must be\nfiled by the legal representative(s), if any, of the former administrator\nwithin 60 days of the appointment of such representative. A copy of any such\nreport must also be filed with the successor in office to the chief fiscal\nofficer. If there are no open estates, a report must, nevertheless, be filed by\nthe legal representative(s), if any, of the former chief fiscal officer\nindicating that no estates are open. (c) Failure to timely file any report\nprovided for herein will be considered by the Comptroller as grounds for\npetitioning the surrogate of the county having jurisdiction, praying for a\njudicial settlement of the accounts of any such public administrator or chief\nfiscal officer of a county, pursuant to the provisions of section\n8\n(11)\nof the State Finance Law. (d) The periods set forth in subdivisions (a)\nand (b) of this section are not intended to set a standard time for completion\nof estate administration, but rather to fix the times within which the\n\nComptroller is to be informed of the status of open estates and to fix a period\nafter which the Comptroller may inquire. (e) This section shall not limit the power of\nthe appropriate Surrogate's Court to direct an accounting at any time on its\nown initiative or on petition pursuant to section\n2205\nof the Surrogate's Court Procedure\n\nAct. (f) No open estate shall be\nexcluded from the applicability of the provisions of this section by virtue of\nthe fact that permanent letters of administration were issued to the public\nadministrator or chief fiscal officer acting as administrator prior to the\neffective date of this regulation.
