  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 1700.9 - Investigation report\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe object of the claims investigation shall be an impartial\nand thorough determination of facts. The investigator shall complete the \"claim\ninvestigation report\" (form 1422) and: (a) thoroughly and impartially examine the\ninmate's assertions; (b) determine\nwhether the inmate's statements are wholly or partially supported by any other\nevidence; (c) question all persons\nwho could reasonably have information pertinent to the determination of facts\nincluding facility staff, inmate claimant, other inmates, visitors, any\nwitnesses, and any other persons who might have any information germane to the\ninvestigation. Signed and dated statements should be taken from all individuals\nquestioned and included in the record; (d) determine whether the inmate secured the\npersonal property appropriately and whether the inmate contributed to the loss\nin any way; (e) determine where the\nproperty was at the time of loss and who was responsible for the property at\nthe time, and obtain a signed statement from the individual who was responsible\nfor the property to be included in the record; (f) insure that the claim was filed in a\ntimely manner; (g) verify that the\ninmate adequately proved ownership of the property; (h) determine the reasonable level of\ncompensation; (i) review the\ninvestigation report to insure its completeness (incomplete reports shall be\nreturned for further information); and\n(j) at the appeal stage, the lack of a\ncomplete investigation report is reasonable grounds for supporting the original\nclaim. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n1700.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
