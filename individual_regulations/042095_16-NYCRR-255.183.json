  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.183 - Vaults: structural design requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each underground vault or pit for valves, pressure relieving, pressure limiting, or pressure regulating equipment, must\nbe able to meet the loads which may be imposed upon it, and to protect\ninstalled equipment. (b) There must\nbe enough working space so that all of the equipment required in the vault or\npit can be properly installed, operated, and maintained. (c) Each pipe entering, or within, a\nregulator vault or pit must be steel for sizes 10 inches (254 millimeters) and\nless, except that control and gauge piping may be copper. Where pipe extends\nthrough the vault or pit structure, provision must be made to prevent the\npassage of gasses or liquids through the opening and to avert strains in the\npipe. (d) In the design of vaults\nand pits for pressure limiting, pressure relieving, and pressure regulating\nequipment, consideration shall be given to the protection of the installed\nequipment from damage, such as that resulting from an explosion within the\nvault or pit, which may cause portions of the roof or cover to fall into the\nvault. (e) Vault or pit openings\nshall be located so as to minimize the hazards of tools or other objects\nfalling upon the regulator, piping, or other equipment. The control piping and\nthe operating parts of the equipment installed shall not be located under a\nvault or pit opening where workmen can step on them when entering or leaving\nthe vault or pit, unless such parts are suitably protected. (f) Whenever a vault or pit opening is to be\nlocated above equipment which could be damaged by a falling cover, a circular\ncover shall be installed or other suitable precautions taken. Notes\nN.Y.
