No person shall park an aircraft or leave the same standing at any\nplace on the airport other than inside a hangar unless it is firmly tied to the\nground in the manner prescribed by the airport operator. The main landing\nwheels shall be chocked with wheel blocks or other approved devices, except in\ncases where, in the opinion of the airport operator, other proven procedures\nare equally safe. In addition to the above, helicopters shall have braking\ndevices and/or rotor mooring blocks applied to the rotor blades. (b) Transient parking. Operators may park or\nleave standing an aircraft in areas designated by the airport operator for\ntransient parking provided the aircraft is secured to the ground in the manner\ndescribed in subdivision (a) of this section.

Upon direction from the airport operator, the operator of any aircraft parked\nor stored at the airport shall move said aircraft from the place where it is\nparked or stored to any other designated place. Should the operator refuse to\ncomply with such direction, the airport operator may tow said aircraft to such\ndesignated place at the operator's expense and, if such direction was\nreasonable under the circumstances, without liability for damage which may\nresult in the course of such moving.
