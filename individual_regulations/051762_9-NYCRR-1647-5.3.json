  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1647-5.3 - Disbursements from reserve fund\n\nState Regulations\n\nSince only occasional disbursements will be made from\nthe reserve fund, it will be unnecessary to have separate reserve fund vouchers\nand checks printed. In lieu thereof, administration fund vouchers and checks\nmay be adapted for use in making reserve fund disbursement by striking out the\nwords \"Administration Fund\" and substituting therefor the words \"Reserve\n\nFund\". Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1647-5.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
