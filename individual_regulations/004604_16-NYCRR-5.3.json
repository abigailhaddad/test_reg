Each party's interrogatories (and document requests pursuant to section\n5.4\nof this Part) shall be\nnumbered consecutively throughout the proceeding. A copy of every interrogatory\nshall be served on each party, and on the presiding officer, if he or she so\nrequests.

If the name of that individual\nis not set forth on the response, it shall be provided promptly by the\nresponding party upon request. (c) Except as provided below, a party to whom an interrogatory is directed shall\nanswer each question separately in writing, and shall set forth the question\nimmediately before its answer. Answers shall be served on the requesting party\nwithin 10 days following service of the interrogatory, and a copy shall be\nserved on any presiding officer or party who so requests.
