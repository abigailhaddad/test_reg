  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 6, ch. X, Appendices, app 30\n\nState Regulations\n(cf. Part 372)\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR THE UNIFORM HAZARDOUS WASTE MANIFEST\n(EPA Forms 8700-22 and 8700-22A)\n\nGeneral Information. Read all instructions before completing this form. This form\nhas been designed for use on a 12-pitch (elite) typewriter; a firm point pen\nmay also be used-- press down hard. New York State regulation requires generators and\ntransporters of hazardous waste and owners or operators of a hazardous waste\ntreatment, storage and disposal facilities to complete a manifest (EPA form\n8700-22), and, if necessary, the continuation sheet (EPA form 8700-22A) for\nboth inter- and intrastate transportation of hazardous waste. Omissions, false\ncoding or illegibility is considered a violation. All generators are\nresponsible under New York State and Federal law for the proper identification, labeling, manifesting and ultimate disposal of all hazardous waste they\ngenerate. The manifest system is designed to track hazardous waste from the\npoint of generation until its final disposal (cradle to grave). In order to\naccomplish that goal, it is essential that all items on a manifest be properly\ncompleted. Distribution. Distribution of each copy of the manifest is indicated on the\nbottom of the form. Additional copies of the form may be required. For example, the generator must make additional copies of the manifest, as necessary, to be\nsubmitted by the generator to the generator state and the disposer state. Extra\ncopies of the manifest will be needed if more than one transporter is used. For\nexports, the transporter must deliver a copy of the manifest to the U.S. Customs when exporting the waste across U.S. borders and mail a copy to the\ngenerator. For imports, the TSD must mail a copy of the manifest to the USEPA. For rejected loads, the final receiving facility (generator or TSD), must make\nmanifest copies to submit to the generator state and the disposer state, as\nnecessary. New York State regulations provide 10 calendar days for a generator\nand 10 calendar days for a TSDF to distribute manifest copies. The disposer's\nstate is the state in which the designated TSD facility is located. The\ngenerator's state is the state in which the installation generating the\nhazardous waste is located. TSD facility is a treatment, storage or disposal\nfacility. For submittal to the department, mail manifest related\ndocuments to: New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Division\nof Solid & Hazardous Materials, Manifest Section, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY\n12233-7252. Public Reporting Burden. The following statement must be included with each Uniform\n\nHazardous Waste Manifest, either on the form, in the instructions to the form, or accompanying the form: \"Public reporting burden for this collection of information\nis estimated to average: 30 minutes for generators, 10 minutes for\ntransporters, and 25 minutes for owners or operators of treatment, storage, and\ndisposal facilities. This includes time for reviewing instructions, gathering\ndata, completing, reviewing and transmitting the form. Any correspondence\nregarding the PRA burden statement for the manifest must be sent to the\n\nDirector of the Collection Strategies Division in EPA's Office of Information\n\nCollection at the following address: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency\n(2822T), 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20460.

Manifest discrepancies are: significant\ndifferences (as defined by sections\n373-2.5\n[b][1][i][e]\nand\n373-3.5\n[b][1][i][e]\nof this Title) between the quantity or type of hazardous waste designated on\nthe manifest or shipping paper, and the quantity and type of hazardous waste a\nfacility actually receives; rejected wastes, which may be a full or partial\nshipment of hazardous waste that the facility cannot accept; or container\nresidues, which are residues that exceed the quantity limits for \"empty\"\ncontainers set forth in section\n371.1\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Title. 2. For rejected loads\nand residues (section\n373-2.5\n[b][1][iv], [v] or\n[vi], or\n373-3.5\n[b][1][iv], [v] or\n[vi]\nof this Title), check the appropriate\nbox if the shipment is a rejected load (i.e., rejected by the designated and/or\nalternate facility and is sent to an alternate facility or returned to the\ngenerator) or a regulated residue that cannot be removed from a container. Enter the reason for the rejection or the inability to remove the residue and a\ndescription of the waste. Also, reference the manifest tracking number for any\nadditional manifests being used to track the rejected waste or residue shipment\non the original manifest. Indicate the original manifest tracking number in\n\nItem 14, the Special Handling Block and Additional Information Block of the\nadditional manifests. 3. Owners or\noperators of facilities located in unauthorized states (i.e., states in which\nthe EPA administers the hazardous waste management program) who cannot resolve\nsignificant differences in quantity or type within 15 days of receiving the\nwaste must submit to their Regional Administrator a letter with a copy of the\n\nManifest at issue describing the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it\n(40 CFR\n264.72\n[c] and 265.72[c]). 4. Owners or operators of facilities located\nin authorized states (i.e., those states that have received authorization from\nthe EPA to administer the hazardous waste management program, such as New York\n\nState) should contact their state agency for information on where to report\ndiscrepancies involving \"significant differences\" to state officials. For\nfacilities located in New York State, upon discovering a discrepancy, the owner\nor operator of the facility must attempt to reconcile the discrepancy with the\nwaste generator or transporter (e.g., with telephone conversations). If the\ndiscrepancy is not revolved within 15 days after receiving the waste, the owner\nor operators must immediately submit a letter to the generator state and the\ndisposer state describing the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it, and a\ncopy of the manifest or shipping paper at issue. Item 18b. Alternate Facility (or Generator) for Receipt of\n\nFull Load Rejections. Enter the name, address, phone number, and EPA\nIdentification Number of the Alternate Facility which the rejecting TSDF has\ndesignated, after consulting with the generator, to receive a fully rejected\nwaste shipment. In the event that a fully rejected shipment is being returned\nto the generator, the rejecting TSDF may enter the generator's site information\nin this space. This field is not to be used to forward partially rejected loads\nor residue waste shipments. Item 18c. Alternate Facility (or Generator) Signature. The\nauthorized representative of the alternate facility (or the generator in the\nevent of a returned shipment) must sign and date this field of the form to\nacknowledge receipt of the fully rejected wastes or residues identified by the\ninitial TSDF. Item 19. Hazardous Waste Report Management Method Codes. Enter the most appropriate Hazardous Waste Report Management Method code for\neach waste listed in Item 9. The Hazardous Waste Report Management Method code\nis to be entered by the first treatment, storage, or disposal facility (TSDF)\nthat receives the waste and is the code that best describes the way in which\nthe waste is to be managed when received by the TSDF. Item 20. Designated Facility Owner or Operator Certification\nof Receipt (Except as Noted in Item 18a). Enter the name of the person\nreceiving the waste on behalf of the owner or operator of the facility. That\nperson must acknowledge receipt or rejection of the waste described on the\n\nManifest by signing and entering the date of receipt or rejection where\nindicated. Since the facility certification acknowledges receipt of the waste\nexcept as noted in the Discrepancy Space in Item 18a, the certification should\nbe signed for both waste receipt and waste rejection, with the rejection being\nnoted and described in the space provided in Item 18a. Fully rejected wastes\nmay be forwarded or returned using Item 18b after consultation with the\ngenerator. Enter the name of the person accepting the waste on behalf of the\nowner or operator of the alternate facility or the original generator in Item\n18b. That person must acknowledge receipt or rejection of the waste described\non the Manifest by signing and entering the date they received or rejected the\nwaste in Item 18c. Partially rejected wastes and residues must be re-shipped\nunder a new manifest, to be initiated and signed by the rejecting TSDF as\nofferor of the shipment.
