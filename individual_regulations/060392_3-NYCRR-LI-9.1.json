  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 9.1 - Back office operations\n\nState Regulations\nA foreign banking corporation licensed to do business in New\n\nYork asked whether it could conduct a municipal bond operation at a so-called\n\"back-office location\" without special branch authorization. The operation\nwould have involved underwriting and trading municipal securities as a dealer\nwith other dealers, and purchasing and selling municipal securities, as an\nagent. The Department responded that the construction given to\n\nSections\n200\nand\n396\nof the Banking\n\nLaw which govern the licensing of offices for the transaction of business by\nforeign banking corporations and savings and loan associations is similar to\nthe construction given Sections\n105\nand\n240\n(2)\nof the Banking Law which prohibit banking\norganizations from transacting all or any part of the \"usual business of\nbanking\" from any place other than a principal office or duly authorized\nbranch. In construing these sections, the Department has historically\ndistinguished the activities which may be conducted solely from a duly\nauthorized office or branch from the so-called \"back office\", loan production\noffice and representative office operations for which no special approval is\nrequired. The \"back office\" exception would not apply unless the\nactivities and functions of the back office were carefully circumscribed. The\nbank's services could not be marketed from such office, and any contact with\nthe members of the public to whom or for whom such services are normally\ndirected or performed would have to take place at either the authorized office\nor branch or, to the limited extent permitted by Supervisory Policy CB 121, a\nloan production office or representative office, and not at the \"back\noffice\". The loan production office and representative office\nexceptions would not apply unless the activities and functions conducted\nthereat were carefully circumscribed and the bank had submitted the information\nrequired by CB 121. To qualify as a loan production office, the activities\nwould have to be limited to the solicitation of loans on behalf of the bank, the solicitation of investors to purchase loans from the bank, and the search\nfor servicers of the bank's loans. Although limited contact with members of the\npublic could occur in connection with such solicitations, the activities of the\nloan production office could not be so broad as to constitute the business of\nbanking within the meaning of the New York State Banking Law. See Section\n121.2(a) of Supervisory Policy CB 121. Likewise, to qualify as a representative office, the\nactivities of the office would have to be limited to the solicitation of new\nbusiness, to research, to the servicing of home office needs, and to the acting\nas a liaison between the home office and its customers in New York State. See\n\nSection 121.b(2) of the Supervisory Policy CB 121. The information provided to the department indicated that the\nactivities of the so-called \"back office\" would entail substantially more than\nthe mere solicitation of business for the Municipal Bond Department. Through\nits proposed underwriting activities, dealer activities and agency activities\nin municipal securities, the bank would have been unequivocally engaged in the\nbusiness of banking. In this connection, the department referred to a ruling of\nthe New York Attorney General, 1914 Op. Atty. Gen. 147, in which the Attorney\n\nGeneral held that the purchase, sale, and delivery of investment securities by\na trust company constituted the transaction of the business of the company and\nthat such activity could be conducted solely at an authorized location. In light of the foregoing, the department concluded that the\nproposed Municipal Bond Department operations would not fall within the \"back\noffice,\" loan production office or representative office exceptions, and that\nsuch operations could be conducted solely at a duly authorized branch.
