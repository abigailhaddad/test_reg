In addition, some\nresidential providers who are under contract to provide beds to provide\nservices to the transferred youths have been unable to open or maintain those\nbeds as a result of the storm, all of which has impeded the ability to\nimplement the initiative as quickly as the applicable laws intended; and\nWHEREAS, the enforcement of certain State statutes relating\nto such initiative, which OCFS has no ability to waive, could impede some\naffected parties ability to address the disaster emergency or to provide\nservices to those affected by the disaster emergency; NOW, THEREFORE, I, ANDREW M.
