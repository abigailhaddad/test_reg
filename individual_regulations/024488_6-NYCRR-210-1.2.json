(e) Capture rate means the\npercentage of in-use engines subject to recall which must be corrected to bring\nthe class of engines into compliance. The number of engines subject to recall\nshall be based on the actual number of engines in use as verified by engine\nregistration records compiled and prepared by industry, or a comparable source\nas determined by the executive officer at the time a recall is\ninitiated. (f) CARB means the\n\nCalifornia State Air Resources Board as defined in California's Health and\n\nSafety Code, section 39003 (2000) (see Table 1, section 200.9 of this\n\nTitle). (g) Certification means, with respect to new personal watercraft engines, obtaining an executive order\nfor an engine family complying with the spark-ignition marine engine exhaust\nemission standards and requirements specified in title 13, California Code of\n\nRegulations, sections 2442 and 2447 (see Table 1, section 200.9 of this\n\nTitle).

(i) Emission standards means specified\nlimitations on the discharge of air contaminants into the atmosphere. (j) Enforcement test results means data or\ninformation gathered through enforcement programs conducted by the CARB. These\nprograms include, but are not limited to, field inspections, in-use compliance\ntesting, assembly-line testing. (k) Engine family means a subclass of a basic engine based on similar emission\ncharacteristics. The engine family is the grouping of engines that is used for\nthe purposes of certification. (l) Engine identification number means a unique specification (for example, model\nnumber/serial number combination) that allows each spark-ignition marine engine\nto be distinguished from other similar engines. (m) Engine manufacturer means the\nmanufacturer granted certification. (n) Executive officer means the Executive\n\nOfficer of the CARB or his or her authorized representative. (o) Executive order means an order issued by\nthe executive officer of CARB certifying engines for sale in\n\nCalifornia. (p) Exhaust emissions\nmeans matter emitted into the environment from any opening downstream from the\nexhaust port of a spark-ignition marine engine. (q) Family emission limit or FEL means an\nemission value assigned by a marine engine manufacturer to an engine family for\nthe purpose of complying with a corporate average exhaust emission standard. The FEL must not exceed the limit specified in title 13, California Code of\n\nRegulations, section 2442 (see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title). (r) Inboard engine means a four-stroke\nspark-ignition marine engine not used in a personal watercraft that is designed\nsuch that the propeller shaft penetrates the hull of the marine watercraft\nwhile the engine and the remainder of the drive unit is internal to the hull of\nthe marine watercraft. (s) Marine\nengine manufacturer means any person engaged in the manufacturing or assembling\nof new spark-ignition marine engines or the importing of such engines for\nresale, or who acts for and is under the control of any such person in\nconnection with the distribution of such engines. A spark-ignition marine\nengine manufacturer does not include any dealer with respect to new\nspark-ignition marine engines received by such person in commerce. (t) Marine watercraft means every description\nof boat, ship or other artificial contrivance used, or capable of being\noperated on water. (u) Military\ntactical vehicles or equipment means vehicles or equipment owned by the U.S. Department of Defense and/or the U.S. military services and used in combat, combat support, combat service support, tactical or relief operations, or\ntraining for such operations. (v) Model year means the engine manufacturer's annual new model production period\nwhich includes January 1st of the calendar year for which the model year is\nnamed, ends no later than December 31st of the calendar year, and does not\nbegin earlier than January 2nd of the previous calendar year. Where an engine\nmanufacturer has no annual new model production period, model year means the\ncalendar year. (w) Modified part\nmeans any aftermarket part intended to replace an original equipment\nemissions-related part and which is not functionally identical to the original\nequipment part in all respects which in any way affect emissions, excluding a\nconsolidated part. (x) New means a\npersonal watercraft engine or personal watercraft the equitable or legal title\nto which has never been transferred to an ultimate purchaser. Where the\nequitable or legal title to the engine or personal watercraft is not\ntransferred to an ultimate purchaser until after the engine or watercraft is\nplaced into service, then the engine or watercraft will no longer be new after\nit is placed into service. A personal watercraft engine or watercraft is placed\ninto service when it is used for its functional purposes. With respect to\nimported personal watercraft engines or watercraft, the term new means an\nengine or watercraft that is not covered by an executive order issued at the\ntime of importation, and that is manufactured after the effective date of this\nregulation or Part which is applicable to such engine or watercraft, or which\nwould be applicable to such engine or watercraft had it been manufactured for\nimportation into the United States. (y) Nonconformity or noncompliance means that\na significant number, determined by the executive officer, of a class of\nengines, although properly maintained and used, experience a failure of the\nsame emission-related component(s) within their useful lives which, if\nuncorrected, results in the engines' failure to comply with the emission\nstandards prescribed under title 13, California Code of Regulations, section\n2442 (see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title) which are applicable to the\nmodel year of such engines; or a class of engines that at any time within their\nuseful lives, although properly maintained and used, on average does not comply\nwith the emission standards prescribed under title 13, California Code of\n\nRegulations, section 2442 (see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title) which are\napplicable to the model year of such engines.

(aa)\n\nPersonal\nwatercraft engine means a spark-ignition marine engine that does not meet the\ndefinition of outboard engine, inboard engine or sterndrive engine, except that\nthe executive officer may, in his or her discretion, classify a personal\nwatercraft engine as an inboard or sterndrive engine if it is comparable in\ntechnology and emissions to an inboard or sterndrive engine. (ab)\n\nProduction-line tests are emission tests\nperformed on a sample of production engines produced for sale in California and\nconducted in accordance with title 13, California Code of Regulations, section\n2446(a) (see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title). (ac)\n\nReplacement part means any aftermarket\npart which is intended to replace an original equipment emissions-related part\nand which is functionally identical to the original equipment part in all\nrespects which in any way affect emissions (including durability), or a\nconsolidated part.

(ag) Spark-ignition marine engine means any engine used\nto propel a marine watercraft, and which utilizes the spark-ignition combustion\ncycle; including, but not limited to personal watercraft, outboard, inboard and\nstendrive engines. (ah)\n\nSterndrive engine means a four-stroke spark-ignition marine engine not used in\na personal watercraft that is designed such that the drive unit is external to\nthe hull of the marine watercraft, while the engine is internal to the hull of\nthe marine watercraft. (ai)\n\nTest\nengine means the engine or group of engines that an engine manufacturer uses\nduring certification, production line and in-use testing to determine\ncompliance with emission standards. (aj)\n\nTest group means a grouping of vehicles\nas defined by 40 CFR section\n86.1827-01\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of\nthis Title). (ak)\n\nUltimate purchaser\nmeans, with respect to any new spark-ignition marine engine, the first person\nwho in good faith purchases such new spark-ignition marine engine for purposes\nother than resale. (al)\nU.S.C. means\n\nUnited States Code. (am)\n\nUseful life\nmeans nine years for personal watercraft engines. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
