  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 52.9 - Dental hygiene\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For\nlicensure qualifying programs, admission requirements shall include successful\ncompletion of an approved four-year course of study in an approved secondary\nschool. (b) Requirements for\nprograms leading to the dental hygiene restricted local infiltration\nanesthesia/nitrous oxide analgesia certificate. (1)\n\nDefinitions. As used in this subdivision: (i) Analgesia means the diminution of\npain. (ii)\n\nAnxiolysis means the\ndiminution or elimination of anxiety. (iii)\n\nConscious sedation means a minimally\ndepressed level of consciousness that retains the patient's ability to\nindependently and continuously maintain an airway and respond appropriate to\nphysical stimulation and verbal command and that is produced by a pharmacologic\nor nonpharmacologic method or a combination thereof. Patients whose only\nresponse is reflex withdrawal from repeated painful stimuli shall not be\nconsidered to be in a state of conscious sedation. (iv)\n\nDeep sedation means an induced state of\ndepressed consciousness accompanied by partial loss of protective reflexes, including the inability to continually maintain and airway independently and/or\nto response purposefully to physical stimulation or verbal command, and is\nproduced by a pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic method or a combination\nthereof. (v) General anesthesia\nmeans an induced state of unconsciousness, accompanied by partial or complete\nloss of protective reflexes, including the inability to maintain an airway\nindependently and response purposefully to physical stimulation or verbal\ncommand, and is produced by a pharmacologic or nonpharmacologic method or a\ncombination thereof. (vi)\n\nInfiltration anesthesia means local anesthetic solution deposited near the\nterminal nerve endings in the area of prospective dental hygiene\ntreatment. (vii)\n\nLocal anesthesia\nmeans the elimination of sensation, especially pain, in one part of the body by\ntopical application or regional injection of a drug. (viii)\n\nLocal infiltration anesthesia means\nthe administration of a local anesthetic solution, meant for the elimination of\nsensation, especially pain, in one part of the body by the regional injection\nof a drug, near the terminal nerve endings in the area of prospective dental\nhygiene treatment. (ix)\n\nNitrous\noxide analgesia means the administration of a combination of nitrous oxide and\noxygen producing a diminution of pain and anxiety (anxiolysis). (x) Scavenging system means the basic\nengineering control for waste nitrous oxide gas. Such systems collect waste gas\nand ventilate it from the operating room. (xi)\n\nUnder person supervision of a licensed\ndentist means that the supervising licensed dentist remains in the dental\noffice or other location where the local infiltration anesthesia or nitrous\noxide analgesia services are being performed by the licensed dental hygienist\nor other student in clinical practice in a program registered pursuant to this\nsubdivision, personally authorizes and prescribes the use of local infiltration\nanesthesia or nitrous oxide analgesia for the patient and, before dismissal of\nthe patient, personally examines the condition of the patient after the use of\nlocal infiltration anesthesia or nitrous oxide analgesia that is administered\nby the licensed dental hygienist or other student in clinical practice in a\nprogram registered pursuant to this subdivision is completed. (2)\n\nIn addition to meeting all\napplicable provisions of this Part, to be registered as a program leading to\nthe dental hygiene restricted local infiltration anesthesia/nitrous oxide\nanalgesia certificate, the program shall be offered by an institution which has\nprograms that are registered by the department pursuant to this Part as leading\nto licensure in dentistry and/or dental hygiene and include the didactic\ncomponent and clinical and laboratory experience component, as prescribed in\nthis paragraph. A student admitted to the program must be a dental hygienist\nlicensed in New York State or a student in a program registered as leading to\nlicensure in dental hygiene pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section. (i) Didactic component. The program shall\ninclude at least 30 clock hours of didactic instruction relating to the\nadministration and monitoring of local infiltration anesthesia and nitrous\noxide analgesia in the practice of dental hygiene. Such coursework shall\ninclude, but not be limited to, the following content areas: (a) relevant New York State Education Law and\ncommissioner's regulations; (b) medical history and evaluation procedures; (c) review of pediatric and adult respiratory\nand circulatory physiology and related anatomy; (d) stages of drug-induced central nervous\nsystem depression through levels of anxiolysis, conscious sedation, deep\nsedation and general anesthesia; (e) definitions and descriptions of\nphysiological and psychological aspects of anxiety and pain; (f) pharmacology of agents used in inhalation\nsedation, local anesthesia and vasoconstrictors, including drug interactions\nand incompatibilities; (g) indications and contraindications for use of inhalation sedation and local\nanesthesia; (h) recommended dosages\nof local anesthesia and nitrous oxide analgesia; (i) patient monitoring using observation, with particular attention to vital signs and reflexes related to\nconsciousness; (j) selection and\npreparation of the armamentaria and recordkeeping for administering various\nlocal anesthetic agents and nitrous oxide analgesia; (k) recognition and management of\ncomplications and management of reactions to local anesthetic agents and\nnitrous oxide analgesia; (l) proper\ninfection control techniques with regard to local anesthetic and nitrous oxide\nanalgesia and proper disposal of sharps; (m) description and use of inhalation\nsedation equipment; (n) introduction to potential health hazards of trace anesthetics and proposed\ntechniques for limiting occupational exposure such as appropriate scavenging\nsystems; (o) abuse potential and\nhallucinatory effects of nitrous oxide analgesia; (p) post-operative care of the patient and\ninstruction to the patient; and\n(q) a course in basic life support (BLS), or its equivalent as determined by the\ndepartment. (ii)\n\nClinical and laboratory experience component. The program shall include at\nleast 15 clock hours of clinical and laboratory experience relating to the\nadministration and monitoring of local infiltration anesthesia and nitrous\noxide analgesia in the practice of dental hygiene. When a licensed dental\nhygienist or other student administers or monitors nitrous oxide analgesia or\nlocal infiltration anesthesia in such clinical or laboratory practice, the\nlicensed dental hygienist or other student shall be under the personal\nsupervision of a licensed dentist, as defined in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. Such experience shall include, but not be limited to, the\nfollowing: (a) selection and preparation of\nthe armamentaria for administering various local anesthetic agents and nitrous\noxide analgesia including demonstrations regarding scavenging\nsystems; (b) demonstration of\nproper infection control techniques with regard to local anesthetics agents and\nnitrous oxide analgesia and proper disposal of sharps; (c) demonstration of proper evaluation of the\npatient's health status, taking the patient's vital signs and monitoring the\npatient's physical status while under the effects of local anesthesia and/or\nnitrous oxide analgesia; (d) administration of local anesthetic in conjunction with inhalation sedation\ntechniques; (e) a clinical\nexperience demonstrating the successful use of local infiltration anesthesia in\nno fewer than 15 instances involving the treatment of a patient, provided that\nno individual patient may be treated more than three times; and a clinical\nexperience, demonstrating the successful use of nitrous oxide analgesia in no\nfewer than 15 instances involving the treatment of a patient, of which at least\nfive instances would be induced by the candidate and the remaining instances\nwould be observed by the candidate, provided that in no such instance may an\nindividual patient be treated more than two times. The clinical experience\nprescribed in this clause shall be under the personal supervision of a licensed\ndentist, as defined in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
