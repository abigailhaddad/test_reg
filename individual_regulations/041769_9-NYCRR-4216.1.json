Tit. 9 § 4216.1 - Pools - calculation and distribution\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe pari-mutuel pools shall be calculated and distributed\nas follows: (a) Win, place, show, daily double or twin double wagers form separate wagering pools with payoffs\ncalculated independently of each other. (b) From each pool there shall be deducted\nthis percentage provided by statute, the remainder being the net pool for\ndistribution, less the breaks, as provided by the Pari-Mutuel Revenue\n\nLaw. (c) Win pool. (1)\n\nThe net pool divided by the amount\nwagered on the horse finishing first determines the payoff per dollar, including profit and wager. (2)\n\nWhen two horses finish first in a dead heat, the money in the win pool is\ndivided the same as in a place pool calculation. (d) Place pool. (1)\n\nThe amounts wagered on horses finishing\nfirst and second are deducted from the net pool to determine the profit. This\nprofit is divided in half, and the halves, in turn, divided by the two amounts\nmentioned above. This determines the profit per dollar, to which is added the\nwager. (2)\n\nWhen two horses finish\nsecond in a dead heat, one half of the profit is allocated to the tickets\nrepresenting wagers on the horse finishing first, and the remaining half is\nallocated equally to the wagers on horses finishing first, and the remaining\nhalf is allocated equally to the wagers on horses finishing in the dead heat\nfor second. (3)\n\nWhen two horses in\nthe field or coupled as an entry run first and second, the place pool shall be\ndistributed the same as in a win pool. (e) Show pool. (1)\n\nThe amounts wagered on the horses\nfinishing first, second and third are deducted from the net pool to determine\nthe profit. This profit is divided into three equal parts, and each part, in\nturn, divided by the three amounts mentioned in subdivision (d) of this\nsection. This determines the profit per dollar, to which is added the\nwager. (2)\n\nWhen two horses finish\nthird in a dead heat, one third of the profit is allocated to the tickets\nrepresenting wagers on the horse finishing first, one third to the wagers\nfinishing second and the remaining third equally to wagers on the horses\nfinishing in the dead heat for third. (3)\n\nWhen two horses in the field or coupled\nas an entry finish first and second, first and third or second and third, two\nthirds of the profit is allocated to the tickets representing wagers on the\nfield or entry, and the remaining one third to the wagers on the other\nhorse. (4)\n\nWhen one horse in the\nfield or coupled as an entry finished first or second, and the other part of\nthe entry or field finished third in a dead heat with another horse, one half\nof the profit is allocated to the tickets representing wagers on the field or\nentry, one-third to the horse finishing first or second, and the remaining\none-sixth to the wagers on the horse finishing third in the dead heat with the\nfield or entry. (5)\n\nWhen three\nhorses in the field or coupled as an entry run first, second and third, the\nplace and show pools shall be distributed the same as a win pool. (f) When only two horses finish, the show pool, if any, shall be distributed the same as in a place\npool. (g) When only one horse\nfinishes, the place and show pools, if any, shall be distributed the same as in\na win pool. (h) In any race in\nwhich no horse finishes, all money wagered on the race shall be refunded upon\npresentation and surrender of pari-mutuel tickets sold thereon. (i) Payment where no wagering on a horse in\nthe win, place or show pools. (1)\n\nIn the\nevent that there is no money wagered to win on a horse which has finished\nfirst, the pool will be refunded. (2)\n\nIn the event that there is no money\nwagered to place on a horse which finished first or second, the net pool will\nbe distributed to wagers on the horse upon which money was wagered to place and\nwhich did so finish; if none, the pool will be refunded. (3)\n\nIn the event that there is no money\nwagered to show on a horse which has finished first, second or third, the net\npool will be distributed to wagers on the horses upon which money was wagered\nto show and which did so finish, as in a place pool; if only one, to wagers\nupon such horse as in a win pool; if none, the pool will be refunded. Should\nthese circumstances be foreseeable when a pool closes, an immediate\nannouncement shall be made to hold all tickets because all betting combinations\nare not covered. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
