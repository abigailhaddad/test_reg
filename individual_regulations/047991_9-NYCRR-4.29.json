[DOUBLE DAGGER]\nState Regulations\n\nIt is important that the State of New York, and its\nagencies and departments, apply consistent standards in determining when\npreference should be given to domestic steel in implementing the requirements\nof section\n146\nof the\n\nState Finance Law. Accordingly, it is necessary to develop a minimum standard\nfor reference by agency and department heads in their exercise of discretion\npursuant to this legislation. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws\nof the State of New York, hereby promulgate the following guidelines. I. In implementing the provisions of section\n146\nof the\n\nState Finance Law, agency and department heads should consider, after\ndetermining that grounds exist pursuant to that section for granting a waiver\nof the domestic steel preference based upon unreasonable cost, whether: (1)\nA bid or proposal offers foreign steel, the cost of which plus six percent thereof, is less than the cost of comparable\ndomestic construction steel; and\n(2)\n\nThat bid or proposal offers the lowest\nprice of any received after adding to each bid or proposal, for evaluation\npurposes, six percent of the cost of all foreign steel, offered in each bid or\nproposal. II. Each agency\nand department head, upon making a determination that the use of American steel\nwould unreasonably increase the cost of a contract, shall submit to the\n\nDirector of State Operations, within seven days of making such determination\nand prior to letting of the contract, the facts upon which the determination\nwas based. III. It is recommended\nthat the State's public authorities that are subject to the domestic steel\npreference of section\n2603-a\nof the Public Authorities Law\nadopt similar standards.
