Tit. 14 § 681.13 - Informed consent for service plans which involve untoward risk to an individual's protection or rights when the individual is a resident of an ICF/DD\nState Regulations\n\nNote: Between April 1, 2013 and May 31, 2014, the requirements of\nthis section are not effective with regard to behavior support plans which have\nbeen developed in accordance with section\n633.16\nof this Part and with\nregard to informed consent that has been obtained in accordance with section\n633.16\nof this Part. On April 1, 2013, requirements concerning the specially constituted committee are no longer\neffective. The requirements of this section are no longer in effect on or after\n\nMay 31, 2014. (Please note that this section is presented in a principles\nof compliance [see glossary, section\n681.99\nof this Part] and standards\nof certification [see glossary, section\n681.99\nof this Part]\nformat.)\n(a) Principles of\ncompliance. (1)\n\nPrinciples of\ncompliance represent those requirements with which an agency/facility must\ncomply, but against which the agency/facility will not be routinely surveyed\nfor recertification purposes. However, evidence of failure to comply with the\nprinciples may be the basis for decertification in accordance with article 16\nof the Mental Hygiene Law. (2)\n\nNo\nservice plan (see glossary, section\n681.99\nof this Part) which\ninvolves an untoward risk to an individual's protection or rights, including\nthose designed to manage inappropriate behavior and inclusive of those\nemploying medication for such purposes, shall be implemented until informed\nconsent is obtained in conformance with this section. (3)\n\nNothing in this section shall be deemed\nto limit the availability of medical, dental, health, and hospital services, which may be rendered to an individual of any age without seeking informed\nconsent when, in the physician's judgment, an emergency exists creating an\nimmediate need for attention. (4)\n\nNothing in this section shall be deemed to limit the necessity for informed\nconsent for professional medical treatment as required by section\n633.11\nof this Title. (5)\n\nDetermining whether a service plan\nconstitutes an untoward risk to an individual's protection or rights (see\nglossary, section\n681.99\nof this Part), and\ncommittee approval of such plans: (i) An\nindividual's interdisciplinary team shall review each service plan developed to\ndetermine whether the proposed plan constitutes an untoward risk to the\nindividual's protection and rights. (ii)\n\nIf an interdisciplinary team considers\nthat a proposed service plan constitutes an untoward risk to an individual's\nprotection or rights, the plan shall be referred to the specially constituted\ncommittee charged with the responsibility for reviewing programs that may\ninvolve untoward risks to an individual's protection or rights pursuant to the\nprovisions of\n42 CFR\n483.440(f)(3). (iii)\n\nThe specially constituted committee, upon receipt of a service plan referred to it from an interdisciplinary team, shall determine whether or not the service plan constitutes an untoward risk to\nan individual's protection or rights. (iv)\n\nIf the specially constituted committee\ndetermines that a service plan constitutes an untoward risk to an individual's\nprotection or rights, it shall approve or disapprove the implementation of the\nplan and, if approved, ensure that the requirements of this Part are\nmet. (6)\n\nRole of the\nfacility when obtaining informed consent for a proposed service plan that\nconstitutes an untoward risk to an individual's protection or rights: (i) The administrator shall ensure the\nobtaining of written informed consent by or on behalf of an individual whose\nservice plan is under consideration. As it is the intent of this section to\nensure an individual's participation in granting or withholding informed\nconsent for any service plan affecting him or her, it is, therefore, necessary\nto ensure that the presentation to the individual be in terms and a manner that\nwill most easily facilitate understanding by that individual. (a) In every case it shall be the duty of the\nadministrator to ensure that the individual is personally afforded an\nappropriate explanation of the proposed service plan. (b) If an individual with the ability to give\nconsent (see glossary, section\n681.99\nof this Part), gives his or\nher informed consent, and does not object, one of the following parties, in the\norder of priority stated, shall be informed of the proposed service plan before\nimplementation: (1)\nan individual's actively\ninvolved (see glossary, section\n681.99\nof this Part) adult\nspouse; (2)\nan individual's\nactively involved parent; (3)\nan\nindividual's actively involved adult child; (4)\nan individual's actively involved adult\nfamily member (see glossary, section\n681.99\nof this Part); and\n(5)\nthe consumer advisory board\nfor the Willowbrook class (for a class member only). (c) The party receiving notice as listed\nabove shall be informed of the right to appeal service plan decisions pursuant\nto section\n633.12\nof this Title.

It may also present, for\nconsideration on a contingent basis, a range of related treatment approaches. However, all such interventions and/or related treatment approaches shall have\nbeen described to the individual in terms and manner that would be most easily\nunderstood. (ii)\n\nIn those instances\nwhen an individual's interdisciplinary team considers, beyond any reasonable\ndoubt, that the individual does not have the ability to give informed consent: (a) The team, through its member having\ncoordination responsibility, shall enter a written opinion and detailed\nanalysis as to why it considers the individual to be unable to provide informed\nconsent. (b) The opinion and\nanalysis of the team shall be reviewed by a New York State licensed\npsychologist, or a New York State licensed physician who is board certified or\neligible to be certified as a psychiatrist, who is not a member of the\nindividual's interdisciplinary team, and who may or may not be an employee of\nthe agency/facility. Such professional shall review the material provided and, in writing, provide an opinion as to whether the individual has the ability to\ngive informed consent. If the professional disagrees with the team, the\nrequirements of subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph shall be\nfollowed. (iii)\n\nIf it is\nnot clear to the interdisciplinary team that an individual does not have the\nability to give informed consent, it shall be the responsibility of the\nadministrator to comply with the requirements listed below. The administrator\nshall: (a) obtain from the individual's\ninterdisciplinary team, its written opinion and analysis of the individual's\nability to understand the proposed service plan, and of the individual's\nability to give or withhold informed consent thereto; (b) obtain from a New York State licensed\npsychologist, or New York State licensed physician who is board certified or\neligible for certification as a psychiatrist, a written opinion and analysis of\nthe individual's ability to understand the proposed service plan, and of the\nindividual's ability to give inform consent thereto. Said professional shall\nnot have any ownership, employment relationship, or other interest in the\nagency/facility which would compromise his or her objectivity in\ndecisionmaking; (c) after\nconsidering the opinion of the interdisciplinary team and the psychologist or\npsychiatrist, determine whether it is appropriate to obtain consent from a\nparty duly recognized by this section, and whether to proceed in accordance\nwith the other provisions of this section; and\n(d) ensure that the opinions of the\ninterdisciplinary team and the psychologist or psychiatrist, and the decision\nof the administrator, are documented in the individual's record and\ncommunicated to that individual and to his or her actively involved adult\nspouse, parent, adult child, or adult family member; unless the individual is\nan adult who has been determined to have the ability to give informed consent, objects to such notice being made. (iv)\n\nThe administrator shall ensure that\nthese procedures for determining ability to give informed consent are also\nfollowed whenever: (a) there is a significant\ndeparture from the material considered in relation to determining an\nindividual's ability to understand the proposed treatment\n(\ni.e., the service plan or originally proposed alternative\ntreatment approaches); (b) when a\ntotally new service plan with a different approach is proposed; (c) when there has been a change in the\ndiagnosis of the individual; or\n(d) when there has been a change in the determination of an individual's ability to\ngive informed consent by the individual's interdisciplinary team or a\npsychologist. Note: Once ability to give informed consent has been determined, it\nis not necessary to reevaluate such ability unless one of the above four\nconditions occur. (9)\n\nObjections to the medication component of\na plan designed to manage inappropriate behavior may be made. (i) Such objections may be made: (a) by an individual 18 years of age or older\nwho does not have a guardian lawfully empowered to give medical consent; or by\nan individual under the age of 18 where consent has not been derived from a\nlawfully empowered guardian or parent; (b) irrespective of a judgement about the\nindividual's ability to understand appropriate disclosures regarding a proposed\nservice plan; and\n(c) by conveying\nthe objection in whatever manner is typically utilized by an individual to\ncommunicate a meaningful decision (which does not include stereotypic actions, reactions, or responses). (ii)\n\nIf all reasonable attempts to resolve\nthe issue have not resulted in agreement to proceed with the use of medication, then the medication component of a service plan shall not be administered\nwithout an order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Notification of the\nindividual's objection to medication shall be given to the party or committee\nhaving initially given consent. (10)\n\nConsent committee. (i) This committee need not be a \"standing\"\ncommittee. It may be a committee convened on an as-needed basis with\nappropriate representation for the purpose of reviewing a request(s) for\ninformed consent. (ii)\n\nInformed\nconsent may be obtained from a committee convened for that purpose, for service\nplans, including ones designed to manage inappropriate behavior, and inclusive\nof those employing medication for such purpose, where such service plans\nconstitute an untoward risk to the individual's protection or rights, if a duly\nappointed guardian or other parties authorized by this section to give informed\nconsent are unavailable to do so. (iii)\n\nEach B/DDSO shall arrange for the\ncreation of a committee. Services of a committee may be made available to\ncommunity-based facilities, whether State or voluntary agency\noperated. (iv)\n\nVoluntary\nagencies/facilities may arrange for the creation of their own committee(s) or, if available, use the one provided by the B/DDSO. (v) When a consent committee meeting is\nconvened, it shall: (a) consist of at least\nthree individuals or parties, with a majority having no ownership, employment\nrelationship or other interest in the agency/facility which would compromise\nhis or her objectivity in decisionmaking. (b) have at least one QIDP; and\n(c) not include anyone who is involved in the\ncare and treatment of an individual whose service plan is under\nreview. (vi)\n\nMembership\nshall be drawn from the following groups: (a) staff members; (b) staff members of\nanother agency/facility; (c) individuals receiving services from OPWDD-operated or certified\nfacilities; (d) parents, court\nappointed guardians, or family members of those with developmental disabilities\nwho have demonstrated sensitivity to issues surrounding the treatment of those\nwith such disabilities; (e) advocates of those with developmental disabilities who have demonstrated\nsensitivity to issues surrounding the treatment of those with developmental\ndisabilities; and\n(f) parties who\nhave either experience or training in contemporary practices to change\ninappropriate behavior. (vii)\n\nThe Mental Hygiene Legal Services may\nrepresent the interests of individuals before the committee where the\nindividual is a resident of a developmental center or is on conditional release\ntherefrom, and shall be notified of any committee meetings where the service\nplans of such individuals will be under consideration. (viii)\n\nThe committee shall reach its decision\nwithin 14 days of receiving an application for consent. (ix)\n\nThe committee's decision shall be by\nmajority vote. (11)\n\nAll\ninformation required to be conveyed by the requirements of this section shall\nbe communicated in whatever language or method is appropriate to ensure\nunderstanding by the individual and/or the individual's parent, guardian, spouse, adult child, or other adult family member. That is, the agency/facility\npersonnel responsible for obtaining informed consent shall use the language, whether spoken or written, that the individual/party is most comfortable using\nand most clearly understands. Examples of acceptable forms of communication\ninclude, but are not limited to, sign language, a communications board, a\ncomputer-assisted technology, Braille, etc. There shall be agency/facility\npolicies/procedures to implement this process as well as the process whereby\nindividuals can be made aware of and understand, to the extent possible, the\nrights to which they are entitled pursuant to this section. (b) Standards of certification. (1)\n\nStandards of certification represent\nthose criteria which specify the basis of documenting compliance with the\nrequirements for the operation of an ICF/ DD. The basis of documentation may\ninclude facility specific records; specified forms or reports; specified\ncontents of records; report or forms; and/or other means of assessing\ncompliance such as interviews with individuals residing in the facility, employees or volunteers, and/ or on-site observation of activities and the\nenvironment. (2)\n\nWhen it has been\ndetermined, by a specially constituted committee charged with the\nresponsibility, that a service plan involves untoward risk to an individual's\nprotection or rights, OPWDD shall verify (see glossary, section\n681.99\nof this Part) that written\ninformed consent has been obtained from: (i) the individual, if the individual has the ability to give informed consent and\nis either 18 years of age or older or is under the age of 18 and is married; or\n(ii)\nif the individual is 18\nyears of age or older but does not have the ability to give informed consent, OPWDD shall verify that such consent has been obtained from a court appointed\nguardian; an actively involved spouse, adult child, parent, or adult family\nmember; the consumer advisory board for the Willowbrook class (for class\nmembers only); a consent committee; or a court of competent jurisdiction; or\n(iii)\nif the individual is under\nthe age of 18 and unmarried or married and unable to give informed consent, OPWDD shall verify that such consent has been obtained from a court appointed\nguardian; an actively involved spouse, parent, or adult family member; the\nconsumer advisory board for the Willowbrook class (for class members only); a\nconsent committee; or a court of competent jurisdiction. (3)\nOPWDD shall further verify that the\nsigned consent document is in the written language that the individual or party\ngiving consent is most comfortable using and most clearly understands, or\nthrough the written verification of a witness that the individual understood\nand agreed to the document before signing or putting his or her mark\nthereon.
