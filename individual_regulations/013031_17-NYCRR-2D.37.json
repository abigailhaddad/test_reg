  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2D.37 - Destination Signs (D1 Series)\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE Paragraph 04. INSERT the following paragraphs: Option: 02A In some cases, an action message such as \"KEEP LEFT\" or\nKEEP RIGHT\" may communicate direction to motorists more clearly than an arrow. In such cases, an action message may be used instead of an arrow. When an\naction message is used, one additional destination may appear on the\nsign. Guidance: 02B An action message should be placed below the associated\ndestination legend. Standard: 02C When an action message is used on a destination sign, and an additional destination appears, a horizontal separator line the same\nwidth as the border shall separate the legends for the two destinations. 02D Where used, the action message legend shall be 4 inches\nhigh where the destination legend is 6 inches high. The action message legend\nshall be 6 inches high where the destination legend is 8 inches high. The\naction message legend shall be 8 inches high where the destination legend is 12\ninches high. Guidance: 03A The use of horizontal separator lines should be limited\nto instances where it is deemed necessary to emphasize the presence of\nindependent messages appearing on the same sign face. On most Destination\nsigns, adequate separation of destinations should be accomplished through the\nspacing of lines of legend. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2D.37\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
