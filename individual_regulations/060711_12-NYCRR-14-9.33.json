  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.33 - Feedwater valves\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The feedwater piping for all boilers, except for high temperature water boilers\ncomplying with the requirements of subdivision (h) of this section, and for\nforced flow steam generators with no fixed steam and water line complying with\nthe requirements of subdivision (i) of this section, shall be provided with a\ncheck valve and a stop valve or cock between the check valve and the boiler. The stop valve or cock shall comply with the requirements of ASME. (b) The relative locations of the check and\nstop (or cock) valves, as required in subdivision (a) of this section, may be\nreversed on a single boiler-turbine unit installation. (c) If a boiler is equipped with a duplicate\nfeed arrangement, each such arrangement shall be equipped as required by these\nrules. (d) When the supply line to\na boiler is divided into branch feed connections and all such connections are\nequipped with stop and check valves, the stop and check valves in the common\nsource may be omitted. (e) When two\nor more boilers are fed from a common source, there shall also be a globe or\nregulating valve in the branch to each boiler located between the check valve\nand the source of supply. A typical arrangement is shown in Figure P-44(a). Wherever globe style valves are used on feed piping, the inlet shall be under\nthe disk of the valve. (f) A\ncombination stop and check valve in which there is only one seat and disk, and\nin which a valve stem is provided to close the valve, shall be considered only\nas a stop valve, and a check valve shall be installed as otherwise\nprovided. (g) Where an economizer\nor other feedwater heating device is connected directly to the boiler without\nintervening valves, the feed valves and check valves required shall be placed\non the inlet of the economizer or feedwater heating device. (h) The recirculating return line for a high\ntemperature water boiler shall be provided with the same stop valve, or valves, required by subdivisions (a) and (c) of this section. The use of a check valve\nin the recirculating return line is optional. A check valve shall not be a\nsubstitute for a stop valve. (i) The feedwater boiler external piping for a forced flow steam generator with no\nfixed steam and water line may terminate up to and including the stop valve(s)\nand omitting the check valve(s) provided that a check valve having a pressure\nrating no less than the boiler inlet design pressure is installed at the\ndischarge of each boiler feed pump or elsewhere in the feedline between the\nfeed pump and the stop valve(s).
