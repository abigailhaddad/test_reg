  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-7.1 - Air sampling requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Personal air sampling. Air sampling shall be performed in the worker's\nbreathing zone, by the asbestos contractor for his personnel, as required by\ncurrent OSHA regulations. (b) Daily\nair sampling. Project air sampling shall be conducted daily for the full\nworkshift, for all large size projects with OSHA Class I or OSHA Class II\nfriable ACM subject to handling/abatement. (See Table 2 within section\n56-4.9\nof this Part.) If more than\none daily workshift is required to accomplish the work, air sampling shall be\nperformed on each workshift. Air sampling is not required on days when there\nare no Phase II A activities. (c) Number and location of samples - large asbestos projects. A minimum of five\nsamples shall be taken on a daily basis. The location of samples to be taken\nare as follows: (1)\nA minimum of two samples\nshall be taken outside the regulated abatement work area, within 10 feet of the\nisolation or critical barriers. When positive pressurized HVAC ducts are\nlocated within the regulated abatement work area, one of these samples shall be\ncollected within 10 feet of an HVAC diffuser, at the downstream side of the\npositive pressurized HVAC ducts, in adjoining non-work areas. Where the entire\nbuilding/structure is the regulated abatement work area, an additional exterior\nambient air sample, remote from that in paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall\nbe taken. (2)\nA minimum of one\nsample shall be taken outside the regulated abatement work area, within 10 feet\nof and within proximity to each entrance or exit from the regulated abatement\nwork area. (3)\n\nOne ambient air\nsample shall be taken outside the building or structure within 25 feet of the\nbuilding or structure. (4)\n\nOnce the\nnegative air systems have been established, one sample shall be taken in front\nof and within 10 feet of each unobstructed, negative pressure ventilation\nequipment exhaust or bank (grouping of not more than five exhaust ports at one\ntermination area) of exhausts but not within a duct itself. (5)\n\nOnce the negative air systems have been\nestablished, where negative ventilation unit exhaust ducts run through the\nnon-work area portions of building or structure to access the exterior, one\nsample shall be collected in the building or structure, within 10 feet of the\nduct system. (6)\n\nIf remote\ndecontamination units are used, one sample shall be collected at each\nentrance/exit from each personal decontamination and waste decontamination\nenclosure. (d) Work\nstoppage criteria during Phase II A abatement procedures. If air samples\ncollected outside the regulated abatement work area, indicate airborne fiber\nconcentrations at or above 0.01 fiber per cubic centimeter, or the established\nbackground level, whichever is greater, work shall stop immediately for\ninspection and repair of barriers and negative air ventilation systems as\nnecessary. Clean up of surfaces outside of the regulated abatement work area\nusing HEPA-vacuums and wet-cleaning methods shall be performed prior to\nresumption of work area preparation activities. A summary of clean up\nactivities and the results of barrier inspections including any necessary\nrepairs, shall be documented in the supervisor's daily project log. Work\nmethods shall be altered accordingly to reduce fiber concentrations to\nacceptable levels. No ACM, PACM or asbestos material shall be disturbed during\n\nPhase II A activities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-7.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
