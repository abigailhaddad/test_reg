  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 651.2 - Computation of credit\n\nState Regulations\n\nReal Property Law, § 339ee\n\nThe amount of credit as described in section\n651.1\nof this\n\nPart, is determined by multiplying the basic tax and, where applicable, the\nadditional tax, the City of New York tax, the City of Yonkers tax and the\n\nBroome County tax paid upon the recording of such a construction or blanket\nmortgage, by the purchaser's pro rata percentage of interest in the common\nelements of the condominium. Example 1: A $1 million construction mortgage on real property located\nin New York City is recorded on January 1, 1991. The proceeds of the mortgage\nare applied to the construction of a building, which consists of 10 residential\ncondominium units. Each unit is allocated 10% of the common elements as\nprovided by the condominium declaration. Upon the recording of the construction\nmortgage $5000 of basic tax, $2500 of additional tax, and $17,500 of City of\n\nNew York tax was paid. the first unit in the newly constructed building is sold on\n\nAugust 1, 1991. The purchaser, Mr. Jones, borrows $400,000 from Bank X to\nfinance his purchase, and gives a mortgage to Bank X as security for the amount\nborrowed. When the $400,000 mortgage is recorded, the taxes due and credit are\ncomputed as follows: Basic tax on $400,000 mortgage\n$2,000\n\nLess: Credit allowed against basic tax (10 percent ×\n$5000)\n500\n\nBasic tax due\n1,500\n\nAdditional tax on $400,000 mortgage\n$1,000\n\nLess:* Exclusion for first $10,000 of mortgage\ndebt\n25\n\nBalance\n975\n\nLess: Credit allowed against additional tax (10\npercent × 2500)\n250\n\nAdditional tax due\n725\n\nSpecial additional tax on $400,000 mortgage (no\ncredit allowed)\n1,000**\nCity of New York tax on $400,000 mortgage ($1 per\n$100 rate)\n4,000\n\nLess: Credit allowed against City of New York tax (10\npercent × 17,500)\n1,750\n\nCity of New York tax due\n2,250\n\nTotal mortgage recording taxes due\n$5,475\n* Since the real property covered by the mortgage is a one\nfamily residence, the first $10,000 of principal debt secured by the mortgage\nis deducted when computing the additional tax. (See section\n642.2\n[b]\nof this Title.)\n** Since the $400,000 mortgage is of real property which is\nprincipally improved with a residential dwelling unit, Bank X, the mortgagee, must pay the special additional tax. (See section\n642.2\n[b]\nof this Title.)\n\nExample 2: Same facts as in Example 1, except that the first unit in\nthe building is sold on February 1, 1993. Since the first unit is sold more\nthan two years after the construction mortgage was recorded, no credit is\nallowed. Example 3: Same facts as in Example 1, except that the construction\nmortgage was recorded on May 1, 1989. Since the construction mortgage was\nrecorded prior to July 1, 1989, the credit is allowed regardless of the fact\nthat the first unit of the condominium is sold more than two years after the\ndate that the construction mortgage was recorded. Also, the City of New York tax payable on the recording of\nthe construction mortgage would be $12,500 based on the rate in effect on May\n1, 1989, resulting in the credit with respect to such tax being $1,250 (10\npercent × 12,500). Footnotes\n* Since the real property covered by the mortgage is a one\nfamily residence, the first $10,000 of principal debt secured by the mortgage\nis deducted when computing the additional tax. (See section\n642.2\n[b]\nof this Title.)\n** Since the $400,000 mortgage is of real property which is\nprincipally improved with a residential dwelling unit, Bank X, the mortgagee, must pay the special additional tax. (See section\n642.2\n[b]\nof this Title.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n651.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
