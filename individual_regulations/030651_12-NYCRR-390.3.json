Tit. 12 § 390.3 - Computations by actuary\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The actuary shall make his computation as of the date of hearing when the lump\nsum is granted. (b) The actuary\nshall base his computations upon the survivorship annuitants' table of\nmortality, the remarriage tables of the Dutch Royal Insurance Institution and\ninterest at 31/2 per centum per annum on claims based on accidents occurring up\nto and including June 30, 1939, and at three per centum per annum on claims\nbased on accidents occurring thereafter, provided that this interest rate shall\nnot apply to computations made under section\n392.2\nof this Title. (c) (1)\n\nIn\ncomputing a lump-sum payment to a widow for all of the future payments due her, the actuary shall take into account the probability of the widow receiving the\ntwo years' remarriage payment. (2)\n\nIn computing the interval of suspension of payments where a commuted partial\nlump sum is awarded in death cases, the factors of survivorship and interest\nshall be taken into account, but not the probability of remarriage. (d) In computing a lump-sum\npayment to one or more dependents in cases involving the maximum compensation\nof 662/3 percent of wages, the actuary shall consider the required reduction to\nthe various dependents. (e) In\ncomputing a lump-sum payment to a claimant who has been awarded compensation\nunder subdivision 3 of section\n15\nof\nthe Workers' Compensation Law, the actuary shall assume the award to survive\nunless it be established that the claimant is then without dependents under\nsubdivision 4 of section 15, except as provided in section\n27\nof\nthe Workers' Compensation Law. (f) (1)\n\nIn death cases in which death occurs\nprior to July 1, 1937, and in disability cases where the accident occurs prior\nto July 1, 1937, in commuting compensation under section\n17\nof\nthe Workers' Compensation Law, the actuary shall make his computations as of\nthe date the commutation is ordered, upon the basis that all past-due\ninstallments of compensation since the date of death, and in disability cases\nsince the date of accident, are to be paid in full. (2)\n\nIn cases in which accident or death\noccurs on or after July 1, 1937, the actuary shall make his computations as of\nthe date of death, except in case of a resident alien about to become\nnonresident and where a previous death award has been made, the commutation\nshall be made as of the date of nonresidence. (L. 1937, ch. 110.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n390.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
