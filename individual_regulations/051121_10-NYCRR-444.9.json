These revenues must be reported at the hospital's full established rates, regardless of the amounts actually collected.

Included in daily hospital services\nare the regular room, dietary and nursing services, minor medical and surgical\nsupplies, medical social services, and the use of certain equipment and\nfacilities for which the hospital does not customarily make a separate\ncharge.

This group of accounts (3010 - 3290) is used to report\nthe gross revenues, measured in terms of the hospital's full established rates\nearned from daily hospital services provided to patients who are in an acute\nphase of illness but not to the degree which requires the concentrated and\ncontinuous observation and care provided in the intensive care units of a\nhospital.

There cannot be a\nconcurrent sharing of nursing staff between an intensive care type unit and\nunits or areas furnishing different levels or types of care. However, two or\nmore intensive care type units that concurrently share nursing staff can be\nreported as one combined intensive care type unit if all other criteria are\nmet. Float nurses (nurses who work in different units on an as-needed basis)\ncan be utilized in the intensive care type unit. (ii)\n\nThere must be specific written policies\nthat include criteria for admission to, and discharge from, the unit.

Not included are general support personnel such as ward\nclerks, custodians and housekeeping personnel. (v) The unit must be equipped with, or have\navailable for immediate use, lifesaving equipment necessary to treat the\ncritically ill patients for which it is designed.
