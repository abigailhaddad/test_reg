  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.2 - Accounting entity\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1110 ]\nA fundamental reporting concept\nis that of the accounting entity or unit. For reporting purposes, the hospital\nis presumed to be an entity capable of buying, selling and taking other\neconomic actions which are to be accounted for separately from the personal\naffairs of those responsible for the hospital's administration. The hospital\nitself is the primary unit for which the accounting records are maintained. However, most departments of the hospital usually assume sufficient importance\nto require separate treatment as subordinate entities or units of\naccountability for planning and control purposes. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n442.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
