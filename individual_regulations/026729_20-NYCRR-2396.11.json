(1)\nACH debit, ACH\ncredit and fedwire taxpayers. The mailing rules specified in section\n691\nof the Tax Law and in regulations\npromulgated thereunder shall not be applicable to returns filed and payments\nmade by taxpayers participating in the program and electing the ACH debit, ACH\ncredit or fedwire payment option. Instead, such taxpayers (including\neducational organizations and health care providers voluntarily participating)\nshall be deemed to have timely filed their return when they comply with the\napplicable filing requirements described in section\n2396.3, 2396.7\nor\n2396.9\nof this Part. Such taxpayers shall be deemed to have timely paid the tax when\nthe department's depository bank receives the payment of tax on or before\napplicable due date. (2)\n\nCertified\ncheck taxpayers. The mailing rules specified in section\n691\nof the Tax Law and in regulations\npromulgated thereunder shall be applicable to returns filed and payments made\nby taxpayers participating in the program and electing the certified check\npayment option, subject to the following: (i) taxpayers (other than educational organizations and health care providers\nvoluntarily participating) utilizing the certified check option shall be deemed\nto have timely filed their return and paid the tax if they mail or deliver\ntheir return and a certified check for their tax liability on or before the\nsecond business day prior to the otherwise applicable due date; (ii)\neducational organizations and health\ncare providers voluntarily participating and utilizing the certified check\npayment option shall be deemed to have timely filed their return and paid the\ntax if they mail or deliver their return and a certified check for their tax\nliability on or before the first business day following the otherwise\napplicable due date. (b) Penalty for failure to enroll. When a\ntaxpayer required to participate in the program fails to enroll in the program\nin accordance with the provisions of section\n2396.4\n(b) of this Part, such taxpayer shall pay a penalty equal to $5,000; provided, however, that if such taxpayer enrolls in the program within 20 calendar days\nafter notification of the assessment of such penalty is sent by the department\nby certified mail, then such penalty shall be abated. Where the taxpayer\ncontinues to fail to enroll in the program after such 20-day period, the\ntaxpayer shall pay an additional $500 if such failure is for not more than one\nmonth, with an additional $500 for each additional month or part thereof during\nwhich such failure continues. (c) Reasonable cause. (1)\n\nGeneral rules. (i) Where a taxpayer participating in the\nprogram nonwillfully fails to file a withholding tax return or to pay\nwithholding tax at the time and in the manner required by this Part (see\nsection\n685[f] of the Tax Law for\nthe addition to tax), or where a taxpayer required to participate in the\nprogram fails to enroll at the time and in the manner required by this Part, the following penalty, addition or additions to tax set forth in section\n9\nor\n685\nof the Tax Law must be imposed, as\napplicable, unless it is shown that such failure was due to reasonable cause\nand not due to willful neglect: (a) failure\nto enroll in the Electronic Funds Program in accordance with the provisions of\nsection\n2396.4\n(b) of this Part (see section\n9[h] of the Tax Law for the\npenalty); (b) failure to file a\nwithholding tax return on or before the last date prescribed for filing by this\n\nPart (see section\n685[a][1] of the Tax Law\nfor the addition to tax); (c) failure to pay withholding tax shown on the return on or before the last day\nprescribed for paying by this Part (see section\n685[a][2] of the Tax Law\nfor the addition to tax); or\n(d) failure to pay withholding tax required to be shown on a withholding tax return\nwithin 10 days of the date of notice and demand therefor (see section\n685[a][3] of the Tax Law\nfor the addition to tax). In the event that this penalty or these additions to tax have\nbeen imposed and it is later determined that any such failure was due to\nreasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, all or part of such penalty or\nadditions to tax will be cancelled. The absence of willful neglect alone is not\nsufficient grounds for not imposing the penalty or additions to tax or for\ncancelling the penalty or additions to tax. (ii)\n\nAll of the facts alleged as a basis for\nreasonable cause and absence of willful neglect may be required to be\naffirmatively shown in a written statement made by the taxpayer against whom\nthe additions to tax have been assessed or are assessable. Where such taxpayer\nis unable to provide such statement or does not have a personal knowledge of\nsuch facts, a showing of reasonable cause and absence of willful neglect may be\nmade on behalf of the taxpayer by an individual with a personal knowledge of\nsuch facts. In determining whether reasonable cause and absence of willful\nneglect exists, in addition to an evaluation of such facts, the taxpayer's\nprevious compliance record with respect to all of the taxes imposed pursuant to\nthe Tax Law may be taken into account. (2)\n\nReasonable cause grounds. The following\nexemplify grounds for reasonable cause and absence of willful neglect, where\nclearly established by or on behalf of the taxpayer: (i) taxpayer inability to access the\nelectronic payment reporting system on the required due date because of a\nsystems failure beyond the taxpayer's control (i.e., a failure in the\nelectronic payment reporting system); (ii)\ndepartment or department depository bank\nsystems failure preventing proper receipt of a payment of tax, or preventing\nproper reconciliation of a payment of tax with a return; (iii)\ntaxpayer inability to timely complete a\nprogram transaction, due to any other circumstances beyond its control, but\nonly if all possible remedial action is immediately initiated; or\n(iv)\nthe circumstances set forth in section\n2392.1\nof this\n\nTitle, to the extent applicable.
