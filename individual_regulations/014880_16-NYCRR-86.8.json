  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 86.8 - Exhibit 7: local ordinances\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\napplicant shall submit a list of all local ordinances, laws, resolutions, regulations, standards, and other requirements applicable to the proposed\nfacility, together with a statement that the location of the facility as\nproposed conforms to all such local legal provisions, except any that the\napplicant requests that the commission refuse to apply because, as applied to\nthe proposed facility, such local legal provision is unreasonably restrictive\nin view of the existing technology, factors of costs or economics, or the needs\nof consumers whether located inside or outside any particular municipality. If\nthe applicant desires the commission to refuse to apply one or more local legal\nprovisions, it shall submit a statement justifying the request. (b) The statement of justification shall show\nthat the request cannot be obviated by design changes to the proposed facility, the request is the minimum necessary, and the adverse impacts of granting the\nrequest are mitigated to the maximum extent practicable. The statement shall\ninclude a demonstration: (1)\nfor requests\ngrounded in the existing technology, that there are technological limitations\n(including governmentally imposed technological limitations) related to\nnecessary facility component bulk, layout, process or materials that make\ncompliance by the applicant technically impossible, impracticable or otherwise\nunreasonable; (2)\nfor requests\ngrounded in factors of costs or economics (likely involving economic modeling), that the costs to consumers associated with applying the local legal provision\noutweigh the benefits of applying such provision; and\n(3)\nfor requests grounded in the needs of\nconsumers, that the needs of consumers for the facility outweigh the impacts on\nthe community that would result from refusal to apply the local legal\nprovision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n86.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
