In general, financing will not be approved for\nprojects that anticipate a return of less than one full-time, permanent job for\neach $15,000 of program assistance; (3)\nthe availability of other funding\nsources; (4)\nthe percentage of the\ntotal project cost that the corporation is being asked to finance. Typically, the corporation's participation (including all funding sources over which the\ncorporation has discretion) will not exceed 33 percent of the total estimated\nproject cost. The corporation may permit program financing in excess of 33\npercent of total project cost in appropriate circumstances, as determined by\nthe corporation in light of such factors as the project's debt servicing\ncapability, the relative importance of the project's public purpose and the\nlikely economic and sociological consequences of a failure to authorize such\nadditional program financing; (5)\nthe ability of the applicant to carry out the project in a manner consistent\nwith the program; (6)\nthe size of\nthe applicant's equity contribution. In general, the corporation expects an\napplicant's equity contribution to a project to be at least 10 percent of the\ntotal project cost; (7)\nthe\napplicant's financial circumstances; (8)\nthe impact of the project on the local\ncommunity; (9)\nthe ability of the\napplicant to repay the project loan or the bank loan; and\n(10)\nthe availability of adequate collateral\nto secure the project loan or the bank loan. Additionally, the corporation shall consider the availability\nof program funds. (b) Applications for project grants (other\nthan commercial revitalization project grants) shall be evaluated based upon\nthe corporation's reasonable estimation of the suitability of the contemplated\nimprovements which are the subject of the feasibility study or preliminary\nplanning to fulfill the criteria listed in section\n4212.3\nof this Part and in\nsubdivision (a) of this section.
