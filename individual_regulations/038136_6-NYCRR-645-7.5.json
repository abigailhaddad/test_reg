  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 645-7.5 - Procedures to challenge a regulatory fee\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any person having a question about the\nbasis for an annual regulatory fee or how it was calculated, may contact the\ncommission staff to request an explanation. The commission staff shall promptly\nexplain the computation of the regulatory fee. (b) Any person wishing to challenge the\namount of a regulatory fee must make a request for redetermination on such\nforms as the commission may prescribe. Such a request shall be mailed by\ncertified mail or hand delivered to the commission within 30 days of the date\nwhen any such fee became due and payable. The failure to make such a request\nwithin 30 days from the date when the fee became due and payable shall bar\nfurther consideration of that fee unless changed circumstances require\nreconsideration of that fee in a subsequent fee year. The failure of the\ncommission staff to explain the basis for the fee in accordance with paragraph\n(a) of this section shall not be grounds for the extension of the 30-day period\nprovided herein. (c) Any request\nfor reconsideration must, at a minimum, be accompanied by an explanation of why\na reduction in the amount of the regulatory fee imposed is appropriate, a\nstatement of what the revised regulatory fee should be, and appropriate\ndocumentary evidence to support the claim. Any evidence submitted relative to\nthe size or configuration of a dock or wharf shall be verified by either the\nowner or the owner's agent, or shall be based upon a survey prepared by a\nlicensed land surveyor. (d) The\ncommission shall not consider any request for redetermination if a person fails\nto: (1)\nmake the request within the 30-day\ntime period provided herein; and\n(2)\nmake payment in full of the undisputed\namount of the regulatory fee. (e) Upon receipt of a request for\nredetermination, the commission staff shall determine whether the initial\ndetermination should be revised. The staff determination shall be made within\n30 days of receipt of the request for redetermination, unless the staff shall\ndetermine that it has insufficient information to act upon the request for\nredetermination. In such an event, the staff shall, within such 30-day period, mail to the person initiating the request for redetermination a request for\nfurther information, specifying the nature of the information that must be\nsubmitted. The staff determination shall be made within 30 days following\nreceipt of all of the requested information. In the event that any person\ninitiating a request for a determination shall fail to respond to a request for\nfurther information within 30 days from the request by staff, the commission\nmay deem the request for redetermination abandoned and assess a penalty on the\ndisputed amount from the date the 30-day period expired. (f) A person shall have a right to appeal to\nthe commission from any determination issued by the staff in response to a\nrequest for redetermination. Such an appeal must be initiated within 30 days\nfollowing the mailing by staff of the determination rendered pursuant to\nsubdivision (e) of this section. The appeal shall be made in writing, and shall\nbe mailed by certified mail or hand delivered to the commission within 30 days\nfrom the receipt of the staff determination. Such an appeal must be accompanied\nby an explanation as to why a reduction in the regulatory fee is appropriate, a\nstatement of what the revised regulatory fee should be, appropriate verified\ndocumentary evidence, together with an explanation of why the commission staff\nhas not properly responded to the issues raised in support of the initial\nrequest for redetermination. (g) The commission staff shall have 30 days to respond in writing to any such\nappeal. The appeal and the response of commission staff shall be presented to\nthe commission at the next regular meeting following either the response by\nstaff or the expiration of 30 days following the initiation of the appeal, whichever occurs first. The commission shall, by order of the chairman or two\nmembers of the commission, determine whether to allow an oral presentation in\nconnection with the appeal. In such an event, the person initiating the appeal\nshall be notified of such fact not less than five business days prior to the\nmeeting of the commission. (h) Following the initiation of an appeal, no party shall directly or indirectly\nthrough a representative communicate with the commission or any member of the\ncommission relative to any issue pending in the appeal without providing notice\nand an opportunity for all parties to participate. (i) If any issues of fact are required to be\ndetermined on such an appeal, the commission may, in its discretion, refer the\nappeal to a hearing officer, who shall conduct a hearing on said issues in\naccordance with Subpart 645-6 of this Part. In such event, the appeal shall be\nheard by the commission at the next regular meeting following the delivery to\nthe commission of the hearing officer's report. (j) The commission shall render a decision\nregarding any such appeal no later than the next regular meeting following the\ndate on which the appeal is heard. Any such decision shall be in writing, shall\nbe mailed to the appellant and any attorney of record by certified mail, and\nshall take effect five days from the date of mailing. The commission's decision\nmust be made upon consideration of the complete record, must be supported by\nsubstantial evidence and shall state the reasons for the decision.
