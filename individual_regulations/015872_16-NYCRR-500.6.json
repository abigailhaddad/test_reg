  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 500.6 - Registration of meters\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Displacement type. The registration on the meter dial shall indicate the\nquantity recorded to be not less than 98.5 percent nor more than 101.5 percent\nof the water actually passed through the meter while it is being tested at any\nrate of flow within the limits specified herein under \"normal test flow\nlimits\". At the \"minimum test flow\" rate to the lowest normal test flow rate as\nset forth in the following table, the meter shall register not less than 95\npercent and not more than 101 percent of the water that actually passes through\nit. The meter shall show proper sensitivity when tested at the rate of flow set\nforth under \"minimum test flow\" as provided in section\n500.5\nof this Part. Size (inches)\n\nNormal test flow\nlimits (gallons per minute)\n\nMinimum test flow (gallons per\nminute)\n1/2....... 1 to 15....... 1/4\n1/2 × 3/4....... 1 to 15....... 1/4\n5\n/\n8....... 1 to 20....... 1/4\n5\n/\n8\n× 3/4....... 1 to 20....... 1/4\n3/4....... 2 to 30....... 1/2\n1....... 3 to 50....... 3/4\n1 1/2....... 5 to 100....... 11/2\n2....... 8 to 160....... 2\n3....... 16 to 315....... 4\n4....... 28 to 500....... 7\n6....... 48 to 1,000....... 12\n(b) Current type. The registration on the meter dial shall indicate the\nquantity recorded to be not less than 98 percent nor more than 102 percent of\nthe water actually passed through the meter while it is being tested at any\nrate of flow within the limits specified herein under \"normal test flow\nlimits\". The meter shall show proper sensitivity when tested at the rate of\nflow set forth under \"minimum test flow\" as provided in section\n500.5\nof this Part. Size (inches)\n\nNormal test flow\nlimits (gallons per minute)\n\nMinimum test flow (gallons per\nminute)\n1 1/2....... 12 to 100....... 11/2\n2....... 35 to 100....... 30\n3....... 40 to 250....... 35\n4....... 50 to 500....... 45\n5....... 75 to 90....... 70\n6....... 90 to 1,200....... 85\n8....... 100 to 1,500....... 90\n10....... 125 to 2,000....... 110\n12....... 150 to 2,800....... 140\n(c) Compound type. (1)\n\nThe registration on the meter dial shall\nindicate the quantity recorded to be not less than 97 percent nor more than 103\npercent of the water actually passed through the meter while it is being tested\nat any rate of flow within the limits specified under \"normal test flow\nlimits\", except in the registration of flows within the \"changeover\" from\nby-pass meter to mainline meter. The registration at these rates of flow shall\nbe not less than 90 percent and not more than 103 percent. The difference in\nthe rate of flow at the beginning and at the end of the \"changeover\" shall not\nexceed the figures given in the following table: Size (inches)\n\nGallons per minute\n1 1/2....... 20\n2....... 20\n3....... 30\n4....... 30\n6....... 40\n8....... 75\n10....... 100\n12....... 620\n(2)\n\nThe beginning of the \"changeover\" is when\nthe accuracy of registration falls below 97 percent, due to the automatic valve\nmechanism, and the end of the \"changeover\" is when the accuracy of registration\nagain reaches 97 percent. (3)\n\nThe\nmeter shall show proper sensitivity when tested at the rate of flow set forth\nunder \"minimum test flow\" as provided in section\n500.5\nof this Part. Size, main meter\n(inches)\n\nNormal test flow\nlimits (gallons per minute)\n\nMinimum test flow (gallons per\nminute)\n1 1/2....... 2 to\n100....... 1/2\n2....... 2 to\n160....... 1/2\n3....... 4 to\n320....... 1\n4....... 6 to\n500....... 11/2\n6....... 10 to\n1,000....... 3\n8....... 16 to\n1,600....... 4\n10....... 32 to\n2,300....... 8\n12....... 32 to\n3,100....... 14\n(d) Fire-service type. (1)\n\nRegistration on the meter dials shall\nindicate the quantity recorded to be not less than 97 percent nor more than 103\npercent of the water actually passed through the meter while it is being tested\nat any rate of flow within the limits specified under \"normal test flow\nlimits\", except in the registration of flows within the \"changeover\" from\nby-pass meter to the mainline meter. The registration at these rates of flow\nshall be not less than 85 percent. The difference in the rate of flow at the\nbeginning and at the end of the \"changeover\" shall not exceed the figures given\nin the following table: Size (inches)\n\nGallons per minute\n3....... 40\n4....... 60\n6....... 130\n8....... 210\n10....... 300\n12....... 620\n(2)\n\nThe beginning of the \"changeover\" is when\nthe accuracy of registration falls below 97 percent due to the automatic valve\nmechanism, and the end of the \"changeover\" is when the accuracy of registration\nagain reaches 97 percent.
