  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 4.7 - Interlocutory review\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Interlocutory review of a ruling by a presiding officer will be available and\nmay be sought only in extraordinary circumstances or in case a request for\npermission to intervene has been denied. Normally, the prospect of parties\nincurring additional workload in consequence of a ruling will not in itself\nconstitute extraordinary circumstances. (b) Any request for interlocutory review must\nbe filed within 15 days of the issuance of the ruling to which it\npertains. (c) In addition to\ncomplying with the requirements applicable to motions generally (see section\n3.6\nof this Title), a motion for\ninterlocutory review shall: (1)\nidentify\nspecifically the ruling to be reviewed, and, if the ruling was issued from the\nbench, set forth as an appendix the pertinent pages of the transcript; and\n(2)\nidentify the extraordinary\ncircumstances alleged to warrant interlocutory review. (d) A party need not file an interlocutory\nappeal to preserve its right to object to a ruling in its briefs. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n4.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
