  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8004.9 - Recognizance Hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Following\nexecution of a parole warrant, for any releasee remaining in custody pursuant\nto such warrant, a recognizance hearing will be held. The recognizance hearing\nshall be presided over by a court of law as set forth in subdivision (b) of\nthis section and the conduct of such hearing is the responsibility of that\ncourt. Except as provided in paragraph (3) of subdivision (b) of this section, the recognizance hearing may not be combined with any other proceeding nor\nshall the court decide any subject other than the issue of release on\nrecognizance in regard to the parole warrant. (b) The releasee for whom a recognizance\nhearing must be held will be presented for such hearing as follows: (1)\n\nFor any releasee alleged to have\ncommitted a violation of a condition of release in an important respect in the\ncity of New York, the authorized officer shall present the releasee to the\ncriminal court of the city of New York or the supreme court criminal term in\nthe county where the violation is alleged to have been committed for a\nrecognizance hearing within twenty-four hours of the execution of the warrant. If no such court of record is available to conduct any business of any type\nwithin twenty-four hours of the execution of the warrant, the recognizance\nhearing shall commence on the next day such a court in the jurisdiction is\navailable to conduct any business of any type. (2)\n\nFor any releasee alleged to have\ncommitted a violation of a condition of release in an important respect outside\nof the city of New York, the authorized officer shall present the releasee to a\ncounty court, district court or city court in the county or city where the\nviolation is alleged to have been committed for a recognizance hearing. If no\nsuch court of record is available to conduct any business of any type within\ntwenty-four hours of the execution of the warrant, the recognizance hearing\nshall commence on the next day such court is available to conduct any business\nof any type. (3)\n\nIf the violation\ncharge or charges involve conduct that would constitute a new felony or\nmisdemeanor offense, such recognizance hearing may be held at the same time as\na proceeding pursuant to Article 530 of the Criminal Procedure Law for any\nwarrant issued by the Department prior to such proceeding. If at the proceeding\npursuant to Article 530 of the Criminal Procedure Law the court imposes bail on\nthe new alleged criminal offense or commits the releasee to the custody of the\nsheriff pursuant to such article and the releasee secures release by paying\nbail or under non-monetary conditions or by operation of law, then the releasee\nshall not be detained further based solely on the warrant issued by the\n\nDepartment. If the Department issues a warrant for a non-technical violation\nfor alleged criminal conduct that has already been the subject of a court's\norder pursuant to Article 530 of the Criminal Procedure Law, then within\ntwenty-four hours of execution of the warrant the releasee shall be provided a\nrecognizance hearing, provided, however, that if no court as provided in this\nsection is available to conduct any business of any type within twenty-four\nhours of the execution of the warrant, then the recognizance hearing shall\ncommence on the next day such court is available to conduct any business of any\ntype. (4)\n\nAuthorized officer shall\nmean the superintendent or other person in charge of the jail, penitentiary, lockup or detention pen in which the releasee was detained under the authority\nof the parole warrant, or their authorized staff. In its discretion, however, the Department may permit other peace officers to function as authorized\nofficers for this purpose. (5)\n\nThe\ntime within which the authorized officer is to present the releasee for\npurposes of a recognizance hearing and in which to commence such hearing shall\nbe extended where reasonable to ensure that such releasee is presented to the\nappropriate court as identified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this\nsubdivision. (6)\n\nWhere the\nreleasee's custody is pursuant to the parole warrant and they are not detained\nin the county within which the violations are alleged to have occurred, except\nas may otherwise be deemed appropriate by the Board or Department due to case\nspecific circumstances, execution of the warrant shall not be deemed completed\nwithin the meaning of this section until their known reception in the\nappropriate county, provided however, that for releasees detained pursuant to a\nparole warrant within the city of New York, the warrant may be deemed executed\nupon their exclusive and known custody pursuant to such warrant within any\ncounty therein. (7)\n\nThe failure of\nthe authorized officer to present the releasee within the periods set forth in\nthis paragraph shall have no effect on the validity of the parole warrant or\nthe parole violation charges and shall not in itself require release, but may\nprovide basis for an application to a court of law, on notice to the Department\nand Board of Parole, for an order compelling the appropriate\nproduction. (c) The\npurpose of the recognizance hearing is to determine whether the releasee is to\nbe detained pending a preliminary or final revocation hearing, and if not, what\nnon-monetary conditions in the community shall be imposed which will reasonably\nassure the releasee's appearance at the preliminary or final revocation\nhearing. (d) At the hearing there\nis a presumption of release on recognizance, which release is to be ordered by\nthe court unless it finds that: (1)\nthe\nreleasee currently presents a substantial risk of willfully failing to appear\nat preliminary or final revocation hearings; and\n(2)\nthat no non-monetary condition or\ncombination of conditions in the community will reasonably assure the\nreleasee's appearance at the preliminary or final revocation\nhearings. (e) If the\ncourt makes the findings in subdivision (d) of this section the releasee is to\nbe ordered detained until the conclusion of all parole revocation proceedings\nand the issuance of the final decision therefrom, and as may be consistent with\nany decision revoking release and directing the releasee's\nreincarceration. (f) If the court\nfinds that the standards identified in subdivision (d) of this section for an\norder directing the releasee's continued detention are not met, the releasee is\nto be ordered released and such order must include the least restrictive\nnon-monetary conditions that will reasonably assure the releasee's appearance\nat subsequent preliminary and final revocation hearings, provided, however: (1)\n\nThe releasee shall not be required to pay\nfor any part of the cost of such conditions imposed by the court. (2)\n\nThe Board and Department retain\nindependent authority to impose conditions of release, including, but not\nlimited to, conditions intended to support a likelihood that the releasee will\nappear at the preliminary and final revocation hearings and appearances, and\nany other conditions related to community supervision, whether applicable to\nthe period following the recognizance hearing or thereafter. Violation of these\nconditions for any such releasee may be considered and charged as violations of\nthe conditions of release. (g) The releasee has the right to\nrepresentation by counsel at the recognizance hearing. (h) The Department shall be a party to any\nrecognizance hearing relevant, in whole or in part, to a parole warrant. (1)\n\nThe Department should demonstrate to the\nrecognizance court that the executed warrant had been properly issued, and\nshould inform the court of the following: (i) that there is probable cause to believe the releasee violated one or more of\nthe conditions of their release in an important respect; (ii)\nthat such fact was reported to a member\nof the Board or a designated officer identified in section\n8004.2; (iii)\nthat upon such report, a Board member\nor designated officer issued the parole warrant; and\n(iv)\nthe violative behavior the releasee is\nbelieved to have engaged in. (2)\n\nThe Department shall present information\nto the court regarding the alleged violations, and the releasee's community\nsupervision record to the extent practicable and where such information is\nrelevant to the purpose of the recognizance hearing. (3)\n\nInasmuch as the court may consider such\nfactors as evidence of the releasee's employment, family and community ties\nincluding length of residency in the community, history of reporting in a\ntimely fashion to their parole officer, and any other evidence relevant to\ntheir stability, the Department should be prepared to offer such available\ninformation to the court. (4)\n\nWhere\npracticable and if an alleged violation is the subject of a pending criminal\nprosecution, the Department shall coordinate with the office of the district\nattorney to ensure that relevant information regarding such alleged violation\nis presented to the court. (i) At the time of the hearing the Department\nshall serve the releasee with the notice of violation if they were not\npreviously served with such notice, and: (1)\n\nThe Department may also provide a copy of the notice to releasee's counsel at\nsuch hearing. (2)\n\nThe notice, amendment thereto or some other document must be served on the releasee at such\ntime apprising them of the time and place of the preliminary revocation\nhearing, or if a preliminary hearing is not required, the time and place of the\nfinal revocation hearing, to any extent such information had not previously\nbeen provided to the releasee. Such information shall be in accord with\nrelevant provisions in Part 8005 of this Title and must account for the court's\norder stemming from the recognizance hearing. (3)\n\nThe notice, amendment thereto or some\nother document should be served on the releasee at such time stating what\nconditions of release are alleged to have been violated and in what manner, to\nany extent such information had not previously been provided to the\nreleasee. (j) In all\ncases the Department should request that a written order regarding recognizance\nbe issued and promptly served on the Department following such issuance. The\ncourt is required to explain its decision on recognizance on the record or in\nwriting. (k) In the event a\nrecognizance hearing is held without the participation of responsible\n\nDepartment staff, such fact should be reported as soon as practicable to\n\nCounsels for the Department and for the Board of Parole, but the failure to so\nreport shall neither affect the court's recognizance order nor prevent further\nlegal proceedings regarding such. (l) Nothing within this section shall be\nconstrued as expanding the purpose of, and appropriate scope of inquiry at, a\nrecognizance hearing as set forth in in subdivisions (c) and (d) of this\nsection, and the recognizance court remains without authority to rule on the\nvalidity of a notice of violation, parole warrant, or any other aspect of the\nparole revocation case and its continuation. The evidence presented at the\nrecognizance hearing shall not constrain the Department to any position or\nrepresentation in the parole revocation process, nor may the court's order or\nfindings on recognizance affect the preliminary or final parole revocation\ndecisions, including the determinations by the presiding officer regarding time\nassessments that may be imposed upon any sustained violations.
