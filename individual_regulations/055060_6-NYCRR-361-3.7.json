  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 361-3.7 - Pathogen and vector attraction reduction criteria\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pathogen reduction. (1)\n\nOne of the following Class A alternatives\nmust be used to reduce pathogen content before the material leaves the\nfacility. Alternative 2 is not applicable for composting and alternative 4 can\nonly be used if the process cannot produce operational data that could be used\nto meet another pathogen reduction (PR) alternative. (i) Class A - alternative 1. At the time of\nproduct use or disposal, either the density of fecal coliform in the product is\nless than 1,000 most probable number per gram of total solids (dry weight\nbasis) or the density of salmonella sp. bacteria in the product is less than 3\nmost probable number per 4 grams of total solids (dry weight basis). In\naddition, the waste must be treated by one of the following processes: (a) Composting. Using the windrow composting\nmethod, the waste is maintained under aerobic conditions during the compost\nprocess. A minimum of 5 turnings is required during a period of 15 consecutive\ndays when the temperature of the waste is not less than 55° C. Using the\naerated static pile composting method or the within-vessel composting method, the temperature of the waste is maintained at 55° C or higher for at least\nthree consecutive days. (b) Heat\ndrying. Waste is dried by direct or indirect contact with hot gases to reduce\nthe moisture content of the waste to 10 percent or lower. One of the following\nmust be achieved: (1)\neither the temperature\nof the waste particles must exceed 80° C; or\n(2)\nthe wet bulb temperature of the gas in\ncontact with the waste as it leaves the dryer must exceed 80° C. (c) Heat treatment. Liquid waste\nis heated to a temperature of 180° C or higher for at least 30\nminutes. (d) Thermophilic aerobic\ndigestion. Liquid waste is agitated with air or oxygen to maintain aerobic\nconditions and the mean cell residence time of the waste is at least 10 days at\n55° C or greater. (e) Beta ray\nirradiation. Waste is irradiated with beta rays from an accelerator at dosages\nof at least 1.0 megarad at room temperature (approximately 20°\nC). (f) Gamma ray irradiation. Waste is irradiated with gamma rays from certain isotopes, such as cobalt 60\nand cesium 137, at dosages of at least 1.0 megarad at room temperature\n(approximately 20° C). (g) Pasteurization. The temperature of the waste is maintained at 70° C or\nhigher for 30 minutes or longer. (h) Other methods. Other methods or operating\nconditions can be approved by the department if the department determines that\npathogens are reduced to an extent equivalent to the reduction achieved by the\nabove methods. (ii)\n\nClass A - Alternative 2. At the time of product use or disposal, either the\ndensity of fecal coliform in the product must be less than 1,000 Most Probable\n\nNumber per gram of total solids (dry weight basis) or the density of Salmonella\nsp. bacteria in the product must be less than three most probable number per\nfour grams of total solids (dry weight basis). In addition, the temperature of\nthe waste must be maintained at a specific value for a period of time, as\nfollows: (a) When the percent solids of the\nwaste is seven percent or higher, the temperature of the waste must be 50°\nC or higher, the time period must be 20 minutes or longer, and the temperature\nand time period must be determined using the following equation, except when\nsmall particles of waste are heated by either warmed gases or an immiscible\nliquid. D =\n131,700,000/10\n0.1400t\n\nWhere, D = time in days. t = temperature in degrees Celsius. (b) When the percent solids of the waste is\nseven percent or higher and small particles of waste are heated by either\nwarmed gases or an immiscible liquid, the temperature and time period must be\ndetermined using the equation in clause (a) of this subparagraph. The\ntemperature of the waste must be 50° C or greater and the time period must\nbe 15 seconds or longer. (c) When\nthe percent solids of the waste is less than seven percent and the time period\nis at least 15 seconds, but less than 30 minutes, the temperature and time\nperiod must be determined using the equation in clause (a) of this\nsubparagraph. (d) When the percent\nsolids of the waste is less than seven percent, the temperature of the waste is\n50° C or higher, and the time period is 30 minutes or longer, the\ntemperature and time period must be determined using the following equation: D = 50,070,000/10\n0.1400\nt\n\nWhere, D = time in days. t = temperature in degrees Celsius. (iii)\n\nClass A - Alternative 3. At\nthe time of product use or disposal, either the density of fecal coliform in\nthe product must be less than 1,000 Most Probable Number per gram of total\nsolids (dry weight basis) or the density of Salmonella sp. bacteria in the\nproduct must be less than three Most Probable Number per four grams of total\nsolids (dry weight basis). In addition, the following conditions must be\nsatisfied: (a) The pH of the waste must be\nraised to above 12 and remain above 12 for at least 72 hours. (b) The temperature of the waste must remain\nabove 52° C for 12 hours or longer during the period that the pH of the\nwaste is above 12. (c) At the end\nof the 72-hour period during which the pH of the waste is above 12, the waste\nmust be air dried to achieve a percent solids in the waste greater than 50\npercent. (iv)\n\nClass A -\nAlternative 4. At the time of product use or disposal, either the density of\nfecal coliform in the product must be less than 1,000 Most Probable Number per\ngram of total solids (dry weight basis) or the density of salmonella sp. bacteria in the product must be less than three Most Probable Number per four\ngrams of total solids (dry weight basis). In addition, the following conditions\nmust be satisfied: (a) The density of enteric\nviruses in the product must be less than one plaque-forming unit per four grams\nof total solids (dry weight basis). (b) The density of viable helminth ova in the\nproduct must be less than one per four grams of total solids (dry weight\nbasis). (b) Vector attraction reduction. (1)\n\nOne of the following vector attraction\nreduction methods must be achieved before the material leaves the facility. Vector attraction reduction methods, except the methods found in subparagraphs\n361-3.7(b)(2)(vi)-(viii) of this Subpart, must be met either after meeting the\npathogen reduction requirements or at the same time the pathogen reduction\nrequirements are met. (i) The mass of\nvolatile solids in the waste must be reduced by a minimum of 38\npercent. (ii)\n\nIf the volatile\nsolids reduction requirement in subparagraph (i) cannot be met for an\nanaerobically digested waste, vector attraction reduction can be demonstrated\nby anaerobically digesting a portion of the previously digested waste in a\nlaboratory bench-scale unit for 40 additional days at a temperature between 30\nand 37 degrees Celsius. Vector attraction reduction is achieved if the\nbench-scale digestion produces less than a 17 percent reduction in volatile\nsolids content. (iii)\n\nIf the\nvolatile solids reduction requirement in subparagraph (i) cannot be met for an\naerobically digested waste, vector attraction reduction can be demonstrated by\naerobically digesting a portion of the previously digested waste that has a\npercent solids of two percent or less in a laboratory bench-scale unit for an\nadditional 30 days at 20 degrees Celsius. Vector attraction reduction is\nachieved if the bench-scale digestion produces less than a 15 percent reduction\nin volatile solids content. (iv)\n\nThe specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR) for waste treated in an aerobic process\nmust be equal to or less than 1.5 milligrams of oxygen per hour per gram of\ntotal solids (dry weight basis) at a temperature of 20° C. (v) Waste must be treated by an aerobic\nprocess for a minimum of 14 days. Throughout that treatment time, the\ntemperature of the waste must remain higher than 40° C and the average\ntemperature of the waste must be higher than 45° C. (vi)\n\nThe pH of the waste must be raised to 12\nstandard units or higher by alkali addition and, without the addition of more\nalkali, must remain at 12 or higher for two hours, and then must remain at 11.5\nor higher for an additional 22 hours. (vii)\n\nFor waste that does not contain\nuntreated solids generated in a primary wastewater treatment process, the\npercent solids of the waste must be equal to or greater than 75 percent, before\nmixing with other materials, until use. (viii)\n\nFor waste that contains untreated\nsolids generated in a primary wastewater treatment process, the percent solids\nof the waste must be equal to or greater than 90 percent, before mixing with\nother materials, until use.
