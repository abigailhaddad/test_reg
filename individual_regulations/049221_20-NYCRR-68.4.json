Tit. 20 § 68.4 - Manifest document requirement\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 428(2)\n(a) When more than 90 liters of liquors are\ntransported in New York State, the transporter must make or cause to be made, on a form prescribed by the Department of Taxation and Finance, a manifest\ndocument and must cause the operator of the motor vehicle or other means of\ntransport to have in such operator's possession, and such operator must have in\nsuch operator's possession, on such motor vehicle or other means of transport, such manifest document in completed form containing the information set forth\nin this section. Such operator must produce such manifest document for\ninspection at the request of a peace officer, acting pursuant to such peace\nofficer's special duties, a police officer, any representative of the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance or any other person authorized by law to\ninquire into or investigate the transportation of liquors into or in New York\n\nState. For purposes of this Subchapter, transporter\nmeans any\nperson who or which has the use or control, or the right to the use or control, of any means of transportation used in transporting liquors. (For permission to\nuse other than the prescribed manifest document form, see subdivision [f] of\nthis section.)\n(b) (1)\n\nIn addition to any other information\nrequired by the department, a manifest document must contain the following\ninformation: (i) the transporter's name, address, Federal employer identification number and State Liquor Authority\nnumber; (ii)\nthe type of\ntransportation equipment (\ne.g., car, truck, etc.) and the\nvehicle identification number of such equipment; (iii)\nthe name and address of every person\nfrom whom the liquors were received, and where applicable, the State Liquor\n\nAuthority number of each such person; (iv)\nthe date and, if different from\nsubparagraph (iii), the place(s) of receipt of such liquors; (v) the quantity of liquors received (in\nliters); (vi)\nthe name and address\nof every person to whom the liquors will be delivered, and where applicable, the State Liquor Authority number of each such person; (vii)\nthe date, approximate time and, if\ndifferent from subparagraph (vi), the place(s) of delivery of the\nliquors; (viii)\nthe quantity of\nliquors delivered to each person (in liters); and\n(ix)\nwhere the liquors are being imported\ninto New York State, the name and address of the registered distributor\nimporting or causing the liquors to be imported into the State, and that\ndistributor's Department of Taxation and Finance registration number and State\n\nLiquor Authority number. (2)\n\nThe manifest document required by this\nsection must be completed prior to the commencement of any transportation of\nliquors in this State and must be uniquely and consecutively\nnumbered. (c) (1)\n\nWith respect to multiple loadings or\ndeliveries, a separate completed manifest document may be made relating to the\nliquors loaded or delivered at each location or site. Alternatively, multiple\nentries relating to each loading and delivery may be made on the manifest\ndocument prescribed by the department. (2)\n(i) In\nlieu of making multiple entries on the manifest document, there may be appended\nto the completed manifest document, prior to the commencement of any\ntransportation: (a) multiple sections of that\npart of the manifest document prescribed by the department which relates to the\ncircumstance of each loading or delivery; or\n(b) invoices which contain all of the\ninformation required by such part of the manifest document which relates to the\ncircumstance of each loading or delivery. (ii)\n\nEach such section or invoice, as the\ncase may be, in conjunction with the original manifest document must contain\nall of the information required by this section. Each such section or invoice\nis an integral part of the manifest document and must reflect the manifest\ndocument number to which it is appended. (d) If, after the liquors are loaded by the\ntransporter, there are changes with respect to the particulars contained on the\nmanifest document and the transporter has knowledge of such changes, the\nmanifest document must immediately be amended by the transporter to reflect\nsuch changes. (e) Reproductions of\nthe manifest document form prescribed by the Department of Taxation and Finance\nare permitted and are acceptable, provided that they are in the exact same\nformat and if reproduced on paper, are of the same approximate size as the\nprescribed form. Format, as used in this section, refers to\nthe content of information that is required to be included in the manifest and\nthe organization or arrangement of such information. Reproductions may be made\nin hard copy or electronically. See Part 2402 of this Title for taxpayer record\nretention formats. (f) (1)\n\nNotwithstanding the requirement contained\nin subdivision (a) of this section with respect to the making and carrying of a\nmanifest document in the format prescribed by the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance, transporters may apply in writing to the department for permission to\nuse a manifest document in a format different from the prescribed form. The\nparticular format of the manifest document requested for use (for example, an\ninvoice) must accompany the application and must be approved by the department\nprior to its use. Applications for permission to use an alternative format\nshall be submitted to the New York State Tax Department, Office of Tax\n\nEnforcement. (2)\n\nIn all cases, no\nmodification will be permitted if the department finds that the administration\nor the enforcement of the alcoholic beverage taxes on liquors under article 18\nof the Tax Law or subchapter 5 of chapter 20 of title 11 of the Administrative\n\nCode of the City of New York is in any manner hindered or placed in\njeopardy. (g) (1)\n\nThe absence of a manifest document\nprescribed by this section gives rise to the presumption that the liquors being\ntransported are being imported or caused to be imported into this State for\nsale or use in the State by a person other than a registered\ndistributor. (2)\n\nThe absence of the\nplace of delivery of the liquors on the manifest document with respect to\nliquors being imported into the State gives rise to the presumption that such\nliquors are being imported for sale or use in this State. (3)\n(i) The\nabsence of the name of a registered distributor on the manifest document with\nrespect to liquors being imported into the State gives rise to the presumption\nthat such liquors are being imported or caused to be imported into the State\nfor sale or use in the State by a person other than a registered\ndistributor. (ii)\n\nExcept for liquor\ndistributors importing under the special two-week permit, the names of all\nregistered distributors of liquors will be contained in the current listings of\nliquor distributors prepared by the Department of Taxation and Finance. The\ndepartment will periodically make available such a listing to all transporters\nimporting liquors into the State and to all registered liquor distributors. Additionally, the department will make available listings of distributors whose\nregistration has been cancelled or suspended. (4)\n\nSee article 37 of the Tax Law for\ncriminal penalties, and seizure and forfeiture provisions pertaining to the\nimportation of liquors into New York State for sale or use in the State by a\nperson other than a registered distributor. (h) The manifest document required pursuant\nto this section, and any records needed to verify the entries and accuracy of\nthe manifest document, must be retained for a period of three years, and upon\noral or written demand by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance must be made\navailable for use and inspection by the department.
