  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 38.29 - Reports\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Reports\nof stolen, lost, or missing licensed or registered sources of radiation. (1)\n\nTelephone reports. Each licensee or\nregistrant shall report any stolen, lost or missing licensed or registered\nsource of radiation to the commissioner by telephone immediately (as soon as\npossible but not more than four hours after discovery) after its occurrence\nbecomes known. (2)\n\nWritten reports. Each licensee or registrant required to make a report pursuant to this\nsubdivision shall, within 30 days after making the telephone report, make a\nwritten report to the commissioner setting forth the following information: (i) a description of the licensed or\nregistered source of radiation involved, including, for radioactive material, the kind, quantity, and chemical and physical form, and for radiation\nequipment, the manufacturer, model and serial number, type and maximum energy\nof radiation emitted; and\n(ii)\na\ndescription of the circumstances under which the loss or theft occurred; and\n(iii)\na statement of\ndisposition, or probable disposition, of the licensed or registered source of\nradiation involved; and\n(iv)\nexposures of individuals to radiation, circumstances under which the exposures\noccurred, and the possible total effective dose equivalent to persons in\nunrestricted areas; and\n(v) actions\nthat have been taken, or will be taken, to recover the source of radiation; and\n(vi)\nprocedures or measures\nthat have been, or will be, adopted to ensure against a recurrence of the loss\nor theft of licensed or registered sources of radiation. (3)\n\nAfter filing the written report, the\nlicensee or registrant shall also report any additional substantive information\non the loss or theft within 30 days after the discovery of such\ninformation. (4)\n\nThe names of\nindividuals who may have received exposure to radiation must be stated only in\na separate and detachable portion of the report. (b) Notification of incidents. (1)\n\nImmediate notification. Notwithstanding\nother requirements for notification, each licensee or registrant shall\nimmediately (as soon as possible but not more than four hours after discovery)\nreport each event involving a source of radiation possessed by the licensee or\nregistrant that may have caused or threatens to cause any of the following\nconditions: (i) an individual to receive: (a) a total effective dose equivalent of 0.25\n\nSv (25 rem) or more; or\n(b) an eye\ndose equivalent of 0.75 Sv (75 rem) or more; or\n(c) a shallow dose equivalent to the skin or\nextremities of 2.5 Gy (250 rad) or more; or\n(d) a dose to any organ in which the total of\nthe deep dose equivalent and the committed dose equivalent is 2.5 Sv (250 rem)\nor more; or\n(ii)\nthe\nrelease of radioactive material, inside or outside of a restricted area, so\nthat, had an individual been present for 24 hours, the individual could have\nreceived an intake five times the occupational ALI. This provision does not\napply to locations where personnel are not normally stationed during routine\noperations, such as hotcells or process enclosures; or\n(iii)\nthe inability or failure to implement\nimmediate protective actions necessary to avoid exposures to radiation or\nradioactive materials which could exceed regulatory limits, or releases of\nradioactive material which could exceed regulatory limits. (2)\n\nTwenty-four hour notification. Each\nlicensee or registrant shall, within 24 hours of discovery of the event, report\neach event involving loss of control of a licensed or registered source of\nradiation possessed by the licensee or registrant that may have caused, or\nthreatens to cause, any of the following conditions: (i) an individual to receive, in a period of\n24 hours: (a) a total effective dose\nequivalent exceeding 0.05 Sv (5 rem); or\n(b) an eye dose equivalent exceeding 0.15 Sv\n(15 rem); or\n(c) a shallow dose\nequivalent to the skin or extremities exceeding 0.5 Sv (50 rem); or\n(d) a dose to any organ in which the total of\nthe deep dose equivalent and the committed dose equivalent exceeds 0.5 Sv (50\nrem); or\n(ii)\nthe\nrelease of radioactive material, inside or outside of a restricted area, so\nthat, had an individual been present for 24 hours, the individual could have\nreceived an intake in excess of one occupational ALI. This provision does not\napply to locations where personnel are not normally stationed during routine\noperations, such as hot-cells or process enclosures; (iii)\nthe following events involving licensed\nmaterial: (a) an unplanned contamination event\nthat: (1)\nrequires access to the contaminated\narea, by workers or the public, to be restricted for more than 24 hours by\nimposing additional radiological controls or by prohibiting entry into the\narea; (2)\ninvolves a quantity of\nmaterial greater than five times the lowest annual limit on intake specified in\n\nAppendix A-13 of section\n38.41\nof this Part (rule) for the\nmaterial; and\n(3)\nhas access to the\narea restricted for a reason other than to allow isotopes with a half-life of\nless than 24 hours to decay prior to decontamination; (b) an event in which equipment is disabled\nor fails to function as designed when: (1)\nthe\nequipment is required by regulation or license condition to prevent releases\nexceeding regulatory limits, to prevent exposures to radiation and radioactive\nmaterials exceeding regulatory limits, or to mitigate the consequences of an\naccident; (2)\nthe equipment is\nrequired to be available and operable at the time it is disabled or fails to\nfunction; and\n(3)\nno redundant\nequipment is available and operable to perform the required safety\nfunction; (c) an event\nthat requires unplanned medical treatment at a medical facility of an\nindividual with spreadable radioactive contamination on the individual's\nclothing or body; (d) an unplanned\nfire or explosion damaging any licensed material or any device, container, or\nequipment containing licensed material when: (1)\nthe quantity of material involved is\ngreater than five times the lowest annual limit on intake specified in Appendix\nA-13 of section\n38.41\nof this Part (rule) for the\nmaterial; and\n(2)\nthe damage\naffects the integrity of the licensed material or its container. (3)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall prepare\neach report filed with the commissioner pursuant to this subdivision so that\nnames of individuals who have received exposure to sources of radiation are\nstated in a separate and detachable portion of the report. (4)\n\nLicensees or registrants shall make the\nreports required by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision by telephone, telegram, mailgram, or facsimile to the commissioner and shall include the\nfollowing information to the extent that it is available at the time of the\nreport: (i) the reporting person's name and\ncontact telephone number; (ii)\na\ndescription of the event, including date and time; (iii)\nthe exact location of the\nevent; (iv)\nthe radioactive\nmaterials involved, including quantities and chemical and physical form; and\n(v) any personnel radiation\nexposure data available. (5)\n\nThe provisions of this subdivision do not\napply to doses that result from planned special exposures, provided such doses\nare within the limits for planned special exposures, and are reported pursuant\nto subdivision (d) of this section. (c) Reports of exposures, radiation levels, and concentrations of radioactive material exceeding the\nlimits. (1)\n\nReportable events. In\naddition to the notification required by subdivision (b) of this section, each\nlicensee or registrant shall submit a written report within 30 days after\nlearning of any of the following occurrences: (i) incidents for which notification is\nrequired by subdivision (b) of this section; (ii)\ndoses in excess of any of the following: (a) the occupational dose limits for adults\nin section\n38.18\n(a) of this\n\nPart (rule); (b) the occupational\ndose limits for a minor in section\n38.18\n(g) of this\n\nPart (rule); (c) the limits for an\nembryo/fetus of a declared pregnant woman in section\n38.18\n(h) of this\n\nPart (rule); (d) the limits for an\nindividual member of the public in section\n38.19\n(a) of this\n\nPart (rule); (e) any applicable\nlimit in the license or registration; (f) the ALARA constraint on air emissions\nestablished under section\n38.17\n(d) of this\n\nPart; or\n(iii)\nlevels of\nradiation or concentrations of radioactive material in: (a) a restricted area in excess of applicable\nlimits in the license or registration; (b) an unrestricted area in excess of 10\ntimes the applicable limit set forth in this Part (rule) or in the license or\nregistration, whether or not involving exposure of any individual in excess of\nthe limits in section\n38.19\n(a) of this\n\nPart (rule).
