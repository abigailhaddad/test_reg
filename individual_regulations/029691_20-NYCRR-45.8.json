  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 45.8 - Interstate and foreign commerce\n\nState Regulations\n(a) As originally enacted there was no express provision in the law taxing or\nexempting receipts from sales made or services rendered in interstate or\nforeign commerce. However, by the 1951 legislative revision of highway taxes, the statute was amended to define gross income and gross operating income to\ninclude \"receipts * * * from all transportation whether originating, terminating or traversing this state, by omnibuses having a seating capacity of\nmore than seven persons, allocated on the basis of mileage within and without\nthis state, * * *\" Consequently, such allocated receipts from interstate or\nforeign transportation by omnibus are subject to tax. (b) Irrespective of whether the receipts from\nsales made or services rendered in interstate or foreign commerce are taxable, the total receipts should be included in gross income on the return and a\ndeduction taken with a proper explanation for all or any portion thereof not\nsubject to tax. Question 34:A utility in Binghamton, N. Y., furnishes\nservice to a consumer in Pennsylvania. Are the receipts from such a sale\ntaxable? Answer: No. The receipts should be included in gross income on the\nreturn, but a deduction therefor should be taken. Question 35:An omnibus operator charges $8.68 for\ntransporting a passenger from Albany, New York to Washington, D. C., or from\n\nWashington, D. C. to Albany, New York. The distance traveled on either trip is\n400 miles of which 150 miles is traveled in New York State. Is any portion of\nthe $8.68 taxable? Answer: Yes. The portion taxable is $3.26 computed as\nfollows: (150/400) x $8.68 = $3.26\n\nQuestion 36:An omnibus operator charges six dollars for\ntransporting a passenger between points A and B, both of which are located in\n\nNew York State, or six dollars for transporting a passenger between points C\nand D, both of which are located outside New York State. The total mileage\ntraveled on either trip is 300 miles of which 250 miles is traveled in New York\n\nState. Is any portion of the six dollars taxable? Answer: Yes. The portion\ntaxable is five dollars computed as follows: (250/300) x $6 = $5\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
