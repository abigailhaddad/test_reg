  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 3000.22 - Service and filing of documents\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General rule. (1)\n\nDate of filing. If any document required\nto be filed under this Part within a prescribed period or on or before a\nprescribed date under authority of any provision of article 40 of the Tax Law\nis, after such period or date, delivered by United States mail to the New York\n\nState Division of Tax Appeals or Tax Appeals Tribunal, Agency Building 1, Empire State Plaza, Albany, New York 12223, the date of the United States\npostmark stamped on the envelope or other appropriate wrapper in which such\ndocument is contained will be deemed to be the date of filing. Where delivery\nis made by courier, delivery, messenger or similar services, the date of\ndelivery will be deemed to be the date of filing. (2)\n\nMailing requirements. Any document\nrequired to be filed under this Part will not be considered to be timely mailed\nor timely filed unless the document is mailed in accordance with the following\nrequirements: (i) The document must be\ncontained in an envelope or other appropriate wrapper and properly addressed\nto: State of New York Division of Tax Appeals or Tax Appeals Tribunal, Agency\n\nBuilding 1, Empire State Plaza, Albany, New York 12223. (ii)\n\nThe envelope containing the document\nmust be deposited in the mail of the United States within the prescribed period\nor on or before the prescribed date with sufficient postage prepaid. For this\npurpose, such document is considered to be deposited in the mail of the United\n\nStates when it is deposited with the domestic mail service of the United States\n\nPostal Service. The domestic mail service of the United States Postal Service\nincludes mail transmitted within, among and between the United States, its\nterritories and possessions, and Army-Air Force (APO) and Navy (FPO) post\noffices. (iii)\n\nThe envelope or\nother wrapper containing the document must bear a date stamped by the United\n\nStates Postal Service which is within the prescribed period or on or before the\nprescribed date for filing (including any extension of time granted for filing\nsuch document). If the postmark stamped by the United States Postal Service on\nthe envelope or wrapper containing the document does not bear a date which\nfalls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for\nfiling such document in accordance with article 40 of the Tax Law, the document\nwill be considered not to be timely filed, regardless of when the envelope or\nwrapper containing such document is deposited in the mail. Accordingly, the\nsender assumes the risk that the envelope containing the document will bear a\npostmark date stamped by the United States Postal Service within the prescribed\nperiod or on or before the prescribed date for filing (including any extension\nof time granted for filing such document), but see subdivision (c) of this\nsection with respect to the use of registered mail or certified mail to avoid\nthis risk. Furthermore, if the postmark made by the United States Postal\n\nService on the envelope or wrapper containing the document is not legible, the\nperson who is required to file the document has the burden of proving when the\npostmark was made. (3)\n\nIf an envelope or wrapper containing a document and bearing sufficient United\n\nStates postage is missing a postmark which should have been affixed by the\n\nUnited States Postal Service, then whether the envelope or wrapper was mailed\nin accordance with this subdivision will be determined solely by applying the\nprovisions of subdivision (b) of this section, except for the postmarked date\nrequired by subparagraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. (b) Postmarks not made by the United States\n\nPostal Service. (1)\n\nIf the postmark on the\nenvelope or wrapper containing the document is made by other than the United\n\nStates Postal Service (i.e., office metered mail): (i) the postmark so made must bear a date\nwhich falls within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date\nfor filing the document (including any extension of time granted for filing the\ndocument); and\n(ii)\nthe document\nmust be received by the State of New York Division of Tax Appeals or the Tax\n\nAppeals Tribunal, Agency Building 1, Empire State Plaza, Albany, New York\n12223, not later than the time when an envelope or other appropriate wrapper\nwhich is properly addressed and mailed and sent by the same class of mail would\nordinarily be received if it were postmarked at the same point of origin by the\n\nUnited States Postal Service within the prescribed period or on or before the\nprescribed date for filing (including any extension of time granted for filing\nthe document). (2)\n\nIn\ncase the document is received after the time when a document so mailed and so\npostmarked by the United States Postal Service would ordinarily be received, such document will be treated as having been received at the time when a\ndocument so mailed and so postmarked would ordinarily be received, if the\nperson who is required to file the document establishes: (i) that it was actually deposited in the\nmail before the last collection of the mail from the place of deposit which was\npostmarked (except for metered mail) by the United States Postal Service within\nthe prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for filing the\ndocument; (ii)\nthat the delay in\nreceiving the document was due to a delay in the transmission of the mail; and\n(iii)\nthe cause of such\ndelay. (3)\n\nIf the\nenvelope or wrapper containing the document has a postmark made by the United\n\nStates Postal Service in addition to the postmark not so made, the postmark\nwhich was not made by the United States Postal Service will be disregarded, and\nwhether the envelope or wrapper was mailed in accordance with this subdivision\nwill be determined solely by applying the provisions of subdivision (a) of this\nsection. (c) Registered\nand certified mailing. (1)\n\nIf an envelope or\nwrapper containing a document is sent by United States registered mail, the\ndate of such registration is treated as the postmark date and the date of\nfiling. (2)\n\nIf an envelope or\nwrapper containing a document is sent by United States certified mail and the\nsender's receipt is postmarked by the postal employee to whom such envelope is\npresented, the date of the postmark on such receipt is treated as the postmark\ndate of the document and the date of filing. (d) Document defined. The term document, as\nused in this section, means any exception to Administrative Law Judge's\ndetermination, petition or other document required to be filed under the\nauthority of any provision of article 40 of the Tax Law. (e) Filing and service. (1)\n\nFiling. Filing of all pleadings, motions, exceptions and other papers with the Division of Tax Appeals or the tribunal\npursuant to this Part shall be made by either delivery during business hours to\nits Albany offices or by mail properly addressed to New York State Division of\n\nTax Appeals or Tax Appeals Tribunal, Agency Building 1, Empire State Plaza, Albany, New York 12223. (2)\n\nService. Service of all motions, exceptions and other papers on the office of\ncounsel of the Division of Taxation pursuant to this Part shall be made by\neither delivery during business hours to its Albany offices or by mail properly\naddressed to the appropriate person at the Office of Counsel, Division of\n\nTaxation, Building 9, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. (f) If the envelope or wrapper\ncontaining the document is mailed in a foreign country, the date of receipt of\nthe envelope or wrapper will be deemed to be the date of filing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
