Tit. 1 § 319.140 - Sausage\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this section, or under\narticle 5-D of the Agriculture and Markets Law with respect to products\nconsisting partly of poultry, sausage is the coarse or finely comminuted meat\nfood product prepared from one or more kinds of meat or meat and meat\nby-products, containing various amounts of water as provided for elsewhere in\nthis Part, and usually seasoned with condimental proportions of contimental\nsubstances, and frequently cured. Certain sausage as provided for elsewhere in\nthis Part may contain binders and extenders; e.g., cereal, vegetable starch, starchy vegetable flour, soy flour, soy protein concentrate, isolated soy\nprotein, nonfat dry milk, calcium reduced skim milk or dried milk. The finished\nproduct shall contain no more than three and one-half percent of these\nadditives individually or collectively.

Sausage may not contain phosphates except that uncooked pork\nfrom cuts cured with phosphates listed in paragraph 318.7(c)(4) of this Article\nmay be used in cooked sausage. To facilitate chopping or mixing to dissolve the\nusual curing ingredients, water or ice may be used in the preparation of\nsausage which is not cooked in an amount not to exceed three percent of the\ntotal ingredients in the formula. Cooked sausages such as Polish sausage, cotto\nsalami, braunschweiger, liver sausage, and similar cooked sausage products may\ncontain no more than 10 percent of added water in the finished\nproduct.
