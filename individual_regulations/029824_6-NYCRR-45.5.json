(e) The\nminimum supervision fee equals the current entry-level biweekly salary for the\njob title of laborer, plus the cost of fringe benefits and a program overhead\ncharge of 15 percent of the total of salary and fringe benefits. (f) If the reasonable costs to the department\nof supervision over the removal of shellfish from uncertified areas exceed the\nminimum fee, additional fees sufficient to reimburse the department for such\nadditional costs will be assessed as follows: (1)\nthe cost of overtime resulting from\non-site supervision; and/or\n(2)\nthe\ncosts incurred by the department through the assignment of additional on-site\nsupervisors. Such additional assessments will be based upon the number of hours\nactually worked, with a provision that the minimum fee for each additionally\nassigned supervisor will be based on four hours per day; (3)\nthe cost of fringe benefits, holiday\ntime, meal and travel expenses will be assessed and a program overhead charge\nbased upon 15 percent of their total plus 15 percent of the total of additional\nsalaries will be assessed.

Subsequent\nbiweekly payments are due on the 14th day after the commencement date of the\npermitted shellfishing activity and every 14th day thereafter. Payment of any\nadditional fee required under subdivision (f) of this section is due within 15\ndays of receipt of notice of its assessment.

(3)\n\nIf a project does not commence within a\nperiod of two weeks following the commencement date identified in the approved\npermit application, the initial application fee received by the department\nshall be forfeited and a new nonrefundable initial payment shall be required\nprior to project commencement.
