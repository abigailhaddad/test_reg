  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 155.5 - Uniform safety standards for school construction and maintenance projects\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Monitoring of\nconstruction and maintenance activities. The occupied portion of any school\nbuilding shall always comply with the minimum requirements necessary to\nmaintain a certificate of occupancy and shall be monitored during construction\nor maintenance activities for safety violations by school district personnel. It is the responsibility of the board of education or board of cooperative\neducational services to assure that these standards are continuously maintained\nwhen the building or any portion thereof is occupied. (b) Investigation and disposition of\ncomplaints relating to health and safety received as a result of construction\nand maintenance activities. Boards of education and boards of cooperative\neducational services shall follow procedures established under section\n155.4\n(d)(7)\nof\nthis Part. (c) Pre-construction\ntesting and planning for construction projects. (1)\n\nBoards of education and boards of\ncooperative educational services shall assure that proper planning is made for\nsafety of building occupants during construction. For all construction projects\nfor which bids are issued on or after September 30, 1999, such boards shall\nassure that safety is addressed in the bid specifications and contract\ndocuments before contract documents are advertised for bid. All school areas to\nbe disturbed during renovation or demolition shall be tested for lead and\nasbestos. Appropriate procedures to protect the health of building occupants\nshall be included in the final construction documents for bidding. (2)\n\nBoards of education and boards of\ncooperative educational services shall establish procedures for involvement of\nthe health and safety committee to monitor safety during school construction\nprojects. The health and safety committees in school districts other than in\ncities with one million inhabitants or more shall be expanded during\nconstruction projects to include the project architect, construction manager, and the contractors. Such committee shall meet periodically to review issues\nand address complaints related to health and safety resulting from the\nconstruction project. In the case of a city school district in a city of one\nmillion inhabitants or more, the board of education shall submit procedures for\nprotecting health and safety during construction to the commissioner for\napproval. Such procedures shall outline methods for compliance with this\nsection. (3)\n\nThe district emergency\nmanagement plan shall be updated to reflect any changes necessary to\naccommodate the construction process, including an updated emergency exit plan\nindicating temporary exits required due to construction. Provisions shall be\nmade for the emergency evacuation and relocation or release of students and\nstaff in the event of a construction incident. (4)\n\nFire drills shall be held to familiarize\nstudents and staff with temporary exits and revised emergency procedures\nwhenever such temporary exits and revised emergency procedures are\nrequired. (d) Pre-construction notification of construction projects. The board of education\nor board of cooperative educational services shall establish procedures for\nnotification of parents, staff and the community in advance of a construction\nproject of $10,000 or more to be conducted in a school building while the\nbuilding is occupied. Such procedures shall provide notice at least two months\nprior to the date on which construction is scheduled to begin, provided that in\nthe case of emergency construction projects, such notice shall be provided as\nfar in advance of the start of construction as is practicable. Such notice\nshall include information on the district's obligations under this section to\nprovide a safe school environment during construction projects. Such notice\nrequirement may be met by publication in district newsletters, direct mailings, or holding a public hearing on the project to inform parents, students, school\npersonnel and community members. (e) General safety and security standards for\nconstruction projects. (1)\n\nAll construction\nmaterials shall be stored in a safe and secure manner. (2)\n\nFences around construction supplies or\ndebris shall be maintained. (3)\n\nGates shall always be locked unless a worker is in attendance to prevent\nunauthorized entry. (4)\n\nDuring\nexterior renovation work, overhead protection shall be provided for any\nsidewalks or areas immediately beneath the work site or such areas shall be\nfenced off and provided with warning signs to prevent entry. (5)\n\nWorkers shall be required to wear photo\nidentification badges at all times for identification and security purposes\nwhile working at occupied sites. (f) Separation of construction areas from\noccupied spaces. Construction areas which are under the control of a contractor\nand therefore not occupied by district staff or students shall be separated\nfrom occupied areas. Provisions shall be made to prevent the passage of dust\nand contaminants into occupied parts of the building. Periodic inspection and\nrepairs of the containment barriers must be made to prevent exposure to dust or\ncontaminants. Gypsum board must be used in exit ways or other areas that\nrequire fire rated separation. Heavy duty plastic sheeting may be used only for\na vapor, fine dust or air infiltration barrier, and shall not be used to\nseparate occupied spaces from construction areas. (1)\nA specific stairwell and/or elevator\nshould be assigned for construction worker use during work hours. In general, workers may not use corridors, stairs or elevators designated for students or\nschool staff. (2)\n\nLarge amounts of\ndebris must be removed by using enclosed chutes or a similar sealed system. There shall be no movement of debris through halls of occupied spaces of the\nbuilding. No material shall be dropped or thrown outside the walls of the\nbuilding. (3)\n\nAll occupied parts of\nthe building affected by renovation activity shall be cleaned at the close of\neach workday. School buildings occupied during a construction project shall\nmaintain required health, safety and educational capabilities at all times that\nclasses are in session. (g) Maintaining exiting and ventilation\nduring school construction projects. The following information shall be\nincluded in all plans and specifications for school building projects: (1)\nA plan detailing how exiting required by\nthe applicable building code will be maintained during construction. The plan\nshall indicate temporary construction required to isolate construction\nequipment, materials, people, dust, fumes, odors, and noise during the\nconstruction period. Temporary construction details shall meet code-required\nfire ratings for separation and corridor enclosure. At a minimum, required\nexits, temporary stairs, ramps, exit signs, and door hardware shall be provided\nat all times. A plan detailing how adequate ventilation will be\nmaintained during construction. The plan shall indicate ductwork which must be\nrerouted, disconnected, or capped in order to prevent contaminants from the\nconstruction area from entering the occupied areas of the building. The plan\nshall also indicate how required ventilation to occupied spaces affected by\nconstruction will be maintained during the project. (h) Fire and hazard prevention. Areas of buildings under construction that are to remain occupied shall\nmaintain a certificate of occupancy. In addition, the following shall be\nstrictly enforced: (1)\n\nNo smoking is allowed\non public school property, including construction areas. (2)\n\nDuring construction daily inspections of\ndistrict occupied areas shall be conducted by school district personnel to\nassure that construction materials, equipment or debris not block fire exits or\nemergency egress windows. (3)\n\nProper operation of fire extinguishers, fire alarm, and smoke/fire detection\nsystems shall be maintained throughout the project. (i) Noise abatement during construction and\nmaintenance activities. Construction and maintenance operations shall not\nproduce noise in excess of 60 dba in occupied spaces or shall be scheduled for\ntimes when the building or affected building spaces are not occupied or\nacoustical abatement measures shall be taken. Noise level measurements (dba)\nshall be taken with a type 2 sound level meter in the occupied space in a\nlocation closest to the source of the noise. Complaints regarding excessive\nnoise shall be addressed through the health and safety committee. The district\nshould anticipate those times when construction noise is unacceptable and\nincorporate \"no work\" periods into the bid specifications. (j) Control of chemical fumes, gases, and\nother contaminants during construction and maintenance projects. The bid\nspecifications and construction contracts for each construction project shall\nindicate how and where welding, gasoline engine, roofing, paving, painting or\nother fumes will be exhausted. Care must be taken to assure fresh air intakes\ndo not draw in such fumes. (1)\n\nThe bid\nspecifications shall require schedules of work on construction and maintenance\nprojects which include time for off-gassing of volatile organic compounds\nintroduced during construction before occupancy is allowed. Specific attention\nis warranted for activities including glues, paint, furniture, carpeting, wall\ncoverings, and drapery. Manufacturers shall be contacted to obtain information\nregarding appropriate temperatures and times needed to cure or ventilate the\nproduct during use and before safe occupancy of a space can be assured. Building materials or furnishings which off-gas chemical fumes, gases, or other\ncontaminants shall be aired out in a well ventilated heated warehouse before it\nis brought to the project for installation or the manufacturer's recommended\noff-gassing periods must be scheduled between installation and use of the\nspace. If the work will generate toxic gases that cannot be contained in an\nisolated area, the work must be done when school classes and programs are not\nin session. The building must be properly ventilated and the material must be\ngiven proper time to cure or off-gas before re-occupancy. (2)\n\nManufacturer's material safety data\nsheets (MSD) shall be maintained at the site for all products used in the\nproject. MSDS must be provided to anyone who requests them. MSDS indicate\nchemicals used in the product, product toxicity, typical side effects of\nexposure to the product and safe procedures for use of the product. (k) Asbestos abatement protocols. All asbestos abatement projects shall comply with all applicable Federal and\n\nState laws including but not limited to the New York State Department of Labor\nindustrial code rule 56 (12 NYCRR\n56\n), and the Federal Asbestos Hazard\n\nEmergency Response Act (AHERA), 40 CFR part\n763\n(Code of Federal Regulations, 1998 Edition, Superintendent of Public Documents, U.S. Government Printing\n\nOffice, Washington, DC 20402; 1998; available at the Office of Facilities\n\nPlanning, Education Building Annex, Room 1060, State Education Department, Albany, NY 12234). Large and small asbestos projects as defined by 12 NYCRR\n56\nshall not be performed while the building is occupied. Minor asbestos projects\ndefined by 12 NYCRR\n56\nas an asbestos project involving the removal, disturbance, repair, encapsulation, enclosure or handling of 10 square feet or\nless of asbestos or asbestos material, or 25 linear feet or less of asbestos or\nasbestos material may be performed in unoccupied areas of an occupied building\nin accordance with the above referenced regulations. (l) Lead paint. Any construction or\nmaintenance operations which will disturb lead based paint will require\nabatement of those areas pursuant to protocols detailed in the \"Guidelines for\nthe Evaluation and Control of Lead-Based Paint Hazards in Housing\" (June 1995; U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Washington, D.C. 20410; available at the Office of Facilities Planning, Education Building Annex, Room\n1060, State Education Department, Albany, NY 12234). All areas scheduled for\nconstruction as well as areas of flaking and peeling paint shall be tested for\nthe presence of lead and abated or encapsulated in accordance with the above\nnoted guidelines. (m) Radon. Districts shall take responsibility to be aware of the geological potential for\nhigh levels of radon and to test and mitigate as appropriate. This information\nis available from the New York State Department of Health Radon Measurement\n\nDatabase. (n) Post construction\ninspection. The school district or board of cooperative educational services\nshall provide the opportunity for a walk-through inspection by the health and\nsafety committee members to confirm that the area is ready to be reopened for\nuse.
