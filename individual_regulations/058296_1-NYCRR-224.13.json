Tit. 1 § 224.13 - Custom blending devices, test procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Custom\nblending device\nshall mean any gasoline dispensing device that\ndelivers a mixture of two gasoline products of different octane\nratings. (b) Any blended fuel\ndispensed in the inspection and test of a custom blending device shall be\nreturned to the lowest octane storage tank supplying that custom blending\ndevice. (c) Custom blending devices\nwhere the blending occurs after the measurement of the products shall be\ninspected and tested for accuracy according to the procedures set forth below. (1)\n\nAllow 10-second drain period each time\ntest measure is emptied. To determine proper operation of totalizers, observe\nand record the totalizer indications before and after all test\ndrafts. (2)\n\nTest at lowest octane. Set selector control so that lowest octane product is dispensed. Normal test -\nfull flow - basic tolerance. If the first test is well within tolerance, proceed to\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision; otherwise repeat this test. (3)\n\nCheck computed price on both sides of\ndispenser. (4)\n\nTest at highest\noctane. Set selector control so that highest octane product is dispensed. Normal test - full flow - basic tolerance. If test is well within tolerance, proceed to paragraph (5) of\nthis subdivision; otherwise repeat this test. (5)\n\nCheck computed price on both sides of\ndispenser. (6)\n\nTest at blend -\nselect an intermediate blend. Special test -slow flow - basic tolerance. If test is well within tolerance and the error is less than\nor equals the average error of the previous two tests, proceed to paragraph (7)\nof this subdivision; otherwise slow flow test at first grade above lowest\noctane and first grade beneath highest octane (where\napplicable). (7)\n\nCheck\ncomputed price on both sides of dispenser. (8)\n\nSet money-value computation on other\nblends. Set selector control at each of the remaining blends and dispense one\nindicated gallon to check computed price. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.

Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. (a) Diesel motor fuel\nsold at retail shall be identified by the grades of 1-D or 2-D. The grade of\ndiesel motor fuel\nshall be continuously posted on each face of the dispenser that displays the sale information. (b) Kerosene\nsold at retail shall be identified by the grades of 1-K or 2-K. (1)\n\nWhen sold through a retail computing dispenser, the grade of\nkerosene\nshall be continuously posted on each face of the dispenser that displays the sale information. When sold through an approved manually operated stroke pump or using an approved liquid measure, the grade shall be conspicuously posted on a sign or placard. (2)\n\nIn the case of 2-K\nkerosene, an additional statement \"WARNING -NOT SUITABLE FOR USE IN UNVENTED HEATERS REQUIRING 1-K\nKEROSENE\n\" shall be presented in block letters at least one-half inch (1/2\") in height and one-sixteenth inch (\n1\n/\n16\n\") stroke (width of type) on a contrasting background. When\nkerosene\nis sold through a retail computing dispenser, the warning statement shall be continuously posted on the upper fifty percent (50 percent) of the dispenser. When\nkerosene\nis sold through an approved manually operated stroke pump or using an approved liquid measure, the warning statement shall be conspicuously posted on a sign or placard. Notes\nN.Y.
