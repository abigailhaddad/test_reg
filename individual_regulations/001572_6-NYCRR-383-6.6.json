Tit. 6 §§ 383-6.6 - Cost estimates for implementing the closure plan\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every applicant or permittee must submit\na detailed, written estimate of the cost, in current dollars, for implementing\nthe closure plan as required by section\n383-6.3\n(b)(2)(i)\nof this Subpart. The cost estimate must be approved by the department and based\non the cost of implementing the closure plan as approved or amended by the\nterms and conditions of the permit. The cost estimate must include the costs\nof: (1)\ndecontamination and dismantlement of\nland disposal facility structures; and\n(2)\nclosure of the land disposal facility so\nthat the need for ongoing active maintenance is eliminated to the extent\npracticable and only minor custodial care, surveillance, and monitoring are\nrequired; (3)\nimplementation of the\nclosure plan based on the costs of hiring a third party to implement the\nclosure plan; and\n(4)\nimplementation of the closure plan reflecting the costs of closure at the\nestimated point in the land disposal facility's operation period when the\nextent and manner of operation and inventory of wastes would make closure the\nmost expensive, as indicated by the closure plan. (b) The cost estimate must not incorporate\nany salvage value that may be realized from the sale of wastes, land disposal\nfacility structures, equipment, land or other assets associated with the land\ndisposal facility at the time of closure. (c) The cost estimate must reflect\nconsideration of the size, type, and location of the land disposal facility and\nthe nature and volume of waste to be disposed, any portion of the closure plan\nwhich has been completed, and the degree and duration of risks to human health\nand the environment. (d) The\npermittee must submit a revised cost estimate to the department no later than\n30 days after the department has approved a change in the closure plan that\naffects the cost of implementing the closure plan. The department may require\nthe permittee to submit a revised financial assurance plan, in accordance with\nsection\n383-6.3\n(f) of this\n\nSubpart, which reflects such revised cost estimate. (e) On an annual basis, until closure of the\nland disposal facility, the permittee must revise the estimated cost to account\nfor inflation. The revised cost estimate must be submitted to the department in\naccordance with the requirements of section\n383-6.3\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
