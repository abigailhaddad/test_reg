(c) Radius of Evaluation: Evaluation of the\nmaximum noise levels to be produced during operation of the facility shall be\nconducted on a cumulative (if any) and non-cumulative basis for all sensitive\nreceptors within the sound study area, defined as follows: (1)\n\nFor wind facilities, the evaluation shall\ninclude, at a minimum, all sensitive receptors in a one (1)-mile radius from\nany wind turbine or substation proposed for the facility. For the cumulative\nnoise analysis, the evaluation shall include noise from any wind turbine and\nsubstation existing and proposed by the time of filing the application and any\nexisting sensitive receptor within a two (2)-mile radius from any wind turbine\nor substation proposed for the facility. (2)\n\nFor solar facilities, the evaluation\nshall include, at a minimum, all sensitive receptors within a one thousand five\nhundred (1,500) foot radius from any noise source (e.g., substation\ntransformer(s), medium to low voltage transformers, inverters, energy storage)\nproposed for the facility or within the thirty (30) dBA noise contour, whichever is greater.

(d) Modeling\nstandards, input parameters, and assumptions: (1)\n\nFor both wind and solar facilities, the\nevaluation shall use computer noise modeling software that follows the ANSI/ASA\nS12.62-2012/ISO 9613-2:1996 (MOD) (see section 1100-15.1(a)(1)(v) of this Part)\nor the ISO-9613-2:1996 propagation standards (see section 1100-15.1(g)(1)(i) of\nthis Part) with no meteorological correction (Cmet) added. The model shall: (i) Set all noise sources operating\nsimultaneously at maximum sound power levels; (ii)\n\nUse a ground absorption factor of no\nmore than G=0.5 for lands and G=0 for water bodies; (iii)\n\nUse a temperature of ten (10) degrees\n\nCelsius and seventy (70) percent relative humidity; (iv)\n\nReport, at a minimum, the maximum\nA-weighted dBA Leq (1-hour or 8-hour) sound pressure levels in a year, and the\nmaximum linear/unweighted/Z dB (Leq 1-hour) sound pressure levels in a year\nfrom the thirty-one and a half (31.5) Hz up to the eight thousand (8,000) Hz\nfull-octave band, at all sensitive sound receptors within the radius of\nevaluation; (v) Report the maximum\nA-weighted dBA Leq sound pressure levels in a year (Leq (8-hour)) at the most\ncritically impacted external property boundary lines of the facility site\n(e.g., non-participating boundary lines); (vi)\n\nReport the information in tabular and\nspreadsheet compatible format as specified herein and in subdivisions (f)(3)\nand (q)(2) of this section. A summary of the number of receptors exposed to\nsound levels greater than thirty-five (35) dBA will also be reported in tabular\nformat grouped in one (1)-dB bins; and\n(vii)\n\nReport noise impacts with sound level\ncontours (specified in subdivision (k) of this section) on the map described in\nsubdivision (h) of this section. (2)\n\nFor wind facilities, the model shall: (i) Be performed at a minimum for the turbine\nmodel with the highest broadband A-weighted apparent sound power level at any\nwind speed condition; (ii)\n\nUse a\none and a half (1.5) meter assessment point above the ground and the addition\nof a minimum uncertainty factor of two (2) dBA, or a four (4) meter assessment\npoint above the ground and the addition of an uncertainty factor of zero (0)\ndBA or greater. (3)\n\nFor\nsolar facilities, the model shall use a one and a half (1.5) meter assessment\npoint above the ground and the addition of an uncertainty factor of zero (0)\ndBA or greater. (e) Evaluation of prominent tones for the design: (1)\n\nFor wind and solar facility noise\nsources: The evaluation shall be conducted by using manufacturer sound\ninformation, the ANSI/ASA S12.62-2012/ISO 9613-2:1996 (MOD) (see section\n1100-15.1(a)(1)(v) of this Part) or the ISO 9613-2:1996 propagation standard\n(see section 1100-15.1(g)(1)(i) of this Part) attenuations (Adiv, Aatm, Agr, and Abar), and the \"prominent discrete tone\" constant level differences (Kt)\nspecified in ANSI/ASA S12.9-2013/Part 3 Annex B, Section B.1 (see section\n1100-15.1(a)(1)(ii) of this Part), as follows: fifteen (15) dB in low-frequency\none-third-octave bands (from twenty-five (25) up to one hundred twenty-five\n(125) Hz); eight (8) dB in middle-frequency one-third-octave bands (from one\nhundred sixty (160) up to four hundred (400) Hz); and five (5) dB in\nhigh-frequency one-third-octave bands (from five hundred (500) up to ten\nthousand (10,000) Hz). (2)\n\nFor\nsubstation transformers and other solar facility noise sources (such as\ninverters/medium to low voltage transformers) where no manufacturer's\ninformation or pre-construction field tests are available, the sounds will be\nassumed to be tonal and prominent. (f) Evaluation of low frequency noise for\nwind facilities: If other wind turbines considered for the facility have lower\n(or equal) broadband A-weighted sound power levels than the turbine modeled in\nthe application, but greater maximum un-weighted sound power levels at the\nthirty-one and a half (31.5) Hz, or sixty-three (63) Hz full-octave bands, the\nestimate of low frequency noise levels at the thirty-one and a half (31.5) Hz, or sixty-three (63) Hz bands can be based on: (1)\n\nComputer noise modeling that uses the\nmaximum sound power levels at the thirty-one and a half (31.5) and sixty-three\n(63) Hz frequency bands at any wind speed among all turbines considered for\neach turbine location. (2)\n\nAlternatively, if the noise modeling uses only one (1) wind turbine model\nacross the site and if noise reduction operations are not used in the design, the noise levels at the thirty-one and a half (31.5) and sixty-three (63)Hz\nfull octave bands can be estimated by applying corrections to the low-frequency\nband sound pressure results from the computer noise modeling for the turbine\nwith the maximum overall broadband sound power level. These corrections will be\nequivalent to the differences between the maximum sound power levels at the\nthirty-one and a half (31.5) and sixty-three (63) Hz bands at any wind speed\nfor all turbines considered for the facility and the sound power levels for the\nturbine used for computer noise modeling at the thirty-one and a half (31.5)\nand sixty-three (63) Hz full-octave bands respectively. (3)\n\nThe maximum linear/unweighted/Z Leq\n(1-hour) sound pressure levels (dB) in a year at the sixteen (16), thirty-one\nand a half (31.5) and sixty-three (63) Hz full octave bands for all receptors\nwithin the radius of evaluation shall be reported in tabular and spreadsheet\ncompatible format. A list of all sound sensitive receptors with sound pressure\nlevels (SPLs) equal to or greater than sixty-five (65) dB at sixteen (16), thirty-one and a half (31.5) or sixty-three (63) Hz, shall be provided along\nwith their SPLs. The number of receptors exceeding sixty (60) dB at sixteen\n(16), thirty-one and a half (31.5) or sixty-three (63) Hz shall also be\nreported, grouped in one (1)-dB bins. (g) Evaluation of infrasound for wind\nfacilities: Infrasound levels at the sixteen (16) Hz full-octave band can be\nbased on computer noise modeling software with such capabilities or, by using\nextrapolated SPL data down to sixteen (16) Hz. The extrapolation estimates can\nbe based on corrections applied to the sound pressure results at thirty-one and\na half (31.5) Hz to obtain the sound pressure results at sixteen (16) Hz at\neach receptor as follows: (1)\n\nIf no\ninformation from the manufacturer is available for the sixteen (16) Hz\nfull-octave frequency band for any turbine models considered for the facility, at a minimum four (4) dB shall be added to the SPLs at thirty-one and a half\n(31.5) Hz, to obtain SPLs at sixteen (16) Hz. (2)\n\nIf computer noise modeling uses only one\n(1) wind turbine model across the site, noise reduction operations are not used\nin the design, and the sound power levels at sixteen (16) Hz are available for\nall turbine models considered for the facility, the correction shall be\nequivalent to the difference between the highest manufacturer's sound power\nlevel at sixteen (16) Hz at any wind speed and the sound power level at\nthirty-one and a half (31.5) Hz used for computer noise modeling, and it shall\nbe applied to the sound pressure results at thirty-one and a half (31.5) Hz to\nobtain the sound pressure results at sixteen (16) Hz. (3)\n\nIf computer noise modeling uses only one\n(1) wind turbine model across the site, noise reduction operations are not used\nin the design, and the sound power level information at sixteen (16) Hz is\navailable for some but not all turbines considered for the facility, at a\nminimum four (4) dB, or the difference between the maximum sound power level at\nsixteen (16) Hz at any wind speed known for any turbines considered for the\nfacility and the sound power level for the thirty-one and a half (31.5) Hz\nfull-octave frequency band used for computer modeling, whichever is greater, shall be applied to the sound pressure results at thirty-one and a half (31.5)\n\nHz to obtain the sound pressure results at sixteen (16) Hz. (4)\n\nThe procedures indicated above, do not\nrestrict the applicant from using additional corrections that provide more\nconservative (i.e., higher) SPLs at the receptors than as obtained as indicated\nabove. (h) A map of the\nstudy area showing the location of sensitive sound receptors in relation to the\nfacility (including any related substations), as follows. (1)\n\nThe sensitive sound receptors shown shall\ninclude all residences, outdoor public facilities and public areas, hospitals, schools, libraries, parks, camps, summer camps, places of worship, cemeteries, any historic resources listed or eligible for listing on the State or National\n\nRegister of Historic Places, any public (federal, state and local) lands, cabins and hunting camps identified by property tax codes, and any other\nseasonal residences with septic systems/running water within the Sound Study\n\nArea. (2)\n\nAll residences shall be\nincluded as sensitive sound receptors regardless of participation in the\nfacility (e.g., participating, potentially participating, and non-participating\nresidences) or occupancy (e.g., year-round, seasonal use). (3)\n\nOnly properties that have a signed\ncontract with the applicant prior to the date of filing the application shall\nbe identified as \"participating.\" Other properties may be designated either as\n\"non-participating\" or \"potentially participating.\" Updates with ID-tax numbers\nmay be filed after the application is filed.

Sound surveys\nshall be conducted for, at a minimum, a seven (7) day-long period for wind\nfacilities and a four (4) day-long period for solar facilities. (j) An evaluation of future noise levels\nduring construction of the facility including predicted A-weighted/dBA sound\nlevels using computer noise modeling as follows: (1)\n\nThe model shall use the ANSI/ASA\nS12.62-2012/ISO 9613-2:1996 (MOD) (see section 1100-15.1(a)(1)(v) of this Part)\nor the ISO-9613-2:1996 propagation standard (see section 1100-15.1(g)(1)(i) of\nthis Part) for the main phases of construction, and from activities at any\nproposed batch plant area/laydown area; (2)\n\nThe model shall include, at a minimum, all noise sources and construction sites that may operate simultaneously to\nmeet the proposed construction schedule for the most critical timeframes of\neach phase; (3)\n\nFor wind and solar\nfacilities, the operational modeling requirements included in subdivisions\n(d)(1)(i) through (d)(1)(iii), and (d)(3) of this section shall be used for\nmodeling of construction noise; and\n(4)\n\nSound impacts shall be reported with\nsound level contours (specified in subdivision (k) of this section) on the map\ndescribed in subdivision (h) of this section and sound levels at the most\ncritically impacted receptors in tabular format (as specified in subdivision\n(q)(2) of this section).
