  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 152.16 - New York State personal income tax returns on form IT-200\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where ordinary tax is not computed on the\n\nNew York State personal income tax return. Where a taxpayer files a New York\n\nState personal income tax return on form IT-200, such taxpayer may (in\naccordance with specific instructions) elect not to compute the ordinary tax on\nsuch return. In such case, the Tax Commission will determine the amount of\nordinary tax due, send the taxpayer a notice stating the amount payable, and\nmake demand for the amount payable. The amount of ordinary tax determined to be\ndue by the Tax Commission must be paid within 10 days of the date of issuance\nof the notice. However, if the notice is mailed to the taxpayer more than 10\ndays before the due date of such return, the ordinary tax must be paid on or\nbefore the due date of such return. (b) Where the ordinary tax is computed on the\n\nNew York State personal income tax return. Where a taxpayer files a New York\n\nState personal income tax return on form IT-200 and computes the amount of\nordinary tax on such return, any ordinary tax shown to be due thereon must, without assessment, notice or demand, be paid not later than the date fixed for\nfiling such return. (c) Use of tax\ntable for computing the ordinary tax. The Tax Commission has established a tax\ntable for the purpose of computing the ordinary tax by reference to stated\nincome brackets, allowable exemptions and applicable ordinary tax rates. If a\ntaxpayer files his New York State income tax return on form IT-200 and computes\nthe amount of ordinary tax on such return, he must use this table in computing\nthe ordinary tax. Notes\nN.Y.
