The reimbursement methodology described in this subpart for prevocational services (site-based) and respite (hourly and free-standing) will be phased-in over a two year period, with a year for purposes of the transition period meaning a twelve month period from July first to the following June thirtieth, and with full implementation in the beginning of the third year. During this transition period, the base operating rate will transition to the target rate according to the phase-in schedule immediately below. The base operating rate will remain fixed and the target rate, as determined by the reimbursement methodology in this subpart, will be updated to reflect rebasing of cost data, trend factors and other appropriate adjustments.
