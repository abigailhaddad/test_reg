  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 387.16 - Special provisions for household circumstances\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Self-employment\nincome. Income received from boarders by a household that does not own or\noperate a commercial boarding house shall be budgeted in accordance with\nsubdivision (b) of this section. All other households receiving self-employment\nincome, including those households that own and operate a commercial boarding\nhouse, shall have employment income calculated as follows: (1)\n\nAnnualizing self-employment income. (i) Self-employment income which represents a\nhousehold's annual income shall be annualized over a 12-month period even if\nthe income is received within only a short period of time during that 12\nmonths. (ii)\n\nSelf-employment income\nwhich is received on a monthly basis but which represents a household's annual\nsupport will normally be averaged over a 12- month period. If, however, the\naveraged amount does not accurately reflect the household's actual monthly\ncircumstances because the household has experienced a substantial increase or\ndecrease in business, self-employment income will be calculated based on\nanticipated earnings. Self- employment income must not be calculated on the\nbasis of prior income (e.g., income tax returns) when the household has\nexperienced an increase or decrease in business as determined by the local\ndepartment. (iii)\n\nSelf-employment\nincome which is intended to meet the household's needs for only part of the\nyear shall be averaged over the period of time the income is intended to\ncover. (iv)\n\nWhen a household's\nself-employment enterprise has been in existence for less than a year, the\nincome from that self-employment enterprise shall be averaged over the period\nof time the business has been in operation. The monthly amount shall then be\nprojected for the coming year. However, if the business has been in operation\nfor such a short time that there is insufficient information to make a\nreasonable projection, the household shall be certified for less than a year. Such certification process shall continue until the business has been in\noperation long enough to permit a longer projection. (v) Notwithstanding the provisions of\nsubparagraphs (i) through (iv) of this paragraph, households subject to monthly\nreporting/retrospective budgeting which derive self-employment income from a\nfarming operation and which incur irregular expenses to produce such income\nmust have the option to annualize the allowable costs of producing\nself-employment income from farming when the self-employment farm income is\nannualized. (vi)\n\nWhen the cost of\nproducing self-employment income exceeds the income derived from\nself-employment as a farmer, such losses must be offset against any other\ncountable income in the household. To be considered a self-employed farmer, the\nfarmer must receive or anticipate receiving annual gross proceeds of $1,000 or\nmore from the farming enterprise. (2)\n\nDetermining monthly income from\nself-employment. Monthly income from self-employment shall be determined as\nfollows: (i) For the period of time during\nwhich self-employment income is determined, add all gross self-employment\nincome (including capital gains), exclude the cost of producing the\nself-employment income, and divide the self-employment income by the number of\nmonths over which the income will be averaged. (ii)\n(ii)\n(a) For those households whose\nself-employment income is not averaged as described above, but is instead\ncalculated on an anticipated basis, add any capital gains the household\nanticipates it will receive in the next 12 months, starting with the date the\napplication is filed, and divide this amount by 12. (b) This amount shall be used in successive\ncertification periods during the next 12 months, except that a new average\nmonthly amount shall be calculated over this 12-month period if the anticipated\namount of capital gains changes. Add the anticipated monthly amount of capital\ngains to the anticipated monthly self-employment income, and subtract the cost\nof producing the self-employment income. The cost of producing the self-\nemployment income shall be calculated by anticipating the monthly allowable\ncosts of producing the self-employment income. (iii)\n\nThe monthly net self-employment income\nwill be added to any other earned income received by the household. The total\nmonthly earned income, less the 20- percent earned income deduction as\nspecified in section\n387.12\n(b) of this\n\nPart, will then be added to all monthly unearned income received by the\nhousehold. The standard deduction, dependent care, and shelter costs will be\ncomputed as for any other household and subtracted to determine the monthly net\nincome of the household. (3)\n\nCapital gains. The proceeds from the sale\nof capital goods or equipment shall be calculated in the same manner as a\ncapital gain for Federal income tax purposes. Even though only 50 percent of\nthe proceeds from the sale of capital goods or equipment is taxed for Federal\nincome tax purposes, the local department shall count the full amount of the\ngain as income for food stamp purposes. (4)\n\nAllowable costs of producing\nself-employment income. (i) Allowable costs of\nproducing self-employment income include, but are not limited to, the\nidentifiable costs of labor, stock, raw material, seed, fertilizer, interest\npaid to purchase income-producing property, insurance premiums, and taxes paid\non income-producing property. (ii)\n\nIn determining net self-employment income, the following items shall not be\nallowable as costs of doing business: (a) payments on the principal of the purchase price of income-producing real\nestate, capital assets, equipment, machinery, and other durable\ngoods; (b) net losses from previous\nperiods; (c) Federal, State and\nlocal income taxes, money set aside for retirement purposes, and other\nwork-related personal expenses (such as transportation to and from work), as\nthese expenses are reflected in the 20-percent earned income deduction\nspecified in section\n387.12\n(b) of this\n\nPart; and\n(d) depreciation. (b) Boarders. (1)\n\nHouseholds with boarders. Persons paying\na reasonable amount for room and board shall be excluded from the household\nwhen determining the household's eligibility and food stamp benefit level. Unless the household with whom the boarder lives requests that the boarder be\npart of their household as specified in section\n387.14\nof this Part, the\nhousehold's eligibility is determined as follows: (i) Income from the boarder. The income from\nboarders shall include all direct payments to the household for room and meals, including contributions to the household's shelter expenses. Shelter expenses\npaid directly by boarders to someone outside of the household, such as to the\nlandlord or the utility company, shall not be counted as income to the\nhousehold. (ii)\n\nCost of doing\nbusiness. After calculating the income received from boarders, the local\ndepartment must exclude that portion of the boarder payment which is a business\ncost. Furthermore, such costs cannot exceed the payments received from the\nboarder. The cost of doing business must equal one of the following: (a) the cost according to thrifty food plan\nfor a household size that is equal to the number of boarders; or\n(b) the actual documented cost of providing\nroom and meals, if the actual cost exceeds the appropriate thrifty food plan. If actual costs are used, only separate and identifiable costs of providing\nroom and meals to boarders shall be excluded. (2)\n\nDeductible expenses. The net income from\nself-employment will be added to other earned income and the 20-percent earned\nincome deduction specified in section\n387.12\n(b) of this\n\nPart will be applied to the total. Shelter costs actually incurred by the\nhousehold, even if the boarder contributes to the household for part of the\nhousehold's shelter expenses, will be considered in determining if the\nhousehold will receive a shelter deduction. However, such shelter costs can not\ninclude any shelter expenses paid directly by the boarder to a third party, such as to the landlord or utility company. (3)\nA reasonable amount for meals shall be\ncalculated according to either of the following meal plans: (i) boarders whose board arrangement is for\nthree meals or more per day shall pay an amount which equals or exceeds the\nthrifty food plan for the appropriate size of the boarder household; or\n(ii)\nboarders whose board\narrangement is for two meals or less per day shall pay an amount which equals\nor exceeds two thirds of the thrifty food plan for the appropriate size of the\nboarder household. When the boarder's payments for room are distinguishable\nfrom the payments for meals, only the amount paid for meals will be evaluated\nin determining if reasonable compensation is being paid for meals. The\nreasonable monthly amount for meals shall be paid in cash. In no event shall\nfood stamps be paid for meals and be credited toward the monthly\npayment. (c) Treatment of income and resources of\ndisqualified members. During the period of time that disqualified individuals\nare ineligible, the food stamp eligibility and benefit levels of any remaining\nhousehold members must be determined as follows: (1)\n\nDisqualified for an intentional program\nviolation or for failure to comply with a food stamp work registration\nrequirement or a food stamp work requirement as provided in section\n385.3\nof this Title. (i) Income, resources and deductible\nexpenses. The income and resources of the disqualified individuals continue to\nbe counted in the determination of the household's food stamp eligibility and\nbenefit levels. However, the entire household's allowable earned income, utility standard, medical expenses, dependent care and excess shelter\ndeductions continue to apply to the remaining household members. (ii)\n\nEligibility and benefit levels. Disqualified members are not to be included when determining the household's\nsize for the purposes of: (a) assigning a\nbenefit level to the household; (b) comparing the household's monthly income with the income eligibility standards; or\n(c) comparing the household's\nresources with the resource eligibility standards. The household's coupon\nallotment must not increase as a result of the disqualification of one or more\nhousehold members. (2)\n\nDisqualified because of ineligible alien\nstatus, failure to attest to citizenship or alien status or for refusal to\napply for or provide a social security number. (i) Resources. The resources of persons\ndisqualified because of ineligible alien status, failure to attest to\ncitizenship or alien status or for refusal to apply for or provide a social\nsecurity number continue to be counted as household resources in the\ndetermination of the household's food stamp eligibility. (ii)\n\nIncome. A pro rata share of the income\nof such disqualified members is counted as income to the household. This pro\nrata share is calculated by first subtracting the allowable exclusions from the\ndisqualified members' income and dividing the income equally among the\nhousehold members, including the disqualified members. All but the disqualified\nmembers' shares are counted as income for the remaining household\nmembers. (iii)\n\nDeductible expenses. The 20-percent earned income deduction specified in section\n387.12\n(b) of this\n\nPart will apply to the prorated income earned by such disqualified members. That portion of the household's allowable shelter and dependent care expenses\nwhich are either paid by or billed to the disqualified members will be divided\nevenly among the household's members including the disqualified members. All\nbut the disqualified members' shares are counted as deductible shelter expenses\nfor the household. (iv)\n\nEligibility\nand benefit levels. Such disqualified members must not be included when\ndetermining their households' sizes for the purposes of: (a) assigning benefit levels to the\nhouseholds; (b) comparing the\nhouseholds' monthly income with the income eligibility standards; or\n(c) comparing the households' resources with\nthe resource eligibility standards. (3)\n\nReduction or termination of benefits\nwithin the certification period. Whenever an individual is disqualified during\nthe household's certification period, the remaining household members are\ndetermined to be eligible or ineligible based, to the extent possible, on\ninformation in the case file. When an individual is disqualified, the following\nrules apply: (i) Disqualified for intentional\nprogram violation. If a household's benefits are reduced or terminated within\nthe certification period because one of its members was disqualified because of\nan intentional program violation, the social services district must notify the\nremaining members of their eligibility and benefit level at the same time the\ndisqualified member is notified of the disqualification. The household is not\nentitled to a notice of adverse action but may request a fair hearing to\ncontest the reduction or termination of benefits, unless the household has\nalready had a fair hearing on the amount of the claim as a result of\nconsolidation of the administrative disqualification hearing with the fair\nhearing. (ii)\n\nDisqualified for\nother causes. If a household's benefits are reduced or terminated within the\ncertification period because one or more of its members is an ineligible alien, was disqualified for refusal to apply for or provide a social security number, or was disqualified for failure to comply with a food stamp work registration\nrequirement or a food stamp work requirement as provided in section\n385.3\nof this Title, the social\nservices district must issue a notice of adverse action, DSS-3260, which\ninforms the household of the disqualification, the reason for the\ndisqualification, the eligibility and benefit level of the remaining members, the actions the household must take to end the disqualification and the\nhousehold's right to a fair hearing. (d) Treatment of income and resources of\nother non-household members. (1)\n\nThe income\nand resources of non-household members who have not been disqualified for an\nintentional program violation, ineligible alien status, failure to attest to\ncitizenship or alien status, failure to comply with a food stamp work\nregistration or work requirement as provided in section\n385.3\nof this Title or failure to\napply for or provide a social security number must not be considered available\nto the household. Cash payments from non-household members to the household\nwill be considered income under the income standards set forth in section\n387.10\nof this Part. Vendor\npayments are excluded as income. If the household shares deductible expenses\nwith the non-household members, only the amount actually paid or contributed by\nthe household can be deducted as a household expense. If the payments or\ncontributions cannot be differentiated, the expenses must be prorated equally\namong persons actually paying or contributing to the expense and only the\nhousehold's pro rata share can be deducted. (2)\n\nWhen the earned income of one or more\nhousehold members and the earned income of a non-household member is combined\ninto one wage, the income of the household members shall be determined as\nfollows: (i) If the household's share can be\nidentified, that portion attributable to the household as earned income shall\nbe counted as earned income. (ii)\n\nIf the household's share cannot be identified, prorate the earned income among\nall those whom it was intended to cover. Such prorated portion to the household\nshall be counted as earned income. (e) Residents of food stamp (FS) eligible\ndrug or alcoholic treatment centers. The FS certification of residents of FS\neligible drug or alcoholic treatment centers, as defined in section\n387.1\nof this Part, must be made\nthrough an authorized representative.
