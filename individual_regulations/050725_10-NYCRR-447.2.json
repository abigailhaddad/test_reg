  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 447.2 - Radiology services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (a) ACCOUNT NUMBER     COST CENTER TITLE\n7320                Radiology--Diagnostic\n7360                Radiology--Therapeutic\n7380                Nuclear Medicine\n(b) The above\ncost centers use as the basis for the Standard Unit of Measure the Radiology\n\nRelative Values as determined by the California Medical Association, 1974\n\nCalifornia Relative Value Studies (RVS). Relative Value Units for unlisted BR\n(By Report), and RNE (Relativity Not Established) procedures are to be\nreasonably estimated on the basis of other comparable procedures or estimated\nby qualified personnel. Use the \"Total Unit Value\", not the \"PC Unit Value\", in\nrecording the relative value unit counts. Because the California Medical\n\nAssociation is no longer publishing their Relative Value Studies booklet, the\n\nRadiology/Nuclear Medicine chapter is set forth as subdivisions (c)-(g) of this\nsection with the approval of CMA. (c) RADIOLOGY AND NUCLEAR MEDICINE GROUND\nRULES\n(1)\nGENERAL: Listed values for\nradiology procedures apply only when these services are performed by or under\nthe supervision of a physician. (i) The total\nunit value includes the professional component (see PC unit value below) plus\nthe technical component. The value for injection procedure is not included\nexcept when procedure is marked with a small star (). (See ground rule 6, below). This value is applicable in any situation in which a single charge is\nmade to include both professional services and the technical cost of providing\nthat service. Identification of a procedure by its 5-digit code without\nmodifier -26 or -27 indicates that the charge includes both the \"professional\"\nand \"technical\" components. (ii)\n\nThe PC unit value (professional component unit value) represents the value of\nthe professional radiological services of the physician. This includes\nexamination of the patient, when indicated, performance and/or supevision of\nthe procedure, interpretation and written report of the examination and\nconsultation with the referring physician. The value for injection procedure is\nnot included except when procedure is marked with a small star (). (See ground\nrule 6, below). This component is applicable in any situation in which the\nphysician submits a charge for these professional services only. It does not\ninclude the cost of personnel, materials, space, equipment or other facilities. To identify a charge for professional component, use the 5-digit procedure code\nfollowed by modifier -26. (See modifier -26 and Appendix 1[FN[DOUBLE DAGGER]]\nfor use of modifiers.)\n(iii)\n\nWhen\nthis section of the RVS is used in connection with a \"conversion factor\" to\nestablish fees, it must be emphasized that the SAME conversion factor cannot be\napplied to both the TOTAL UNIT VALUE and the PROFESSIONAL COMPONENT UNIT VALUE. Physicians who determine their fees by application of conversion factors to the\nunit values in this section must determine a separate factor for TOTAL UNIT\nVALUE and for PC UNIT VALUE. (iv)\n\nThe technical component includes the charges for personnel, materials, including usual contrast media and drugs, film or xerograph, space, equipment\nand other facility but excludes the cost of radioisotopes. No unit values are\nlisted for the technical component of radiology procedures, since these are\ninstitutional charges not billed separately by physicians. To identify a charge\nfor the technical component, use the 5-digit procedure code followed by\nmodifier -27. (See modifier -27 and Appendix 1 [FN[DOUBLE DAGGER]] for use of\nmodifiers.)\n(2)\nUNUSUAL\nSERVICE OR PROCEDURE: A service may necessitate skills and time of the\nphysician over and above listed services and values. If substantiated \"by\nreport,\" additional values may be warranted. (See unit value modifier -22 and\nrule 4, below.)\n(3)\nUNLISTED\nSERVICE OR PROCEDURE: When an unlisted service or procedure is provided, the\nvalues used should be substantiated \"by report.\" (See rule 4 below.) Identify\nby unlisted procedure number in appropriate section. For a comprehensive\nlisting, see pages 15-16. (4)\nPROCEDURES LISTED WITHOUT SPECIFIC UNIT VALUES: (i) BY REPORT \"BR\" ITEMS: BR in the value\ncolumn indicates that the value of this service is to be determined \"by\nreport,\" because the service is too unusual or variable to be assigned a unit\nvalue. Pertinent information concerning the nature, extent and need for the\nprocedure or service, the time, the skill and equipment necessary, etc., is to\nfurnished. A detailed clinical record is not necessary. (ii)\nRELATIVITY NOT ESTABLISHED \"RNE\" ITEMS: RNE in the value column indicates new or infrequently performed services for\nwhich sufficient data have not been collected to allow establishment of a\nrelative value. A report may be necessary. (5)\nMATERIALS SUPPLIED BY PHYSICIAN: Identify\nas 99070. (Radionuclides are identified as 99069.) Supplies and materials\nprovided by the physician (e.g., sterile trays, drugs, etc.) over and above\nthose usually included with the office visit or other services rendered may be\ncharged for separately. (List drugs, trays, materials or supplies\nprovided.)\n(6)\nINJECTION\nPROCEDURES: Values for injection procedures include all usual pre- and\npost-injection care specifically related to the injection procedure, necessary\nlocal anesthesia, placement of needle or catheter, and injection of contrast\nmedia. Vascular injection procedures are listed in the\ncardiovascular section, under procedure codes 36000-36299. Other injection\nprocedures are listed in appropriate sections. The injection procedure is\nincluded in the unit value for radiographic procedures marked with a small star\n(). (7)\nMISCELLANEOUS: (i) A physician may elect to reduce the\nlisted value of a service for a variety of reasons. To identify such charges, see modifier -52. (ii)\n\nExamination\noutside of regular hours, at bedside or in operating room, may warrant an\nadditional charge for technologist's time (see 99065, 99066). (iii)\n\nValues for office, home and hospital\nvisits, consultation and other medical services, anesthesia, surgical and\nlaboratory procedures are listed in the sections entitled \"Medicine,\"\n\"Anesthesia,\" \"Surgery\" and \"Pathology.\"\n(8)\nSPECIAL SERVICES AND BILLING PROCEDURES: (i) The following services are generally not\npart of the basic services as listed in the RVS, but do involve additional\nexpense to the physician for materials, for his time or that of his employees. Those services that are generally provided as an adjunct to common medical\nservices should be charged for only when circumstances clearly warrant an\nadditional charge over and above the usual charges for the basic services. Unit\n\nValue\n(ii)    99065  Examination outside of regular hours may warrant an      1.3(R)\nadditional charge for technologist's time............ (iii)   99066  Examination at bedside or in operating room, unless      1.3(R)\notherwise indicated, may warrant an additional charge\nfor technologist's time............ (iv)    99069  Radiopharmaceutical or other radionuclide material         BR[DAGGER]\ncost. Listed values in this section do not include\nthese costs. List the name of radiopharmiceutical, dosage and cost............ (v) 99070  Supplies and material provided by the physician (e.g., BR[DAGGER]\nsterile trays, drugs, etc.), over and above those\nusually included with the office visit or other\nservices rendered may be charged for separately. List\ndrugs, trays, supplies or materials\nprovided............ (vi)    99080  Special Reports (e.g.. insurance forms, narrative          BR[DAGGER]\nreports, review of medical records): When information\nmore than that necessary to establish or to clarify a\npatient's status is requested (e.g., more than the\nstandard reporting form) or a request is made for\nreview of medical records and report, a charge\nadequate to cover the value of the additional service\nis justifiable............ (9)\nUNIT VALUE MODIFIERS. (i) Listed values for\nmost procedures may be modified under certain circumstances as listed below. When applicable, the modifying circumstances should be identified by the\naddition of the appropriate \"modifier code number\" (including the hyphen) after\nthe usual procedure number. The values should be listed as a single modified\ntotal for the procedure. When multiple modifiers are applicable to a single\nprocedure, see modifier -99. Unit\n\nValue\n(ii)    -22  Unusual services: When the services provided are greater\nthan those usually required for the listed procedure, identify by adding this modifier (-22) to the usual\nprocedure number. List modified value. May require\nreport. (iii)   -26  Professional component: Under certain circumstances the\nphysician may wish to submit a charge for the\nprofessional component of a procedure and not for the\ntechnical component. (See definition of professional\ncomponent under ground rule 1.) Under these\ncircumstances the professional component charge is\nidentified by adding this modifier (-26) to the usual\nprocedure number and valued according to the \"PC unit\nvalue\" for that procedure. (iv)    -27  Technical component: Under certain circumstances, a\ncharge may be made for the technical component alone\n(see definition of technical component under Ground\n\nRule 1). Under those circumstances the technical\ncomponent charge is identified by adding this modifier\n(-27) to the usual procedure number. (v) -52  Reduced values: Under certain circumstances, the listed\nvalue is reduced or eliminated because of ground rules, common practice. or at the physician's election (e.g., a physician may elect to reduce the listed values in a\npatient with multiple injuries requiring extensive\nradiographic examination). Under these or similar\ncircumstances, the services provided can be identified\nby their usual procedure numbers and the use of a\nreduced value indicated by adding this modifier (-52)\nto the procedure number. (Use of this modifier provides\na means of reporting services at reduced charge without\ndisturbing usual relative values.)\n(vi)    -90  Reference (outside) laboratory: When laboratory\nprocedures are performed by other than the billing\nphysician, the procedure (s) shall be identified by\nadding this modifier (-90) to the usual single or panel\nprocedure number and shall be billed as charged to the\nphysician. (For collection and handling charges, see\n99007et seq.)\n(vii)   -99  Multiple modifiers: Under certain circumstances, multiple    BR[DAGGER]\nmodifiers may be applicable (e.g., a physician may\nperform services greater than those usually required\n[modifier -22]) and bill the professional component\n[modifier -26]). Under these circumstances, identify by\nadding this modifier (-99) to the usual procedure\nnumber and briefly indicate the circumstances. Value in\naccordance with appropriate modifiers. (d) DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY. (1)\n\nDefinitions. (i) Limited examination: An examination which\nusually includes AP and lateral views but is less than the \"complete\nexamination\" defined below. This may be due to limitation of routine views by\nthe physician; limitation for a specific purpose (e.g., AP and lateral views on\npost-reduction fracture of ankle); or necessary limitation due to the condition\nof the patient (e.g., single views for fractures in critically injured\npatient). (ii)\n\nComplete\nexamination: An examination which includes all of the necessary views for\noptimal examination of the part for the suspected condition. All listed values\nare for complete examinations unless otherwise indicated. Necessary additional\nmethods of examination (e.g., fluoroscopy, tomography, cineradiography) may be\ncharged for separately.

BR[DAGGER]\n(f) RADIATION THERAPY AND ONCOLOGY. (1)\n\nRadiation therapy as listed in this\nsection includes teletherapy (i.e., the use of X-ray and other high-energy\nmodalities, radium, cobalt, etc.) and brachytherapy (i.e., the surface, intracavitary or interstitial application of contained radioactive sources). For treatment by injectable or ingestible radioactive isotopes, see section on\n\nNuclear Medicine. (2)\n\nThe listed\ntreatment values include initial treatment planning, initial and serial beam\nverification and central axis based calculations. They include normal follow-up\ncare during the course of radiation therapy and for three months following its\ncompletion. Preliminary consultation and/or initial evaluation of the patient\nprior to radiation therapy are not included in the listed values. (See\n\nMedicine, 90000-90630). Complications or other circumstances requiring\nadditional or unusual services concurrent with therapy or during the follow-up\nperiod may warrant additional charges. (3)\n\nDefinitions. For the purpose of this\nsection, the following definitions apply: (i) Treatment Week: Four or more treatment days in a calendar week. If three\ntreatments or less in a week are given, use \"treatment day\" charge. (ii)\n\nSimple Treatment: Treatment of benign or\nmalignant diseases requiring simple field localization or simple beam shaping\ndevices, single field treatment, or surface or intracavitary therapy applied\nwithout general anesthesia. (iii)\n\nComplex Treatment: Treatment of malignant disease requiring complex field\nlocalization or use of beam shaping devices (e.g., treatment of eyelid; mantle\nfields in Hodgkin's disease, etc.) or two or more fields per region or two or\nmore regions per day, massive single dose treatment, intracavitary therapy\napplied with general anesthesia. (iv)\n\nAdjunctive Radiotherapy Physics\n\nServices: The adjunctive radiotherapy physics services listed are those\nnecessary to the conduct of radiation therapy for optimal patient care, performed in consultation with a qualified radiological physicist (e.g., patient dosimetry, design and construction of beam shaping devices). The values\nfor these services apply when these services are performed by a physician or by\na qualified radiological physicist under the supervision of a physician. (4) Teletherapy.
