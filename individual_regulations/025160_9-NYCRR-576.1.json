  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 576.1 - General rules\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where there\nare practical difficulties in carrying out the strict letter of the provisions\nof the plan or the shoreline restrictions, the agency may, after public\nhearing, vary or modify their application so that their spirit is observed, public safety and welfare secured and substantial justice done. (b) A variance will be granted when the\nadverse consequences to the applicant resulting from denial are greater than\nthe public purpose sought to be served by the restriction. (c) In determining whether a variance shall\nbe granted, the agency will consider, among other relevant factors: (1)\nwhether the application requests the\nminimum relief necessary; (2)\nwhether granting the variance will create a substantial detriment to adjoining\nor nearby landowners; (3)\nwhether\nthe difficulty can be obviated by a feasible method other than a\nvariance; (4)\nthe manner in which\nthe difficulty arose; (5)\nwhether\ngranting the variance will adversely affect the natural, scenic, and open space\nresources of the park and any adjoining water body, due to erosion, surface\nrunoff, subsurface sewage effluent, change in aesthetic character, or any other\nimpacts which would not otherwise occur; and\n(6)\nwhether the imposition of conditions upon\nthe granting of the variance will ameliorate the adverse effects referred to in\nparagraph (5) of this subdivision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n576.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
