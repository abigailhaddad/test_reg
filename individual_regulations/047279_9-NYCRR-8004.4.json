  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8004.4 - Notice of Violation, Violation of Release Report\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A notice of\nviolation shall be in writing and may consist of one or more documents and\ntheir attachments. Except as otherwise specified, the notice of violation\nincludes a report of the violations of the conditions of release. (b) The notice shall inform a releasee who is\nan alleged violator of the conditions of their release, of the purpose of the\npreliminary revocation hearing or if a preliminary hearing is not required, the\npurpose of the final revocation hearing, and shall state what conditions of\nrelease are alleged to have been violated and in what manner. The notice may\ninform the releasee of the purpose of a final hearing in any event. The\nreleasee shall also be provided written notice of the time and place of the\npreliminary hearing or of the final hearing if no preliminary hearing is\nrequired, which information may be included in the notice of violation or\nanother document provided not less than twenty-four hours in advance of such\nhearing. (c) The notice shall state\nthat at a preliminary and a final hearing the releasee: (1)\nhas the right to appear and speak in\ntheir own behalf; (2)\nhas the right\nto introduce letters and documents; (3)\nmay present witnesses who can give\nrelevant information to the presiding officer; (4)\nhas the right to confront and\ncross-examine the witnesses against them, unless the releasee has been\nconvicted of a new crime while on supervision or unless the presiding officer\nfinds good cause for their nonattendance; (5)\nhas the right to representation by\ncounsel; and\n(6)\nhas, at a final\nrevocation hearing only, the right to present mitigating evidence relevant to\nthe restoration to supervision. (d) A releasee who is the subject of a notice\nof violation shall also be provided, in writing, the name and contact details\nfor institutional defenders or assigned private counsel, as applicable. This\ninformation may be included in the notice of violation or another document. Where such information was not previously provided and a recognizance hearing\nis held, it shall be given at such time. Nothing shall require duplicate or\nrevised notification of this information. (e) Following approval of prosecution of\nviolation charges and except where a parole warrant is issued, the notice of\nviolation, or the Board or Department by other means, shall direct the releasee\nto appear in response to the notice at a specified date and time, and location\nor manner, which may be the preliminary hearing, or final hearing if a\npreliminary hearing is not required, or earlier. (1)\n\nThe direction that the releasee appear in\ninitial response to the notice may be a condition of release and/or instruction\nfrom the parole officer. Notwithstanding section\n8004.7\nof this Part, the\ndiscretionary inclusion of any charge alleging a violation of the direction\nshall not provide basis for the issuance of a parole warrant for retaking and\ntemporary detention in any case that, without such charge, would not have been\neligible for the issuance of a warrant or eligible for the issuance of a\nwarrant if the releasee failed to appear within forty-eight hours of the time\ndesignated for response, nor shall such inclusion otherwise result in the\nreleasee being subject to reincarceration as set forth in the Executive Law\nshould that violation be sustained at a final hearing within such case. No\ncharge alleging a violation of this direction may be sustained where service of\nthe notice of violation was pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section unless\nthe relevant charge(s) alleging the releasee to have absconded from supervision\nare not sustained. (2)\n\nThe notice\nof violation, or the Board or Department by other means, may also direct, as a\ncondition of release, that the releasee appear at all or any preliminary and\nfinal revocation proceedings and any adjourned or continuation appearances\ntherefrom. Where such proceedings follow or are scheduled for after the date\nfor initial response to the notice of violation and the releasee has appeared\nin response to such notice, any violation of such direction may be included as\na charge in the matter and may provide basis, in whole or in part and in\naccordance with section\n8004.7\nof this Part, for the\nissuance of a parole warrant for retaking and temporary detention of the\nreleasee, or for the retaking of the releasee into custody under a warrant\nalready issued. (3)\n\nDirection to\nappear in response to a notice of violation shall not occur until such notice\nor the charges of violation are produced, provided, however, that such\ndirection may occur prior to the production of the notice where the Department\nreasonably believes that its formal completion will be imminent absent\nmitigating circumstances. (f) The notice of violation shall be properly\nand promptly served upon the releasee following its completion and approval for\nprosecution. A notice may be approved for prosecution within the meaning of\nthis subdivision upon approval for prosecution of the violation charges, and\nwith or without the date, time and place of the preliminary and final hearings\nbeing specified at such time. Proper and prompt service of the notice of\nviolation occurs when the releasee is served with the notice within a\nreasonable amount of time under the totality of the circumstances at the\ndiscretion of the Board or Department, or at the time of a recognizance hearing\npursuant to the Executive Law. The notice shall be served in reasonable advance\nof the date of a preliminary hearing, and not less than twenty-four hours prior\nto such hearing. (g) Where the\n\nDepartment believes the releasee has absconded from supervision and that the\nreleasee remains in such status, service of the notice of violation may be\nproperly and promptly effectuated by delivering such notice to the releasee's\napproved address, or last known address if different than the approved address, and this delivery shall be reflected in Department records. If the releasee is\nthereafter understood to have returned to or be retained in custody within and\nunder the jurisdiction of New York State and is accessible to the Department, service in accordance with subdivision (f) of this section will then be\nattempted but such efforts shall not be construed as meaning that appropriate\nservice had not already occurred. (h) A releasee in federal custody, or who is\nout of state whether or not in custody and whether or not such custody, if any, may be pursuant to the uniform act for out-of-state parolee supervision, shall\nnot be considered within the convenience and practical control of the\n\nDepartment so as to require prompt service of a notice of violation. The\n\nDepartment may effectuate service in accordance with subdivision (f) of this\nsection following the releasee's known return to the convenience and practical\ncontrol of the Department. Nothing within this subdivision shall preclude the\n\nDepartment from sending a notice of violation or its attachments, to\nauthorities in another jurisdiction or to a releasee who is not within its\nconvenience and practical control, nor shall sending any such material imply\nthat further proceedings are required prior to the individual's known return to\nthe Department's convenience and practical control. Furthermore, for any such\nreleasee, nothing within this subdivision precludes the Department, in its\ndiscretion, from commencing the revocation process or otherwise directing a\nreleasee's return to New York State for further action relative to alleged\nviolations of the conditions of release. (i) On or after service of a notice of\nviolation, as far as practicable or feasible, any additional documents having\nbeen collected or prepared that are relevant to the violation charges shall be\ndelivered to the releasee. (j) The Department may amend, add or otherwise\nsupplement violation charges at any time within a case, and must provide notice\nof the added or amended charges to the releasee in reasonable advance of any\npreliminary or final hearing where such charges will be prosecuted, unless such\nnotice is waived or the lack of such notice is not prejudicial.
