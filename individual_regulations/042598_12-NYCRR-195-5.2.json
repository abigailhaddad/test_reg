  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 195-5.2 - Deductions for advances\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection 193, subdivision 1(d), of the New York State\n\nLabor Law permits an employer to make deductions from an employee's wages for\nrepayment of advances of salary or wages made by the employer to the employee. An advance is the provision of money by the employer to the employee based on\nthe anticipation of the earning of future wages. Any provision of money which\nis accompanied by interest, fee(s) or a repayment amount consisting of anything\nother than the strict amount provided, is not an advance, and may not be\nreclaimed through the deduction of wages. Deductions made in repayment of an\nadvance are only permitted as follows: (a) Timing and duration. The employer and\nemployee must agree to the timing and duration of the repayment deduction in\nwriting before the advance is given. Once an advance is given, no further\nadvance may be given or deducted until any existing advance has been repaid in\nfull. Any money given by the employer to the employee in excess of the amounts\nand durations permitted to be deducted pursuant this Part shall not be\nrecoverable through wage deductions. (b) Frequency. The employer shall recover\nadvances by wage deduction no more than each wage payment, provided that such\ndeduction complies with this Part. (c) Method of recovery. Advances may be\nrecovered through wage deduction or by separate transaction, as long as the\nprocedures of subdivisions (a) and (d) through (i) of this section are\nfollowed. For purposes of this section, payments referenced as wage deductions\nshall include separate transactions. (d) Limitations on the periodic amount of\nrecovery. The amount recovered through deduction per wage payment shall be\ndetermined by the written terms of the advance authorization, and may include\ntotal reclamation through deduction of the last wage payment should employment\nend prior to the expiration of the other terms of the written advance\nauthorization. (e) Authorization. Prior to the advance being given to the employee the employee shall give\nwritten authorization for the deduction(s) to be made to repay the advance. Such authorization shall contain the amount to be advanced, the amount to be\ndeducted to repay the advance in total and per wage payment and the date(s)\nwhen each such deduction shall be taken. This authorization may only be revoked\nprior to the actual provision of the advance by the employer. The authorization\nshall also include notice to the employee that he or she may contest any\ndeduction that is not in accordance with the terms of the written advance\nauthorization. (f) The employer\nshall implement a procedure by which the employee, after receiving the advance, may dispute the amount and frequency of deductions that are not in accordance\nwith the terms of the written advance authorization. An employee receiving such\nan advance shall be given written notice of this procedure. Dispute resolution\nprovisions in collective bargaining agreements existing at the time of issuance\nof these regulations which provide at least as much protection to the employee\nshall be deemed to be in compliance with this section. Dispute resolution\nprovisions in collective bargaining agreements executed after the issuance of\nthese regulations which provide at least as much protection to the employee and\nwhich specifically reference this section shall also be deemed to be in\ncompliance with this section. (1)\n\nThe\nemployee shall be able to provide written notice of the employee's objection to\nthe deduction. (2)\n\nThe employer\nshall reply in writing to the employee's objection as soon as practical. Such\nreply shall address the issues raised by the employee's objection, and contain\na clear statement indicating the employer's position with regard to the\ndeduction, including whether the employer agrees with the employee's\nposition(s) regarding the deduction or disagrees with the employee's\nposition(s) and provide a reason why the employer agrees or\ndisagrees. (g) Should an\nemployee avail themselves to the procedure set forth in subdivision (f) of this\nsection, the employer shall cease deductions until such reply has been given\nand any appropriate adjustments made. Any delay in repayment caused by this\nprocedure shall extend the authorized time frame within which the employer may\nrecover the advance though deductions. (h) The failure of an employer to afford this\nprocess to the employee will create the presumption that the contested\ndeduction was impermissible. (i) Any provision of money by the employer to the employee that does not comply\nwith section\n193\nof the Labor Law\nand this Part shall not be considered an \"advance\" and may not be reclaimed\nthrough wage deductions. (j) Nothing in this section shall be construed as abridging the rights of the\nemployer or employee to seek redress in any other forum, including with the\n\nDepartment of Labor. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
