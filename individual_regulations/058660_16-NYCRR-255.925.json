  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.925 - External corrosion direct assessment (ecda)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definition. ECDA is a four-step process\nthat combines preassessment, indirect inspection, direct examination, and post\nassessment to evaluate the threat of external corrosion to the integrity of a\npipeline. (b) General requirements. An operator that uses direct assessment to assess the threat of external\ncorrosion must follow the requirements in this section, in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (as\ndescribed in section\n10.3\nof this Title), section 6.4, and in NACE RP 0502 (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title). An operator\nmust develop and implement a direct assessment plan that has procedures\naddressing preassessment, indirect examination, direct examination, and\npost-assessment. If the ECDA detects pipeline coating damage, the operator must\nalso integrate the data from the ECDA with other information from the data\nintegration (section\n255.917\n[b]\nof\nthis Part) to evaluate the covered segment for the threat of third party\ndamage, and to address the threat as required by section\n255.917\n(e)(l)\nof\nthis Part. (1)\n\nPreassessment. In addition to\nthe requirements in ASME/ANSI B31.8S section 6.4 and NACE RP 0502, section 3, the plan's procedures for preassessment must include: (i) provisions for applying more restrictive\ncriteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a covered segment; and\n(ii)\nthe basis on which an\noperator selects at least two different, but complementary indirect assessment\ntools to assess each ECDA Region. If an operator utilizes an indirect\ninspection method that is not discussed in Appendix A of NACE RP 0502, the\noperator must demonstrate the applicability, validation basis, equipment used, application procedure, and utilization of data for the inspection\nmethod. (2)\n\nIndirect\nexamination. In addition to the requirements in ASME/ANSI B31.8S section 6.4\nand NACE RP 0502, section 4, the plan's procedures for indirect examination of\nthe ECDA regions must include: (i) provisions\nfor applying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time\non a covered segment; (ii)\ncriteria\nfor identifying and documenting those indications that must be considered for\nexcavation and direct examination. Minimum identification criteria include the\nknown sensitivities of assessment tools, the procedures for using each tool, and the approach to be used for decreasing the physical spacing of indirect\nassessment tool readings when the presence of a defect is suspected; (iii)\ncriteria for defining the urgency of\nexcavation and direct examination of each indication identified during the\nindirect examination. These criteria must specify how an operator will define\nthe urgency of excavating the indication as immediate, scheduled or monitored; and\n(iv)\ncriteria for scheduling\nexcavation of indications for each urgency level. (3)\n\nDirect examination. In addition to the\nrequirements in ASME/ANSI B31.8S section 6.4 and NACE RP 0502, section 5, the\nplan's procedures for direct examination of indications from the indirect\nexamination must include: (i) provisions for\napplying more restrictive criteria when conducting ECDA for the first time on a\ncovered segment; (ii)\ncriteria for\ndeciding what action should be taken if either: (a) corrosion defects are discovered that\nexceed allowable limits (section\n5.5.2.2 of NACE RP 0502); or\n(b) root cause analysis reveals\nconditions for which ECDA is not suitable (section\n5.6.2 of NACE RP 0502); (iii)\ncriteria and notification\nprocedures for any changes in the ECDA Plan, including changes that affect the\nseverity classification, the priority of direct examination, and the time frame\nfor direct examination of indications; and\n(iv)\ncriteria that describe how and on what\nbasis an operator will reclassify and reprioritize any of the provisions that\nare specified in section\n5.9\n\nOf NACE RP 0502. (4)\n\nPost assessment and continuing\nevaluation. In addition to the requirements in ASME/ANSI B31.8S section 6.4 and\nNACE RP 0502, section 6, the plan's procedures for post assessment of the\neffectiveness of the ECDA process must include: (i) measures for evaluating the long term\neffectiveness of ECDA in addressing external corrosion in covered segments; and\n(ii)\ncriteria for evaluating\nwhether conditions discovered by direct examination of indications in each ECDA\nregion indicate a need for reassessment of the covered segment at an interval\nless than that specified in section\n255.939\nof this Part. (See\n\nAppendix D of NACE RP 0502.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.925\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
