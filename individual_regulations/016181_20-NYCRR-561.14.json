They are in addition to the general penalty provisions of the Tax\n\nLaw, applicable to failure to comply with any of the provisions of articles 28\nand 29 of the Tax Law, which may also apply to violations of the Tax Law\ninvolving automotive fuel. (b) Possession of untaxed motor fuel by a filling station owner. Any owner of a filling station who willfully and knowingly\nhas in its custody, possession or under its control any motor fuel upon which\nthe prepaid tax described in section\n561.3\nof\nthis Part has not been assumed or paid by a distributor registered as such\nunder article 12-A of the Tax Law, or has not been passed through to the owner\nof the filling station as required by the Tax Law, shall be liable for a\npenalty in the amount of twice the tax not assumed or paid or passed through. Such penalty may be determined by the Department of Taxation and Finance within\nthree years of the date when such motor fuel came into the custody or\npossession, or under the control, of the owner of the filling station. Such\npenalty may be assessed and collected by the Department of Taxation and Finance\nin the same manner as any taxes imposed by articles 28 and 29 of the Tax Law. The Department of Taxation and Finance may, of its own motion, abate any part\nof such penalty determined to be excessive or erroneous. (1)\nA filling station owner shall willfully\nand knowingly have in its custody, possession or under its control motor fuel\nupon which the prepaid tax has not been assumed or paid by a registered\ndistributor or has not been passed through to the filling station owner as\nrequired by the Tax Law when such owner is aware of the requirement that taxes\nbe prepaid on such motor fuel and knows that no such prepaid taxes have been\npassed through to it. (2)\n\nIt shall\nbe presumptive evidence that such owner shall willfully and knowingly have in\nits custody, possession or under its control motor fuel upon which the prepaid\ntax has not been assumed or paid by a registered distributor or has not been\npassed through to such owner as required by the Tax Law where the filling\nstation owner has not received the certification of tax payment described in\nsection\n561.5\nof this Part at the time of delivery of such motor fuel or at such later time\nas provided by section\n561.6\nof this Part. (c) Failure to report or pay prepaid tax. Any person who fails to file a return for prepaid tax or\nremit prepaid tax to the Department of Taxation and Finance within the time\nrequired by section\n561.3\nof\nthis Part shall be liable for a penalty in the amount of the prepaid tax\nrequired to be paid. If the department determines that such failure to timely\nfile or pay the prepaid tax was due to reasonable cause rather than willful\nneglect, it shall remit all or part of such penalty. (d) Any officer, director, shareholder or\nemployee of a corporation or of a dissolved corporation, any employee of a\npartnership or any employee of an individual proprietor ship, who as such\nofficer, director, shareholder or employee is under a duty to act for such\ncorporation, partnership or proprietorship in complying with any requirement of\narticle 28 of the Tax Law, and any member of a partnership, which fails to pay\nthe tax required to be prepaid by section\n1102\nof the Tax Law shall be liable for a\npenalty equal to the total amount of the tax not paid, plus penalties and\ninterest computed pursuant to Part 536 of this Title as if such person were a\ndistributor. If the Department of Taxation and Finance determines that such\nfailure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, it shall\nremit all or part of such penalty imposed under this subdivision. Such penalty\nshall be determined, assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as the tax\nrequired to be prepaid by section\n1102\nof the Tax Law; provided, however, that the penalty provided for by this subdivision will not be imposed on any\nperson on account of the failure of a distributor to pay the tax required to be\nprepaid by section\n1102\nof the Tax Law in the circumstance\nwhere such person is otherwise liable for such tax as a person required to\ncollect tax within the meaning of this Title and liability in such capacity has\nbeen imposed.
