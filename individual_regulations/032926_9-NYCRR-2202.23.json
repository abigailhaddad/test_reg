  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2202.23 - Order where apartment is rented to more than one tenant\n\nState Regulations\n(a) On and after February 1, 1952, where an\napartment, in whole or in part, is rented or sought to be rented to more than\none tenant, the landlord shall file an application with the administrator to\nfix maximum rents for the units or portions of such apartment. Such application\nshall set forth the present maximum rent for the apartment, the furniture, furnishings, facilities, equipment and other services added or proposed to be\nadded, the number of occupants and the space to be occupied by each tenant in\nsuch apartment, the terms and conditions of occupancy, and all other data which\nmay be required by the administrator. In fixing the maximum rent, the\nadministrator shall apportion the previous maximum rent for the entire\napartment among the tenants in proportion to the space they occupy, and shall\nadd thereto the increased rental value of any furniture, furnishings, facilities and equipment added by the landlord. Where the landlord has\nsatisfied all of the requirements of the authorities having jurisdiction over\nthe physical conversion and over the occupancy of the changed housing\naccommodations, the administrator, in fixing maximum rents for individual\ntenants, shall also take into consideration all factors bearing on the equities\ninvolved, including the cost of any physical conversion or alteration. If there\nwas no previous maximum rent for the entire apartment, the administrator, prior\nto making the apportionment and fixing a maximum rent for each tenant as\nhereinabove required, shall establish a maximum rent for the entire apartment, having regard for the maximum rents for comparable housing accommodations, or\nany factors bearing on the equities involved, consistent with the purposes of\nthe Rent Law. Unless and until an order is issued by the administrator fixing\nmaximum rents for the individual tenants of the apartment, the aggregate\nmaximum rent for all of the tenants in the apartment shall be the maximum rent\npreviously established for the apartment. All orders issued under this section\nshall be effective as of the date of first renting. (b) Where no application has been made under\nthis section, the administrator at any time, upon written request of a tenant\nor on his own initiative, may issue an order pursuant to this section fixing or\nestablishing a maximum rent for each of the individual tenants in the\napartment, effective as of the date of such renting. In fixing such maximum\nrents for the individual tenants, the administrator shall use the standards\nprescribed in subdivision (a) of this section. Such order may contain a\ndirective that all rent collected in excess of the maximum rent established\nunder this subdivision, during the period beginning no earlier than two years\nprior to the date of the filing of the tenant's statement of violations, if\nany, or the date of the commencement of the proceeding to fix or establish the\nmaximum rent, whichever date is earlier, shall be refunded to the tenant, together with six percent interest from the date of each such excessive payment\nof rent, within 30 days after such order shall become final.
