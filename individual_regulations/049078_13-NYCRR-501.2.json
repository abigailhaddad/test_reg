  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 13 § 501.2 - Legal standard\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Grant or\ndenial of preclearance. The CRB shall grant preclearance to a covered\npolicy only if the CRB is able to determine that the covered policy will not\ndiminish the ability of members of a protected class to participate in the\npolitical process or to elect their preferred candidates to office. Absent such\na determination, preclearance will be denied and the covered policy shall not\nbe enacted or implemented. (b) Basis for the CRB determination. The CRB shall base a preclearance\ndetermination on a review of material presented by the covered entity, relevant\ninformation provided by interested individuals and groups or otherwise obtained\nby the CRB, and the results of any independent analysis conducted by the\nCRB. (c) Standard of\nreview. A covered policy will be precleared only if it will not diminish\nthe ability of members of any protected class to participate in the political\nprocess and to elect their preferred candidates to office. (1)\nA covered policy will not diminish the\nability of members of a protected class to participate in the political process\nand to elect their preferred candidates to office if it will not lead to a\nretrogression in the position of members of a protected class (i.e., it will\nnot make members of such a group worse off than they had been before the\nchange) with respect to their ability to participate in the political process\nand to elect their preferred candidates to office. (2)\nA change will be deemed retrogressive as\nto a protected class's ability to participate in the political process where: (i) the individuals who will be burdened by\nthe change are disproportionately likely to be members of one or more protected\nclasses; and\n(ii)\nthe change\nimposes a burden material enough that it will likely cause some members of such\nprotected classes not to vote or otherwise participate in the political\nprocess. (3)\n\nRetrogression is assessed with respect to all impacted protected\nclasses. (d) Benchmark\n(1)\n\nIn determining\nwhether a covered policy submission is retrogressive, the CRB will compare the\nsubmitted change to the voting qualification, prerequisite to voting, law, ordinance, standard, practice procedure, regulation or policy (hereafter\n\"policy\") in force or effect at the time of the submission. (2)\n\nIf the existing policy at the time of the\nsubmission was not in force or effect on the covered entity's applicable date\nfor coverage, it cannot serve as a benchmark, and the comparison shall be with\nthe policy most recently in force or effect. (3)\n\nIn determining the appropriate benchmark, the CRB will evaluate the proposed change in light of all relevant conditions\nexisting at the time of the submission, including whether an electoral contest\nother than the most recent one held provides a more appropriate benchmark. In\nmaking this determination, the CRB may consider, among other factors, the\noffices on the ballot and whether the proposed change involves a primary, general, or special election. (4)\n\nThe implementation and use of a covered policy that has not been precleared\ndoes not operate to make that practice a benchmark for any subsequent covered\npolicy submitted by the covered entity. (e) Burden of proof\n(1)\n\nAlthough information dispositive of\nwhether preclearance should be granted or denied may be provided by third-party\nindividuals or entities or obtained by the CRB's own independent analysis, the\nburden of demonstrating that preclearance should be granted rests at all times\nwith the covered entity submitting the proposed change. (2)\n\nThe covered entity must provide: (i) sufficient information by which the CRB\ncan determine the benchmark against which to compare the proposed covered\npolicy; and\n(ii)\ninformation\nsufficient to demonstrate that, as compared with that benchmark, the ability of\nany protected class present in the political subdivision to participate in the\npolitical process and to elect their preferred candidates to office will not be\ndiminished as a result of enactment or implementation of the proposed\nchange.
