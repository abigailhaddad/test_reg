  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.2 - General facility standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nThe\nregulations in this section apply to owners and operators of all hazardous\nwaste facilities, except as section\n373-3.1\nprovides\notherwise. (b) Identification number. Every facility owner or operator must apply to EPA for an\nEPA identification number in accordance with the EPA notification procedures\n(45 FR\n12746, et seq. ) (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). (c) Required\nnotices. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of\na facility that has arranged to receive hazardous waste from a source outside\nof the United States must notify the department in writing at least four weeks\nin advance of the date on which the first shipment of the hazardous waste is\nexpected to arrive at the facility. The owner or operator of a facility that\nhas arranged to receive hazardous waste from an OECD country, as defined in\nsection\n372.5\n(h)(1)\nof\nthis Title must also notify the EPA regional administer in writing at least\nfour weeks in advance of the date on which the first shipment of the hazardous\nwaste is expected to arrive at the facility. Notice of subsequent shipments of\nthe same waste from the same foreign source is not required. Note: For purposes of reference only: The owner or operator of\na recovery facility that has arranged to receive hazardous waste from an OECD\nMember country, as defined in section\n372.5\n(h)(1)\nof\nthis Title must also meet the requirement of\n40 CFR\n265.12(a)(2)\n(see section\n370.1[e] of this Title). (2)\n\nBefore transferring ownership or operation of a facility during its operating\nlife, or of a disposal facility during the post-closure care period, the owner\nor operator must notify the new owner or operator, in writing, of the\nrequirements of this Subpart and Subpart 373-1 of this Part. Note: An owner's or operator's failure to notify the new owner\nor operator of the requirements of this Subpart in no way relieves the new\nowner or operator of this obligation to comply with all applicable\nrequirements. (d) General waste analysis. (1)\n(i) Before an owner or operator treats, stores or disposes of any hazardous waste, or nonhazardous waste if applicable\nunder section\n373-3.7\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart, the owner or operator must obtain a detailed chemical and\nphysical analysis of a representative sample of the wastes. At a minimum, this\nanalysis must contain all the information which must be known to treat, store\nor dispose of the waste in accordance with the requirements of this Subpart and\n\nPart 376 of this Title. (ii)\n\nThe\nanalysis may include data developed under Part 371 of this Title and existing\npublished or documented data on the hazardous waste or on hazardous waste\ngenerated from similar processes. Note: For example, the facility's records of analyses performed\non the waste before the effective date of these regulations, or studies\nconducted on hazardous waste generated from processes similar to that which\ngenerated the waste to be managed at the facility, may be included in the data\nbase required to comply with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. The owner or\noperator of an offsite facility may arrange for the generator of the hazardous\nwaste to supply part or all of the information required by subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph, except as otherwise specified in section\n376.1\n(g)(2) and\n(3)\nof this Title. If the generator does not\nsupply the information, and the owner or operator chooses to accept a hazardous\nwaste, the owner or operator is responsible for obtaining the information\nrequired to comply with this subdivision. (iii)\n\nThe analysis must be repeated as\nnecessary to ensure that it is accurate and up-to-date. At a minimum, the\nanalysis must be repeated: (a) when the owner\nor operator is notified, or has reason to believe, that the process or\noperation generating the hazardous waste or nonhazardous waste, if applicable, under section\n373-3.7\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart has changed; and\n(b) for offsite facilities, when the results of the inspection required in\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph indicate that the hazardous waste received\nat the facility does not match the waste designated on the accompanying\nmanifest or shipping paper. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator of an offsite\nfacility must inspect and, if necessary, analyze each hazardous waste movement\nreceived at the facility to determine whether it matches the identity of the\nwaste specified on the accompanying manifest or shipping paper. (2)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must develop and follow a written waste analysis plan which describes\nthe procedures which will be carried out to comply with paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. This plan must be kept at the facility. At a minimum, the plan\nmust specify: (i) the parameters for which\neach hazardous waste, or nonhazardous waste, if applicable, under section\n373-3.7\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart will be analyzed and the rationale for the selection of these\nparameters (\ni.e., how analysis for these parameters will\nprovide sufficient information on the waste's properties to comply with\nparagraph [1] of this subdivision); (ii)\nthe test methods which will be used to\ntest for these parameters; (iii)\nthe sampling method which will be used to obtain a representative sample of the\nwaste to be analyzed. A representative sample may be obtained using either: (a) one of the sampling methods described in\n\nAppendix 19 of this Title; or\n(b) an equivalent sampling method; Note: See section\n371.3\n(a) of this\n\nTitle for related discussion. (iv)\nthe frequency with which the initial\nanalysis of the waste will be reviewed or repeated to ensure that the analysis\nis accurate and up-to-date; (v) for\noffsite facilities, the waste analyses that hazardous waste generators have\nagreed to supply; (vi)\nwhere\napplicable, the methods which will be used to meet the additional waste\nanalysis requirements for specific waste management methods as specified in\nsections\n373-3.10\n(k), 373-3.11\n(d), 373-3.12\n(c), 373-3.13\n(c), 373-3.14\n(g), 373-3.15\n(b), 373-3.16\n(c), 373-3.17\n(c), 373-3.27\n(e)(4), 373-3.28\n(n)(4), 373-3.29\n(e) and\n376.1\n(g) of this\n\nTitle; and\n(vii)\nfor surface\nimpoundments exempted from land disposal restrictions under 376.1(d)(1) of this\n\nTitle, the procedures and schedule for: (a) the sampling of impoundment contents; (b) the analysis of test data; and\n(c) the annual removal of residues which are\nnot delisted under\n40\nCFR\n260.22\nand\n370.3(c)\nof this Title and do exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste or which do\nnot meet the treatment standards of section\n376.4\nof this Title; (viii)\nfor owners and operators\nseeking an exemption to the air emission standards of section\n373-3.29\nof this Subpart in\naccordance with section\n373-3.29\n(d) of\nthis Subpart: (a) if direct measurement is\nused for the waste determination, the procedures and schedules for waste\nsampling and analysis, and the results of the analysis of test data to verify\nthe exemption; and\n(b) if knowledge\nof the waste is used for the waste determination, any information prepared by\nthe facility owner or operator or by the generator of the hazardous waste, if\nthe waste is received from off-site, that is used as the basis for knowledge of\nthe waste. (3)\n\nFor offsite facilities, the waste\nanalysis plan required in paragraph (2) of this subdivision must also specify\nthe procedures which will be used to inspect and, if necessary, analyze each\nmovement of hazardous waste received at the facility to ensure that it matches\nthe identity of the waste designated on the accompanying manifest or shipping\npaper. At a minimum, the plan must describe: (i) the procedures which will be used to\ndetermine the identity of each movement of waste managed at the\nfacility; (ii)\nthe sampling method\nwhich will be used to obtain a representative sample of the waste to be\nidentified, if the identification method includes sampling; and\n(iii)\nthe procedures that the owner or\noperator of an off-site landfill receiving containerized hazardous waste will\nuse to determine whether a hazardous waste generator or treater has added a\nbiodegradable sorbent to the waste in the container. (e) Security. (1)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must prevent the unknowing entry, and minimize the possibility for the\nunauthorized entry, of persons or livestock onto the active portion of a\nfacility, unless: (i) physical contact with\nthe waste, structures or equipment within the active portion of the facility\nwill not injure unknowing or unauthorized persons or livestock which may enter\nthe active portion of a facility; and\n(ii)\ndisturbance of the waste or equipment, by the unknowing or unauthorized entry of persons or livestock onto the active\nportion of a facility, will not cause a violation of the requirements of this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n\nUnless the\nowner or operator has made a successful demonstration under subparagraphs\n(1)(i) and (ii) of this subdivision, a facility must have: (i) a 24-hour surveillance system\n(\ne.g., television monitoring or surveillance by guards or\nfacility personnel) which continuously monitors and controls entry onto the\nactive portion of the facility; or\n(ii)\n(a) an\nartificial or natural barrier (\ne.g., a fence in good repair or\na fence combined with a cliff), which completely surrounds the active portion\nof the facility; and\n(b) a means to\ncontrol entry, at all times, through the gates or other entrances to the active\nportion of the facility (\ne.g., an attendant, television\nmonitors, locked entrance, or controlled roadway access to the facility). Note: The requirements of paragraph (2) of this subdivision are\nsatisfied if the facility or plant within which the active portion is located\nitself has a surveillance system, or a barrier and a means to control entry, which complies with the requirements of subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this\nparagraph. (3)\n\nUnless exempt under subparagraphs (1)(i)\nand (ii) of this subdivision, a sign with the legend, \"Danger-Unauthorized\n\nPersonnel Keep Out,\" must be posted at each entrance to the active portion of a\nfacility, and at other locations, in sufficient numbers to be seen from any\napproach to this active portion. The legend must be written in English and in\nany other language predominant in the area surrounding the facility\n(\ne.g., facilities in counties bordering the Canadian Province\nof Quebec must post signs in French), and must be legible from a distance of at\nleast 25 feet. Existing signs with a legend other than \"Danger-Unauthorized\n\nPersonnel Keep Out\" may be used if the legend on the sign indicates that only\nauthorized personnel are allowed to enter the active portion, and that entry\nonto the active portion can be dangerous. Note: See section\n373-3.7\n(g) of this\n\nSubpart for discussion of security requirements at disposal facilities during\nthe post-closure care period. (f) General inspection\nrequirements. (1)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must inspect the facility for malfunctions and deterioration, operator\nerrors, and discharges which may be causing or may lead to: (i) release of hazardous waste constituents\nto the environment; or\n(ii)\na\nthreat to human health. The owner or operator must conduct these inspections\noften enough to identify problems in time to correct them before they harm\nhuman health or the environment. (2)\n(i) The\nowner or operator must develop and follow a written schedule for inspecting all\nmonitoring equipment, safety and emergency equipment, security devices, and\noperating and structural equipment (such as dikes and sump pumps) that are\nimportant to preventing, detecting, responding to environmental or human health\nhazards. (ii)\n\nThis schedule must be\nkept at the facility. (iii)\n\nThe\nschedule must identify the types of problems (\ne.g., malfunctions or deterioration) which are to be looked for during the inspection\n(\ne.g., inoperative sump pump, leaking fitting, eroding dike, etc.). (iv)\n\nThe frequency of\ninspection may vary for the items on the schedule. However, the frequency\nshould be based on the rate of deterioration of the equipment and the\nprobability of an environmental or human health incident if the deterioration, malfunction, or any operator error goes undetected between inspections. Areas\nsubject to spills, such as loading and unloading areas, must be inspected daily\nwhen in use. At a minimum, the inspection schedule must include the items and\nfrequencies called for in sections\n373-3.9\n(e), 373-3.10\n(d) and\n(f), 373-3.11\n(e), 373-3.12\n(k), 373-3.13\n(e), 373-3.14\n(l), 373-3.15\n(d), 373-3.16\n(d), 373-3.17\n(d), 373-3.27\n(d), 373-3.28\n(c), (d) and\n(i), and\n373-3.29\n(e) through\n(k) of this Subpart, where applicable. Note: See sections\n373-3.7\n(i), 373-3.13\n(f) and\n373-3.14\n(c) of\nthis Subpart for related requirements. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator must remedy any\ndeterioration or malfunction of equipment or structures which the inspection\nreveals, on a schedule which ensures that the problem does not lead to an\nenvironmental or human health hazard. Where a hazard is imminent or has already\noccurred, remedial action must be taken immediately. (4)\n\nThe owner or operator must record\ninspection in an inspection log or summary. The owner or operator must keep\nthese records for at least three years from the date of inspection. At a\nminimum, these records must include the date and time of the inspection, the\nname of the inspector, a notation of the observations made, and the date and\nnature of any repairs or other remedial actions. (g) Personnel training. (1)\n(i) Facility personnel must successfully complete a program of classroom\ninstruction or on-the-job training that teaches them to perform their duties in\na way that ensures the facility's compliance with the requirements of this\n\nSubpart. The owner or operator must ensure that this program includes all the\nelements described in the document required under subparagraph (4)(iii) of this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nThis program must\nbe directed by a person trained in hazardous waste management procedures, and\nmust include instruction which teaches facility personnel hazardous waste\nmanagement procedures (including contingency plan implementation) relevant to\nthe positions in which they are employed. (iii)\n\nAt a minimum, the training program must\nbe designed to ensure that facility personnel are able to respond effectively\nto emergencies by familiarizing them with emergency procedures, emergency\nequipment and emergency systems, including where applicable: (a) procedures for using, inspecting, repairing and replacing facility emergency and monitoring equipment; (b) key parameters for automatic waste feed\ncutoff systems; (c) communication\nor alarm systems; (d) response to\nfires or explosions; (e) response\nto ground-water contamination incidents; and\n(f) shutdown of operations. (iv)\n\nFor facility employees that\nreceive emergency response training pursuant to Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAdministration (OSHA) regulations\n29 CFR\n1910.120(p)(8)\nand\n1910.120(q)\n(see section 370.1[e] of this Title), the facility is not required to provide\nseparate emergency response training pursuant to this section, provided that\nthe overall facility training meets all the requirements of this\nsection. (2)\n\nFacility\npersonnel must successfully complete the program required in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision within six months after the date of their employment or an\nassignment to a facility, or to a new position at a facility. Employees must\nnot work in unsupervised positions until they have completed the training\nrequirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nFacility personnel must take part in an\nannual review of the initial training required in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (4)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must maintain the following documents and records at the facility: (i) the job for each position at the facility\nrelated to hazardous waste management, and the name of the employee filling\neach job; (ii)\na written job\ndescription for each position listed under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. This description may be consistent in its degree of specificity with\ndescriptions for other similar positions in the same company location or\nbargaining unit, but must include the requisite skill, education or other\nqualifications, and duties of employees assigned to each position; (iii)\na written description of the type and\namount of both introductory and continuing training that will be given to each\nperson filing a position listed under subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph; (iv)\nrecords that\ndocument that the training or job experience required under paragraphs (1), (2)\nand (3) of this subdivision has been given to, and completed by facility\npersonnel. (5)\n\nTraining\nrecords on current personnel must be kept until closure of the facility. Training records on former employees must be kept for at least three years from\nthe date the employee last worked at the facility. Personnel training records\nmay accompany personnel transferred within the same company. (h) General\nrequirements for ignitable, reactive, or incompatible wastes. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator must take\nprecautions to prevent accidental ignition or reaction of ignitable or reactive\nwaste. This waste must be separated and protected from sources of ignition or\nreaction, including but not limited to: open flames, smoking, cutting and\nwelding, hot surfaces, frictional heat, sparks (static, electrical or\nmechanical), spontaneous ignition (\ne.g., from heat-producing\nchemical reactions), and radiant heat. While ignitable or reactive waste is\nbeing handled, the owner or operator must confine smoking and open flame to\nspecially designated locations. \"No Smoking\" signs must be conspicuously placed\nwherever there is a hazard from ignitable or reactive waste. (2)\n\nWhere specifically required by other\nsections of this Subpart, the treatment, storage or disposal of ignitable or\nreactive waste, and the mixture or commingling of incompatible wastes, or\nincompatible wastes and materials, must be conducted so that it does not: (i) generate extreme heat or pressure, fire\nor explosions, or violent reactions; (ii)\nproduce uncontrolled toxic mists, fumes, dusts or gases in sufficient quantities to threaten human health; (iii)\nproduce uncontrolled flammable fumes or\ngases in sufficient quantities to pose a risk of fire or explosions; (iv)\ndamage the structural integrity of the\ndevice or facility containing the waste; or\n(v) through other like means threaten human\nhealth or the environment. (i) Location standards. The placement of any hazardous waste in a salt dome, salt\nbed formation, underground mine or cave is prohibited. (j) Construction quality assurance\nprogram. (1)\nCQA program. (i) A construction quality assurance (CQA)\nprogram is required for all surface impoundment, waste pile, and landfill units\nthat are required to comply with sections\n373-3.11\n(i)(1), 373-3.12\n(h), and\n373-3.14\n(j)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart. The program must ensure that the constructed unit meets or\nexceeds all design criteria and specifications in the permit.

(ii)\n\nThe CQA program must address the\nfollowing physical components, where applicable: (a) foundations; (b) dikes; (c) low-permeability soil liners; (d) geomembranes (flexible membrane\nliners); (e) leachate collection\nand removal systems and leak detection systems; and\n(f) final cover systems. (2)\n\nWritten CQA plan. Before\nconstruction begins on a unit subject to the CQA program under paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision, the owner or operator must develop a written CQA plan. The\nplan must identify steps that will be used to monitor and document the quality\nof materials and the condition and manner of their installation. The CQA plan\nmust include: (i) identification of\napplicable units, and a description of how they will be constructed; (ii)\nidentification of key personnel in the\ndevelopment and implementation of the CQA plan, and CQA officer qualifications; and\n(iii)\na description of\ninspection and sampling activities for all unit components identified in\nsubparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision, including observations and tests that\nwill be used before, during, and after construction to ensure that the\nconstruction materials and the installed unit components meet the design\nspecifications. The description must cover: sampling size and locations; frequency of testing; data evaluation procedures; acceptance and rejection\ncriteria for construction materials; plans for implementing corrective\nmeasures; and data or other information to be recorded and retained in the\noperating record under section\n373-3.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart. (3)\n\nContents of\nprogram. (i) The CQA program must include\nobservations, inspections, tests, and measurements sufficient to ensure: (a) structural stability and integrity of all\ncomponents of the unit identified in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this\nsubdivision; (b) proper\nconstruction of all components of the liners, leachate collection and removal\nsystem, leak detection system, and final cover system, according to permit\nspecifications and good engineering practices, and proper installation of all\ncomponents (\ne.g., pipes) according to design\nspecifications; (c) conformity of\nall materials used with design and other material specifications under sections\n373-2.12\n(b), and\n373-2.14\n(c) of\nthis Part. (ii)\n\nThe CQA\nprogram shall include test fills for compacted soil liners, using the same\ncompaction methods as in the full-scale unit, to ensure that the liners are\nconstructed to meet the hydraulic conductivity requirements of sections\n373-2.11\n(b)(3)(i), 373-2.12\n(b)(3)(i), and\n373-2.14\n(c)(3)(i)\nof this Part in the field. Compliance with the hydraulic conductivity\nrequirements must be verified by using in situ testing on the constructed test\nfill. The test fill requirement is waived where data are sufficient to show\nthat a constructed soil liner meets the hydraulic conductivity requirements of\nsections\n373-2.11\n(b)(3)(i), 373-2.12\n(b)(3)(i), and\n373-2.14\n(c)(3)(i)\nof this Part in the field. (4)\n\nCertification. The owner or operator of\nunits subject to this subdivision must submit to the commissioner, by certified\nmail or hand delivery, at least 30 days prior to receiving waste, a\ncertification signed by the CQA officer that the CQA plan has been successfully\ncarried out and that the unit meets the requirements of section\n373-3.11\n(i)(1), 373-3.12\n(h), or\n373-3.14\n(j)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart. The owner or operator may receive waste in the unit after 30 days\nfrom the commissioner's receipt of the CQA certification unless the\ncommissioner determines in writing that the construction is not acceptable, or\nextends the review period for a maximum of 30 more days, or seeks additional\ninformation from the owner or operator during this period. Documentation\nsupporting the CQA officer's certification must be furnished to the\ncommissioner upon request. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
