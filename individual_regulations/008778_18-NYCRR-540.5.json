It is desirable that the acceptance of the\nnotification be issued to the vendor in writing, but, if the public welfare\nofficial prefers, he may arrange wth the vendor that acceptance of liability\nmay be assumed unless a notice of rejection is received by the vendor. Whether\nor not the acceptance of liability is issued to the vendor in writing, a\nwritten authorization containing the minimum essentials listed below shall be\nforwarded by the authorizing official to the disbursing unit of the public\nwelfare agency, the information contained in such written authorization\nbecoming the basis for payment by the disbursing unit of the agency to the\nmedical vendor. Such authorizations shall be subject to the same limitations\nand control as are specified in section\n540.6\nof this Part. (2)\n\nDecision as to acceptance or rejection of\nnotification and request for authorization shall be made as promptly as\npossible by the public welfare official. (3)\n\nIf the notification and request for\nauthorization is accepted by the public welfare official, the authorization to\nthe vendor (or vendors) shall contain, as a minimum, the following information: (i) case identification and patient\ndesignation; (ii)\neffective date of\nservices for which public welfare official assumes liability; (iii)\nexpiration date of\nauthorization; (iv)\nvolume of\nservice authorized; (v) type, character or nature of services authorized; (vi)\nvendor authorized to provide such\nservices; (vii)\nsource of payment\n(if other than agency); (viii)\nsignature of authorizing official and date of issuance; (ix)\nsignature of supervisor of medical\nservices, when required by nature of service. (4)\n\nThe agency shall utilize a form of\nauthorization containing such minimal information, as illustrated in section B\nof illustrative form M-1, contained in the instructions of the\ndepartment. (5)\n(i) After May 14, 1976, the local social\nservices official shall authorize medical assistance payments only after\nobtaining documentation of the following actions for persons admitted on or\nafter May 14, 1976 to skilled nursing facilities holding title XVIII provider\nagreements: (a) that the Commissioner of\n\nHealth or his designee has approved admission and continued stay in a skilled\nnursing facility; and\n(b) that the\nadmitting facility has prepared written justification of the decision not to\nmake application to Medicare because of the patient's apparent technical\nineligibility; or\n(c) that\napplication has been made for Medicare benefits and rejected as being\nineligible; and\n(d) that\nreconsideration of the Medicare rejection has been initiated or, when the\nskilled nursing facility agrees with Medicare's reasons for rejecting, a\nwritten justification of their agreement has been submitted to the local\nmedical director. (ii)\n\nSkilled nursing facilities shall not be required to initiate requests for\nreconsideration in cases where they agree with Medicare's rejection. The\n\nCommissioner of Health or his designee, however, shall review the skilled\nnursing facility's justifications for agreeing with Medicare. In those\ninstances in which the Commissioner of Health or his designee disagrees with\nthe Medicare rejection, the social services official shall require the skilled\nnursing facility to initiate a reconsideration of Medicare's\ndecision. (iii)\n\nShould the Medicare\nreconsideration process fail to reverse the initial rejection, the local social\nservices district shall assume responsibility for insuring that a Medicare\nappeal is initiated in each appropriate instance. (iv)\n\nAppeals, when deemed to be appropriate, must be initiated within 14 calendar days of the date of the fiscal\nintermediary's notification that the reconsideration process had failed to\nreverse the original decision.
