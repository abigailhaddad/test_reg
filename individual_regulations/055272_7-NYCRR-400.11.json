  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 400.11 - Appeals procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An\napplicant for a moving expense and/or replacement housing payment shall be\nnotified promptly in writing concerning his eligibility for the payment\nclaimed; the amount, if any, he is entitled to receive, and the time and manner\nin which such payment will be made. If any or all of the amounts claimed are\ndisallowed or require additional documentation, the eligible person will be so\nnotified in writing to this effect. (b) If the claimant is not satisfied with the\npayment offered, he may within 18 months of vacating or six months after final\naward determination by the courts of the State request an informal conference\nto present his case. When requested, such a conference is scheduled in the\nregional office conducted by the local real property officer. The claimant may\nbring whomever he wishes to represent him or present some facet of his claim. The decision of the local real property officer will be made in writing\ndirected to the claimant or his representative and may be appealed to the\ndirector of real property. (c) The\ndirector of real property shall then make an independent determination\naccording to the data submitted to him by the claimant and the local real\nproperty officer. This determination will be made in writing to the\nclaimant. (d) In the event the\nclaimant is not satisfied with the results achieved at this stage he may then\nrequest a formal hearing. This request will be directed to the director of real\nproperty. The formal hearing will be conducted by a hearing officer designated\nby the commissioner at a time and place to be determined by the hearing\nofficer. Minutes of the proceedings will be taken. (e) Based upon all the evidence produced at\nthe hearing, the hearing officer will make his recommendation to the\ncommissioner who will then make a final determination regarding the claim\npresented. (f) In the instance of\nan appeal, no payment of such calculated moving expenses or supplemental\nhousing and related benefits is to be made until a decision has been rendered\nby the director. In the instance where an owner files a claim in the Court of\n\nClaims for adjudication of the fair market value of the property acquired, and\nsimilarly files for an appeal hearing disputing the amount of the supplemental\npayment proffered, no appeal hearing will be held until final award\ndetermination by the courts of the State.
