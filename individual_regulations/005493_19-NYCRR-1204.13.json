  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 1204.13 - Agency relationships\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No\nconstruction-permitting agency shall delegate or transfer its authority to\nissue construction permits, code compliance certificates, or temporary\napprovals for occupancy to another State agency or to another party. (b) Except as prohibited in subdivision (a)\nof this section, State agencies may arrange for the performance of required\ncode related activities through agreements with other State agencies or other\nparties. Such agreement, however, shall not exempt a State agency from the\nobligation to appoint a code coordinator, to prepare an annual report pursuant\nto section\n1204.14\nof this Title and to\ncomply with provisions of the Uniform Code. (c) When more than one\nconstruction-permitting agency is involved in a particular construction\nproject, such agencies may agree among themselves as to which agency shall act\nas the construction-permitting agency for the project. In the event of a\ndispute as to which agency shall act as construction-permitting agency, a\ndecision shall be made based upon the following order of preference: (1)\nthe design agency; (2)\nthe construction agency; or\n(3)\nthe agency owning or with custody of the\nparticular building or structure. If the agencies involved are unable to agree, the Department\nof State shall be the final arbiter in determining which agency shall act as\nconstruction-permitting agency. (d) When no construction-permitting agency is\ndesigning or constructing a specific project, the Office of General Services\nshall act as the construction-permitting agency for the project. Except for the\n\nOffice of General Services, designation as a construction-permitting agency\ndoes not obligate a State agency to undertake construction-permitting\nresponsibilities for any project for which the agency has no design or\nconstruction role. (e) When an\nagency occupies a building or a portion thereof which is owned by or in the\ncustody of another State agency, the agency occupying the space must notify the\nagency with custody or ownership of any physical changes to the building which\nare proposed or which are needed to achieve compliance with applicable\nprovisions of the Uniform Code. (f) In response to allegations of code violations or for other good cause, the\n\nDepartment of State, after notice to the agency or agencies involved, may\ninspect any building or construction activity in the custody of a State\nagency. (g) In the event of a\ndispute arising between State agencies concerning the application of this Part, the Department of State, at the request of any party and after consultation\nwith all the parties, may make a ruling binding on all parties. (h) To the maximum extent practicable, a\n\nState agency acting pursuant to this Part shall consult with any other\ngovernmental entities providing services, under authority of other laws, to\nthose areas where the authority conferred by this Part is exercised.
