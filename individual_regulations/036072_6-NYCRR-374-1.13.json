  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 374-1.13 - Military munitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nThe\nregulations in this section identify when military munitions become a solid\nwaste, and, if these wastes are also hazardous under this section or Part 371\nof this Title, the management standards that apply to these wastes. (2)\n\nUnless otherwise specified in this\nsection, all applicable requirements in Part 370 through Subpart 374-1 and Part\n376 of this Title apply to waste military munitions. (b) Definitions. In addition to the definitions in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle, the following definitions apply to this section: (1)\n\nActive range\nmeans a\nmilitary range that is currently in service and is being regularly used for\nrange activities. (2)\n\nChemical agents and munitions\nare defined as in\n50\nU.S.C. section\n1521(j)(1), as incorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title. (3)\n\nDirector\nis as defined\nin section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (4)\n\nExplosives or\nmunitions emergency response specialist\nis as defined in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (5)\n\nExplosives or\nmunitions emergency\nis as defined in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (6)\n\nExplosives or\nmunitions emergency response\nis as defined in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (7)\n\nInactive\nrange\nmeans a military range that is not currently being used, but\nthat is still under military control and considered by the military to be a\npotential range area, and that has not been put to a new use that is\nincompatible with range activities. (8)\n\nMilitary\nmeans the\n\nDepartment of Defense (DOD), the Armed Services, Coast Guard, National Guard, Department of Energy (DOE), or other parties under contract or acting as an\nagent for the foregoing, who handle military munitions. (9)\n\nMilitary munitions\nis as\ndefined in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (10)\n\nMilitary\nrange\nmeans designated land and water areas set aside, managed, and\nused to conduct research on, develop, test, and evaluate military munitions and\nexplosives, other ordnance, or weapon systems, or to train military personnel\nin their use and handling. Ranges include firing lines and positions, maneuver\nareas, firing lanes, test pads, detonation pads, impact areas, and buffer zones\nwith restricted access and exclusionary areas. (11)\n\nUnexploded ordnance\n(UXO)\nmeans military munitions that have been primed, fused, armed, or\notherwise prepared for action, and have been fired, dropped, launched, projected, or placed in such a manner as to constitute a hazard to operations, installation, personnel, or material and remain unexploded either by\nmalfunction, design, or any other cause. (c) Definition of solid waste. (1)\nA military munition is not a solid waste\nwhen: (i) Used for its intended purpose, including: (a) use in training military\npersonnel or explosives and munitions emergency response specialists (including\ntraining in proper destruction of unused propellant or other munitions); or\n(b) use in research, development, testing, and evaluation of military munitions, weapons, or weapon\nsystems; or\n(c) recovery, collection, and on-range destruction of unexploded ordnance and munitions\nfragments during range clearance activities at active or inactive ranges. However, \" use for intended purpose\" does not include the on-range disposal or\nburial of unexploded ordnance and contaminants when the burial is not a result\nof product use. (ii)\n\nAn\nunused munition, or component thereof, is being repaired, reused, recycled, reclaimed, disassembled, reconfigured, or otherwise subjected to materials\nrecovery activities, unless such activities involve use constituting disposal\nas defined in section\n371.1\n(c)(4)(i)\nof\nthis Title, or burning for energy recovery as defined in section\n371.1\n(c)(4)(ii)\nof\nthis Title. (2)\n\nAn\nunused military munition is a solid waste when any of the following occurs: (i) the munition is abandoned by being\ndisposed of, burned, detonated (except during intended use as specified in\nparagraph [1] of this subdivision), incinerated, or treated prior to\ndisposal; (ii)\nthe munition is\nremoved from storage in a military magazine or other storage area for the\npurpose of being disposed of, burned, or incinerated, or treated prior to\ndisposal; (iii)\nthe munition is\ndeteriorated or damaged (\ne.g., the integrity of the munition\nis compromised by cracks, leaks, or other damage) to the point that it cannot\nbe put into serviceable condition, and cannot reasonably be recycled or used\nfor other purposes; or\n(iv)\nthe\nmunition has been declared a solid waste by an authorized military\nofficial. (3)\nA used or\nfired military munition is a solid waste: (i) when transported off range or from the site of use, where the site of use is\nnot a range, for the purposes of storage, reclamation, treatment, disposal, or\ntreatment prior to disposal; or\n(ii)\nif recovered, collected, and then\ndisposed of by burial, or landfilling either on or off a range. (4)\n\nFor purposes of ECL 27-0701.1, a used or fired military munition is a solid waste, and, therefore, is\npotentially subject to corrective action authorities under ECL 27-0911 and\n71-2727.3, or imminent and substantial endangerment authorities under ECL\n71-0301, if the munition lands off-range and is not promptly rendered safe\nand/or retrieved. Any imminent and substantial threats associated with any\nremaining material must be addressed. If remedial action is infeasible, the\noperator of the range must maintain a record of the event for as long as any\nthreat remains. The record must include the type of munition and its location\n(to the extent the location is known). (d) Standards applicable to the\ntransportation of solid waste military munitions. Waste military munitions that are being transported and\nthat exhibit a hazardous waste characteristic or are listed as hazardous waste\nunder Part 371 of this Title are subject to regulation under Parts 370 through\n374 and 376 of this Title. In addition, the transporter of the waste must\nprovide oral notice to the department within 24 hours from the time the\ntransporter becomes aware of any loss or theft of the waste military munitions. In addition, a written submission describing the circumstances shall be\nprovided within five days from the time the transporter becomes aware of any\nloss or theft of the waste military munitions. (e) Standards applicable to emergency\nresponses. Explosives and munitions emergencies involving military\nmunitions or explosives are subject to sections\n372.1\n(b)(3)(i) and\n(ii)\nand\n373-1.1\n(d)(1)(xiii)\nof this Title, or alternatively to section\n621.12\nof this\n\nTitle. (f) Standards\napplicable to the storage of solid waste military munitions. (1)\n\nCriteria for hazardous waste regulation\nof waste non-chemical military munitions in storage. (i) Waste military munitions in storage that\nexhibit a hazardous waste characteristic or are listed as hazardous waste under\n\nPart 371 of this Title, are listed or identified as a hazardous waste (and thus\nare subject to regulation under Parts 370 through 374 and Part 376 of this\n\nTitle), unless all the following conditions are met: (a) The waste military munitions are not\nchemical agents or chemical munitions. (b) The waste military munitions must be\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense Explosives Safety\n\nBoard (DDESB). (c) The waste\nmilitary munitions must be stored in accordance with the DDESB storage\nstandards applicable to waste military munitions, as incorporated by reference\nin section 370.1(e) of this Title. (d) Within 90 days of August 12, 1997 or\nwithin 90 days of when a storage unit is first used to store waste military\nmunitions, whichever is later, the owner or operator must notify the director\nof the location of any waste storage unit used to store waste military\nmunitions for which the conditional exemption in this subparagraph is\nclaimed. (e) The owner or operator\nmust provide oral notice to the director within 24 hours from the time the\nowner or operator becomes aware of any loss or theft of the waste military\nmunitions, or any failure to meet a condition of this subparagraph that may\nendanger health or the environment. In addition, a written submission\ndescribing the circumstances shall be provided within five days from the time\nthe owner or operator becomes aware of any loss or theft of the waste military\nmunitions or any failure to meet a condition of this subparagraph. (f) The owner or operator must inventory the\nwaste military munitions at least annually, must inspect the waste military\nmunitions at least quarterly for compliance with the conditions of this\nsubparagraph, and must maintain records of the findings of these inventories\nand inspections for at least three years. (g) Access to the stored waste military\nmunitions must be limited to appropriately trained and authorized\npersonnel. (h) The waste military\nmunitions must be stored at a government-owned facility. (ii)\n\nThe conditional exemption in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph from regulation as hazardous waste shall\napply only to the storage of non-chemical waste military munitions. It does not\naffect the regulatory status of waste military munitions as hazardous wastes\nwith regard to transportation, treatment or disposal. (iii)\n\nThe conditional exemption in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph applies only so long as all of the\nconditions in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph are met. (2)\n\nNotice of termination of waste storage. The owner or operator must notify the director when a storage unit identified\nin clause (1)(i)(\nd\n) of this subdivision will no longer be used\nto store waste military munitions. (3)\n\nReinstatement of conditional exemption. If any waste military munition loses its conditional exemption under\nsubparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision, an application may be filed with the\ndirector for reinstatement of the conditional exemption from hazardous waste\nstorage regulation with respect to such munition as soon as the munition is\nreturned to compliance with the conditions of subparagraph (1)(i) of this\nsubdivision. If the director finds that reinstatement of the conditional\nexemption is appropriate based on factors such as the owner's or operator's\nprovision of a satisfactory explanation of the circumstances of the violation, or a demonstration that the violations are not likely to recur, the director\nmay reinstate the conditional exemption under subparagraph (1)(i) of this\nsubdivision. If the director does not take action on the reinstatement\napplication within 60 days after receipt of the application, then reinstatement\nshall be deemed granted, retroactive to the date of the application. However, the director may terminate a conditional exemption reinstated by default in the\npreceding sentence if he/she finds that reinstatement is inappropriate based on\nfactors such as the owner's or operator's failure to provide a satisfactory\nexplanation of the circumstances of the violation, or failure to demonstrate\nthat the violations are not likely to recur. In reinstating the conditional\nexemption under subparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision, the director may\nspecify additional conditions as are necessary to ensure and document proper\nstorage to protect human health and the environment. (4)\n\nWaste chemical munitions. (i) Waste military munitions that are\nchemical agents or chemical munitions and that exhibit a hazardous waste\ncharacteristic or are listed as hazardous waste under Part 371 of this Title, are listed or identified as a hazardous waste and shall be subject to the\napplicable regulatory requirements of Parts 370 through 374 and 376 of this\n\nTitle. (ii)\n\nWaste military\nmunitions that are chemical agents or chemical munitions and that exhibit a\nhazardous waste characteristic or are listed as hazardous waste under Part 371\nof this Title, are not subject to the storage prohibition in section\n376.5\n(a) of this\n\nTitle. (5)\nDDESB storage\nstandards. The DDESB storage standards applicable to waste military munitions, referenced in clause (1)(i)(\nc\n) of this subdivision, are DOD\n6055.9-STD (\"DOD Ammunition and Explosive Safety Standards\"), as incorporated\nby reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title. (g) Standards applicable to the\ntreatment and disposal of waste military munitions. The treatment and disposal of hazardous waste military\nmunitions are subject to the applicable permitting, procedural, and technical\nstandards in Parts 370 through 374 and 376 of this Title.
