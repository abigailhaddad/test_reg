  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1644-2.4 - Allocation of interest charges to related programs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Related programs comprise offsite\nclearance, rehabilitation, and relocation of buildings. Interest charges on\nfunds borrowed or earmarked for related programs are capitalized as a\ndevelopment cost and charged to the cost of those programs. Such programs may\nextend beyond the date of substantial completion, into the operating period of\nthe project proper. Local agencies conducting such programs in connection with\nthe development of the project proper will therefore find it necessary to\ncharge interest, in the first instance, to account 1420.1, Interest Expense, and to account 4716, Interest on Indebtedness, whichever is applicable, and\nthen by journal voucher, credit the expense accounts and charge the appropriate\ndevelopment cost accounts (1440.16, Offsite Clearance; 1440.17, Rehabilitation\nand 1440.18, Relocation of Buildings). For funds borrowed prior to the issuance\nof housing bonds by the State, the allocation of the interest charges is in the\nproportion of the amount requisitioned for the related program on the most\nrecent approved certificate of purposes (form DH-216) to the total amount\nborrowed for all purposes. (b) For\nfunds borrowed subsequent to the issue of housing bonds, the interest on the\nfunds representing the bond issue proceeds is allocated to the related program\nin the proportion of the amount borrowed for the related program on the bond\nsale budget to the total amount of the bond issue borrowed for all purposes. Should temporary loan notes be outstanding simultaneously with the bond issue, the interest on the temporary loan notes is allocated in the same manner as the\ninterest on temporary loan notes issued prior to the issuance of housing\nbonds. (c) The allocation of\ninterest charges to the rehabilitation program and relocation of buildings\nprogram should continue to be made until the programs are liquidated and closed\nout. The allocation of interest should continue to be made to the offsite\nclearance program until the project proper is declared substantially completed\nor the offsite program is liquidated, whichever is earlier. Upon the date of\nsubstantial completion of the project proper, the allocation of interest to the\noffsite program shall cease and all interest on all borrowed funds shall be\ncharged to operations. A transfer of funds from the development fund to the\nadministration fund shall further be required for interest allocable to related\nprograms and paid out of the administration fund. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1644-2.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
