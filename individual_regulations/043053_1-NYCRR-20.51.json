  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 20.51 - Basic formula price\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe basic formula price shall be the preceding month's\naverage pay price for manufacturing grade milk in Minnesota and Wisconsin using\nthe \"base month\" series, as reported by the United States Department of\n\nAgriculture, adjusted to a 3.5 percent butterfat basis using the butterfat\ndifferential for the preceding month computed pursuant to section\n20.81\nof this Part and rounded to\nthe nearest cent, plus or minus the change in gross value yielded by the\nbutter-nonfat dry milk and cheddar cheese product price formula computed\npursuant to subdivisions (a) through (e) of this section. (a) The gross values of per hundredweight of\nmilk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and cheddar cheese shall be\ncomputed, using price data determined pursuant to subdivision (b) of this\nsection and annual yield factors, for the preceding month and separately for\nthe current month as follows: (1)\n\nThe gross\nvalue of milk used to manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk shall be the sum of\nthe following computations: (i) multiply the\n\nGrade AA butter price by 4.27; and\n(ii)\nmultiply the nonfat dry milk price by\n0.42. (2)\n\nThe gross\nvalue of milk used to manufacture, cheddar cheese shall be the sum of the\nfollowing computations: (i) multiply the\ncheddar cheese price by 9.87: and\n(ii)\nmultiply the Grade A butter price by\n0.238. (b) The following product prices shall be used pursuant to subdivision (a) of this\nsection: (1)\n\nGrade AA butter price. Grade AA\nbutter price means the simple average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile\n\nExchange, Grade AA butter price, as reported by the United States Department of\n\nAgriculture. (2)\n\nNonfat dry milk\nprice. Nonfat dry milk price means the simple average for the month of the\nwestern nonfat dry milk low medium heat price, as reported by the United States\n\nDepartment of Agriculture. (3)\n\nDry\nbuttermilk price. Dry buttermilk price means the simple average for the month\nof the western dry buttermilk price, as reported by the United States\n\nDepartment of Agriculture. (4)\n\nCheddar cheese price. Cheddar cheese price means the simple average for the\nmonth of the National Cheese Exchange 40-pound block cheddar cheese price, as\nreported by the United States Department of Agriculture. (5)\n\nGrade A butter price. Grade A butter\nprice means the simple average for the month of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange\n\nGrade A butter price, as reported by the United States Department of\n\nAgriculture. (c) Determine the amounts by which the gross value per hundredweight of milk used\nto manufacture butter-nonfat dry milk and the gross value per hundredweight of\nmilk used to manufacture cheddar cheese for the current month exceed or are\nless than the respective gross values for the preceding month. (d) Compute weighting factors to be applied\nto the changes in gross values determined pursuant to subdivision (c) of this\nsection by determining the relative proportion that the data included in each\nof the following paragraphs is of the total of the data represented in\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision: (1)\ncombine the total nonfat dry milk\nproduction for the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, as reported by the United\n\nStates Department of Agriculture, for the most recent preceding period, and\ndivide by the annual yield factor for nonfat dry milk, 8.07, to determine the\nquantity (in hundredweights) of milk used in the production of butter-nonfat\ndry milk; and\n(2)\ncombine the total\n\nAmerican cheese production for the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin, as\nreported by the United States Department of Agriculture, for the most recent\nreporting period, and divide by the annual yield factor for cheddar cheese, 9.87 to determine the quantity (in hundredweights) of milk used in the\nproduction of American cheese. (e) Compute a weighted average of the changes\nin gross values per hundredweight of milk determined pursuant to subdivision\n(c) of this section in accordance with the relative proportions of milk\ndetermined pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section.
