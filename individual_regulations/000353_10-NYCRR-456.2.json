  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 456.2 - Statistics and sampling\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A standard\nstatistical allocation has been set forth for each functional reporting center. This prescribed minimum statistic must be reported based on residential health\ncare facility records for functional reporting centers which have their own\ndirect costs as well as centers which may receive only indirect costs as a\nresult of cost finding. (b) Alternative statistics may be developed and utilized for cost allocation of a\nfunctional center if such alternative basis had been used in the past and\napproved through audit by the third-party reimbursement agency\nauditor. (c) However, a residential\nhealth care facility utilizing an alternative statistical basis must also\nreport the minimal acceptable statistics set forth in this Part. A residential\nhealth care facility wishing to change its statistical allocation basis at any\ntime in the future must collect the data and submit same to the New York State\n\nDepartment of Health, or other body if established, for approval as an\nexception to the approved cost allocation basis before it can be used. See\nprocedure for same in Part 457 of this Article. Once an alternative statistic\nis used, it must remain in use until approval is given to alter the approved\nstatistical basis. (d) It is\nunderstood that in some instances a residential health care facility may not be\nable to accumulate the statistics for a full year. Under these circumstances, the residential health care facility may use a sample for accumulation of the\ndata. A discussion of the sampling technique is presented in section\n456.4\nof this Part. The minimum\nmandated statistical basis for cost allocation is presented in section\n456.3. A more precise definition\nfor the compilation of the data is provided in section\n456.5. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n456.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
