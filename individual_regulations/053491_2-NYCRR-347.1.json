  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 347.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn 1989, the Legislature amended sections\n17\nand\n317\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw to provide that employer contributions to New York State and Local\n\nEmployees' Retirement System and the New York State and Local Police and Fire\n\nRetirement System for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1990 shall be due on\n\nDecember 15, 1989, rather than June 30, 1991. These sections were also amended\nto provide that employer contributions for all future State fiscal years shall\nbe due on December fifteenth of such year, commencing with the payment due on\n\nDecember 15, 1990 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1991. The same\nlegislation also enacted Retirement and Social Security Law sections 17-a and\n317-a, which essentially provide for the amortization at 8.75 percent over 17\nyears of the two payments that would otherwise have been due by June 30, 1989\nand June 30, 1990. The first amortization payment must be made by December 15, 1989. Under the above provisions, employers may make prepayment of amortized\ncontributions and the Retirement Systems shall, every year, reamortize the\nremaining principal balance over the remaining years. This Part is promulgated\nto set forth procedures for prepayment of such amortization payments. Sections\n17-a and 317-a expressly and specifically require the Comptroller to promulgate\na regulation which includes the provisions contained herein as sections 347.2\nand\n347.3\nof this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n347.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
