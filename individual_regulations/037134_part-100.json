Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 22, subtit. A, ch. I, subch. C, pt. 100\n\nStatutory authority: Constitution, art. VI, § 20\nPREAMBLE: PREAMBLE:The rules governing judicial\nconduct are rules of reason. They should be applied consistently with\nconstitutional requirements, statutes, other court rules and decisional law and\nin the context of all relevant circumstances. The rules are to be construed so\nas not to impinge on the essential independence of judges in making judicial\ndecisions. PREAMBLE:The rules are designed to provide\nguidance to judges and candidates for elective judicial office and to provide a\nstructure for regulating conduct through disciplinary agencies. They are not\ndesigned or intended as a basis for civil liability or criminal\nprosecution. PREAMBLE:The text of the rules is intended\nto govern conduct of judges and candidates for elective judicial office and to\nbe binding upon them. It is not intended, however, that every transgression\nwill result in disciplinary action. Whether disciplinary action is appropriate, and the degree of discipline to be imposed, should be determined through a\nreasonable and reasoned application of the text and should depend on such\nfactors as the seriousness of the transgression, whether there is a pattern of\nimproper activity and the effect of the improper activity on others or on the\njudicial system. PREAMBLE:The rules are not intended as an\nexhaustive guide for conduct. Judges and judicial candidates also should be\ngoverned in their judicial and personal conduct by general ethical standards. The rules are intended, however, to state basic standards which should govern\ntheir conduct and to provide guidance to assist them in establishing and\nmaintaining high standards of judicial and personal\nconduct. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
