  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 591.4 - Project ranking procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Funds available for State projects under\nthe 1986 Environmental Quality Bond Act are finite. It is in the best interest\nof the public for the State, from the pool of eligible projects, to choose\nthose which will best achieve the bond act objectives of long-term\npreservation, enhancement, restoration and improvement of the State's\nenvironment. In order to assure that these objectives are carried out within\nthe limits of available funding, priority ranking systems for eligible projects\nare established. Priority ranking of various State projects is achieved by\nidentifying the characteristics possessed by a given project which provide\nnatural resource value and help achieve bond act objectives. Then, using the\nranking system forest preserve projects contained in subdivision (c) of this\nsection or the ranking system for a given category or subcategory of\nenvironmentally sensitive lands project contained in subdivisions (d) through\n(m) of this section, a rating is assigned to each characteristic indicating\nthat characteristic's relative importance in contributing to program\nobjectives. Unless otherwise indicated, the sum of the ratings is the proposed\nproject's ranking score. It is recognized that a project under any given\ncategory of environmentally sensitive lands may meet the minimum eligibility\nrequirements of one or more other categories of environmentally sensitive\nlands. The acquisition of such a project would protect additional natural\nresource values, thus providing multiple benefits to the public. Whenever such\nmultiple benefits are identified, an amount equal to 10 per centum of the total\nachievable rating under the primary category will be added for the first\nadditional category of environmentally sensitive land identified as a multiple\nbenefit, eight per centum for the second additional category, six per centum\nfor the third additional category, four per centum for the fourth additional\ncategory and two per centum for the fifth additional category. Each rating\nsystem is different and results in a number that has meaning only in relation\nto the range of possible ratings within that system. The maximum natural\nresource value rating for each rating system is stated so that the relevance of\nany particular rating will be clearer. (b) While there may be natural resource\nvalues that are common to several of the rating systems, vulnerability is the\nonly characteristic that is common to and used by all the rating systems. Accordingly, in order to ensure consistency in the use of the term, this\nsubdivision defines vulnerability and establishes the method for determining a\nvulnerability rating. (1)\n\nVulnerability is the\nmeasure of the degree of urgency for acquisition by the State in order to\npreserve the resource. Vulnerability is expressed as a \"A,\" \"B,\" \"C\" or \"D\"\nrating for each project that has been determined to meet minimum eligibility\nrequirements, based on the reasonable expectation of substantial adverse impact\nto the resource and the immediacy of such impact if the project is not acquired\nby the State. In determining the expectation of impact the following factors, together with such additional factors as may be appropriate, may be considered: (i) the present condition of the\nsite; (ii)\nany announced plans for\nthe site, including their nature, timing, scope and environmental\ncompatibility; (iii)\nany pending\napplications for any form of governmental approval for the use or development\nof the site; (iv)\nthe transfer or\nproposed transfer of ownership of the site including the public offering of the\nsite for sale; and\n(v) the\nrelationship of the proposed plans or applications with the overall land use\nplan or pattern of the affected municipality. (2)\n\nFor purposes of defining the immediacy of\nthe expectation, the following time periods will be utilized: (i) less than two years; (ii)\nmore than two but less than five\nyears; (iii)\nmore than five but\nless than 10 years; or\n(iv)\nbeyond\n10 years. (3)\n\nThe\nratings of A, B, C and D are defined based on the determination of the\nexpectation and immediacy of substantial adverse impact as follows: A-substantial adverse impact is expected to occur within\ntwo years; B-substantial adverse impact is expected to occur; the time\nof occurrence is beyond two but less than five years; C-substantial adverse impact is likely to occur; the time\nof occurrence is beyond five but less than 10 years; D-substantial adverse impact may occur at some time beyond\n10 years. Once derived by the application of this rating scale, the\nvulnerability rating will be incorporated into the natural resource value\nrating of each project meeting minimum eligibility requirements as more fully\ndefined in each of the rating systems set forth in this section. The\nvulnerability rating is not included within the maximum natural resource value\nrating score set forth at the beginning of each of the rating systems. (c) Forest\npreserve. If a proposed project meets the minimum eligibility\nrequirements set forth in section\n591.3\n(c) of this\n\nPart, then it must be assigned to one of the following subcategories according\nto the primary objective of the acquisition: preserves wild, scenic or\nrecreational river corridors; completes wilderness, primitive or canoe areas; consolidates forest preserve; provides recreational opportunity; preserves\necologically significant areas; preserves scenic areas or views including\nscenic highway corridors; enhances access to forest preserve. Proposed\nacquisition projects once so assigned will be rated only against other proposed\nprojects within the same subcategory in accordance with the following: (1)\n\nThe proposed project contributes to the\npreservation of a river corridor designated as wild, scenic or recreational or\neligible for inclusion in the wild, scenic or recreational river system\npursuant to title 27 of article 15 of the Environmental Conservation Law, and/or provides public access thereto.

(v) The\nrating derived from the vulnerability scale contained in subdivision (b) of\nthis section is integrated into the natural resource value rating by adding to\nthe natural value an amount determined as follows: Vulnerability\nrating\n\nAmount to be added\nA\n17\nB\n11\nC\n6\nD\n1\n(vi)\n\nOutstanding streams. Following\ncalculation of the natural resource value rating and the vulnerability rating\nof all eligible streams on the basis of the rating system set forth in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, a range of point totals from 5 to 100 will\nresult. Streams achieving a 100-point total will be classed\noutstanding\nas a group, and will be further evaluated for the\nassignment of bonus points according to the following additional criteria: (a) Stream supports substantial recognized\nmultispecies salmon run providing an extended fishing season for trophy class\nfish. Add 10 points. (b) Stream\nmeets above criteria and currently provides in excess of 150,000 angler trips\nper year and/or currently receives unacceptably high use per unit area of\npublic water. Add 20 points. (c) Outstanding streams will thus receive ratings of 100 to 130. (vii)\n\nIn applying this ranking\nsystem, the proposed project will be assigned to one of the following\nclassifications: (a) coldwater streams which\nare defined as those where trout (salmonids) predominate; or\n(b) warmwater streams which are defined as\nthose where nontrout, commercial or sport fish predominate; or\n(c) tributaries of the Hudson River which are\ndefined as any tributary of the Hudson River, south of the Federal dam at Troy, upstream to the first barrier impassable to fish. Proposed acquisition projects once so classified will be\nevaluated using the priority rating system only against other proposed projects\nwithin the same classification.
