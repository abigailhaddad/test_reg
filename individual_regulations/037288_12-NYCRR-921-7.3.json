  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 921-7.3 - Violation; liability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An\nemployer who fails to give notice to an employee entitled to receive notice\nunder this Part, is liable to each such employee, including part-time employees\nfor: (1)\n\nBack pay at the average regular rate\nof compensation received by the employee during the three years prior to the\ndate of termination, or the employee's final rate of compensation, whichever is\nhigher. (i) Calculation for employees\nreceiving hourly based pay. The average regular rate of compensation is\ncalculated by dividing the total regular and overtime wages earned by the\nemployee during the three years prior to the date of termination by the number\nof hours worked over the same three-year period. The final rate of compensation\nis calculated by dividing the amount received by the employee in their last\npaycheck prior to termination divided by the number of hours worked. (ii)\n\nCalculation for employees receiving pay\nother than hourly based pay. The average regular rate of compensation is\ncalculated by dividing the total regular and overtime wages earned by the\nemployee during the three years prior to the date of termination by the number\nof days worked over the same three-year period. The final rate of compensation\nis calculated by dividing the amount received by the employee in their last\npaycheck prior to termination divided by the number of days worked. The number\nof days worked is the number of days the employee was in active employment\nstatus. (2)\n\nIn the case\nof an employee who became an employee of their current employer through a\nmerger or consolidation of their former employer with/into their current\nemployer, such employee's history of wage and benefit payments from their prior\nemployer shall be treated as if such wages and benefits were earned with their\ncurrent employer for purposes of making any calculations that are required\nunder this Part, including the payment of back wages and benefits\ndue. (3)\n\nThe value of the cost of\nany benefits to which the employee would have been entitled had his or her\nemployment not been lost, including the cost of any medical expenses incurred\nby the employee that would have been covered under an employee benefit plan. Benefits that the Commissioner will consider shall include, but not be limited\nto: health benefits, private disability coverage, life insurance, employer paid\nretirement contributions, and vacation leave. (4)\n\nWhere the commissioner determines that an\nemployer has failed to provide sufficient wage, hour, or benefit information to\ncalculate such employer's liability in accordance with the methodologies\noutlined in this section, the commissioner may use alternative methodologies\nusing any available data, information, and statistics to calculate such\nemployer's liability. (b) Back pay and other liability under the\n\nAct is calculated for the period of the employer's violation, up to a maximum\nof 60 days, or one-half the number of days that the employee was employed by\nthe employer, whichever period is smaller. (c) The amount of an employer's liability, under this section, shall be reduced by the following: (1)\n\nAny wages, except vacation moneys accrued\nbefore the period of the employer's violation, paid by the employer to the\nemployee during the period of the employer's violation. Wages are obtained\nusing the same calculation in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. (2)\n\nAny voluntary and unconditional payments\nmade by the employer to the employee that were not required to satisfy any\nlegal obligations and that the employer can demonstrate were made prior to the\nissuance of the commissioner's final determination. Such payments shall be made\nby check or through a previously agreed upon direct deposit arrangement. Payments required pursuant to employee contracts, collective bargaining\nagreements, through other legal obligations, or under law shall not be credited\nagainst liability under this section. Promises to make future payments shall\nnot be credited against liability under this section. (3)\n\nAny payments by the employer to a third\nparty trustee, such as premiums for health benefits or payments to a defined\ncontribution plan, on behalf of and attributable to the employee for the period\nof the violation. (4)\n\nAny liability\npaid by the employer under any applicable federal law governing notification of\nmass layoffs, plant closings, relocations, or covered reductions in work\nhours. (5)\n\nIn an administrative\nproceeding by the commissioner, any liability paid by the employer prior to the\ncommissioner's determination as the result of a private action brought under\nthis Act. (6)\n\nIn a private action\nbrought under this Act, any liability paid by the employer in an administrative\nproceeding by the commissioner prior to the adjudication of such private\naction. (d) Any\nliability incurred by an employer under paragraph (a) of this section with\nrespect to a defined benefit pension plan may be reduced by crediting the\nemployee with service for all purposes under such a plan for the period of the\nviolation. (e) The period of the\nviolation, for which the employer is liable to each employee, begins on the\ndate of the employee's employment loss and continues up to 90 days after the\ndate the employee received notice. Where the employer failed to provide notice, the period of the violation is 90 days. Where the employer claims exemption\nfrom the notice requirements under one of the exceptions provided for in the\n\nAct, the commissioner will consider all information obtained during the\ninvestigation and determine when it would have been practicable for the\nemployer to provide notice, if at all. (f) A violation of the Act may be shared with\nother public entities making fitness, responsible contractor, or due diligence\ninquiries. (g) Payments in lieu of\nnotice of separation or layoff. (1)\n\nAmounts\npaid or payable by an employer to an individual in lieu of notice of separation\nor layoff, except for payments related to an employer's violation of the Act, shall be treated as wages with respect to the period of notice, provided that\nthe following conditions are met: (i) There\nmust be an employment agreement or a uniformly applied company policy that\nrequires that the employing unit give the employee a definite period of notice\nbefore a layoff or separation; and\n(ii)\n\nThe employee must be laid off or\nseparated without the required notice; and\n(iii)\n\nThe employing unit must pay the\nemployee a sum equal to the employee's regular wages and the value of the costs\nof any benefits, or an amount computed in accordance with a formula based on\nthe employee's past earnings and benefits costs, for the required period of the\nnotice. (2)\n\nAmounts paid\nor payable by an employer to an individual in lieu of notice of separation or\nlayoff that do not satisfy the conditions set forth in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision shall be treated as severance pay except for payments that qualify\nas vacation pay in connection with a layoff or separation and are not related\nto an employer's liability for violation of the Act.
