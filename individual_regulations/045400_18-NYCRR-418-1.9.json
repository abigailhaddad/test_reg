  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 418-1.9 - Behavior management\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The program must establish and follow a\nwritten plan for behavior management that is acceptable to the office. This\nplan must include how the staff will approach challenging behaviors, help\nchildren solve problems and encourage acceptable behaviors. (b) The staff must use acceptable techniques\nand approaches to help children solve problems. (c) The program must provide copies of the\nbehavior management plan to all staff and parents of children in care at the\nprogram. (d) Behavior management\nmust promote self-esteem in children and guide children in such a way as to\nhelp each child develop self-control and assume responsibility for his or her\nactions through clear and consistent rules and limits appropriate to the ages\nand development of the children in care. (e) Any discipline used must relate to the\nchild's action and be handled without prolonged delay on the part of the staff\nso that the child is aware of the relationship between his or her actions and\nthe consequences of those actions. (f) Isolating a child in a closet, darkened\narea, or any area where the child cannot be seen and supervised by a teacher is\nprohibited. (g) Where a child's\nbehavior harms or is likely to result in harm to the child, others or property, or seriously disrupts or is likely to seriously disrupt group interaction, the\nchild may be separated briefly from the group, but only for as long as is\nnecessary for the child to regain enough self-control to rejoin the group. The\nchild must be placed in an area where he or she is in the view of, and can be\nsupervised and supported by, a teacher. Interaction between a teacher and the\nchild must take place immediately following the separation to guide the child\ntoward appropriate group behavior. Separation of a child from the group in a\nmanner other than that provided for herein is prohibited. (h) Physical restraint is\nprohibited. Physical restraint is the act of using force to\nextremely limit a child's body movements for a lengthy period of time. It\ninvolves holding a child against his/her will and putting pressure on the\nchild's chest and/or extremities in an effort to significantly restrict his/her\nmovement, thereby making it extremely difficult for a child to move. It may\nalso involve holding a child flat on the ground and restricting his/her body\nfrom movement. (i) Physical intervention is permitted. Physical intervention is the act of using bodily\ncontact as a short-term immediate response to prevent children from incurring\nsubstantial or serious injury to themselves or injuring others. It may involve: picking a child up and moving him or her away from danger or conflict, holding\nthe child's hands or gently touching the body to direct their movement, rocking\na child to soothe them, blocking a child's path when they are about to injure\nthemselves or others or destroy property. This technique allows the child to\nregain self-control as quickly and safely as possible. A consultation with a\nchild's parent is required if the child is not receptive to physical\nintervention. (j) Corporal punishment is prohibited. For the purposes of this Subpart, the term\ncorporal punishment\nmeans punishment inflicted directly on the\nbody including, but not limited to, physical restraint, spanking, biting, shaking, slapping, twisting or squeezing; demanding excessive physical\nexercise, prolonged lack of movement or motion, or strenuous or bizarre\npostures; and compelling a child to eat or have in the child's mouth soap, foods, hot spices or irritants or the like. (k) Withholding or using food, rest or sleep\nas a punishment is prohibited. (l) A child may only be disciplined by a director, group teacher or assistant\nteacher. (m) Methods of discipline, interaction or toilet training which frighten, demean or humiliate a child are\nprohibited. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
