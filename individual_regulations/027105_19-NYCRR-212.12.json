Tit. 19 § 212.12 - Accidental and intentional fouls resulting in injury\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a contest or exhibition of\nprofessional mixed martial arts is stopped because of an accidental foul, the\nreferee, with advice from the ringside physician, shall determine whether the\ncombatant who has been fouled can continue or not. If the contestant's chance\nof winning has not been seriously jeopardized as a result of the foul, the\nreferee may order that the contest or exhibition continue after a recuperative\ninterval of not more than five minutes. Immediately after separating the\ncontestants, the referee shall inform the commission's representative of a\ndetermination that the foul was accidental. (b) If the referee determines that a contest\nor exhibition of professional mixed martial arts may not continue because of an\ninjury suffered as the result of an accidental foul, the contest or exhibition\nshall be declared a no contest if the foul occurs during either of the\nfollowing: (1)\nthe first two rounds of a\nscheduled three-round contest or exhibition; or\n(2)\nthe first three rounds of a scheduled\nfive-round contest or exhibition. (c) If an accidental foul renders a combatant\nunable to continue the contest or exhibition after the completed second round\nof a scheduled three-round contest or exhibition, or after the completed third\nround of a scheduled five-round contest or exhibition, the outcome shall be\ndetermined by scoring the completed rounds and the round during which the\nreferee stops the contest or exhibition. (d) If an injury inflicted by an accidental\nfoul later becomes aggravated by fair blows and the referee orders the contest\nor exhibition stopped because of the injury, the outcome shall be determined by\nscoring the completed rounds and the round during which the referee stops the\ncontest or exhibition. Incomplete rounds should be scored utilizing the same\ncriteria as the scoring of other rounds up to the point said incomplete round\nis stopped. (e) In the event of an\ninjury sustained during competition by a foul that the referee determines to be\nintentional, the following shall take place: (1)\nif the injury results in the immediate\ntermination of the bout, the contestant causing the injury loses by\ndisqualification; (2)\nif the injury\nis evaluated and the bout is allowed to continue thereafter, the referee shall\nnotify the scorekeeper to automatically deduct two points from the contestant\nwho committed the foul; (3)\nif the\ninjury is evaluated and the bout is allowed to continue thereafter, but the\ninjury causes the injured contestant to be unable to continue at a subsequent\npoint in the contest, the injured contestant shall win by technical decision if\nhe or she is ahead on the scorecards at the time the competition is ended due\nto the injury, however, if the injured contestant is even or behind on the\nscore cards, the outcome of the bout shall be declared a technical\ndraw. (f) If an injury\nsustained during competition as a result of a legal maneuver is severe enough\nthat the referee or ringside physician terminates a bout, the injured\ncontestant shall lose by technical knockout. If a contestant injures himself or\nherself while attempting to intentionally foul his or her opponent, the referee\nshall not take any action in his or her favor, and the injury shall be treated\nin the same manner as an injury produced by a fair blow. (g) If a combatant, during a round, loses\ncontrol of a bodily function, i.e., vomits, urinates or\ndefecates, due to a legal blow, the referee shall immediately stop the contest\nor exhibition, and the combatant shall lose by technical knockout (TKO) due to\nmedical stoppage. (h) If a\ncombatant, during a round, loses control of a bodily function due to an\naccidental foul, the referee shall immediately stop the contest or exhibition, and: (1)\nthe contest or exhibition shall be\ndeclared a no contest if the foul occurs during: (i) the first two rounds of a scheduled\nthree-round contest or exhibition; or\n(ii)\nthe first three rounds of a scheduled\nfive-round contest or exhibition; (2)\nthe outcome of the contest or exhibition\nshall be determined by scoring the completed rounds and the round during which\nthe referee stops the contest or exhibition if the foul occurs after: (i) the completed second round of a\nthree-round contest or exhibition; or\n(ii)\nthe completed third round of a\nfive-round contest or exhibition. (i) If a combatant, during a round, loses\ncontrol of a bodily function due to an intentional foul, the referee shall stop\nthe contest or exhibition, and the offending combatant shall lose by\ndisqualification. (j) If a\ncombatant, during the rest period between rounds, loses control of a bodily\nfunction, the ringside physician shall examine the combatant and determine\nhis/her medical fitness to continue competing. If the ringside physician\ndetermines that the combatant is not medically fit to continue, the combatant\nshall lose by technical knockout (TKO) due to medical stoppage. (k) If, at any time during the bout and in\ncircumstances other than those described in subdivisions (g) through (j) of\nthis section, in the determination of the referee, there is a risk that a\ncombatant may come into contact the vomit, urine or fecal matter of an opponent\nwho lost control of a bodily function, the referee shall immediately stop the\ncontest or exhibition, and the opponent who lost control of a bodily function\nshall lose by TKO due to medical stoppage.
