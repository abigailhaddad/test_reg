  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 201-6.2 - Permit Applications\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Timely\napplication'. The owner or operator of a facility subject to this Subpart shall\nsubmit a complete application, as defined in Part 621 of this Title and this\n\nSubpart, for initial issuance of a title V permit, or renewal, in accordance\nwith the timeframes established under paragraphs (1) through (6) of this\nsubdivision: (1)\n\nPrior to the commencement of\nconstruction of a new facility subject to permitting under this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n\nPrior to the\ncommencement of construction of new emission unit(s) or modified emission units\nat an existing facility that makes the facility subject to title V permitting. The owner or operator of a facility subject to this provision may choose to\napply for a State facility permit pursuant to section\n201-5.2\nof this Part. Upon\nissuance, that permit shall authorize both construction and operation of the\nnew or modified emission units until a title V permit is issued in accordance\nwith this Subpart. An application for a title V permit is required within one\nyear of the commencement of operation of the new or modified emission unit(s). (3)\n\nPrior to the commencement of\nconstruction of a new emission unit at an existing title V facility. The owner\nor operator of an existing title V facility, which is being modified by the\naddition of a new emission unit comprised solely of new emission sources, may\napply for a State facility permit pursuant to section\n201-5.2\nof this Part that will\nauthorize construction and operation of the new emission unit upon issuance. An\napplication for a title V permit modification is required within one year of\nthe commencement of operation of the new emission unit. (4)\n\nAt least 180 days, but not more than\neighteen months, prior to the date of permit expiration for permit renewal\npurposes. (5)\n\nFor existing\nfacilities required to meet the requirements under section 112(g) of the act, prior to construction. (6)\n\nFor\nexisting facilities with any emission source designated by EPA as requiring a\ntitle V facility permit, within 12 months after the effective date of EPA's\ndesignation, or by a later deadline specified by EPA in its\ndesignation. (b) 'Completeness determinations'. (1)\n\nApplications submitted for title V facility permits must be reviewed for\ncompleteness by the department in accordance with subdivision (d) of this\nsection and Part 621 of this Title. (2)\n\nAny applicant who fails to submit any\nrelevant facts or who has submitted incorrect information in a permit\napplication shall, upon becoming aware of such failure or incorrect submittal, promptly submit such supplementary facts or corrected information. In addition, the applicant shall provide additional information as necessary to address any\nrequirements that become applicable to the facility after the date it filed a\ncomplete application but prior to release of a draft permit. (3)\n\nIf a facility owner or operator submits a\ntimely and complete application for title V permit issuance and/or renewal, the\nfailure to have a title V facility permit is not a violation of this Part\nbecause the department has not taken final action on the permit application, except as noted in this section. This protection shall cease to apply if, subsequent to the completeness determination, the applicant fails to submit, by\na reasonable deadline specified in writing by the department, any additional\ninformation identified as being needed to review and act on the application. The department will reinstate this protection upon receipt of the additional\ninformation in the event that an applicant is unable to provide it within the\nspecified timeframe. (c) 'Final decisions'. The department shall act on title V facility permit\napplications in accordance with the timeframes and procedures established in\n\nPart 621 of this Title. Failure to act on new title V facility permit\napplications within 18 months of receipt of a complete application shall be\ngrounds for judicial review in State court. (d) 'Application Content'. All title V\nfacility permit applications submitted to the department shall be signed by a\nresponsible official and provided in a format acceptable to the department. Title V facility permit applications must include the following information at\na minimum: (1)\n\nIdentifying information, including company name and address (or facility name and address if different\nfrom the company name), owner's name and representative, and telephone number\nand names of the facility manager/contact. (2)\nA description of the facility's processes\nand products (by Standard Industrial Classification or North American Industry\n\nClassification System code) including any associated with each alternate\noperating scenario identified by the owner or operator. (3)\n\nThe following emissions-related\ninformation: (i) All emissions of pollutants\nfor which the facility is major, all emissions of regulated air pollutants, and\nall emissions of high toxicity air contaminants listed in Table 1 of Subpart\n201-9 of this Part. The permit application shall describe all emissions of\nregulated air pollutants emitted from any emissions unit, emission point and\nprocess, except where such units are listed as exempt or trivial under Subpart\n201-3 o f this Part. The applicant shall submit additional information related\nto the emissions of regulated air pollutants sufficient to verify which Federal\nrequirements are applicable to the facility. (ii)\n\nFugitive emissions from a major facility\nshall be included in the permit application in the same manner as stack\nemissions, regardless of whether the source category in question is included in\nthe definition of major facility. Source categories that must include fugitive\nemissions in the applicability determination for title V facility permits are\nidentified within the definition of major facility. (iii)\n\nIdentification and description of all\nemission units described in the above paragraphs in sufficient detail to\nestablish the applicability of Federal requirements. (iv)\n\nEmissions rates of all regulated air\npollutants in such terms as are necessary to establish compliance consistent\nwith the applicable standard reference test method. (v) The following information to the extent\nit is needed to determine or regulate emissions in accordance with applicable\nrequirements: Fuel types and their usage, raw materials, production rates, and\noperating schedules. (vi)\n\nIdentification and description of air pollution control equipment and\ncompliance monitoring devices or activities required under the Clean Air\n\nAct.

(4)\n\nThe following air pollution control\nrequirements: (i) Citation and description of\nall applicable requirements. (ii)\n\nDescription of or reference to any applicable test method for determining\ncompliance with each applicable requirement. (5)\n\nOther specific information that may be\nnecessary to implement and enforce other requirements of the act or to\ndetermine the applicability of such requirements.
