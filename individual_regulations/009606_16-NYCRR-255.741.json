Tit. 16 § 255.741 - Pressure-limiting and -regulating stations: telemetering or recording gauges\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\ndistribution system supplied by more than one district pressure-regulating\nstation must be equipped with telemetering or recording pressure gauges to\nindicate the gas pressure in the district. (b) On distribution systems supplied by a\nsingle district pressure-regulating station, the operator shall determine the\nnecessity of installing telemetering or recording gauges in the district, taking into consideration the number of customers supplied, the operating\npressures, the capacity of the installation, and other operating\nconditions. (c) For low-pressure\ndistribution systems, the telemetering or recording pressure gauges are to be\nlocated at, or near each district regulator outlet and the probable locations\nof minimum pressures in each part of the system. (d) The accuracy of each recording pressure\ngauge provided and maintained by each operator at the locations required herein\nshall be tested at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each\ncalendar year. The results of the tests shall be recorded. (e) Each chart removed from a recording\npressure gauge shall be reviewed for indications of abnormally high or low\npressure. If there are indications of abnormally high or low pressure, the\nregulator and the auxiliary equipment must be inspected and the necessary\nmeasures taken to correct any unsatisfactory operating conditions. (f) Each chart removed from a recording\npressure gauge shall be marked with the name of the operator, the location of\nthe gauge, the date that it was placed upon the gauge, and the date that it was\nremoved from the gauge prior to its filing.
