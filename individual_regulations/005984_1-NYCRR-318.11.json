  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 318.11 - Canning with heat processing and hermetically sealed containers; cleaning containers; closure; code marking; heat processing; incubation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Containers\nwhich are intended to be hermetically sealed shall be cleaned thoroughly\nimmediately before filling, and precaution must be taken to avoid soiling the\ninner surfaces subsequently. However, cans in which lard is to be hermetically\nsealed may be examined immediately before filling and if found to be acceptably\nclean by a department employee need not be washed. (b) Containers of metal, glass, or other\nmaterial shall be washed in an inverted position with a water spray. The nozzle\non the spray attachment shall be of such design and the water delivered with\nsuch pressure as will effectively rinse all of the inner surface of each\ncontainer. Such containers shall not contain an accumulation of water when\nreceived at the filling station. In lieu of cleaning with water, the use of\nefficient jet-vacuum type equipment for cleaning containers is permitted, immediately prior to filling. (c) Nothing less than perfect closure is acceptable for hermetically sealed\ncontainers. Heat processing shall follow promptly after closing. (d) Careful inspection shall be made of the\ncontainers by competent establishment employees immediately after closing, and\ncontainers which are defectively filled or defectively closed or show\ninadequate vacuum shall not be processed until the defect has been corrected. The containers shall again be inspected by establishment employees when they\nhave cooled sufficiently for handling after processing by heating. The contents\nof defective containers shall be condemned unless correction of the defect is\naccomplished within six hours following the sealing of the containers or\ncompletion of the heat processing, as the case may be, except that: (1)\nif the defective condition is discovered\nduring an afternoon run, the cans of product may be held in coolers at a\ntemperature not exceeding 38 degrees Fahrenheit under conditions that will\npromptly and effectively chill them until the following day when the defect may\nbe corrected; (2)\nshort vacuum or\noverstuffed cans of product which have not been handled in accordance with\nparagraph (1) may be incubated under department supervision, after which the\ncans shall be opened and the sound product passed for food; and\n(3)\nshort vacuum or overstuffed cans of\nproduct of a class required to be labeled \"Perishable, Keep Under\n\nRefrigeration\" and which have been kept under adequate refrigeration since\nprocessing may be opened and the sound product passed for food. (e) Canned products shall not be\npassed unless after cooling to atmospheric temperature, they show the external\ncharacteristics of sound cans, that is, the cans shall not be overfilled; they\nshall have concave sides, excepting the seam side, and all ends shall be\nconcave; there shall be no bulging; the sides and ends shall conform to the\nproduct; and there shall be no slack or loose tin. (f) All canned products shall be plainly and\npermanently marked on the containers by code or otherwise with the identity of\nthe contents and date of canning. The code used and its meaning shall be on\nrecord in the office of the inspector in charge. If calendar dating is used, it\nmust be accompanied by an explanatory statement, as provided in section\n317.8\n(b)(32)(ii)\nof this Article. (g) Canned product\nmust be processed at such temperature and for such period of time as will\nassure keeping without refrigeration under usual conditions of storage and\ntransportation when heating is relied on for preservation, with the exception\nof those canned product which are processed without steam-pressure cooking by\npermission of the commissioner in specific cases and labeled \"Perishable, Keep\n\nUnder Refrigeration\". (h) Lots of\ncanned product shall be identified during their handling preparatory to heat\nprocessing by tagging the baskets, cages, or cans with a tag which will change\ncolor on going through the heat processing or by other effective means so as to\npositively preclude failure to heat process after closing. (i) Facilities shall be provided by the\noperator of the official establishment for incubation of representative samples\nof fully processed canned product. The incubation shall consist of holding the\ncanned product for the periods of time and at the temperatures prescribed in\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision. (1)\n\nIncubation test shall be made to the extent required by the officer in charge. The extent to which incubation tests shall be required depends on conditions\nsuch as the record of the official establishment in conducting canning\noperations, the extent to which the establishment furnishes competent\nsupervision and inspection in connection with the canning operations, the\ncharacter of the equipment used, and the degree to which such equipment is\nmaintained at maximum efficiency. Such factors shall be considered by the\nofficer in charge in determining the extent of incubation testing at a\nparticular establishment. (2)\n\nIn\nthe event of failure by an official establishment to provide suitable\nfacilities for incubation of test samples, the officer in charge may require\nholding of the entire lot under such conditions and for such period of time as\nmay, in his discretion, be necessary to establish the stability of the\nproduct. (3)\n\nThe officer in charge\nmay permit lots of canned product to be shipped from the official establishment\nprior to completion of sample incubation when he has no reason to suspect\nunsoundness in the particular lots, and under circumstances which will assure\nthe return of the product to the establishment for reinspection should such\naction be indicated by the incubation results. (4)\n\nIncubation shall consist of holding the\nsamples at 95 degrees (+-2° F.) for no less than 10 days; except\n(i) Samples of firmly packed products such as\nluncheon meat, and products with high fat content, such as chorizos packed in\nlard, and products weighing three pounds or more shall be held at 95 degrees\n(+-2° F.) for no less than 20 days. (ii)\n\nSamples of products composed of chunks\nor patties of meat in a medium or sauce wherein the pH of the meat component\nand the medium or sauce are significantly different shall be incubated at 95\ndegrees (+-2° F.) for no less than 30 days.
