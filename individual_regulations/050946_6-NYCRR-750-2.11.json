  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 750-2.11 - Closure requirements for disposal systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section applies to any and all\ndisposal systems permanently removed from use or operation at SPDES permitted\nfacilities or at facilities for which a SPDES permit has been revoked or an\napplication for renewal denied, unless a judicial or administrative stay is in\neffect. The intent of this section is to protect public safety and health and\nto assure that no contamination of ground or surface water will occur as a\nresult of removing such systems from service either through the act of closure\nor through continuing the discharge of pollutants into or through equipment; or\nthrough leaking, leaching, or discharge of pollutants from wastewater or\nresiduals remaining in disposal systems which has been removed from use but\nremains on site. (b) The\nclosure of a disposal system\nmeans either the termination of\nthe source of wastewater or storm water, or the permitted conveyance of\nwastewater or storm water to an alternate location (such as a regional\nfacility) in such a manner that no further treatment storage or conveyance of\nwastewater or storm water is performed by the system. (c) Disposal system closures shall conform\nwith the following procedures: (1)\n\nOn or\nbefore 60 calendar days prior to taking the system out of service a permittee\nshall: (i) submit to the regional water\nengineer the following information concerning closure activities: (a) the date the system will cease\noperation; (b) the date the\ninfluent and effluent pipes will be sealed; (c) plans (signed and sealed by a New York\n\nState licensed professional engineer) for final disposition of the physical\nfacilities, including all treatment units, outfall line, and all mechanical and\nelectrical equipment and piping; (d) plans (signed and sealed by a New York\n\nState licensed professional engineer) for elimination of all equipment and/or\nconditions that could possibly pose a safety hazard, either during or after\nshut-down of operations; (e) verification that there are no lines in the collection system which are cross\nconnected (receiving both sanitary and storm water) or which do not contain\nadequate conveyance capacity; (f) the name of the licensed individual responsible for the maintenance and\noperation of the wastewater pumping station and/or disposal system systems that\nare still to be maintained; and\n(ii)\nnotify the regional water engineer, in\nwriting, concerning any deactivated lagoons or other actual or potential\ndischarges to ground water which may exist at the site. (2)\n\nProper management and/or removal of all\nresidual materials (collected grit and screenings, scums, sand bed material, and dried or liquid sludges), as well as filter media, and all other solids\nfrom the treatment process that may remain in the abandoned treatment works is\nrequired. (i) The permittee shall submit to\nthe regional water engineer proof of ownership of or contractual arrangement\nwith an operation or operations permitted to manage all such waste materials. A\ncontract with a hauler will only be accepted as proof of proper waste\nmanagement if documentation of management at an approved site or sites is\nincluded. In addition, all necessary State or Federal permits/approvals must\naccompany the submission. (ii)\n\nAll\nresidual material shall be removed within 180 calendar days after the system is\ntaken out of service. Proof of proper residuals management shall be submitted\nto the regional water engineer within 30 calendar days after their removal. The\ndates of removal and quantities removed shall be specified. (d) Upon satisfaction\nof closure requirements specified in subdivision (c) of this section, the\nregional water engineer shall be contacted, in writing, to schedule a final\nsite inspection of any disposal system which had a SPDES discharge permit to\nverify that influent and effluent pipes have been sealed and that all solid and\nresidual materials related to the treatment process have been\nremoved.
