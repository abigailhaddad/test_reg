Wipe cleaning\nis not included in this definition. (2)\n'Conveyorized degreasing.' Continuous\nprocess of solvent cleaning by operating with either cold or vaporized\nsolvents. (3)\n'Degreaser.' Any\nsolvent cleaning machine used to perform cold cleaning degreasing, remote\nreservoir degreasing, conveyorized degreasing, or open top vapor\ndegreasing. (4)\n'Freeboard height.'\nDistance from the top of the vapor zone to the top of the degreaser tank. On\ncold cleaners, it is the distance from liquid level to lip of tank. (5)\n'Freeboard ratio.' Freeboard height\ndivided by the interior width of the degreaser tank. (6)\n'Open top vapor degreasing.' Process of\nsolvent cleaning by condensing hot solvent vapor on the colder parts. (7)\n'Remote reservoir degreasing.' Cold\ncleaning degreasing performed in a device in which liquid solvent is pumped to\na sink like work area, where the parts are cleaned, and then drains back into\nan enclosed container allowing no solvent to pool in the work area. (8)\n'Solvent cleaning.' Process of cleaning\nsoils from surfaces by using a volatile organic compound (VOC). (9)\n'Special and extreme solvent cleaning.'\nThe use of degreasers: (i) to clean parts in\nthe manufacturing and rework of electronic parts, assemblies, boxes, wiring\nharnesses, sensors and connectors used in aerospace service; (ii)\nto clean parts used in the manufacturing\nof ozone, nitrous oxide, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, halogenated compounds, or\noxygen in concentrations greater than 23 percent; or\n(iii)\nto clean parts exposed to ozone, nitrous oxide, fluorine, chlorine, bromine, halogenated compounds, or oxygen in\nconcentrations greater than 23 percent.
