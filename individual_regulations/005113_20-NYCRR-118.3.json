  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 118.3 - Modifications for certain gains excluded from Federal distributable net income\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 618(2)\n(a) In determining the New York taxable\nincome of a resident estate or trust, Federal taxable income is reduced by the\namount of the modifications described in subdivisions (d) and (e) of section\n112.3\nof this Article, but only with respect to gains (from the sale or other\ndisposition of property) which are excluded from Federal distributable net\nincome of the estate or trust. With respect to gains which are includible in\n\nFederal distributable net income, any applicable modifications are reflected in\nthe New York fiduciary adjustment (see sections\n118.4\nof this Part and Part 119 of this Article). (b) The modifications provided by section\n112.3\n(d) of this Article reduce, to the extent applicable, the gains reported by the\nestate or trust for Federal income tax purposes from the sale or other\ndisposition of property having a higher New York State basis (on the last\neffective date of article 16 of the Tax Law) than the Federal basis on that\ndate. The modifications provided by section\n112.3\n(e) of this Article exclude any item of income or gain currently reported by the\nestate or trust for Federal income tax purposes which was taxed by New York\n\nState in a previous year under article 16 of the Tax Law. See subdivisions (d)\nand (e) of section\n112.3\nfor a general discussion of these modifications as they apply to items of\nincome or gain received directly by resident individuals. (c) The following discussion in this section\ncovers the application of these modifications in the case of estates and\ntrusts. (1)\n\nComputation of the amount of\nmodifications for different Federal and New York State bases. Where the sale or other disposition of a particular asset\nresults in a gain which is taxable in total to the estate or trust, the gain is\nsubject to a modification under section\n112.3\n(d) of this Article if the property sold had a higher New York State income tax\nbasis on the last day of the last year taxable under article 16 of the Tax Law\nthan the Federal basis on such date. The amount to be subtracted from Federal\ntaxable income is the portion of the gain reported for Federal income tax\npurposes which is not in excess of the difference between the two bases, except\nthat if the gain is considered a long-term capital gain for Federal income tax\npurposes, the modification is limited to 40 percent of such portion of the gain\n(60 percent for taxable years beginning in 1972 and before 1982; 50 percent for\ntaxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1972). The application of section\n112.3\n(d) of this Article to such a gain by an estate is shown in the following\nexample: Example: A testamentary trust created by a decedent contained\nstock which had a fair market value of $100,000 on July 1, 1958, the date of\nthe decedent's death, and the stock was valued at this amount for New York\n\nState estate tax purposes. One year later the fair market value was $90,000, and the executor/trustee elected to use the lower value for Federal estate tax\npurposes. In 1985 the executor/trustee for the testamentary trust of the\ndecedent sold the stock for $104,000, realizing a gain of $14,000 for Federal\nincome tax purposes. In accordance with the terms of the will, this gain was\nallocated to the corpus of the estate, so that it is excluded from\ndistributable net income for Federal income tax purposes, and is taxable to the\nestate. Since it is a long-term capital gain, only 40 percent thereof is\nincluded in the estate's Federal taxable income. The difference between the higher New York State basis\nand the Federal basis is $10,000 ($100,000 minus $90,000), so that the portion\nof the gain not in excess of the difference in basis is also $10,000. However, since this is a long-term capital gain, the modification is limited to $4,000, 40 percent of the difference in basis and it is this amount which should be\nsubtracted from the estate's Federal taxable income in determining its New York\ntaxable income. Note: If the sale of this stock by the executor and the\nresulting long-term capital gain had occurred in a taxable year beginning in\n1972 and before 1982, the modification to be subtracted from Federal taxable\nincome would be 60 percent of the difference in basis, or $6,000. If the sale\nof the stock by the executor and the resulting long-term capital gain had\noccurred in a taxable year beginning prior to 1972, the modification to be\nsubtracted from Federal taxable income would be 50 percent of the difference in\nbasis, or $5,000. (2)\n\nModification for gains previously taxed under article 16 of the Tax Law. These modifications are allowed in order to prevent a\ngain from being taxed under article 22 of the Tax Law, where the same gain was\npreviously taxed under article 16 of the Tax Law either to the estate or trust, or to a decedent by reason of whose death the estate or trust acquired the\nright to receive the gain, or to another estate or trust from which the subject\nestate or trust received the gain. Example: On July 1, 1956, a resident individual, C, who filed his\n\nFederal and New York State personal income tax returns on a calendar year\nbasis, sold certain real property, realizing a short-term capital gain of\n$6,000. He elected to report the gain on the installment method for both\n\nFederal and New York State personal income tax purposes. By reason of this\nelection $1,000 of this gain was reportable on the 1956 calendar year Federal\nincome tax return of C, and thereafter on each Federal income tax return for\nthe succeeding five years, as the annual installment payments on July first\neach year were received. C died on April 30, 1959. In accordance with the\napplicable provisions of article 16 of the Tax Law then in force, C's executor\nincluded the entire amount of the previously unreportable gain ($3,000) in C's\n\nNew York State personal income tax return for the period ending with his death; that is, from January 1 to April 30, 1959. C's executor properly reported\n$1,000 of such gain as income in respect of a decedent in each of the Federal\nincome tax returns of the estate for 1959 and 1960. The $1,000 properly\nreported on the Federal income tax return is automatically reflected in the New\n\nYork State personal income tax return for 1960, since the New York taxable\nincome of a resident estate or trust is the same as the Federal taxable income, with certain modifications. Since the $1,000 was previously included in the\ngain properly reported in C's New York State personal income tax return for the\nperiod ending with his death in 1959, a modification reducing the estate's New\n\nYork taxable income by $1,000 is allowed for 1960. (The same modification would\nbe applicable for 1961 if the remaining $1,000 gain is properly included in the\nestate's Federal taxable income for 1961.) In this example, all of the capital\ngain is allocable to principal for estate accounting purposes and is thus\ntaxable to the estate. No portion of the gain is therefore includible in the\nestate's Federal distributable net income, and no part of the above\nmodification enters into the computation of the New York fiduciary adjustment. Accordingly, the entire amount of the modification is subtracted by C's\nexecutor from the estate's Federal taxable income in order to properly compute\nthe New York taxable income of the estate.
