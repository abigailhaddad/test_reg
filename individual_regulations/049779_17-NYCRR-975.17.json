  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 975.17 - Determination of maximum operating assistance for private bus operators\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn accordance with legislation, the commissioner will\nannually establish a maximum service payment limit for each private bus\noperator that reflects a reasonable return on equity or operating expenses and\nrevenues. In establishing, the maximum service payment limit, consideration may\nbe given to prior years as well as the current fiscal year's return on equity\nor operating revenues and expenses. Additional criteria are also specified\nbelow regarding the profit provided to private operators that are part of a\nsystem where the local government provides local government funds in excess of\nmandated levels to further improve the utility, effectiveness, and/or\ncoordination of its system of services. All private transit operator financial records must conform\nto the uniform system of accounts, and their Annual Report to the Commissioner\nmust be consistent with the uniform system of accounts as identified in section\n975.5. Annually, the Department\nwill evaluate the financial position of each private operator and establish a\nmaximum service payment limit (cap) pursuant to the guidelines established by\nthe Department's Carrier Certification and Compliance Bureau by regulatory\nprocess (profit cap case). Financial data not conforming to these regulatory\ncase guidelines will be adjusted by the Department and may result in a lower\npayment limit. The annual limit established for one year may be used in\nthe following year until a new limit is established based on the previous\nyear's actual data. The Department may amend an established annual maximum\nservice payment limit when circumstances that will substantially change\nestimated expenses and revenues (such as a fare increase) warrant such an\nupdating. Any public transportation system that proposes to\ndistribute, or has been found to have distributed, to any individual private\nbus operator (or for all operators in the system where the requirements of\nsection\n975.15\n(3)\nregarding profit cap on a system level have been met) a total amount of\noperating assistance that would exceed, or has exceeded, its individual maximum\noperating assistance allowance, as determined by the current regulatory case\nissued by the Department, and which seeks to allow such profits to be retained\nby the operator and not result in reduced State transit operating assistance\npayments to the public transportation system, shall comply with the following\nrequirements: (a) Submit a report that\ndescribes the methodology employed by the sponsor to allocate operating\nexpenses for STOA eligible services, and includes an explanation of the\nrationale for making an adjustment to any category of expense that is\ninconsistent with any determination made by the Department in the final profit\ncap case for those operators that they propose to provide a profit in excess of\nthe established statewide standard. Such report shall also include an\nexplanation and reconciliation of any differences in expenses, revenues, and\nsubsidies shown on any other financial report submitted to the Department by\nthe sponsor to fulfill STOA program reporting requirements (ex. the annual\nestimates and projections prepared pursuant to section\n17-a\nof the\n\nTransportation Law and annual appropriation language). (b) Demonstrate that the amount of local\nvoluntary aid is at least equal to the profit paid to private bus operators\nthat is in excess of the operator's maximum operating assistance allowance as\ncalculated by the Department. (c) Demonstrate that the individual private bus operator(s) is more economic than\nprovision of service of comparable quality and quantity by a comparable public\nauthority or public municipal system. Operator cost per revenue vehicle hour is\nan acceptable comparable measure. The Department will assist in providing data\non comparable public systems, if requested. (d) Certify that the profit level being\nprovided has been reviewed and is reasonable, consistent with maintaining\nadequate service to the public. The certification must be made by the chief executive\nofficer of the public transportation system. The public transportation system\nmust indicate its intent in writing to make a submission under this provision\nnot later than 45 days after the issuance of the final profit cap case in order\nto avoid recovery of state aid equal to the amount of profits in excess of the\nprofit standard established by the Department. The deadline for submission of the documentation specified\nabove shall be 60 days from the date of issuance of the final profit cap case\nby the Department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
