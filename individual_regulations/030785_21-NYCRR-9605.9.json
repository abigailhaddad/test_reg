(1)\n\nThe authority will apply the following\nprocedures when bidding a construction contract which contains items suitable\nfor subcontracting: (i) include in the\ninformation to bidders and in all construction contracts, the provisions for\nLBE and GLBE subcontracting; (ii)\nprepare a bid notice to be published in the City Record and sent to appropriate\ntrade publications and trade associations indicating that the project contains\nitems suitable for subcontracting to LBEs/GLBEs; (iii)\nsupply a list of LBEs/GLBEs certified\nby the authority with all bid documents; (iv)\npost, at the location where bid\nmaterials are available, all bid notices; (v) upon request, provide to LBEs/GLBEs a\nlist of prime contractors who pick up bid documents for projects containing\nitems suitable for subcontracting; and\n(vi)\nemphasize the LBE/GLBE program in its\nagenda for pre-bid and pre-construction conference. (b) Pre-award requirements. (1)\n\nThe authority shall seek to ensure that\nif any portion of a construction contract is subcontracted, that not less than\n10 percent of the total dollar amount of the contract or the total\nsubcontracted dollars (whichever is less) are awarded to LBEs/GLBEs through\nimplementation of monitoring activities outlined below: (i) Within five business days following\nnotification of intent to award, the selected contractor shall submit the\ndollar amount and type of work to be subcontracted and a LBE participation\nschedule to the authority. If the schedule does not identify sufficient LBE\nsubcontractors to meet the requirements, the apparent low bidder shall also\nsubmit documentation of its good faith efforts to meet such requirements. (a) The LBE participation schedule shall\ninclude: (1)\nthe name and address of each LBE\nthat will be awarded a subcontract; (2)\nthe percentage dollar amount and type of\nwork to be subcontracted to each LBE; and\n(3)\nthe dates when the LBE subcontract work\nwill commence and end. (b) The following documents shall be attached\nto the LBE participation schedule: (1)\nverification letter from each LBE subcontractor listed stating the terms of its\nformal agreement with the contractor; and\n(2)\ncertification documents of any proposed\nLBE subcontractor which is not on the authority's certified list. (c) Documentation of good faith\nefforts to achieve the required LBE percentage shall include: (1)\nwritten notification by certified mail to\nauthority certified LBEs soliciting bids for specific work items specifying\nestimated value; (2)\nwritten\nnotification to NYC certified LBEs soliciting bids for specific work items\nspecifying estimated value; (3)\nwritten notification to minority and women contractor associations soliciting\nLBE subcontractors; (4)\ndemonstration of efforts made to select portions of the work for performance by\nLBE firms in order to increase the likelihood of achieving the stated\ngoals; (5)\ndocumented efforts to\nnegotiate with LBE firms for specific subcontracts including at a minimum: (i) the names, addresses and telephone\nnumbers of LBE firms contacted; (ii)\ncopies of information provided to LBE\nfirms regarding the plan and specification for portions of the work to be\nperformed; (iii)\ndocumentation\nshowing that no reasonable price could be obtained from LBE firms; and\n(iv)\na statement of why\nagreements with LBE firms were not reached; (6)\na statement of the reason for rejecting\nany LBE firm which the contractor deemed to be unqualified. (ii)\n\nFailure of the\napparent low bidder to provide the information required within the allotted\ntime shall render the bid nonresponsive and therefore, the contract may not be\nawarded to the bidder. (iii)\n\nThe\nauthority shall incorporate into all information provided to bidders on\nconstruction contracts subject to this Part the provisions contained in items\n(i)(c) (5)(i) and (ii) of this paragraph. (c) Post award requirements/contract\nlanguage. (1)\n\nThis contract is subject to the\nrequirements of Administrative Code, section 6-108.1; article 8, title 6, section 1743.2 of the Public Authorities Law as amended and the regulations\npromulgated thereunder. No contract shall be executed unless and until these\nrequirements have been complied with. (2)\n\nUnless specifically waived by the\nauthority, if any portion of the contract is subcontracted, not less than 10\npercent of the total dollar amount of the contract shall be awarded to locally\nbased enterprises or graduate locally based enterprises; except that where less\nthan 10 percent of the total dollar amount of the contract is subcontracted, such less percentage shall be so awarded. (3)\n\nIf the contractor has not met its\nrequired LBE/GLBE percentage prior to award, the contractor shall submit\ndocumentation of its good faith efforts as prescribed in clause (b)(1)(i)(c) of\nthis section for each proposed subcontract prior to the authority's approval of\naward of such proposed subcontract until the contractor meets the required\npercentage. (4)\n\nIf the contractor\nindicates prior to award that no work will be subcontracted, then no work shall\nbe subcontracted without the prior approval of the authority, which shall be\ngranted only if the contractor makes a good faith effort to obtain LBE/GLBE\nsubcontractors at least four weeks before the work is to be\nperformed. (5)\n\nPrime contractors\nmay not require performance and payment bonds from LBE or GLBE\nsubcontractors. (6)\nLBE/GLBE\nparticipation shall be determined and applied toward meeting the 10 percent\nrequirement on the basis of work actually performed in the following manner: (i) The total dollar value of a subcontract\nlet to an LBE/GLBE subcontractor shall be applied toward the contractor's LBE\nrequirement. However, work further subcontracted by an LBE/GLBE subcontractor\nto a non-LBE/GLBE subcontractor shall not be so applied. (7)\n\nThe contractor shall make prompt payment\nto all LBE subcontractors. Within 15 calendar days of receipt of any payment\nfrom the authority, the contractor shall pay each LBE subcontractor the portion\nof the payment from the authority representing the value of the work performed\nby the LBE subcontractor less an amount equivalent to the appropriate pro rata\nshare of the percentage of the retention withheld by the authority from the\ncontractor. (8)\n\nThe contractor is\nstrictly prohibited from withholding payment from an LBE subcontractor due to\ncontract disputes relating to work performed under another unrelated\nsubcontract. (9)\n\nThe contractor is\nstrictly prohibited from requesting or requiring an LBE subcontractor to\nperform work on a change order not approved by the authority and not covered\nunder the LBE's original subcontract. (10)\n\nThe contractor must notify the authority\nprior to withholding payment from an LBE subcontractor for work which the\nauthority has paid the contractor. (11)\n\nThe contractor shall submit to the\nauthority with each requisition for payment, a report of payments to LBE/GLBE\nsubcontractors. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
