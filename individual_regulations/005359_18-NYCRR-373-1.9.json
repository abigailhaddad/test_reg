(2)\n\nThe conciliation procedure must provide\nfor at least one contact between the recipient, appropriate social services\nstaff and the mediator. The process may last no longer than 30 days unless\nmutually agreed to by the social services district and the recipient. (3)\n\nThe social services district must enter\ninto an agreement with an independent entity or must employ trained social\nservices district staff who have no direct responsibility for the recipient's\ncase to act as mediators for such disputes. (4)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision, the social services district may designate\nother staff who are not specifically trained to mediate disputes if no\nindependent entity or trained staff are available. Such staff must have no\ndirect responsibility for the recipient's case and such designation must be\nsubmitted to the local commissioner in writing. (b) Conciliation procedure. (1)\nA social services district must issue a\nnotice to each recipient of RCA who refuses or fails to comply with the\nrequirements of this Subpart. Such notice must be issued as soon as possible, but no later than 10 days following the date of failure or refusal to\nparticipate. The notice must advise the recipient of his or her refusal or\nfailure to comply and that he or she has seven days to request conciliation\nwith the social services district regarding any dispute related to such refusal\nor failure to comply. (2)\n\nIf the\nrecipient requests conciliation, it will be the recipient's responsibility to\nprovide reasons for such refusal or failure to comply. (3)\n\nIf the district and the recipient cannot, with the assistance of the mediator, resolve the issues related to the\nrecipient's refusal or failure to comply, a written document summarizing the\nconciliation and notifying the recipient that he or she has the right to a fair\nhearing pursuant to Part 358 of this Title must be given or sent to the\nrecipient by the district within 10 days of the termination of conciliation. The social services district must incorporate such document into the\nrecipient's case record and, in the event of a fair hearing, present it as\nrequired in accordance with section\n358-4.3\nof this Title. If the\ndistrict determined that the refusal or failure to comply was willful and\nwithout good cause, then the social services district must sanction the\nrecipient pursuant to section\n373-1.8\n(f) of\nthis Subpart. (4)\n\nIf the dispute is\nresolved to the satisfaction of the recipient and the district through the\nconciliation process, a written document memorializing such resolution must be\nsent to the social services district and the recipient within 10 days of such\nresolution. Such resolution is binding on the social services district and the\nrecipient. (5)\n\nIf the recipient\ndoes not respond to the seven day conciliation letter issued by the social\nservices district pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, or if the\nsocial services district determines that the recipient's refusal or failure to\ncomply was willful and without good cause, then the social services district\nmust issue an adequate notice to deny RCA or a timely and adequate notice of\nintent to discontinue or reduce RCA pursuant to section\n373-1.8\n(f) of\nthis Subpart.
