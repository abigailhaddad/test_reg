  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 415.3 - Reimbursements\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 289-c(3), (7)\n(a) Motor fuel consumed other than upon\nthe highways and waterways of New York State. (1)\n\nAny purchaser of motor fuel on which the\nmotor fuel tax imposed by article 12-A of the Tax Law has been paid who\nconsumes such fuel in any manner other than: (i) in the operation of a motor vehicle (as\ndefined in section\n410.2\n[d]\nof this Title) on the highways (as defined in subdivision [l] of such section)\nof New York State; or\n(ii)\nin the\noperation of a pleasure or recreational motorboat on the waterways of New York\n\nState, including waterways bordering on the State, may, upon timely\napplication, be reimbursed the amount of such tax paid. Provided, however, there is no reimbursement pursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law of tax paid\non motor fuel taken out of this State in the fuel tank connected with the\nengine of a motor vehicle and consumed in the operation thereof outside of New\n\nYork State. Persons subject to the additional tax on highway use imposed by\nsection\n503-a\nof the Tax Law may be entitled to\ncertain refunds and credits. (See Article 3 of Subchapter H of this\n\nTitle.)\n(2)\nA person\nclaiming a reimbursement under this subdivision must explain the manner in\nwhich the motor fuel was consumed other than as described in subparagraphs (1)\n(i) and (ii) of this subdivision. (b) Motor fuel consumed by omnibus\ncarriers and taxicab licensees. Any omnibus carrier or taxicab licensee (as defined in\nsubdivisions [m] and [n], respectively, of section\n410.2\nof\nthis Title) which purchases motor fuel on which the aggregate tax imposed by\nsection 284 (four cents per gallon) and section 284-a (three cents per gallon)\nof the Tax Law has been paid, may, upon timely application, be reimbursed the\namount paid pursuant to such sections in excess of four cents per gallon. Accordingly, such reimbursements are limited to three cents per each gallon of\nmotor fuel. Provided further, such reimbursements are allowable only with\nrespect to motor fuel consumed by the carrier in the operation of an omnibus in\n\nNew York State or motor fuel consumed by the licensee in the operation of\ntaxicabs in New York State. (c) Motor fuel consumed in local\ntransit service by omnibus carriers. (1)\n\nIn lieu of the partial reimbursement\ndescribed in subdivision (b) of this section, any omnibus carrier which\npurchases motor fuel on which the aggregate tax imposed by section 284 (four\ncents per gallon), section 284-a (three cents per gallon) and section 284-c\n(one cent per gallon) of the Tax Law has been paid, may, upon timely\napplication, be reimbursed the full amount paid pursuant to such sections in\nrespect of such motor fuel consumed by the carrier in the operation of an\nomnibus in local transit services in New York State. Such services must be\npursuant to (i) a certificate of convenience and necessity issued by the\n\nCommissioner of Transportation of New York State or by the Interstate Commerce\n\nCommission of the United States; or (ii) a contract, franchise or consent\nbetween the omnibus carrier and a city having a population of more than one\nmillion inhabitants, or any agency of such city. The reimbursement provided in\nthis subdivision is limited to the amount of the aggregate State tax of eight\ncents per each gallon of motor fuel. No reimbursement is allowable for any\nlocal tax on leaded motor fuel imposed pursuant to the authority of section\n284-b\nof the Tax Law nor is any reimbursement allowable in respect to charter\nor other contract operations, such as operations under a contract with any\nparty other than a city described in this subdivision. (2)\n\nAn\nomnibus in local transit\nservice\nis an omnibus providing a mass transit service (as\ndistinguished from a charter, contract, school bus, sightseeing or other such\nservice) by carrying passengers from one point in this State to another point\nin this State and which either: (i) regularly\npicks up or discharges such passengers at their convenience or at bus stops on\nthe street or highway, as distinguished from buildings or facilities used for\nbus terminals or stations; or\n(ii)\npicks up and discharges passengers at bus terminals or stations, the distance\nbetween which is not more than 75 miles, measured along the route traveled by\nthe bus. Example 1: Buses of the X Company operate, pursuant to a certificate\nof convenience and necessity from the Commissioner of Transportation, from a\nterminal in the city of A to a station in the city of B and continue to a\nstation in the city of C. The distance from A to B is 80 miles and from B to C\nis 80 miles. Between A and B these buses pick up and discharge passengers at\nstops along the highway, but they do not do this between B and C. Between A and\nB these buses are operated in local transit service, pursuant to subparagraph\n(i) of this paragraph, but not between B and C. The X company may claim a\nreimbursement of tax on one half of the fuel used in the operation of its buses\non this route, since one half of the mileage represents local transit\nservice. Example 2: The facts are the same except that the buses continue\nbeyond the city of C to a terminal in the city of D, 75 miles away. On this\nportion of the route they do not pick up or discharge passengers en route. Here\nthe buses are being operated in local transit service between A and B pursuant\nto subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, and also between C and D pursuant to\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. The X Company may claim a reimbursement of\ntax on 66 percent of the fuel used in operation of this route, since the\nportions of the route in local transit service are 155/235ths of the total\nmileage. Example 3: Buses of the Y Company operate, pursuant to a certificate\nof the Interstate Commerce Commission, from a terminal in A, a city within the\n\nState of New York, to a station in B, a city outside the State of New York. Between the terminal in A and the State boundary the buses do not pick up or\ndischarge any passengers. Here the buses are not being operated in local\ntransit service for they are not carrying passengers from one point in this\n\nState to another point in this State. Had the buses picked up and discharged\npassengers en route within the State, the buses would be considered as\noperating in local transit service, even though the distance from city A to\ncity B may exceed 75 miles, including some mileage outside of the State. However, the reimbursement would be limited to the motor fuel consumed in local\ntransit service within the State of New York only. Example 4: Buses of the Z Company operate pursuant to a certificate\nof the Interstate Commerce Commission, from a terminal in A to a station in B\nand proceed to a terminal in C. Cities A and C are in New York State and city B\nis outside of New York State. The distance between each of the cities along the\nroute traveled is 20 miles. The company carries passengers from city A to\ncities B and C. The buses will be considered as operating in local transit\nservice, since the total distance between points A and C along the route\ntraveled by the bus, is not more than 75 miles, even though the distance from A\nto C includes some mileage outside of the State. However, the reimbursement is\nlimited to the motor fuel consumed in local transit service within the State of\n\nNew York only. (3)\n\nAn omnibus carrier claiming a\nreimbursement of tax paid, pursuant to subparagraph (2)(i) of this subdivision, must keep a daily record of its operations in the form of a vehicular trip\nrecord for each bus, including the vehicle number, the daily gallons of motor\nfuel purchased in and consumed in New York State in local transit services as\ndefined in such subparagraph (i) and the monthly totals of such gallonage. An\nomnibus carrier claiming a reimbursement of tax paid, pursuant to subparagraph\n(2)(ii) of this subdivision, must keep a daily record of its operations in the\nform of a vehicular trip record, including the following information: (i) vehicle number; (ii)\ndate of each trip; (iii)\norigin and destination of each\ntrip; (iv)\npoints between which the\nreimbursement is claimed; (v) total\ndaily miles traveled; (vi)\ntotal\ndaily miles attributed to local transit services (as defined in subparagraph\n[2][ii] of this paragraph); (vii)\ntotal daily gallons of motor fuel consumed; and\n(viii)\ndaily gallons of motor fuel purchased\nin and consumed in New York State in local transit services (as defined in\nsubparagraph [2][ii] of this paragraph); Subparagraphs (v) through (viii) of this paragraph must\neach be totaled at the end of every month for each bus. Records which do not\ninclude the items mentioned above will not be accepted as sufficient basis to\nprove entitlement to a reimbursement unless otherwise approved by the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. Any application for such approval should be\naddressed to: New York State Department of Taxation and Finance\n\nMiscellaneous Tax - Refund Unit\nW.A. Harriman Campus\n\nAlbany, NY 12227\n(d) Motor fuel consumed by nonpublic\nschool operators.

(2)\n\nAn individual or\nentity claiming reimbursement under this subdivision must establish that: (i) it is in fact an exempt individual or\nentity; (ii)\nthe motor fuel was\nacquired under circumstances qualifying for exemption; (iii)\nthe individual or entity was the\npurchaser of record and paid for the motor fuel from the funds of such\nindividual or entity; and\n(iv)\nthat\nthe motor fuel was used or consumed by the individual or entity exclusively for\nits purposes.
