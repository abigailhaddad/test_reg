(4)\n\nConversion and/or continuation. (i) Every policy or certificate of long term care insurance, nursing home insurance only, home care insurance only, or nursing home and home care insurance which provides coverage for dependents, however defined, of the named insured shall entitle those dependents, without evidence of insurability, to a conversion policy or certificate upon application therefore and payment of the first premium within 45 days after coverage under the prior policy or certificate shall have terminated. (ii)\n\nTermination under the following circumstances shall give rise to the right to elect conversion: (a) divorce or annulment; (b) upon the attainment of the limiting age, if any, at which a covered insured's dependent status shall cease; and\n(c) in addition to clause (a) and (b) of this subparagraph, for insureds covered under policies or certificates issued on a group basis the following circumstances shall give rise to the right to elect conversion: (1)\n\nTermination of employment or membership in the group. (2)\n\nTermination of the group policy or certificate. (iii)\n\nSuch conversion policy or certificate will be subject to the following conditions: (a) The premium shall be that applicable to the class of risk to which such person belongs, to the age of such person and to the form and amount of insurance.

(vii)\n\nIn the event that the right to continue arises due to termination of the group policy, said policy shall be deemed delivered to a trustee and all the terms and conditions contained in said policy shall be applicable to certificate holders who have elected to continue coverage thereunder. (5)\n\nOnly benefits that are reasonably related to long term care coverage may be added by rider or endorsement to policies or certificates providing at least the minimum level of benefits required by sections\n52.12\n(a), 52.13\n(a) or (b)\nof this Part.

An insurer may use a reasonable hypothetical, or a graphic demonstration, for the purposes of this disclosure. (7)\n\nNo insurer may offer a long term care insurance policy or certificate unless that policy or certificate, at the option of the insured or policyholder, provides some type of nonforfeiture value, such as reduced paid-up insurance. The reduced paid-up percentages may apply to the nursing home benefits only or to all benefits in the policy or certificate. These percentages must appear in the policy or certificate, and may change based on experience, provided the policy or certificate states that such change will only be made in conjunction with an increase in premium.
