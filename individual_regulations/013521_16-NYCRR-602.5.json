  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 602.5 - Service orders\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Service\nproviders shall receive and respond to applications for tariffed services in a\ntimely manner. Upon the request of a consumer, each service provider shall\nprovide an explanation of the rates, charges and provisions applicable to the\nservices available, respond to questions the consumer may have, and provide\nadditional appropriate information to assist the consumer in obtaining the\ncommunication service(s) that meet the consumer's needs. (b) Where special charges for extraordinary\nconstruction, maintenance, replacement costs, expenses or overtime work are not\nspecifically set forth in a service provider's tariff, the consumer will be\nadvised of the options available. If the service provider is to perform any\nsuch work for a special charge, the service provider shall offer the customer\nthe option of accepting a good faith estimate of the charge to be levied, or of\nbeing billed on an actual cost basis. Once an estimate is accepted by the\ncustomer it will become binding on both parties, and the customer pays the\nestimated charge whether the actual cost is greater or less than the\nestimate. (c) Service providers\nshall notify customers of connection fees and provide an estimated first bill, not reflecting usage charges, prior to processing the customer's\nrequest. (d) Each service provider\nshall inform new residential customers of a 60 day grace period whereby such\nconsumer may select a different type of basic local flat rate service or basic\nlocal measured rate service from that provider without incurring any additional\nconnection or installation charges for basic local service. A grace period\napplies only when the consumer actually incurred an installation charge for\nbasic local service. (e) (1)\n\nNormally, the service provider shall\noffer a consumer applying for its initial basic local exchange service an\ninstallation appointment interval (e.g., the period of time that a premise\nvisit is to take place) within five working days. (2)\n\nAfter such an offer, the consumer may\nnonetheless agree to other terms that better meet the needs of the consumer and\nthe provider (e.g., installation appointments for either morning or\nafternoon). (3)\n\nPrior to an\nappointment, arrangements to access a necessary third party's premises shall be\ndiscussed with the consumer. (f) Normally, when a service provider cannot\nmeet a commitment date to complete an order, the provider shall make a\nreasonable effort to advise the applicant of the reason for the delay, and\nprobable date service will be provided. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n602.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
