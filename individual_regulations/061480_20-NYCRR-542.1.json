The industrial development\nagency issues a letter to K Associates authorizing it to make purchases exempt\nfrom sales and use taxes for the project as agent of the industrial development\nagency. In order to complete the project under the terms of the contract, K\nAssociates hires a general contractor and various subcontractors to work on the\nproject. K Associates, as agent for the industrial development authority, must\nmaintain records and receive information from the general contractor and any\nsubcontractor, consultant and any other agent, sufficient to compute the total\namounts of sales and compensating use tax exemptions claimed with respect to\nthe project by the general contractor and each of the subcontractors, consultants and any other agents of K Associates, whether taken at the time of\npurchase or use, or by refund or credit.

K Associates must report the total amount on the annual\nreport required to be filed with the department. The general contractor, subcontractors, consultants and other agents which work on the project are not\nrequired to file an annual report with the department under this Part. In order\nfor K Associates to complete the report required by this Part properly, its\ngeneral contractor, subcontractors, consultants and other agents must inform K\nAssociates of the total amount of the sales and compensating use tax exemptions\nto which they are entitled with respect to the project, and K Associates must\nmaintain records and furnish to the department upon request, the name, address, employer identification number and total amounts of the sales and compensating\nuse tax exemptions claimed by such general contractor and by each\nsubcontractor, consultant and other agent on the project. (c) Failure to file\npenalty. Where an agent or project operator fails to file a report\nrequired by this section, or files a report which is not substantially\ncomplete, such agent or project operator may be subject to the removal of\nauthority to act as agent or project operator for the industrial development\nagency or authority pursuant to section\n874 (8)\nof the General\n\nMunicipal Law or section\n1963-a (9)\nor\n2327 (9)\nof the Public Authorities Law, as\nthe case may be. (d) Notification of failure to file. (1)\n\nIf, within 30 days of the due date for\nthe report, an agent or project operator has failed to file a report in the\nmanner required by this section or has filed a report which is not\nsubstantially complete, the department shall notify such agent or project\noperator of its noncompliance with this section. (2)\n\nIf the agent or project operator fails to\nfile the required report within 30 days of the date of the department's notice\ndescribed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the department shall notify the\nagent or project operator and the appropriate industrial development agency or\nauthority that continued failure to file the required report within 60 days of\nthe date of the notice provided in this paragraph will result in the removal of\nthe authority of the agent or project operator to act as agent or project\noperator for the agency or authority. The department shall mail a copy of such\nnotice to the appropriate industrial development agency or authority. (3)\n\nIf the department has not received the\nrequired report within 60 days of the date of the notice described in paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision, the authority of the agent or project operator to act\nas agent or project operator for the industrial development agency or authority\nshall terminate as of such 60th day. The department shall, upon expiration of\nsuch 60 days, mail by certified mail to the agent or project operator a notice\nof removal of authority to act as agent or project operator for the industrial\ndevelopment agency or authority. Such notification must: (i) state the effective date of such removal\nof authority; (ii)\nstate the basis\nfor removal of authority to act as agent or project operator; and\n(iii)\nadvise the person whose authority as\nagent or project operator has been removed that the report required by this\nsection must be filed before such person's authority as agent or project\noperator can be restored. The department shall also mail a copy of the notice of\nremoval of authority described in this paragraph to the appropriate industrial\ndevelopment agency or authority, the New York State Department of Economic\n\nDevelopment and the State Comptroller. (e) Effect under the Tax Law of\nremoval of authority to act as an agent or project operator. (1)\n\nAny person whose authority to act as an\nagent or project operator has been removed, as well as any agent of such person\n(including contractors, subcontractors and consultants), is not entitled to the\nsales and compensating use and other tax exemptions provided pursuant to\nsection\n874\nof the General Municipal Law or section\n1963\nor\n2326\nof the Public Authorities Law, as the case may be. (2)\n\nAny loss of authority for a person to act\nas agent or project operator shall remain in effect until the department\nrestores such person's eligibility to act as an agent or project\noperator. (3)\nA person whose\nauthority to act as an agent or project operator has been removed will not be\neligible to act as an agent or project operator until all reports required\nunder this section are properly completed and filed, to the satisfaction of the\ndepartment. Any notice of restoration of authority to act as an agent or\nproject operator shall be mailed to the same parties as the notice of removal\nof authority was mailed, and such restoration shall be effective upon mailing\nby the department. (4)\n\nAny person\nwhose authority to act as agent or project operator has been removed shall be\nliable for, and any agent of such person (including contractors, subcontractors\nand consultants) may be liable for, any sales and compensating use taxes, as\nwell as any other taxes imposed by or pursuant to the authority of the Tax Law, together with any penalty or interest, which accrued during the time such\nremoval of authority was in effect, and shall not be entitled to any refund or\ncredit of any such tax, penalty or interest. Accordingly, the person whose\nauthority to act as agent or project operator has been removed should promptly\nnotify its contractors, subcontractors, consultants and other agents of its\nloss of authority as an industrial development agency or authority agent or\nproject operator, as the case may be. Example: K Associates, appointed as agent for an industrial\ndevelopment authority, is properly notified by the department of the removal of\nits authority to act as agent of the industrial development authority, due to\nthe agent's failure to file the annual report. The effective date of such\nremoval of authority is July 1st. On October 31st of the same year, K\nAssociates submits the delinquent report (properly completed) and requests the\ndepartment to restore its authority to act as agent for the industrial\ndevelopment authority. During the period of removal of authority to act as\nagent, K Associates is not entitled to any sales and use tax exemptions for the\nproject and must pay any tax due on purchases and uses of property or services\nmade for the project during such period. Additionally, such removal of K\nAssociates' authority to act as agent likewise applies to any of its\ncontractors, subcontractors, consultants and other agents. Upon the department's restoration of K Associates'\nauthority to act as agent, K Associates and all its contractors, subcontractors, consultants and other agents are then authorized again to make\npurchases for the project exempt from sales and compensating use taxes, provided that K Associates remains the appointed agent of the industrial\ndevelopment agency. However, neither K Associates nor any of its contractors, subcontractors, consultants or other agents are entitled to any refund or\ncredit of sales and compensating use taxes required to be paid or due on\npurchases and uses of property or services made during the four month period\nfrom July 1st through October 31st when the authority of K Associates to act as\nagent was removed.
