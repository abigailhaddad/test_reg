Support arrears/past\ndue support for child support or combined spousal and child support payable to\nthe support collection unit (SCU) may be enforced by the suspension of the\nsupport obligor's driving privileges when the support obligor is in default as\ndefined in subdivision (b) of this section. (2)\n\nChild support orders in the amount of $25\nper month dated before January 1, 1994 are not subject to enforcement pursuant\nto this section. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nDefault. Subject to the\nlimitation set forth in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, a support obligor is\nin default if he or she has failed to remit to the SCU the accumulation of an\namount equal to or greater than the amount directed by court order to be paid\nfor four months. For purposes of this section, a default may not be founded\nupon the existence of retroactive support; however, if a support obligor\ndefaults subsequent to the date of the court order, retroactive support may be\ncollected pursuant to the provisions of this section. Any support arrears/past\ndue support collected pursuant to this section need not be reduced to\njudgment. (2)\n\nSatisfactory payment\narrangements. For purposes of this section, satisfactory payment arrangements\nmeans: (i) execution of a confession of\njudgment for the total balance of the arrears/past due support; and\n(ii)\nexecution of a verified statement of net\nworth setting forth the support obligor's income from all sources, liquid\nassets, and other holdings, copies of the support obligor's drivers license, most recent Federal and State income tax returns, and a representative pay stub\nfor each source of employment; and an 18-month employment history; and\n(iii)\nexecution and\nverification of a stipulation that the support obligor will notify the SCU of\nall future changes of address until such time as the obligation to pay support\nis terminated; and\n(iv)\npayment of\nsupport to the SCU by an income execution issued pursuant to section\n5241\nof the Civil Practice Law and Rules\n(CPLR), which must include deductions sufficient to ensure compliance with the\ndirection in the order of support and must include an additional amount\ncalculated pursuant to section\n347.9\n(e) of this\n\nTitle to be applied to the reduction of support arrears/past due support, or by\nexecution of an agreement for payment of the support arrears/past due support\nand any current support directly to the SCU in an amount consistent with that\nwhich would be paid under such an income execution.

The notice must\nadvise the support obligor that his or her continued failure to pay the support\narrears/past due support will result in notification to the Department of Motor\n\nVehicles (DMV) to suspend the support obligor's driving privileges unless the\nsupport obligor complies with the requirements set forth in paragraph (7) of\nthis subdivision or asserts pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section a\nwritten challenge to the correctness of the SCU's determination that the\nsupport obligor's driving privileges should be suspended. However, no notice\nwill be issued to a support obligor from whom support payments are being\nreceived by the SCU as a result of an income execution or an income deduction\norder issued pursuant to section 5241 or 5242 of the CPLR.
