(3)\n\nBefore the basket is moved, the operator\nshall observe the location of all obstructions and any other hazards which may\nbe in the vicinity.

(8)\n\nPersons shall\nenter or leave an aerial basket only when such basket is resting on the ground\nor grade level or cradled in the traveling position. Persons shall stand clear\nof the path of the basket and boom when such basket is being lowered. Any\nmovement of the vehicle while persons are elevated in the basket is\nprohibited.
