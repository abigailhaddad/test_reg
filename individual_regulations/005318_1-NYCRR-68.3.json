Tit. 1 § 68.3 - Special provisions for captive cervids susceptible to chronic wasting disease\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nrequirements of this section apply to all captive CWD susceptible cervid\noperations harboring any CWD susceptible captive cervids. (b) All movements of CWD susceptible cervids\ninto New York State are prohibited until August 1, 202 8, except movements to a\nzoo accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, 8403 Colesville Road, Suite 710, Silver Springs, MD 20910-3314. No such movements shall be made\nunless approved prior to the movement by the commissioner or their\ndesignee. (c) Prohibition. No person shall hold CWD susceptible cervids in captivity\nin New York unless they are enrolled in the CWD Certified Herd Program, or the\nCWD Monitored Herd Program. (d) Fencing. The perimeter fence for all herds that contain one or more\nCWD susceptible cervids shall comply with the standards set forth in section\n68.2\n(f) of this\n\nPart. In addition, such fence shall present a continuous barrier at least eight\nfeet high. Breaks in fencing shall be identified within 48 hours of occurrence\nand repaired immediately. In those areas of the State which have been\ndesignated as a CWD containment area by the New York State Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation, either a solid barrier or a second fence must be\nconstructed which will prevent any contact between wild white-tailed deer and\ncaptive CWD susceptible species. (e) Premises inspection required. All captive cervid facilities and perimeter fencing shall\nbe inspected and approved by a State or Federal regulatory representative. The\ninitial inspection shall be conducted prior to the addition of any cervids. Cervids may not be added to the premises prior to inspection and approval. For\nherds which are being enrolled in the CWD Herd Certification Program, physical\nrestraint equipment adequate for the number of cervids to be held in the\nenclosure shall be in place before the herd is enrolled in the program. Facilities and fencing shall be subject to inspection by State and Federal\nregulatory officials periodically thereafter in order to maintain program\nparticipant status. (f) Recordkeeping. Accurate records documenting purchases, sales, interstate\nshipments, intrastate shipments, escaped cervids and deaths (including\nharvested cervids) shall be established and maintained for at least 72 months\nfor all captive CWD susceptible cervid operations. Documentation shall be made\navailable to State or Federal regulatory officials during normal business\nhours. Information provided in the records shall include individual animal\nidentification, carcass/sample identification tag, sex, species and age. In\naddition, the owners of all CWD susceptible cervid herds enrolled in the CWD\nCertified Herd Program, shall establish and maintain accurate records that\ndocument the results of the annual herd inventory. Inventory records must be\nreconciled with previous inventory. All lost individual identification must be\nnoted and replaced by a unique official identification. Such replacement shall\nbe noted in the record. These records shall be maintained for six years. (g) No person shall serve, sell, expose for sale, give away or donate the carcass, or any part thereof, including the head, of any CWD susceptible cervid that has been sampled for\ntesting for CWD unless and until it has been determined that the test is \"not\ndetected\" or negative for CWD.
