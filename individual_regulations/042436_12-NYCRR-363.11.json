Once the employer receives the request for disability benefits from an\nemployee, the employer shall complete the employer information and return it to\nthe employee within three business days. (b) Such notice and proof shall include\nstatements furnished by the claimant and the claimant's attending physician, podiatrist, certified nurse midwife, chiropractor or dentist in form prescribed\nfor such purpose by the chairman. The attending physician, podiatrist, certified nurse midwife, chiropractor or dentist shall complete and mail such\nform to the carrier or self-insured employer, or return it to the claimant, within seven days of receipt of the form. (c) A carrier, employer or the chairman may\ninvestigate a claim and for cause require additional information. (d) Failure to furnish notice or proof within\nthirty days after commencement of the period of disability shall not invalidate\nthe claim, but no benefits shall be required to be paid for any period more\nthan two weeks prior to the date on which the required proof is furnished. However, if claimant shows it was not reasonably possible to furnish such\nnotice or proof within thirty days and that such notice or proof was furnished\nas soon as possible (e.g., delay by medical provider, or claimant was\nincapacitated), such delay may be excused and benefits may be payable for the\nfull period of disability; provided required proof of disability is furnished\nwithin 26 weeks after commencement of the period of disability.
