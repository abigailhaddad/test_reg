  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 134.2 - Family offense designation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An\naccusatory instrument that charges a defendant in a criminal proceeding with a\nfamily offense shall include a designation that an offense charged therein is a\nfamily offense and a description of the relationship between defendant and the\nalleged victim. Such designation and description shall be placed on the upper\nright hand corner of the accusatory instrument in the following form: FO\nDefendant:....(relationship to alleged victim)........................................................... Alleged victim:.. (relationship to\ndefendant)........................................................... (b) The designation shall be\nplaced on the accusatory instrument by the criminal justice agency that\nprepares that instrument, provided that where a accusatory instrument charging\na family offense has not been prepared by a criminal justice agency, the court\nshall place such designation on the accusatory instrument. (c) Where protection of the identity of an\nalleged victim of a family offense is required by law or otherwise is deemed\nappropriate, and where placement of the family offense designation on the\naccusatory instrument would tend to identify the victim, the criminal justice\nagency may file instead a separate statement annexed to the accusatory\ninstrument, alerting the court that a family offense is charged therein and\ndescribing defendant's relationship to the alleged victim. Such statement shall\nnot be made available to the public. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\n§\n134.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
