  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-3.2 - Custodian accounts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Custodian accounts in a bank provide the best means of safekeeping for\nsecurities issued in bearer form. It will be found that short-term U.S. government obligations, such as treasury bills, notes and certificates of\nindebtedness, which are recommended for short term investments, are ordinarily\nissued in bearer form. Under most circumstances, the most satisfactory\narrangement, when such securities are purchased, is to have the bank handling\nthe acquisition of the securities act as custodian. Many banks will act as\ncustodians for U.S. government securities without charge and local agencies\nshould endeavor to make arrangements with such banks. The division will be glad\nto advise if difficulty is encountered in this respect. In any event, arrangements involving the payment of custodian fees should be submitted to the\ndivision for prior approval. Custodian fees, if any, are charged to the same\naccount as safe deposit rentals (see §\n1645-3.3, below). (b) The resolution of the local agency\nauthorizing the opening of a custodian account shall specify that the release\nof the securities, in whole or in part, from the custodian account shall be\naccomplished only upon the signature and counter signature of at least two\nauthorized persons, who shall also be check signers. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1645-3.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
