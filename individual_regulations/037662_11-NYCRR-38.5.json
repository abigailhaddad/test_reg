  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 38.5 - Access to providers for insureds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If an insured is unable to schedule an appointment with a participating provider of behavioral health services within the appointment wait times set forth in section 38.4 of this Part because there is not a participating provider of behavioral health services available within the appointment wait times who can treat the insured's behavioral health condition, the insured, or the insured's designee, may submit an access complaint by telephone or in writing to the health care plan to resolve the access issue. (b) The health care plan shall have three business days from receipt of the access complaint to locate a participating provider of behavioral health services that can treat the insured's behavioral health condition and is able to meet the appointment wait times set forth in section 38.4 of this Part and to give the insured or the insured's designee the name of and contact information for the provider or providers by telephone, if the request was made by telephone, and in writing. If the insured specifically requests an in-person appointment, the provider shall be located within a reasonable distance from the insured; however, the distance may be greater for insureds who reside in rural areas than for insureds who do not reside in rural areas. (c) If the health care plan is unable to locate a participating provider of behavioral health services that can treat the insured's behavioral health condition, is able to meet the appointment wait times set forth in section 38.4 of this Part, and is located within a reasonable distance from the insured if the insured specifically requests an in person appointment, the health care plan shall: (1)\nnotify the insured by telephone, if the request was made by telephone, and in writing, at the expiration of the time period in subdivision (b) of this section that the insured may obtain a referral to a non-participating provider at the in-network cost-sharing and include contact information for the New York State Behavioral Health Ombudsman Program; and\n(2)\napprove a referral to a non-participating provider, regardless of whether the insured's coverage includes out-of-network benefits, if the non-participating provider: (i) can treat the insured's behavioral health condition; (ii)\nis able to meet the appointment wait times set forth in section 38.4 of this Part, as measured from the insured's receipt of the notification in paragraph (1) of this subdivision; (iii)\nis located within a reasonable distance from the insured if the insured specifically requests an in person appointment; and\n(iv)\ncharges rates that are not excessive or unreasonable. (d) The approved referral shall remain in effect until the earlier of the following: (1)\nthe behavioral health services are no longer medically necessary; or\n(2)\nthe health care plan locates a participating provider of behavioral health services that can treat the insured's behavioral health condition, is able to meet the appointment wait times set forth in section 38.4 of this Part and is located within a reasonable distance from the insured if the insured specifically requests an in-person appointment, and the insured's treatment can be transitioned to the participating provider, unless the health care plan determines, in consultation with the insured's treating provider, as appropriate, that such transition would be harmful to the insured. If the insured or the insured's designee disagrees with the health care plan's transition of care determination, the insured or the insured's designee may request an expedited determination or appeal pursuant to Insurance Law section 4802 or 4904, as applicable. (e) The health care plan shall not impose cost-sharing on the insured, including a copayment, coinsurance, or deductible, for the service rendered by a non-participating provider pursuant to an approved referral, that is greater than the cost-sharing that the insured would owe if the insured had received services from a participating provider. The health care plan shall apply the out-of-pocket maximum that would have applied had the services been received from a participating provider. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
