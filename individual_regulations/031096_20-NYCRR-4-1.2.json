  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-1.2 - General rules for apportionment\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A)\n(a) All corporations must apportion within\nand without New York State their total business income and business capital by\na business apportionment factor (BAF) that is a fraction. The numerator and\ndenominator of the BAF includes only those receipts, net income, net gains, and\nother items described in section 210-A and this Subchapter that are included in\nthe computation of entire net income for the taxable year. The numerator of the\nBAF is the sum of all amounts required to be included in the numerator pursuant\nto section 210-A and this Subchapter (New York receipts) and the denominator of\nthe BAF is the sum of all amounts required to be included in the denominator\npursuant to section 210-A and this Subchapter (everywhere receipts). (b) The following amounts shall not be\nincluded in either New York receipts or everywhere receipts: (1)\ngross income from investment capital, even if such income is included in business income pursuant to the 8% of entire\nnet income (ENI) limitation on gross investment income. (2)\nany portion of gross other exempt income\ngenerated by stock that is not marked to market. (3)\nany portion of gross other exempt income\ngenerated by stock that is marked to market in instances where the taxpayer did\nnot make the fixed percentage election for qualified financial\ninstruments. (4)\namounts specified\nin section 208(9)(a) to be subtracted from federal taxable income in the\ncomputation of ENI (other than the subtractions for qualified banks provided\nfor in section 208(9)(a)(19)). (5)\namounts specified in section 208(9)(b) to be added back to federal taxable\nincome in the computation of ENI (other than the addition modification for\nalien corporations not deemed domestic under any provision of the IRC provided\nfor in section 208(9)(b)(1) and the addition modification for dividends or\ninterest provided for in section 208(9)(b)(2)). (6)\ncertain reimbursements of expenses paid\nfor by the corporation on behalf of a customer that are received from the\ncustomer in advance or received from the customer and placed by the corporation\ninto a separate account, provided the reimbursement does not exceed the amount\nof expenses, and does not exceed reimbursements received by the corporation\nunder a cost-sharing arrangement the corporation has with another company where\nthat cost-sharing arrangement does not include any mark-up of the expense. In\nthe case of a cost-sharing arrangement that the corporation has with another\ncompany that includes a mark-up of expenses, only the amount of the mark-up\nshall be included in business receipts. (c) Example. Corporation A is a professional employer organization\n(\"PEO\"). It contracts with its customers to provide a number of services, including the handling of the payment of wages, the withholding of the\nemployees\" and customers\" necessary statutory taxes and unemployment insurance\npayments, and the remitting of such taxes and unemployment insurance payments\nto the Department and the Department of Labor. In order to provide these\nservices, the PEO may have to pay out of its own account the wages of the\nemployees and other expenses before it is reimbursed by its customers from\nfunds in a dedicated account set up on behalf of its customers for those wages\nand other expenses. The amount reimbursed does not exceed the amount of\nexpenses. These reimbursements are not considered business receipts and, therefore, are not included in New York receipts or everywhere receipts. (d) All business receipts for the\nperiod covered by the report, computed on a cash or accrual basis according to\nthe method of accounting used in the computation of its ENI, must be taken into\naccount. (e) New York and\neverywhere receipts shall be computed using the rules in section 210-A and this\n\nSubchapter. For certain types of receipts, the provisions of this Subchapter\nprovide further guidance. Such rules shall be applied to each receipt, item of\nincome, gain, or other item described in section 210-A except as otherwise\nprovided. (f) A corporation's\nmethod of apportioning its receipts must reflect an attempt to comply with the\nregulatory standards set forth herein rather than an attempt to minimize the\ncorporation's tax liability. (g) A\ncorporation's application of the regulatory standards set forth in this\n\nSubchapter must be based on objective criteria and should consider all sources\nof information reasonably available to the corporation at the time of filing\nits original tax return, including, without limitation, the corporation's books\nand records, including its contracts or agreements with its customers, kept in\nthe ordinary course of business. Corporations may, in good faith, rely on\ninformation provided by their customers. (h) A corporation's method of sourcing its\nreceipts must be determined in good faith, applied in good faith, and applied\nconsistently with respect to similar transactions. (i) A corporation must retain records that\nexplain the determination and application of its method of sourcing its\nreceipts used in completing the return, including its underlying assumptions, and must provide such records to the commissioner upon request. (j) A corporation must take reasonable steps\nto update its existing systems of recording transactions or the current format\nof its books and records to capture the information required by these rules. It\nis not sufficient to rely on the fact that existing systems do not adequately\ncapture the required information. (k) In determining the amount of New York\nreceipts, the corporation must consider the location during the entire time\nperiod in which the activity generating the receipts occurs. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
