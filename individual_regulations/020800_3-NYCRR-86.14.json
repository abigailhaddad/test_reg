Furnish in comparative columnar form a summary of selected\nfinancial data for the converting institution for: (1)\neach of the last five fiscal years of the\nconverting institution (or for the life of the converting institution and its\npredecessors, if less); and\n(2)\nany\nadditional fiscal years necessary to keep the summary from being misleading. Instructions. 1. The purpose of the summary of selected\nfinancial data shall be to supply in convenient and readable format selected\ndata which highlight significant trends in the converting institution's\nfinancial condition and results of operations. 2.

(c) Management's Discussion and\n\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (1)\n\nDiscuss the converting institution's\nfinancial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations. The discussion shall provide information as specified in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph with respect to liquidity, capital resources, and results of operations and also should provide all other information which\nthe converting institution believes to be necessary to an understanding of its\nfinancial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of operations. Significant business combinations should be discussed. Discussion of liquidity\nand capital resources may be combined whenever the two topics are interrelated. Where in the converting institution's judgment a discussion of subdivisions of\nthe converting institution's business would be appropriate to an understanding\nof the business, the discussion should focus on each relevant, reportable\nsegment or other subdivision of the business and on the converting institution\nas a whole. (i) Liquidity. Identify any known trends or any known demands, commitments, events, or\nuncertainties which will result in or which are reasonably likely to result in\nthe converting institution's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material\nway. If a material deficiency is identified, indicate the course of action\nwhich the converting institution has taken or proposes to take to remedy the\ndeficiency. Identify and separately describe internal and external sources of\nliquidity, and briefly discuss any material unused sources of liquid assets. Comment on maturity imbalances between assets and liabilities and planned\nactivities in the secondary mortgage market. (ii)\n\nCommitted Resources. (a) Describe the converting institution's\nmaterial commitments for loan fundings or other expenditures as of the end of\nthe last fiscal period and indicate the general purpose of the commitments and\nthe anticipated source of funds needed to fulfill the commitments. (b) Describe any known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, in the converting institution's committed resources. Indicate any expected material changes in the mix and the relative cost of the\nresources. This discussion should consider changes between savings, equity, debt, and any off-balance-sheet financing arrangements. (iii)\n\nResults of Operations. (a) Describe any unusual or infrequent events\nor transactions or any significant economic changes that materially affected\nthe amount or reported income from continuing operations and, in each case, indicate the extent to which income was affected. In addition, describe any\nother significant components of revenues or expenses which, in the converting\ninstitution's judgment should be described in order to understand the\nconverting institution's results of operations. (b) Describe any known trends or\nuncertainties which have had, or which the converting institution reasonably\nexpects will have, a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on net sales or\nrevenues or income from continuing operations. If the converting institution\nknows of events which will cause a material change in the relationship between\ncosts and revenues (such as known future increases in costs of money or\ninterest rates) the change in the relationship should be disclosed. (c) To the extent that the financial\nstatements disclose material increases in interest expense, provide a narrative\ndiscussion of the extent to which the increases are attributable to increases\nin rates or to increases in volume. (d) For the three most recent fiscal years of\nthe converting institution, or for those fiscal years in which the converting\ninstitution has been engaged in business, whichever period is shorter, discuss\nthe impact of inflation and changing prices on the converting institution's\nrevenues and on income from continuing operations. (e) For the most recent financial statement\npresented, discuss any unusual risk characteristics in the assets of the\nconverting institution. This would include real estate development, significant\namounts of commercial real estate as loan collateral, and any other significant\nrisk factors inherent in the converting institution's lending or investment\nportfolios, including significant increases in amounts of nonaccrual, past due, restructured, and potential problem loans. Instructions. 1. The converting institution's discussion\nand analysis shall be of the financial statements and of other statistical data\nwhich the converting institution believes will enhance a reader's understanding\nof its financial condition, changes in financial condition, and results of\noperations. Generally, the discussion should cover the three-year period\ncovered by the financial statements and should utilize year-to-year comparisons\nor other formats which in the converting institution's judgment enhance a\nreader's understanding. However, where trend information is relevant, reference\nto the five-year selected financial data appearing in Item 7(b) above may be\nnecessary. 2. The purpose of the\ndiscussion and analysis should be to provide to investors and other users\ninformation relevant to an assessment of the financial condition and results of\noperations of the converting institution as determined by evaluating the\namounts and certainty of cash flows from operations and from outside sources. The information provided in this Item 7(c) need only include that which is\navailable to the converting institution without undue effort or expense and\nwhich does not clearly appear in the converting institution's financial\nstatements. 3. The discussion and\nanalysis should specifically focus on material events and uncertainties known\nto management which would cause reported financial information not to be\nnecessarily indicative of future operating results or future financial\ncondition. This would include description and amounts of (a) matters which\nwould have an impact on future operations and have not had an impact in the\npast, and (b) matters which would have an impact on reported operations and are\nnot expected to have an impact upon future operations. 4. Where the consolidated financial\nstatements reveal material changes from year to year in one or more line items, the causes for the changes should be described to the extent necessary to an\nunderstanding of the converting institution's business as a whole; provided, however, if the causes for a change in one line item also relate to other line\nitems, no repetition is required and a line-by-line analysis of the financial\nstatements as a whole is not required or generally appropriate. Converting\ninstitutions need not recite the amounts of changes from year to year which are\nreadily computable from the financial statements. The discussion should not\nmerely repeat numerical data contained in the consolidated financial\nstatements. 5. The term\nliquidity\nas used in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this Item 7 refers\nto the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet\nthe enterprise's needs for cash. Except where it is otherwise clear from the\ndiscussion, the converting institution should indicate those balance sheet\nconditions or income or cash flow items which the converting institution\nbelieves may be indicators of its liquidity condition. Liquidity generally\nshould be discussed on both a long-term and short-term basis. The issue of\nliquidity should be discussed in the context of the converting institution's\nown business or businesses. 6. Converting institutions are encouraged, but not required, to supply\nforward-looking information. This is to be distinguished from presently known\ndata which will have an impact upon future operating results, such as known\nfuture increases in rates or other costs. This latter data is required to be\ndisclosed. 7. Converting\ninstitutions which elect to provide narrative explanations of supplementary\ninformation disclosed in accordance with Instruction 7 to Item 7(c)(1) of 12\nCFR\n563b.101\n(see footnote #1), may combine the explanations with their\ndiscussion and analysis required pursuant to this provision or they may supply\nthe information separately. 8. Converting institutions which elect not to provide explanations of\nsupplementary information disclosed in accordance with Instruction 8 to Item\n7(c)(1) of 12 CFR\n563b.101\n(see footnote #1). 9. All references to the converting\ninstitution in the discussion and in these instructions shall mean the\nconverting institution and its consolidated subsidiaries. (2)\n\nIf interim-period\nfinancial statements are included or are required to be included by Item 14, a\nmanagement's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of\noperations shall be provided to enable the reader to assess material changes in\nfinancial condition and results of operations between the periods specified in\n(i) and (ii) below. The discussion and analysis shall include a discussion of\nmaterial changes in those items specifically listed in paragraph (c)(1) of this\n\nItem 7, except that the impact of inflation and changing prices on operations\nfor interim period needs not be addressed. (i) Material Changes in Financial Condition. Discuss any material\nchanges in financial condition from the end of the preceding fiscal year to the\ndate of the most recent interim balance sheet provided. If the interim\nfinancial statements include an interim balance sheet as of the corresponding\ninterim date of the preceding fiscal year, any material change in financial\ncondition from that date to the date of the most recent interim balance sheet\nprovided shall also be discussed. If discussions of changes from both the end\nand the corresponding interim date of the preceding fiscal year are required, the discussions may be combined at the discretion of the converting\ninstitution. (ii)\n\nMaterial\n\nChanges in Results of Operations. Discuss any material changes in the\nconverting institution's results of operations with respect to the most recent\nfiscal year-to-date period for which an income statement is provided and the\ncorresponding year-to-date period of the preceding fiscal year. If the\nconverting institution is required to or has elected to provide an income\nstatement for the most recent fiscal year quarter, the discussion also shall\ncover material changes with respect to that fiscal quarter and the\ncorresponding fiscal quarter in the preceding fiscal year. In addition, if the\nconverting institution has elected to provide an income statement for the\n12-month period ended as of the date of the most recent interim balance sheet\nprovided, the discussion shall also cover material changes with respect to that\n12-month period and the 12-month period ended as of the corresponding interim\nbalance sheet date of the preceding fiscal year. Instructions. 1. If interim financial statements are\npresented together with financial statements for full fiscal years, the\ndiscussion of the interim financial information shall be prepared pursuant to\nparagraph (c)(2) and the discussion of the full fiscal year information shall\nbe prepared pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this Item 7. Such discussions may\nbe combined. 2. The discussion and\nanalysis required by this paragraph (c)(2) is required to focus only on\nmaterial changes. Where the interim financial statements reveal material\nchanges from period to period in one or more significant line items, the causes\nfor the changes should be described if they have not already been disclosed; however, if the causes for a change in one line item also relate to other line\nitems, no repetition is required. Converting institutions need not recite the\namounts of changes from period to period which are readily computable from the\nfinancial statements. This discussion should not merely repeat numerical data\ncontained in the financial statements. The information provided should include\nthat which is available to the converting institution without undue effort or\nexpense and which does not clearly appear in the converting institution's\ninterim financial statements. 3. The converting institution's discussion of material changes in results of\noperations should identify any significant elements of the converting\ninstitution's income or loss from continuing operations which do not arise from\nor are not necessarily representative of the converting institution's ongoing\nbusiness. 4. Converting\ninstitutions are encouraged but are not required to discuss forward-looking\ninformation. (d) Lending Activities.

The descriptions may include maps illustrating one or more of\nthese areas. Furnish an estimate of the housing vacancy rates in areas where\nthe converting institution' s loan concentrations are located, if\npracticable. (3)\n\nDescribe\nbriefly the general long-term nature of investment in mortgage loans and the\nconsequent effect upon the earnings spread of thrift institutions. State the\nnormal maturity of loans made by the converting institution on the security of\nsingle-family dwellings and furnish an estimate as to the average length of\ntime the loans are outstanding. (4)\n\nFor each of the periods required by Item 14(b), set forth in tabular form, excluding fees which are not considered adjustments of yield, the following: (i) Average yield during the period on: (a) loan portfolio, (b) investment portfolio, (c) other interest-earning assets, and\n(d) all interest-earning assets. Average yield should be computed on no greater than a monthly basis. (ii)\n\nAverage rate paid during the\nperiod on: (a) deposits, (b) borrowings and Federal Home Loan Bank\nadvances, (c) other interest-bearing\nliabilities, (d) all\ninterest-bearing liabilities ([a], [b], and [c]).

Average\ninterest-earning assets should be determined on an interval no more frequent\nthan monthly. (v) For each of the\nperiods required by Item 14(b), set forth in tabular form: (a) the dollar amount of change in interest\nincome and\n(b) the dollar amount of\nchange in interest expense. The changes should be segregated for each major\ncategory of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability (as stated in\n[i] and [ii] above) into amounts attributable to (1) changes in volume (change\nin volume multiplied by old rate), (2) changes in rates (change in rate\nmultiplied by old volume), and (3) changes in rate-volume (change in rate\nmultiplied by the change in volume). The rate/volume variances should be\nallocated on a consistent basis between rate and volume variance and the basis\nof allocation disclosed in a note the table. (5)\n\nFor each of the periods required by Item\n14(b), present the following: (i) return on\nassets (net income divided by average total assets); (ii)\nreturn on equity (net income divided by\naverage equity); (iii)\nequity-to-assets ratio (average equity divided by average total assets). Instructions. Converting institutions should\nsupply any additional ratios which they deem necessary to explain their\noperations.

Scheduled principal repayments should be\nreported in the maturity category in which the payment is due. 2. Demand loans, loans having no stated\nschedule of repayments and no stated maturity, and over-drafts should be\nreported as due in one year or less. 3. Determinations of maturities should be\nbased upon contract terms. However, such terms may vary due to the converting\ninstitution's \"rollover policy,\" in which case the maturity should be revised\nas appropriate and the rollover policy should be briefly\ndiscussed. (7)\n\nDescribe briefly the risk elements within the loan and investment portfolios\nincluding the converting institution's customary procedures regarding\ndelinquent loans. As of the end of each of the periods covered by the\nstatements of operation required by Item 14(b)(1) and as of the date of the\nlatest statement of financial condition required by Item 14(a), set forth in\ntabular form the amounts and categories of nonaccrual, past due, restructured, and potential problem loans and the ratio of such loans to total assets.

In addition, disclose the\napproximate average short-term borrowings outstanding during the period and the\napproximate weighted-average interest rate (and a brief description of the\nmeans used to compute such average) for such aggregate short-term borrowings. The disclosure required by this paragraph (3) need not be furnished as regards\nborrowings in each particular category when the aggregate amount of such\nborrowings at the balance sheet date does not exceed one percent of assets at\nthat date. Notwithstanding this reporting threshold, if the weighted average of\nsuch borrowings outstanding during the year exceeds one percent of assets at\nyear-end and significantly exceeds the amount of such borrowings at year-end, the disclosure called for by this paragraph (3) should be furnished. This\ninformation is not required to be given for any category of short-term\nborrowings for which the average balance outstanding during the period was less\nthan 30 percent of stockholders' equity at the end of the period.
