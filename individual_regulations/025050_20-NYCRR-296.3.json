  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 296.3 - Certificate of nonresidence and apportionment of wages for services within and without the City of New York\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. An employer who is required to withhold City of New York earnings tax\non nonresidents (see section\n296.1\nof this Part) must deduct and withhold such City of New York earnings tax on\nnonresidents on all wages paid to an employee who is a nonresident of the City\nof New York for all services performed in the City of New York. Wages paid to a\nnonresident employee for personal services rendered entirely without the City\nof New York are not subject to withholding of City of New York earnings tax on\nnonresidents. (b) Certificate of\nnonresidence. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (d) of this section, employees who are nonresidents of the City of New York and perform any services\nwithin the City of New York must file with such employee's employer a \"City of\n\nNew York Certificate of Nonresidence,\" form IT-2104.2, and such employer must\nthen deduct and withhold City of New York earnings tax based on the information\nfurnished in such certificate of nonresidence. (c) Content of certificate. An employee\nclaiming City of New York nonresident status shall certify on a City of New\n\nYork Certificate of Nonresidence that such employee is not a resident of the\n\nCity of New York, and if an employee claiming City of New York nonresident\nstatus earns wages for services performed partly within and partly without the\n\nCity of New York, such employee must indicate on such certificate of\nnonresidence a reasonable estimate of the portion of total wages to be earned\nduring the taxable year which represents compensation for services performed\nwithin the City of New York during such taxable year. The portion of wages\nallocated to services performed within the City of New York must be determined\nin accordance with the provisions of section\n171.6\nof this Title. (d) Certificate of\nnonresidence not required. An employee (1) who is a nonresident of the City of\n\nNew York, and (2) who performs services partly within and partly without the\n\nCity of New York (other than the services described in section\n171.6\n[b][2][i]\nof this Title), and (3) whose total wages for the taxable year from services\nperformed within the City of New York are not reasonably expected to exceed\n$3,000 (or $3,000 prorated for taxable periods of less than one year), and (4)\nwhose address, as provided by such employee, on form IT-2104 (or on Federal\nform W-4 if such form IT-2104 has not been provided), indicates that such\nemployee is presumably a nonresident of the City of New York, shall not be\nrequired to file a City of New York Certificate of Nonresidence with such\nemployee's employer, and such employer need not deduct and withhold any amount\nof City of New York earnings tax on nonresidents from such employee's\nwages. (e) The mere filing of a\n\nCity of New York Certificate of Nonresidence does not, however, relieve the\nemployer from the duty of withholding the proper amount of City of New York\nearnings tax on nonresidents from wages paid to a nonresident employee for\nservices performed in the City of New York. The City of New York Certificate of\n\nNonresidence filed with an employer must be retained by such employer and must\nbe available for inspection by representatives of the Commissioner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n296.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
