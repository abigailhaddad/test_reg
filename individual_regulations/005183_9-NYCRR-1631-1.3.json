Gasoline, paint thinners and related items should be kept in containers\nhaving self-closing spouts. Oily and greasy rags should be kept temporarily in\na metal safety can until such time as they can be disposed of properly. Excess\naccumulations must not be permitted. Items permitted in storerooms should be\nrestricted to empty trunks, valises, foot lockers, baby carriages, walkers, tricycles, bicycles, sleds and similar items which are used seasonally or at\nperiodic intervals. All other items, including, but not limited to, bedding, mattresses, furniture, kitchen utensils and equipment, clothing, appliances, tools, guns, rifles, sporting equipment, and rubber tires are not to be stored\nfor tenants. Items authorized to be stored must be kept in an orderly\narrangement, with at least a three foot unobstructed aisle to reach remote\nareas of room. Articles should not be stacked higher than two feet from\nceiling. (b) Matches, cigarettes, etc. Tenants are usually the worst offenders in the careless use of these\nitems. Many tragedies have been caused by children playing with matches. The\ntenant aspect of this matter is more fully covered below under section\n1631-1.4, Fire prevention\ncampaigns. However, project personnel must also exercise extreme caution in\nthese matters. Smoking can not be allowed in hazardous areas or when working\nwith flammable material. Personnel should be careful not to dispose of lighted\nmatches or cigarettes into wastepaper baskets. (c) Gas leaks.

Tenants should be warned to ventilate\napartment fully and to notify project office immediately (or local utility\ncompany when office is not open) if they have the least suspicion of leaking\ngas. Project personnel should investigate such reports at once with local\nutility company being called if necessary. (2)\n\nTenants should be advised to be\nespecially careful when moving gas ranges for cleaning purposes so as not to\ndamage or loosen connection. Pilot lights on gas fired equipment and spring\naction gas cocks for ovens are frequent sources of trouble and should be\nexamined periodically. (3)\n\nWrenches\nto shut off main gas valves should be placed near such valves so as to be\nreadily available for use in event of emergency, provided such valves are not\nlocated in an area accessible to unauthorized persons who might use wrench to\ntamper with valve, interrupting gas supply and creating a serious\nhazard.

Exit doorways, other than those normally used for entrance, shall be plainly marked by\napproved exit signs. (2)\n\nDirectional signs, as needed, will be used when such exit doorways are not\nvisible from all locations in public corridors. Where such exit doorways are\ndesignated by a red electric bulb, daily check shall be made and any burned out\nbulbs immediately replaced. In addition, exit doors and lights in community\nrooms must be checked immediately prior to any intended use of such rooms. Doors should actually be opened to ascertain that they are operable. Special\nattention should be given to exit doors in winter, making certain that snow or\nice does not obstruct opening of door. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
