  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 491.5 - Temporary permits\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 522 and 528(b)\n(a) (1)\n\nIf\na carrier requires the immediate and continued use in New York State of a\nqualified motor vehicle for which a fuel use tax license and decal(s) are\nrequired, but which have not yet been obtained, a vehicle specific temporary\nfuel use tax permit may be obtained through various permit services located\nwithin and without this State. (2)\nA permit service will require the carrier to furnish sufficient information to\ncomplete the application prescribed by the department for the purpose of\nobtaining temporary permits. The permit service will, in turn, contact the\ndepartment and the department will determine whether or not the temporary\npermit should be issued. In the event that the temporary permit is denied, it\nwould be unlawful for the carrier to operate the qualified motor vehicle, for\nwhich the permit was requested, upon the public highways of this State or, where applicable, of any other IFTA jurisdiction. In the event that the\ntemporary permit is approved, the permit service will arrange for the payment\nof the New York State decal fee of four dollars per each required decal, where\napplicable, and for the carrier to immediately receive the temporary permit. The temporary permit will set forth the carrier's name and address, a\ndescription of the qualified motor vehicle, the period of time for which the\npermit is valid and such additional information as the department may require. No fuel use tax decal(s) need accompany such permit. Regardless of whether the\ntemporary permit is denied or approved, the permit service may charge the\ncarrier for its assistance in applying for such permit. (3)\n(i) In\naccordance with the joint administration provisions of article 21-A of the Tax\n\nLaw, the department will prescribe a joint application for purposes of\nobtaining either a combined temporary highway use tax/New York State fuel use\ntax permit; or, a separate temporary highway use tax permit and a separate\ntemporary IFTA permit. (ii)\n\nWhere\nan intrastate or other non-IFTA carrier is not required to obtain a highway use\ntax permit and sticker (\ne.g., an omnibus, a three-axle vehicle\nweighing less than 18,001 pounds, etc.) the combined application may be used to\nobtain a temporary New York State fuel use tax permit only. (b) (1)\n\nThe following carriers are eligible to\nobtain a temporary permit for any qualified motor vehicle to be operated in New\n\nYork State: (i) any carrier eligible for a New\n\nYork State fuel use tax license and decal (\ni.e., intrastate or\nother non-IFTA carrier), as described in section\n491.3\nof this Part; (ii)\na validly\nlicensed New York-based IFTA carrier seeking to add a qualified motor vehicle\nto such carrier's fleet (such a permit is also valid in all other IFTA\njurisdictions); and\n(ii)\na New\n\nYork-based carrier eligible for an IFTA license and decals, but who has not\nobtained such license and decals (such permit, however, is not valid in other\nIFTA jurisdictions). (c) A temporary permit is valid for a period\nof 30 days from the date of issuance and must be carried in the qualified motor\nvehicle for which it is issued. Within such 30-day period the department will\nissue, for the qualified motor vehicle for which the temporary permit was\nobtained, the following: (1)\nin the case of\nan intrastate or other non-IFTA carrier, a combined highway use tax permit/New\n\nYork State fuel use tax license and a combined highway use tax sticker/New York\n\nState fuel use tax decal; (2)\nin\nthe case of an intrastate or other non-IFTA carrier not required to obtain a\nhighway use tax permit and sticker, a New York State fuel use tax license and\ndecal only; (3)\nin the case of an\nIFTA carrier based in New York and licensed in accordance with the provisions\nof section\n491.4\nof\nthis Part, a highway use tax permit and sticker and two IFTA decals (a copy of\nthe licensee's IFTA license must be carried in such qualified motor vehicle); and\n(4)\nin the case of a carrier\neligible for an IFTA license and decals as described in section\n491.4\nof\nthis Part, but not licensed in accordance with the provisions of such section, a highway use tax permit and sticker. Where a New York-based carrier eligible\nfor an IFTA license and decals has also submitted a separate application for an\nIFTA license and decals, the department, upon approval of the application, will\nissue an IFTA license and decals. It is the responsibility of such licensee to\nreproduce a copy of the IFTA license to be carried in the qualified motor\nvehicle for which the temporary permit was obtained and to affix the IFTA\ndecals to such qualified motor vehicle.
