  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 702.16 - Derivation and implementation of effluent limitations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Standards and guidance values shall be\nused to control taste-, color- and odor-producing, toxic and deleterious\nsubstances, as specified in the narrative standards for fresh and saline\nsurface waters and groundwaters and shall be the basis of water quality-based\neffluent limitations and groundwater effluent limitations for use in SPDES\npermits issued pursuant to Parts 750-758 of this Title. (b) Surface water effluent limitations. (1)\n\nWhen deriving a water quality-based\neffluent limitation from a surface water standard or guidance value, the\ndepartment may take into account factors, including but not limited to\nanalytical detectability, treatability, natural background levels, intermittent\nstreamflow, wet weather events, and the waste assimilative capacity of the\nreceiving waters. (2)\n\nWhere these\nfactors indicate that achieving a water quality-based effluent limitation would\nbe clearly unreasonable, the department may substitute a modified effluent\nlimitation. Where the effluent limitation had been derived from an aquatic\nstandard or guidance value, the department shall also require biological\nmonitoring. (3)\nA surface water\neffluent limitation for the total of organic substances that have a Health\n(Water Source) standard for surface water in Table 1 of section\n703.5\n(f) of this\n\nTitle or a guidance value for surface water derived pursuant to section\n702.15\n(a) of this\n\nPart shall be established based on an ambient value of 100 ug/L. Where such\nstandards or guidance values are 100 ug/L or greater, they shall not be\nincluded in the total. (c) Groundwater effluent limitations. (1)\n\nGroundwater effluent limitations are\nprovided in Table 3 of section\n703.6\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. For those substances not included in Table 3 of section\n703.6\n(e) of this\n\nTitle and for which a guidance value has been derived as provided in section\n702.15\n(a) or\nsection\n702.15\n(f) of this\n\nPart, the groundwater effluent limitation shall be equal to the guidance\nvalue. (2)\n\nWhen implementing a\ngroundwater effluent limitation, the department may take into account factors, including but not limited to analytical detectability and\ntreatability. (3)\n\nWhere these\nfactors indicate that achieving a groundwater effluent limitation as set forth\nin paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision would be clearly unreasonable, the department may substitute a modified effluent limitation. (4)\nA groundwater effluent limitation for the\ntotal of organic substances that have a groundwater standard in Table 1 of\nsection\n703.5\n(f) of this\n\nTitle or a groundwater guidance value derived pursuant to section\n702.15\n(a) of this\n\nPart shall be established at 100 ug/L. However, substances that have a\ngroundwater standard or guidance value or groundwater effluent limitation of\n100 ug/L or greater shall not be included in this total. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n702.16\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
