  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2202.3 - Grounds for increase of maximum rent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThis section and sections 2202.4 to\n2202.12, inclusive, of this Part\nset forth specific standards for the increase of a maximum rent. In applying\nthese standards and issuing an order adjusting a maximum rent, the\nadministrator shall take into consideration all factors bearing on the equities\ninvolved, subject to the general limitation that the adjustment can be put into\neffect without dislocation and hardship inconsistent with the purposes of the\n\nRent Law. On or after November 22, 1963, where any housing accommodations were\nvacated other than by voluntary surrender of possession or in the manner\nprovided by Part 2204 of this Title, the administrator may, after having due\nregard to the equities involved, bar adjustments of maximum rents for any and\nall accommodations in such structure, pursuant to section\n2202.4\n(b) and (c)\nof this Part, except for work which: (i) is\nnecessary in order to remove violations against the property; (ii)\nis necessary to obtain a certificate of\noccupancy, if such certificate is required by law; or\n(iii)\ncould have been performed with a tenant\nin physical possession of the housing accommodation at the time that the work\nwas performed. (2)\n\nThe\nadministrator shall have the power to revoke or modify any adjustment granted\nhereunder if there has been a substantial change in the basis upon which such\nadjustment was granted. (b) (1)\n\nNo\napplication for an increase in any maximum rent may be filed under section\n2202.8, 2202.9 or\n2202.10\nof this Part, unless: (i) a report of search issued by a city\nagency having jurisdiction is annexed to such applications, stating either that\nno violations against such property are recorded or that all violations\nrecorded against such property have been cleared, corrected or abated, or a\nreceipt (or photocopy thereof) issued by such agency attesting to the payment\nof the fee for the report of search; and\n(ii)\nthe landlord certifies that he is\nmaintaining all essential services required to be furnished, and that he will\ncontinue to maintain such services so long as such increase in the maximum rent\ncontinues in effect. (2)\n\nNo new maximum rent shall be established pursuant to section\n2201.4\nof this Title, and no\nadjustment shall be made pursuant to section\n2201.5\n(a) of this\n\nTitle, unless the landlord has certified that he is maintaining all essential\nservices required to be maintained with respect to the housing accommodations\ncovered by such certification, and that he will continue to maintain such\nservices so long as the new maximum rent or the adjustment is in effect. For\npurposes of this paragraph, essential services shall be defined as: heat during\nthat part of the year when required by law, hot water, cold water, superintendent services, maintenance of front or entrance door security\n(including but not limited to lock and buzzer), garbage collection, elevator\nservice, gas, electricity and other utility services to both public and\nrequired private areas, and such other services wherein failure to provide\nand/or maintain such would constitute a danger to the life or safety of, or\nwould be detrimental to the health of, the tenant or tenants. Upon a\ndetermination that such essential services are not, or were not, being\nmaintained, the Division of Housing and Community Renewal may revoke or modify\nthe new maximum rent established pursuant to section\n2201.4\nof this Title and/or an\nadjustment made pursuant to subdivision (a) of section\n2201.5, and may direct a refund to\nthe tenants of all or part of the increase paid by the tenants as a result of\nany such order or orders. Each such certification filed in connection with an\nadjustment pursuant to section\n2201.5\nof this Title shall be\naccompanied by a certification by the landlord that he has actually expended or\nincurred 90 percent of the total amount of the allowance for operating and\nmaintenance expenses, including the rents collectible from housing\naccommodations in the property. (c) Except as provided in subdivision (g) of\nthis section and section\n2202.19\nof this Part, no landlord\nshall be entitled to an increase in the maximum rent on any ground unless he\ncertifies that he is maintaining all essential services furnished or required\nto be furnished as of the date of the issuance of the order adjusting the\nmaximum rent, and that he will continue to maintain such services so long as\nthe increase in such maximum rent continues in effect; nor shall any landlord\nbe entitled to any increase in maximum rent on any ground where an agency of\nthe city having jurisdiction certifies that the housing accommodation is a fire\nhazard, or is in a continued dangerous condition or detrimental to life or\nhealth or is occupied in violation of law; nor shall any landlord be entitled\nto any increase where the landlord has not removed the violation recorded\nagainst such property as shown in the report of search required under\nsubdivision (b) of this section. (d) (1)\n\nNo\nmore than one order adjusting the maximum rent for any housing accommodation\nunder section\n2202.8\nof this Part may be issued\nin any 24-month period and, except as provided in section\n2202.8\nof this Part, the adjustment\ngranted by any such order shall not exceed 15 percent. (2)\n\nAny adjustment pursuant to section\n2220.8, 2202.9 or\n2202.10\nof this Part, shall be\ncollectible only to the extent permitted by section\n2201.6\nof this Title; provided\nthat, in ordering an adjustment pursuant to section\n2202.8, the administrator may waive\nsuch limitation where a greater increase is necessary to make the earned income\nof the property equal to its operating expenses. (c) That portion of the amount of increase\ncomputed under sections 2202.8 through\n2202.11\nof this Part, as is\nproperly attributable to the controlled housing accommodations, shall be\napportioned among them in the manner prescribed in section\n2201.4\nof this Title for the\napportionment of the maximum gross building rental. Each controlled housing\naccommodation shall bear no more than that portion of the amount of increase as\nis properly attributable to such housing accommodation, whether or not the\namount so attributed shall be fully collectible by reason of an existing lease\nor, in the case of an adjustment pursuant to section\n2202.8, 2202.9 or\n2202.10\nof this Part, by reason of\nthe limitations provided in section\n2201.6\nof this Title. (f) (1)\n\nAny\nlandlord may file an application to increase the maximum rent otherwise\nallowable, on forms prescribed by the administrator, only on one or more of the\ngrounds stated in sections 2202.4 through\n2202.12\nof this Part. (2)\n\nAny landlord may file an application to\nestablish the maximum rents to be effective January 1, 1972, pursuant to\nsection Y51-5.0a(3) of the Rent Law, on forms provided by the administrator, on\nor before the date prescribed by the administrator, and provided that such\napplication shall be accompanied by a fee in the sum of $5 per rent-controlled\nhousing accommodation, based on the number of such accommodations stated in the\ncity report form R-23 filed for the subject building or, if the owner failed to\nprovide this data in the form filed, on the basis of the number of housing\naccommodations (whether or not subject to control pursuant to these\nregulations) shown on the records of the Department of Buildings. (g) Where an application for an\nincrease in any maximum rent is filed under section\n2202.4\n(b) and/or\n(c), and section\n2202.8, 2202.9 or\n2202.10\nof this Part, and the\nlandlord is not entitled to any increase by reason of the provisions of\nsubdivision (b) of this section, the administrator may waive such provision and\nissue orders increasing the maximum rent effective as of the date of issuance\nof such orders; provided, however, that the landlord agrees in writing to\ndeposit the entire amount of such increase in maximum rent into an escrow or\ntrust account administered by the administrator in accordance with procedures\nadopted by the administrator for the purpose of obtaining compliance with the\nprovisions of subdivision (b) of this section, and further agrees to obtain and\nsubmit to the administrator, within one year from the date of issuance of such\norders, a report of search issued by the city agency having jurisdiction, stating that the violations shown in the report of search required under\nsubdivision (b) of this section have been removed, cleared, corrected or\nabated, and his own certification that he is maintaining and will continue to\nmaintain all essential services in accordance with the provisions of\nsubdivision (c) of this section. In the event the landlord fails to fully\ncomply with such provision within one year from the date of the issuance of the\norders increasing the maximum rent, the administrator may, having due regard\nfor the equities involved, revoke such orders and direct full refund to the\ntenants of the entire increase paid by the tenants as a result of such\norders. (h) If, at least six months\nbefore the effective date of the establishment of new maximum rents pursuant to\nsection\n2201.4\nof this Title, or an\nadjustment of maximum rents pursuant to section\n2201.5\n(a), the\nlandlord has not certified to the Department of Rent and Housing Maintenance\nthat (1) all rent-impairing violations (as defined in section\n302-a\nof the Multiple Dwelling Law), and (2) at least 80 percent of all other\nviolations of the Housing Maintenance Code or Multiple Dwelling Law that were\nrecorded against the property one year prior to such effective date have been\ncleared, corrected or abated, such new maximum rents or such adjustment shall\nnot take effect until he shall have entered into a written agreement with such\ndepartment to deposit income derived from the property into an escrow or trust\naccount as prescribed in such agreement for the purpose of correction of such\nviolations.
