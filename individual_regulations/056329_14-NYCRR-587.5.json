Tit. 14 § 587.5 - Certification\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A provider of\nservice intending to operate an outpatient program must obtain an initial\noperating certificate issued by the Office of Mental Health in accordance with\nprocedures established in Part 551 of this Title. Renewals of such operating\ncertificates shall be issued for terms of up to three years, unless the Office\nof Mental Health shall deem that a term less than three years is\nappropriate. (b) Each outpatient\nprogram site shall be authorized by a separate operating certificate. The\noperating certificate shall specify for each site: (1)\nthe program type to be\noperated; (2)\nthe location of the\nprogram; (3)\nthe hours of operation\nof the program; (4)\nthe program\ncapacity for continuing day treatment, partial hospitalization and intensive\npsychiatric rehabilitation treatment programs; (5)\nthe population to be served; (6)\nthe term of the operating certificate; and\n(7)\nany approved optional\nservices to be provided. (c) Each outpatient program authorized by an\noperating certificate pursuant to this Part shall be clearly identifiable. Each\noutpatient program shall have separately identifiable staff, space and program\npolicies and procedures. (d) The\ncounty director of community services shall be responsible for identifying\nspecific licensed clinic treatment programs to be designated by the\ncommissioner as interim specialty clinic programs serving children in\naccordance with the identified need within the county. In making such\nidentification, the county director of community services shall use the\nfollowing criteria: (1)\n\nAll licensed\nsatellites of a recommended provider in the same county shall be included if so\ndesignated by the commissioner. New York City is one county for such\npurposes. (2)\nA county with less\nthan one percent of children in New York State, as defined in accordance with\nsection\n587.4\n(a)(4) and\n(8)\nof this Part, may have up to two\ndesignated providers. If only one licensed clinic is included on the\nrecommended list, the county director of community services may recommend a\nsecond licensed clinic without recent Medicaid experience serving children. The\n\nOffice of Mental Health may approve these recommendations based upon competence\nof a licensed clinic treatment program to serve such children and upon\naccessibility to the clinic by such children. Accessibility shall be based upon\na geographic area rather than a catchment area of the recommended licensed\nclinic treatment program. (3)\nA\ncounty with at least one percent and less than three percent of the projected\nnumber of children in New York State, as defined in accordance with section\n587.4\n(a)(4) and\n(8)\nof this Part, may recommend up to six\nlicensed clinic treatment programs including all licensed satellites of such\nrecommended providers. (4)\nA county\nwith at least three percent and less than eight percent of the children in New\n\nYork State, as defined in accordance with section\n587.4\n(a)(4) and\n(8)\nof this Part, may recommend up to 10\nlicensed clinic treatment programs. (5)\n\nThe City of New York may recommend up to\n85 licensed clinic treatment programs. (6)\n\nNew York City may reallocate the total\nnumber of licensed clinics of the five boroughs which appear on the recommended\nlist amongst the five boroughs. However, no more than the total number of\nlicensed clinic treatment programs which appear on the list for the five\nboroughs shall be designated as interim specialty clinic treatment programs\nserving children. (e) The commissioner shall designate a licensed clinic treatment program to provide\ninterim specialty children's services to children as defined in accordance with\nsection\n587.4\n(a) of this\n\nPart.

Such\na clinic shall be designated as an interim specialty clinic treatment program\nserving children and shall operate in accordance with section\n587.9\nof this Part and Part 588 of\nthis Title. An interim specialty clinic treatment program serving children\nshall be determined to meet at least one of the following criteria: (1)\n\nIn a county with less than three percent\nof the projected population of children in New York State, as defined in\nsection\n587.4\n(a) of this\n\nPart, the criteria for inclusion as a designated interim specialty clinic\ntreatment program serving children includes: (i) any licensed clinic treatment program, including all licensed satellite locations within the county, that had total\n\nMedicaid visits by children exceeding 400 visits annually for the most recent\ncompleted State fiscal year; or\n(ii)\nany one licensed clinic treatment\nprogram location which had more than 200 Medicaid visits by children\nrepresenting more than 75 percent of total Medicaid volume of visits at that\nlocation; or\n(iii)\nall licensed\nclinic treatment programs in a county with two or fewer clinic treatment\nprograms serving children; or\n(iv)\nall county-operated clinic treatment programs serving children.
