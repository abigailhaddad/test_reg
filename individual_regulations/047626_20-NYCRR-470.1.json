Tit. 20 § 470.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 502\n(a) The highway use tax and the additional\nhighway use tax, commonly referred to as the truck mileage tax and the fuel use\ntax, respectively, are administered by the Miscellaneous Tax Bureau for the\n\nState Tax Commission. The address of this bureau, to which applications for\npermits, returns and correspondence should be addressed or delivered is: State\n\nTax Commission, Miscellaneous Tax Bureau, State Campus, Albany, N.Y. 12227. (b) (1)\n\nAs part of the administration of the\ntruck mileage tax and the fuel use tax, article 21 of the Tax Law requires that\na highway use tax permit be obtained from the State Tax Commission for every\nmotor vehicle as defined in such statute, with specified exceptions (see\nsections\n471.1\n-471.6\nof this Article). Every such motor vehicle must have a permit whether it is\nregistered in New York or in any other state and regardless of whether it is\nengaged in intrastate or interstate commerce. (2)\n\nEffective September 1, 1982 every motor\nvehicle transporting automotive fuel, other than a tractor or other\nself-propelled device which transports the motor vehicle holding automotive\nfuel, in New York State must have a special highway use permit and a\ndistinctively colored sticker (see section\n473.7\n(c) of this Article) in place of the permit required by paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (c) It is\nunlawful to operate such motor vehicle on any public highway of this State, including any portion of the New York State Thruway for which a charge is made, without this permit. However, a trailer or other device drawn by a\nself-propelled device, if operated exclusively on those portions of the New\n\nYork State Thruway for which a charge is made, may operate without this permit. For the purpose of the truck mileage tax, no portion of the New York State\n\nThruway for which a charge is made, need be included in mileage subject to that\ntax. (d) Any street, avenue, road, public place, public driveway or any other public way within any town, village\nor city in the State is a\npublic highway. (e) As used in this Subchapter, a reference\nto a highway use tax plate shall, during the period that the highway use tax\nstickers are provided for by the provisions of this Subchapter, mean and\ninclude such highway use tax stickers.
