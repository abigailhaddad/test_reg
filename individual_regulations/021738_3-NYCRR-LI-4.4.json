  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.4 - Procedure for converting a regular savings account to a date of deposit-date of withdrawal status\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department received a number of inquiries regarding the\nproper procedure for savings banks and savings and loan associations to follow\nin transferring accounts from regular savings status to date of deposit--date\nof withdrawal (DOD/DOW) status. The department stated its position as\nfollows: The proper procedure and the procedure which the department\nrecommends to all institutions requires the depositor to take some affirmative\naction to precipitate an account change. A bank may take the initiative by\ncontacting its depositors either by means of a newspaper advertisement or by\nletter, and advising them that it is prepared to make the account transfer if\nit receives a written request to do so. The department does not regard it as proper for a bank to\nmake an account transfer without notifying the depositor or after notifying a\ndepositor that the transfer will be made unless the bank is directed not to do\nso. This approach is regarded as unsound because of possible breach of the\ndeposit contract and because of the risk of the bank finding itself with no\nregular savings accounts (which accounts it is required to maintain under\nsection 245 [3-b] if it is to have DOD/DOW accounts). DATED: March 18, 1970\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 4.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
