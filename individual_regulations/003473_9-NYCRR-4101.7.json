Tit. 9 § 4101.7 - Certification of annual expenditures for enhancements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pursuant to section 318 of the Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law, the commission shall certify to the\n\nCommissioner of Taxation and Finance no later than 80 days after the close of\neach calendar year the name of each harness racing association or corporation, that has failed during the immediately preceding calendar year to expend an\namount equal to at least one-half of one percent of such association or\ncorporation's on-track bets for enhancements consisting of capital improvements\nas defined in section 319 of such law (and section\n4101.6\nof this Part), repairs to\nsuch association or corporation's physical plant, structures and equipment used\nin its racing or wagering operations and costs connected with no more than five\nspecial events as defined in section 318 of such law and approved by the\ncommission. (b) In this connection, each harness racing association or corporation shall by January 31st of the\ncurrent year file with the commission schedules of expenditures made during the\nimmediately preceding calendar year segregated by expenditures for capital\nimprovements, eligible repairs and special events. Such schedules shall be in\nsummary form identifying each asset or special event, as applicable, by\nappropriate name, the total expended for each asset or special event, and the\ndate of completion for use for such asset or, if special event, the date it was\nheld. Copies of bills, invoices and other supporting documentation providing\ndetails of such expenditures shall be retained by the track for audit by the\ncommission. (c) To qualify as\neligible repairs, expenditures must be for work or materials necessary to put\ninoperative assets back into good operating condition; in addition, the\nreplacement of parts, the fixing of plant, overhaul of equipment, and similar\nwork that ordinarily would not qualify as capital expenditures because the life\nof the asset is not thereby extended shall nevertheless qualify as eligible\nrepairs. Maintenance expenditures incurred for the purpose of keeping assets in\noperating condition are excluded. (d) In determining whether the necessary\namounts have been expended, the commission shall consider the immediately\npreceding calendar year or the average of the two immediately preceding\ncalendar years, whichever is higher, for all tracks located outside Westchester\nor Nassau Counties; for a track located in Westchester or Nassau County, only\nthe average of the two immediately preceding years shall be considered. It\nshall be presumed that only expenditures submitted in the form required in\nsubdivision (b) of this section are expenditures qualified for consideration by\nthe commission. (e) If the\ncommission determines that such racing association or corporation has failed to\nmake the total of expenditures as established by statute it shall notify the\naffected association or corporation thereof by February 20th of the current\nyear and schedule a date within 15 days to hear the association or corporation\nin regard to the commission's determination. (f) Copies of any certification made in\naccordance with subdivision (a) of this section shall be served upon the\naffected association or corporation by the date prescribed in such subdivision\n(a).
