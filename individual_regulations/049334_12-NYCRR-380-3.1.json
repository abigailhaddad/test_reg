  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 380-3.1 - Employee notice requirements for paid family leave\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Foreseeable leave. An employee must provide the employer with at least 30\ndays advance notice before leave is to begin if the qualifying event is\nforeseeable. Foreseeable qualifying events include an expected birth, placement\nfor adoption or foster care; planned medical treatment for a serious health\ncondition of a family member; the planned medical treatment for a serious\ninjury or illness of a covered service member; or other known military\nexigency. If 30 days advance notice is not practicable for reasons such as a\nlack of knowledge of approximately when leave will be required to begin, a\nchange in circumstances, or a medical emergency, notice must be given as soon\nas practicable. The employee shall advise the employer as soon as practicable\nif dates of scheduled leave change or are extended, or were initially\nunknown. (b) (1)\n\nWhen the approximate timing of the\nqualifying event and need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee shall\nprovide notice to the employer as soon as practicable under the facts and\ncircumstances of the qualifying event. It generally should be practicable for\nthe employee to provide notice of leave that is unforeseeable within the time\nprescribed by the employer's usual and customary notice requirements applicable\nto such leave. (2)\n\nAs soon as\npracticable means as soon as both possible and practical, taking into account\nall of the facts and circumstances in the individual case. When an employee\nbecomes aware of a qualifying event less than 30 days in advance, it should be\npracticable for the employee to provide notice of the need for leave either the\nsame day or the next business day. In all cases, however, the determination of\nwhen an employee could practicably provide notice must take into account the\nindividual facts and circumstances surrounding the qualifying event. (c) Intermittent\nleave. When an employee takes intermittent family leave the\nemployer may require the employee to provide notice as soon as is practicable\nbefore each day of intermittent leave. (d) An employer may waive the notice\nrequirements contained in subdivision (a) of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
