  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 201.3 - Investment guidelines for public authorities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every public authority referred to in\nsection\n201.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart shall comply with the investment guideline requirements set forth in\nsubdivision (c) of this section. (b) Every public authority referred to in\nsection\n201.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart shall require its independent auditor to review the public authority's\ninvestment policies and practices to determine whether: (1)\nthe public authority complied with\napplicable laws, regulations and the State Comptroller's investment guideline\nrequirements set forth in this section; (2)\nthe public authority complied with its\nown investment policies; (3)\ninvestment assets were adequately safeguarded; (4)\nadequate accounts and records were\nmaintained which accurately reflect all transactions, including a report on the\ndisposition of public authority investment assets; and\n(5)\na system of adequate internal controls\nwas maintained. (c) (1)\n\nInvestment guideline requirements. These\ninvestment guideline requirements are intended to guide public authorities in: (i) establishing a prudent set of basic\nprocedures to meet the individual investment objectives of each public\nauthority; (ii)\nassuring that\ninvestment assets are adequately safeguarded and collateralized; (iii)\nestablishing and maintaining a system\nof internal controls including adequate accounts and records, which accurately\nreflect in reasonable detail, investment transactions; and\n(iv)\nproviding for accurate reporting and\nevaluation of investment results in conformance with accounting principles\ngenerally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). (2)\n(i) All\npublic authorities referred to in section\n201.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart are required to comply with these investment guideline requirements. These\nguideline requirements contain certain fundamental principles and standards for\nthe administration of an investment program. An investment program involving\npublic funds must include four basic ingredients - legality, safety, liquidity\nand reasonable return. Section\n2925\nof\nthe Public Authorities Law also requires public authorities to develop\ninvestment guidelines that meet certain basic requirements. (ii)\n\nBecause of the vast differences in the\nsize and operations of public authorities and in the scope of their investment\nportfolios, these guideline requirements are intended to represent only minimum\nstandards and be sufficiently broad to apply in most investment situations. It\nis the responsibility of each public authority to determine and evaluate its\nown risks in all its investment transactions with due regard to prudent\nbusiness principles and practices. The governing body and management of a\npublic authority are responsible for making investment decisions for the public\nauthority and for doing so with the judgment, care, skill, prudence and\ndiligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a knowledgeable and\nprudent investor acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would\nuse in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims. While individual public authorities are authorized to establish different\nsystems and procedures that meet their specific needs in administering their\ninvestment programs, it is expected that all public authorities will meet the\nminimum standards contained in these guideline requirements. No departure from\nthese guideline requirements may create an exception from a requirement imposed\nby law and every departure from these guideline requirements must be formally\napproved by a resolution of the governing body of the public authority, and a\ncopy of such resolution shall be submitted to the Office of Budget and Policy\n\nAnalysis of the Office of the State Comptroller not less than 30 days after the\nadoption of such resolution. (iii)\n\nPublic authority investments must be made in accordance with legal\nrequirements: (a) set forth in the statute\nwhich created a particular public authority, the Public Authorities Law or any\nother applicable law; and\n(b) prescribed by the State Comptroller, the New York State Public Authorities\n\nControl Board or any other officer or entity having the authority to supervise\nor approve the activities of a public authority. (c) In addition, investments must be\nadequately protected and deposits of money should be fully collateralized. The\nfinancial resources of the public authority should be properly managed to\nachieve investment income consistent with sound investment practice. The\nfollowing provisions contain the essential elements that are generally\nrecognized and accepted for the effective management and control of\ninvestments. (3)\n\nInvestment policy. (i) Each public authority shall have a\nwritten investment policy approved by its governing body. Members of the\ngoverning body shall take an active role in the formulation of the investment\npolicy. The investment policy shall be reviewed periodically (at least\nannually) and revised as necessary to reflect changes in available investment\nopportunities and market conditions or as a result of any recommendations from\nthe periodic evaluation of the performance of the investment program or any\naudits of the investment program. (ii)\n\nThe governing body may wish to delegate\nthe formulation of the investment policy to an investment committee of the\ngoverning body. In addition to formulating the investment policy, functions to\nbe performed by the investment committee shall include, but not be limited to, evaluating the investment program by: (a) monitoring the system of internal controls; (b) verifying relevant matters relating to\nthe securities purchased or held as collateral at least semi-annually and on an\nunscheduled basis; (c) determining\nthat the investment results are consistent with the governing body's\nobjectives; and\n(d) reviewing any\nindependent audits of the investment program. (iii)\n\nInvestment policies shall include the\nfollowing: (a) Investment objectives and types\nof investment authorized. The primary investment objective of public entities\nis protection of principal. The investment policy shall contain a detailed list\nof the permitted investments which shall be consistent with the appropriate\nprovisions of the law relating to the public authority, provisions of\napplicable note and bond resolutions and special policy directives of the\ngoverning body. (b) Diversification\nof investments. The investment policy shall include standards for the\ndiversification of investments, both with respect to type of investment and\nfirms with which the public authority transacts business. Diversification\npolicies shall also address the term of each investment. (c) Delegation of investment management. All\ninvestment transactions shall be reviewed and approved by those officials\ndesignated by the governing body. The investment policy shall list persons who\nare authorized to make investment decisions and shall limit the number of\npersons who may place orders. In some cases the State laws governing the\noperations of a public authority may designate an official outside of the\npublic authority, such as the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, to be the\nfiscal agent for the public authority and to invest public authority moneys not\nrequired for immediate use. Such a delegation does not relieve the public\nauthority from the responsibility of overseeing the investment program, since\nultimately the governing body is responsible for the management and\nsafeguarding of all the public authority assets entrusted in its\ncare. (d) Internal control and\nprocedures. The investment policy shall include provisions requiring the\ninvestment officer to establish and maintain an internal control structure\ndesigned to ensure that the investment assets of the public authority are\nprotected from loss, theft or misuse. The internal control structure shall be\ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance that these objectives are met. The\nconcept of reasonable assurance recognizes that the cost of a control should\nnot exceed the benefits likely to be derived from the control and that the\nvaluation of costs and benefits requirements estimates and judgments by\nmanagement. Accordingly, the investment officer shall establish a process for\nan annual independent review by an independent auditor to assure compliance\nwith policies and procedures. The internal controls shall address the\nfollowing: (1)\ncontrol of collusion; (2)\nseparation of transaction authority from\naccounting and recordkeeping; (3)\ncustodial safekeeping; (4)\navoidance of physical delivery securities; (5)\nclear delegation of authority to\nsubordinate staff members; (6)\nconfirmation of transactions for investments and wire transfers; and\n(7)\nwire transfer agreements. (e) Selection of investment firms. An approved list of financial institutions shall be established for each type\nof investment based on applicable law and upon the qualifications of investment\nbankers, brokers, agents, dealers and other investment advisors and agents\nwhich transact business with the public authority. In addition a list shall\nalso be maintained of approved security broker/dealers selected by\ncreditworthiness (e.g., a minimum capital requirement of $10,000,000 and at\nleast five years of operation). These may include \"primary\" dealers or regional\ndealers that qualify under Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Rule 15C3-1\n(uniform net capital rule). All financial institutions and broker/dealers who\ndesire to become qualified for investment transactions must supply the\nfollowing as appropriate: (1)\naudited\nfinancial statements; (2)\nproof of\n\nNational Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) certification; (3)\nproof of state registration; (4)\ncompleted broker/dealer questionnaire, in\nthe form adopted by the public authority. (f) Investment procedures and contracts. The\npublic authority's investment guidelines shall include procedures for each\ninvestment or transaction. Such procedures shall include provisions: (1)\ndeemed necessary and sufficient to secure\nin a satisfactory manner the public authority's financial interest in each\ninvestment; (2)\ncovering the use, type and amount of collateral or insurance for investments requiring\ncollateralization; (3)\nestablishing\na method of valuation of collateral, and procedures for monitoring the\nvaluation of such collateral on a regular basis and obtaining additional\ncollateral when necessary to adequately secure collateralized investments; and\n(4)\nfor the monitoring, control, deposit, and retention of investments and collateral which shall\ninclude, in the case of a repurchase agreement, a requirement that the\nobligations purchased be physically delivered for retention to the public\nauthority or its agent (which shall not be an agent of the party with whom the\npublic authority enters into such repurchase agreement), unless such\nobligations are issued in book-entry form, in which case the public authority\nshall take such other action as may be necessary to obtain title to or a\nperfected security interest in such obligations. The investment guidelines shall include a requirement that\nthe public authority enter into a written contract for each investment, the\nprovisions of which cover the items set forth in subclauses (1) through (4) of\nthis clause. If the public authority shall determine by resolution that a\nwritten contract is not practical or that there is not a regular business\npractice of written contracts with respect to a specific investment or\ntransaction, the procedures prescribed for that type of investment shall\nnonetheless adhere to subclauses (1) through (4) of this clause. (g) Collateralization. The investment policy shall include provisions and procedures to fully secure\nor collateralize the public authority's financial interest in investments\nrequiring security or collateralization, provided that the policy may include a\ndescription of the circumstances under which the public authority's financial\ninterest in investments may be less than fully secured or collateralized. The\ncollateral for investments shall be limited to obligations having the same\nratings as or higher ratings than the ratings of the obligations permissible\nfor the public authority's direct investments. The collateral shall be\nsegregated in the public authority's name and shall be in the custody of the\npublic authority or a third party custodian. The public authority shall not\naccept a pledge of a proportionate interest in a pool of collateral. For demand\ndeposits, time deposits and certificates of deposit, collateralization is\nrequired for amounts over and above Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\ncoverage. The market value and the accrued interest of the collateral shall\nequal the value of the investment and any accrued interest at all times. The\nrecorded value of the collateral backing any investment shall be compared with\ncurrent market values (mark-to-market) at the time of initial investment, and\nthereafter at least monthly (or more often if the public authority determines\nthat volatile market conditions require more frequent valuation), to be certain\nthat it continues to be at least equal to the value of the investment plus\naccrued interest. The mark-to-market reviews shall use \"bid\" price from one\nconstant source. It may be desirable to require collateralization in excess of\nthe market value at the time of purchase. There shall be a written custodial\nagreement which, among other things, specifies the circumstances under which\ncollateral may be substituted and provides that the custodian is holding the\nsecurities solely for the benefit of the public authority and makes no claim\nthereto. (h) Performance evaluation\nand audit. The investment policy shall provide for the systematic and periodic\nevaluation of investment program compliance. This function may be performed by\nthe governing body itself or assigned to the investment committee or the\ninternal or external auditors. Section\n2925\n(3)(f)\nof the Public Authorities Law requires\neach public authority to have an annual independent audit of all\ninvestments. (i) Reporting. The\ninvestment policy shall explicitly require periodic reporting on the investment\nprogram including: (1)\n\nInternal management\nreporting. There shall be periodic (at least quarterly) reporting to the\ngoverning body on the investment program operations. Such reporting provides an\neffective tool for evaluating investment program compliance. Section\n2925\n(5)\nof the Public Authorities Law requires\neach public authority to have prepared and filed with the governing body\nquarterly reports or reports covering such other period as may be approved by\nthe governing body. The report or reports, from a designated officer or\nemployee must indicate any new investments, the inventory of existing\ninvestments and the selection of investment bankers, brokers, agents, dealers, or auditors. (2)\n\nFinancial\nstatements. The public authority's annual basic financial statements, which are\nrequired to be prepared in conformance with accounting principles generally\naccepted in the United States of America (GAAP), shall contain all note\ndisclosures on deposits with financial institutions and investments required by\nthe Governmental Accounting Standards Board (GASB) for the period covered by\nthe basic financial statements. GASB has issued numerous Statements, Interpretations and Technical Bulletins establishing and clarifying investment\nreporting and disclosure requirements. Public authorities shall review and\napply these standards and guidance as appropriate and in compliance with the\nrequirements of this Part and such public authority accounting directives as\nmay be issued by the State Comptroller. (3)\n\nReporting to oversight agencies. Section\n2925\n(6)\nof the Public Authorities Law requires\npublic authorities to submit an annual investment report. Section\n2925\n(7)(a)\nof the Public Authorities Law requires\neach public authority, a majority of the members of which consist of persons\nappointed by the Governor or who serve as members by virtue of holding a civil\noffice of the State, or a combination thereof, to submit the annual investment\nreport to the Division of the Budget with copies to the Office of the State\n\nComptroller, the Senate Finance Committee, and the Assembly Ways and Means\n\nCommittee. Section\n2925\n(7)(b)\nof the Public Authorities Law requires\neach public authority, a majority of the members of which does not consist of\npersons appointed by the Governor or who serve as members by virtue of holding\na civil office of the State, or a combination thereof, to submit the annual\ninvestment report to the chief executive officer and chief fiscal officer of\neach municipality for the benefit of which it was created and to the Office of\nthe State Comptroller. Such report shall include: (i) the investment guidelines required by\n\nPublic Authorities Law, section 2925(3) and any amendments to such guidelines\nsince the last investment report; (ii)\nan explanation of the investment\nguidelines and amendments; (iii)\nthe results of the annual independent audit; (iv)\nthe investment income record of the\npublic authority; and\n(v) a list of\nthe total fees, commissions or other charges paid to each investment banker, broker, agent, dealer and advisor rendering investment associated services to\nthe public authority since the last investment report. (4)\n\nOperating procedures. Operating\nprocedures for the administration of an investment program shall include the\nfollowing: (i) The investment selection\nprocess shall utilize competitive quotations or negotiated prices, except in\nthe purchase of Federal government securities at auction. (ii)\n\nEach disbursement of funds (and\ncorresponding receipt of securities) or delivery of securities (and\ncorresponding receipt of funds) shall be based upon proper written\nauthorization. If the authorization is initially given verbally, there shall be\nwritten confirmation from the investment officer to the custodian. (iii)\n\nPayment of funds shall only be made\nupon delivery of securities. (iv)\n\nThe process of initiating, reviewing and approving requests to buy and sell\ninvestments shall be documented and retained for audit purposes. (v) Custodians must have prior authorization\nfrom the public authority to deliver obligations and collateral. Delivery of\nobligations sold shall only be made upon receipt of funds. (vi)\n\nCustodial banks shall be required to\nreport monthly or more frequently on activity occurring in the public\nauthority's custodial account. (vii)\n\nThere shall be at least monthly\nverifications of both the principal amount and the market values of all\ninvestments and collateral. Appropriate listings shall be obtained from the\ncustodian and compared against the public authority's records. (viii)\nA record of investments shall be\nmaintained by the investment officer. The records shall identify the security, the fund for which held, the place where kept, date of disposition and amount\nrealized, if required, and the market value and custodian of\ncollateral. (5)\n\nProcedures for repurchase agreements. Great care must be exercised by those\npublic authorities that invest in repurchase agreements. Because repurchase\nagreements may expose investors to serious risks, the following procedures\nshall be followed to reduce those risks: (i) Repurchase agreements shall only be purchased from banks or trust companies\nauthorized to do business in the State of New York or from broker dealers on\nthe Federal Reserve Bank of New York's list of primary government securities\ndealers. (ii)\n\nRepurchase agreements\nshall be for no more than 90 days. Agreements which are \"open\" (continuing in\nnature) shall not be made. (iii)\n\nThe public authority shall execute a master repurchase agreement with each\nbroker dealer which outlines the basic rights of both buyer and seller\nincluding: (A)\nthe events of default which\nwould permit the purchaser to liquidate the pledged collateral; (B)\nthe relationship between parties to the\nagreement, which shall ordinarily be purchaser and seller; (C)\nprocedures which ensure that the public\nauthority obtains a perfected security interest in the securities which are the\nsubject of the agreement; (D)\nthe\nmethod of computing margin maintenance requirements and providing for timely\ncorrection of margin deficiencies or excesses. Specific guidelines regarding\nmargin maintenance shall be established, taking into consideration: (I)\nthe type of collateral; (II)\nthe maturity of the\ncollateral; (III)\nthe method by\nwhich additional margin will be maintained; and\n(E)\ncircumstances, if any, under which\nsubstitution of securities subject to the agreement shall be\npermitted. (iv)\n\nThe\npublic authority or its custodian must take possession of the securities being\npurchased by physical delivery or book entry. The custodian shall not be the\nsame party that is selling the securities to the public authority. (v) A custodial bank shall be a member of the\n\nFederal Reserve Bank or maintain accounts with member banks to accomplish\nbook-entry transfer of securities to the credit of the public\nauthority. (6)\n\nIndependent audit considerations. (i) Section\n2925\n(3)(f)\nof the Public Authorities Law requires\neach public authority to have an annual independent audit of all investments. The annual investment audit: (A)\nshall\ndetermine whether: the public authority complies with its own investment\npolicies; investment assets are adequately safeguarded; adequate accounts and\nrecords are maintained which accurately reflect all transactions and report on\nthe disposition of public authority investment assets; and a system of adequate\ninternal controls is maintained; (B)\nshall determine whether the public\nauthority complied with the applicable laws, regulations, the State\n\nComptroller's investment guideline requirements set forth in this subdivision, and such public authority accounting directives as may be issued by the State\n\nComptroller; and\n(C)\nshall be\ndesigned to the extent practical to satisfy both the common interests of the\npublic authority and the public officials accountable to others. (ii)\nA written audit report shall\nbe prepared presenting the results of the annual independent audit of all\ninvestments and shall include: (A)\na\ndescription of the scope and objectives of the audit; (B)\na statement attesting that the audit was\nconducted in accordance with generally accepted government auditing\nstandards; (C)\na description of any\nmaterial weaknesses found in the internal controls; (D)\na description of all non-compliance with\nthe public authority's own investment policies as well as applicable laws, regulations, the State Comptroller's investment guideline requirements for\n\nPublic Authorities set forth in this subdivision, and such public authority\naccounting directives as may be issued by the State Comptroller; (E)\na statement of positive assurance of\ncompliance on the items tested; and\n(F)\na statement on any other material\ndeficiency or finding identified during the audit not covered in subitem (E) of\nthis item. (iii)\n\nThe\naudit report shall be filed within 90 days after the close of the public\nauthority's fiscal year with the Office of Budget and Policy Analysis of the\n\nOffice of the State Comptroller. (7)\n\nEffective date. These investment\nguideline requirements for Public Authorities are effective immediately upon\nthe adoption of this subdivision of the State Comptroller's regulations and\nsupersede the Investment Guidelines for Public Authorities issued by the Office\nof the State Comptroller on January 2, 1998.
