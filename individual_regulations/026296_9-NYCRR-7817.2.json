Tit. 9 § 7817.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor purposes of this Part, the terms hereinafter shall\nhave the following meanings: (a) The\nterm cogeneration facility shall mean any facility with an electric generating\ncapacity of up to 80 megawatts, together with any related facilities located at\nthe same project site, which is fueled by coal, gas, wood, alcohol, solid\nwastes, refuse-derived fuel, water or oil, to the extent any such oil-fueled\nfacility was fueled by oil prior to September 24, 1980 and there is no increase\nin the amount of oil used at the facility, or to the extent oil is used as a\nbackup fuel for such facility, and which simultaneously or sequentially\nproduces either electricity or shaft horsepower and useful thermal\nenergy. (b) The term alternate\nenergy production facility shall mean any solar, wind turbine, waste\nmanagement, resource recovery, refuse-derived fuel or wood-burning facility, together with any related facilities located at the same project site, with an\nelectric generating capacity of up to 80 megawatts, which produces electricity, gas or useful thermal energy. (c) The term small hydro facility shall mean: (1)\nany hydroelectric facility with an electric generating capacity of up to 80\nmegawatts at an existing dam, together with any related facilities located at\nthe same project site; and\n(2)\nany\nhydroelectric facility with an electric generating capacity of up to 21/2\nmegawatts that requires the construction of a new dam, together with any\nrelated facilities located at the same project site; provided, however, such\nterm shall not include any such facility within either the Adirondack Park or\nthe Catskill Park. (d) The term related facilities shall mean any land, work, system, building, improvement, instrumentality or thing necessary or convenient to the\nconstruction, completion or operation of any cogeneration, alternate energy\nproduction or small hydro facility and include also such transmission or\ndistribution facilities as may be necessary to conduct electricity, gas or\nuseful thermal energy to users located at or near a project site. (e) The term waste management facility shall\nmean facilities used for the treatment, processing or land disposal of liquid, semisolid or solid wastes. (f) The\nterm potentially dangerous equipment shall mean the following equipment which\nis an integral part of a cogeneration, small hydro or alternate energy\nproduction or related facility: boilers; gas, wind, water and steam turbines; heat engines; equipment specifically installed for the sole purpose of\nconveying, transmitting or distributing the gas produced at pressures of 2 psig\nor more; pipes specifically installed for the sole purpose of transferring, transmitting or distributing the useful thermal energy produced at temperatures\nexceeding 250° F; electrical generators, transformers, switchgear, substations, conductors and electrical lines specifically installed for the\nsole purpose of transmitting and distributing the electricity produced; stacks\nand air pollution control equipment having exposed surface temperatures\nexceeding 140° F; and supplies of fuel stored for the operation of such\nfacility. (g) The term thermal\nenergy shall mean that heat energy transferred by steam, hot water or other\nheat transfer fluids. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
