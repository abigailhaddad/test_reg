Adjustments may be made to the rate resulting from any final audit findings or reviews. (b) Rates shall be computed on the basis of a full 12 month base year CFR, adjusted in accordance with the methodology as provided in this section. The rate shall include operating cost components, and capital cost components as identified in applicable subdivisions. Such base year may be updated periodically, as determined by the department. (c) Components of rates for ICF/DD services. (1)\n\nThe operating component shall be based on allowable costs identified in the consolidated fiscal reports.

In no case will the total reimbursable depreciation or principal amortization and total interest associated with the capital asset exceed the total acquisition cost, renovation and financing cost associated with a capital asset. (iii)\n\nNotification to providers. 14 NYCRR Subpart\n635-6\ncontains the criteria and standards associated with capital costs and reimbursement. Each provider will receive a schedule of \"prior approved assets\" that is being used to establish the real property capital component of the provider's reimbursement rate. (iv)\n\nInitial rate for capital assets approved on or after July 1, 2014.

Such costs shall be included in the rate as of the date of certification of the site, continuing until such time as actual costs are submitted to the State. Estimated costs shall be submitted in lieu of actual costs for a period no greater than two years. If actual costs are not submitted to the State within two years from the date of site certification, the amount of capital costs included in the rate shall be zero for each period in which actual costs are not submitted. The department may retroactively adjust the capital component. (v) Cost verified rates for capital assets approved on or after July 1, 2014. The provider shall submit to the State supporting documentation of actual costs. Actual costs shall be verified by the State reviewing the supporting documentation of such costs. A provider submitting such actual costs shall certify that the reimbursement requested reflects allowable capital costs and that such costs were actually expended by such provider. Under no circumstances shall the amount included in the rate under this subparagraph exceed the amount authorized in the approval process. Capital costs shall be depreciated over a 25 year period for acquisition of properties or amortized over the life of the lease for leased sites. Capital improvements shall be depreciated over the life of the asset. The amortization of interest shall not exceed the life of the loan taken. Amortization or depreciation shall begin upon certification by the provider of such costs. Start-up costs may be amortized over a one year period beginning with site certification. If actual costs are not submitted to the State within two years from the date of site certification, the amount of capital costs included in the rate shall be zero for each period in which actual costs are not submitted. (vi)\n\nCapital reimbursement reconciliation schedule. Beginning with the cost reporting period ending December 31, 2014, each provider shall submit to OPWDD, as part of the annual cost report, a capital reimbursement reconciliation schedule. This schedule will specifically identify the differences, by capital reimbursement item, between the amounts reported on the certified cost report, and the reimbursable items, including depreciation, interest and lease cost from the schedule of approved reimbursable capital costs. The provider's independent auditor will apply procedures to verify the accuracy and completeness of the capital reimbursement reconciliation schedule. The department will retroactively adjust capital reimbursement based on the actual cost verification process as described in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
