(2)\n\nCollateral contacts may be counted as a\nbillable service for an active child or adolescent client; however, no more\nthan 25 percent of the aggregate contacts may be collateral contacts. Collateral contacts shall not count toward the minimum of two face-to-face\ncontacts which may be considered a billable service pursuant to paragraph\n(b)(2) of this section. (3)\n\nContacts with a group composed of collaterals of more than one child or\nadolescent may be gathered together for the purposes of goal-oriented problem\nsolving, assessment of treatment strategies and the developmental or practical\nskills for assisting the child or adolescent with the management of his or her\nillness; provided, however, that at least one collateral of the client for whom\na billable service is being submitted must be a participant of the\ngroup. (d) Only one\ncontact per day shall be allowed as a billable service; provided, however, that\ntwo contacts per day shall be so allowable if one contact is a face-to-face\ncontact with a child or adolescent client and the other contact is a\nface-to-face contact with a collateral of a child or adolescent client.
