  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 609.8 - Deferred payment agreements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No\ntelephone corporation shall suspend, terminate or refuse to restore or provide\nbasic local exchange service to a residential customer, who has been an\nexisting residential customer for three months and for whom basic local\nexchange service has not been terminated for nonpayment during that period\nbecause of arrears owed on such person's account unless it offers the customer\na deferred payment agreement pursuant to this section. Customers with medical\nemergencies and customers who are elderly, blind or disabled shall be exempt\nfrom such eligibility criteria. However, any such agreement shall not be\navailable to any customer who the commission or its designee determines has the\nresources available to pay his or her bill. The offer of a deferred payment\nagreement shall specify the total amount of arrears, the down payment, the\ninstallment payments and the time for making such payments. The telephone\ncorporation shall mail to the customer not less than six days prior to\ntermination of service, a notice describing to the customer a deferred payment\nplan which shall contain a conspicuous, bold-type notice that the customer may\nobtain the assistance of the commission in reaching an agreement. Where service\nis already terminated pursuant to section\n609.4\nof this Part, such notice\nshall be given at the time the customer requests reconnection. A new deferred\npayment agreement need not be offered to a customer who is in default on an\nexisting deferred payment agreement; provided, however, that such a customer\nmay have his or her existing payment agreement renegotiated once within a\n24-month period if he or she demonstrates that his or her financial\ncircumstances have changed significantly because of conditions beyond his or\nher control. (b) A deferred payment\nagreement: (1)\nshall obligate the customer to\nmake timely payments of current charges for basic local exchange service\ntogether with payment of the amount deferred during the pendency of the\nagreement; (2)\nshall be for total\namounts up to $150 but may be greater amounts if agreed to by the telephone\ncorporation or directed by the commission or its authorized designee; (3)\nshall be for a time period of no less\nthan five months unless otherwise agreed to by the customer; and\n(4)\nmay require the customer to make a down\npayment which shall not exceed the lesser of one fifth of the amount deferred\nor three months of the customer's average billing for basic local exchange\nservice plus the difference, if any, between the total amount of arrears and\nthe amount being deferred. (c) Telephone corporations and customers\nshould observe the following practices in developing the terms of deferred\npayment agreements: payment of amounts deferred may be made on a weekly, monthly or longer basis, at the convenience of the parties to the agreement. Telephone corporations must voluntarily offer plans with down payments of\nlesser amounts than allowed by subdivision (b) of this section when a customer\ncannot reasonably make a down payment equal to the amount allowed by\nsubdivision (b). Eligible customers may voluntarily waive their right to make a\ndown payment of not more than the amount allowed by subdivision (b) of this\nsection, but telephone corporations cannot require or otherwise solicit\ncustomers to make such waiver. Amendments of payment agreements should, to the\nextent reasonable and practical, reflect the changed circumstances of the\ncustomer. (d) If the telephone\ncorporation believes that a deferred payment agreement should not be offered\nbecause a customer has the resources to pay his or her bill, it shall notify\nthe customer and the commission or its designee in writing of the reasons for\nits belief. The commission or its designee shall, in accordance with the\ncomplaint procedures set forth in section\n609.16\nof this Part, forthwith\nmake a determination whether the customer has the resources to pay his or her\nbill. A telephone corporation shall stay any suspension or termination\nactivity, and restore or provide service pending the decision on the telephone\ncorporation's complaint by the commission or its authorized designee.
