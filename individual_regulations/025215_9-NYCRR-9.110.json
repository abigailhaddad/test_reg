Tit. 9 § 9.110 - Executive Order No. 110: Directing State Agencies, Authorities, and Entities to Prioritize the Allocation of Certain Discretionary Funds toThose Localities That Promote the Construction of Housing\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the cost of housing in New York State is among the\nmost expensive in the nation. The cost to purchase a home or to rent a home is\ncaused, in part, by onerous local government policies that unduly inhibit\nhousing development generally or prohibit the approval of certain housing\nproposals and thereby increase development costs and restrict the housing\nsupply; WHEREAS, local policies, practices, and decisions that\nimpede housing development, particularly the production of multifamily units, hamper employment growth; increase the cost of living; contribute to sprawl; worsen traffic problems and commuting times; and constrain housing choice for\nlow-income households and households of color who disproportionately rely on\nmultifamily housing to provide them with housing opportunities that they can\nafford; thus, such policies, practices, and decisions lead to unintended\nconsequences to public health, safety, and general community welfare; WHEREAS, the State lacks critical information regarding\nlocal planning, land use, and zoning practices, as well as regarding housing\nproduction, all of which is necessary for the State to assist localities in\nhousing development and to identify and redress impediments to housing growth\nthroughout New York; WHEREAS, the State has discretion regarding the\nprioritization of certain funds awarded by the State on a competitive basis to\napplicants that may include municipal governmental entities; WHEREAS, the State has the authority to prioritize the\naward of some discretionary funds to help further critical state\ninterests; WHEREAS, it is a matter of State concern and the policy of\nthe State that localities and the municipal entities they support or control\nmust begin to take steps to address overly restrictive local housing policies, practices, and decisions to best ensure and maintain public health, safety, and\ngeneral community welfare, and to encourage and support the production of\nhousing across New York, especially multifamily, affordable, and supportive\nhousing developments; NOW, THEREFORE, I, KATHY HOCHUL, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution of the\n\nState of New York, do hereby order, effective until such time as I may declare, as follows: Definitions: a. \"Affected State Entities\" means (i) all agencies, offices, and departments over\nwhich the Governor has executive authority, and (ii) all public benefit\ncorporations, public authorities, boards, and commissions, for which the\n\nGovernor appoints the Chair, the Chief Executive, or the majority of Board\n\nMembers, except for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, any\ninterstate or international authorities as defined in section\ntwo\nof the\npublic authorities law, and any local authorities as defined in section\ntwo\nof the\npublic authorities law. b. \"Locality\" shall refer to all cities, towns, or villages that regulate\nplanning, land use, zoning, and/or local and regional growth and development\npursuant to the general city law, the town law, the village law, the municipal\nhome rule law, or other state law, as applicable\nc.

The Division shall have the\ndiscretion to establish multiple tiers of Pro-Housing Community Program\n\nCertifications to distinguish between Localities based upon which or how many\nof the criteria that the Division establishes that the Localities meet. In\naddition, the following terms shall also apply: i. \"Certified Locality\" shall refer to a\nlocality that has received a Pro-Housing Community Program Certification from\nthe Division; and\nii. 'Non-Certified Locality' shall refer to a locality that has not received a\n\nPro-Housing Community Program Certification from the\n\nDivision. 2. An Affected\n\nState Entity that administers any Pro-Housing Community Program shall give\npriority among the Locality applications for such funds to those Locality\napplications made by Certified Localities, and shall further prioritize among\n\nCertified Localities based upon the tier of Pro-Housing Community Program\n\nCertification each Certified Locality has received from the Division. Provided, however, that applications made by Non-Certified Localities will not be\ndeprioritized relative to applications from Certified Localities if the\napplication from the Non-Certified Localities is expressly for the purpose of\nfunding housing development, including mixed-use developments that contain\nhousing components, or would fund non-housing investments necessary for and\nmade in relation to a particular housing development. Provided further that\nthis paragraph shall only apply if the Division has begun issuing Pro-Housing\n\nCommunity Program Certifications at the time an Affected State Entity is\nconsidering applications for a Pro-Housing Community Program. 3.
