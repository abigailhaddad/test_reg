  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 230.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the\npurposes of this Part, the general definitions of Part 200 apply. (b) The following definitions shall also\napply to this Part: (1)\n'Annual throughput'. The amount of gasoline transferred into or dispensed from a gasoline dispensing\nsite during any 12 consecutive months. (2)\n'CARB'. California Air Resources Board as\ndefined in California's Health and Safety Code, section 39003 (1975) (see Table\n1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). (3)\n'Dual-point vapor recovery system'. A\ngasoline storage tank equipped with an entry port for gasoline and a separate\nexit port for vapor collection. (4)\n'Gasoline'. A petroleum distillate or petroleum distillate/alcohol blend having\na Reid vapor pressure of 27.6 kilopascals or greater, which is used as a fuel\nfor internal combustion engines. (5)\n'Gasoline dispensing site'. A site where\ngasoline is dispensed into motor vehicle fuel tanks or into portable containers\nfrom a stationary gasoline storage tank larger than 250 gallons. (6)\n'Gasoline storage tank'. A stationary\nstorage tank larger than 250 gallons located at a gasoline dispensing site\nwhich is used to store gasoline. (7)\n'Gasoline transport vehicle'. A tank\ntruck, trailer or railroad tank car, with a capacity of 300 gallons or more, used to transport gasoline. (8)\n'Gauge well'. An opening in the top of a gasoline storage tank used to measure\nthe amount of product in the tank. (9)\n'Reconstructed'. Any physical change to a\ngasoline storage tank where the fixed capital cost of the new components\nexceeds 50 percent of the fixed capital cost that would be required to\nconstruct a comparable new source. (10)\n'Stage I vapor recovery system'. A\nsystem that forces gasoline vapors from a gasoline storage tank into a\nvapor-tight gasoline transport vehicle through direct displacement of the\ngasoline being transferred. (11)\n'Stage II vapor recovery system'. A system that captures gasoline vapors\ndisplaced or withdrawn from a vehicle fuel tank during refueling and returns\nthe vapors back to the gasoline storage tank. (12)\n'Submerged filling'. The use of a fill\npipe or drop tube intended to minimize splashing of gasoline when loading a\ngasoline storage tank. (13)\n'Vapor-tight'. A condition that precludes vapor loss. Compliance with\nvapor-tight requirements can be determined by checking to ensure that the\nconcentration at a potential leak source is less than 100 percent of the lower\nexplosive limit (LEL) when measured with a combustible gas detector, calibrated\nwith propane, at a distance of 1 inch from the source. (14)\n'Vehicle dismantling facility'. A\nfacility that decommissions, dismantles and recycles end of life\nvehicles. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
