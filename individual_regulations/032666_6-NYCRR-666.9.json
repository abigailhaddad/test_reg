  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 666.9 - Variances from the regulations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No\nvariance may authorize any development or improvement prohibited by the act. The department, upon receipt of a written request made in conjunction with a\npermit application pursuant to this Part, may vary or modify any provision of\nthis Part relating to allowable land uses or development so long as it is the\nminimum variance necessary and only if: (1)\nin the case of a request for a use variance, the provision(s) to be varied or\nmodified would cause an unnecessary hardship for the applicant. In order to\nprove such unnecessary hardship the applicant must demonstrate that: (i) the provision(s) to be varied or modified\ndeprive the applicant of all economic use or benefit from the property in\nquestion, which deprivation must be established by competent financial\nevidence; (ii)\nthe alleged hardship\nrelating to the property in question is unique, and does not apply to a\nsubstantial portion of the river corridor; (iii)\nthe requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the river corridor; and\n(iv)\nthe alleged hardship has not been\nself-created; and\n(2)\nin\nthe case of a request for an area variance, the area or dimensional\nprovision(s) to be varied or modified would cause practical difficulty for the\napplicant. In making its determination, the department will consider the\nbenefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as weighed against the\nadverse impacts upon river resources. The department will also consider: (i) whether and to what extent a change will\nbe produced in the character of the river corridor or a detriment to nearby\nproperties will be created by the granting of the area variance; (ii)\nwhether the benefit sought by the\napplicant can be achieved by some method, feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than an area variance; (iii)\nwhether the requested area variance is substantial; (iv)\nwhether the proposed variance will have\nan adverse effect or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the\nriver corridor; and\n(v) whether the\nalleged practical difficulty was self-created, which consideration will be\nrelevant to the decision of the department, but will not necessarily preclude\nthe granting of the area variance. In addition to addressing the foregoing considerations, an applicant for an area variance has the option of seeking to prove, by\ncompetent financial evidence, that the strict application of the subject\nprovision(s) of this Part will result in significant economic injury. Such\nevidence will be limited to the effect of such provision(s) upon the value of\nthe property in question; whether the value would be enhanced were a variance\ngranted will not be relevant. If the applicant demonstrates significant\neconomic injury, the burden is on the department to establish that the strict\napplication of the subject provision(s) is reasonably related to the purpose\nand policy of the act and this Part. (3)\nin the case of applicants which are State\nagencies or municipal corporations, the granting of a variance must be equally\nas environmentally protective of the river values identified in section\n666.2\n(e) of this\n\nPart as compliance with the provision(s) to be varied and must fulfill a public\nhealth, safety or welfare function. (b) A written request for a variance will\ncontain each of the following: (1)\na\ndescription of the variance requested; (2)\na listing of each standard to be\nvaried; (3)\na statement of the\nminimum relief necessary from each standard to be varied; (4)\na map of the area showing the location of\nthe requested variance, proposed mitigation, property boundaries, and adjacent\nowners of record, if deemed necessary by the department; (5)\nin the case of a request for a use\nvariance, the applicant may be required to provide financial evidence which may\ninclude the following: (i) the rate of return\non the property both with and without the requested variance; (ii)\nthe owner's investment in the property, including purchase price, taxes, expenses, carrying costs, and cost of\nimprovements; and\n(iii)\nincome, if\nany, produced by the property; (6)\na discussion of alternative site\npossibilities outside the river area; and\n(7)\na discussion of proposals for\nenvironmental impact reduction and/or mitigation. Such proposed mitigation must\ncomply with the following: (i) the mitigation\nmust occur on or in the immediate vicinity of the site of the proposed variance\nif possible; (ii)\nthe location of\nthe proposed mitigation must be subject to regulation under the act and this\n\nPart upon completion; and\n(iii)\nthe\nmitigation must provide substantially the same or more benefits than will be\nlost through the proposed activity. (c) Any mitigation required in connection\nwith the grant of a variance will be included as a permit condition and must be\ncompleted if other work is commenced. (d) Any land use or development which, but\nfor this subdivision, would require a variance due to noncompliance with one or\nmore specific standards or criteria in this Part, may be permitted by the\ndepartment without such variance if: (1)\nthe\ndepartment determines that the project, if approved, will not adversely impact\nany affected river resource; and\n(2)\nthe project satisfies all other\napplicable standards and criteria, including the standards for permit issuance\nset forth in section\n666.8\nof this Part. For the purposes of this subdivision, a determination of\ncomplete application pursuant to Part 621 of this Title shall not preclude the\ndepartment from requiring an applicant to submit additional information in the\nevent that one or more potential significant adverse impacts are identified and\na variance is necessary for the project to proceed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n666.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
