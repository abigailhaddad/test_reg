(3)\n\nCertain\ninformation concerning the property is necessary in order to perform an\nappraisal but such information cannot be obtained. (4)\n\nThe sample parcel is determined to be\npart of a single economic entity for valuation purposes which would be\nappraised in the manner provided in subdivision (b) of this section if not for\nthe fact that the economic entity also includes wholly exempt property, the\nassessed value of which comprises more than 50 percent of the total assessed\nvalue of the economic entity. (5)\n\nThe sample parcel is owned by a person who is: (i) the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Comptroller, Attorney General, or a member of the Legislature of the State of\n\nNew York; (ii)\na member of the\n\nState Board of Real Property Tax Services; (iii)\nan employee of ORPTS; (iv)\nthe chief executive officer or a member\nof the governing body of a county, city, town or village; (v) a county director of real property tax\nservices; or\n(vi)\nan\nassessor.
