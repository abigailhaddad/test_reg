  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 500.5 - Penalties\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Monetary\npenalties. OFPC may assess monetary penalties of up to $500 per calendar\nday commencing on the first day following the abatement date specified in an\norder, and continuing until the violation has been abated. Abatement of\nviolations shall be verified by OFPC. Calculation of monetary penalties shall\nbe governed by the following standards which will be used to determine the\ngravity of the violation: (1)\n\nFire\nprobability and loss severity. (i) Fire\nprobability is OFPC's assessment of the likelihood that a fire will occur. At a\nminimum, the following factors shall be considered: contents, processes, arrangement of contents, occupancies, operations conducted in the area, construction class and hours of operation. Based upon these factors, OFPC will\nassign one of the following fire probability values from the table appearing in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision: (a) Likely\nto occur immediately or within a short period of time (fire probability\nA). (b) Probably will occur in time\n(fire probability B). (c) Possible\nto occur in time (fire probability C). (d) Unlikely to occur (fire probability\nD). (ii)\n\nLoss severity is\nOFPC's assessment of the expected loss should a fire occur. At a minimum, the\nfollowing factors shall be considered: contents, processes, occupancies, construction, installed fire protection features and impact of the deficiency\nduring a fire. Based upon these factors, OFPC will assign one of the following\nloss severity values from the table appearing in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision: (a) Loss of life, major monetary\nloss (>$5,000,000) (loss severity 1). (b) Permanent disability, possible death, severe monetary loss ($1,000,000 - $5,000,000) (loss severity 2). (c) Possible injury, moderate monetary loss\n($100,000 - $999,999) (loss severity 3). (d) Injury unlikely, slight monetary loss\n(<$100,000) (loss severity 4). (2)\nA determination of the fire safety\ndeficiency code (FSD) will be made from the table below based on the fire\nprobability value and the loss severity value. LOSS SEVERITY\nFIRE\nPROBABILITY\nA\nB\nC\nD\n1\nI\nI\nII\nIII\n2\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\n3\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\n4\nIII\nIV\nV\nV\n(3)\n\nFine amounts and abatement periods. Once the FSD codes for each violation are\ndetermined, a hazard class, predetermined daily fines and maximum abatement\nperiod shall be established according to the following table: FSD Code\n\nViolation\n\nClass\n\nDefinition\n\nDaily Fine\n\nMaximum Abatement\n\nPeriod\nI\nSevere\nA severe violation that would result in high loss\nof life or catastrophic loss of the facility or contents\n$500\n1 day\nII\nSerious\nA serious violation that has a high probability of\nloss of life or major impact on the facility or contents\n$400\n3 days\nIII\nSignificant\nA violation that may constitute a significant risk\nto life or property\n$200\n7 days\nIV\nModerate\nA violation that may contribute to minor property\ndamage or slight risk to people\n$100\n15 days\nV\nMinimal\nA violation that has little impact on property or\npeople\n$50\n30 days\n(4)\n\nFines will be paid within 30 days of assessment. (5)\n\nThe State Fire Administrator shall have\nthe discretion to compromise or settle fines where there is written\ndemonstration that the public interest in fire safety would so warrant. (i) No compromise or settlement shall occur\nwhile the violation for which the fine was imposed continues unabated. A\ncollege of university may request a compromise no later than 60 days after\nOFPC's verification of violation abatement. (ii)\n\nAny compromise monies granted by the\n\nState Fire Administrator shall be used by the college or university to increase\nor improve fire and life safety activities or equipment on the\ncampus. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n500.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
