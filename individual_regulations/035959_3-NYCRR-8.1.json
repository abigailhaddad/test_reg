  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 8.1 - Explanation; authority\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe stated purpose of chapter 204 of the Laws of 1997, as\namended by chapter 526 of the Laws of 1998, is to encourage the establishment\nof bank branches in specially designated geographic locations, known as\n\"banking development districts,\" where there is a demonstrated need for banking\nservices. The establishment of a new branch by a bank, trust company, national\nbank, or, on and after January 1, 1999, by a savings bank, savings and loan\nassociation, Federal savings and loan association or Federal savings bank\nwithin such a banking development district should enhance access by consumers\nto banking services and promote local economic development. Underserved\nconsumers may reside in urban or rural areas which may have different income\nlevels, demographic characteristics and population densities. Regardless of an\narea's characteristics, it is anticipated that greater access to banking\nservices will encourage the area's residents, who may have no banking\nrelationships, to become part of the financial mainstream. It is further\nanticipated that the establishment of a bank branch will provide a foundation\nto stimulate the local economy by enhancing access to capital for local\nbusinesses. This will promote long-term economic development, foster job\ncreation, and promote community stabilization and revitalization. As provided\nin section\n96-d\n(5)\nof the Banking Law, savings banks and\nsavings and loan associations authorized to participate hereunder, are further\nauthorized to furnish security for any such deposits as they may receive under\nthe banking developments district programs in the manner and to the extent\nauthorized in the case of commercial banks and trust companies under such\nprogram. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n8.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
