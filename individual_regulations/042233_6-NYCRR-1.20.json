  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 1.20 - Deer management permits-application and issuance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Purpose. This section contains the application and issuance\nprocedures for deer management permits. A deer management permit (DMP) is a\nspecial permit issued to an individual or group of individuals allowing the\nholder to take a deer in a specified wildlife management unit (WMU) in addition\nto any deer an individual may otherwise legally take. WMUs are defined in\nsection\n4.1\nof this Title. (b) Application\nprocess. (1)\n\nGenerally. Application\nmay be made at all license issuing agents, by telephone, by internet or by\nmail. Forms may be obtained from hunting license issuing agents, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation offices, the department's website and by mail from\nthe department. Each application must include the choice of the WMU or WMUs for\nwhich a permit(s) is desired. (2)\n\nInitial application period. The deadline for the initial application period is\n\nOctober 1st. In order to receive consideration, applications for the initial\napplication period made by phone, internet or at license issuing agents shall\nbe submitted on or before October 1st for that license year. Applications\nsubmitted by mail shall be postmarked on or before October 1st for that license\nyear. (3)\n\nMail applications. Each\ngroup member must sign and date the application, to the effect that he/she has\nread and understands the certification on the application and the rules and\nregulations contained in the official information sheet and that all\ninformation furnished by him/her is true and correct. (4)\n\nApplication fees. All applications must\ninclude the fee required in accordance with section\n11-0913\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law. This fee will be waived for holders of junior archery, junior\nhunting, and lifetime sportsman (if bought prior to October 1, 2009) license\ntypes. Monies received in excess of the application fee will not be\nrefunded. (c) Application categories and selection order will be as follows: (1)\n\nAn applicant with three or more\npreference points may be issued his/her first choice DMP during the initial\napplication period. (2)\n\nLandowner/disabled veteran applications. Approximately 50 percent of the DMP\nissuance target for each WMU shall first be available to persons or spouses of\npersons owning 50 acres or more in one or more parcels, which share a common\nboundary, in the same WMU, or to disabled veterans having 40 percent or greater\nservice-related disability. (i) Proof of\nlandownership. The group member who is the owner or spouse of the owner of the\n50 acres or more of land shall provide proof of land ownership, the WMU where\nthe land is located and the tax map identification number for the property as\nrecorded in the county clerk's office. When a parcel of land is jointly owned, only one of the co-owners may apply for landowner preference as the landowning\nmember. When land is owned by a corporation, only one person designated by the\ncorporation shall apply for landowner preference, and this person shall obtain\nan original letter or a certified copy of a resolution adopted by the governing\nbody of the corporation designating him/her by name as the one authorized to\napply. The applicant shall present this letter as the time of application. Where lands are being purchased under an executory contract of sale, such\ntransactions shall be duly recorded in the office of the county clerk in the\ncounty in which the lands are situated. Failure to comply with any of these\nrequirements shall be cause for denial of the application for landowner\npreference. An application which is submitted without valid proof of\nlandownership, but is otherwise correct, may be processed as a nonlandowner\napplication. (ii)\n\nProof of disabled\nveteran status. The group member who is a veteran with 40 percent or greater\nservice-related disability shall provide proof of disability, in the form of a\nletter from the U.S. Veterans Administration, the N.Y.S. Division of Veterans\n\nAffairs, or a branch of the U.S. Military dated during the calendar year of\napplication, on letterhead with an original signature, certifying the\ndisability. Failure to comply with any of these requirements shall be cause for\ndenial of the application for disabled veteran preference. An application which\nis submitted without valid proof of disablement, but is otherwise correct, may\nbe processed as a regular application. (3)\n\nResident applications. Permits remaining\nafter landowner/disabled veteran permits have been issued shall next be\navailable to applications containing at least one New York State\nresident. (4)\n\nNonresident\napplications. Any permits remaining after all resident applications have been\nprocessed shall then be available to applications with no New York State\nresidents. (5)\n\nNonselectee\npreference certificate credits. Within applicant categories preference will be\ngiven to applications containing nonselection credits from previous year(s). Preference will be administered, highest to lowest, with those with the\ngreatest number of nonselection credits being issued permits first. (6)\n\nSecond permits. In WMUs in which the\noptimal number of DMPs is not expected to be achieved through the issuance of\nfirst permits, additional permits may be available as second permits. Applications requesting second permits will be processed in accordance with the\ncategories, selection order, and preferences described in this\nsubdivision. (d) Application processing and DMP issuance. (1)\n\nIf a WMU over-subscription is expected, a\nrandom number, ranging from 0.0 to 1.0, shall be computer generated for each\napplicant. If this random number is less than or equal to the predetermined\nprobability for that applicant class, the permit will be issued. If the number\nis greater than the predetermined probability for that applicant class, the\npermit will not be issued. (2)\n\nIn\nthe event that any applicant is denied either a first or second permit during\nthe initial application period in a WMU in which the optimum number of permits\nwere not issued, permits may be issued to previously denied applicants in\naccordance with the categories, selection order, and preferences described in\nsubdivision (c) of this section. Such permits will be mailed to selected\napplicants. Permit issuance will continue until the optimal number of permits\nhave been issued or until all previously denied applicants have been issued\npermits, whichever comes first. For nonselectee preference purposes, these\npermits will be considered to have been issued during the initial application\nperiod. (e) Subsequent application period(s). In WMUs for which the number of applications received\nresults in the issuance of less than the optimal number of DMPs, the department\nmay reopen the application process at license issuing agents only and issue\nDMPs on a first-come, first-served basis until the optimal number of DMPs have\nbeen issued. In addition, \"Bonus DMPs,\" described in subdivision (k) of this\nsection, may be issued at the department's discretion. (f) Successful applicants. A validated DMP will be issued by the license issuing\nagent or mailed to the successful applicant or the group leader of successful\napplicants. (g) Unsuccessful first permit applicants. Nonselectee preference points will be issued by the\nlicense issuing agent or mailed to the unsuccessful applicant or the group\nleader of each group not receiving a first choice permit during the initial\napplication period. (h) Incomplete, incorrect, or illegible applications will not receive consideration\nand will be denied or returned to the applicant as incomplete. An applicant\nwhose application cannot be processed because it is incomplete, incorrect or\nillegible will forfeit any nonselected preference credits submitted. (i) Any person who makes a false statement in\nthe application for a DMP is in violation of the Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw, section 71-0921. A DMP obtained by fraud is void. A DMP is void if the\napplicant offered false statements or information in the application. Any\napplication received from a person or group who has failed to make payment for\npreviously issued permits will not receive consideration and will be denied or\nreturned to the applicant as incomplete. (j) A damaged or lost DMP carcass tag may be\nreplaced by any license issuing agent. (k) Bonus DMPs. In any WMU where the department determines that limited\naccess, hunter numbers or legal implements hinder the achievement of needed\nharvest, the department may issue bonus DMPs. The department will annually\ndetermine if these permits are valid for deer of either sex or antlerless deer\nonly. Either sex or antlerless only harvest restrictions will be stated on\napplication, and permittees must comply with any such harvest\nrestrictions\n(1)\n\nEligibility. Upon\nsuccessfully filling a DMP by killing an antlerless deer in any WMU where the\ndepartment has determined that bonus permits will be issued, a hunter may\nobtain a bonus DMP valid in the same WMU in which the antlerless deer was\ntaken. Bonus permits will be issued on a first-come first-served basis. The\ndepartment may limit the number of bonus permits issued to each hunter. Also\nthe department may terminate the issuance of bonus DMPS at any time. Persons\nwishing to obtain a bonus permit, after harvesting an antlerless deer, must\nmeet the following application requirements: (i) The department may require the head or\nwhole carcass of the antlerless deer and the report tag be taken to a deer\ncheck station/permit outlet. (ii)\nA\nsworn statement must be submitted stating the WMU in which the deer was\ntaken. (2)\n\nPermit\nissuance. The department or a designated agent will issue a bonus DMP to\nsuccessful applicants. No fee is required. (l) Sale of DMPs. No person shall buy, sell or offer to sell a\nDMP. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
