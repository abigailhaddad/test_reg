  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4300.26 - General management requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Programming. (1)\nA totalisator company shall develop and\nmaintain written procedure manuals that outline structured programming methods\nused by the programmers. The manuals must give the programmers sufficient\ninformation to understand the programming methodologies, base operating\nsystems, and maintenance procedures. (2)\n\nThe totalisator company shall develop and\nmaintain a written Systems Development Life Cycle (SDLC) that requires\nsign-offs at pertinent checkpoints. The SDLC must address the following or the\nequivalent as acceptable to the commission: (i) a procedure for accepting written\nrequests for systems design or major program changes from users and a method\nfor handling and recording these requests; (ii)\nthe feasibility study stage; (iii)\nthe general systems design\nstage; (iv)\ndetailed systems\nspecification; (v) program\ntesting; (vi)\nsystem\ntesting; (vii)\nconversion; and\n(viii)\nsystems acceptance by\nthe totalisator company. (3)\nA totalisator company must develop and\nfollow procedures to manage all program changes without regard to the\ncomplexity of the modification. The procedures must at a minimum: (i) establish controls to prevent\nunauthorized and potentially inaccurate program changes from being incorporated\ninto the production environment; (ii)\nregulate both scheduled and emergency\nchanges to ensure the integrity of the computer system; (iii)\npermit revisions of computer programs\nonly after receiving a written or electronic request from a user, submitted on\na sequentially numbered change request form, which is maintained; (iv)\nrequire program changes to be developed, tested, and compiled only in a test environment that is not connected to an\non-line totalisator network; (v) require all program changes to be thoroughly tested, reviewed and approved by a\ntotalisator company supervisor before being placed into operation; and\n(vi)\nmaintain a written or\nelectronic log to be made available to the commission upon request when\nprogrammers have physical access to the totalisator room or electronic access\nto the operation environment. (4)\n\nBefore a totalisator company may place a\nmajor programming revision into production or transfer any data affected by the\nrevision from the test environment to the production environment, the\ntotalisator company must follow the procedures for changes to totalisator\nsoftware found in section\n4300.25\n(d) of this\n\nPart. (b) Totalisator\noperations. A totalisator company shall maintain a written operations manual\nfor each totalisator system. The manual must clarify the authority, duties, responsibilities, and lines of communication for totalisator operators and\nnetwork managers. The manual must contain sufficient detail to ensure\ntotalisator personnel understand their job duties. The operations manual must\ninclude complete documentation for operation of the totalisator system and its\nsoftware, including at a minimum: (1)\nthe\nduties described in section\n4300.27\nof this Part (relating to\npersonnel requirements); (2)\nclearly defined restrictions for totalisator room access; (3)\ngeneral block diagrams of program options\n(menu tree) available to totalisator operators; (4)\na glossary of terms used in reports, including formulas for calculating the displayed results; (5)\nthe relationship, if any, between\ninformation contained in reports; (6)\nstart-up and shutdown\nprocedures; (7)\ngeneral operating\nprocedures; (8)\nrestart and\nrecovery procedures; and\n(9)\nemergency procedures, including a list of individuals to notify if a system\nrequires an emergency revision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4300.26\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
