The following rules and regulations, enacted in accordance with the provisions of chapter 45 of the Consolidated Laws (Public Health Law), as finally amended by chapter 879 of the Laws of 1953 and numbered article 11 thereof, shall apply to all existing wells and such wells as may be developed in the future on the properties of the Spring Valley Water Works and Supply Company near Suffern and in Viola in the town of Ramapo and in Piermont in the town of Orangetown, Rockland County, New York, such wells being a source of public water supply of said corporation.

(2)\n\nThe term wells means the wells now used as sources of this public water supply or any wells developed in the future as additional sources of this public water supply, which are located on land now owned by the corporation near Suffern and in Viola in the town of Ramapo and in Piermont in the town of Orangetown, Rockland County, New York. (3)\n\nThe term linear distance of a structure or object from a well is the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the well. (c) Human excreta. (1)\n\nNo human excreta shall be buried in the soil at a distance of less than 500 feet from any well. (2)\n\nNo privy or receptacle of any kind for the storage or deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of any well. (3)\n\nEvery privy or receptacle for the storage or deposit of human excreta, located between the prescribed 100 feet and 200 feet from any well, shall be arranged so that all excreta will be received in a suitable watertight receptacle or removable container, which shall be emptied when filled within six inches of the top and the contents disposed of so that no nuisance will be created. (4)\n\nWhenever, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, excremental matter from any aforesaid privy, receptacle, trench or place of disposal may be washed through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any well, the said privy, receptacle, trench or place of disposal shall be removed, after due notice to the owner thereof, to such places as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health. (d) Sewage. (1)\n\nNo sewage shall be discharged nor deposited on or beneath the surface of the ground within 200 feet of any well except into watertight receptacles, the contents of which shall be removed before overflowing in such a manner as to prevent the pollution of the ground about the receptacle, or into suitable watertight iron pipes with tight leaded joints connected to a sewage disposal system, a permit for which has been granted by the State Commissioner of Health. It is provided, however, that no such watertight iron pipe shall be located within 50 feet of any well. (2)\n\nNo bath water, sink or laundry wastes shall be discharged or deposited on or beneath the surface of the ground within 200 feet of any well. (e) Flooding. Any person who, by reason of alteration in surface grading or by development of property upstream, permits a change in surface drainage resulting either in an increased rate or concentration of discharge of surface water onto the lands on which the wells are located or adjacent property or any person who permits the undue obstruction of any drainage outlet downstream from the said well property and causes flooding of the said property shall be deemed in violation of these rules. (f) Wastes, refuse and garbage. No garbage, refuse, putrescible matter, decayed fruits or vegetables, dead animal or other material that pollutes water shall be deposited on or beneath the surface of the ground within 200 feet of any well nor in such a manner that it can be washed by rain, melting snow or otherwise through the ground into the wells.

No stable for cattle or horses, barnyard, hogyard, pigpen, poultry house or yard, hitching place or standing place for horses or other animals shall be located within 200 feet of any well. (h) Manure. No manure or manure pile shall be maintained or allowed to remain within 200 feet of any well. (i) Trespassing. No trespassing shall be allowed upon the property of the Spring Valley Water Works and Supply Company upon which the wells of the public water supply of said corporation are located and no person or persons shall enter in or upon such property except such person or persons as may be charged with the maintenance of the supply in the official performance of their duties or such other persons as may be authorized to enter said property by the Spring Valley Water Works and Supply Company. (j) Camps. No camp, tent, building or other structure for occupancy by transients or for the housing of laborers engaged in construction work or for any use, except as a private camp or dwelling maintained by a person for his own personal use or for the use of his family and friends, shall be located, placed or maintained within a distance of 200 feet of any well. (k) Cemeteries. No interment of a human body shall be made within a distance of 500 feet of any well. (l) Inspections.

The aforesaid corporation shall report to the State Commissioner of Health in writing annually, on the first day of January, the results of the regular inspections which have been made, the number of violations found, the number of notices served and the general surroundings of the wells at the time of the last inspection. (m) Increase in linear distance. Any linear or limiting distance contained in these subdivisions may be increased where in the opinion of the duly designated enforcement representatives of the State Department of Health such increase is necessary for the protection of the wells against contamination or pollution. (n) Penalty. In accordance with section 1103 of chapter 45 of the Consolidated Laws (Public Health Law), as amended by chapter 879 of the Laws of 1953, the penalty for each and every violation of or noncompliance with any of these rules and regulations which relate to a permanent source or act of contamination is hereby fixed at $100.
