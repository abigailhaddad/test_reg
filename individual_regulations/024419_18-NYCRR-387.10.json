Tit. 18 § 387.10 - Income standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Households which contain an elderly or\ndisabled member as defined in section\n387.1\nof this Part, are required\nto meet only the net income eligibility standards for the food stamp program as\nset forth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. Households which do not contain\nan elderly or disabled member must meet both the net income eligibility\nstandards and the gross income eligibility standards for the food stamp\nprogram. However, households which are categorically eligible for food stamps, as provided in section\n387.14\n(a)(4)\nof\nthis Part, do not have to meet the net income eligibility standards or the\ngross income eligibility for the food stamp program. (1)\n\nThe gross income eligibility standard for\nthe food stamp program shall be 130 percent of the Federal income poverty level\nfor the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. (2)\n\nThe net income eligibility standard for\nthe food stamp program shall be the Federal income poverty level for the 48\ncontiguous states and the District of Columbia. (3)\n\nThe net and gross income eligibility\nstandards, as described above, are revised each October 1st by the United\n\nStates Department of Agriculture as defined by the Food Stamp Act of 1977, as\namended, to reflect the annual adjustment to the Federal income poverty\nguidelines for the contiguous 48 states, the District of Columbia, Alaska, and\n\nHawaii. (Food Stamp Act of 1977, Compilation of Food Stamp Act of 1977 and\nother selected Federal nutrition statutes prepared by the Committee on\n\nAgriculture, U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC, 1984, pages 11-22.) The monthly net and gross eligibility\nstandards will be prescribed in general notices published in the Federal\n\nRegister. (b) In\ncalculating a household's income for the purpose of determining eligibility for\nfood stamps, income shall mean all income, earned and unearned, from whatever\nsource, except for items specifically excluded in this subdivision. (1)\n\nEarned income shall include: (i) all wages and salaries of an\nemployee; (ii)\nthe gross income\nfrom a self-employment enterprise, including the total gain from the sale of\nany capital goods or equipment related to the business, excluding the costs of\ndoing business as described in this Part. Ownership of rental property shall be\nconsidered a self-employment enterprise; however, income derived from the\nrental property shall be considered earned income only if a member of the\nhousehold is actively engaged in the management of the property at least an\naverage of 20 hours a week. Payments from a roomer or boarder shall also be\nconsidered self-employment income; (iii)\ntraining allowances from vocational and\nrehabilitative programs recognized by Federal, State or local governments, to\nthe extent they are not a reimbursement; (iv)\npayments under Volunteers in Service to\n\nAmerica (VISTA) are considered earned income and subject to the earned income\ndeduction. However, such calculation must exclude payments made to those\nhouseholds which are specified in section\n387.11\nof this Part; and\n(v) earnings to individuals who are\nparticipating in on-the-job training programs under section 204(5), title II, of the Job Training Partnership Act. This provision does not apply to earnings\nreceived by household members under 19 years of age who are under the parental\ncontrol of another adult household member, regardless of school attendance\nand/or enrollment as set forth in section\n387.11\n(j) of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nEarned income\ndoes not include: (i) income excluded by\nsection\n387.11\nof this Part; or\n(ii)\nany portion of income earned under a\nwork supplementation or support program that is attributable to public\nassistance. (3)\n\nUnearned\nincome shall include, but not be limited to: (i) assistance payments from Federal or\nfederally aided public assistance programs, such as Supplemental Security\n\nIncome (SSI), Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC), or other\nassistance programs based on need except as provided for in this Part. Also\nincluded are payments made pursuant to the Home Relief (HR) program. Assistance\npayments derived from programs which require, as a condition of eligibility, the actual performance of work without compensation other than the assistance\npayments, will be considered unearned income; (ii)\nannuities, pensions, retirement, veterans' or disability benefits, workers' or unemployment compensation, old-age, survivor's or social security benefits, strike benefits, foster care\npayments for children or adults, adoption subsidies, and gross income minus the\ncost of doing business derived from rental property in which a household member\nis not actively engaged in the management of the property for at least 20 hours\na week; (iii)\nsupport or alimony\npayments made directly to the household from nonhousehold members; (iv)\nscholarships, educational grants, fellowships, deferred payment loans for education, veterans' educational\nbenefits less allowable exclusions which are used for or made available by the\neducational institution for certain expenses as specified in section\n387.11\nof this Part; (v) payments from government-sponsored\nprograms unless otherwise excluded; (vi)\ndividends, interest, royalties, and all\nother direct money payments from any source which can be construed to be a gain\nor benefit; and\n(vii)\nmonies which\nare withdrawn or dividends which are or could be received by a household from\ntrust funds considered to be excludable resources as specified in section\n387.9\nof this Part. Such trust\nwithdrawals shall be considered income in the month received, unless otherwise\nexempt under the provisions of this section. Dividends which the household has\nthe option of either receiving as income or reinvesting in the trust are to be\nconsidered as income in the month they become available to the household unless\notherwise exempt under the provisions of this Part. (4)\n\nThe earned and unearned income of an\nindividual disqualified for an intentional program violation or for failing to\ncomply with a food stamp work registration requirement or a food stamp work\nrequirement as provided in section\n385.3\nof this Title, must be\ncounted in its entirety as available to the remaining household members. The\nincome of individuals excluded for failing to apply for or provide a social\nsecurity number or for being an ineligible alien will continue to be counted as\nincome less a pro rata share for the excluded individual. The procedures for\ncalculating this pro rata share are set forth in section\n387.16\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (5)\n\nIf the benefits of a\nhousehold are reduced under a Federal, State or local law relating to a\nmeans-tested public assistance program for the failure of a member of the\nhousehold to perform an action required under the law or program, the household\nmay not receive an increased food stamp allotment as a result of a decrease in\nthe income of the household for the duration of the reduction to the extent\nthat the decrease is the result of the reduction. (6)\n\nUnless otherwise exempt, for households\ncontaining an alien sponsored after February 1, 1983 for whom a sponsor signed\nan affidavit of support or a similar statement as a condition of the alien's\nentry into the United States as a lawful permanent resident, portions of the\ngross income and the resources of a sponsor and the sponsor's spouse shall be\ndeemed unearned income and resources of a sponsored alien for three years\nfollowing the alien's admission for permanent residence to the United States. Money paid to the alien by the sponsor or sponsor's spouse would not be\nconsidered income to the alien unless the amount paid exceeds the amount deemed\navailable. The amount paid that exceeds the amount attributed would be\nconsidered income to the alien in addition to the amount attributed to the\nalien. Aliens exempt from the provisions of this paragraph are: (i) an alien participating in the food stamp\nprogram as a member of his or her sponsor's household; (ii)\naliens who are sponsored by an\norganization or group; (iii)\naliens\nwho were not required by the United States Department of Immigration to have a\nsponsor as a condition of the alien's entry or admission into the United States\nas a permanent resident under the Immigration and Nationality Act.
