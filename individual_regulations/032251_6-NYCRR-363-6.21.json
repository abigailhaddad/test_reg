  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.21 - Equivalent design standards and use of waste as construction and operational material\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An\napplicant may propose an equivalent design for any landfill component through\nthe submission of documentation substantiating the alternative component's\nability to perform in the same manner as the component specified in this Part. Equivalency determinations are not subject to the variance requirements of\nsection\n360.10\nof this Title. (b) When the equivalent design involves the\nsubstitution of waste for components of the facility's liner or final cover\nsystem, and where it can be demonstrated that these substitutions are below the\nuppermost barrier layer of the final cover and above the primary composite\nliner, equivalency determinations are not subject to the variance requirements\nof section\n360.10\nor beneficial use\nrequirements of section\n360.12\nof this Title. (1)\n\nEquivalent design applications for the\nuse of waste tire-derived aggregate in a leachate collection and removal system\nor gas venting layer must: (i) address\nprocedures for receipt of waste tires or waste tire-derived aggregate and\non-site processing or storage; (ii)\ntreat the waste tire-derived aggregate as conventional construction material\nand comply with the landfill's design and the applicable soil drainage layer\nprovisions of section\n363-6.10\nof this Part. This must\ninclude specifications for gradation analysis and permeability testing for both\nCQA and CQC; (iii)\nspecify that\nthe waste tires or waste tire-derived aggregate are free of soil, petroleum\nproducts or other contaminants; (iv)\nspecify that waste tires must be\nprocessed in a manner to keep exposed wires to no more than three\ninches; (v) specify that waste\ntires or waste tire-derived aggregate that were exposed to fire are not\nprocessed for use under this paragraph; (vi)\nspecify that the leachate collection and\nremoval system or gas venting layer must incorporate an appropriately specified\n12-inch layer of soil or stone between any geomembrane or GCL and a waste\ntire-derived aggregate layer; and\n(vii)\ndemonstrate that the final thickness of\nthe combined soil and waste tire-derived aggregate layers after compression\nwill be a minimum of 24 inches. (c) Use of waste as an alternative to\noperating cover. (1)\n\nThe department may\napprove the use of waste as an alternative operating cover (AOC) if the\nmaterial is capable of meeting the performance criteria for operating cover as\nspecified in section\n363-7.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart. Approval of the use of waste as an AOC is not subject to the variance\nrequirements of section\n360.10\nof this Title. (2)\n\nAll wastes intended to be used as AOC\nmust receive written department approval prior to their use. As a condition of\napproval, the department may require a sampling and analysis plan, including\nparameters to be tested, test methods, and frequency of testing to ensure\ncompliance with paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Unless otherwise approved by\nthe department, proposals to use AOC must meet the following requirements: (i) All proposals to use automobile shredder\nresidue as AOC must provide analytical data demonstrating that the automobile\nshredder residue does not contain total PCBs concentrations greater than 50\nparts per million. The data must include quarterly analysis for PCB\nconcentrations from each generator. (ii)\n\nAll proposals to use C&D debris as\nAOC must demonstrate that the concentration of sulfate does not exceed 0.5\npercent by weight. (d) Use of other non-waste materials as an\nalternative to operating cover. The department may approve the use of materials\nas AOC upon demonstration that the materials meet the requirements of section\n363-7.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart. Approval of the use of non-waste materials as an AOC is not subject to\nthe variance requirements of section\n360.10\nof this Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
