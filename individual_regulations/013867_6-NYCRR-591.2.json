(q) Pine\nbarrens project means a State project to acquire natural communities dominated\nby such biota as pitch pine, jack pine, and scrub oak which may be found\nassociated with a variety of natural resources, and which depend upon the\noccurrence of periodic fires for their perpetuation. (r) Primary public water supply aquifer means\na highly productive water-bearing formation identified by the department\nconsisting of unconsolidated (nonbedrock) geologic deposits, which: (1)\nreceives substantial recharge from the\noverlying land surface; and\n(2)\nis\npresently utilized as a major source of water for public water supply, including, but not limited to, the following aquifers: Endicott-Johnson City; Ramapo-Mahwah River Valleys; Irondogenesee-Buried Valley; Jamestown, Elmira-Horseheads-Big Flats; Cortland-Homer-Preble; Corning; Fishkill-Sprout\n\nCreek; Fulton; South Fallsburgh-Woodbourne; Schenectady; Cohocton River; Tonawanda Creek; Seneca River; Clifton Park-Halfmoon; Olean-Salamanca; Croton-on-Hudson; Owego-Waverly.
