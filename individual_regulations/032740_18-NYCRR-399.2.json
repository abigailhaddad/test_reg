(b) Unless\nspecifically granted written authorization to forego initial processing and to\nproceed directly on the alleged fraud/intentional program violation by either\nthe local social services official or his/her authorized representative or the\ndistrict attorney of the jurisdiction on the grounds that to do otherwise would\nprejudice the prosecution of the claim, local social services districts shall\ninitially proceed with the claim as an inadvertent household error prior to\neither referral to the district attorney or processing of the claim for an\nadministrative disqualification hearing. A local district's failure to\ndemonstrate compliance with the provisions of this subdivision shall be\ndeterminative only of the district's reimbursement and shall not affect the\ndepartment's determination at a hearing required by this Part or a court's\ndetermination in an instance in which a claim is referred by a local social\nservices district to the local district attorney for prosecution. Noncompliance\nwith the provisions of this section shall not affect the amount of allotment\nreduction authorized in section\n399.9\n(f) of this\n\nPart following a hearing decision that fraud/intentional program violation has\noccurred. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n399.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
