  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 45-2.4 - Load tests\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Test required. No passenger-carrying amusement device, which meets the criteria\nlisted below, shall be used or put into normal operation until it has withstood\na load test without failure in any material respect. Load tests will not be\nrequired for slides. Prototype load tests will not be accepted. (1)\n\nDevices having suspended passenger seats\nor spaces. (2)\n\nDevices normally\noperated at speeds or with movements creating severe centrifugal\nforces. (3)\n\nDevices so elevated\nthat structural failure is likely to cause passengers to be injured by\nfalling. (4)\n\nDevices as to which\nthe commissioner has ordered such a test upon finding it necessary to assure\nsafety. (b) Nature of\ntest. Each passenger seat or space shall be weighted with at least 150 pounds\ndead weight, except that in a device intended only for small children each seat\nor space shall be weighted with at least 75 pounds. While so loaded the device\nshall be operated at maximum normal speed as to test the full operation of all\ncontrol devices, speed-limiting devices, brakes and other equipment provided\nfor safety. (c) Evidence of test. Unless a load test is made in the presence of a representative of the\ncommissioner, the manager of the device shall cause to be filed with the\ncommissioner on a form provided by him a statement by either: (1)\nthe manufacturer of the device; (2)\nan insurance carrier lawfully doing\nbusiness in this State and carrying public liability insurance on the device; or\n(3)\na qualified licensed\nprofessional engineer showing whether the device withstood the test without\nfailure in any material respect and setting forth such other relevant\ninformation as the commissioner may require. Until such a statement is so filed\nit shall be presumed that the device has not withstood the test as\nrequired. (d) Effect of\ntest. If the device fails to withstand a load test it shall be deemed unsafe\nand shall not be used until and unless it has withstood a subsequent load test\nwithout failure in any material respect. If the device has withstood a load\ntest without failure in any material respect it shall be required to be so\ntested again only if rebuilt or modified or if there are reasonable grounds to\nbelieve that a further test is necessary to assure safety and the commissioner\norders such test to be made. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n45-2.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
