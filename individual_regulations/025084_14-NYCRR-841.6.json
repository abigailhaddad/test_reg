  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 841.6 - Medical assistance payments for inpatient substance use disorder withdrawal and stabilization services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The provisions of this section are\napplicable to programs certified as substance use disorder inpatient withdrawal\nand stabilization services pursuant to Part 816. (b) Rates of Payment. (1)\n\nRates will be calculated using a\ncost-based fee methodology inclusive of operating costs and capital\nreimbursement. There shall be no capital add-on to these fees, nor any separate\n\nMedicaid reimbursement for capital costs. (2)\n\nFees will be established using a\nregression model based on the relationship between normalized cost and program\ncapacity, recognizing both regional cost differentials and economies of scale. The calculated statewide fees based on program capacity, will then be adjusted\nusing regional cost factors (based on the county in which the facility is\nlocated). (3)\n\nFees will be deemed\nto be inclusive of all service delivery costs and will be considered payment in\nfull for fee-for-service Medicaid reimbursed services. (4)\n\nFee schedules used to determine rates\nwill be posted on the Office website. Fee schedules used to determine rates\ninclude: (i) Statewide OASAS Medically\n\nSupervised Inpatient Withdrawal (MSIW) fee chart based on bed size; and\n(ii)\n\nGeographic region and\nregional cost factor chart. (c) Bed size. (1)\n\nNew facilities: Bed size for new\nfacilities used for the fee calculation shall be based on 80% of the certified\ncapacity rounded to the nearest integer. After the first full year of\noperation, the fee calculation shall be revised based on 90% of certified\ncapacity rounded to the nearest integer. If the certified capacity changes for\nany MSIW program, including programs that have been in operation for less than\none year, the fee shall be revised based on 90% of the new certified capacity, effective on the date of the capacity change. (2)\n\nMinimum and maximum standards: Facilities\nwith fewer than six (6) beds shall use the six (6) bed fee. Facilities with an\nexcess of 120 beds (meaning \"bed size\" as calculated above) shall use the\n120-bed fee. (d) Appeals\nof medically supervised inpatient withdrawal fees. (1)\n\nFee adjustment for underutilization. MSIW\nproviders may request retroactive fee adjustments based on documented low\nservice volume relative to certified capacity that resulted in an overall net\nloss in the program. These adjustments are approvable solely at the discretion\nof the Office and will require compelling justification relative to the\nprogram's underutilization. MSIW beds that were used as \"swing beds\" for other\nprograms (e.g., Medically Monitored Inpatient Withdrawal) do not constitute\nunderutilization and will not justify a fee increase. (2)\n\nOther items of appeal. MSIW providers may\nalso request retroactive fee adjustments based on significant financial losses\nin the program that resulted from programmatic expenses that were significantly\nout of proportion to the established level of reimbursement. The provider must\nfully and properly demonstrate that the fee adjustment requested in the appeal\nis necessary to ensure efficient and economic operation of the facility. The\nfinal determination as to the extent, if any, of a fee adjustment shall be made\nsolely at the discretion of the Office. (e) Base year. From time to time, and at the\ndiscretion of the Office, the fee calculation may be revised using new base\nyear data. The base year for new fee calculations will be the most recent, substantially complete Consolidated Fiscal Report period available at the time\nof the calculation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
