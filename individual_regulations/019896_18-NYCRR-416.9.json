  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 416.9 - Behavior management\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The group family day care licensee must\nestablish and follow a written plan for behavior management that is acceptable\nto the office. This plan must include how the program will approach challenging\nbehaviors, help children solve problems, and encourage acceptable\nbehaviors. (b) The caregivers must\nuse acceptable techniques and approaches to help children solve\nproblems. (c) The program must\nprovide copies of the behavior management plan to all caregivers and\nparents. (d) Discipline must\npromote positive self-esteem in children and guide children in such a way as to\nhelp each child develop self-control and assume responsibility for his or her\nactions through clear and consistent rules and limits appropriate to the ages\nand development of the children in care. (e) Any discipline used must relate to the\nchild's action and be handled without prolonged delay on the part of the\ncaregiver so that the child is aware of the relationship between his or her\nactions and the consequences of those actions. (f) Isolating a child in a closet, darkened\narea, or any area where the child cannot be seen and supervised by the\ncaregiver is prohibited. (g) When a\nchild's behavior harms or is likely to result in harm to the child, others or\nproperty, or seriously disrupts or is likely to seriously disrupt group\ninteraction, the child may be separated briefly from the group, but only for as\nlong as is necessary for the child to regain enough self-control to rejoin the\ngroup. The child must be placed in an area where he or she is in the view of, and can be supervised and supported by a caregiver. Interaction between a\ncaregiver and the child must take place immediately following the separation to\nguide the child toward appropriate group behavior. Separation of a child from\nthe group in a manner other than that provided for herein is\nprohibited. (h) Physical\nrestraint is prohibited. Physical restraint is the act of using force to extremely\nlimit a child's body movements for a lengthy period of time. It involves\nholding a child against his/her will and putting pressure on the child's chest\nand/or extremities in an effort to significantly restrict his/her movement, thereby making it extremely difficult for a child to move. It may also involve\nholding a child flat on the ground and restricting his/her body from\nmovement. (i) Physical\nintervention is permitted. Physical intervention is the act of using bodily contact\nas a short- term immediate response to prevent children from incurring\nsubstantial or serious injury to themselves or injuring others. It may involve: picking a child up and moving him or her away from danger or conflict, holding\nthe child's hands or gently touching the body to direct their movement, rocking\na child to soothe them, blocking a child's path when they are about to injure\nthemselves or others or destroy property. This technique allows the child to\nregain self-control as quickly and safely as possible. A consultation with a\nchild's parent is required if the child is not receptive to physical\nintervention. (j) Corporal punishment is prohibited. For the purposes of this Part, the term\ncorporal\npunishment\nmeans punishment inflicted directly on the body including, but not limited to, physical restraint, spanking, biting, shaking, slapping, twisting or squeezing; demanding excessive physical exercise, prolonged lack of\nmovement or motion, or strenuous or bizarre postures; and compelling a child to\neat or have in the child's mouth soap, hot spices, irritants or the\nlike. (k) Withholding or\nusing food, rest or sleep as a punishment is prohibited. (l) A child may only be disciplined by a\ncaregiver. (m) Methods of\ndiscipline, interaction or toilet training which frighten, demean or humiliate\na child are prohibited. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
