The number of designated seating positions\nprovided. (b) Designated seating\nposition.

(c) Fifth percentile adult female. A person\npossessing the dimensions and weight of the fifth percentile adult female\nspecified for the total age group in Public Health Service Publication No. 1000, Series 11, No. 8, Weight, Height and Selected Body Dimensions of\n\nAdults. (d) \"H\" point. The\nmechanically hinged hip point of a manikin which simulates the actual pivot\ncenter of the human torso and thigh, described in SAE Recommended Practice\nJ826, Manikins for Use in Defining Vehicle Seating Accommodations, November\n1962. (e) Head impact area. All\nnonglazed surfaces of the interior of a vehicle that are statically contactable\nby a 6.5-inch diameter spherical head form of a form of a measuring device\nhaving a pivot point to \"top-of-head\" dimension infinitely adjustable from 29\nto 33 inches in accordance with the following procedure, or its graphic\nequivalent: (1)\n\nAt each designated seating\nposition, place the pivot point of the measuring device: (i) for seats that are adjustable fore and\naft, at: (a) the seating reference point; and\n(b) a point five inches\nhorizontally forward of the seating reference point and vertically above the\nseating reference point, an amount equal to the rise which results from a\nfive-inch forward adjustment of the seat or 0.75 inch; and\n(ii)\nfor seats that are not adjustable fore\nand aft, at the seating reference point. (2)\n\nWith the pivot point to \"top-of-head\"\ndimension of each value allowed by the device and the interior dimensions of\nthe vehicle, determine all contact points above the lower windshield glass line\nand forward of the seating reference point. (3)\n\nWith the head form at each contact point, and with the device in a vertical position if no contact point exists for a\nparticular adjusted length, pivot the measuring device forward and downward\nthrough all arcs in vertical planes to 90° each side of the vertical\nlongitudinal plane through the seating reference point, until the head form\ncontacts an interior surface or until it is tangent to a horizontal plane one\ninch above the seating reference point, whichever occurs first. (f) Instrument pane. That\nstructure between the front seats and the windshield, above, but not attached\nto, the floor and toe pan, between the forward door posts, except the steering\ncolumn and attachments thereto. (g) Motor vehicle. Every motor vehicle as defined by section\n125\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law, except motorcycles. (h) Multi-purpose passenger vehicle.

A\nmotor vehicle, except a multi-purpose passenger vehicle, designed for carrying\n10 persons or less. (j) Pelvic\nimpact area. That area of the door or body side adjacent to any outboard\ndesignated seating position which is bounded by horizontal planes 7 inches\nabove and 4 inches below the seating reference point and vertical transverse\nplanes 8 inches forward and 2 inches rearward of the seating reference\npoint. (k) Seating reference point. The manufacturer's design reference point which: (1)\nestablishes the rearmost normal design\ndriving or riding position of each designated seating position in a\nvehicle; (2)\nhas coordinates\nestablished relative to the designated vehicle structure; (3)\nsimulates the position of the pivot\ncenter of the human torso and thigh; and\n(4)\nis the reference point employed to\nposition the two dimensional templates described in SAE Recommended Practice\nJ826, Manikins for Use in Defining Vehicle Seating Accommodations, November\n1962. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n55.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
