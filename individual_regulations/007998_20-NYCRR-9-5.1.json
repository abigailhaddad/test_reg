  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 9-5.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, sections 208(1) and (9)(i), 209(6))\n(a) For purposes of article 9-A, a DISC is\neither a \"tax exempt DISC\" or a \"taxable DISC\". For any taxable year during\nwhich a corporation does not meet the requirements for treatment as a DISC, it\nwill be treated in the same manner as any other taxpayer subject to tax under\narticle 9-A. (b) The term \"former\nDISC\" refers, with respect to any taxable year, to a corporation that is not a\nDISC during such year, but was (or was treated as) a DISC for a prior taxable\nyear. However, a corporation will not be considered a former DISC for a taxable\nyear unless such corporation has, at the beginning of such taxable year, undistributed previously taxed income or accumulated DISC income. (c) To determine if a taxpayer that is a\nstockholder of a taxable DISC may be included in a combined report with the\ntaxable DISC, see Subpart 6-2 of this Subchapter. Provided, in the case of a\ncombined report, intercorporate dividends from a taxable DISC or a taxable\nformer DISC are treated as business income and shall not be\neliminated. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
