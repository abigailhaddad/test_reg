  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 700.4 - Obligations of the attorney\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Attorneys are both officers of the\ncourt and advocates. It is their professional obligation to conduct each case\ncourageously, vigorously, and with all the skill and knowledge they possess. It\nis also their obligation to uphold the honor and maintain the dignity of the\nprofession. They must avoid disorder or disruption in the courtroom and must\nmaintain a respectful attitude toward the court. In all respects attorneys are\nbound, in court and out, by the provisions of the Rules of Professional\n\nConduct. (b) Attorneys shall use their best efforts to dissuade their client and witnesses\nfrom causing disorder or disruption in the courtroom. (c) Attorneys shall not engage\nin any examination which is intended merely to harass, annoy or humiliate the\nwitness. (d) No\nattorney shall argue in support of or against an objection without permission\nfrom the court; nor shall any attorney argue with respect to a ruling of the\ncourt on any objection without such permission. However, an attorney may make a\nconcise statement of the particular grounds for an objection or exception, not\notherwise apparent, where it is necessary to do so in order to call the court's\nattention thereto, or to preserve an issue for appellate review. If an attorney\nbelieves in good faith that the court has wrongly made an adverse ruling, he or\nshe may respectfully request reconsideration thereof. (e) Attorneys have neither the\nright nor duty to execute any directive of a client which is not consistent\nwith the Rules of Professional Conduct set forth in Part 1200 of this Title. Nor may attorneys advise another to do any act or to engage in any conduct in\nany manner contrary to these rules. (f) Once a client has employed an\nattorney who has entered an appearance, the attorney shall not withdraw or\nabandon the case without: (1)\njustifiable cause; (2)\nreasonable notice to the client; and\n(3)\npermission\nof the court. (g) Attorneys are not relieved of these\nobligations by what they may regard as a deficiency in the conduct or ruling of\na judge or in the system of justice; nor are they relieved of these obligations\nby what they believe to be the moral, political, social, or ideological merits\nof the cause of any client.
