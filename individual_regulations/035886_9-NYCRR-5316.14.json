In such a case, the window shall be less than one\nsecond. (b) Resumption. On program\nresumption, the following procedures shall be performed, at a minimum: (1)\nany communications to an external device\nshall not begin until the program resumption routine, including self-tests, is\ncompleted successfully; (2)\nkiosk\ncontrol programs shall test themselves for possible corruption due to failure\nof the program storage media.
