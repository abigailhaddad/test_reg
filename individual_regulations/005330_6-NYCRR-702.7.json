Tit. 6 § 702.7 - Procedure for deriving standards and guidance values based on chemical correlation\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf the available data are deemed insufficient for\nderiving a standard or guidance value on the basis of either of sections 702.4\nor\n702.5\nof this Part, a standard or\nguidance value may be based on correlation to a chemical for which a standard\nor guidance value has been established pursuant to those sections. Standards or\nguidance values based on chemical correlation may be established if similar\ntoxic effects are anticipated because of similarity of functional groups or\nmetabolic or toxicologic pathways. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n702.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
