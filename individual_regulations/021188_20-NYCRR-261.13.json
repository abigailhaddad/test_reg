  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 261.13 - Change from accrual to installment method of accounting\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 5(d)(3) of § 1340(c); Codes and Ordinances of\nthe City of Yonkers, § 92-102(d)(3)\n(a) General. If a nonresident taxpayer has changed his method of\naccounting from an accrual to an installment method for Federal income tax\npurposes, any installment payments actually received in the year of change or\nin subsequent taxable years (such year or years being referred to as\n\"adjustment years\"), on account of sales or other dispositions of property made\nin any taxable year prior to the year of the change, are required to be\nincluded in Federal net earnings from self-employment, and consequently are\nincluded in City of Yonkers net earnings from self-employment. Therefore, profits attributable to installment sales which were taxed in the year of sale\nbecause the taxpayer was then on the accrual method of accounting would also be\ntaxed in the adjustment years (\ni.e., during the years the\ninstallments are actually received after the change to the installment method\nof accounting). To avoid such duplication of City of Yonkers earnings tax, any\nadditional tax for the adjustment years attributable to the receipt of\ninstallment payments properly accrued in a prior year must be reduced by an\namount equal to the portion of the City of Yonkers earnings tax for any year or\nyears preceding the year of change attributable to the prior accrual of income\nfrom installment sales included in City of Yonkers net earnings in the\nadjustment years. (b) Reduction in City of Yonkers earnings tax for adjustment year. To give effect to the foregoing, the City of Yonkers\nearnings tax for an adjustment year must be reduced by the lower of the\nfollowing amounts: (1)\nthat proportion\nof the City of Yonkers earnings tax for the prior year (in which the\ninstallment sales were reported on the accrual basis) which the amount of\ninstallment sales gross profits reportable in the prior year of the sale and in\nthe adjustment year bears to the City of Yonkers net earnings for such prior\nyear of sale; or\n(2)\nthe excess, if\nany, of the amount of City of Yonkers earnings tax for the adjustment year on\nthe entire City of Yonkers earnings, over the amount of the City of Yonkers\nearnings tax for such year, computed without regard to the amount of the\ninstallment sales gross profits reported in both the prior year of accrual and\nin the adjustment year. Where previously reported installments received in an\nadjustment year include installments on sales made in more than one prior year, the reduction allowable with respect to the installments for each prior year\nmust be computed separately. In such a case, the excess City of Yonkers\nearnings tax, calculated under paragraph (2) of this subdivision, computed with\nrespect to the installments from all prior years, must be prorated over the\nseveral prior years in proportion to the amount of the duplicated installment\nsales profits attributable to each such prior year. (c) Change by a partnership from\naccrual to installment method of accounting. In the case of a change by a partnership from the accrual\nmethod of accounting to the installment method of accounting, partnership\nincome includes, for each adjustment year, any installment payments actually\nreceived in such year, even though such amounts were included in partnership\nincome for prior years under the accrual method. Each partner must determine\nseparately his distributive share of profits attributable to installment\npayments included in partnership income in the year of sale and in any\nadjustment year, and must compute his City of Yonkers earnings tax reduction\nwith respect thereto in accordance with the provisions of this\nsection. (d) Statement to be attached to City of Yonkers earnings tax return. A nonresident taxpayer who changes from the accrual\nmethod of accounting to the installment method of accounting must attach a\nstatement to the City of Yonkers earnings tax return for each adjustment year. This statement must show: (1)\nthe\npertinent facts as to sales in each year preceding the year of\nchange; (2)\nthe number of remaining\ntaxable years over which it will be necessary to compute adjustments; and\n(3)\na schedule showing the\ncomputation of the adjustment for the taxable year.
