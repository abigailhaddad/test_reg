Tit. 14 § 521.6 - Title requirements for property\n\nState Regulations\n(a) At the time of receiving a State aid\ngrant, the applicant must be able to demonstrate to the Office of Mental Health\nthat the applicant will possess property rights over the facility that are of\nsufficient quality and are for the requisite duration. (1)\n\nFor the purposes of this subdivision, the\nfollowing definitions shall apply: (i) Possession of property rights means that these rights are presently held by the\napplicant or that the applicant is under contract to acquire them. (ii)\n\nProperty rights means the ability to\npossess and use the premises and includes a fee simple, a fee on limitation, a\nrental agreement, a contract, a contract coupled with possession or a\ncooperative interest. (iii)\n\nSufficient quality means that the applicant will be able to utilize the\nproperty for the intended purpose without the risk of losing rights to the\nproperty. It is such an interest, when viewed in conjunction with recorded\ndocuments or secured contractual agreements, which provides for undisturbed use\nand possession for the purposes of the facility. (iv)\n\nRequisite duration means that the\napplicant can use the premises for the period of time required for program\noperation at the facility. This period of time is specified in section\n521.10\n(a)(6)\nof\nthis Part. (2)\n\nThe\ncommissioner may, upon written application and in his sole discretion, pay a\nlimited portion of the State aid grant prior to the time the applicant is able\nto demonstrate the presence of the title characteristics required by this\nsubdivision. The applicant's prospective ability to demonstrate the required\ntitle characteristics must be established in such a manner as is required by\nthe commissioner in each case. Payment may be made in whatever form the\ncommissioner determines to be necessary to protect the interest of the\nOMH. (b) Based upon the\ntype of interest, the possession of property rights must be demonstrated to the\n\nOffice of Mental Health as detailed below: (1)\nA fee interest in real property, requires the submission to the Office of\n\nMental Health of a copy of a title insurance policy and a counsel's opinion\nletter. (i) The title insurance may be a\nfinal policy or a marked title report. It must certify the applicant's interest\nin the property. (ii)\nA survey and\na survey reading must be included in the policy. If the survey was last updated\nmore than 90 days before the acquisition of the property, a current survey\ninspection is required, unless the property is located in a\ncondominium. (iii)\n\nCounsel's\nopinion letter must certify that the applicable recorded documents, declaration\nof condominium, bylaws and protective covenants, as well as zoning ordinances\nand local regulations have been examined and that the interest held is of\nsufficient quality and for the requisite duration. (2)\nA lease or a contract to acquire an\ninterest in real property requires submission of documents and the applicant's\ncounsel's opinion letter. (i) The documents\nrequired include copies of the recorded lease agreement and/or memorandum of\nlease or contract to purchase. (ii)\n\nCounsel's legal opinion letter must certify that the interest, in conjunction\nwith any documents of record, including recorded mortgage instruments, is of\nsufficient quality and for the requisite duration. (3)\n\nCooperative interests and contracts to\nacquire them, such as a subscription agreement or a contract to purchase, require that the applicant investigate the rules governing the interest and\nsubmit the applicant's counsel's legal opinion letter. (i) The applicant should assure that the\nproprietary lease runs for a period greater than the period of time required\nfor the operation of the facility; the proprietary lease permits subletting\nand/or transient subletting; default provisions based on occupant behavior; allow for removal of the occupant/subtenant rather than loss of the applicant's\ninterest; and, these rights are stated in the certificate of incorporation of\nthe cooperative corporation and its bylaws and are protected by appropriate\nsupra-majority amendment provisions. These matters may be determined through\ninvestigation of the prospectus as currently amended, and confirmed in the\ndocuments listed above. (ii)\n\nCounsel's legal opinion letter must certify that the interest is of sufficient\nquality and for the requisite duration. It must contain specific citation of\nthe portions of the relevant documentation upon which the legal opinion was\nbased, in addition to copies of such supporting documentation (e.g., the\ncertificate of incorporation, the bylaws, the proprietary lease and/or the\nprospectus). (4)\n\nThe\napplicant for a Housing Finance Agency mortgage loan must have or will have, at\nthe time the Housing Finance Agency mortgage is executed and delivered, a fee\nsimple including necessary easements and rights-of-way free and clear of all\ncovenants, mortgages, easements and encumbrances, sufficient to assure\nundisturbed use and possession for the purposes of the facility.
