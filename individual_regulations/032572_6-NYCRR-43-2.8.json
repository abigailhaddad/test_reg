(d) The owner of a vessel assigned an\nindividual fishing quota shall be eligible to purchase cage tags from the\ndepartment or from the department or from a vendor authorized by the\ndepartment. The number of cage tags will be based on the IFQ assigned to a\nvessel on an annual basis and the containers used to land surfclams. The holder\nof an IFQ must complete a declaration annually that specifies whether the\nsurfclams taken from the certified waters of the Atlantic Ocean will be landed\nin standard cages or industry standard bushel containers. Each cage tag\nrepresents either 32 industry standard bushels of surfclam allocation held in\nstandard cages or one industry standard bushel of surfclam allocation, or a\nportion thereof.

Immediately following written\nnotification to the department, the reported tags shall no longer be valid for\nuse pursuant to this section. (g) Lost or stolen tags may be replaced by the department or an authorized vendor\nif proper notice of the loss is provided by the person to whom the tags were\nissued.
