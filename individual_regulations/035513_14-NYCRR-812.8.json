Whenever it is determined that a\ncovered provider may not be in compliance with the requirements of section\n812.4 or\n812.5\nof this Part and has not\nobtained a waiver, the provider shall be notified in writing of the basis for\nthat determination. Such notice shall provide the covered provider with an\nopportunity and a procedure to submit additional or clarifying information\nwithin 30 calendar days of the provider's receipt of such notice to demonstrate\ncompliance with this Part. Failure to submit additional or clarifying\ninformation within the required time period shall result in the determination\nof non-compliance becoming final. (b) Corrective action period. If the\ndetermination of non-compliance becomes final as set forth in subdivision (a)\nof this section or if the office or its designee determines, after reviewing\nand considering any information submitted by the covered provider, that such\nprovider is not in compliance with the requirements of section 812.4 or\n812.5\nof this regulation, the\nprovider shall receive notice of such determination and a notice to cure. Such\nnotice shall allow the covered provider a period of not less than six months to\ncorrect the violation(s) identified (the corrective action period) prior to\nadditional enforcement action or penalties being imposed, and shall require\nthat the covered provider submit within 30 calendar days a corrective action\nplan (CAP) for approval by the office or its designee. (c) Corrective action plan. Within 30\ncalendar days of receipt of the covered provider's CAP, the office or its\ndesignee shall either approve such CAP or request clarification or alterations. The covered provider shall make such alterations to the CAP as may be\nreasonably required by the office or its designee. Once the CAP has been\napproved and the covered provider notified, and unless otherwise provided in\nthe approved CAP, the covered provider shall have six months to complete the\nCAP and comply with this Part. (d) Failure to cure. At the conclusion of the period for implementation of an\napproved CAP, the office or its designee may request information from the\ncovered provider to determine whether the CAP has been fully and properly\ncompleted. If it has been so completed, the matter shall be considered closed\nand no further action on the part of the office or the provider shall be\nrequired. If the office or its designee determines that the CAP has not been\nfully and properly implemented within the designated corrective action period, the office or its designee shall provide written notice to the provider and may\ntake one or more of the following actions, taking into account the seriousness\nof the violations, the nature of the provider's services, and the provider's\nefforts to correct the violations, if any: (1)\n\nAt its sole discretion, modify the CAP\nand/or extend the time for the provider to complete implementation. (2)\n\nIssue a final determination of\nnon-compliance, together with a notice of the sanctions which the office seeks\nto impose. Such sanctions may include: (i) redirection of State funds or State-authorized payments to be used to provide\nprogram services, where possible and consistent with federal and state\nlaws; (ii)\nsuspension, modification, limitation, or revocation of the provider's license(s) to operate\nprogram(s) for the delivery of program services; (iii)\nsuspension, modification or termination\nof contracts or other agreements with the covered provider; and\n(iv)\nany other lawful actions or penalties\ndeemed appropriate by the office or its designee. (e) Opportunity for appeal. Within\n30 calendar days of receipt of a final determination of noncompliance and\nnotice of proposed sanctions, a covered provider may request an administrative\nappeal by submitting a written request to the name and address set forth in the\nnotice. The request must include a detailed explanation of the legal and\nfactual bases for the provider's challenge to the determination and all\ndocumentation in support of the provider's position. If a request for an\nadministrative appeal is not made within the required ten business days, the\ndetermination of noncompliance shall become final and the proposed sanction\nshall be imposed. Unless the office seeks to impose a sanction for which an\nadministrative hearing is otherwise required by statute or regulation, covered\nthe provider's appeal shall be limited to an administrative review of the\nrecord. Following the review, the covered provider shall be provided with a\nfinal written determination setting forth the findings of fact and conclusions\nof law that support the determination. If the provider is found to be\nnon-compliant, the proposed sanction may be imposed forthwith. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
