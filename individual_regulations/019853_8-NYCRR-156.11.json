  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 156.11 - Appropriate costs for a transportation contract\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll contracts for the transportation of children authorized\npursuant to paragraph (h) of subdivision 25 of section\n1709\nof the\n\nEducation Law, and not specifically authorized by any other section of law, shall be subject to a test of \"appropriate cost\" pursuant to this\nsection. (a) In determining the\nappropriate transportation contract cost, the transportation service provider\nschool district shall demonstrate that the contract reflects the true costs\nthat a prudent person would incur in a competitive transportation business by\ncalculating the contract cost based on the appropriate unit cost determined in\naccordance with subdivision (b) of this section. (b) An appropriate unit cost for the proposed\ntransportation service shall be determined by dividing the grand total of\ntransportation expenditures for the preceding school year of all regular\ntransportation services provided to students of the district by the service\nprovider school district by the number of vehicles, passengers, miles traveled\nor other appropriate transportation service units represented by all such\ntransportation services. The proposed transportation contract costs shall\nsatisfy the test of \"appropriate cost\" required by this section if such\nproposed transportation contract costs are equal to the product of such\nresulting, appropriate unit cost and the number of comparable service units to\nbe provided under the proposed contract. The grand total of transportation\nexpenditures used in this calculation shall include all expenses that would be\neligible for transportation aid if they were incurred under a transportation\ncontract with a private contractor, including but not limited to the\ntransportation related costs of operation, maintenance and repair of vehicles, fringe benefits, buildings, utilities, depreciation, training, insurance, interest payments, and administration. Written documentation of specific\nexpenditures of the school district included in the grand total of\ntransportation expenditures and the service units used in such calculations\nshall be retained by the transportation service provider school district for a\nperiod of at least three years after the termination of such contracted\ntransportation service and shall be available for public inspection. (c) This section shall not apply to the\ntransportation of children of school age provided pursuant to provisions of the\n\nEducation Law other than Education Law, section\n1709\n(25)(h), including but not limited to subdivision 24, paragraph (g) of subdivision 25 or\nsubdivision 27 of section\n1709\nof the Education Law.
