  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 105.12 - Change other than from accrual to installment method of accounting\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 605(a)(4)(B)\n(a) Where a taxpayer's method of accounting\nis changed, other than from an accrual to an installment method, there must be\ntaken into account in computing New York taxable income for the taxable year of\nthe change (or in the taxable years such change is recognized for Federal\nincome tax purposes) those adjustments pertaining to inventories, accounts\nreceivable, accounts payable, etc., which are determined to be necessary to\nprevent amounts from being duplicated or omitted. Where the change has occurred\nby reason of a change in such taxpayer's method of accounting for Federal\nincome tax purposes, the adjustments will generally be reflected in such\ntaxpayer's Federal adjusted gross income and itemized deductions and therefore\nin such taxpayer's New York adjusted gross income and itemized deduction. The\nyear of the change is the taxable year for which the taxable income of the\ntaxpayer is computed under a method of accounting different from that used for\nthe preceding year. (b) (1)\n\nThe adjustments necessitated by reason of\nsuch change in accounting method may result in an amount of New York State\npersonal income tax for the year of the change in excess of the New York State\npersonal income tax which would have been determined had there not been such a\nchange in the method of accounting. In such event, the additional New York\n\nState personal income tax shall not be greater than if such adjustments were\nratably allocated and included for the taxable year of the change and the\npreceding taxable years, not in excess of two, during which the taxpayer used\nthe method of accounting from which the change was made. (2)\n\nThe taxpayer must submit a statement with\nsuch taxpayer's New York State personal income tax return for the year of the\nchange, setting forth the following information and calculations: (i) each adjustment necessitated by the\nchange; (ii)\nthe net amount of the\nadjustments. This means the consolidation of the adjustments (whether the\namounts thereof represent increases or decreases in items of income or\ndeductions) arising with respect to balances in various accounts at the\nbeginning of the taxable year of the change. Where the change in the method of\naccounting occurs by reason of a change for Federal income tax purposes, the\nnet amount of the adjustment must be the same for New York State personal\nincome tax purposes as it is for Federal income tax purposes, except to the\nextent of any modifications required by this Subchapter pertaining to such\nadjustments; (iii)\n\nThe New York\n\nState personal income tax for the taxable year of the change with the net\namount of the adjustments included in the computation of New York taxable\nincome; (iv)\nthe New York State\npersonal income tax for the taxable year of the change computed as if the net\namount of the adjustments were not included in the computation of New York\ntaxable income; (v) the additional\n\nNew York State personal income tax, if any, incurred solely by reason of the\nnet amount of the adjustments included in New York taxable income, computed by\nsubtracting subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph from subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph; (vi)\nthe allocation of\nthe net amount of the adjustments (subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph) to the\ntaxable year of the change and the preceding taxable year or years, not in\nexcess of two, during which the taxpayer used the method of accounting from\nwhich the change is made. The amount to be allocated to each such year is\ndetermined by dividing the net amount of the adjustments into as many equal\nparts as there are taxable years involved (either two taxable years or three\ntaxable years, including the taxable year of the change); (vii)\nthe New York taxable income for the\nyear of the change and for the preceding year or two years, as the case may be, computed both (\na\n) without any amount of the net adjustments, and (\nb\n) with the addition of the appropriate share of the net\nadjustments as determined under subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph; (viii)\nthe additional New York State personal\nincome tax which would result for each of the above taxable years by the\naddition to the New York taxable income in each such year of the appropriate\nshare of the net adjustments; and\n(ix)\nthe total amount of such additional New\n\nYork State personal income tax for the years involved. (3)\n\nIf the amount described in subparagraph\n(ix) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision exceeds the amount described in\nsubparagraph (v) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the taxpayer must\ncompute such taxpayer's New York State personal income tax for the year of the\nchange without a ratable allocation of the net adjustments to any preceding\nyear or years. If the amount described in such subparagraph (v) exceeds the\namount described in such subparagraph (ix), the amount of the excess must be\nsubtracted from the New York State personal income tax for the year of the\nchange as determined under subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. The result is the amount of New York State personal income tax due\nfor the taxable year of the change. Example: Assume that a resident individual entitled to claim\nhead of household filing status and one dependent exemption used the cash\nmethod in 1990 and 1991. In 1992 such taxpayer changes to the accrual basis, has New York adjusted gross income of $119,150 and has New York taxable income\nof $110,000 figured on the accrual basis. Such taxpayer's books at the\nbeginning of 1992 included the following accounts: accounts receivable of\n$9,000; accounts payable of $8,000; inventory of $5,000. The amount of New York\n\nState personal income tax due for the taxable year of the change is computed in\nthe following manner: Subject to the amount of any modifications required\nunder this Subchapter, the New York taxable income for the year of the change, including the net amount of adjustments (see subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision), would be determined as follows: New York taxable income on accrual basis (new\nmethod but before adjustments)\n$110,000\n(i) Adjustments: Add: Items not previously reported as\nincome: Accounts receivable, January 1, 1992\n$ 9,000\n\nItems previously deducted but constituting\nmarketable business assets: Inventory, January 1, 1992\n5,000\n\nTotal to be added\n$14,000\n\nSubtract: Items not previously deducted: Accounts\npayable, January 1, 1992\n8,000\n(ii) Net amount of adjustments (increase)\n6,000\n\nNew York taxable income after adjustments\n$116,000\n\nThe net additional New York State personal income tax\ndue (including the supplemental tax relating to the tax table benefit\nrecapture) for the year of the change described in subparagraph (v) of\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision is determined as follows: (iii)\n\nNew York State personal income tax due (including\nsupplemental tax) for the year of change, including the net amount of\nadjustments ($116,000)\n$8,894.58\n(iv)\n\nNew York State personal income tax due (including\nsupplemental tax) for taxable year of change, excluding above adjustments\n($10,000)\n8,364.03\n(v) New additional New York State personal income tax\ndue\n$ 530.55\n\nSince the taxpayer used the cash method of the two\nyears preceding the changeover year and the adjustments for 1992 increased New\n\nYork adjusted gross income and New York taxable income by $6,000, the taxpayer\nmay reduce the New York State personal income tax on the increase by allocating\n$2,000 to 1990, $2,000 to 1991, and $2,000 to 1992 (see subparagraphs (vi)\nthrough (viii) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision). The net New York State\npersonal income tax (including the supplemental tax relating to the tax table\nbenefit recapture) due for the year of change is then determined in the\nfollowing manner: Taxable year\n\nNew York taxable income before\nadjustments\n\nNew York taxable income after\nadjustments\n\nNew York State personal income tax\n(including supplemental tax) before adjustments\n\nNew York State personal income tax\n(including supplemental tax) after adjustments\n\nNew York State personal income tax\ndue to adjustments\n1990\n$ 11,000\n$ 13,000\n$ 475.00\n$ 595.00\n$120.00\n1991\n18,000\n20,000\n933.75\n1,091.25\n157.50\n1992\n110,000\n112,000\n8,364.03\n8,540.88\n176.85\n\nTotal increase in New York State personal income\ntax attributable to adjustments (see subparagraph [ix] of paragraph [2] of this\nsubdivision)\n$ 454.35\n\nNet additional New York State personal income tax\ndetermined at subparagraph (v) of this paragraph\n$ 530.55\n\nExcess ($530.55 - $454.35)\n$ 76.20\n\nTotal New York State personal income tax\ndetermined at subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph\n$8,894.58\n\nExcess shown above\n76.20\n\nNew York State personal income tax (including the\nsupplemental tax due for the year of change)\n$8,818.38\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
