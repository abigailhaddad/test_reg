  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 248-3.1 - Compliance requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Vehicles with an engine certified to the applicable 2007 EPA standard for\nparticulate matter (0.01 g/bhp-hr) as set forth in section 86.007 -11 of title\n40 of the Code of Federal Regulations or to the applicable 2007 CARB standard\nfor particulate matter shall be deemed to be in compliance with this Part (see\n\nTable 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). (b) Heavy duty vehicles retrofitted with a\nEPA or CARB verified or an approved diesel retrofit technology device prior to\n\nFebruary 12, 2007 shall be deemed to be in compliance with this Part provided\nthe device is maintained throughout the HDV's useful life. (c) Approved bi-fuel vehicles shall be deemed\nto be in compliance with this Part. (d) All covered vehicles owned by, operated\nby or on behalf of, or leased by a regulated entity or contractor shall be\npowered by ULSD fuel. The regulated entity or contractor may apply for a waiver\nfrom this requirement per the waiver application process specified in section\n248-4.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart if the commissioner makes a written finding that a sufficient quantity of\nULSD is not available to meet the requirements of this Part. (e) As of December 31, 2019, all diesel\npowered heavy duty vehicles owned by, operated by or on behalf of, or leased by\neach BART regulated entity or which are owned by, operated by or leased by a\ncontractor and used to provide labor, services, materials and/or equipment on\nbehalf of a BART regulated entity to perform regulated entity work shall\nutilize and maintain BART. (f) In\norder to comply with the requirements of subdivision (e) of this section, the\nBART regulated entity or contractor shall first perform a HDV inventory\naccording to a department prescribed format. The BART regulated entity or\ncontractor shall then select one of the following three options for each of its\ninventoried HDVs: (1)\n\nOption 1 - replacement\nor retirement: (i) replacement/re-power with\nan engine certified to the applicable 2007 EPA standard for particulate matter\n(0.01 g/bhp-hr) as set forth in section 86.007 - 11 of title 40 of the Code of\n\nFederal Regulations (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) or to any\nsubsequent USEPA standard for such pollutant that is at least as stringent; or\n(ii)\nreplacement with an\nalternative fuel engine or vehicle which does not operate on diesel fuel; model\nyear 2004 - 2006 alternative fuel engines must be certified to the optional, reduced emission standards as specified in title 13, California Code of\n\nRegulations, section 1956.8(a)(2)(A) (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title); or\n(iii)\nretirement of the vehicle or removal of\nthe vehicle's engine. (2)\n\nOption 2 - BART evaluation and selection\nprocess: (i) BART shall be selected from the\ndiesel retrofit technologies (products) verified by either the EPA or\nCARB. (ii)\n\nThe specific procedures\nfor evaluating and selecting BART for each applicable HDV are as follows: (a) The BART regulated entity or contractor\nshall review the EPA and CARB list of BART classification level 3 products to\ndetermine if any of the classification level 3 products are applicable and\navailable for the inventoried specific HDV engine and application. In no case\nshall a product(s) be selected which results in a net increase in the emissions\nof either PM or NO\nx. (b) If more than one classification level 3\nproduct is applicable and available and the product(s) provides an additional\nNO\nx\nreduction benefit, a cost analysis shall be\nperformed in accordance with clause (c) of this subparagraph. (c) If the cost of the product(s) that\nprovides the greatest NO\nx\nreduction is less than or\nequal to 30 percent more than that of the other applicable and available\nclassification level 3 products, then the product(s) with the greatest\nNO\nx\nreduction shall be selected. For the purpose of the\ncost analysis, criteria that shall be considered are the cost of the products\nthemselves and the cost of installation. (d) If more than one classification level 3\nproduct is applicable and available and none of which contain an additional\nNO\nx\nreduction benefit, then any of those applicable and\navailable classification level 3 products may be selected. (e) If no classification level 3 product is\ndetermined applicable and available for use on a specific HDV engine and\napplication, then the BART regulated entity or contractor shall continue the\nevaluation and selection process for classification level 2 products as\nindicated in clause (f) of this subparagraph. (f) The same evaluation and selection process\nas noted in clauses (a) through (d) of this subparagraph performed for\nclassification level 3 products shall be performed for classification level 2\nproducts. (g) If no classification\nlevel 2 product is determined applicable and available for use on a specific\nHDV engine and application, then the BART regulated entity or contractor shall\ncontinue the evaluation and selection process for classification level 1\nproducts as indicated in clause (h) of this subparagraph. (h) The same evaluation and selection process\nas noted in clauses (a) through (d) of this subparagraph, performed for\nclassification level 3 products shall be performed for classification level 1\nproducts. (i) If no classification\nlevel 1 product is determined applicable and available for use on a specific\nHDV engine and application, then the BART regulated entity or contractor shall\napply for a waiver for the specific HDV according to the procedures specified\nin section\n248-4.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nOption 3 - heavy duty vehicle/engine useful life waiver. Provisions for\nobtaining a heavy duty vehicle/engine useful life waiver are described in\nsection\n248-4.1\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (g) The BART\nregulated entity and contractor: (1)\nshall\nfully document all steps in the option 1 or 2 selection process as noted in\nsubdivision (f) of this section; (2)\nmake available or provide all\ndocumentation to the department upon its request; and\n(3)\nshall retain all documentation generated\nin the option 1 or 2 selection process for five years or as long as the\nselected option is in use, whichever is longer. (h) A contractor's failure to fully document\nthe option 1 or 2 selection process or to provide such documentation shall be\nconsidered a violation of subdivision (f) of this section and is subject to\napplicable penalties. (i) All\ncontracts to provide labor, services, materials and/or equipment on behalf of a\nregulated entity to enable it to perform regulated entity work shall require\nthe contractor to comply with the requirements of this Part. (j) If an option 1 technology is selected and\ninstalled, then the selected technology shall remain in use for the remainder\nof the vehicle's or engine's useful life, or, in the case of a contractor for\nthe duration of the regulated entity work. If the selected engine or vehicle\nexperiences a failure, then the BART regulated entity or contractor shall\nselect and install for replacement: (1)\nan\noption 1 technology; or\n(2)\nan\noption 2 technology using the evaluation and selection process in accordance\nwith paragraph (f)(2) of this section. (k) If an option 2 technology is selected and\ninstalled, then the selected BART product shall remain in use until the end of\nthe vehicle's or engine's useful life, or, in the case of a contractor for the\nduration of the regulated entity work at a minimum. If the selected and\ninstalled BART product experiences a failure, then the BART regulated entity or\ncontractor shall select and install: (1)\nthe\nsame BART product; or\n(2)\na BART\nproduct using the evaluation and selection process in accordance with paragraph\n(f)(2) of this section; or\n(3)\nan\noption 1 technology. (l) For HDVs that meet the applicability requirements of this Part and are subject\nto the consent decree, those HDVs must: (1)\nhave the approved low NO\nx\nrebuild kits installed. Low\nNO\nx\n\nRebuild Kits shall be installed on the vehicle's\nengine prior to the installation of any classification level 1, 2 or 3 BART\ndevice; and\n(2)\nhave readily\nobservable low NO\nx\nrebuild labels permanently affixed to\ntheir respective engines.
