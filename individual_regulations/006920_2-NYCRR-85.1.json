  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 85.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The purpose of\nthis Part is to: (1)\nset forth the\ndocumentation that must be included in applications to the Comptroller for\npermission to establish, extend or increase the maximum amount to be expended\nin town or county improvement districts or to authorize or increase the maximum\namount to be expended for a town improvement; and\n(2)\nto place the primary responsibility for\ncompliance with the applicable provisions of the Town Law and the County Law\nwith local officials. It is the Comptroller's expectation that, upon receipt of\nan application which complies with this Part, he will, in all but a very\nlimited number of instances, be able to make prompt determinations of public\ninterest and undue burden, as required by statute, without requiring additional\ninformation or documents from the applicant. (b) While existing procedures used to review\napplications under the Town Law and the County Law may result in the\nidentification and correction of deficiencies, the Comptroller believes that\nthe administrative burdens and attendant delays imposed on towns and counties\nby this review may be disproportionate to the protection it provides to the\ntaxpayers. In addition, it is the Comptroller's judgment that the existing\nprocedures are no longer a wise use of the limited resources available to the\n\nComptroller's Office. Therefore, these regulations are intended to establish\nstreamlined procedures for the performance of the statutorily required approval\nfunction. (c) The procedures\ncontained in this Part are intended to eliminate the need for a detailed review\nby the Comptroller's Office of all proceedings underlying a matter requiring\nthe Comptroller's permission and, instead, place the primary responsibility for\ncompliance with the Town Law and the County Law with local officials. To this\nend, the regulations require the town or county's legal counsel to provide an\nopinion that the town or county has undertaken all necessary proceedings in the\nmanner required by statute. In addition, the town or county must submit a\nverified statement detailing the nature of the proposed improvements, the need\nfor such improvements, and the information necessary to calculate the cost of\nthe proposed improvements to the properties which will be required to pay for\nthem. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n85.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
