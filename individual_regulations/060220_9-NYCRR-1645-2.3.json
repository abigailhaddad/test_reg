  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-2.3 - Book value of investments; amortization of premium or discount\n\nState Regulations\n(a) During the\nperiod the investment is held by the local agency, the purchase price is\nperiodically adjusted by a straight-line amortization of the premium or\ndiscount on acquisition over the remaining life of the investments. The\npurchase price, as periodically adjusted, is known as the book value of the\ninvestment. The premium is defined as the excess of the purchase price over the\nface value of the securities and the discount as the excess of the face value\nover the purchase price. The amortized premium is charged through a journal\nentry to the applicable interest earned account (see §\n1645-2.4\n) and credited directly to\nthe applicable investment account; similarly, the amortized discount is charged\nto the investment account and credited to the interest earned account. For\ninvestments other than U.S. series F, G, J and series K bonds, the entry is\nmade at the end of each calendar quarter, beginning with the quarter the\ninvestment was acquired and as of the date of disposition or maturity of the\ninvestment. The entries for series F, G, J, and K bonds are made at periodic\nintervals corresponding with the table of redemption values printed on each\nbond (see §§ 1645-2.6 and\n1645-2.7\n). The effect of amortizing\nthe premium or discount, it is evident, is to have the book value equal the\nface value as of the maturity date of the investment and to put the interest\nearned on a yield basis. Straight-line amortization of premium or discount\nmeans that the premium or discount is spread evenly over the period between the\ndate of acquisition and the date of maturity. The computation is made on a\ndaily basis for short-term investments and on a monthly basis for long-term\ninvestments. Thus, in the example given in section\n1645-2.2, the $692.47 premium paid\non U.S. certificates of indebtedness (short-term investment) would be spread\nover the 360 days from June 6, 1955, the date of acquisition, to June 1, 1956, the date of maturity, and premium for 25 days would be amortized for the\nbalance of the quarter ended June 30, 1955, 92 days for the quarter ended\n\nSeptember 30, 1955, etc. As an example of the computation for a long term\ninvestment, assume that $10,000 face value of bonds, maturing July 1, 1961, were acquired for $9,700 on April 10, 1956. The $300 discount is spread evenly\nover the remaining life of the bonds (62 2/3 months) at the rate of $4.79 per\nmonth, or $14.37 per quarter. If the investment is disposed of prior to\nmaturity, the book value will reflect the premium or discount amortized to the\ndate of disposition and gain or loss on disposition will be computed\naccordingly (see §\n1645-2.5\n). The dates of disposition\nand acquisition are linked to the physical transfer of the securities between\nbuyers and sellers or their agents and will generally differ from the dates the\norders to buy or sell are given or the dates on which transfers of the cash\noccur. Statements rendered by banks or brokers handling investment transactions\nfor local agencies should be carefully examined to determine the date of\nacquisition or disposition. (b) The\nabove provisions with respect to amortization of discount shall not apply to\nthe discount on United States Treasury bills. These bills generally mature 90\ndays after date of issue and are issued at a price below par value (discount)\nand are redeemed at maturity at face value. Such discount will not be amortized\nbut will be considered as interest earned as of the date of sale or maturity. The interest earned (discount) should not be accrued but should be recorded as\nof the date of sale or maturity. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1645-2.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
