  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 680.6 - Individual program planning and review\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each individual of a specialty hospital\nshall have an individual program plan which describes for the individual their\nmedical treatment for health-related problems and active programming for\ndevelopmental disability(ies). (b) Programming and treatment shall be directed at those aspects of the\nhealth-related conditions and developmental disability necessitating the\nrestrictiveness of the specialty hospital placement. The type and duration of\nprogramming and treatment shall be structured to enable the individual's\nmovement to a less restrictive environment as quickly as possible with regard\nfor each individual's disabilities. (c) Each individual program plan shall state\nthe conditions requiring admission to a specialty hospital, the course of\ntreatment and programs prescribed for these conditions and the anticipated\noutcomes of treatment and programs. (d) The individual program plan shall be\ndeveloped and implemented by an interdisciplinary team (see section\n680.13\nof this Part) including the\nproviders of medical treatment and active programming and direct care staff. The individual and the individual's correspondent are part of the\ninterdisciplinary team unless the individual is an adult capable of objecting\nto such participation and does object. One member of this team who is a\nqualified intellectual disability professional (see section\n680.13\n) shall serve as coordinator\n(see section\n680.13\n) with primary\nresponsibility for implementation of the individual program plan, coordination\nof its components and for arranging movement of the individual to a less\nrestrictive environment as soon as the individual's needs permit. If the\nindividual has a supported decision-making agreement (see Part 634 of this\n\nTitle) that identifies a supporter or supporters to assist the individual in\nmaking decisions related to medical care, active programming, or other forms of\ntherapeutic treatment, such supporter or supporters shall be considered part of\nthe interdisciplinary team unless the individual objects to such\nparticipation. (e) Active\nprogramming is to take place in a setting separate from the individual's living\nand sleeping areas unless it is necessitated because of an individual's health\ncare problem(s) and prescribed by a physician (see section\n680.13\nunder \"Professional\n\nStaff\"). (f) The combination of\ngoal-oriented health care, medical treatment, and active programming, excluding\nrecreation, shall be at least six hours per day, five days per week in the\nmanner recommended by each individual's interdisciplinary team and as\ndocumented in the individual program plan. The medical treatment and active\nprogramming for these conditions necessitating admission to the specialty\nhospital shall be provided with the frequency and duration prescribed by the\nindividual's interdisciplinary team and documented in the individual program\nplan. Thus, a person may receive more than six hours of medical treatment and\nstructured programming per day, but can only receive less than six hours per\nday if a physician has certified in writing that such activities would be\nmedically harmful to the individual. For Willowbrook class members, approval of\nthe programming exemption must be obtained from the consumer advisory\nboard. (g) Each individual program\nplan shall specify the conditions to be treated, and the anticipated preventive\nand/or restorative outcomes resulting from the various therapeutic\ninterventions to be used. The individual program plan shall be written and\nmaintained in the manner, frequency and format prescribed by OPWDD and shall\ncontain the following components: (1)\nthe\ngoals and long- and short-term objectives established to attain or maintain the\noptimal level of health, self-care, communication, learning, mobility, recreation and capacity for independent living of which the individual is\npresently or potentially capable; (2)\nservice plans for each mandatory and\nselective service which combine into an integrated program of individually\ndesigned activities, experiences and programs necessary to achieve each\nindividual's objectives. These plans shall contain, as appropriate, specific\nindividual medical prescriptions or written direction from the\ninterdisciplinary team for all necessary services; (3)\nprogress notes describing the\nindividual's response to programs and services; (4)\nan activity schedule for each individual\nwhich includes all programs, services and leisure time activities prescribed by\nthe interdisciplinary team; and\n(5)\nidentification of the person responsible for providing each program or\nservice. (h) Review of\neach individual program plan shall be performed as follows: (1)\n\nAt least monthly a member or members of\nthe interdisciplinary team shall review the individual's response to the\nindividual program plan to determine any necessary modifications. Written\ndocumentation of such reviews shall be maintained in the individual's\nrecord. (2)\n\nAt least quarterly, the\ninterdisciplinary team shall collectively review and evaluate each person's\nindividual program plan. This review shall describe the improvement or lack of\nimprovement in those conditions for which the individual was admitted and\nadditionally include: (i) such reassessments\nof the individual's condition, assets or disabilities as may be indicated prior\nto the interdisciplinary team's review conference; (ii)\nparticipation by the individual or their\ncorrespondent, unless the individual is an adult competent to object and\nobjects to such participation; and the individual's chosen supporter or\nsupporters if the individual has a supported decision-making agreement (see\n\nPart 634 of this Title) that identifies a supporter or supporters to assist the\nindividual in making decisions related to medical care, active programming, or\nother applicable forms of therapeutic treatment; (iii)\ninput and relevant participation from\nprofessional and nonprofessional staff providing services to the\nindividual; (iv)\na review of the\nindividual's response to the active programming provided during the previous\nquarter; and\n(v) establishment of\nmodified or new long- and short-range objectives, as appropriate. (3)\n\nAt least quarterly, the\ncoordinator shall send written notification of the individual's medical\ncondition and progress in programs and services to the individual and, individual's correspondent. If the individual has a supported decision-making\nagreement (see Part 634 of this Title) that provides that a supporter is to\nreceive a copy of notice made to the individual, that supporter must also\nreceive a copy of any notice specified in this section, unless the individual\nor the supporter specifies that they do not wish for the supporter to receive\nsuch notice. (4)\n\nPrior to discharge\nor for an extended stay beyond six months and performed in accordance with\nindividual need, an interdisciplinary team, as defined in section\n680.13\nof this Part, shall conduct\na comprehensive reassessment (based upon individual assessments) of each\nindividual, covering self-care, medical, communication, learning, mobility and\ncapacity for independent living.

(c) Each individual program shall state the conditions requiring admission to a specialty hospital, the course of treatment and programs prescribed for these conditions and the anticipated outcomes of treatment and programs. (d) The individual program plan shall be developed and implemented by an interdisciplinary team (see section\n680.13\nof this Part) including the providers of medical treatment and active programming and direct care staff. One member of this team who is a qualified intellectual disability professional (see section\n680.13\n) shall serve as individual coordinator (see section\n680.13\n) with primary responsibility for implementation of the individual program plan, coordination of its components and for arranging movement of the client to a less restrictive environment as soon as the individual's needs permit.
