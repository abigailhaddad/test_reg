Tit. 9 § 446.23 - Formula for dispersion of state aid\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe amount of State aid to be allocated to counties, cities, towns or villages, pursuant to this Part, shall be determined by the\npercentage proportion which the authorized expenditure of each individual\ncounty, city, town or village, not exceeding $100,000 for each county, including municipalities therein, shall bear to the total authorized\nexpenditures of all the counties, cities, towns or villages for enforcement of\nthe Navigation Law during such enforcement year.
