(b) The superintendent will deem an insurer to have provided satisfactory evidence that it has fulfilled its obligations under article 27 of the Insurance Law within the meaning of the preceding subdivision if: (1)\nthe insurer reports: (i) that the insurer has conducted a thorough search of its files and records in compliance with section\n220.2\n(b) of this Part, in good faith and to the best of its ability; (ii)\nthat all other members of any holding company system to which the insurer belongs who are or were insurers have also conducted a search applying the same criteria and standards; and\n(iii)\nthat after all such searches have been completed, no information of the type described in section\n2705 (b)\nof the Insurance Law has been located or identified; and\n(2)\nthe insurer and, if relevant, any other members of its holding company system who are or were insurers, make and maintain a record of their said search, and such record or records are available for inspection by the superintendent if requested.

(d) Any relief from filing further reports granted by the superintendent under this section shall expire upon the happening of any event which alters the insurer's status to one in which it would be obligated by section\n2705\nof the Insurance Law to file further reports were it not for the relief previously granted, including but not limited to such events as: (1)\nthe insurer or any member of its holding company system discovering or acquiring by any manner the information described in section\n2705 (b)\nof the Insurance Law; (2)\nthe insurer or any member of its holding company system assuming liability on policies issued to, or claims made by, Holocaust victims; (3)\nthe insurer becoming a member of a holding company system which includes another member or members that have information which must be reported under the said section; and\n(4)\nthe insurer or any member of its holding company system acquiring another insurer which has such information.
