  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 38.25 - Radiation symbol, signs, labels and control devices\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Standard radiation symbol. Unless\notherwise authorized by this Part (rule) or by the commissioner, the symbol\nprescribed by this section shall use the colors magenta, purple, or black on\nyellow background. The symbol prescribed is the three-bladed design and shall\nbe as illustrated below: Image\n(1)\n\nCross-hatched area is to be magenta, purple, or black. (2)\n\nThe\nbackground is to be yellow. (3)\n\nException to color requirements for standard radiation symbol. Notwithstanding\nthe requirements of this subdivision, licensees or registrants are authorized\nto label sources, source holders, or device components containing sources of\nradiation, and which are subjected to high temperatures, with conspicuously\netched or stamped radiation caution symbols and without a color\nrequirement. (4)\n\nAdditional\ninformation on signs and labels. In addition to the contents of signs and\nlabels prescribed in this Part, the licensee or registrant shall provide, on or\nnear the required signs and labels, additional information, as appropriate, to\nmake individuals aware of potential radiation exposures and to minimize the\nexposures. (b) (1)\n\nPosting requirements. (i) Posting of radiation areas. The licensee\nor registrant shall post each radiation area with a conspicuous sign or signs\nbearing the radiation symbol and the words \"CAUTION, RADIATION AREA\". (ii)\n\nPosting of high radiation areas. The\nlicensee or registrant shall post each high radiation area with a conspicuous\nsign or signs bearing the radiation symbol and the words \" CAUTION, HIGH\nRADIATION AREA\" or \"DANGER, HIGH RADIATION AREA\". (iii)\n\nPosting of very high radiation areas. The licensee or registrant shall post each very high radiation area with a\nconspicuous sign or signs bearing the radiation symbol and words \"GRAVE DANGER, VERY HIGH RADIATION AREA\". (iv)\n\nPosting of airborne radioactivity areas. The licensee or registrant shall post\neach airborne radioactivity area with a conspicuous sign or signs bearing the\nradiation symbol and the words \"CAUTION, AIRBORNE RADIOACTIVITY AREA\" or\n\"DANGER, AIRBORNE RADIOACTIVITY AREA\". (v) Posting of areas or rooms in which\nlicensed or registered material is used or stored. The licensee or registrant\nshall post each area or room in which there is used or stored an amount of\nlicensed or registered material exceeding 10 times the quantity of such\nmaterial specified in Table 4 of section\n38.41\nof this Part (rule) with a\nconspicuous sign or signs bearing the radiation symbol and the words \"CAUTION, RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL(S)\" or \"DANGER, RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL(S)\". (2)\n\nExceptions to posting\nrequirements. (i) A licensee or registrant is\nnot required to post caution signs in areas or rooms containing sources of\nradiation for periods of less than eight hours, if each of the following\nconditions is met: (a) the sources of\nradiation are constantly attended during these periods by an individual who\ntakes the precautions necessary to prevent the exposure of individuals to\nsources of radiation in excess of the limits established in this Part (rule); and\n(b) the area or room is subject\nto the licensee's or registrant's control. (ii)\nA room or area is not required to be\nposted with a caution sign because of the presence of a sealed source provided\nthe radiation level at 30 centimeters from the surface of the sealed source\ncontainer or housing does not exceed 0.05 mSv (0.005 rem) per hour. (c) Labeling containers\nand radiation machines. (1)\n\nThe licensee or\nregistrant shall ensure that each container of licensed or registered material\nbears a durable, clearly visible label bearing the radiation symbol and the\nwords \"CAUTION, RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL\"or \"DANGER, RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL\". The\nlabel shall also provide information, such as the radionuclides present, an\nestimate of the quantity of radioactivity, the date for which the activity is\nestimated, radiation levels, kinds of materials, and mass enrichment, sufficient to permit individuals handling or using containers, or working in\nthe vicinity of the containers, to take precautions to avoid or minimize\nexposures. (2)\n\nEach licensee shall, prior to removal or disposal of empty uncontaminated containers to unrestricted\nareas, remove or deface the radioactive material label or otherwise clearly\nindicate that the container no longer contains radioactive materials. (3)\n\nEach registrant shall ensure that each\nradiation machine is labeled in a conspicuous manner which cautions individuals\nthat radiation is produced when it is energized. (4)\n\nExceptions to labeling requirements. A\nlicensee or registrant is not required to label: (i) containers holding licensed material in\nquantities less than the quantities listed in Table 4 of section\n38.41\nof this Part\n(rule); (ii)\ncontainers holding\nlicensed material in concentrations less than those specified in Appendix A-13, Table III of section\n38.41\nof this Part\n(rule); (iii)\nfor laboratory\ncontainers, such as beakers, flasks, and test tubes, used transiently in\nlaboratory procedures (i.e. for a period of a few hours) in the presence of an\nauthorized user; (iv)\ncontainers\nholding licensed material when they are in transport and packaged and labeled\nin accordance with the regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation for\nradioactive material; (v) containers that are accessible only to individuals authorized to handle or use\nthem, or to work in the vicinity of the containers, if the contents are\nidentified to these individuals by a readily available written record. Examples\nof containers of this type are containers in locations such as water-filled\ncanals, storage vaults, or hotcells. The record shall be retained as long as\nthe containers are in use for the purpose indicated on the record; or\n(vi)\ninstalled manufacturing or process\nequipment, such as chemical process equipment, piping, and tanks. (d) Control of access\nto high radiation areas. (1)\n\nThe licensee or\nregistrant shall ensure that each entrance or access point to a high radiation\narea has one or more of the following features: (i) a control device that, upon entry into\nthe area, causes the level of radiation to be reduced below that level at which\nan individual might receive a deep dose equivalent of 1 mSv (0.1 rem) in one\nhour at 30 centimeters from the source of radiation or from any surface that\nthe radiation penetrates; (ii)\na\ncontrol device that energizes a conspicuous visible or audible alarm signal so\nthat the individual entering the high radiation area, and the supervisor of the\nactivity, are made aware of the entry; or\n(iii)\nentryways that are locked, except\nduring periods when access to the areas is required, with positive control over\neach individual entry. (2)\n\nIn place of the controls required by\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, the licensee or registrant may substitute\ncontinuous direct or electronic surveillance that is capable of preventing\nunauthorized entry. (3)\n\nThe\nlicensee or registrant may use alternative methods for controlling access to\nhigh radiation areas if they are approved by the commissioner as effective at\naccomplishing such control. (4)\n\nThe\nlicensee or registrant shall establish the controls required by paragraphs (1)\nand (3) of this subdivision in a way that does not prevent individuals from\nleaving a high radiation area. (5)\n\nThe licensee or registrant is not required to control each entrance or access\npoint to a room or other area that is a high radiation area solely because of\nthe presence of radioactive materials prepared for transport and packaged and\nlabeled in accordance with the regulations of the U.S. Department of\n\nTransportation for radioactive material, provided that: (i) the packages do not remain in the area\nlonger than three days; and\n(ii)\nthe dose rate at one meter from the external surface of any package does not\nexceed 0.1 mSv (0.01 rem) per hour. (e) Control of access to very high radiation\nareas. In addition to the requirements in subdivision (d) of this section, the\nlicensee or registrant shall institute additional measures to ensure that an\nindividual is not able to gain unauthorized or inadvertent access to areas in\nwhich radiation levels could be encountered at 5 Gy (500 rad) or more in one\nhour at one meter from a source of radiation or any surface through which the\nradiation penetrates. This requirement does not apply to radiation sources\nsubject to subdivision (f) of this section. (f) Control of access to very high radiation\nareas--irradiators. (1)\n\nThis subdivision\napplies to licensees or registrants with sources of radiation in\nnon-self-shielded irradiators. This subdivision does not apply to sources of\nradiation that are used in industrial radiography, or in completely\nself-shielded irradiators in which the source of radiation is both stored and\noperated within the same shielding radiation barrier and, in the designed\nconfiguration of the irradiator, is always physically inaccessible to any\nindividual and cannot create a radiation level of 5 Gy (500 rad) or more in one\nhour at one meter in an area that is accessible to any individual. (2)\n\nEach area in which there may exist\nradiation levels in excess of 5 Gy (500 rad) in one hour at one meter from a\nsource of radiation that is used to irradiate materials shall meet the\nfollowing requirements: (i) Each entrance or\naccess point shall be equipped with entry control devices which: (a) function automatically to prevent any\nindividual from inadvertently entering a very high radiation area; (b) permit deliberate entry into the area\nonly after a control device is actuated that causes the radiation level within\nthe area, from the source of radiation, to be reduced below that at which it\nwould be possible for an individual to receive a deep dose equivalent in excess\nof 1 mSv (0.1 rem) in one hour; and\n(c) when actuated, prevent operation of the\nsource of radiation if it would produce radiation levels in the area that could\nresult in a deep dose equivalent to an individual in excess of 1 mSv (0.1 rem)\nin one hour. (ii)\n\nAdditional control devices shall be provided so that, upon failure of the entry\ncontrol devices to function as required by subparagraph (i) of this paragraph: (a) the radiation level within the area, from\nthe source of radiation, is reduced below that at which it would be possible\nfor an individual to receive a deep dose equivalent in excess of 1 mSv (0.1\nrem) in one hour; and\n(b) conspicuous visible and audible alarm signals are generated to make an\nindividual attempting to enter the area aware of the hazard as well as at least\none other authorized individual, who is physically present, familiar with the\nactivity and prepared to render or summon assistance, aware of the failure of\nthe entry control devices. (iii)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall\nprovide control devices so that, upon failure or removal of physical radiation\nbarriers other than the sealed source's shielded storage container: (a) the radiation level from the source of\nradiation is reduced below that at which it would be possible for an individual\nto receive a deep dose equivalent in excess of 1 mSv (0.1 rem) in one hour; and\n(b) conspicuous visible and\naudible alarm signals are generated to make potentially affected individuals\naware of the hazard; as well as to make the licensee or registrant or at least\none other individual, who is familiar with the activity and prepared to render\nor summon assistance, aware of the failure or removal of the physical\nbarrier. (iv)\n\nWhen the\nshield for stored sealed sources is a liquid, the licensee or registrant shall\nprovide means to monitor the integrity of the shield and to signal, automatically, loss of shielding to a level at which it would be possible for\nan individual to receive a deep dose equivalent in excess of 1 mSv (0.1 rem) in\none hour. (v) Physical radiation\nbarriers that comprise permanent structural components, such as walls, that\nhave no credible probability of failure or removal in ordinary circumstances\nneed not meet the requirements of subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) of this\nparagraph. (vi)\n\nEach area shall be\nequipped with devices that will automatically generate conspicuous visible and\naudible alarm signals to alert personnel in the area before the source of\nradiation can be put into operation, and in time for any individual in the area\nto operate a clearly identified control device which must be installed in the\narea, and which will prevent the source of radiation from being put into\noperation. (vii)\n\nEach area shall be\ncontrolled by use of such procedures and devices as are necessary to ensure\nthat the area is cleared of personnel prior to each use of the source of\nradiation. (viii)\n\nPrior to the\nfirst individual's entry into each very high radiation area after any use of\nthe source of radiation, the area shall be checked by a radiation measurement. The area may not be used unless the radiation level from the source of\nradiation in the area is below that at which it would be possible for an\nindividual to receive a deep dose equivalent in excess of 1 mSv (0.1 rem) in\none hour. (ix)\n\nThe entry control\ndevices required in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall have been tested\nfor proper functioning as follows: (a) testing shall be conducted prior to initial operation with the source of\nradiation on any day, unless operations were continued uninterrupted from the\nprevious day; (b) testing shall be\nconducted prior to resumption of operation of the source of radiation after any\nunintentional interruption; and\n(c) the licensee or registrant shall submit and adhere to a schedule for periodic\ntests of the entry control and warning systems. (x) The licensee or registrant shall not\nconduct operations, other than those necessary to place the source of radiation\nin safe condition or to effect repairs on controls, unless control devices are\nfunctioning properly. (xi)\n\nEntry\nand exit portals that are used in transporting materials to and from the\nirradiation area, and that are not intended for use by individuals, shall be\ncontrolled by such procedures and devices as are necessary to physically\nprotect and warn against inadvertent entry by any individual through these\nportals. Exit portals for irradiated materials shall be equipped to detect and\nsignal the presence of any loose radioactive material that is carried toward\nsuch an exit and to automatically prevent loose radioactive material from being\ncarried out of the area. (3)\n\nLicensees, registrants, or applicants for\nlicenses or registrations for sources of radiation within the purview of this\nsubdivision which will be used in a variety of positions or in locations, such\nas open fields or forests, that make it impracticable to comply with certain\nrequirements of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, such as those for the\nautomatic control of radiation levels, may apply to the commissioner for\napproval of alternative safety measures. Alternative safety measures shall\nprovide personnel protection at least equivalent to those specified in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. At least one of the alternative measures\nshall include an entry-preventing interlock control based on a measurement of\nthe radiation present that ensures the absence of high radiation levels before\nan individual can gain access to the area where such sources of radiation are\nused. (4)\n\nThe entry control devices\nrequired by paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision shall be established in\nsuch a way that no individual will be prevented from leaving the\narea. Notes\nN.Y.
