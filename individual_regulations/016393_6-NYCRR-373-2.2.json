  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.2 - General facility standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nThe\nregulations in this section apply to owners and operators of all hazardous\nwaste facilities, except as provided in section\n373-2.1\nof this Subpart and in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nParagraph (j)(1) of this section applies\nonly to facilities subject to regulations under sections 373-2.9 through\n373-2.15\nand\n373-2.24\nof this Subpart. (b) Facility ownership\ntransfer. (1)\n\nThe ownership or\noperation of a facility during its operating life, or a disposal facility\nduring the period of post-closure care, shall be transferable only upon prior\nwritten approval of the department. (2)\n\nBefore transferring ownership or\noperation of a facility during its operating life, or of a disposal facility\nduring the post-closure care period, the owner or operator must notify the new\nowner or operator, in writing, of the requirements of this Subpart and Subpart\n373-1 of this Part. (c) Identification number. Every facility owner or operator must apply to EPA for an\nEPA identification number in accordance with the EPA notification procedures\n(45 FR\n12746\net seq. ) (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). (d) Required\nnotices. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of\na facility that has arranged to receive hazardous waste from a source outside\nof the United States must notify the department in writing at least four weeks\nin advance of the date on which the first shipment of the hazardous waste is\nexpected to arrive at the facility. The owner or operator of a facility that\nhas arranged to receive hazardous waste from an OECD country, as defined in\nsection\n372.5\n(h)(1)\nof\nthis Title must also notify the EPA regional administrator in writing at least\nfour weeks in advance of the date on which the first shipment of the hazardous\nwaste is expected to arrive at the facility. Notice of subsequent shipments of\nthe same waste from the same foreign source is not required. Note: For purposes of reference only: The owner or operator of\na recovery facility that has arranged to receive hazardous waste from an OECD\nmember country, as defined in section\n372.5\n(h)(1)\nof\nthis Title, must also meet the requirement of\n40 CFR\n264.12(a)(2)\n(see section\n370.1(e) of this Title). (2)\n\nThe owner or operator of a facility that receives hazardous waste from an\noffsite source (except where the owner or operator is also the generator) must\ninform the generator in writing that he or she has the appropriate permit(s)\nfor, and will accept, the waste the generator is shipping. The owner or\noperator must keep a copy of this written notice as part of the operating\nrecord. (e) General waste analysis. (1)\n(i) Before an owner or operator treats, stores or disposes of any hazardous wastes, or nonhazardous wastes if\napplicable under section\n373-2.7\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart, a detailed chemical and physical analysis of a representative\nsample of the wastes must be obtained. At a minimum, this analysis must contain\nall the information which must be known to treat, store or dispose of the waste\nin accordance with the requirements of this Subpart and Part 376 of this\n\nTitle. (ii)\n\nThe analysis may\ninclude data developed under Part 371 of this Title, and existing published or\ndocumented data on the hazardous waste or on hazardous waste generated from\nsimilar processes. Note: For example, the facility's records of analyses performed\non the waste before the effective date of these regulations, or studies\nconducted on hazardous waste generated from processes similar to that which\ngenerated the waste to be managed at the facility, may be included in the data\nbase required to comply with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. The owner or\noperator of an offsite facility may arrange for the generator of the hazardous\nwaste to supply part of the information required by subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, except as otherwise specified in section\n376.1\n(g)(2) and\n(3)\nof this Title. If the generator does not\nsupply the information, and the owner or operator chooses to accept a hazardous\nwaste, the owner or operator is responsible for obtaining the information\nrequired to comply with this section. (iii)\n\nThe analysis must be repeated as\nnecessary to ensure that it is accurate and up-to- date. At a minimum, the\nanalysis must be repeated: (a) when the owner\nor operator is notified, or has reason to believe, that the process or\noperation generating the hazardous wastes, or nonhazardous waste if applicable\nunder section\n373-2.7\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart, has changed; and\n(b) for off-site facilities, when the results of the inspection required in\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph indicate that the hazardous waste received\nat the facility does not match the waste designated on the accompanying\nmanifest or shipping paper. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator of an off-site\nfacility must inspect and, if necessary, analyze each hazardous waste movement\nreceived at the facility to determine whether it matches the identity of the\nwaste specified on the accompanying manifest or shipping paper. (2)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must develop and follow a written waste analysis plan which describes\nthe procedures which will be carried out to comply with paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. This plan must be kept at the facility. At a minimum, the plan\nmust specify: (i) the parameters for which\neach hazardous waste, or nonhazardous waste if applicable under section\n373-2.7\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart, will be analyzed and the rationale for the selection of these\nparameters (\ni.e., how analysis for these parameters will\nprovide sufficient information on the waste's properties to comply with\nparagraph [1] of this subdivision); (ii)\nthe test methods which will be used to\ntest for these parameters; (iii)\nthe sampling method which will be used to obtain a representative sample of the\nwaste to be analyzed. A representative sample may be obtained using either: (a) one of the sampling methods described in\n\nAppendix 19 of this Title; or\n(b) an equivalent sampling method; (iv)\nthe frequency with which the initial\nanalysis of the waste will be reviewed or repeated to ensure that the analysis\nis accurate and up-to-date; (v) for\noff-site facilities, the waste analyses that hazardous waste generators have\nagreed to supply; (vi)\nwhere\napplicable, the methods that will be used to meet the additional waste analysis\nrequirements for specific waste management methods as specified in sections\n373-2.2\n(i), 373-2.14\n(j), 373-2.15\n(b), 373-2.27\n(e)(4), 373-2.28\n(n)(4)\nand\n373-2.29\n(d) of\nthis Subpart and section\n376.1\n(g) of this\n\nTitle; and\n(vii)\nfor surface\nimpoundments exempted from land disposal restrictions under section\n376.1\n(d)(1)\nof\nthis Title, the procedures and schedules for: (a) the sampling of impoundment\ncontents; (b) the analysis of test\ndata; and\n(c) the annual removal of\nresidues which are not delisted under section\n370.3\n(c) of this\n\nTitle and do exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste, and which do not meet\nthe treatment standards of section\n376.4\nof this Title; (viii)\nfor owners and operators\nseeking an exemption to the air emission standards of section\n373-2.29\nof this Subpart in\naccordance with section\n373-2.29\n(c) of\nthis Subpart: (a) If direct measurement is\nused for the waste determination, the procedures and schedules for waste\nsampling and analysis, and the results of the analysis of the test data to\nverify the exemption. (b) If\nknowledge of the waste is used for the waste determination, any information\nprepared by the facility owner or operator or by the generator of the hazardous\nwaste, if the waste is received from off-site, that is used as the basis for\nknowledge of the waste. (3)\n\nFor off-site facilities, the waste\nanalysis plan required in paragraph (2) of this subdivision must also specify\nthe procedures which will be used to inspect and, if necessary, analyze each\nmovement of hazardous waste received at the facility to ensure that it matches\nthe identity of the waste designated on the accompanying manifest or shipping\npaper. At a minimum, the plan must describe: (i) the procedures which will be used to\ndetermine the identity of each movement of waste managed at the\nfacility; (ii)\nthe sampling method\nwhich will be used to obtain a representative sample of the waste to be\nidentified, if the identification method includes sampling; and\n(iii)\nthe procedures that the owner or\noperator of an off-site landfill receiving containerized hazardous waste will\nuse to determine whether a hazardous waste generator or treater has added a\nbiodegradable sorbent to the waste in the container. (f) Security. (1)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must prevent the unknowing entry, and minimize the possibility for the\nunauthorized entry, of persons or livestock onto the active portion of the\nfacility, unless the owner or operator can demonstrate to the commissioner\nthat: (i) physical contact with the waste, structures or equipment within the active portion of the facility will not\ninjure unknowing or unauthorized persons or livestock which may enter the\nactive portion of a facility; and\n(ii)\ndisturbance of the waste or equipment, by the unknowing or unauthorized entry of persons or livestock onto the active\nportion of a facility, will not cause a violation of the requirements of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nUnless the\nowner or operator has made a successful demonstration under subparagraphs\n(1)(i) and (ii) of this subdivision, a facility must have: (i) a 24-hour surveillance system\n(\ne.g., television monitoring or surveillance by guards or\nfacility personnel) which continuously monitors and controls entry onto the\nactive portion of the facility; or\n(ii)\n(a) an\nartificial or natural barrier (\ne.g., a fence in good repair or\na fence combined with a cliff), which completely surrounds the active portion\nof the facility; and\n(b) a means to\ncontrol entry, at all times, through the gates or other entrances to the active\nportion of the facility (\ne.g., an attendant, television\nmonitors, locked entrance, or controlled roadway access to the\nfacility). (3)\n\nUnless the owner or operator has made a\nsuccessful demonstration under subparagraphs (1)(i) and (ii) of this\nsubdivision, a sign with the legend, \"Danger-Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out,\"\nmust be posted at each entrance of the active portion of a facility, and at\nother locations, in sufficient numbers to be seen from any approach to this\nactive portion. The legend must be written in English, and written in French in\ncounties bordering the Canadian Province of Quebec. The legend must be legible\nfrom a distance of at least 25 feet. Existing signs with a legend other than\n\"Danger-Unauthorized Personnel Keep Out\" may be used if the legend on the sign\nindicates that only authorized personnel are allowed to enter the active\nportion, and that entry onto the active portion can be dangerous. (g) General inspection\nrequirements. (1)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must inspect the facility for malfunctions and deterioration, operator\nerrors, and discharges which may be causing or may lead to: (i) release of hazardous waste constituents\nto the environment; or\n(ii)\na\nthreat to human health. The owner or operator must conduct these inspections\noften enough to identify problems in time to correct them before they harm\nhuman health or the environment. (2)\n(i) The\nowner or operator must develop and follow a written schedule for inspecting\nmonitoring equipment, safety and emergency equipment, security devices, and\noperating and structural equipment (such as dikes and sump pumps) that are\nimportant to preventing, detecting or responding to environmental or human\nhealth hazards. (ii)\n\nThis schedule\nmust be kept at the facility. (iii)\n\nThe schedule must identify the types of problems (\ne.g., malfunctions or deterioration) which are to be looked for during the inspection\n(\ne.g., inoperative sump pump, leaking fitting, eroding dike, etc.). (iv)\n\nThe frequency of\ninspection may vary for the items on the schedule. However, the frequency\nshould be based on the rate of deterioration of the equipment and the\nprobability of an environmental or human health incident if the deterioration, malfunction, or any operator error goes undetected between inspections. Areas\nsubject to spills, such as loading and unloading areas, must be inspected daily\nwhen in use. At a minimum, the inspection schedule must include the items and\nfrequencies called for in sections\n373-2.9\n(e), 373-2.10\n(d) and\n(f), 373-2.11\n(d), 373-2.12\n(e), 373-2.13\n(f), 373-2.14\n(e), 373-2.15\n(g), 373-2.24\n(c), 373-2.27\n(d), 373-2.28\n(c), (d) and\n(i) and\n373-2.29\n(d)-(j)\nof\nthis Subpart, where applicable. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator must remedy any\ndeterioration or malfunction of equipment or structures which the inspection\nreveals on a schedule which ensures that the problem does not lead to an\nenvironmental or human health hazard. Where a hazard is imminent or has already\noccurred, remedial action must be taken immediately. (4)\n\nThe owner or operator must record\ninspections in an inspection log or summary. These records must be kept for at\nleast three years from the date of inspection. At a minimum, these records must\ninclude the date and time of the inspection, the name of the inspector, a\nnotation of the observations made, and the date and nature of any repairs or\nother remedial actions. (h) Personnel training. (1)\n(i) Facility personnel must successfully complete a program of classroom\ninstruction or on-the-job training that teaches them to perform their duties in\na way that ensures the facility's compliance with the requirements of this\n\nPart. The owner or operator must ensure that this program includes all the\nelements described in the document required under subparagraph (4)(iii) of this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nThis program must\nbe directed by a person trained in hazardous waste management procedures, and\nmust include instruction which teaches facility personnel hazardous waste\nmanagement procedures (including contingency plan implementation) relevant to\nthe positions in which they are employed. (iii)\n\nAt a minimum, the training program must\nbe designed to ensure that facility personnel are able to respond effectively\nto emergencies by familiarizing them with emergency procedures, emergency\nequipment and emergency systems, including, where applicable: (a) procedures for using, inspecting, repairing and replacing facility emergency and monitoring equipment; (b) key parameters for automatic waste feed\ncutoff systems; (c) communication\nor alarm systems; (d) response to\nfires or explosions; (e) response\nto ground-water contamination incidents; and\n(f) shutdown of operations. (iv)\n\nFor facility employees who\nreceive emergency response training pursuant to Occupational Safety and Health\n\nAdministration (OSHA) regulations\n29 CFR\n1910.120(p)(8)\nand\n1910.120(q)\n(see section 370.1(e) of this Title), the facility is not required to provide\nseparate emergency response training pursuant to this section, provided that\nthe overall facility training meets all the requirements of this\nsection. (2)\n\nFacility\npersonnel must successfully complete the program required in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision within six months after the date of their employment or an\nassignment to a facility, whichever is later. Employees must not work in\nunsupervised positions until they have completed the training requirements of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nFacility personnel must take part in an\nannual review of the initial training required in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (4)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must maintain the following documents and records at the facility: (i) the job title for each position at the\nfacility related to hazardous waste management, and the name of the employee\nfilling each job; (ii)\na written\njob description for each position listed under subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. This description may be consistent in its degree of specificity with\ndescriptions for other similar positions in the same company location or\nbargaining unit, but must include the requisite skill, education or other\nqualifications, and duties of employees assigned to each position; (iii)\na written description of the type and\namount of both introductory and continuing training that will be given to each\nperson filling a position listed under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph; and\n(iv)\nrecords that document that\nthe training or job experience required under paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of\nthis subdivision has been given to, and completed by, facility\npersonnel. (5)\n\nTraining\nrecords on current personnel must be kept until closure of the facility; training records on former employees must be kept for at least three years from\nthe date the employee last worked at the facility. Personnel training records\nmay accompany personnel transferred within the same company. Note: Owners and operators are required to submit, with the\npermit application, an outline of the training program used (or to be used) at\nthe facility and a brief description of how the training program is designed to\nmeet actual job tasks. (i) General requirements for ignitable, reactive or incompatible wastes. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator must take precautions to prevent accidental ignition or\nreaction of ignitable or reactive waste. This waste must be separated and\nprotected from sources of ignition or reaction, including but not limited to: open flames, smoking, cutting and welding, hot surfaces, frictional heat, sparks (static, electrical or mechanical), spontaneous ignition\n(\ne.g., from heat-producing chemical reactions), and radiant\nheat. While ignitable or reactive waste is being handled, the owner or operator\nmust confine smoking and open flame to specially designated locations. \"No\n\nSmoking\" signs must be conspicuously placed wherever there is a hazard from\nignitable or reactive waste. (2)\n\nWhere specifically required by other sections of this Part, the owner or\noperator of a facility that treats, stores or disposes of ignitable or reactive\nwaste, or mixes incompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and other\nmaterials, must take precautions to prevent reactions which: (i) generate extreme heat or pressure, fire\nor explosions, or violent reactions; (ii)\nproduce uncontrolled toxic mists, fumes, dusts or gases in sufficient quantities to threaten human health or the\nenvironment; (iii)\nproduce\nuncontrolled flammable fumes or gases in sufficient quantities to pose a risk\nof fire or explosion; (iv)\ndamage\nthe structural integrity of the device or facility; or\n(v) through other like means threaten human\nhealth or the environment. (3)\n\nWhen required to comply with paragraph\n(1) or (2) of this subdivision, the owner or operator must document that\ncompliance. This documentation may be based on references to published\nscientific or engineering literature, data from trial tests\n(\ne.g., bench scale or pilot scale tests), waste analyses (as\nspecified in subdivision [e] of this section), or the results of the treatment\nof similar wastes by similar treatment processes and under similar operating\nconditions. (j) Location standards. (1)\n(i) Flood plains. A facility located in a\n100-year flood plain must be designed, constructed, operated and maintained to\nprevent washout of any hazardous waste by a 100-year flood, unless the owner or\noperator can demonstrate to the commissioner's satisfaction that: (a) procedures are in effect which will cause\nthe waste to be removed safely, before floodwaters can reach the facility, to a\nlocation where the wastes will not be vulnerable to floodwaters; or\n(b) for existing surface impoundments, waste\npiles, land treatment units, landfills, and miscellaneous units no adverse\neffects on human health or the environment will result if washout occurs, considering: (1)\nthe volume and physical and\nchemical characteristics of the waste in the facility; (2)\nthe concentration of hazardous\nconstituents that would potentially affect surface waters as a result of\nwashout; (3)\nthe impact of such\nconcentrations on the current or potential uses of, and water quality standards\nestablished for, the affected surface waters; and\n(4)\nthe impact of hazardous constituents on\nthe sediments of affected surface waters or the soils of the 100-year flood\nplain that could result from washout. Comment: The location where wastes are moved must be a facility\nwhich is either permitted by EPA under 40 CFR part\n270, authorized to manage\nhazardous waste by the State under 6 NYCRR Part\n373, authorized to manage\nhazardous waste by another state with a hazardous waste management program\nauthorized under 40 CFR part\n271, or in interim status under 40 CFR parts\n270\nand\n265\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). (ii)\n\nAs used in subparagraph (1)(i) of this\nsubdivision: (a) 100-year flood\nplain\nmeans any land area which is subject to a one-percent or greater\nchance of flooding in any given year from any source. (b) Washout\nmeans the\nmovement of hazardous waste from the active portion of the facility as a result\nof flooding. (c) 100-year\nflood\nmeans a flood that has a one-percent chance of being equaled or\nexceeded in any given year. (2)\n\nSalt dome formations, salt bed\nformations, underground mines and caves. The placement of any noncontainerized\nor bulk liquid hazardous waste in any salt dome formation, salt bed formation, underground mine or cave is prohibited. (k) Construction quality assurance\nprogram. (1)\nCQA program. (i) A construction quality assurance (CQA)\nprogram is required for all surface impoundment, waste pile, and landfill units\nthat are required to comply with sections\n373-2.11\n(b)(3) and\n(4), and\n373-2.14\n(c)(3) and\n(4)\nof this Subpart. The program must ensure\nthat the constructed unit meets or exceeds all design criteria and\nspecifications in the permit. The program must be developed and implemented\nunder the direction of a CQA officer who is a professional engineer registered\nin New York State. (ii)\n\nThe CQA\nprogram must address the following physical components, where applicable: (a) foundations; (b) dikes; (c) low-permeability soil liners; (d) geomembranes (flexible membrane\nliners); (e) leachate collection\nand removal systems and leak detection systems; and\n(f) final cover systems. (2)\n\nWritten CQA plan. The owner or\noperator of units subject to the CQA program under paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision must develop and implement a written CQA plan. The plan must\nidentify steps that will be used to monitor and document the quality of\nmaterials and the condition and manner of their installation. The CQA plan must\ninclude: (i) identification of applicable\nunits, and a description of how they will be constructed; (ii)\nidentification of key personnel in the\ndevelopment and implementation of the CQA plan, and CQA officer qualifications; and\n(iii)\na description of\ninspection and sampling activities for all unit components identified in\nsubparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision, including observations and tests that\nwill be used before, during, and after construction to ensure that the\nconstruction materials and the installed unit components meet the design\nspecifications. The description must cover: sampling size and locations; frequency of testing; data evaluation procedures; acceptance and rejection\ncriteria for construction materials; plans for implementing corrective\nmeasures; and data or other information to be recorded and retained in the\noperating record under section\n373-2.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart. (3)\n\nContents of\nprogram. (i) The CQA program must include\nobservations, inspections, tests, and measurements sufficient to ensure: (a) structural stability and integrity of all\ncomponents of the unit identified in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this\nsubdivision; (b) proper\nconstruction of all components of the liners, leachate collection and removal\nsystem, leak detection system, and final cover system, according to permit\nspecifications and good engineering practices, and proper installation of all\ncomponents (\ne.g., pipes) according to design specifications; and\n(c) conformity of all materials\nused with design and other material specifications under sections\n373-2.11\n(b), 373-2.12\n(b), and\n373-2.14\n(c) of\nthis Subpart. (ii)\n\nThe\nCQA program shall include test fills for compacted soil liners, using the same\ncompaction methods as in the full scale unit, to ensure that the liners are\nconstructed to meet the hydraulic conductivity requirements of sections\n373-2.11\n(b)(3)(i)\n(\na\n)(\n2\n), 373-2.12(b)(3)(i)(\na\n)(\n2\n), and\n373-2.14(c)(3)(i)(\na\n)(\n2\n) of this Subpart in\nthe field. Compliance with the hydraulic conductivity requirements must be\nverified by using in situ testing on the constructed test fill. The\ncommissioner may accept an alternative demonstration, in lieu of a test fill, where data are sufficient to show that a constructed soil liner will meet the\nhydraulic conductivity requirements of sections\n373-2.11\n(b)(3)(i)\n(\na\n)(\n2\n), 372-2.12(b)(3)(i)(\na\n)(\n2\n), and\n373-2.14(c)(3)(i)(\na\n)(\n2\n) of this Subpart in\nthe field. (4)\n\nCertification. Waste shall not be received in a unit subject to this\nsubdivision until the owner or operator has submitted to the commissioner by\ncertified mail or hand delivery a certification signed by the CQA officer that\nthe approved CQA plan has been successfully carried out and that the unit meets\nthe requirements of sections\n373-2.11\n(b)(3) or\n(4), 373-2.12\n(b)(3) or\n(4), or\n373-2.14\n(c)(3) or\n(4)\nof this Subpart; and the procedure in\nsection\n373-1.6\n(a)(12)(ii)\n(\nb\n) of this Part has been completed.
