  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.49 - Mystery awards\n\nState Regulations\n\nIt is acceptable for a game to offer a mystery award, which is an award that is not tied to any specific symbol combination, if such\ngame indicates the maximum amount the player potentially could win. If the\nminimum amount that potentially could be won is not displayed, such amount will\nbe assumed to be zero. In addition, both a minimum and maximum amount shall be\ndisplayed for any mystery award if the method to receive such award involves\nstrategy or skill, including methods whereby the value of the pay table is used\nin order to make decisions that could increase the return to the player (e.g., video poker).
