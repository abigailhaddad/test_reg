(ii)\nA court order of support does not exist\nor has been vacated by the court.

(2)\n\nThe written notice to the respondent, or\nbilling statement attached thereto, must include the following statements: (i) The SCU records indicate that you are\noverdue in making scheduled support payments and/or have an unpaid balance on\ncourt-ordered support arrears.

(ix)\n\nThe decision of\nthe SCU will be based solely upon consideration of the SCU records, any written\ndocumentation submitted by you and any written or oral evidence presented at\nthe conference which you requested. The written decision of the SCU will be the\nfinal administrative determination. (x) Upon the making of a final determination\nthat your lottery prize should not be credited against past-due support, wholly\nor in part, the SCU will repay you for amounts which were improperly\ncredited. (xi)\n\nYou may seek\njudicial review of the final determination pursuant to article 78 of the Civil\n\nPractice Law and Rules within the time limits provided by law.
