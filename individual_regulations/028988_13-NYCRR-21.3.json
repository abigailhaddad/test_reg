This section, if applicable, must be on a separate page, immediately\nfollowing the table of contents. All features of a plan which involve significant risk or will disproportionately or unusually affect maintenance\ncharges or obligations of shareholders in future years of cooperative operation must be conspicuously disclosed and highlighted. A brief description\nof the risk should be given in this section and a more thorough description should be given in a referenced later section. Questions as to whether a\nrisk should be highlighted in this section should be resolved in favor of inclusion. (1)\n\nDisclose whether\nsponsor is reserving the right to rent rather than sell units appurtenant to its unsold shares (hereinafter \"units\") and whether there are any limits\nplaced on sponsor's right rent rather than sell under the terms of the construction loan for the project or whether sponsor is limiting its right to\nrent rather than sell based on objective articulable criteria, such as a significant decline in market prices of a specific percentage and the\nconditions upon which the sponsor would resume sales. If sponsor is reserving an unconditional right to rent without committing itself to sell at\nleast 51 percent of the units, the cover of the plan must state in bold print: BECAUSE SPONSOR IS RETAINING THE RIGHT TO RENT MORE THAN 49 PERCENT\nOF THE UNITS IN THE BUILDING OR BUILDINGS BEING CONSTRUCTED FOR COOPERATIVE OWNERSHIP, FUTURE MARKETABILITY OF THE UNITS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED\nAND PURCHASERS MAY NEVER GAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE COOP BOARD. (SEE SPECIAL RISKS SECTION.)\n\nDisclose that as a result of sponsor retaining more than 49 percent of\nthe units, marketability of the units may be adversely affected. Explain that certain institutional lenders may be unwilling to make loans for the\npurchase of units in a cooperative in which the sponsor and/or holders of unsold shares retain more than 49 percent of the units and that purchasers\nmay therefore for unable to obtain institutional financing for their own purchase. Disclose that if they do close title and subsequently seek to sell\ntheir apartments, prospective purchasers may be unable to obtain institutional financing solely on the basis of sponsor's holding more than 49\npercent of the units in the cooperative corporation, regardless of the credit worthiness of the prospective purchaser. If the sponsor is able to\ndemonstrate that an institutional lender has approved the project for coop loans to qualified purchasers, a disclosure identifying the lender, the\nterms of the loans to be offered, eligibility criteria and other material aspects of the lender's commitment to the project should be\nincluded. (2)\n\nIf sponsor represents that it will set 51 percent of the units, to purchasers for\npersonal occupancy, disclose whether sponsor further represents that it will endeavor in good faith to sell, in a reasonably timely manner, all\nremaining unsold units to purchasers for personal occupancy, in the building or building being converted to cooperative ownership. If sponsor intends\nto sell fewer than all of the units, disclose this fact and the number and percentage which sponsor does intend to sell, in bold print as the first\nspecial risk. Disclose that the units reserved by sponsor may remain unsold indefinitely and sponsor may dispose of such units as it chooses, including selling to investors, renting to tenants, permitting occupancy by relatives or others, allowing them to remain vacant or selling to\npurchasers for personal occupancy. If the sponsor later chooses to sell a greater number and percentage of units to the public for personal occupancy\nthan disclosed in the initial offering plan, the plan must be amended to disclose that fact. If sponsor makes a bulk sale of all or some of its unsold shares, the\ntransferee is bound by sponsor's representations regarding its commitment to sell units. (3)\n\nIf\nthe bylaws of the cooperative do not include a provision that after the initial sponsor voting control period, a majority of the Board of Directors\nmust be owner-occupants or members of owner-occupants' households, who are unrelated to the sponsor and its principals, this fact must be disclosed\nas a special risk and the following warning must be placed on the cover: THIS PLAN DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT OWNER-OCCUPANTS WILL EVER\nCONSTITUTE A MAJORITY OF THE COOP BOARD OF DIRECTORS. (SEE SPECIAL RISKS SECTION OF PLAN.)\n\nDisclose that unless and until a majority of the Board are residents of\nthe building unrelated to the sponsor, owner-occupants will not gain effective control and management of the cooperative. Disclose that\nowner-occupants and non-resident shareholders, including sponsor, may have inherent conflicts on how the cooperative should be managed because of\ntheir different reasons for purchasing, i.e. purchase as a home as opposed to as an investment. (d) Definitions. Important terms, terms that are not likely to be understood by the\ngeneral public, and terms that have special meaning or are used as proper nouns should be defined and explained. Such terms include but are not\nlimited to: closing; closing date; tenant-shareholder; sponsor; selling agent; cooperative apartment or unit; maintenance charges; filing; proprietary lease; effective date; assessments; and holder of unsold shares. Terms must be used consistently throughout the offering plan. (e) Introduction. The introduction should: (1)\nexplain that the purpose of the offering plan is to set forth all the terms of the offer. Explain that the plan may be amended from time to time when\nan amendment is filed with the New York State Department of Law. State that amendments will be served on purchasers and shareholders; (2)\ndescribe the type of interest that the apartment corporation is to acquire in the land and building(s) and\nappurtenances thereto; (3)\nidentify the sponsor, state when the sponsor acquired the property or\nsponsor's interest as a contract vendee; (4)\ndisclose sponsor's intent with regard to the sale of\napartments offered in the plan. Disclose whether sponsor represents that it will endeavor in good faith to sell, in a reasonably timely manner, all\nresidential units to purchasers for personal occupancy in the building or buildings being constructed for cooperative ownership. If sponsor has\nobtained construction financing, disclose the terms of the construction loan as they apply to the sponsor's obligation to market the units for sale, including any minimum number or percentage of units which must be under contract before the plan can be declared effective, the existence of either a\nminimum release price set by the lender or a required minimum payment per sale which must be made to the lender and limits or requirements imposed by\nthe lender for sponsor to rent rather than sell under specified market conditions. If sponsor has not obtained construction financing or if the\nconstruction loan agreement does not include provisions on the terms set forth in the previous sentence, disclose the conditions under which sponsor\nreserves the right to rent rather than sell based on objective articulable criteria, such as a significant decline in market prices of a specific\npercentage and the conditions under which sponsor would resume sales. If sponsor represents an intent to sell fewer than all of the units in the\nbuilding or buildings being constructed for cooperative ownership, disclose the number and percentage which sponsor does intend to sell. Disclose\nwhether sponsor represents that it will decline to rent apartments, until it has sold at least 51 percent of the units to purchasers for personal\noccupancy. If sponsor reserves the right to rent rather than sell after reaching the 51 percent sales level, disclose the conditions under which\nsponsor would rent rather than sell based on objective articulable criteria, such as a significant decline in market prices of a specific percentage\nand the conditions under which sponsor would resume its good faith efforts to sell rather than rent. If sponsor does not represent its good faith\nintent to sell and to obtain sales of 51 percent of the units prior to renting, include on the cover of the plan the warning set forth in paragraph\n(c)(1) of this section and discuss as a special risk; (5)\nsummarize the number of shares and units being\noffered in this offering plan, whether the units are residential or otherwise, any parking and recreational facilities and refer to schedule A for\nprices. Identify any units or property interests that are not being offered. If the building is an existing building, state whether it is being\nrehabilitated; (6)\nstate that the prices were approved by the sponsor and are not subject to approval by\nthe Department of Law or any other government agency; (7)\nstate that the plan, including all schedules\nand parts A, B and C of the exhibits, constitute the entire offer and that copies of the plan and parts A, B and C of the exhibits will be available\nfor inspection without charge to prospectus purchasers at the site whenever the on- site sales office is open and at the office of the selling agent\nor sponsor; (8)\nif the plan involves new construction or rehabilitation, state the approximate\nconstruction timetable for completion of the cooperative; (9)\noutline the basic aspects of cooperative\nownership, including the following: (i) that the apartment corporation will purchase the property and will sell\nshares to purchasers to raise funds; (ii)\neach shareholder will enter into a proprietary lease; (iii)\nany restrictions on using, transferring, leasing or mortgaging the units and shares; (iv)\ncontrol of the apartment corporation will be in the hands of the board of directors; disclose whether sponsor\nrepresents and provides in the bylaws, that a majority of the apartment corporation board must be owner-occupants of the building or members of an\nowner-occupant's household, who are unrelated to the sponsor or its principals, after the end of the sponsor control period. If sponsor does not make\nthis representation, include the warning set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and discuss as a special risk; (v) each shareholder will have the right to vote for members of the board of directors; (vi)\neach shareholder will be responsible for the payment of maintenance charges and assessments; (vii)\nthe apartment corporation, as the fee owner of the entire building, is assessed for the real estate taxes on\nthe property and may be the mortgagor on a mortgage encumbering the entire property. As a result, sharesholders are co-dependent on each other and on\nthe sponsor for payment of the mortgage and taxes, default on which will jeopardize each shareholder's equity in his/her shares and unit. Where the\nsponsor owns a substantial percentage of the units, a default in payment of maintenance by sponsor jeopardizes the equity interest of other\nsharesholders; (10)\nstate any limitations on who may purchase units provided that such\nlimitations do not violate applicable laws; (11)\ninclude the following paragraph printed in bold face\ncommon type at least as large as 10-point modern type and at least 2 points leaded: THE PURCHASE OF A COOPERATIVE HAS MANY SIGNIFICANT LEGAL AND FINANCIAL\nCONSEQUENCES AND MAY BE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS OF YOUR LIFE. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL STRONGLY URGES YOU TO READ THIS OFFERING\nPLAN CAREFULLY AND TO CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY BEFORE SIGNING A SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT.

Disclose any built-in increases in future years resulting from a fixed amount increase in mortgage debt service and state the dollar\nper share impact; (viii)\nfor projected income tax deduction, explain that the projected tax deduction may\nvary in future years (where applicable) due to changes in the interest rate on the existing mortgage (if any) or on a refinanced mortgage, due to the\nallocation of constant debt service payments to interest and principal, due to the expiration of real estate tax benefits or due to changes in the\nassessed value, the tax rate or in the method of assessing real property which result in a change in real property taxes. State the percentage of the\nbudget for the first year of operation represented by the deductible items. (g) Projected budget for first year of operation of cooperative (schedule B). The plan must describe all projected income and expenses for the first\nyear of cooperative operation in schedule B. The budget must be based upon a specified 12-month period which should be a realistic projection of when\ncooperative operations will begin. If the projected commencement of the budget year in the offering plan differs by six months or more from the\nanticipated date of closing, the plan must be amended to include a revised budget disclosing current projections. If such amended projections exceed\nthe original projections by 25 percent or more, the sponsor must offer all purchasers the right, for a specified reasonable period of time, to\nrescind their offer to purchase and have their deposits refunded. Sponsor's guaranty of the budget will not avoid an offer of rescission. The budget\nfor the cooperative must be in the following format.

The budget for insurance must provide for fire and casualty insurance under an agreed amount\nreplacement value policy or under a policy including an 80 percent coinsurance provision so that the insured shall not be a coinsurer. Discuss the\nadequacy of the insurance to replace the building in the event of total loss and/or to avoid being a coinsurer in the event of partial loss. (a) State whether the insurance coverage satisfies the requirements of any mortgage lender procured by sponsor or\nany requirements of a managing agent contract. (b) Fire, casualty and general liability insurance must\nprovide that there will be no cancellation without notice to the board of directors and waive subrogation.

State whether the sponsor will obtain a further opinion as to reasonable relationship prior to the closing. (2)\n\nState that no change will be made in the size or number of units, the share allocations, the total number of\nshares or in the size or quality of public areas except by amendment to the plan. Holders of unsold shares must comply with this provision. (3)\n\nState that unless an affected purchaser consents, no change will be made in unit size, layout, or share\nallocation if a subscription agreement has been executed and delivered to the sponsor for that unit and the purchaser is not in default. (4)\n\nState that no change will be made in the total number of shares or in the size or quality of public areas\nunless purchasers who executed and delivered subscription agreements to the sponsor and are not in default receive a right to rescind and a\nreasonable and specified period in which to exercise the right.

Highlight as a special risk if there are\nunusual features of the plan which may jeopardize the apartment corporation's qualification or the deductability of interest and taxes by\ntenant-stockholders who itemize deductions in the first year of cooperative operation or thereafter. (2)\n\nIf a permanent, temporary or partial certificate of occupancy has not been issued prior to closing for offering\nplans subject to the provisions of General Business Law section 352-e e, discuss whether the apartment corporation is a cooperative corporation\nwithin the meaning of Internal Revenue Code section 216, including whether tenant-stockholders are entitled to occupy units for dwelling\npurposes.

(4)\n\nSuggested language\nfor the disclaimer of liability is set forth below. (i) This is an opinion, not a guarantee, that the apartment\ncorporation will qualify as a cooperative corporation and that tenant-stockholders will be entitled to income tax deduction. This opinion is based\nsolely on the facts and documents referred to above. No warranties are made that the tax laws upon which counsel base this opinion will not change. In no event will the sponsor, the sponsor's counsel, the apartment corporation, counsel to the apartment corporation, the selling agent or any other\nperson be liable if the apartment corporation ceases to meet the requirements of section\n216\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the New York State Tax Law, as amended, by reason of\nfuture changes in fact or applicable law, regulations, decisional law or Internal Revenue Service rulings. (5)\n\nThe opinion should be signed by a duly authorized signatory or by counsel's firm. (6)\n\nThe opinion must include counsel's consent to include a copy of the opinion in the plan. (k) Real estate tax benefits.

Highlight as a special risk if the plan states that the apartment corporation may or will receive tax benefits and the\nsponsor does not anticipate obtaining the tax benefits before the closing. Describe the efforts the sponsor will make to obtain the tax benefits\nafter closing and the approximate timetable for obtaining the benefits. Highlight as a special risk if any construction or rehabilitation to the\ninterior of units is the responsibility of shareholders and failure to complete such work may have an adverse impact on the availability of tax\nbenefits. (1)\n\nAn opinion from sponsor's counsel or independent counsel must support sponsor's\nrepresentations. (2)\n\nCounsel's opinion may not contain a general disclaimer of liability. It may limit\nliability if the facts represented by sponsor and sponsor's experts are not true or if there are changes in the applicable law, regulations or\ndecisional law. (3)\n\nThe opinion must include counsel's consent to include a copy of the opinion in the\nplan. (4)\n\nThe opinion must be signed by a duly authorized signatory or by counsel's firm.
