  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 235-5.1 - Innovative products\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any\nmanufacturer of consumer products which have been granted an innovative product\nexemption by the CARB under the innovative products provisions in section\n94511, or 94503.5 of\n\nTitle 17\nof the California Code of Regulations (see Table\n1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) shall be\nexempt from the Table of Standards in section\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart for the period of time that the CARB innovative products exemption remains\nin effect provided that all consumer products within the CARB innovative\nproducts exemption are contained in the Table of Standards in section\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart. Any manufacturer claiming such an exemption on this basis must submit to\nthe director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental\n\nConservation a copy of the CARB innovative product exemption decision ('i.e.', the Executive Order), including all conditions established by CARB applicable\nto the exemption. When approved by the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation, the innovative product exemption will\nbe submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a State\n\nImplementation Plan revision for approval. (b) Manufacturers of consumer products that\nhave been granted an innovative products exemption under the innovative\nproducts provisions in section 94511, or 94503.5 of\n\nTitle 17\nof the California\n\nCode of Regulations (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) based on\n\nCalifornia specific data, or that have not been granted an exemption by the\nCARB may seek an innovative products exemption in accordance with the following\ncriteria: (1)\n\nThe director, Division of Air\n\nResources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall exempt a consumer\nproduct from the VOC content limits specified in section\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart if a manufacturer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that, due\nto some characteristic of the product formulation, design, delivery systems or\nother factors, the use of the product will result in less VOC emissions as\ncompared to: (i) the VOC emissions from a\nrepresentative consumer product which complies with the VOC content limits\nspecified in section\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart; or\n(ii)\nthe calculated VOC\nemissions from a non-complying representative product, if the product had been\nreformulated to comply with the VOC content limits specified in section\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart. VOC emissions shall be calculated using the following equation: ER = E\nNC\nx\nVOC\nSTD\n÷ VOC\nNC\nwhere: ER = the VOC emissions from the non-complying\nrepresentative product, had it been reformulated. E\nNC\n= the VOC emissions from the\nnon-complying representative product in its current formulation. VOC\nSTD\n= the VOC content limit\nspecified in the Table of Standards in section\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart. VOC\nNC\n= the VOC content of the\nnon-complying product in its current formulation. If a manufacturer demonstrates that this equation yields\ninaccurate results due to some characteristic of the product formulation or\nother factors, an alternative method which accurately calculates emissions may\nbe used upon approval of the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation. (2)\n\nFor the purposes of this Subpart, 'representative consumer product' means a consumer product which meets all of\nthe following criteria: (i) the\nrepresentative product shall be subject to the same VOC content limit in\nsection\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart as the innovative product; (ii)\nthe representative product shall be of\nthe same product form as the innovative product, unless the innovative product\nuses a new form which does not exist in the product category at the time the\napplication is made; and\n(iii)\nthe\nrepresentative product shall have at least similar efficacy as other consumer\nproducts in the same product category based on tests generally accepted for\nthat product category by the consumer products industry. (3)\nA manufacturer shall apply in writing to\nthe director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental\n\nConservation for any exemption claimed under paragraph (1) of this subdivision. The application shall include the supporting documentation that demonstrates\nthe emissions from the innovative product, including the actual physical test\nmethods used to generate the data and, if necessary, the consumer testing\nundertaken to document product usage. In addition, the applicant must provide\nany information necessary to enable the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation to establish enforceable conditions\nfor granting the exemption including the VOC content for the innovative product\nand test methods for determining the VOC content. All information submitted by\na manufacturer pursuant to this Subpart shall be handled in accordance with the\nprocedures specified in applicable New York State confidentiality\nrequirements. (4)\n\nWithin 30 days of\nreceipt of the exemption application, the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall determine whether an application\nis complete as provided in applicable New York State laws or\nregulations. (5)\n\nWithin 90 days\nafter an application has been deemed complete, the director, Division of Air\n\nResources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall determine whether, under what conditions, and to what extent, an exemption from the requirements\nof section\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart will be permitted. The applicant and the director, Division of Air\n\nResources, Department of Environmental Conservation may mutually agree to a\nlonger time period for reaching a decision, and additional supporting\ndocumentation may be submitted by the applicant before a decision has been\nreached. The director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental\n\nConservation shall notify the applicant of the decision in writing and specify\nsuch terms and conditions that are necessary to insure that emissions from the\nproduct will meet the emissions reductions specified in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, and that such emissions reductions can be enforced. When approved\nby the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental\n\nConservation, the innovative product exemption will be submitted to the United\n\nStates Environmental Protection Agency as a State Implementation Plan revision\nfor approval. (6)\n\nIn granting an\nexemption for a product, the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation shall establish conditions that are enforceable. These conditions shall include the VOC content of the\ninnovative product, dispensing rates, application rates and any other\nparameters determined by the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation to be necessary. The director, Division of Air\n\nResources, Department of Environmental Conservation shall also specify the test\nmethods for determining conformance to the conditions established. The test\nmethods shall include criteria for reproducibility, accuracy, sampling and\nlaboratory procedures. (7)\n\nFor any product for which an exemption has been granted pursuant to this\n\nSubpart, the manufacturer shall notify the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation in writing within 30 days of any\nchange in the product formulation or recommended product usage directions, and\nshall also notify the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation within 30 days if the manufacturer learns of any\ninformation which would alter the emissions estimates submitted to the\ndirector, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation\nin support of the exemption application. (8)\n\nIf the VOC content limits specified in\nsection\n235-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart are lowered for a product category through any subsequent rule making, all\ninnovative product exemptions granted for products in the product category, except as provided in this paragraph, shall have no force and effect as of the\neffective date of the modified VOC content limit. This paragraph shall not\napply to those innovative products which have VOC emissions less than the\napplicable lowered VOC content limit and for which a written notification of\nthe product 's emissions status versus the lowered VOC content limit has been\nsubmitted to and approved by the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation at least 60 days before the effective\ndate of such limits. (9)\n\nIf the\ndirector, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation\nbelieves that a consumer product for which an exemption has been granted no\nlonger meets the criteria for an innovative product specified in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision, the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation may review, and for good cause, modify or revoke the\nexemption in accordance with Part 621 of this Title and the procedures therein\nas necessary to assure that the product will meet these criteria.
