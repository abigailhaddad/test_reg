  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.7 - Consistency\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1160 ]\nConsistency refers to continued\nuniformity, during a period and from one period to another, in methods of\naccounting, mainly in valuation bases and methods of accrual, as reflected in\nthe financial statements of an accounting entity, e.g., change\nfrom FIFO inventory method to the LIFO method. Consistency is very important to\nthe development and analysis of trends on a year-to-year basis and as a means\nof forecasting. However, consistency does not require continued adherence to a\nmethod of procedure that is incorrect or no longer useful, nor does it preclude\na justifiable and desirable change in accounting and reporting methods or\nprocedures unless otherwise specified in this manual. Any such change must be\nhighlighted in submitting reports to HCFA by appropriate footnotes on all\nschedules which are affected by the change. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n442.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
