  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 500.4 - Testing equipment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\nwater-works corporation, unless specifically excused by the commission, shall\nprovide for and have available such meter testing laboratory or shop, standard\nmeters, instruments, and other facilities as may be deemed necessary by the\ncommission properly to make the tests required herein. Such equipment and\nfacilities shall be acceptable to the commission and shall be available at all\nreasonable times for inspection and use by authorized representatives of the\ncommission. Water-works corporations may co-operate in arranging for meter\ntesting facilities. Tests for accuracy of such equipment will be made at such\nintervals as the commission may deem necessary. (b) Requests to be excused from the\nprovisions of subdivision (a) of this section will be considered from\nwater-works corporations having less than 100 meters in service when\nsatisfactory arrangements are made for testing of meters at approved\nlaboratories; or from companies which arrange for all facilities prescribed\nherein at approved locations elsewhere than on the premises of said\ncompany. (c) The minimum equipment\nrequired for registration tests is as follows: (1)\nA quick-acting valve on the discharge\npipe through the use of which the flow can be started and stopped without\nappreciable loss of time. (2)\nA\nvalve and an orifice attachment on the outlet side of the meter, either of\nwhich can be used to establish the rate of flow desired. (3)\n\nPressure gauges connected on both the\ninlet and outlet of the meter to show whether any material change in pressure\noccurs during the period of test, which would affect the rate of flow. The\noutlet pipe is to have sufficient head on it so that the meter will always have\npressure on its outlet end and preferably not less than five pounds per square\ninch. (4)\nA measuring device which\nmay be either of the volumetric or weighing type. Whichever is used, the\naccuracy of determination of the volume or weight of water discharged into the\nmeasuring device must be such as to bring the limit of error within one quarter\nof one percent. (5)\n\nIt is desirable\nto have available for testing meters a test table and appurtenances which are\nmanufactured by several concerns. Such an outfit would include the equipment\nenumerated in the preceding four paragraphs. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n500.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
