  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 41.4 - Computation of the revenue-producing circuit miles factor\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The revenue-producing circuit miles\nfactor is determined by: (1)\nmultiplying the\naverage length in miles of revenue-producing communications pathways within New\n\nYork State used in connection with interstate and/or foreign transmission\nservices by the number of revenue-producing channels within such\npathways; (2)\nmultiplying the\naverage length in miles of revenue-producing communications pathways within and\nwithout New York State used in connection with interstate and/or foreign\ntransmission services by the number of revenue-producing channels within such\npathways; and\n(3)\ndividing the\nproduct computed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision by the product computed\nin paragraph (2). (b) The term communications pathways means any conduit, wire, cable, fiber optical\npath, microwave signal path, radio signal path or other pathways over which\ntransmissions can be carried. The average length in miles of the\nrevenue-producing communications pathway of satellite repeater facilities or\nother satellite communications facilities is deemed to be the shortest distance\nover the surface of the earth between the point on the earth from which signals\nare sent to the satellite and the point on the earth where such signals are\nreceived from the satellite. The average length of revenue-producing\ncommunications pathways is computed on a quarterly basis. At the option of the\ntaxpayer, a more frequent basis such as monthly, weekly or daily may be used. The same basis must be used consistently with respect to such pathways within\nand without New York State. (c) The\nterm channel means the smallest discrete circuit or other means whereby a\nmessage, conversation, data set or signal may be transmitted, which cannot be\nsubdivided without destroying or diminishing its capacity to carry such\ntransmissions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n41.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
