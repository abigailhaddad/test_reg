  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10, app 75-A § 75-A.9 - Alternative subsurface treatment systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. Alternative subsurface treatment systems described in this section can be\ninstalled when site conditions exist that do not allow the use of conventional\nsubsurface treatment systems. (b) Raised System. (1)\nA raised system is an\nabsorption trench system constructed in fill material with acceptable\npermeability placed above the natural soil on a building lot. (2)\n\nSite Requirements. A raised system may be\nused where all the following conditions are found: (i) There is at least one foot of original\nsoil with a faster than 60 minutes percolation rate, above any impermeable soil\nlayer or bedrock, but not more than two feet. (ii)\n\nThe maximum high groundwater level must\nbe at least one foot below the original ground surface. (iii)\n\nSlopes shall not exceed 15%. (iv)\n\nAll minimum vertical and horizontal\nseparation distances can be maintained as described in Table 2. (3)\n\nDesign Criteria. (i) Percolation tests shall be conducted in\nthe fill material at the borrow pit and after placement and setting at the\nconstruction site. The slower percolation rate of these tests shall be used for\ndesign purposes. (ii)\n\nThe total\narea beneath the absorption trenches, extending 2.5 feet in all directions from\nthe outer edge of all trenches, is defined as the basal area. The minimum size\nof the basal area of the raised system shall be calculated based upon 0.2\ngpd/sq. ft. A conventional absorption trench system as described in subdivision\n75-A.8(b) is to be designed using the percolation rate of the fill material. The use of slowly permeable soils for the fill material will result in a trench\nsystem that will have a basal area larger than the minimum area calculated\nusing 0.2 gpd/sq. ft. (iii)\n\nThe\nminimum size of the basal area of a raised system designed to receive effluent\nfrom an ETU located in an area described in subclauses 75- A.6(b)(6)(ii)(d)(1)\nor (2), shall be calculated based upon 0.3 gpd/sq. ft. A conventional\nabsorption trench system as described in subdivision 75-A.8(b) is to be\ndesigned to distribute effluent evenly over the fill material basal\narea. (iv)\n\nSufficient fill material\nwith a percolation rate of between 5 - 30 min/in is required to maintain at\nleast two feet separation between the proposed bottom of the trenches and any\nboundary condition such as groundwater, bedrock, clay or other relatively\nimpermeable soil or formation. (v) The edge of the fill material shall be tapered at a slope of no greater than\none vertical to three horizontal with a minimum 20 foot taper. (vi)\n\nHorizontal separation distances shall be\nmeasured from the outside edge of the taper. (vii)\n\nThe system shall incorporate siphon\ndosing, pump dosing or pressure distribution. Gravity distribution may be\nallowed where both the following conditions are met: (a) the local health department has a program\nincorporating site evaluation, system design approval, and construction\ninspection/certification; and\n(b) a\nminimum of two feet of fill material with a percolation rate of 5 - 30 min/in\nshall be placed between the bottom of the trenches and the existing\nground. (viii)\n\nCurtain\ndrains may be used to intercept and carry underground water away where high\ngroundwater levels exist. Curtain drains shall be upslope from the system and\nat least 20 feet from the toe of slope of the fill material. (4)\n\nConstruction. (i) Heavy construction equipment shall not be\nallowed within the area of the system. The underlying soil shall be undisturbed\nalthough the surface may be plowed with at least a double bottomed blade/furrow\nplow and the furrow turned upslope. (ii)\nA system shall not be built in\nunstabilized fill material. The fill material shall be allowed to settle\nnaturally for a period of at least six months to include one freeze-thaw cycle, or may be stabilized by mechanical compaction in shallow lifts if a fill\nmaterial consisting of only a granular sand or sandy loam is used. (iii)\n\nThe absorption trenches shall be\nconstructed in the fill material. (iv)\n\nThe entire surface of the system\nincluding the tapers shall be covered with a minimum of six inches of topsoil, mounded to enhance the runoff of rainwater from the system and seeded to\ngrass. (v) On sloping sites a\ndiversion ditch or curtain drain small be installed uphill to prevent surface\nwater runoff from reaching the raised system area. (c) Mounds. (1)\n\nGeneral. A mound system is a soil\nabsorption system that is elevated above the natural soil surface in a suitable\nfill material. It is a variation of the raised bed utilizing sandy fill\nmaterial but not requiring a stabilization period prior to the construction of\nthe absorption area. On sites with permeable soils of insufficient depth to\ngroundwater or creviced or porous bedrock, the fill material in the mound\nprovides the necessary treatment of wastewater. The overall size of the mound\nsystem will normally be substantially smaller than a raised bed. (2)\n\nSite Requirements. A mound system may be\nused where all the following conditions are found: (i) The maximum high groundwater level must\nbe at least one foot below the original ground surface. (ii)\n\nBedrock shall be at least two feet below\nthe natural ground surface. (iii)\n\nThe percolation rate of the naturally occurring soil shall be faster than 120\nminutes/inch. (iv)\n\nThe natural\nground slopes shall not exceed 12%. (v) All minimum horizontal separation\ndistances can be maintained as described in Table 2. (3)\n\nDesign Criteria. (i) The designer shall consult with the\nhealth unit having jurisdiction regarding the method for detailing the\nhydraulic design. (ii)\n\nThe basal\narea of a mound system is defined differently than a raised bed. The basal area\nfor a system on level ground includes all the area beneath the absorption\ntrenches or bed and the area under the tapers. On a sloping site, the basal\narea includes only the area under the absorption trenches/bed and the lower or\ndownhill taper. The basal area is designed upon the percolation of the\nnaturally occurring soil. Where the percolation rate is 60 min/in or faster, refer to Table 4B. For soils of 61 to 120 min/in, a rate of 0.2 gpd/sq. ft. shall be used for determining the minimum basal area required. (iii)\n\nPercolation tests for the fill material\nshall be conducted at the borrow pit. Only soils with a percolation rate\nbetween five and 30 minutes per inch shall be used for the fill material. Sands\nwith greater than 10 percent by weight finer than 0.05 mm material must be\navoided. At least 25 percent of the material by weight shall be in the range of\n0.50 mm to 2.0 mm. Less than 15 percent of the material by weight shall be\nlarger than half-inch sieve. A sieve analysis may be necessary to verify this\nrequirement. The required absorption area is based upon the percolation rate of\nthe fill material as determined from Table 4B. (iv)\n\nThe system shall be designed to run\nparallel with the contours of the site. The width of the system (up and down\nthe slope) shall be kept to a minimum, but in not case shall the absorption\narea be wider than 20 feet. In a distribution network using a center pressure\nmanifold, distribution lines shall have a maximum total length of 200 feet. In\na network using an end manifold, distribution lines shall have a maximum length\nof 100 feet. (v) Mound dimensions\nshall meet or exceed those required by the health unit having\njurisdiction. (vi)\nA pressure\ndistribution network shall be required. (vii)\nA dual chamber septic tank or two tanks\nin series in addition to the dosing tank shall be provided. A gas baffle or\nother outlet modification that enhances solids retention is\nrecommended. (4)\n\nConstruction. (i) Heavy construction\nequipment shall not be allowed within the basal area and area downslope of the\nsystem which will act as the dispersal area for the mound. (ii)\n\nThe vegetation shall not be scraped\naway, roto-tilled, or compacted. Excess vegetation shall be removed with trees\ncut at the ground surface but stumps left in place. The area shall be plowed to\na depth of seven or eight inches with a double bottomed blade/furrow plow and\nthe furrow turned upslope. (iii)\n\nThe fill material is placed from the upslope side of the system to the full\ndepth required in the design and shall extend to the edge of the basal area at\na slope not to exceed one vertical to three horizontal. (iv)\n\nThe absorption area is then formed\nwithin the mound. A minimum of six inches of aggregate shall be placed beneath\nthe distribution lines. (v) The\npressure distribution lines are placed parallel to the contours of the slope\nand a minimum of two inches of aggregate is placed above the lines. (vi)\nA permeable geotextile is placed over\nthe entire absorption area to prevent the infiltration of fines into the\naggregate. (vii)\n\nOn sloping sites a\ndiversion ditch or curtain drain shall be installed uphill to prevent surface\nwater runoff from reaching the absorption area. (viii)\nA minimum of six inches of finer\nmaterials such as clayey loam is placed over the top of the absorption area, and the entire mound including the tapers is then covered with six inches of\ntop soil and seeded to grass. (d) Intermittent Sand Filters. (1)\n\nGeneral. In a sand filter, the septic\ntank or aerobic unit effluent is intermittently spread across the surface of a\nbed of sand through a network of distribution lines. Collector pipes beneath\nthe filter collect treated effluent after it has passed through the\nsand. (2)\n\nSite Requirements. (i) All horizontal separation distances shown\nin Table 2 must be met and the minimum required vertical separation to\ngroundwater must be met from the bottom of the collector pipes. (ii)\n\nAn environmental assessment determines\nthat the development of the site with a sand filter is consistent with the\noverall development of the area and will cause no adverse environmental\nimpacts. (3)\n\nDesign\n\nCriteria. (i) Septic tanks installed before a\nsand filter shall have dual compartments or two tanks in series. The use of a\ngas baffle on the outlet is strongly recommended. (ii)\n\nThe direct discharge of sand filter\neffluent to the ground surface or to a body of water shall not be approved by\nthe Department of Health or a local health department acting as its\nagent. (iii)\n\nDistributor lines\nshall be placed at three foot center lines as level as possible. (iv)\n\nCollector pipes shall be centered\nbetween distribution lines at a slope of 1/16 to 1/8 inch per foot. (v) Effluent shall be distributed to the sand\nfilter by means of pressure distribution or dosing (siphon or pump). Gravity\ndistribution may be used to apply effluent to small filters having less than\n300 lineal feet of four-inch diameter distributors or less than 900 square feet\nof filter area. Pressure distribution lines shall be a minimum of one inch and\na maximum of three inches in diameter. Pressure distribution pumps shall be\nselected to maintain a minimum pressure of one pound per square inch (2.3 feet\nof head) at a downstream end of each distribution line during the distribution\ncycle. If siphon or pump dosing is allowed, the distributor pipe(s) shall have\na diameter of three to four inches. (vi)\n\nThe distribution system small be\ndesigned to dose the filter at least three times daily based upon the design\nflow rates with each dose. (vii)\n\nThe sand media shall have an effective grain size of 0.25 to 1.0 mm. If\nnitrification is not required by the local health department, the effective\ngrain size shall be in the range of 0.5 to 1.00 mm. All sand shall pass a 1/4\ninch sieve. (viii)\n\nThe uniformity\ncoefficient of the sand shall not exceed 4.0. (ix)\n\nThe maximum allowed daily sand loading\nrate shall be 1.15 gal/day/sq. ft. (x) Effluent from the collector pipes shall\nbe discharged to an absorption bed located below the original ground level or a\nmound that is built up above the original ground surface. The size of the\nbed/mound shall be based upon the estimated quantity of effluent reaching the\ncollector pipe and an application rate of 1.2 gal/day/sq. ft. regardless of the\nunderlying soil percolation. The fill material for the bed/mound shall consist\nof medium sand with a percolation rate, tested at the borrow pit, not faster\nthan five minutes per inch. All minimum vertical and horizontal separation\ndistances shall be maintained as described in Section 75-A.4. (4)\n\nConstruction. (i) After excavation, the collector pipe\nshall be placed in 3/4 inches to 1 1/2 inches size aggregate. (ii)\n\nThere shall be a minimum of four inches\nof this aggregate beneath the entire system above the collectors. (iii)\nA three inch layer of crushed stone or\nclean gravel with a size of 1/8 inches to 1/4 inches is carefully placed on top\nof the aggregate. (iv)\nA minimum of\n24 inches of the approved sand is placed above the crushed stone or\ngravel. (v) The distributor pipes\nare placed in a layer of aggregate that provides a minimum of four inches\nacross the entire surface of the filter and at least two inches above and below\nthe distributor pipes. (vi)\nA\npermeable geotextile, two inches of hay or straw, or untreated building paper\nis placed over the entire bed area to prevent the infiltration of fines into\nthe filter. (vii)\n\nThe entire\nsurface of the filter shall be covered with six to 12 inches of topsoil, mounded to enhance the runoff of rainwater from the system and seeded to\ngrass. (viii)\n\nThe bed/mound\nfollowing the filter shall be covered with 12 inches of topsoil and seeded to\ngrass. (e) Repealed\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
