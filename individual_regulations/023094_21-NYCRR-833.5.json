Tit. 21 § 833.5 - Classification of projects for review under section 3.8 of the Compact\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as the\nexecutive director may specially direct by notice to the project owner or\nsponsor, or as a State or Federal agency may refer under subdivision (c) of\nthis section, a project in any of the following classifications will be deemed\nnot to have a substantial effect on the water resources of the basin and is not\nrequired to be submitted under section\n3.8\nof the Compact: (1)\n\nThe construction of new impoundments or\nthe enlargement or removal of existing impoundments, for whatever purpose, when\nthe storage capacity is less than 100 million gallons. (2)\nA withdrawal from ground water for any\npurpose when the daily average gross withdrawal during any 30 consecutive day\nperiod does not exceed 100,000 gallons. (3)\nA withdrawal from impoundments or running\nstreams for any purpose when the daily average gross withdrawal during any 30\nconsecutive day period does not exceed 100,000 gallons. (4)\n\nThe construction of new domestic sewage\ntreatment facilities or alteration or addition to existing domestic sewage\ntreatment facilities when the design capacity of such facilities is less than a\ndaily average rate of 10,000 gallons per day in the drainage area to\noutstanding basin waters and significant resource waters or less than 50,000\ngallons per day elsewhere in the basin; and all local sewage collector systems\nand improvements discharging into authorized trunk sewage systems. (5)\n\nThe construction of new facilities or\nalteration or addition to existing facilities for the direct discharge to\nsurface or ground waters of industrial wastewater having design capacity of\nless than 10,000 gallons per day in the drainage area to outstanding basin\nwaters and significant resource waters or less than 50,000 gallons per day\nelsewhere in the basin; except where such wastewater contains toxic\nconcentrations of waste materials. (6)\nA change in land cover on major ground\nwater infiltration areas when the amount of land that would be altered is less\nthan three square miles. (7)\n\nDeepening, widening, cleaning or dredging existing stream beds or relocating\nany channel, and the placement of fill or construction of dikes, on streams\nwithin the basin except the Delaware River and tidal portions of tributaries\nthereto, and streams draining more than one state. (8)\n\nPeriodic maintenance dredging. (9)\n\nEncroachments on streams within the basin\ncaused by: (i) floating docks and anchorages\nand buoys and navigational aids; (ii)\ntemporary construction such as\ncauseways, cofferdams and falsework required to facilitate construction on\npermanent structures. (10)\n\nBridges and highways unless they would\npass in or across an existing or proposed reservoir or recreation project area\nas designated in the comprehensive plan. (11)\n\nLiquid petroleum products pipelines and\nappurtenances designed to operate under pressures less than 150 psi; local\nelectric distribution lines and appurtenances; local communication lines and\nappurtenances; local natural and manufactured gas distribution lines and\nappurtenances; local water distribution lines and appurtenances; and local\nsanitary sewer mains, unless such lines would involve significant disturbance\nof ground cover affecting water resources. (12)\n\nElectric transmission or bulk power\nsystem lines and appurtenances; major trunk communication lines and\nappurtenances; natural and manufactured gas transmission lines and\nappurtenances; major water transmission lines and appurtenances; unless they\nwould pass in, on, under or across an existing or proposed reservoir or\nrecreation project area as designated in the comprehensive plan, unless such\nlines would involve significant disturbance of ground cover affecting water\nresources. (13)\n\nLiquid petroleum\nproducts pipelines and appurtenances designed to operate under pressures of\nmore than 150 psi, unless they would pass in, on, under or across an existing\nor proposed reservoir or recreation project area as designated in the\ncomprehensive plan, or in, on, under or across any stream within the basin, unless such lines would involve significant disturbance of ground cover\naffecting water resources. (14)\n\nLandfill projects unless no State-level review and permit system is in effect; broad regional consequences are anticipated; or the standards or criteria used\nin State level review are not adequate to protect the water of the basin for\nthe purposes prescribed in the comprehensive plan. (15)\n\nDraining, filling or otherwise altering\nmarshes or wetlands when the area affected is less than 25 acres; provided, however, that areas less than 25 acres shall be subject to commission review\nand action: (i) where neither a State nor a\n\nFederal level review and permit system is in effect, and the executive director\ndetermines that a project is of major regional or interstate significance\nrequiring action by the commission; or\n(ii)\nwhen a commissioner or the executive\ndirector determines that the final action of a State or Federal permitting\nagency may not adequately reflect the commission's policy as to wetlands of the\nbasin. In the case of a project affecting less than 25 acres for\nwhich there has been issued a State or Federal permit, a determination to\nundertake review and action by the commission shall be made no later than 30\ndays following notification of the commission of such permit action. The\nexecutive director, with the approval of the chairman, may at any time within\nthe 30-day period inform any permit holder, signatory party or other interested\nparty that the commission will decline to undertake review and action\nconcerning any such project. (16)\n\nThe diversion or transfer of water from\nthe Delaware River Basin (exportation) whenever the design capacity is less\nthan a daily average rate of 100,000 gallons. (17)\n\nThe diversion or transfer of water into\nthe Delaware River Basin (importation) whenever the design capacity is less\nthan a daily average rate of 100,000 gallons except when the imported water is\nwastewater. (18)\n\nThe diversion or\ntransfer of wastewater into the Delaware River Basin (importation) whenever the\ndesign capacity is less than a daily average rate of 50,000 gallons. (19)\n\nTemporary or short term projects\ndetermined to have nonsubstantial impact on the water resources of the basin by\nthe executive director. (b) All other projects which have or may have\na substantial effect on the water resources of the basin shall be submitted to\nthe commission in accordance with these regulations for determination as to\nwhether the project impairs or conflicts with the comprehensive plan.

(c) Whenever a State or Federal agency\ndetermines that a project falling within an excluded classification (as defined\nin subdivision [a] of this section) may have a substantial effect on the water\nresources of the basin, such project may be referred by the State or Federal\nagency to the commission for action under these rules. (d) Except as otherwise provided by section\n833.8\nof this Title, the sponsor\nshall submit an application for review and approval of a project included under\nsubdivision (b) of this section, through the appropriate agency of a signatory\nparty.
