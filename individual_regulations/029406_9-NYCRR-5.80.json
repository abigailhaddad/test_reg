  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5.80 - Executive Order No. 80: Establishing the Temporary Commission to Commemorate the Centennial of the Governorship of Theodore Roosevelt. [*]\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the year 1998 marks the centennial of the\nemergence of Theodore Roosevelt as a New Yorker of national renown and his\nelection as Governor of New York. His prominence in the public realm began in\nhis twenties as a member of the State Assembly, and carried over into his\nthirties, when he served as the United States Civil Service Commissioner, the\n\nNew York City Police Commissioner and as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. While\nany single one of these personal achievements and contributions to the citizens\nof the State of New York and the United States of America alone would have been\nnoteworthy enough to preserve his permanent place in history as a great\n\nAmerican, it was not until he assumed the Governorship of the State of New York\nin January 1899, that Theodore Roosevelt, only 41 years of age, occupied a\nposition that was worthy of his talents, zeal, probity, vision and\ncharacter. WHEREAS, the significant accomplishments of Theodore\n\nRoosevelt's 24-month Governorship have been overshadowed somewhat by the\neverlasting fame of his later achievements and ebullient personality as\n\nPresident, national politician, statesman, writer, and explorer. Nevertheless, these two years would prove to be a defining period, an impressive \"dress\nrehearsal\" of sorts, for one of the greatest American presidents of all\ntime. WHEREAS, the most salient attributes of Roosevelt's\n\nGovernorship were his tireless efforts to promote efficiency and honesty in\ngovernment, fairness and civility in society at large, and responsibility for\nthe well-being of future generations, other aspects of his legacy are still\ntangible to those of us living in New York today. The conservation of New\n\nYork's bountiful natural resources, the reform of government excess and an\ninsistence upon the widest possible citizen participation in determining a\ncommunity's direction are timeless reflections of Roosevelt's brand of\nprogressive Republicanism. These lasting legacies of Theodore Roosevelt\nattracted enthusiastic approval at the dawn of the new century and have held an\nirresistible appeal for generations of forward looking leaders in this State\never since. These traits which Roosevelt so bullishly personified are as\ndeserving of being honored today as they were a hundred years ago. WHEREAS, at the dawn of another century, as we recall\n\nTheodore Roosevelt's vibrant life and robust populist legacy longingly, with\nboth admiration and affection, it is uniquely fitting that we mark the\nanniversaries and achievements of his career during the pivotal years of 1898\nthrough 1900 in a manner that brings his story into sharper focus for all New\n\nYorkers today, and especially the young. NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE E. PATAKI, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\n\nLaws of the State of New York, do hereby establish the Temporary Commission to\n\nCommemorate the Centennial of the Governorship of Theodore Roosevelt. The purpose of the Temporary Commission will be to\ninitiate, coordinate and facilitate commemorative events, exhibits, publications, broadcasts, and related programs and projects, working in\nassociation with appropriate Federal, State and local government agencies, nonprofit and educational organizations and private citizens. The Temporary Commission is hereby authorized to call upon\nany agency, department, office, division or public authority of this State to\nsupply it with data and other information, personnel and assistance it deems\nnecessary to discharge its duties under this Order. Each agency, department, office, division or public authority of this State is hereby required, to the\nextent not inconsistent with law, to cooperate with the Temporary Commission\nand to furnish it with such information, personnel and assistance as is\nnecessary to accomplish the purpose of this Order. Members of this Temporary Commission, who shall be\nappointed by the Governor, shall receive no compensation, but shall be entitled\nto reimbursement for any necessary expenses incurred in connection with the\nperformance of their duties. The Temporary Commission shall be chaired by a\nmember designated by the Governor and shall exist for the duration of the\ncommemoration period, ending December 31, 2000. Signed: George E. Pataki\n\nDated: May 8, 1998\n\nFootnotes\n*\n[Revoked by Executive Order\n\nNo. 5 (Eliot Spitzer), infra. ] [Revoked by Executive Order No. 9 (David A.
