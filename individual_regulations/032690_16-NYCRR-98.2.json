If a utility receives an application for underground\nresidential service outside a subdivision, and a governmental authority having\njurisdiction to do so has required that the facilities be installed\nunderground, the utility may, if the cost of installing the necessary\nfacilities will be greater than two times the cost of installing such\nfacilities calculated using the applicable charges per foot filed pursuant to\nsection\n98.6\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Part and as set forth in the utility's tariff, petition the Secretary of\nthe Commission to allow a greater contribution to the cost of installation of\nthe facilities than this section would otherwise require, or to set up a\nspecial rate district.

Each utility may file, for\nthe commission's approval, tariff schedules to provide rules for installing, maintaining, repairing and replacing service lines and appurtenant facilities, subject to the requirements of section\n100.1\n(d) of this\n\nTitle for residential subdivisions, or to extend such minimum obligations so\nlong as the provision of additional facilities without such charge or\ncontribution is cost justified. Such rules will be approved based on cost\njustification. Each service line on the applicant's property which runs to the\napplicant's building shall be installed either by the utility, or by the\napplicant in accordance with the utility's specifications, as the utility may\nelect and in accord with the utility's tariff, provided, however, that the\nutility's tariff must permit an applicant for underground service at least to\nexcavate the trench necessary for the underground installation of distribution\nand service lines within a residential subdivision in accord with section\n100.1\n(d) of this\n\nTitle, and provided, further, that allocation of the costs of installation of\noverhead or underground service lines shall be determined in accordance with\nthis section regardless of who installs the service lines.

(l) To the extent practicable, underground\nelectric, communication, and cable television facilities shall be installed in\na common trench when new construction is, or can without undue difficulty, be\nmade simultaneously.

If an underground extension\nis required, the utility shall pay the cost equivalent of up to 1500 feet of\noverhead line extension in addition to the 100-foot underground\nallowance. (2)\n\nSuch applicant must\nown the residential building and real property on which it is located and use\nit as a primary residence on the effective date of these regulations. (3)\n\nSuch applicant must apply to the utility\nfor a line extension within 24 months of the effective date of these\nregulations. (4)\nA utility, which\nincurs the cost of the additional extension, may defer the cost in account 186, miscellaneous deferred debits. This account shall be allowed in rate base in\nthe utility's rate case which follows such deferral. (5)\n\nRequests for inclusion in the low income\nprogram shall be made in writing to the utility. The utility shall report\nquarterly to the Department of Public Service the number of requests received\nand their disposition. (6)\nA\nutility, that receives an application for service under this section, shall\npropose and pay for alternate sources of energy for the applicant up to the\ncost the utility would have paid for an additional line extension, if such\nalternative is less costly and if the applicant agrees. If the applicant does\nnot agree to alternate sources of energy, the utility shall send the\napplication and its proposal to the department's staff for review. The\ndepartment staff shall determine an appropriate resolution based on economic, convenience or environmental factors. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
