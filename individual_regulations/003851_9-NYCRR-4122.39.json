  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4122.39 - Exacta\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The exacta is a\nform of pari-mutuel wagering. Each bettor selects, in order, the first and\nsecond place finisher in the designated exacta race. The exacta pool shall be\nheld entirely separate from all other pools and is in no way a part of the\ndaily double, twin double, or straight, place or show pools. (b) [Reserved]\n(c) Races in which exacta pools shall be\nconducted shall be approved by the commission and shall be clearly designated\nin the racing program. (d) The\ndesign of exacta tickets shall be clearly and immediately distinguishable from\nother pari-mutuel tickets. (e) Winning combination. The numbers of the first two horses as made official shall\nbe the winning combination except that where more than one of such horses is\npart of a coupled entry or field with another of such horses only the best\nfinisher of such horses shall be counted in the winning combination for payoff, and the horse or horses not in such coupled entry or field finishing the same, or, if applicable, next finishing, shall be the other part of the winning\nexacta combination. For example, if two horses in a coupled entry (or field): (1)\nfinish first and second, or in a dead\nheat for first, the winning combination will be the number of such entry or\nfield and the number of the third finishing horse not part of such entry or\nfield; (2)\nfinish first and in a\ndead heat for second, the winning combination will be the number of such entry\nor field and the number of the horse dead heated for second who is not part of\nsuch coupled entry or field; (3)\nfinish in a three-horse dead heat for win with another horse not part of such\nentry or field, the winning combination will be the number of such entry and\nthe number of the horse not part of such entry. (f) Failure to select a winning combination. If no exacta ticket is sold combining the winner and second place horse in\norder, the net pool shall be distributed to holders of exacta tickets\ndesignating the winner to win. In the event one horse only finishes and is\ndeclared winner, the net pool shall be distributed to holders of exacta tickets\ndesignating the winner to win. (g) Dead heat. (1)\n\nIn the event of a dead heat\nfor win, the net pool shall be distributed to each combination of winners\nseparately as in a win pool dead heat. (2)\n\nIn the event of a dead heat for second, the pool shall be divided as in a win pool dead heat among exacta tickets\ncombining the winner with each second place horse. (h) In the event fewer than four betting\ninterests start, the exacta shall be declared off and the gross pool\nrefunded. (i) This rule shall be\nprominently displayed throughout the betting area of each track conducting the\nexacta and printed copies of this rule shall be distributed to patrons upon\nrequest by the track.
