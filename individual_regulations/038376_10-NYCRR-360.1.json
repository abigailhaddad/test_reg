  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 360.1 - Administrative Purpose, Application and Scope\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Administrative\npurpose. Hospitals across New York State, prior to the COVID-19\npandemic, rarely worked together or coordinated as a unified system. But a\npandemic on the scale of the COVID-19 crisis demonstrated that hospitals could\nnot meet the demand of the moment unless a new and innovative system was put\ninto place requiring unprecedented coordination, cooperation, and agility. The\n\nNew York State Department of Health takes note of the successful implementation\nof the Surge and Flex System by New York State's hospitals and offers these\nregulations as an additional way to strengthen the pandemic response. Surge and\n\nFlex Health Coordination System Activation has helped hospitals respond to the\nCOVID-19 state disaster emergency, and New York's hospitals have made\ncommendable efforts to coordinate their response to the pandemic, to direct\npatients to the hospitals with the capacity to treat them, and to increase\ncapacity as needed, during each wave of the pandemic. The COVID-19 crisis demanded a new coordinated approach to\nensure no one hospital was overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients or needed more\nventilators, while a hospital nearby had capacity for more patients and excess\nequipment. It was imperative for government to coordinate and organize all\nhospitals under the umbrella of one unified system, and efficiently use all the\nresources available in the state to attempt to meet the significant demands of\nthe crisis. The \"Surge and Flex\" system is designed to create a single, coordinated statewide system to prevent a disaster from overwhelming any one\nhospital in the state. The purpose of this NYSDOH regulation is to\ninstitutionalize Surge and Flex operation, giving hospitals the time and\nguidance to adequately prepare for a potential future activation of Surge and\n\nFlex. This regulation provides the Department of Health with the necessary\ntools to enact Surge and Flex operation during another wave of COVID-19, or a\nfuture public health emergency. Further, this regulation is designed to help\neach hospital prepare for this contingency in order to ensure a straightforward\ntransition from standard operating procedures to \"Surge and\n\nFlex.\"\n(b) Application and\n\nScope. In the event of a State disaster emergency declared pursuant to section\n28\nof the\n\nExecutive Law, the Commissioner may exercise the authorities granted in this\n\nPart, thereby maximizing the efficiency and effectiveness of the State's\nhospital systems and mitigating the threat to the health of the people of New\n\nYork. Further, this Part establishes certain ongoing emergency planning\nrequirements, called the Surge and Flex Health Care Coordination System, for\nfacilities and agencies regulated by the Department. To the extent that any provision of this Part conflicts with\nany other regulation of the Department, this Part shall take precedence. All\nauthorities granted to the Commissioner shall be subject to any conditions and\nlimitations that the Commissioner may deem appropriate. The Commissioner may\ndelegate activation of the authorities provided by this Part to appropriate\nexecutive staff within the Department. In the event that there are inconsistent\nstatutes, which would preclude effectiveness of such regulation, such\nregulation shall be effective upon the suspension of such inconsistent statute\nby the Governor pursuant to authority in Article 2-B of the Executive Law, and\nsuch regulation shall immediately be effective.
