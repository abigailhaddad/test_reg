  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 541.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe words, terms and phrases used in this Part have the\nfollowing definitions except when the context clearly indicates a different\nmeaning: (a) Construction contract. (1)\nA construction contract means a contract\nto erect, construct, alter, repair or maintain any building or other structure, project, development or other improvement on or to real property, property or\nland. (2)\n\nAll forms of capital\nimprovement contracts, including, but not limited to, a lump sum, time and\nmaterial, cost plus, and any other capital improvement contract are treated the\nsame for sales and use tax purposes. (b) Preexisting contract. (1)\nA preexisting contract means a\nconstruction contract to improve real property by a capital improvement where\nthe amount payable to the contractor or subcontractor is fixed without regard\nto the costs incurred by him which was either: (i) irrevocably entered into prior to the\ndate of enactment of a law increasing the tax rate; or\n(ii)\nresulted from the acceptance by a\ngovernmental agency of a bid accompanied by a bond or other performance\nguaranty irrevocably submitted prior to such date. (2)\n\nWhen a prime contract qualifies as a\npreexisting contract, all subcontracts also qualify as a preexisting contract\neven though one or more of the subcontracts may have been entered into after\nthe date of enactment of a law increasing the tax rate. (3)\n\nThough a contractor must pay tax at the\nrate in effect at the time of purchase, the contractor may be entitled to a\nrefund or credit of the excess tax paid over the preexisting rate with respect\nto purchases used solely in the performance of a preexisting contract. Cross-reference:For application for refund or credit, see\n\nPart 534 of this Title. Example 1:Prior to the enactment date of a law increasing\nthe tax rate, a contractor enters into a contract to erect a building. The\nconstruction contract provides a fixed amount to furnish and install the\nmaterials. Such a contract qualifies as a preexisting contract. Example 2:Prior to the enactment date of a law increasing\nthe tax rate, a contractor enters into a contract to erect a building. The\nconstruction contract provides that the owner (the contractor's customer) will\nreimburse the contractor for the cost of the work plus a fee with a guaranteed\nmaximum cost. Since the contract provides for reimbursement of actual costs\nincurred, which would include sales tax, the amount payable is not fixed with\nregard to costs incurred. Such contract would not qualify as\npreexisting. (4)\n\nChange\norders. [Reserved]\n(c) An agency contract means an agreement which permits a contractor and\nsubcontractor to act as an agent of, that is, in the place of the principal, his customer. Purchases made by the agent-contractor or agent-subcontractor on\nbehalf of the principal are treated in the same manner as if the purchases were\nmade by the principal. All purchases (including rentals of contractor's tools, supplies, machinery and equipment) made by the agent-contractor or\nagent-subcontractor on behalf of the principal are treated in the same manner\nas if the purchases were made by the principal. Cross-reference:For principal/agent relationship, see\nsections\n541.3\n(d)(4)\nand\n541.5\n(c) of this Part. (d) A\nconstruction contractor means any person who engages in erecting, constructing, adding to, altering, improving, repairing, servicing, maintaining, demolishing\nor excavating any building or other structure, property, development, or other\nimprovement on or to real property, property or land. (e) Contractor means a construction\ncontractor, subcontractor or repairman. (f) Real property, property, and land means\nreal property, property or land as defined in subdivision 12 of section\n102\nof the Real Property Tax Law. Among the\nitems considered in this classification are: (1)\nland, including trees thereon and mines\nand quarries therein; (2)\nbuilding\nand structures erected upon, under, or above land, or affixed\nthereto; (3)\nrailroad structures\nand tracks; (4)\ntelephone and\ntelegraph lines, wires, poles and appurtenances; (5)\nmains, pipes and tanks for conducting\nsteam, heat, water, oil, gas and electricity; and\n(6)\nboilers, heating, ventilating, lighting\napparatus and plumbing. Cross-reference:For a detailed discussion and description\nof mobile homes and factory manufactured homes, see Part 544 of this\n\nTitle. (g) Capital improvement. (1)\nA capital\nimprovement means an addition or alteration to real property, which: (i) substantially adds to the value of the\nreal property, or appreciably prolongs the useful life of the real\nproperty; (ii)\nbecomes part of the\nreal property or is permanently affixed to the real property so that removal\nwould cause material damage to the property or article itself; and\n(iii)\nis intended to become a permanent\ninstallation. Example 3:A homeowner hires a general contractor to remove\na portion of a masonry wall for the purpose of installing a door and window. The general contractor hires a masonry contractor (subcontractor) to repair the\nwall. The charge to the contractor by the subcontractor represents a\nconstituent part of the services performed in adding to or improving real\nproperty by a capital improvement and therefore is not subject to tax in\naccordance with section\n527.7\n(b)(4)\nof this Title. (2)\n(i) A\ncapital improvement does not include a contract for the sale and installation\nof tangible personal property which when installed remains tangible personal\nproperty. (ii)\nA capital\nimprovement does not include the sale of tangible property to a customer under\ncontract if the contractor who sells the tangible personal property is not\nresponsible for the affixation or installation of the tangible personal\nproperty furnished. Example 4:A customer enters into an agreement with a\nsupplier to supply all materials necessary for the framing of a home and enters\ninto a separate and distinct agreement with a contractor for the installation\nof the materials purchased from the supplier. The customer is liable for the\npayment of tax on all of the materials purchased from the supplier as the\npurchase is a purchase of tangible personal property and not the purchase of a\ncapital improvement. Upon the issuance of a capital improvement certificate by\nthe customer to the contractor, no tax is due on the labor charge for\ninstalling the materials. (iii)\nA capital improvement does not include\nthe installation of floor covering unless the installation is of the initial\nfinished floor covering in new construction, in a new addition to existing\nconstruction or in a total reconstruction of existing construction. For a\ndetailed discussion of the taxability of the installation of floor covering, see section\n541.14\nof this Part. (iv)\nA capital\nimprovement does not include the installation of a mobile home, regardless of\nhow it is installed. For a detailed discussion of the taxability of mobile\nhomes and factory-manufactured homes, see Part 544 of this Title. (h) Tangible personal\nproperty means corporeal personal property of any nature having a material\nexistence and perceptibility to the human senses, including, but not limited\nto, materials, tools and/or equipment and supplies. (i) The term materials means those items\nwhich become a physical component part of real or personal property such as\nlumber, bricks and steel. (j) The\nterm tools and/or equipment means those items used to perform various functions\nfor a contractor in the conduct of his business activities such as hammers, saws and earth moving equipment. (k) The term supplies means those items which\nare consumed by a contractor in the performance of a contract and which are not\nincorporated into real property such as lubricating oils, sanding disks, gasoline used to operate power equipment and safety apparel. Cross-reference:For examples of tangible personal property, see section\n526.8\nof this Title. (l) Maintaining, servicing, or repairing are terms which are used to cover all\nactivities that relate to keeping real or personal property in a condition of\nfitness, efficiency, readiness or safety, or restoring it to such condition. Among the services included are services on a building itself such as painting; services to the grounds, such as lawn services, tree removal and trimming; trash and garbage removal; sewage service and snow removal. (m) Fabrication is the alteration or\nmodification of tangible personal property to the specifications of the owner\nwithout a change in the identity of the product. Fabrication includes cutting, perforating, and similar operations. Cross-reference:For installation by a fabricator, see\nsection\n541.11\n(b) of this Part. (n) Manufacturing is the production of tangible personal property that has a\ndifferent identity from its ingredients. Manufacturing includes the production\nof standardized items as well as the production of items to a customer's\nspecifications. Cross-reference:For installation by a manufacturer, see\nsection\n541.11\n(c) of this Part. (o) Resident\ncontractor. (1)\nA resident contractor for\nstatewide purposes means any contractor having a place of business in the State\nor engaged in any manner in carrying on any employment, trade, business or\nprofession in New York State regardless of whether incorporated in this State\nor another state or whether the resident contractor may have a place of\nbusiness or conduct any employment, trade, business or profession outside New\n\nYork State. (2)\nA resident\ncontractor for local jurisdictions within New York State means any contractor\nhaving a place of business in a local jurisdiction within New York State or\nengaged in any manner in carrying on any employment, trade, business or\nprofession in a local jurisdiction within New York State regardless of whether\nincorporated in this State or another state or whether the resident contractor\nmay have a place of business or conduct any employment, trade, business or\nprofession outside New York State. (3)\nA nonresident contractor for purposes of\nthe New York State and local sales and use taxes means a contractor who is not\na resident contractor. Example 5:A nonresident, out-of-state contractor, on June\n1st, irrevocably entered into a contract with a company to erect a building in\n\nNew York State. The date the contractor irrevocably entered into the contract, June 1st, is the date the out-of-state contractor's status changed from\nnonresident to resident contractor in New York State. The out-of-state\ncontractor owes the applicable New York State and local sales and compensating\nuse taxes due on the purchase of tools, supplies and equipment purchased and\ndelivered within New York State and on such property purchased outside New York\n\nState on or after June 1st which are subsequently used or consumed in New York\n\nState. Regardless of the date of purchase, the contractor also owes the\napplicable New York State and local sales and compensating use taxes on the\npurchase of tangible personal property which is brought into or purchased in\n\nNew York State and is incorporated into and becomes part of the capital\nimprovement to real property. Cross-reference:For the general definition of the term\nresident, see section\n526.15\nof\nthis Title. (p) Rental, lease and license to use. (1)\n\nThe\nterms rental, lease and license to use refer to all transactions in which there\nis a transfer of possession of tangible personal property without a transfer of\ntitle to the property. (2)\n\nFor the\npurposes of this Part, when a rental, lease or license to use a vehicle or\nequipment includes the services of a driver or operator, such transaction is\npresumptively the sale of a service, rather than the rental of tangible\npersonal property, where dominion and control over the vehicle or equipment\nremain with the owner or lessor of the vehicle or equipment. Dominion and\ncontrol remain with the owner or lessor of the vehicle or equipment when\npursuant to an agreement or contract the lessor: (i) does not transfer possession, control\nand/or use of the equipment or vehicle to the lessee during the term of the\nagreement or contract; (ii)\nmaintains the right to hire and fire the drivers and operators; (iii)\nuses his own discretion in performing\nthe work (even though the lessee may designate the area where material is to be\npicked up and delivered) and generally selects his own routes; (iv)\nretains responsibility for the operation\nof the equipment or vehicle; and\n(v) directs the work, pays all operating\nexpenses, including drivers' and/or operators' wages, insurance, tolls and\nfuels. Whether a transaction is a sale (license to use, rental or\nlease) of a vehicle or equipment or is the sale of a service, such as a\ntransportation service, must be determined in accordance with the facts and\ncircumstances of the particular transaction and provisions of the agreement\nbetween the contractor and his customer. Example 6:A company enters into an agreement to lease a\ncrane, together with the services of the operator of the crane. The operator\nwill take instructions from the company's foreman, and the company determines\nthe working hours and locations. The operator's wages are separately stated. This transaction is within the definition of sale, as the transfer of\npossession has occurred by reason of the company foreman's right to direct and\ncontrol the operator's use of the equipment. The separately stated operator's\nwages are excludable from the taxable receipts.
