  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-5.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For protection\nagainst loss or damage to local agency property occupied or used by a tenant\nand discovered upon the vacating of the unit by the tenant, and to insure the\npayment of rent which may be due at that time, local agencies may require\ntenants to pay an amount, known as a security deposit, in advance of and as a\ncondition to occupancy. This amount is in addition to and is normally paid in\nadvance of occupancy simultaneously with the first month's rent. Security\ndeposits are held by the local agency until the termination of the tenancy when\ndeduction is made of any amount that may remain due from the tenant and the\nbalance is refunded. Under the law of the State of New York, security deposits\nare made trust funds. Their misapplication is a serious matter and can involve\ncriminal as well as civil penalties. (b) The following general rules should be\nstrictly adhered to: (1)\n\nSecurity deposits\nshould be segregated in a separate interest bearing bank account, and each\nperson making such advance shall be notified in writing as to name and address\nof such banking organization, and amount of deposit. Security deposits are to\nbe held in such account, undisturbed until tenant vacates, and may not be\napplied to loss or damage to local agency property in the interim. The local\nagency should compensate itself for such interim losses and damages by\ncharging, and collecting from, the tenants currently, and not by applying the\nsecurity deposits. (2)\n\nThe security\ndeposit, plus interest, but less any deductions for rent due, loss or damage to\nproperty, or other charges, shall be returned to the tenant as soon as possible\nafter the apartment is vacated. (3)\n\nSecurity deposit refunds are to be mailed to a forwarding address after the\nvacated apartment has been inspected and rented. The new address of the vacated\ntenant is to be recorded on the ledger card of the vacated tenant. In addition, a statement shall be mailed to the former tenant indicating all charges and\ncredits to his account. (4)\n\nSecurity deposit refund checks are not to be cashed from project funds under\nany circumstances. (5)\n\nUnclaimed\nsecurity deposits should be kept open at least six years from date tenant\nvacates premises. (6)\n\nThe housing\nproject shall be entitled to receive for administration expenses, the sum of\none percent per annum of the security money so deposited. The balance of the\ninterest credited by the banking organization shall be annually paid to the\nperson making the deposit of security money. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
