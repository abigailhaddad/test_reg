  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 32.6 - Combined group composition\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following steps should be used to determine whether a\ncombined return is required and, if so, which corporations are included in that\ncombined return: (a) Step 1. Every\ntaxpayer must identify all of the corporations to which it is related, regardless of the franchise tax imposed by the Tax Law the corporation is\nsubject to (or would be taxable under if subject to tax). Where one or more of\nthe related corporations are taxpayers, identify all of the corporations\nrelated to these taxpayers. Do this until all related corporations have been\nidentified. If a taxpayer has no related corporations, it must file on a\nseparate basis. This constitutes the step 1 group of related\ncorporations. (b) Step 2. Identify\nall of the related corporations that have substantial intercorporate\ntransactions with a taxpayer identified in step 1. These related corporations\nand the taxpayer with which they have substantial intercorporate transactions\nconstitute the step 2 tentative combined group. (c) Step 3. Add to the step 2 tentative\ncombined group every related corporation that has substantial intercorporate\ntransactions with any corporation identified in step 2. This constitutes the\nstep 3 tentative combined group. (d) Step 4. Add to the step 3 tentative\ncombined group every related corporation that has substantial intercorporate\ntransactions with any corporation identified in step 3. Repeat this process\nuntil it adds no more corporations to the group. This constitutes the step 4\ntentative combined group. (e) Step\n5. Identify each related corporation not in the step 4 tentative combined group\nthat has substantial intercorporate transactions with another related\ncorporation not in the step 4 tentative combined group. Compare all such groups\nand combine into one group those with common members (unattached related\ngroup). There may be more than one unattached related group. (f) Step 6. If there are substantial\nintercorporate transactions between any one corporation in an unattached\nrelated group and the step 4 tentative combined group, then all corporations in\nthat unattached related group are included in the combined group. Do this for\neach unattached related group. As unattached related groups are included in the\ncombined group, do this analysis between the expanded group and each unattached\nrelated group. The resulting group is the step 6 tentative combined\ngroup. (g) Step 7. If there are\nsubstantial intercorporate transactions between any one corporation in the step\n6 tentative combined group and an unattached related group, then all\ncorporations in the unattached related group are included in the combined\ngroup. Do this for each unattached related group. As unattached related groups\nare included in the combined group, do this analysis between the expanded group\nand each unattached related group. The resulting group is the step 7 tentative\ncombined group. (h) Step 8. Add to\nthe step 7 tentative combined group each related corporation that has\nsubstantial intercorporate transactions with the step 7 tentative combined\ngroup. (i) Step 9. Repeat the\nprocess set forth in steps 4, 6, 7, and 8 until no more corporations can be\nadded to the tentative combined group. (j) Step 10. Eliminate from the tentative\ncombined group those corporations that are formed under the laws of another\ncountry (alien corporations), that are taxable under another franchise tax\nimposed by the Tax Law (or would be taxable under another franchise tax if\nsubject to tax), or that are subject to the tax imposed by section 1502-a or\nsection 1502-b. Also eliminate any captive REIT or captive RIC as defined in\nsubdivisions 9 and 10 of section 2, respectively, that is required to be\nincluded in a combined return under section 210-C. If two or more corporations\nare eliminated, it is possible that they will constitute a combined group if\nthey have substantial intercorporate transactions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
