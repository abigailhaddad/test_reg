  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 55-2.7 - Laboratory on-site assessments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An environmental laboratory seeking or holding a certificate of approval under this Part shall, as a condition of approval, permit on-site assessments to be conducted by the department or by a State program recognized by the department pursuant to section\n55-2.9\nof this Subpart during the laboratory's normal business hours. (b) The factors to be considered during on-site assessments shall include, but not be limited to, the competence and qualifications of staff, adequacy of facilities and equipment, appropriateness of sampling protocols, use of approved methods, and the laboratory's quality system, including, but not limited to, quality assurance and quality control procedures, and recordkeeping and reporting practices, as specified in this Subpart. (c) Each environmental laboratory shall, following each on-site assessment, be furnished with an assessment report which shall set forth the findings of the on-site assessment and any deficiencies to be corrected. (d) Environmental laboratories located outside of the State of New York shall be assessed the approval fee specified in Subpart 55-3 of this Part, as well as additional expenses incurred by the department in conducting on-site assessments of each laboratory. Such on-site assessments shall not be performed before the department receives payment for such additional costs. (e) If deficiencies are found during an on-site assessment, the environmental laboratory may be granted a grace period not to exceed 90 calendar days from the date of notification to correct the deficiencies, provided that, within 30 calendar days of such notification, the laboratory submits to the department or recognized State program performing the assessment a written plan of correction to be implemented within 90 calendar days. If, at the end of the grace period, any of the deficiencies found remain uncorrected, the certificate of approval shall be revoked in affected analytes and/or categories pursuant to section 55- 2.6 of this Subpart. If the deficiencies found do not necessarily or immediately affect either the accuracy or reliability of results, and if the environmental laboratory demonstrates in writing that corrections of deficiencies have been delayed for reasons beyond its control, the grace period granted pursuant to this subdivision may be extended further for a period not to exceed 90 calendar days. Such extension may not be renewed further. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n55-2.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
