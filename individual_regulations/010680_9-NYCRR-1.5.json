Tit. 9 § 1.5 - Executive order no. 5: recommending special procedures to be followed by parole board in all cases involving individuals convicted of murder or of sex crimes\n\nState Regulations\nTO: Chairman of the Board of Parole\n\nCommissioner of Correction\n\nCommissioner of Mental Hygiene\n\nTragic events in the course of the past month involving a\nrecently paroled inmate have focused public attention upon important matters of\ncorrection and parole to which you and your associates have given earnest and\ncontinuing consideration. These events have emphasized the special difficulties\nfaced by the Parole Board in reaching sound determination in cases involving\nprisoners who have been convicted of homicides or of serious sex offenses. In\nsuch cases, insight into the individual's personality is of particular\nimportance and the need for safeguarding the public looms very large. The Parole Board has furnished me with a report as to the\ncircumstances surrounding the release on parole of the inmate involved in this\nrecent crime and has made available to my Counsel and his staff for their\ninspection the records relating to this case. Consultation with the entire membership of the Parole Board\nand with representatives of the Department of Correction and the Department of\n\nMental Hygiene and a review of these materials from the Parole Board indicate\nthat there are certain specific ways in which parole procedures for cases where\nthe safety of the public is necessarily of such concern can be further\nsignificantly strengthened. I am accordingly making the following\nrecommendations to the Parole Board and directing by this Executive Order that\nthe following administrative action be taken to permit the Parole Board to\nadapt its procedures to effect by recommendations: A. Recommendations to the Parole Board\n1. A special procedure should be followed by\nthe Parole Board in all cases involving individuals who have been convicted of\nmurder or of sex crimes in which indeterminate life sentences have been imposed\nand in cases where the individual has been committed to Dannemora State\n\nHospital during the term of his sentence. 2. Under this procedure the Parole Board\nwould obtain special psychiatric reports to be made under the supervision of\nthe Department of Mental Hygiene upon prospective parolees in the above group\nand in such other special cases as the Parole Board may determine. 3. The Parole Board would withhold its final\ndetermination until it receives and considers such special psychiatric\nreports. 4. The ultimate decision\non whether or not to parole would still lie exclusively with the Parole Board, but in reaching its decision the Board would have available to it the\nadditional insight of such special professional reports. B. Administrative Action\n1. Establishing special psychiatric\nprocedures\n\nThe Department of Mental Hygiene shall promptly provide\nappropriate staff to establish special psychiatric procedures for examining\nprospective parolees at the Sing Sing State Prison in Ossining, New York, and\nat the Attica State Prison in Attica, New York. The Department of Correction shall transfer from any of the\nother correctional institutions in the State and make available for the special\npsychiatric examinations at the two institutions the prospective parolees\ndesignated by the Parole Board. 2. The Department of Correction and the\n\nParole Board shall strengthen and extend the \"service unit\" program in the\ncorrectional institutions as rapidly as qualified staff can be recruited, thereby providing additional guidance, counselling and related services and\nstrengthening the work done in preparing comprehensive evaluations of inmates\nfor the use of the Parole Board.
