  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 805.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases herein after\nmentioned shall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In table I, an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters Index Number as appearing in table\nI shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been assigned to any\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof for the purpose of\nidentification. (1)\n\nThe numbering or index\nsystem used to identify specific waters of New York State was adapted from that\nused by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological survey\nseries of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a drainage\nbasin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name or an\nabbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Black River watershed and has been closely followed in connection with the\nidentification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of the stream\nnumbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams originally\nshown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the time of its\nsurvey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few\nstreams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the newer maps are\ndesignated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Black River Drainage Basin may be illustrated\nas follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\n0\n\nLake Ontario\n\nPrimary waters. 0-19\n\nBlack River\n\nThe 19th tributary entering Lake Ontario numbering\nclockwise from the mouth at Tibbetts Point. 0-19-31\n\nDeer River\n\nThe 31st tributary entering Black River upstream\nfrom its mouth. 0-19-31-32\n\nEdick or Parker Creek\n\nThe 32nd tributary entering Deer River upstream\nfrom its mouth. 0-19-31-32-2 and tribs. Mulligan Creek\n\nThe 2nd tributary entering Edick or Parker Creek\nupstream from its mouth. 0-19-31-32-P 403\n\nParker Pond\n\nThe 403rd pond, lake or reservoir encountered in\nthe biological survey area of the Black River watershed and specifically\nlocated in the drainage basin of Edick or Parker Creek. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries, respectively shall mean any\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or\nsubtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include\nonly the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water referenced by such\nwaters index number; where tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned after\nthe waters index number, the specifically designated waters shall include the\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water referenced by such waters\nindex numbers and all tributaries and subtributaries thereof, which are shown\non the reference maps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically designated\nwaters are generally known and which may appear on the reference maps. In cases\nof specifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to\nwhich the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I shall mean a brief\nindication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries\nmay include designations of sections of waters to which a particular assignment\nof a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also include any useful\ninformation pertinent to the classification and standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as\nappearing in table I means map reference number and indicates one or more of\nthe following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on which\nthe specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown. The\nfollowing maps were produced from original maps which may be procured through\nthe Washington Distribution Section, Geological Survey. Map Ref.

(h) Standards\nas appearing\nin table I, and denoted by the letters AA, A, B, C or D opposite each\nspecifically designated waters shall mean the standards of quality and purity\nestablished for class AA, A, B, C or D, as the case may be, as set forth in\n\nPart 701, supra. The symbol (T) appearing after any standard\ndesignation shall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and that the\ndissolved oxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol\n(TS) after any standard designation shall mean that the designated waters are\nsuitable for trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen specification for\ntrout spawning waters shall apply thereto. (i) The term\ntrout\nas used\nin this Part means any fish in the following genera: \"Coregonus\", \"Oncorhynchus\", \"Prosopium\", \"Salmo\", \"Salvelinus\" and \"Thymallus\". (j) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich appear as lines to indicate natural waters on the reference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated in table I, shall be assigned the\nsame classes and standards of quality and purity as the specifically designated\nwaters to which they are directly tributary. (k) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standards as the waters to which it is\ndirectly tributary. (l) The Black\n\nRiver Drainage Basin shall be deemed to include the following areas: All land\nand water area, the natural surface water drainage from which is directly or\nindirectly tributary to the Black River. (m) Notwithstanding, the items indicated in\ntable I and the aforementioned special conditions statements which, in some\ninstances, may indicate assignment of classifications for waters contained\nwithin the boundaries of the State-owned forest preserve lands and, therefore, controlled under the provisions of the State Constitution and the Environmental\n\nConservation Law, such waters are hereby excluded from classification to the\nextent that any part of such waters may be located within the boundaries of the\n\nState-owned forest preserve lands. All waters within 100 feet of the boundaries\nof the State-owned forest preserve lands are hereby assigned to Class A with\nstandards of quality and purity for Class A. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
