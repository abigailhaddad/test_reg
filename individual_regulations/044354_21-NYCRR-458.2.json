(e) Effective date. The standards specified herein shall be effective on and\nafter September 1, 1981 as a precondition for the expansion of existing\nelectric service for the purpose of providing electric heat to all existing\nbuildings and to existing mobile homes not subject to HUD \"Mobile Home\n\nConstruction and Safety Standards\". (f) Relationship to other\nstandards. The requirements imposed by these standards represent the\nminimum standards for existing buildings and mobile homes for which utilities\nmay provide electric service. However, some utilities may require a greater\ndegree of thermal protection than these standards impose. These standards, are\nnot intended to supersede more stringent municipal requirements or standards\nnor are they intended in any way to contravene the State Energy Conservation\n\nConstruction Code Act. The thermal protection for mobile homes is controlled by\nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development \"Mobile Home Construction and\n\nSafety Standards\". In accordance with the Housing and Community Development Act\nof 1974, Title VI (cited as the National Mobile Home Construction and Safety\n\nStandards Act of 1974), the Federal standards take precedence over all State or\nlocal standards. (g) Certificate of compliance. A form of certificate of compliance, included as Appendix\n10-B of this Title, shall be provided to the builder or contractor when the\nbuilder/contractor first contacts the utility concerning electrical service for\nconversion to electric heat of existing buildings or of existing mobile homes\ncovered by these standards. The applicable form shall be completed before the\nutility supplies permanent new or expanded electric service. In addition, an\ninspection of the premises by an employee of the municipal electric department, building code enforcement inspector, or qualified representative of the\nmunicipal government is required to verify compliance with these\nstandards.
