  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 622.7 - Disclosure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Scope.'\n(1)\n\nExcept as noted below, the scope of\ndisclosure is as broad as the scope of disclosure under CPLR Article 31. (2)\n\nPotentially relevant\nelectronically stored information (ESI). (i) Unless authorized by the ALJ, disclosure of ESI is limited to active data\nonly. (ii)\n\nUpon motion of any party\ndemonstrating substantial prejudice, the ALJ may order additional disclosure of\npotentially relevant ESI, subject to any terms and conditions deemed\nappropriate by the ALJ. Such a motion must be accompanied by an affirmation of\nan attorney, or an affidavit of the moving party if not represented by an\nattorney, describing the good faith efforts to resolve the dispute without\nresort to a motion. (b) 'Disclosure devices.'\n(1)\n\nExcept as noted below, the parties may\nemploy any disclosure device contained in CPLR Article 31. Where production and\ninspection of documents is sought, the requested documents must be furnished\nwithin twenty (20) days of receipt of the disclosure demand unless a motion for\na protective order is made. (2)\n\nDepositions and written interrogatories will only be allowed by permission of\nthe ALJ upon a finding that they are likely to expedite the\nproceeding. (3)\n\nBills of\nparticulars are not permitted. (c) 'Protective order and motion to compel.'\n(1)\nA party against whom disclosure is\ndemanded may make a motion to the ALJ for a protective order, in general\nconformance with CPLR 3103, to deny, limit, condition or regulate the use of\nany disclosure device in order to prevent unreasonable annoyance, expense, embarrassment, disadvantage, or other prejudice. Such a motion must be filed\nwithin twenty (20) days of the receipt of the disclosure demand and must be\naccompanied by an affirmation of an attorney, or an affidavit of the moving\nparty if not represented by an attorney, describing the good faith efforts to\nresolve the dispute without resort to a motion. (2)\n\nIf a party fails to comply with a\ndisclosure demand without having made a timely objection, the proponent of the\ndisclosure demand may make a motion to the ALJ to compel disclosure. Such a\nmotion must be accompanied by an affirmation of an attorney, or an affidavit of\nthe moving party if not represented by an attorney, describing the good faith\nefforts to resolve the dispute without resort to a motion. (3)\n\nSanctions. Upon failure by a party to\ncomply with a ruling or order by the ALJ or the commissioner to produce\nmaterial or information demanded in disclosure, the ALJ or commissioner may\nexclude the material or information. In addition, the ALJ or the commissioner\nmay draw an adverse inference regarding the non-producing party with respect to\nthe material or information the party did not produce or grant other\nappropriate relief consistent with CPLR 3126. The award of attorneys' fees or\nother costs is not authorized. (d) 'Subpoenas.' Consistent with the CPLR, any attorney of record in a proceeding has the power to issue subpoenas. A\nparty not represented by an attorney admitted to practice in New York may\nrequest the ALJ or, if no ALJ has been assigned to the proceeding, the Chief\nALJ, to issue a subpoena, stating the items or witnesses needed by the party to\npresent its case. The service of a subpoena is the responsibility of its\nsponsor. This Part does not affect the authority of an attorney of record for\nany party to issue subpoenas under CPLR 2302, except that all subpoenas must\ngive notice that the ALJ may quash or modify the subpoena pursuant to the\nstandards set forth under CPLR Article 23. A subpoena duces tecum to be served\nupon a library, other department or bureau of a municipal corporation or of the\n\nState, or an officer thereof, requiring the production of any books, papers or\nother things, may be issued consistent with CPLR 2307 by the ALJ assigned to\nthe proceeding or, if no ALJ has been assigned to the proceeding, the Chief\nALJ. (e) When department staff\nseeks the revocation of a permit previously granted by the department, either\nparty must, upon demand, and at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing, disclose the evidence that the party intends to introduce at the hearing, including documentary evidence and identification of witnesses; provided, however, the provisions of this subdivision do not require the disclosure of\ninformation or material otherwise protected by law from disclosure, including\ninformation and material protected because of privilege or confidentiality. If, after the disclosure, a party determines to rely upon other witnesses or\ndocumentary evidence, the party must, as soon as practicable, supplement its\ndisclosure by providing the names of the witnesses or the documentary\nevidence.
