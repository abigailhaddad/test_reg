  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 5020.1 - Standard for determining disability retirement for members who last joined the system prior to July 27, 1976, and who meet the eligibility requirements of section 511 of the Education Law\n\nState Regulations\n\nIt must be determined that the member is totally and\npermanently disabled and was so disabled at the time the member ceased\nperformance of duties. To be deemed totally disabled, it must be concluded that\nthe member is unable to perform all the substantial and material acts necessary\nto the prosecution of teaching duties in a customary and usual manner. To be\ndeemed permanently disabled, the condition must be such to justify a deduction\nthat any recovery by the member is far removed in the future and that the end\nof the disability cannot be foreseen for at least one year. In addition, total\ndisability is not permanent if, during the period for which recovery is sought\nor at any time thereafter, the member may alleviate or control the condition by\navailing himself of a standard treatment which is not inherently dangerous. The\nmember shall have the burden of establishing all of the foregoing to the\nsatisfaction of the Retirement Board. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n5020.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
