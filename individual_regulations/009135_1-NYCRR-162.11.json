New York State Seal of Quality grade of cheddar, washed curd or colby\ncheese, shall be according to the degree of curing on the basis of rating (A)\nflavor, (B) body and texture, (C) color, (D) finish and appearance. The rating\nof each quality factor shall be established on the basis of characteristics\npresent in cheese from any sample. The final grade shall be established on the\nbasis of the lowest rating of any one of the quality characteristics. Seal of\n\nQuality cheddar cheese conform to the following requirements and standards: (1)\n\nFlavor. Shall possess desirable and\npleasing flavor and odor characteristics. Commensurate with its age and degree\nof cure, it may possess feed, acid, bitter, fruity and sulfide types of flavors\nto a degree detectable only upon critical examination. Fresh or uncured cheese\nof this grade shall not possess bitter, fruity, sulfide, utensil, yeasty or\nforeign flavors to any degree. (2)\n\nBody and texture. Cheddar cheese of this grade shall be reasonably firm bodied\nand smooth textured. A sample drawn for inspection shall be reasonably close, with no large, connecting or ragged openings, and shall be practically free of\ngas holes and may be detectably slit but not intense. (i) Commensurate with its age and degree of\ncure, when cheese of this grade is worked, it shall break down to a cohesive, waxy or semi-glossy consistency and shall be free of pronounced rough, grain-like or mealy appearance which is associated with excessive\nacid. (ii)\n\nWashed curd cheese of\nthis grade shall conform to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph except that it\nmay be definitely open and less firm bodied. (iii)\n\nColby cheese of this grade shall\nconform to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph except that it shall have\nnumerous small mechanical openings distributed throughout the cheese. (iv)\n\nWhen triers are used to draw samples, plugs shall be full and unbroken. (3)\n\nColor. May be colored or uncolored, but\nif colored, it shall be uniform throughout. May possess numerous tiny white\nspecks, associated with aged cheese. May possess seaminess and waviness to a\nslight degree. (4)\n\nFinish and\nappearance. (i) Bandaged and paraffin-dipped. The rind shall be sound, firm and smooth, providing a good protection to the\ncheese. The bandage may be slightly uneven, overlapped or wrinkled, but not\nburst or torn. The surface shall be practically smooth, bright and have good\ncoating of paraffin or wax that adheres firmly to all surfaces of the cheese, with certain allowable tolerances for mold and other defects according to the\ndegree of curing. There shall be no indication that mold has entered the\ncheese. It shall be free from huffing, but may have slightly high edges and be\nslightly lopsided. (ii)\n\nRindless. The wrapper or covering shall adequately and securely envelop the cheese, be\nneat, unbroken and fully protect the surface but may be slightly wrinkled. The\ncheese shall be free from huffing but may be slightly lopsided and may have\nvery slight mold under the wrapper or covering in medium and cured\nclassifications. There shall be no indications that mold has entered the\ncheese. (b) Flavor. (1)\n\nSlight. Detected only upon\ncritical examination. (2)\n\nDefinite. Not intense but detectable. (3)\n\nPronounced.

(c) Body and texture. (1)\n\nSmooth. Feels silky; not dry and coarse\nor rough. (2)\n\nReasonably firm. Somewhat less firm but not to the extent of materially injuring the keeping\nquality of the cheese. (3)\n\nOpen.
