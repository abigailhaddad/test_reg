Tit. 1 § 2.50 - Bottling and packaging-item 18p\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All milk and milk products, including\nconcentrated milk and milk products, are bottled and packaged at the plant\nwhere final pasteurization is performed, provided that this requirement shall\nnot apply to frozen desserts. Such bottling and packaging shall be done without\nundue delay following final pasteurization. (b) All bottling or packaging is done on\napproved mechanical equipment. The term approved mechanical equipment shall not\nbe interpreted to exclude manually operated machinery but is interpreted to\nexclude methods in which the bottling and capping devices are not integral in\none system. (c) Bottling or\npackaging machines are designed to minimize the need for adjustment during\noperation. All pipes, connections, defoaming devices and similar appurtenances\nshall comply with sections\n2.38\nand\n2.39\nof this Part (Items 10p and\n11p). (d) Bottling or packaging\nmachine supply tanks and bowls have covers which are constructed to prevent any\ncontamination from reaching the inside of the filler tank or bowl. All covers\nshall be in place during operation. (e) A drip deflector is installed on each\nfiller valve. Such drip deflector shall be designed and adjusted to divert\ncondensation away from the open container. (f) Container infeed conveyors to automatic\nbottling or packaging machines have overhead shields to protect the bottles or\npackages from contamination. Such shields shall extend from the bottle washer\ndischarge to the bottle feed star or, in the case of single-service packaging\nmachines, from the forming unit discharge to the filling unit and from the\nfilling unit to the closure unit. Overhead shields shall be required on can\ninfeed conveyors when the cans are fed to the filler with covers off. (g) Container fabricating materials, such as\npaper stock, foil, wax, plastic, etc., are handled in a sanitary manner and\nprotected against undue exposure during the package assembly\noperation. (h) Bottling and\npackaging machine floats are designed to be adjustable without removing the\ncover. (i) The filler pipe of all\nbottling and packaging machines have an apron or other approved device as close\nto the filler bowl as possible to prevent condensation or drip from reaching\nthe inside of the filler bowl. (j) Filling cylinders on packaging machines are protected from contamination by the\nuse of overhead shields. When any lubricant is applied to the filler pistons, cylinders or other milk-contact surfaces, the lubricant shall be nontoxic, sterile, and shall be sparingly applied in a sanitary manner. (k) Milk and milk products from continuous\ndefoamers are not returned directly to the filler bowl. (l) Butter liners, before use, are completely\nimmersed in a salt solution in a non-corrosive container for not less than 30\nminutes at the boiling point and held in this solution until used. At least 15\npounds of salt shall be used for every 100 pounds of solution, and the solution\nshall be changed frequently to keep it clean. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n2.50\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
