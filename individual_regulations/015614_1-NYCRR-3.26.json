  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 3.26 - Pasteurizers employing product-to-product regenerative heating-item 16p(b)\n\nState Regulations\n\nPasteurizers employing product-to-product regenerative\nheating with both sides closed to the atmosphere shall comply with the\nfollowing: (a) Regenerators shall be\nconstructed, installed and operated so that at all times the pasteurized\nproduct in the regenerator will automatically be under greater pressure than\nthe raw product in the regenerator. (b) The pasteurized product, between its\noutlet from the regenerator and the nearest point downstream open to the\natmosphere, shall rise to a vertical elevation of 12 inches above the highest\nraw product level downstream from the constant-level tank, and shall be open to\nthe atmosphere at this or a higher elevation. (c) The overflow of the top rim of the\nconstant-level raw product tank shall always be lower than the lowest product\nlevel in the regenerator. (d) No\npump or flow-promoting device which can affect the proper pressure\nrelationships within the regenerator shall be located between the pasteurized\nproduct outlet from the regenerator and the nearest downstream point open to\nthe atmosphere. (e) No pump shall\nbe located between the raw product inlet to the regenerator and the raw product\nsupply tank unless it is designed and installed to operate ony when the product\nis flowing through the pasteurized product side of the regenerator and the\npressure of the pasteurized product is higher than the maximum pressure\nproduced by the pump. This may be accomplished by wiring the booster pump so\nthat it cannot operate unless: (1)\nthe\nmetering pump is in operation; (2)\nthe flow-diversion device is in forward-flow position; and\n(3)\nthe pasteurized product pressure exceeds, by at least 1 psi, the maximum pressure developed by the booster pump. Pressure gauges shall be installed at the raw product\ninlet to the regenerator and at the pasteurized product outlet of the\nregenerator or the outlet of the cooler. The accuracy of required pressure\ngauges shall be checked by the regulatory agency upon installation, quarterly\nthereafter, and following any repair or adjustment. (f) The motor, casing and impeller\nof the booster pump shall be identified and a record of that information\nmaintained as directed by the regulatory agency. All electric wiring shall be\nin permanent conduit except that rubber-covered cable may be used for final\nconnections. (g) All raw product in\nthe regenerator shall drain freely into the constant-level raw product tank\nwhen the raw product pump(s) are shut down and the raw product outlet from the\nregenerator is disconnected. (h) When vacuum equipment is located downstream from the flow-diversion device, means shall be provided to prevent the lowering of the pasteurized product\nlevel in the regenerator during periods of diverted flow or shutdown. An\neffective vacuum breaker and an automatic means of preventing a negative\npressure shall be installed in the line between the vacuum chamber and the\npasteurized product inlet to the regenerator. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n3.26\n\nSee Appendix 3 of this Title for further discussion\nconcerning methods of achieving the required pressure relationships within the\nregenerator. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
