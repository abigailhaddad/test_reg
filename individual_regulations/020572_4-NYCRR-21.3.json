Tit. 4 § 21.3 - Sick leave\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Sick leave\nis absence with pay necessitated by the illness or disability of the employee\nincluding illness or disability caused by pregnancy or childbirth. (b) Employees shall earn sick leave credits\nat the rate of one-half day per biweekly pay period and may accumulate such\ncredits up to a total of 150 days; provided, however, that an employee shall\nnot earn sick leave credit for any biweekly pay period unless he is in full pay\nstatus for at least seven work days during such biweekly pay period. A\npart-time employee who is required to work a fixed number of hours, five days\nper week, shall also earn sick leave credit as provided herein, but his total\npay when absent on such leave shall be the amount which would have been due him\nhad he been working regularly at his usual hours for such period. (c) An employee absent on sick leave shall\nnotify his supervisor of such absence and the reason therefor on the first day\nof such absence and within two hours after the beginning of his work day; provided, however, that where the work is such that a substitute may be\nrequired, the appointing authority may require earlier notification, but not\nmore than two hours prior to the beginning of the employee's work day. Sick\nleave credits may be used in such units as the appointing authority may\napprove, but shall not be used in units of less than one-half hour. (d) Before absence for personal illness may\nbe charged against accumulated sick leave credits, the appointing authority may\nrequire such proof of illness as may be satisfactory to it, or may require the\nemployee to be examined, at the expense of the department or agency, by a\nphysician designated by the appointing authority. In the event of failure to\nsubmit proof of illness upon request, or in the event that, upon such proof as\nis submitted or upon the report of medical examination, the appointing\nauthority finds that there is not satisfactory evidence of illness sufficient\nto justify the employee's absence from the performance of his duties, such\nabsence may be considered as unauthorized leave and shall not be charged\nagainst accumulated sick leave credits. Abuse of sick leave privileges shall be\ncause for disciplinary action. (e) The appointing authority may require an employee who has been absent because of\npersonal illness, prior to and as a condition of his return to duty, to be\nexamined, at the expense of the department or agency, by a physician designated\nby the appointing authority, to establish that he is not disabled from the\nperformance of his normal duties and that his return to duty will not\njeopardize the health of other employees. (f) In addition to personal illness of the\nemployee, the following types of absence, when approved by the appointing\nauthority, may be charged against accumulated sick leave credits: illness or\ndeath in the employee's family, provided, however, that charge for such absence\nshall not exceed a maximum of 15 days in any one year; absence of an employee\ncertified by an examining physician as benefiting from the use of a service\nanimal in performing major life activities, or who is registered with the New\n\nYork State Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped as legally blind, or certified by an examining physician or licensed optometrist as legally\nblind, as manifested by visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with\nbest correction or a visual field of 20 degrees or less, or who has a hearing\nimpairment manifested by a speech discrimination score of 40 percent or less in\nthe better ear with appropriate correction as certified by an examining\nphysician or by a licensed audiologist or otorhinolaryngologist, for the\npurpose of obtaining a guide dog or service animal and required training\nrelated thereto, provided, however, that charge for such absence shall not\nexceed a maximum of 26 days in any one calendar year; and personal visits to\ndoctor or dentist. Proof of the need for such absence, satisfactory to the\nappointing authority, may be required. (g) When an employee is transferred, his\naccumulated sick leave credits shall be transferred with him. When an employee\nis separated from service for other than disciplinary reasons and is\nsubsequently reinstated or reemployed within one year after such separation, or\nis reinstated by action of the State Civil Service Commission, or is reinstated\nor reemployed while eligible for reinstatement from a preferred list, his sick\nleave credits accumulated and unused at the time of his separation shall be\nrestored; provided, however, that such sick leave credits shall not be restored\nexcept where leave records satisfactory to the appointing authority and the\n\nDepartment of Civil Service are available. (h) Every per diem and hourly paid employee\nshall, on the date on which he becomes subject to this Chapter, be credited\nwith the number of days of sick leave which he would have earned during the\npreceding nine months if he had been subject to this Chapter during such\nperiod, less the number of days of sick leave with pay which were granted to\nhim during such nine-month period, except that no deduction shall be made for\nsick leave drawn during such nine-month period which was earned prior thereto\nin accordance with an established departmental policy. (i) This section shall not be construed to\nrequire extension of any employment beyond the time at which it would otherwise\nterminate by operation of law, rule or regulation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
