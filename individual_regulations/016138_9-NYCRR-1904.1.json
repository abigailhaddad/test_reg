  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1904.1 - Regulatory agreements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ncorporation shall enter into a regulatory agreement with each applicant who has\nbeen accepted as a project recipient or local program administrator, provided\nthat the conditions set forth in the award have been satisfied. The regulatory\nagreement shall provide that regulation of the project shall extend over the\ngreater of the period of the grant or loan or for 15 years in the case of\nhomesteading projects, or 20 years in the case of condominium projects, cooperative projects and rental projects, after completion of the construction, rehabilitation or conversion of the project. (b) If the project recipient is a private\ndeveloper, the regulatory agreement shall require the private developer to make\nan equity investment of the greater of: (1)\n2\n1/2 percent of project costs; or\n(2)\n5 percent of project costs less grants\nwhich are to be applied to said costs. The term grants as used in this paragraph shall be\ndeemed to include loans which are not required to be repaid. For the purposes\nof this subdivision, property which is obtained through a governmental program\nor from a governmental unit for a public purpose shall be deemed to have no\nequity value. For the purposes of this subdivision, property owned or acquired\nand contributed to the project shall be deemed to have an equity value of 25\npercent of its preconstruction appraised value. The equity investment is to be\nmade at or prior to the construction loan closing. Equity value may also be\nrecognized for contributions to the acquisition of property which is financed\nin part by a payment, grant or loan made by the corporation. The equity value\nin such case shall also be limited to the 25 percent of the actual investment\nmade by the private developer. The corporation may, in its discretion, consent\nto the establishment of a different equity value if it is necessary to the\nproject. Among the criteria the corporation shall consider in exercising its\ndiscretion are: (i) cost incurred by\nthe owner to acquire the property; (ii)\nthe preconstruction appraised value; and\n(iii)\nthe suitability of the\nproperty for development of low income housing. A private developer is not precluded from making a\ngreater equity investment than that required. (c) The regulatory agreement shall\nprovide that the restrictions on the use of the eligible property are real\ncovenants that shall run with the land until the termination of the regulatory\nperiod or the payment, grant or loan made by the corporation is paid back to\nthe corporation, whichever is later. (d) The local program administrator shall\nenter into a contract with each subrecipient, subject to review as to form by\nthe corporation, which shall include the provisions specified in subdivisions\n(a), (b) and (c) of this section. (e) (1)\n\nThe\ncorporation may provide that where a lender shall have foreclosed or obtained\ntitle to the project in accordance with law and provisions of the mortgage, the\nprojects or particular residential units therein shall not be subject to one or\nmore provisions of the act with the exception of section 1102(3)(g) of the\nact. (2)\n\nThe corporation may not\nmake the provisions referred to in paragraph (1) of this subdivision unless the\ncorporation shall first have found that it is necessary in order to enable a\nproject owner to obtain a mortgage loan from a lender other than the\ncorporation.
