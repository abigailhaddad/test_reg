  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-3.14 - Security deposits ledger\n\nState Regulations\nA separate security deposits ledger arranged by sites, related programs, etc. shall be maintained for each project for the recording\nof security deposits. A separate security deposits ledger card or sheet shall\nbe maintained for each apartment. This card shall be used to record both the\nreceipt of the security deposit, its refund when the tenant vacates and the\nreceipt of the security deposit from the new tenant. A specimen form of a\nsecurity deposits ledger card is shown in Exhibit 10 of Appendix S-8. Each\nsecurity deposits ledger sheet or card shall bear the tenants account number, address of the apartment, date security deposit was received and date refunded, tenants name and amount of the security deposit. The security deposits ledger\nis subsidiary to and shall be controlled by account 2114, Tenants Security\n\nDeposits. Prior to substantial completion, monthly trial balances of the\nsecurity deposits ledger shall be taken, but thereafter the trial balances may\nbe taken quarterly, inasmuch as the security deposits ledger will not\nordinarily be very active once the project has been fully rented. Semiannually\n(as of September 30 and March 31), the total amount determined by multiplying\nthe number of the dwelling units by the amount of the individual security\ndeposit should be compared with the security deposit general ledger balance and\nthe difference, if any, reconciled. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-3.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
