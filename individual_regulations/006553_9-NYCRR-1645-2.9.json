  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-2.9 - Allocation of interest earned to related programs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The allocation of interest earned on\ndevelopment fund investments or State Housing Fund investments is based on the\npresumption that such investments represent, firstly, the investment of\nunexpended funds for the offsite clearance program; secondly, the investment of\nunexpended funds for the rehabilitation program; thirdly, the investment of\nfunds for the relocation of buildings program; and, lastly, the investment of\nunexpended funds other than funds for the specified related programs. If the\ninvestments were made from the proceeds of temporary loan notes, the\ninvestments and the allocation of the interest thereon are related to the\nunexpended balances, at the end of a quarter, of the amounts requisitioned for\nthe respective related programs on the most recent approved certificate of\npurposes. If the investments were made from bond issue proceeds, the\ninvestments and the allocation of the interest earned thereon, are related to\nthe unexpended balances, at the end of a given quarter, of the amounts budgeted\nfor the respective programs on the bond sale budget. (b) To illustrate the operation of the\nallocation of the interest earned credit, as stated above, assume that the\nunexpended balance for the respective programs, at the end of a quarter, are as\nfollows: (1)\n\nOffsite clearance\n$100,000\n(2)\n\nRehabilitation\n35,000\n(3)\n\nRelocation of buildings\n10,000\n$145,000\n\nIf the development fund investments were $150,000, the\ninterest earned during the quarter on $100,000 would be credited to offsite\nclearance, on $35,000 to rehabilitation, on $10,000 to relocation of buildings, and the interest on the residual amount of $5,000 would remain as a credit to\nproject development cost (account 1420.2) or project income (account 3610). If\nthe development fund investments were $125,000, the interest earned during the\nquarter on $100,000 would be credited to offsite clearance and that on $25,000\nto rehabilitation, with no credit to relocation of buildings or project\ndevelopment cost (account 1420.2) or project income (account 3610). If the\ndevelopment fund investments were $15,000, the entire credit for the interest\nearned during the quarter would be to offsite clearance. (c) The interest earned on development fund\ninvestments or State Housing Fund investments shall be credited, in the first\ninstance, to account 1420.2 Interest Income, or account 3610, Interest Earned, whichever is applicable, and then distributed by journal voucher, as credits to\nthe related programs on the basis of the allocation described above. The cutoff\npoint for the allocation of interest earned to the offsite clearance program\nshall be the date of substantial completion of the project proper, or the date\nof liquidation of the offsite clearance program, whichever is earlier. The\ncutoff point for the allocation of interest earned to the rehabilitation or\nrelocation of buildings programs shall be the dates of liquidation of the\nrespective programs. Where State Housing Fund investments and development fund\ninvestments both represent bond issue proceeds, the interest earned on the\n\nState Housing Fund investments should be allocated first in accordance with the\nbond sale budget amounts unexpended to date. If the bond sale budget amounts\nfor the related programs are in excess of the State Housing Fund investments, allocable thereto, then the interest earned on the development fund investments\nis allocated to the extent necessary to make up the deficiency.
