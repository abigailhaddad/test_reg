  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 346.11 - Article 52 executions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Enforcement of orders and judgments by\nexecution. (1)\n\nSupport arrears/past due\nsupport for child support or combined spousal and child support payable to the\nSCU may be enforced by levy upon the support obligor's liquid assets when the\nsupport obligor is in default as defined in subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding the\nprovisions of this section, support arrears/past due support which have been\nreduced to judgment may be enforced pursuant to this section without affording\nthe support obligor the opportunity to assert a mistake of fact pursuant to the\nprocedures established in subdivision (e) of this section and are not\nrestricted to execution upon the support obligor's liquid assets. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nDefault. For purposes of this section, a\nsupport obligor is in default if he or she has failed to remit to the SCU the\naccumulation of an amount equal to or greater than the amount directed by court\norder to be paid for two months. For purposes of this section only, a default\nmay not be founded upon the existence of retroactive support; however, if a\nsupport obligor defaults subsequent to the date of the court order, retroactive\nsupport may be collected pursuant to the provisions of this section. Any\narrears or retroactive support collected pursuant to this section need not be\nreduced to judgment. A support obligor may assert a mistake of fact pursuant to\nthe procedures established in subdivision (e) of this section prior to the\nSCU's seizure of the support obligor's assets. (2)\n\nLiquid assets. Liquid assets are cash or\nassets which are immediately convertible to cash including, but not limited to, debts owed to the support obligor and bank accounts to which the support\nobligor holds title, unless they are exempt from application to the\nsatisfaction of a judgment pursuant to any provision of law. (c) Financial investigation of\nliquid assets. The SCU must obtain and investigate information relating to\nliquid assets that belong to a support obligor which may be seized to enforce\nsupport arrears/past due support pursuant to this section. Information from\n\nFederal and State tax information concerning such liquid assets must be\nreviewed by the SCU, independently verified by the SCU, and must be safeguarded\nby the SCU in accordance with Federal and State regulations. In addition, such\ninformation must be independently verified and documented as such on the child\nsupport management system (CSMS) prior to proceeding under paragraph (d)(7) of\nthis section. (d) Procedure. Support arrears/past due support may be enforced by levy upon a support\nobligor's property when the support obligor is in default, as follows: (1)\n\nIssuance of restraining notice and\ninformation subpoena. For any support obligor in default as defined in\nsubdivision (b) of this section, the SCU must issue a restraining notice to the\ncustodian of the property sought to be executed upon, provided, however, that\nthe SCU must verify the amount of support arrears/past due support owed by the\nsupport obligor and must verify the support obligor's current address prior to\nthe issuance of the restraining notice. The identity of the garnishee must be\nconsistent with those requirements specified in section\n5201\nof the Civil Practice Law and Rules. However, when the SCU determines that the prospective garnishee is the employer\nof the support obligor and the property sought to be restrained consists of\nwages or salary due or to become due to the obligor, the SCU must execute upon\nsuch property pursuant to section\n347.9\nof this Title. The\nrestraining notice must include such information as is required by subdivision\n(a) of section\n5222\nof the Civil Practice Law and Rules, and must be accompanied by an information subpoena for the purpose of\nascertaining or verifying information relating to liquid assets which belong to\na support obligor. (2)\n\nEffect of\nrestraining notice. (i) A support obligor\nserved with a restraining notice is forbidden to permit or undertake the sale, assignment, transfer, or interference with the property which is the subject of\nthe restraining notice, except pursuant to court order, until the support\narrears/past due support which gave rise to the restraining notice are\nsatisfied. (ii)\nA restraining\nnotice served upon a person other than the support obligor is effective only\nif, at the time of service, that person owes a debt to the support obligor or\nis in possession of property in which he or she knows or has reason to believe\nthe support obligor has an interest, or if the restraining notice states that\nthe support obligor has an interest in the subject property. In addition, any\nproperty in which the support obligor has an interest which thereafter comes\ninto the possession of that person is subject to the restraining notice. Such\nperson is forbidden to permit or undertake the sale, assignment, transfer, or\ninterference with the property which is the subject of the restraining notice, except pursuant to court order, until the expiration of one year after the\nnotice is served upon such person or until the support arrears/past due support\nwhich gave rise to the restraining notice are satisfied, whichever occurs\nfirst. (3)\n\nSubsequent\nrestraining notices. Leave of court is required to serve more than one\nrestraining notice upon the same person with respect to the same support\narrears/past due support which gave rise to the restraining notice. (4)\n\nService of notice on the support obligor. (i) If the restraining notice which has been\nissued pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision has been served on a\nperson other than the support obligor, and if the support obligor has not been\ngiven notice in the form prescribed by subdivision (e) of section\n5222\nof the Civil Practice Law and Rules\nwithin one year before service of the restraining notice, then a copy of the\nrestraining notice together with such notice must be mailed by first class mail\nor personally delivered to the support obligor within four days of service of\nthe restraining notice upon such other person. If mailed, such notice must be\nsent by first class mail to the support obligor at his or her residential\naddress. If the notice is returned as undeliverable, or if the support\nobligor's residential address is unknown, then the notice must be sent by first\nclass mail to the support obligor's place of employment, if known, in an\nenvelope marked \"personal and confidential\" and not indicating that the\ncommunication concerns a support order or judgment. If neither the support\nobligor's residence address nor place of employment is known, then the notice\nmust be sent by first class mail to any other known address. (ii)\n\nAt the time at which such notice is\nserved on the support obligor, the support obligor must also be notified of the\nfollowing: (a) the name and address of the\nSCU which issued the restraining notice; and\n(b) that if the support arrears/past due\nsupport which gave rise to the restraining notice have not been reduced to\njudgment, the support obligor may assert a mistake of fact with respect to the\nSCU's issuance of the restraining notice, as set forth in subdivision (e) of\nthis section, and that such assertion must be made in writing to the SCU within\n15 days from service of the notice on the support obligor. (5)\n\nEnforcement of debt subject to\nmistake of fact determination. If the support obligor asserts a mistake of fact\nas set forth in subdivision (e) of this section, the SCU must determine the\nvalidity of such assertion and provide the support obligor with written notice\nof its determination within 45 days from the date upon which notice was served\nupon the support obligor pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section. If no\nmistake of fact is alleged by the support obligor, or if a determination is\nmade by the SCU that the alleged mistake of fact is without merit, the SCU must\nproceed to execute upon the restrained property in accordance with this\nsubdivision. (6)\n\nVacatur of\nrestraining notice. Prior to executing upon a support obligor's property, the\nSCU must ascertain whether the amount sought to be recovered through the\nexecution has been satisfied through other means or whether a mistake of fact\nclaim has been found to have merit as provided in subdivision (e) of this\nsection. If the amount to be recovered has been satisfied, or if a mistake of\nfact claim has been found to have merit, the SCU must immediately vacate the\nrestraining notice by notifying the custodian of the property sought to be\nexecuted upon. (7)\n\nIssuance of the\nexecution. For any support obligor in default as defined in subdivision (a) of\nthis section who has failed to assert a meritorious mistake of fact, the SCU\nmust execute upon the restrained property in order to satisfy in whole or in\npart the support arrears/past due support that caused the issuance of the\nrestraining notice. (i) If the levy is to be\naccomplished by service of the execution, a copy of the execution must be\nserved upon the garnishee in the same manner as a summons, except that such\nservice cannot be made by delivery to a person authorized to receive service of\nsummons solely by a designation filed pursuant to a provision of law other than\nrule 318 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. In the event the garnishee is the\n\nState of New York, service must be made in the same manner as an income\nexecution pursuant to section\n5231\nof the Civil Practice Law and Rules. The execution must include such information as is required by section\n5230\nof the Civil Practice Law and\n\nRules. (ii)\n\nIf the levy is to be\naccomplished by seizure, the SCU must execute upon the support obligor's\ninterest in personal property capable of delivery by taking the property into\ncustody without interfering with the lawful possession of pledgees and lessees. The SCU must immediately serve a copy of the execution in the manner prescribed\nin subparagraph (i) of this paragraph upon the person from whose possession or\ncustody the property was taken. (8)\n\nEffect of execution by service. (i) The person upon whom the execution is\nserved must immediately transfer all such property, and pay all such debts upon\nmaturity, to the SCU and must execute any document necessary to effect the\ntransfer or payment. After such transfer or payment, property which comes into\nthe possession or custody of such person, or debt incurred by such person, is\nnot subject to the execution. Until such transfer or payment is made, or until\nthe expiration of 90 days after service of the execution, the person served\nmust not allow or undertake the sale, assignment, or transfer of, or\ninterference with, the property which is the subject of the restraining notice, other than to the SCU, except pursuant to court order or the direction of the\nSCU. At the expiration of 90 days after service of the execution, or at such\nfurther time as may be directed by a court upon motion by the SCU, the\nexecution is void except as to such property or debts which have been\ntransferred to the SCU or paid to the SCU. If the property or debts which have\nbeen transferred or paid to the SCU do not fully satisfy the support\narrears/past due support which gave rise to the restraining notice, the SCU\nmust record the amount of the judgment or order unpaid at the time of the\nreturn in accordance with subdivision (f) of this section. (ii)\n\nAn SCU which has specified personal\nproperty or debt to be levied upon in a notice served with an execution is\nliable to the owner of the property or the person to whom the debt is owed, if\nother than the support obligor, for any damages sustained by reason of the\nlevy. (9)\n\nService of\nnotice of the execution on the support obligor. Where an execution does not\nstate that a notice in the form prescribed in paragraph (4) of this subdivision\nhas been served upon the support obligor within a year, the SCU must send by\nfirst class mail or personally deliver to the support obligor a copy of the\nexecution together with such notice no later than four days after service of\nthe execution upon any garnishee. The SCU must specify on the notice to the\nsupport obligor the name and address of the SCU. The notice must be mailed by\nfirst class mail to the support obligor at his or her residential address. If\nthe notice is returned as undeliverable, or if the support obligor's\nresidential address is unknown, then the notice must be sent by first class\nmail to the support obligor's place of employment, if known, in an envelope\nmarked \"personal and confidential\" and not indicating that the communication\nconcerns a debt. If neither the support obligor's residential address nor place\nof employment is known, then the notice must be sent by first class mail to any\nother known address. (e) Mistake of fact. (1)\n\nWhere the SCU has issued\nnotice to a support obligor pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the\nsupport obligor may assert a mistake of fact by making a written submission to\nthe SCU within 15 days from the date upon which such notice was served upon the\nsupport obligor. Such written submission may include such documentary evidence\nas the support obligor believes may support his or her assertion. (i) Defenses which may be asserted by the\nsupport obligor include, but are not limited to, claims that: (a) the person identified as the owner of the\nproperty is not the support obligor who owes the support arrears/past due\nsupport; (b) the court order or\njudgment which gave rise to the support arrears/past due support does not exist\nor has been vacated; or\n(c) the\namount claimed by the SCU to be owed is incorrect because a payment which was\nmade was not credited or the amount of support arrears/past due support was not\ncomputed accurately. (2)\n\nIf a support obligor asserts a mistake of\nfact pursuant to this subdivision, the SCU must determine the merits of the\nassertion and notify the support obligor of its determination within 45 days\nfrom the date upon which notice was served upon the support obligor pursuant to\nparagraph (d)(4) of this section. (3)\n\nIf a support obligor asserts a mistake of\nfact pursuant to this section, and the SCU determines that the assertion is\nwithout merit, the support obligor also must be notified that the execution\nwill be served on the garnishee and of the time at which the execution will\ntake place. (f) Records\nof the SCU. Each SCU must keep a record of executions which have been\nadministered pursuant to this section. Such records must include the names of\nthe parties and the support obligor; the dates of issue and return; the date\nand time of delivery of the levied property; the amount due at the time the\nexecution was delivered; the amount due at the time the execution was\ndelivered; the amount of the support arrears/past due support which were\nsatisfied; and the amount of the judgment or order unpaid at the time of the\nreturn.
