If federally or privately funded programs in a school district require\nmatching with local funds, such district may claim the amount of funds set\naside for compensatory education as local funds, provided that such programs\nare operated in accordance with the provisions of this Subpart. (c) Pupils with compensatory educational\nneeds shall continue to be eligible to receive instructional programs and\nservices as provided in this Subpart until such pupils have achieved grade\nlevel in school subjects and skills in accordance with criteria determined by\nthe commissioner.

(e) Funds set aside for compensatory\neducation may be used only to supplement and, to the extent practicable, increase the level of funds that would, in the absence of such State funds, be\nmade available from other State or local sources for the education of pupils\nwith compensatory educational needs and in no case may such funds be used to\nsupplant funds from other State or local sources. (f) Remedial instruction required pursuant to\nsections\n100.3\n(b)(3), 100.4\n(f), and\n100.5\n(a)(4)(iv)\nof\nthis Title shall continue only so long as Federal funds under chapter 1 of\ntitle I of the ESEA of 1965, as amended are made available to school districts\nin New York.
