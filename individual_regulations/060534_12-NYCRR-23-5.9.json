  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-5.9 - Two-point suspension scaffolds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Width and fastening. Two-point suspension scaffold platforms shall be not less\nthan 20 inches nor more than 32 inches in width. Every such platform shall be\nof sufficient width to properly fit the hangers and shall be securely fastened\nthereto by U-bolts which pass around the hangers or by other equivalent\nmeans. (b) Hangers. The platforms of two-point suspension scaffolds shall\nrest on hangers fabricated of mild steel or wrought iron, each having a\ncross-sectional area capable of sustaining four times the maximum rated load. Such hangers shall be designed with supports for guard rails, intermediate\nrails and toeboards. (c) Roof irons. Roof irons or hooks used in connection with two-point\nsuspension scaffolds shall be constructed of mild steel or wrought iron and\nshall be securely anchored. They shall be provided with tie-backs of at least\nthree-quarters inch manila rope so installed that the tension is at right\nangles to the face of the building or other structure. Where the upper block\nhook does not directly engage the roof iron, the connection shall be made by\nimproved plow steel wire rope not less than one-half inch in diameter. (d) Safety railings and\nscreening. The open sides of two-point suspension scaffolds shall be\nprovided with safety railings constructed and installed in compliance with this\n\nPart (rule). In addition, such safety railings shall be provided with wire mesh\ninstalled from the toeboards to the top railings. Such wire mesh shall be not\nless than No. 18 U.S. gage steel with openings that will reject a one-inch\ndiameter ball. (e) Use of two-point suspension scaffolds. (1)\n\nTwo or more such scaffolds shall not be\ncombined into one by bridging the distance between them. Persons shall not pass\nfrom one two-point suspension scaffold to another. Not more than two persons\nshall be permitted to work on any two-point suspension scaffold at one time\nunless such scaffold is specially approved and such use is stated in such\napproval. (2)\n\nEvery person located\non any two-point suspension scaffold shall be provided with and shall be\nrequired to use an approved safety belt or harness together with a separate\nhanging lifeline in compliance with this Part (rule). (f) Suspension ropes. (1)\n\nWhen hoisting machines are used for any\ntwo-point suspension scaffold, the wire rope shall be at least five-sixteenths\ninch in diameter and capable of supporting at least six times the intended\nload. (2)\n\nAll fibre rope used for\ntwo-point suspension scaffolds shall be at least equivalent in strength to\nthree-quarter inch first grade manila rope. (g) Platform requirements. Wood platforms of two-point suspension scaffolds shall\ncomply with one of the following requirements. Metal platforms or other\nplatforms not in compliance with this Part (rule) shall be approved. (1)\n\nLadder type platforms. (i) The side stringers of the horizontal\nsupporting ladder shall be constructed of clear spruce or other material of\nequivalent strength and durability. The rungs shall be constructed of\nstraight-grained oak, ash or hickory not less than one and one-eight inches in\ndiameter with seven-eights inch tenons mortised into the side stringers at\nleast seven-eights of an inch. The stringers shall be tied together with metal\ntie rods not less than one-quarter inch in diameter. Such tie rods shall pass\nthrough the stringers and shall be riveted tight against washers at both ends. Hangers shall be securely fastened to the platforms not less than six inches\nnor more than 18 inches from either end by means of U-bolts at the bottom\nsupporting member. Such U-bolts shall pass over the side rails of the\nplatforms. (See Tables XII and XIII of this Subpart.)\n(ii)\n\nThe flooring strips of ladder type\nplatforms shall be spaced so that any opening in the platform floors will\nreject a three-quarter inch diameter ball. Ladder type platforms shall be\nconstructed in accordance with the schedules listed in Tables XII and XIII of\nthis Subpart. (2)\n\nPlank\ntype platforms. Plank type platforms shall be constructed of planks not\nless than two inches in thickness and eight inches in width, full size. Such\nplanks shall extend not less than six inches nor more than 18 inches beyond the\nsupporting hangers. A bar shall be nailed across the platform on the underside\nat each end to prevent the platform from slipping off the hangers. Where two or\nmore planks are used, they shall be fastened together by cleats not less than\none inch by six inches in size. Such cleats shall be nailed on the underside at\nintervals of not more than four feet. Planks used for such platforms shall not\nbe spliced. Any span between supports shall not exceed 10 feet. (3)\n\nBeam platforms. Beam platforms shall have stringers constructed of\nstraight-grained lumber not less than two inches by six inches full size set on\nedge. The stringers shall be supported on the hangers and the clear spans\nbetween hangers shall not exceed 16 feet. The ends of the stringers shall\nextend beyond the hangers not less than six inches nor more than 18 inches. The\nstringers shall be bolted to the hangers by means of U-bolts which pass around\nthe hangers and through the stringers. The platforms shall be supported on\ncross-beams not less than two inches by six inches full size which are laid\nflat and let into the upper edges of the stringers at intervals of not more\nthan four feet. Such cross-beams shall fit snugly and shall be securely nailed\nin place with screw-type nails. The platforms shall be constructed of lumber\nnot less than one inch by six inches in size, nailed tight together and\nextended to the outside faces of the stringers. The ends of all platform boards\nshall rest on the cross-beams and shall be securely nailed thereto.
