Tit. 8 §§ 30-2.13 - Monitoring and consequences for non-compliance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ndepartment will annually monitor and analyze trends and patterns in teacher and\nprincipal evaluation results and data to identify districts and/or schools\nwhere evidence suggests that a more rigorous evaluation system is needed to\nimprove educator effectiveness and student learning outcomes. The department\nwill analyze data submitted pursuant to this Subpart to identify: (1)\nschools or districts with unacceptably\nlow correlation results between student growth on the student performance\ncategory and the teacher observation/principal school visit category used by\nthe district to evaluate its teachers and principals; and/or\n(2)\nschools or districts whose teacher and\nprincipal overall ratings and subcomponent scores and/or ratings show little\ndifferentiation across educators and/or the lack of differentiation is not\njustified by equivalently consistent student achievement results; and/or\nschools or districts that show a pattern of anomalous results in the student\nperformance and observation/school visits categories. (b) A district identified by the department\nin one of the categories enumerated above may be highlighted in public reports\nand/or the commissioner may order a corrective action plan, which may include, but not be limited to, a timeframe for the district to address any deficiencies\nor the plan will be rejected by the commissioner, changes to the district's\ntarget setting process, a requirement that the district arrange for additional\nprofessional learning, that the district provide additional in-service training\nand/or utilize independent trained evaluators to review the efficacy of the\nevaluation system. (c) Corrective\naction plans may require changes to a collective bargaining agreement, subject\nto collective bargaining under article 14 of the Civil Service Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
