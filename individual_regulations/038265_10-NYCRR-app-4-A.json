Part 4\n)\n\nInterpretation of Legionella Culture Results from Cooling Towers\n\nLegionella Test Results in CFU/mL\n1\n\nResponse\n\nNo detection (<20 CFU/mL)\n\nMaintain treatment program and Legionella monitoring in accordance with the maintenance program and plan. For levels at >=20 CFU/mL but <1000 CFU/mL perform the following: * Review treatment program. * Institute immediate online disinfection\n2\nto help with control. * Retest the water in 3-7 days. * Continue to retest at the same time interval until one sample retest result is < 20 CFU/mL. With receipt of result < 20 CFU/mL, resume routine maintenance program and plan. * If retest is\n>\n20 CFU/mL but < 100 CFU/mL, repeat online disinfection\n2\nand retest until < 20 CFU/mL attained. * If retest is >= 100 CFU/mL but < 1000 CFU/mL, further investigate the water treatment program and immediately perform online disinfection. 2\n\nRetest and repeat attempts at control strategy until < 20 CFU/mL attained. * If retest is\n>\n1000 CFU/mL, undertake control strategy as noted below. For levels\n>\n1000 CFU/mL perform the following: * Review the treatment program and provide appropriate notifications per section\n4-1.6\nof this Subpart. * Institute immediate online decontamination\n3\nto help with control. * Retest the water in 3-7 days. * Continue to retest at the same time interval until one sample retest result is < 20 CFU/mL. With receipt of result < 20 CFU/mL, resume routine maintenance program and plan. * If any retest is\n>\n20 CFU/mL but < 100 CFU/mL, repeat online disinfection\n2\nand retest until < 20 CFU/mL attained. * If any retest is\n>\n100 CFU/mL but < 1000 CFU/mL, further investigate the water treatment program and immediately perform online disinfection. 2\n\nRe-test and repeat attempts at control strategy until < 20 CFU/mL attained. * If any retest is\n>\n1000 CFU/mL: * carry out system decontamination\n4\n1\n\nColony forming units per milliliter. 2\n\nOnline disinfection means - Dose the cooling tower water system with either a different biocide or a similar biocide at an increased concentration than currently used. 3\n\nOnline decontamination means - Dose the recirculation water with a halogen-based compound (chlorine or bromine) equivalent to at least 5 milligrams per liter (mg/L) or parts per million (ppm) free residual halogen for at least one hour. 4\n\nSystem decontamination means - Maintain between 5 to 10 mg/L (ppm) free residual halogen for a minimum of one hour; drain and flush with disinfected water; clean wetted surface; refill and dose to 1 - 5 mg/L (ppm) of free residual halogen and circulate for 30 minutes. Refill, re-establish treatment and retest for verification of treatment. For chlorine treatment the pH range should be 7.0 to 7.6; for bromine treatment the pH range should be 7.0 to 8.7. At higher pH values the treatment times may need to be extended. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. tit. 10, APPENDICES, app\n4-A\nStabilized halogen products should not be used for online\ndecontamination or system decontamination as defined in this Appendix per\nfootnotes 3 and 4. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
