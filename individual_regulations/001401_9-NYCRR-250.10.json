Selection and award shall be documented by a\nwritten determination in the procurement record made by the State agency in a\nmanner consistent with the provisions of the solicitation. In the event two\noffers for commodities are found to be substantially equivalent, price shall be\nthe basis for determining the award recipient or, when price and other factors\nare found to be substantially equivalent, the determination of the commissioner\nor agency head to award a contract to one or more of such bidders shall be\nfinal.
