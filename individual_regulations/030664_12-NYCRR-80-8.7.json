  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 80-8.7 - Test method, wall and top material\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Test specimen. The test specimens shall be rectangles of cloth 23/4\ninches by 12 inches\n(±\n1\n/\n16\ninch) with the\nlong dimensions parallel to either the warp or filling directions of the\nmaterial. (b) Test\napparatus required. (1)\n\nCabinet. A\ncabinet and accessories, fabricated in accordance with the requirements\nspecified in Figures A, B and C. Galvanized sheet metal or other suitable metal\nshall be used. The entire inside back wall of the cabinet shall be painted\nblack to facilitate the viewing of the test specimen and pilot flame. (2)\n\nBurner. The burner used in the test shall\nconform to the following: (i) The burner shall\nbe equipped with a variable orifice to adjust the flame height, a barrel having\na\n3\n/\n8\ninch\ninside diameter, and a pilot light. (ii)\n\nThe burner may be constructed by\ncombining a\n3\n/\n8\ninch\ninside diameter barrel 3 ±1/4 inches long from a fixed orifice burner\nwith a base from a variable orifice burner. (iii)\n\nThe pilot light tube shall have a\ndiameter of approximately\n1\n/\n16\ninch and\nshall be spaced\n1\n/\n8\ninch away\nfrom the burner edge with a pilot flame\n1\n/\n8\ninch\nlong. (iv)\n\nThe necessary gas\nconnections and the applicable plumbing shall be as specified in Figure D\nexcept that a solenoid valve may be used in lieu of the stopcock valve to which\nthe burner is attached. The stopcock valve or solenoid valve, whichever is\nused, shall be capable of being fully opened or fully closed in 0.1\nsecond. (v) On the side of the\nbarrel of the burner, opposite the pilot light there shall be a metal rod of\napproximately\n1\n/\n8\ninch\ndiameter spaced 1/2 inch from the barrel and extending above the burner. The\nrod shall have two\n5\n/\n16\ninch\nprongs marking the distances of 3/4 inch and 11/2 inches above the top of the\nburner. (vi)\n\nThe burner shall be\nfixed in a position so that the center of the barrel of the burner is directly\nbelow the center of the specimen. (3)\n\nControl valve system. A control valve\nsystem with a delivery rate designed to furnish gas to the burner under a\npressure of 21/2±1/4 lbs. per square inch at the burner inlet. The\nmanufacturer's recommended delivery rate for the valve system shall include the\nrequired pressure. (4)\n\nGas. The gas\nused shall be Matheson Manufactured Gas Type B or the equivalent. (5)\n\nMetal hooks and weights. Metal hooks and\nweights to produce a series of total loads to determine damaged length. The\nmetal hooks shall consist of 19 gauge steel wire or equivalent and shall be\nmade from 3 inch lengths of the wire and bent 1/2 inch from one end to a 45\ndegree hook. One end of the hook shall be fastened around the neck of the\nweight to be used. (6)\n\nStop watch. Stop watch or other device to measure the burning time to 0.2 second. (7)\n\nScale. Scale, graduated in 0.1 inch to\nmeasure the damaged length. (c) Test procedure. The following procedures shall be followed when testing\nwall and top material: (1)\n\nThe\nspecimen in its holder shall be suspended vertically in the cabinet in such a\nmanner that the entire length of the specimen is exposed and the lower end is\n3/4 inch above the top of the gas burner. The apparatus shall be set up in a\ndraft free area. (2)\n\nPrior to\ninserting the specimen, the pilot flame shall be adjusted to approximately\n1\n/\n8\ninch in\nheight measured from its lowest point to the tip. The burner flame shall be\nadjusted by means of the needle valve in the base of the burner to give a flame\nheight of 11/2 inches\n(±\n1\n/\n16\ninch) with the\nstopcock fully open and the air supply to the burner shut off and taped. The\n11/2 inch flame height is obtained by adjusting the valve so that the uppermost\nportion (tip) of the flame is level with the tip of the metal prong (see Figure\nB) specified for adjustment of flame height. It is an important aspect of the\nevaluation that the flame height be adjusted with the tip of the flame level\nwith the tip of the metal prong. After inserting the specimen, the stopcock\nshall be fully opened, and the burner flame applied vertically at the middle of\nthe lower edge of the specimen for 12 seconds (±.2 second) and the\nburner turned off. The cabinet door shall remain shut during testing. (3)\n\nThe afterflame time for each specimen\nshall be recorded to the nearest 0.2 seconds. After flaming and glowing have\nceased, the specimen shall be removed from the cabinet. (4)\n\nAfter each specimen is removed, the test\ncabinet shall be cleared of fumes and smoke prior to testing the next\nspecimen. (5)\n\nAfter both flaming\nand glowing have ceased, the damaged length shall be measured. The damaged\nlength shall be the distance from the end of the specimen, which was exposed to\nthe flame, to the end of a tear (made lengthwise) of the specimen through the\ncenter of the damaged area as follows: The specimen shall be folded lengthwise\nand creased by hand along a line through the highest peak of the damaged area. The hook shall be inserted in the specimen (or a hole, 1/4 inch diameter or\nless, punched out for the hook) at one side of the damaged area 1/4 inch from\nthe adjacent outside edge and 1/4 inch in from the lower end. A weight of\nsufficient size such that the weight and hook together shall equal the total\ntearing load required in Table 2 shall be attached to the specimen. (6)\nA tearing force shall be applied gently\nto the specimen by grasping the corner of the cloth at the opposite edge of the\nchar from the load and raising the specimen and weight clear of the supporting\nsurface. The end of the tear shall be marked off on the edge and the damaged\nlength measurement made along the undamaged edge. The specific loads applicable\nto the weight of the test material are contained in Table 2. TABLE 2-Loads For Determining Damaged\n\nLength\n\nUntreated weight of material being\ntested-ounces per square yard\n\nTotal tear weight for determining the\ndamaged length-pounds\n\nNot exceeding 6.0\n0.25\n\nOver 6.0 and not exceeding 15.0\n0.50\n\nOver 15.0 and not exceeding 23.0\n0.75\n\nOver 23.0\n1.00\n(7)\n\nThe damaged length for each specimen\nshall be recorded to the nearest 0.1 inch. (d) Report. (1)\n\nThe afterflame time and damaged length of\nthe sample unit shall be the average of the results obtained from the\nindividual specimens tested. All values obtained from the individual specimens\nshall be recorded. (2)\n\nThe\nafterflame time shall be reported to the nearest 0.2 second and the damaged\nlength to the nearest 0.1 inch.
