  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 2.9 - Milking barn, stable or parlor-construction and maintenance-item 2r\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A milking barn, stable or parlor shall be provided on all dairy farms in which the milking herd\nshall be housed during milking time operations. The areas used for milking\npurposes shall meet the following requirements: (1)\n\nFloors, feed troughs (and gutters if\npresent) shall be constructed of good quality concrete or equally impervious\nmaterial. Floors shall be constructed so as to be easily cleaned (brushed\nsurfaces permitted) and shall be graded to drain. (2)\n\nWalls and ceilings are finished with\nwood, tile, smooth-surfaced concrete, cement plaster, brick or other equivalent\nmaterials with light-colored surfaces. Walls, partitions, doors, shelves, windows and ceilings shall be kept in good repair, and surfaces shall be\nrefinished whenever wear or discoloration is evident. Whenever feed is stored\noverhead, ceilings shall be constructed to prevent the sifting of chaff and\ndust into the milking barn, stable or parlor. If a hay opening is provided from\nthe loft into the milking portion of the barn, such opening shall be provided\nwith a dust-tight door which shall be kept closed during milking\noperations. (3)\n\nSeparate pens shall\nbe provided for bulls, horses and calves. These areas shall be separated by\ntight partitions from the milking area. Such portion of the barn not so\nseparated shall comply with all items of this section. In addition, a curbing\nshall be provided to separate horses, bulls and calves from the milking area. The curbing shall effectively eliminate the flow of manure and urine from such\nareas. (4)\n\nThe milking barn is\nprovided with sufficient light to insure that all surfaces and particularly the\nworking areas will be plainly visible. The equivalent of at least 10\nfoot-candles of light in all working areas shall be provided; notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, a dairy farm which produces milk for non-Grade A shall be exempt\nfrom the 10 foot-candles requirement of this paragraph. (5)\n\nAir circulation is sufficient to minimize\nodors and to prevent condensation upon walls and ceilings. (6)\n\nOvercrowding is not evidenced by the\npresence of calves, cows or other barnyard animals in walks or feed alleys. Inadequate ventilation and excessive odors may also be evidence of an\novercrowded barn. (7)\nA dust-tight\npartition, provided with doors that are kept closed except when in actual use, shall separate the milking portion of the barn from any feed room or silo in\nwhich feed is ground or mixed, or in which sweet feed is stored. Feed may be\nstored in the milking portion of the barn only in such manner as will not\nincrease the dust content of the air, attract flies or interfere with cleaning\nof the floor (as in covered, dust-tight boxes or bins). Open feed dollies or\ncarts may be used for distributing the feed, but not storing feed, in the\nmilking barn. (b) When\nconditions warrant, the commissioner may approve a barn without four walls\nextending from floor to roof, or a shed-type barn provided the requirement of\nsection\n2.10\nof this Part (Item 3r)\nprohibiting animals and fowl entering the barn is satisifed. Cattle-housing\nareas (stables without stanchions, such as loose-housing stables, pen stables, resting barns, free-stall barns, holding barns, loafing sheds, wandering sheds)\nmay be of shed-type construction, provided no milking is conducted therein. They are classified as part of the cowyard under section\n2.11\nof this Part (Item\n4r). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n2.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
