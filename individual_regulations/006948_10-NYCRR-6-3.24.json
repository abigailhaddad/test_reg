The water supply serving all plumbing fixtures, including drinking fountains, lavatories and showers, shall, after treatment, meet the provisions required for a public water system as defined in the State Sanitary Code (Subpart 5-1 of this Title). A spray ground with an on-site water supply that does not meet the definition of a public water system must comply with the standards established in Subpart 5-1 of this Title for a non-community water system. (2)\n\nCross-connection control. All portions of the water distribution system serving the spray pad and auxiliary facilities shall be protected against backflow and back-siphonage. Water introduced into the spray pad, either directly or to the recirculation system, shall be supplied through an air gap or by another method which will prevent backflow and back- siphonage.

Approval of the system must be obtained from the appropriate regulatory agency. (f) Spray pad treatment system design. (1)\n\nThe water from the spray pad treatment system cannot be combined/circulated with water from other aquatic facilities such as swimming pools, water slides, or wave pools unless: (i) all the water from the spray pad is treated by ultraviolet (uv) light disinfection prior to combining/circulating with water from the other aquatic facilities; or\n(ii)\nUV light disinfection must be provided to treat all of the water in the other aquatic facilities. The minimum flow rate through the treatment system shall be calculated using the two techniques described below. The larger flow rate resulting from the two calculations shall be the minimum flow rate used for the treatment system design. All recirculated water must pass through both the ultraviolet light unit(s) and filters; (a) minimum flow for ultraviolet light disinfection: Image\nQ is in gallons per minute through the ultraviolet disinfection/filtration system\nV is in gallons and is the volume of the pool. Number of turnovers = 14.8-ln(V)\n\nThe term ln(V) is the natural log of the volume; (b) minimum filtration rate for a combined pool/spray pad system: The minimum filtration rate for a pool that shares water with a spray pad is specified in clause (3)(ii)(c) of this subdivision. The minimum filtration flow rate shall be at least the sum of the flow rate for the pool type specified in Subpart 6-1 of this Title and one third of the spray feature flow rate. (2)\n\nWhen water supplying the spray features is removed from the spray pad treatment tank by a pump separate from the filtration/recirculation pump system, the ratio of the flow rate of water supplied to the spray features directly from the treatment tank must not exceed three times the design filtered water flow rate. (3)\n\nRecirculation systems and equipment. A recirculation system consisting of pumps, piping, filters, water conditioning and disinfection equipment, and other accessory equipment, shall be provided which will clarify, chemically balance and disinfect the spray pad water. The spray pad treatment tank filtration, circulation and spray pad chemical disinfection equipment must operate 24 hours a day. (i) Equipment approval. Equipment used or proposed for use in spray pad water treatment shall be of proven design and construction and other than ultraviolet light units be tested and listed by the National Sanitation Foundation (NSF) or another testing laboratory under standards promulgated by NSF. (ii)\n\nTurnover rate. (a) When water is supplied to the spray features by a pump which removes water directly from the spray pad treatment tank independent from the spray pad treatment tank filter pump, the turnover rate for filtration will be determined by the feature flow rate. The filtration flow rate for the spray pad treatment tank must be at least one-third of the design spray feature flow rate. (b) When all of the water supplied to the spray features is filtered upon removal from the spray pad treatment tank before being supplied to the spray features, a reduced pumping rate for filtration/treatment of the spray pad treatment tank water can be used when the spray features are not in operation. However, a minimum four-hour turnover rate is required. (c) The minimum flow rate through the filtration system for combined pool/spray pad systems shall be equal to or greater than the sum of the flow rate for the specific type pool as required by Subpart 6-1 of this Title, plus one third of the spray feature flow rate.
