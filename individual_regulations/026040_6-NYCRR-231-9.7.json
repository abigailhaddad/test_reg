The following provisions set forth\nthe requirements for an application to renew a title V permit where a PAL will\nexpire at the end of the PAL effective period and the facility has not included\na request to renew the PAL in such application. The facility must continue to\ncomply with the PAL until such time as the department issues a renewed title V\npermit. (1)\n\nApplication content. In addition\nto any other information required pursuant to this Chapter, the title V permit\napplication must include a proposed allowable emission limitation for each\nemission source. Such emission limitations must be calculated by distributing\nthe PAL of the facility among each emission source that is subject to an\nemission limitation under the PAL and must be adjusted to reflect any\napplicable requirements that became effective during the PAL effective period\nif the PAL was not previously adjusted. (2)\n\nPermit content. In addition to any other\nrequirements of this Chapter, a title V permit issued following the expiration\nof a PAL shall include the following provisions: (i) emission limits for each emission source\non a 12-month rolling basis. The allowable emission limits shall be established\nin accordance with a distribution of the PAL that the department determines is\nappropriate; and\n(ii)\na facility\nmust demonstrate compliance with the allowable emission limitation(s) through\nthe use of CEMS or other monitoring systems (source testing, emission factors, etc.) as the department may approve. (b) 'Permit renewal where a PAL is renewed'. (1)\n\nApplication deadline. The application\ndeadlines for renewal of the title V permits in Part 201 of this Title shall\ngovern the application to renew a PAL. (2)\n\nApplication content. The application to\nrenew a permit with a PAL must contain the following information: (i) the information required in section\n231-9.2\n(a) through\n(c) of this Subpart; (ii)\na proposed PAL; (iii)\nthe sum of the potential to emit of all\nemission sources subject to the PAL with supporting documentation; and\n(iv)\nany other relevant\ninformation the owner or operator submits to the department for consideration\nin determining the appropriate level for renewing the PAL. (3)\nPAL adjustment. In determining whether\nand how to adjust the PAL, the department must consider the options outlined\nbelow. All adjustments must comply with subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph: (i) if the emissions level calculated in\naccordance with section\n231-9.4\n(a) through\n(d) of this Subpart is equal to or greater\nthan 80 percent of the level of the existing PAL at the time of renewal, the\ndepartment may renew the PAL at the same level, without considering the factors\nset forth in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph; or\n(ii)\nthe department may set the PAL at a\nlevel that the department determines is more representative of the baseline\nactual emissions of the facility, or is more appropriate considering air\nquality needs, advances in control technology, anticipated economic growth in\nthe area, desire to reward or encourage voluntary emissions reductions at the\nfacility, or other factors as specifically identified by the\ndepartment. (iii)\nnotwithstanding\nsubparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph: ('a')\nif the potential to emit of the\nfacility is less than the PAL, the department must adjust the PAL to a level no\ngreater than the potential to emit of the facility; and\n('b')\nthe department cannot approve a renewed\nPAL higher than the current PAL, unless the facility has complied with the\nprovisions of section\n231-9.6\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (iv)\nsection\n231-9.4\n(e) of this\n\nSubpart is inapplicable to the renewal of a PAL. (4)\n\nIf the compliance date for an applicable\nrequirement occurs during the PAL effective period, and the department has not\nalready adjusted the PAL to reflect such requirement, the PAL must be adjusted\nat the time of permit renewal.
