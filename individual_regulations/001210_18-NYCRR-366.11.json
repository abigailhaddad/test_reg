(b) The quarterly report form must contain\nthe following information: (1)\nperiodic\nincome and dates received, household composition and other circumstances\nrelevant in determining the amount of assistance; and\n(2)\nany changes in income, household\ncomposition or other relevant circumstances affecting eligibility for or the\namount of benefits which the household expects to occur in the current or\nfuture months. (c) The\nquarterly reporting process does not relieve participants of their\nresponsibility to report changes that impact eligibility in a timely manner. Participants must submit timely reports of all changes affecting eligibility, with the exception of changes in income, no later than 10 days after each\nchange occurs. Participants will not be required to report changes in income\nmore frequently than quarterly.

(e) Failure to submit a completed report. If a participant fails, without good\ncause, to return a completed quarterly report by the 10th day of the process\nmonth, the social services district must send a timely and adequate notice of\ndiscontinuance along with a copy of any quarterly report which was returned\nincomplete or along with a second quarterly report if no report has been\nreturned. (f) If the participant\nresponds to the discontinuance notice and submits a completed report before the\neffective date of the discontinuance, the social services district must accept\nthe completed quarterly report and void the notice of discontinuance.
