  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 687.2 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The family care\nprogram (see section\n687.99\nof this Part) has been\ndeveloped to make it possible for a certified family care provider to care for\nan individual or individuals in the provider's own home, thus providing a\nfamily-oriented, home-like environment. (b) Family care placement is available, in\naccordance with processes established by OPWDD, to those individuals with\nintellectual and/or developmental disabilities who do not need residential care\nand treatment in a more restrictive, structured setting, but who are unable to\nfunction adequately in their own homes or for whom the family-oriented\nenvironment is more appropriate than other available community settings or\nindependent community living arrangements. (c) Family care placement should be seen, not\nonly for the purpose of providing a place of residence, but also as\ncontributing to the overall personal development process of the\nindividual(s). (d) In all cases, a\nfamily care home shall provide a residential environment that approximates, as\nclosely as possible, a family setting which enables and encourages individuals\nto participate in family and community life on an equal status with other\nmembers of the household. Thus, one of the primary goals of a family care\nplacement is the acceptance of a person as a full member of the household so as\nto share in that household's pleasures and responsibilities. (e) Exceptions to the provisions of this\n\nPart, other than statutory requirements, may be made by the commissioner (see\nsection\n687.99\nof this Part) when it is\ndetermined that an exception is necessary and in the best interest of an\nindividual(s) and is consistent with the health, safety and welfare of the\nindividual(s).
