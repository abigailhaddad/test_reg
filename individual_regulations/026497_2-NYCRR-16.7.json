  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 16.7 - Cafeterias and commissaries\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Accounting records shall be kept on an accrual basis in order to reflect\nproperly the assets and liabilities and to determine the profit or loss from\noperations. This requirement is especially necessary where the activity must be\noperated on a self-sustaining basis, so that the price of goods sold shall be\nsufficient to defray all cost. A physical inventory shall be taken at the close\nof each fiscal year. (b) Receipts\nshall be controlled, wherever practicable, through cash registers, or by the\nuse of bound press-numbered receipt books or tickets. Expenditures shall be\nsupported by invoices or vouchers approved by an authorized person. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n16.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
