  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-5.1 - General provisions for all scaffolds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Scope of this Subpart. The provisions of\nthis Subpart pertaining to all scaffolds used in construction and demolition\noperations shall not be construed or applied in contravention of the special\nprovisions pertaining to specific types of scaffolds hereinafter set\nforth. (b) Scaffold footing or\nanchorage. The footing or anchorage for every scaffold erected on or supported\nby the ground, grade or equivalent surface shall be sound, rigid, capable of\nsupporting the maximum load intended to be imposed thereon without settling or\ndeformation and shall be secure against movement in any direction. Unstable\nsupports, such as barrels, boxes, loose brick or loose stone, shall not be\nused. (c) Scaffold structure. (1)\n\nExcept where otherwise specifically\nprovided in this Subpart, all scaffolding shall be so constructed as to bear\nfour times the maximum weight required to be dependent therefrom or placed\nthereon when in use. (See Labor Law, §240, subdivision 3.) Such maximum\nweight shall be construed to mean the sum of both dead and live loads. Exception:Paragraph (1) above does not apply to scaffold\nsuspension ropes. (See section\n23-5.19\nof this Subpart.)\n(2)\n\nEvery scaffold shall be\nprovided with adequate horizontal and diagonal bracing to prevent any lateral\nmovement. (d) Scaffold\nloading. (1)\n\nLight duty scaffolds shall not\nbe loaded with live loads in excess of 25 pounds per square foot. (2)\n\nMedium duty scaffolds shall not be loaded\nwith live loads in excess of 50 pounds per square foot. (3)\n\nHeavy duty scaffolds shall not be loaded\nwith live loads in excess of 75 pounds per square foot. (4)\n\nNo scaffold shall be loaded in excess of\nthe maximum load for which it is intended. (e) Scaffold planking. (1)\n\nExcept on needle beam and pole scaffolds, scaffold planks shall extend not less than six inches beyond any support nor\nmore than 18 inches beyond any end support. Such six inch minimum requirement\nshall not apply when such planks are securely fastened in place. Scaffold\nplanks shall be laid tight and inclined planking shall be securely fastened in\nplace. (2)\n\nThe maximum permissible\nlive load for two-inch full size planking shall be as follows: (i) Heavy duty scaffolds--75 pounds per\nsquare foot for spans up to and including six feet. (ii)\n\nMedium duty scaffolds--50 pounds per\nsquare foot for spans over six feet and up to and including eight\nfeet. (iii)\n\nLight duty\nscaffolds--25 pounds per square foot for spans over eight feet and up to and\nincluding 10 feet. (3)\n\nThe maximum permissible live load for two-inch nominal thickness planking shall\nbe as follows: (i) Light duty scaffolds--25\npounds per square foot for spans over six feet and up to and including eight\nfeet. (ii)\n\nMedium duty\nscaffolds--50 pounds per square foot for spans up to and including six\nfeet. (iii)\n\nHeavy duty\nscaffolds--two-inch nominal thickness planking shall not be used for heavy duty\nscaffolds. (4)\n\nThe\nmaximum permissible live load for one and one-quarter inch full size planking\nshall be 50 pounds per square foot for spans up to and including four\nfeet. (5)\n\nThe minimum width of\nevery planked scaffold platform shall be 18 inches except for the following: (i) Bench type scaffolds where the working\nplatforms are not more than 24 inches above the floor or other supporting\nsurface shall be not less than nine inches in width. (ii)\n\nTrestle and extension trestle ladder\nscaffold platforms shall have widths equal to the distances between the side\nrails of the ladders, but in no case shall such platforms be less than 12\ninches in width. (f) Scaffold maintenance and repair. Every\nscaffold shall be maintained in good repair and every defect, unsafe condition\nor noncompliance with this Part (rule) shall be immediately corrected before\nfurther use of such scaffold. (g) Scaffold lumber. All lumber used in the construction of scaffolds and scaffold\nplatforms shall be stress-grade, having a minimum unit stress \"f\" of 1500 psi. The use of scaffold lumber shall be in conformance with the grade\nclassification, i.e. lumber graded for use as posts or columns shall not be\nused where beams or joists are required. All lumber subjected to stress shall\nbe sound, straight grained, free from shakes, large, loose or dead knots or\nchecks or from any other defects which may impair its strength or\ndurability. (h) Scaffold erection\nand removal. Every scaffold shall be erected and removed under the supervision\nof a designated person. (i) Overhead protection. Overhead protection when required for any scaffold shall\nconsist of planking not less than two inches thick full size, exterior grade\nplywood not less than three-quarters inch thick or material of equivalent\nstrength. Such planks used for overhead protection shall be laid tight, shall\nextend the full length and width of the working platform. Such overhead\nprotection shall be located not more than 10 feet above the surface of the\nworking platform. Such overhead protection shall not be used to support any\nperson, material, tools or equipment. (j) Safety railings. (1)\n\nThe open sides of all scaffold platforms, except those platforms listed in the exception below, shall be provided with\nsafety railings constructed and installed in compliance with this Part (rule). Exceptions:Any scaffold platform with an elevation of not\nmore than seven feet; the platforms of needle beam scaffolds; floats and rivet\nheater platforms in use by structural ironworkers; ladder jack scaffold\nplatforms; and trestle and extension trestle ladder scaffold platforms. (2)\n\nAll scaffolds under which any\nperson is likely to work or pass shall be provided with a wire mesh screen of\nnot less than No. 18 U.S. gage steel with openings that will reject a one- inch\ndiameter ball. Such wire mesh screen shall be installed between the toeboard\nand the top guard rail on both ends and on the outboard side of the scaffold\nplatform. (3)\n\nAny end or side of\nany scaffold platform that is located within six feet horizontally of an\nunenclosed side of a material hoist tower, construction elevator or similar\nmoving equipment shall be effectively screened to a height of at least six feet\nabove the scaffold platform. Such screen shall be constructed of wire mesh of\nnot less than No. 18 U.S. gage steel with openings that will reject a one-inch\ndiameter ball. (k) Splices. Horizontal load-bearing members of any scaffold shall not be spliced\nbetween points of support. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n23-5.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
