  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 80.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 483, 484 and 488\n(a) The Cigarette Marketing Standards Act\n(also known as the cigarette marketing standards or CMSA) contained in article\n20-A of the Tax Law, as an ally to the cigarette tax imposed by article 20 of\nsuch law, is intended to stabilize all levels of the New York State cigarette\nindustry, in the best interests of such industry, the State and the consuming\npublic. The cigarette marketing standards take cognizance of the inherent\nfunctions of agents, wholesale dealers, chain stores and retail dealers with\nrespect to the distribution of cigarettes in this State. Any attempt to debase\nsuch functions shall be considered to be contrary to the purpose of the\n\nCigarette Marketing Standards Act. Additionally, the cigarette marketing\nstandards, in order to prevent unfair or destructive competition and deceptive\nor fraudulent trade practices, set forth rebuttable presumptive minimum amounts\nat which cigarettes may be lawfully sold and purchased in New York\n\nState. (b) The cigarette marketing\nstandards contained in article 20-A of the Tax Law and this article shall, to\nthe extent possible, be jointly administered with the cigarette tax imposed\npursuant to article 20 of such law, as reflected in Article 1 of this\n\nSubchapter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n80.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
