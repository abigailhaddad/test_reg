  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 316.2 - Objectives and standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) It is\nthe policy of the State University of New York to take affirmative action to\nensure that minority- and women-owned business enterprises (M/WBEs) are given\nthe opportunity to demonstrate their ability to provide the university with\ncommodities and services at competitive prices. (b) It is the declared policy of the State\n\nUniversity that utilization of preferred sources occur whenever possible. In\naccordance with the provisions of the State Finance Law, section 162 and\nsection 184 of the State Corrections Law, the university is required to make\npurchases of commodities and services from preferred sources such as the\ncorrectional industries program of the New York State Department of\n\nCorrections, approved charitable non-profit agencies for the blind, any\nemployment program serving mentally ill persons which is operated by the New\n\nYork State Office of Mental Health, any qualified charitable non-profit-making\nagency for severely disabled persons approved by the New York State\n\nCommissioner of Education, or veterans workshops operated by the United States\n\nDepartment of Veterans Affairs and approved by the New York State Commissioner\nof Education. Preferred sources must be considered whenever purchases of\ncommodities or services are required. Form, function and utility requirements\nmay be considered. Where a preferred source is to be used for the provision of\ncommodities or services, no competitive selection process or publication in the\n\nNew York State Contract Reporter is required. In the event a specific preferred\nsource is to be rejected, that source must be given prior written notice with\nan explanation and an opportunity to respond. (c) State University's basic procurement\nobjective is to secure the most appropriate materials, supplies, equipment, services, and construction at the lowest available price, consistent with\nquality requirements and delivery needs as will best promote the interests of\n\nState University. Competitive bidding, whether formal (sealed bids or\nproposals) or informal (quotations) should be used to the extent practicable. All bids may be rejected at the discretion of the university. Purchases may be\nmade directly by a campus or pursuant to any contract let by the Office of\n\nGeneral Services, a consortium or any other State or Federal agency. (d) Standard State contract clauses (Exhibit\nA) are generally attached to all State University contracts and purchase\norders. In the alternative, purchase orders may contain a statement that the\nprovisions of Exhibit A are incorporated by reference. These clauses include\nprovisions mandated by State law, and also provide notice to vendors that they\nmust comply with the requirements of the MacBride Fair Employment Principles\nand the provisions of the Omnibus Procurement Act. In addition, detailed\naffirmative action provisions (Exhibit A-1) should be attached to every\ncontract, subcontract or purchase order exceeding $25,000, construction\ncontract exceeding $100,000, or construction subcontract exceeding\n$25,000. (e) The State University\nmay generally not purchase tropical hardwoods or products, as defined in the\n\nState Finance Law, section 165(1), in any form for any purpose. Any bid or\nresponse which calls for the use of any tropical hardwood or wood product in\nits performance shall be considered non-responsive. (f) The State University is required to\npurchase recycled, remanufactured or recyclable commodities when such\ncommodities meet form, function and utility requirements, taking into\nconsideration the cost of the commodity over its life cycle. The State\n\nUniversity shall also have the authority to determine that for reasons of\npublic health or safety, a recycled, remanufactured or recyclable commodity\nshould not be purchased. Such determinations shall be documented in the\nprocurement record. If the cost of a recycled commodity (but not recyclable or\nremanufactured commodity unless also recycled) does not exceed the cost of a\ncommodity made without recycled content by 10 percent (or by 15 percent if over\n50 percent of the recycled materials are generated from the New York State\nwaste stream), the recycled commodity must be purchased. For purposes of this\nsubdivision: (1)\na recycled commodity is a\ncommodity that has been manufactured from secondary materials as defined in the\n\nEconomic Development Law and that meets the secondary material content\nrequirements of the Office of General Services; (2)\na remanufactured commodity is a commodity\nthat has been restored to its original performance standards and function and\nis thereby diverted from the solid waste stream, retaining, to the extent\npracticable, components that have been through at least one life cycle and\nreplacing consumable or normal wear components; and\n(3)\na recyclable commodity is a commodity\nthat can be collected, separated, or otherwise recovered from the solid waste\nstream for reuse, remanufacture or assembly of another commodity, through a\nwidely available and easily accessible program. (g) When letting contracts for the purchase\nof food products, the State University may require products that are grown, produced, harvested or processed in New York State. (h) MacBride Fair Employment Principles. State University purchases must comply with the requirements of section\n165\n(5)\nof the State Finance Law. The section\nestablishes the MacBride Fair Employment Principles as standards for employment\nin Northern Ireland. Every prospective university vendor will be required to\nstipulate that either it has no business operations in Northern Ireland, or it\nwill conduct its business in Northern Ireland in accordance with the MacBride\n\nPrinciples relating to non-discrimination in employment and freedom of\nworkplace opportunity and shall permit independent monitoring of its compliance\nwith such principles. Refusal to stipulate to one of the above will result in\nfurther review of the vendor's proposal, as follows: (1)\n\nIn the case of contracts let by a\ncompetitive process, when there is another bidder which has agreed to stipulate\nto such conditions and which has submitted a bid within five percent of the\nlowest responsible bid, a campus shall refer such bids to the Commissioner of\n\nGeneral Services for consultation, after which the State University may\ndetermine that it is in the best interest of the State University that the\ncontract be awarded to other than the lowest price or best value\noffer. (2)\n\nIn the case of contracts\nlet by other than competitive process for commodities or services in excess of\n$30,000 or for construction in excess of $15,000, the campus may not award to\nsuch vendor unless it is determined that there is no other responsible\ncontractor who can supply commodities, services or construction of comparable\nquality at a comparable price. (i) New York State vendors. In accordance\nwith section\n139-i\nof\nthe State Finance Law (Omnibus Procurement Act of 1992), all bid documents must\ninclude a statement that information concerning the availability of New York\n\nState subcontractors and suppliers is available from the New York State Empire\n\nState Development agency, which shall include the directory of certified\nminority-and women-owned businesses, and that it is the policy of New York\n\nState to encourage the use of New York State subcontractors and suppliers, and\nto promote the participation of minority-and women-owned businesses where\npossible, in the procurement of commodities and services. (1)\n\nIt is further required that subsequent to\nthe award of procurement contracts of $1 million or more, all State agencies\nshall ensure that: (i) contractors have\ndocumented their efforts to encourage the participation of the New York State\nbusiness enterprises as suppliers and subcontractors; (ii)\ncontractors have attested to compliance\nwith the Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Act of 1972 ( P.L. 92-261), as\namended; (iii)\ncontractors have\ndocumented their efforts to provide notification to New York State residents of\nemployment opportunities through listing any positions with the Community\n\nServices Division of the New York State Department of Labor or provide for such\nnotification in such a manner as is consistent with existing collective\nbargaining agreements. (2)\n\nFor contracts of $1 million or more for\nthe purchase of commodities and services from a foreign business enterprise, section 139-i requires notification to the Commissioner of the Empire State\n\nDevelopment agency of the award simultaneously with notifying the successful\nbidder. Such notice shall be at least 15 business days prior to contract\nsigning (except for contracts awarded on an emergency or critical basis or\nwhere the Commissioner of the Empire State Development agency has waived this\nrequirement) and shall include: firm name, address, telephone number, facsimile\nnumber, brief description of the commodities or services, the amount and term\nof the proposed contract and the name of the principal contact person at the\nfirm. (3)\n\nAll bid documents shall\ncontain a statement notifying bidders located in foreign countries that the\n\nState University may assign or otherwise transfer offset credits created by any\nprocurement contract of $1 million or more to third parties located in New York\n\nState, and the contractor must agree to cooperate with the State in this\neffort. (j) Section\n165(6) requires the Commissioner of the Empire State Development agency to\nmaintain a list of states which discriminate against New York vendors. State\nagencies are prohibited from soliciting proposals from, or entering into\ncontracts with, businesses from such states. Such prohibition is subject to\nwaiver, in writing, by a campus president, if in the best interest of the\n\nState. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
