  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 174.3 - Correcting mistakes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Correcting mistakes in payments. (1)\n\nUnderpayments by employers. Where an employer has deducted and withheld the\ncorrect amount of New York State personal income tax from the employee but has\nmade an underpayment of such withheld tax during a calendar quarter, and such\nemployer discovers the underpayment prior to filing such employer's quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return for the calendar quarter, such\nemployer must correct the underpayment by making an additional payment with an\nadditional New York State employer's return of tax withheld (form WT-1) during\nthe calendar quarter. For interest on underpayments and additions to tax and\ncivil penalties, see sections\n684\nand\n685\nof the Tax Law. Example:Employer A, in accordance with the provisions of\nsection\n674 (a)(1)\nof the Tax Law\nand section\n174.1\n(b)(1)\nof this Article, is remitting withheld New York State personal income tax after\nmaking a payroll in the first calendar quarter of a calendar year. On A' s New\n\nYork State employer's return of tax withheld (form WT-1) A indicates an amount\ndeducted and withheld of $800 and also indicates an amount remitted of $800. In\nactuality, A mistakenly submits a payment of $700. A discovers the error prior\nto the end of the calendar quarter, and should correct such error by submitting\nan additional employer's return of tax withheld on form WT-1 with a payment of\n$100 prior to the end of such calendar quarter. Interest will be charged and\npenalty may be imposed on the $100 underpayment from the due date of the\noriginal employer's return of tax withheld and payment to the date such $100 is\npaid. (2)\n\nOverpayments by\nemployers. (i) Mistake discovered prior to\nfiling quarterly combined return for the calendar quarter. Where an employer\nhas deducted and withheld the correct amount of New York State personal income\ntax from the employee but has made an overpayment of such withheld tax and such\nemployer discovers the overpayment prior to filing such employer's quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return for the calendar quarter, such\nemployer should make an adjustment by an offset in a subsequent New York State\nemployer's return of tax withheld (form WT-1) being filed in the same calendar\nquarter. Where the employer does not correct the overpayment by offset, then\nthe employer must show such overpayment on Part A of such quarterly combined\nreturn for such quarter and attach an explanation of the computation of the\noverpayment. Such employer may elect on such Part A of the quarterly combined\nreturn to have such overpayment refunded or credited to a subsequent quarter; provided, however, that a seasonal employer, referred to in section\n174.2\n(a)(2)\nof this Part, may only have such overpayment refunded. (ii)\n\nMistake discovered in a subsequent\ncalendar quarter. Where an employer has deducted and withheld the correct\namount of New York State personal income tax from the employee but has made an\noverpayment of such withheld tax and such employer discovers the overpayment\nprior to filing such employer's last quarterly combined withholding and wage\nreporting return for the same calendar year, such employer must file an amended\nquarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return for the quarter in\nwhich the overpayment occurred and attach thereto an explanation of the\ncomputation of the overpayment. Such overpayment may only be refunded; the\nemployer may not elect to credit such overpayment to a subsequent\nquarter. (b) Correcting mistakes in withholding from the employee. (1)\n\nUndercollections. (i) General. Where less than the correct\namount of New York State personal income tax is deducted from any wage payment\nto an employee, the employer is authorized to deduct the amount of the\nundercollection from later wage payments to the employee in the same calendar\nyear. However, the employer is liable for any underpayment of withheld New York\n\nState personal income tax. Reimbursement by the employee is a matter for\nsettlement between the employer and the employee. Where the employee does not\nreimburse the employer, and the employee pays any tax due with such employees\n\nNew York State personal income tax return for the applicable calendar year, then see section\n676\nof the Tax Law and Part 176 of this\n\nArticle. (ii)\n\nUndercollection\ndiscovered prior to filing quarterly combined return for the calendar quarter. Where less than the correct amount of New York State personal income tax has\nbeen deducted from the employee's wages and the employer discovers the\nundercollection prior to filing such employer's quarterly combined withholding\nand wage reporting return for the calendar quarter, such employer must correct\nthe underpayment to the Department of Taxation and Finance by making an\nadditional payment with an additional New York State employer's return of tax\nwithheld (form WT-1) prior to the end of the quarter. For interest on\nunderpayments and additions to tax and civil penalties, see sections\n684\nand\n685\nof the Tax Law. Example:Employer B, in accordance with the provisions of\nsection\n674 (a)(1)\nof the Tax Law\nand section\n174.1\n(b)(1)\nof this Article, is remitting withheld New York State personal income tax after\nmaking a payroll in the second calendar quarter of a calendar year. On B's New\n\nYork State employer's return of tax withheld (form WT-1) B indicates an amount\ndeducted and withheld of $800 and also remits $800. In actuality, B was\nrequired to deduct and withhold $900 of New York State personal income tax. B\ndiscovers the error prior to filing B's quarterly combined withholding and wage\nreporting return for the calendar quarter and should correct such error by\nsubmitting an additional employer's return of tax withheld on form WT-1 and a\npayment of $100 prior to the end of the quarter. Interest will be charged and\npenalty may be imposed on the $100 underpayment from the due date of the\noriginal employer's return of tax withheld and payment to the date such $100 is\npaid. Reimbursement by B's employees is a matter for settlement between B and\nsuch employees. (iii)\n\nUndercollection discovered in subsequent calendar quarter of calendar year. Where less than the correct amount of New York State personal income tax has\nbeen deducted from an employee's wages and the employer discovered the\nundercollection prior to filing such employer's last quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return for the same calendar year, such employer\nmust correct the underpayment of withheld New York State personal income tax by\npaying the amount of the underpayment to the Department of Taxation and Finance\nwith an amended quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return for\nthe quarter in which the underpayment occurred. For interest on underpayments\nand additions to tax and civil penalties, see sections\n684\nand\n685\nof the Tax Law. (2)\n\nOvercollections. (i) General. Where more than the correct\namount of New York State personal income tax is deducted from any wage payment\nto an employee, the amount of the overcollection should be repaid to the\nemployee in the same calendar year in which the overcollection occurred. Where\nan overcollection is repaid to an employee, the employer must obtain and keep\nas part of such employer's records (and make available for inspection by the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance upon request) a written receipt from the\nemployee showing the date and amount of the repayment. Any overcollection not\nrepaid to the employee and not receipted by the employee within the same\ncalendar year must be reported and paid to the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance with the New York State employer's return of tax withheld (form WT-1)\nand/or Part A of the quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return\nin accordance with subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph. (ii)\n\nOvercollection discovered prior to\nfiling quarterly combined return for the calendar quarter. Where more than the\ncorrect amount of New York State personal income tax has been deducted from an\nemployee's wages and the employer discovers the overcollection prior to filing\nthe employer's quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return for the\ncalendar quarter, such employer must correct the overpayment to the Department\nof Taxation and Finance by entering the correct amount of the withholding tax\nliability on Part A of such quarterly combined return. The employer must attach\nto such Part A of the quarterly combined return an explanation of the\ncomputation of the overpayment and must also indicate whether or not such\nemployer has repaid the overcollection to the employee. Where an employer shows\nan overpayment described in this subparagraph on Part A of the quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return for such quarter and has repaid\nthe overcollection to the employee, such employer may elect thereon to have\nsuch overpayment refunded or credited to a subsequent quarter; provided, however, that a seasonal employer, referred to in section\n174.2\n(a)(2)\nof this Part, may only have such overpayment refunded. (iii)\n\nOvercollection discovered in subsequent\ncalendar quarter. Where more than the correct amount of New York State personal\nincome tax has been deducted from an employee's wages and the employer\ndiscovers the overcollection after the filing of the quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return for the calendar quarter in which the\novercollection occurred, but prior to filing such employer's last quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return for the same calendar year, such\nemployer must correct the overpayment to the Department of Taxation and Finance\nby entering the correct amount of the withholding tax liability on an amended\nquarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return. The employer must\nattach to such amended quarterly combined return an explanation of the\ncomputation of the overpayment and must also indicate whether or not such\nemployer has repaid the overcollection to the employee. Where an employer shows\nan overpayment described in this subparagraph on the amended quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return and has repaid the overcollection to the\nemployee, such overpayment may only be refunded; the employer may not elect to\ncredit the overpayment to a subsequent calendar quarter. Example:Employer C, in accordance with the provisions of\nsection\n674 (a)(1)\nof the Tax Law\nand section\n174.1\n(b)(1)\nof this Article, is remitting withheld New York State personal income tax after\nmaking a payroll in the third calendar quarter of a calendar year. On C's New\n\nYork State employer's return of tax withheld (form WT-1), C indicates an amount\ndeducted and withheld of $800 and also remits $800. In actuality, C was\nrequired to deduct and withhold $700 of New York State personal income tax. C\ndiscovers the error prior to filing C's last quarterly combined withholding and\nwage reporting return for such calendar year but after C has distributed forms\nIT-2102 to C's employees. C repays the $100 overcollection to C's employees. C\nmust correct C's reported withholding tax liability for the third calendar\nquarter by filing an amended quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting\nreturn and attaching thereto an explanation of the computation of the\noverpayment and also indicating the C repaid the amount of the overcollection\nto C's employees. C is entitled to a $100 refund of the overpayment. C must\nalso amend the forms IT-2102 issued to C's employees to reflect the $700 amount\nof actual withholding tax liability (see section\n172.1\nof this Article). (c) Any reference in this section to an\namended quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return shall also\ninclude reference to an amended quarterly combined withholding and wage\nreporting EZ return, where applicable. (d) Where any of the mistakes referred to in\nthis section are not corrected after all of the quarterly combined withholding\nand wage reporting returns are filed for the calendar year, such mistakes\nshould be corrected when the employee files such employee's New York State\npersonal income tax return for such calendar year and pays any tax due with\nsuch return. However, the employer may still be liable for any applicable\ninterest, penalties or additions to tax. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
