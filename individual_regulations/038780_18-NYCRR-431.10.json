  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 431.10 - Placement in foster family care of children who are siblings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Foster children\nwho are siblings or half-siblings must not be unnecessarily separated. The\nsocial services district is responsible for ensuring that diligent efforts are\nmade to secure a foster family boarding home or agency boarding home which is\nwilling and able to accept the placement of the siblings together, unless\nplacement together is determined to be detrimental to the best interests of the\nsiblings. Such efforts must be documented in the case record in accordance with\nsection\n428.6\n(b)(6), 428.10\n(d)(6)\nor\n428.11\n(b)(4)\nof\nthis Title. (b) A social services\ndistrict may make a decision that minor siblings or half-siblings should be\nseparated only if placement together is determined to be contrary to the\nhealth, safety or welfare of one or more of the children after consultation\nwith, or an evaluation by, other professional staff, such as a licensed\npsychologist, psychiatrist, other physician, or certified social worker. Factors to be considered in making a determination of whether siblings or\nhalf-siblings should be placed together must include, but are not limited to: (1)\nthe age differentiation of the\nsiblings; (2)\nthe health and\ndevelopmental differences among the siblings; (3)\nthe emotional relationship of the\nsiblings to each other; (4)\nthe\nindividual services needs; (5)\nthe\nattachment of the individual siblings to separate families/locations; and\n(6)\nthe continuity of\nenvironment standards pursuant to section\n430.11\n(c) of this\n\nTitle. The factors used by social services districts to\ndetermine that siblings or half-siblings should be placed apart must be\ndocumented in accordance with section\n428.6, 428.10\n(d)(6)\nor\n428.11\n(b)(4)\nof\nthis Title. (c) If minor siblings or half-siblings are placed apart in foster family boarding\nhomes and/or agency operated boarding homes on an emergency basis, they must be\nreunited within 30 days unless the social services commissioner or a designated\nrepresentative determines it is contrary to the best interests of one or more\nof the siblings to be placed together, after a careful assessment in accordance\nwith subdivision (b) of this section. (d) Foster parents must be informed if any\nchild placed with them has siblings or half- siblings, and if so, the location\nof the siblings or half-siblings. (e) Authorized agencies are responsible for\nensuring that diligent efforts are made to facilitate regular biweekly\nvisitation or communication between minor siblings or half-siblings who have\nbeen placed apart, unless such contact would be contrary to the health, safety\nor welfare of one or more of the children, or unless lack of geographic\nproximity precludes visitation.
