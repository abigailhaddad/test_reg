Except in designated heat dissipation areas (see section\n861.12\n[f][5]\nof\nthis Title): (i) not to exceed 5° F (2.8° C)\nrise above ambient temperature until stream temperature reaches 87° F (30.6°\nC); and\n(ii)\nnatural temperature\nwill prevail above 87° F (30.6° C). (3)\npH. Between 6.5 and 8.5. (4)\n\nPhenols. Not to exceed 0.005 mg/l, unless\ndue to natural conditions. (5)\n\nThreshold odor number. Not to exceed 24 at 60° C.
