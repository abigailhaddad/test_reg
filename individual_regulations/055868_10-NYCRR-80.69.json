(k) Upon expiration of the authorization of the prescription to be refilled or the six month limitation of the prescription, the practitioner shall execute a new prescription if he desires the medication to be continued. (l) When a prescription prepared by a practitioner is incomplete, the practitioner may orally furnish the missing information to the pharmacist and authorize him or her to enter the missing information on the prescription. The pharmacist shall write the date he or she received the oral authorization on the prescription and shall affix his or her signature. This procedure shall not apply to unsigned or undated prescriptions or where the name and/or quantity of the controlled substances is not specified or where the name of the ultimate user is missing.

The pharmacist shall also indicate the change on the prescription and initial the change. (n) When a pharmacist fills a prescription in a manner that would require, under subdivision (l) or (m) of this section, the pharmacist to make a notation on the prescription if the prescription were written, the pharmacist shall make the same notation electronically when filling an electronic prescription and retain the annotation electronically in the prescription record. (o) When a practitioner is notified that an electronic prescription was not successfully delivered, the practitioner shall ensure that any written or oral prescription issued as a replacement of the original electronic prescription indicates that the prescription was originally transmitted electronically, shall indicate which pharmacy the prescription was originally transmitted to, and that the transmission failed. (p) If the content of any of the information required by this Part for a controlled substance prescription is altered during the transmission of an electronic prescription, the prescription is deemed to be invalid and the pharmacy may not dispense the controlled substance.
