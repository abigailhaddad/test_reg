Codes R. & Regs. tit. 12, Appendices, app F-3\n\nState Regulations\nLARGE CARPETS AND RUGS\nStandard for the Surface Flammability of Large Carpets and\n\nRugs\n(DOC FF 1-70, issued by the U.S. Secretary of Commerce.).1\n\nDefinitions..2\n\nScope and Application..3\n\nGeneral Requirements..4\n\nTest Procedure..5\n\nLabeling..1\n\nDefinitions. In addition to the\ndefinitions given in section 2 of the Flammable Fabrics Act, as amended (sec. 1, 81 Stat. 568; 15\nU.S.C. 1191\n), and §7.2 of the Procedures\n(33 F.R. 14642, Oct. 1, 1968), the following definitions apply for the purposes\nof this Standard: (a) \"Acceptance Criterion\"\nmeans that at least seven out of eight individual specimens of a given carpet\nor rug shall meet the test criterion as defined in this Standard: (b) \"Test Criterion\" means the basis for\njudging whether or not a single specimen of carpet or rug has passed the test\ni.e., the charred portion of a tested specimen shall not extend to within 2.54\ncm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame at any\npoint. (c) \"Carpet\" means any type\nof finished product made in whole or in part of fabric or related material and\nintended for use or which may reasonably be expected to be used as a floor\ncovering which is exposed to traffic in homes, offices, or other places of\nassembly or accommodation, and which may or may not be fastened to the floor by\nmechanical means such as nails, tacks, barbs, staples, adhesives, and which has\none dimension greater than 1.83 m. (6 ft.) and a surface area greater than 2.23\nm. 2 (24 sq. ft.). Products such as \"carpet squares\", with one dimension less\nthan 1.83 m. (6 ft.) and a surface area less than 2.23 m. 2 (24 sq. ft.), but\nintended to be assembled upon installation into assemblies which may have one\ndimension greater than 1.83 m. (6 ft.) and a surface area greater than 2.23 m. 2 (24 sq. ft.), are included in this definition. Mats, hides with natural or\nsynthetic fibers, and other similar products in the above defined dimensions\nare included in this definition, but resilient floor coverings such as\nlinoleum, asphalt tile and vinyl tile are not. (d) \"Rug\" means the same as carpet and shall\nbe accepted as interchangeable with carpet. (e) \"Traffic Surface\" means a surface of a\ncarpet or rug which is intended to be walked upon. (f) \"Timed Burning Tablet\" (pill) means the\nmethenamine tablet, weighing approximately 0.149 gram (2.30 grains), sold as\n\nProduct No. 1588 in Catalog No. 79, December 1, 1969, by the Eli Lilly Company\nof Indianapolis, Ind. 46206, or an equal tablet. (g) \"Fire-Retardant Treatment\" means any\nprocess to which a carpet or rug has been exposed which significantly decreases\nthe flammability of that carpet or rug and enables it to meet the acceptance\ncriterion of this Standard..2\n\nScope and application. This Standard\nprovides a test method to determine the surface flammability of carpets and\nrugs when exposed to a standard small source of ignition under carefully\nprescribed draft-protected conditions. It is applicable to all types of carpets\nand rugs used as floor covering materials regardless of their method of\nfabrication or whether they are made of natural or synthetic fibers or films, or combinations of or substitutes for these. One of a kind, carpet or rug, such as an antique, an Oriental, or a hide, may be excluded from testing under this Standard pursuant to\nconditions established by the Federal Trade Commission..3\n\nGeneral requirements--\n(a) Summary of test method. This method\ninvolves the exposure of each of eight conditioned, replicate specimens of a\ngiven carpet or rug to a standard igniting source in a draft-protected\nenvironment, and measurement of the proximity of the charred portion to the\nedge of the hole in the prescribed flattening frame. (b) Test criterion. A specimen passes the\ntest if the charred portion does not extend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the\nedge of the hole in the flattening frame at any point. (c) Acceptance criterion. At least seven of\nthe eight specimens shall meet the test criterion in order to conform with this\n\nStandard..4\n\nTest\nprocedure--\n(a) Apparatus --\n(1)\n\nTest chamber. The test chamber shall\nconsist of an open top hollow cube made of noncombustible material[FN1] with\ninside dimensions 30.48 x 30.48 x 30.48 cm. (12 x 12 x 12 in.) and a minimum of\n6.35 mm. (1/4 in.) wall 1 thickness. The flat bottom of the box shall be made\nof the same material as the sides and shall be easily removable. The sides\nshall be fastened together with screws or brackets and taped to prevent air\nleakage into the box during use. NOTE: A minimum of two chambers and two extra bottoms is\nsuggested for efficient operation. (2)\n\nFlattening frame. A steel plate, 22.86 x\n22.86 cm. (9 x 9 in.), 6.35 mm. ( 1/4 in.) thick with a 20.32 cm. (8 in.)\ndiameter hole in its center is required to hold the carpet or rug flat during\nthe course of the test. It is recommended that one be provided for each test\nchamber. (3)\n\nStandard igniting\nsource. No. 1588 methenamine timed burning tablet or an equal tablet. These\ntablets shall be stored in a desiccator over a desiccant for 24 hours prior to\nuse. (Small quantities of sorbed water may cause the tablets to fracture when\nfirst ignited. If a major fracture occurs, any results from that test shall be\nignored, and it shall be repeated.)\n(4)\n\nTest specimens. Each test specimen shall\nbe a 22.86 x 22.86 cm. (9 x 9 in.) section of the carpet or rug to be tested. Eight specimens are required. (5)\n\nCirculating air oven. A forced circulation drying oven capable of removing the\nmoisture from the specimens when maintained at 105° c. (221° F.) for 2\nhours. [FN2]\n(6)\n\nDesiccating\ncabinet. An airtight and moisturetight cabinet capable of holding the floor\ncovering specimens horizontally without contacting each other during the\ncooling period following drying, and containing silica gel desiccant. (7)\n\nGloves. Nonhygroscopic gloves (such as\nrubber polyethylene) for handling the sample after drying, and raising the pile\non specimens prior to testing. (8)\n\nHood. A hood capable of being closed and having its draft turned off during\neach test and capable of rapidly removing the products of combustion following\neach test. The front or sides of the hood should be transparent to permit\nobservation of the tests in progress. (9)\n\nMirror. A small mirror mounted above each\ntest chamber at an angle to permit observation of the specimen from outside of\nthe hood. (10)\n\nVacuum cleaner. A\nvacuum cleaner to remove all loose material from each specimen prior to\nconditioning All surfaces of the vacuum cleaner contacting the specimen shall\nbe flat and smooth. (b) Sampling--\n(1)\n\nSelection of samples. Select a\nsample of the material representative of the lot and large enough to permit\ncutting eight test specimens 22.86 x 22.86 cm. (9 x 9 in.), free from creases, fold marks, delaminations, or other distortions. The test specimens should\ncontain the most flammable parts of the traffic surface at their centers. The\nmost flammable area may be determined on the basis of experience or through\npretesting. If the carpet or rug has had a fire-retardant treatment, or is\nmade of fibers which have had a fire-retardant treatment, the selected sample\nor oversized specimens thereof shall be washed, prior to cutting of test\nspecimens either 10 times under the washing and drying procedure prescribed in\n\nMethod 124-1967 of the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists\n[washing procedure 6.2(III) with a water temperature of 60° +- 2.8° C. (140° +- 5° F.), drying procedure 6.3.2(B), maximum load 8.64 kg. (8\npounds),] [FN3] or such number of times under such other washing and drying\nprocedure as shall previously have been found to be equivalent by the Federal\n\nTrade Commission. Alternatively, the selected sample or oversized specimens\nthereof may be washed, drycleaned, or shampooed 10 times, prior to cutting of\ntest specimens, in such manner as the manufacturer or other interested party\nshall previously have established to the satisfaction of the Federal Trade\n\nCommission is normally used for that type of carpet or rug in service. (2)\n\nCutting. Cut eight 22.86 +- 0.64 cm. (9\n+- 1/4 in.) square specimens of each carpet or rug to be tested to comply with\nsection.4(b)(1). (c) Conditioning. Clean each specimen with the vacuum cleaner until it is free of\nall loose ends left during the manufacturing process and from any material that\nmay have been worked into the pile during handling. [FN4] Care must be\nexercised to avoid \"fuzzing\" of the pile yarn. Place the specimens in the drying oven in a manner that will\npermit free circulation of the air at 105° C. (221° F.) around them for\n2 hours. [FN5] Remove the specimens from the oven with gloved hands and place\nthem horizontally in the desiccator with traffic surface up and free from\ncontact with each other until cooled to room temperature, but in no instance\nless than 1 hour. (d) Testing. Place the test chamber in the draft-protected environment (hood with\ndraft off) with its bottom in place. Wearing gloves, remove a test specimen\nfrom the desiccator and brush its surface with a gloved hand in such a manner\nas to raise its pile, Place the specimen on the center of the floor of the test\nchamber, traffic surface up, exercising care that the specimen is horizontal\nand flat. Place the flattening frame on the specimen and position a methenamine\ntablet on one of its flat sides in the center of the 20.32 cm. (8 in.) hole. Ignite the tablet by touching a lighted match or an equivalent\nigniting source carefully to its top. If more than 2 minutes elapse between the\nremoval of the specimen from the desiccator and the ignition of the tablet, the\nconditioning must be repeated. Continue each test until one of the following conditions\noccurs: (1)\n\nThe last vestige of flame\nor glow disappears. (This is frequently accompanied by a final puff of\nsmoke.)\n(2)\n\nThe flaming or\nsmoldering has approached within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in\nthe flattening frame at any point. When all combustion has ceased, ventilate the hood and measure\nthe shortest distance between the edge of the hole in the flattening frame and\nthe charred area. Record the distance measured for each specimen. Remove the specimen from the chamber and remove any burn\nresidue from the floor of the chamber. Before proceeding to the next test, the\nfloor must be cooled to normal room temperature or replaced with one that is at\nnormal room temperature. (e) Report. The number of specimens of the\neight tested in which the charred area does not extend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0\nin.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame shall be\nreported. (f) Interpretation of\nresults. If the charred area does not extend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of\nthe edge of the hole in the flattening frame at any point for at least seven of\nthe eight specimens, the carpet or rug meets the acceptance criterion..5\n\nLabeling. If the\ncarpet or rug has had a fire-retardant treatment or is made of fibers which\nhave had a fire-retardant treatment, it shall be labeled with the letter \"T\"\npursuant to conditions established by the Federal Trade Commission. [F.R. Doc. 70-4657; Filed, Apr. 15, 1970; 8:50 a.m.]\n[FN1] 6.35 mm. (1/4 in.) cement asbestos board is a suitable\nmaterial.
