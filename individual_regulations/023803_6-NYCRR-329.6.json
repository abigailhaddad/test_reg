  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 329.6 - Authorized chemicals and specifications\n\nState Regulations\n\nBased on available information, the chemicals or pesticides\nto be applied to the waters of the State, as well as the dosages and the\nmethods of application, are those indicated to be best in respect to safety of\nnon-target organisms, accumulation in tissues and persistence in the\nenvironment. (a) Control of\nmosquito larvae (flowing streams and open waters of ponds and lakes containing\nfish are not to be treated). (1)\n\nFor\nthe individual on his own or leased property. Chemical\n\nSpray Mixture\n\nDosage\n\nApplication\n\nAreas to be\n\nTreated\n\nMethoxychlor (emulsifiable concentrate 25%)\n(4 teaspoons per quart of water\n1/2 ounce (4 teaspoons) of mixture per 100 sq. ft. surface or proportional\n\nApply with \"flit gun\" or small atomizing sprayer\ncontaining no more than needed for the surface treated\n\nTemporary or permanent ponds without outlet to other\nwaters and containing no fish, or to similar small swampy areas containing\nwater\n\nPyrethrins (If 0.1 or 0.2% pyrethrins) (If 20%\nconcentrate)\n\nUndiluted\n1 ounce (2 tablespoons of either mixture to 100 sq. ft.of surface\n\nAs above\n\nAs above and may also be applied to weedy\nmargins of ponds containing fish when found to harbor larvae. This type of area\nmay be treated even when pond drains to other waters\n\nUse 1/2 teaspoon to 1 quart of kerosene\n\nOil (kerosene or #2 fuel oil) Note that a new oil\n\"flit MLO\" is nonphytotoxic and is effective at lower dosage\n\nUndiluted\n3 ounces (6 tablespoons) oil per 100 sq. ft. of\nsurface or proportional\n\nAs above\n\nTemporary or permanent ponds not\ncontaining fish, without outlet to other waters if browning or destruction of\nvegetation will not be objectionable. Localized areas of heavy vegetation on\nmargins of ponds which contain fish may also be treated\n\nIf available, use undiluted\n3/4 oz. (6 teaspoons) per 100 sq. ft. As above\n(2)\n\nLarge scale treatments (community, town, county, etc.). Chemical\n\nSpray Mixture\n\nDosage\n\nApplication\n\nAreas to be\n\nTreated\n\nMethoxychlor (emulsifiable concentrate, oil\nsolutions, wettable powders, or granulated formulations)\n\nDilution based on delivery rate of equipment\n\nNot to exceed 0.2 lb/acre (active ingredient)\n\nPositive pressure aircraft spray; large mechanical\nsprayers, or for small areas not readily reached, hand or canister sprayers-\ncalibrated for exact delivery\n\nTemporary or permanent ponds and swamps and marshes\nnot containing fish and without outlet to other waters\n\nMalathion (emulsifiable concentrate)\n\nAs above\n\nNot to exceed 0.5 lb/acre (active ingredient)\n\nAs above\n\nAs above\n\nAbate (4 lb/gal emulsifiable concentrate)\n\nAs above\n0.5 ounce (of formulation) per acre usually to 1.5\nounce per acre in presence of high organic pollution. As above-general even distribution to water\nsurface\n\nAs above. At the dosage used not too toxic to fish in\nfresh waters, so small amount of drainage to other waters may be tolerated\n\nGranular- 1% on sand\n\nAs obtained\n\nNot to exceed 5 lb/acre\n\nCalibrated spreader\n\nGranular- 1% on sand\n\nAs obtained\n\nNot to exceed 21/2 lb/acre of formulation\n\nSame\n\nFlit MLO\nUndiluted\n21/2 gallons per acre\n\nCalibrated hydraulic hand or power sprayers (not to\nexceed 30 p.s.i.)\n\nAny water where phytotoxicity is a problem and\nmarshes, swamps with outlet to other water and weedy margins of ponds and lakes\ncontaining fish\n#2 fuel oil plus 3-5% wetting agent such as Triton B\n1956, Nopco 1216 or Amine 230X\nUndiluted\n5-10 gal/acre if unpolluted, little vegetation. 20-50\ngallons/acre, if heavily polluted, vegetated\n\nCalibrated mechanical sprayer\n\nCatch basins, dumps and sumps\n(b) Blackfly larvicide\napplications. (1)\n\nUsually the holdings\nof an individual property owner are too small to gain any effective control by\ntreatment of waters on his property. Black flies are reported to fly several\nmiles and treatment of a stream must involve the treatment of the headwaters\nfor the best effect. Airplane application is the only method of treatment that\nis authorized. If the individual's holdings are extensive enough to constitute\na large-scale operation, a permit may be issued according to paragraph\n(2). (2)\n\nLarge scale\noperations (associations, municipality, governmental agency, etc.). (If area for which permit is requested is too small, or incomplete, for\neffective control, the permit may not be granted.)\n\nChemical\n\nSpray Mixture\n\nDosage\n\nApplication\n\nAreas to be\n\nTreated\n\nMethoxychlor oil solution plus 0.5-0.75% emulsifier\nsuch as Triton X 100 in finished formulation\n\nUsually one gallon 15% methoxychlor per flight\nmile\n\nNot to exceed.075 lbs per swath acre of active\ningredient\n\nPositive pressure air-craft spray only. Approximately\n100 ft. swaths, spaced 1/4 mile between centers, to cross streams at\napproximately right angles\n\nAll streams in spray area. Except for the outlets, direct spraying of lakes and ponds should be avoided\n\nNote: Aircraft operators\nshould hold an agricultural aircraft operator's certificate from the Federal\n\nAeronautics Agency and also a State license as custom applicator as soon as the\n\nState regulations are in effect. Aircraft must also be certificated and\nproperly equipped according to the Federal Aeronautaics Agency\nregulations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n329.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
