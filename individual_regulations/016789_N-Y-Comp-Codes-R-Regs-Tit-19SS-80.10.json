  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19§ 80.10 - Intent\n\nState Regulations\n\nIt is the intent of the department to ensure that information\nregarding approved real estate courses will be readily available to licensed\nreal estate brokers and salespeople, who are required to attend approved\ncourses as a condition to continued licensure pursuant to article 12-A of the\n\nReal Property Law. The Legislature has expressed, through amendments to such\nlaw, a strong public policy that such licensees remain knowledgeable about\ncurrent laws and practices bearing on the real estate brokerage business. To\nfurther effectuate this policy, the department will prepare lists described in\nsection\n80.11\nof this Part, to be\navailable pursuant to this Part. The information contained in the lists will be\nlimited to that already generally available in the public domain by virtue of\nits nature and of the dissemination of information on lists released pursuant\nto court order in New York State Association of Realtors, Inc. v. Paterson, No. 4514-81 (Supreme Court, Albany County, July 20, 1981). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 19§\n80.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
