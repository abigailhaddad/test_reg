(f) Each inmate shall undergo a screening and\nrisk assessment, including a review of medical records, prior to being assigned\nto a double occupancy housing unit originally designated for individual\noccupancy. Only those inmates determined by the department to be suitable shall\nbe assigned to double occupancy housing units originally designated for\nindividual occupancy.
