  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 360-2.2 - Applying for MA\nState Regulations\n(a) ADC and HR applicants. Persons applying for ADC or HR on the State-prescribed\nform are not required to make a separate application for MA. (1)\n\nPersons determined to be eligible for ADC\nor HR are automatically eligible for MA if they meet the general conditions for\nMA eligibility in section\n360-3.2\nof this Part. (2)\n\nPersons determined to be ineligible for\nADC or HR will have their MA eligibility determined separately, unless they\nhave stated in writing that they do not want their MA eligibility\ndetermined. (b) SSI applicants. (1)\n\nPersons\ndetermined to be eligible for SSI from the Social Security Administration are\nautomatically eligible for MA if they meet the general conditions for MA\neligibility in section\n360-3.2\nof this Part. No separate\napplication for MA is required. (2)\n\nPersons determined to be ineligible for SSI must make a separate application if\nthey wish to have MA eligibility determined, assuming they have not already\ndone so. (c) Title\nIV-E children. (1)\nA child receiving\nfoster care maintenance payments pursuant to title IV-E of the Social Security\n\nAct or on whose behalf a title IV-E adoption assistance agreement is in effect\nis automatically eligible for MA. The child must be living in the state and\nmeet the general conditions of MA eligibility in section\n360-3.2\nof this Part. No separate\napplication for MA is required. (2)\n\nIf a child is determined ineligible under title IV-E, a separate application\nmust be made in order to have MA eligibility determined, assuming this has not\nalready been done. (d) Application for MA only. (1)\n\nPersons may apply for MA without applying for ADC, HR, or SSI. Persons may also\napply for MA separately from an application for SSI. Such applicants must\ncomplete and sign a State-prescribed form in ink. Spouses living together and\napplying for MA together must both sign the State-prescribed application form. The form may be completed and signed by anyone the applicant designates to\nrepresent him/her in the application process. The completed form must be\nreturned to the social services district in the county in which the applicant\nlives. (2)\n(i) HR eligibility will be determined for MA\napplicants who: (a) are not eligible under\nthe assistance programs listed in section\n360-3.3\n(a)(2)-(6)\nof this Part; and\n(b) do not meet\nthe requirements, other than financial, for medically needy status in section\n360-3.3\n(b) of\nthis Part. (ii)\n\nGenerally, eligibility for MA on the basis of HR eligibility will be determined\naccording to Parts 352 and 370 of this Title. Exceptions to this general rule\nare set forth below. (a) A homestead, as\ndefined in section\n360-1.4\n(f) of\nthis Part, is exempt from consideration in determining eligibility. (b) Lump-sum and windfall payments will be\ncounted as income in the month received. Any portion of such payments remaining\nin subsequent months will be counted as an available resource. (c) A child's savings account of under $500\naccumulated from gifts from nonlegally responsible relatives or from the\nchild's own wages will be disregarded in determining eligibility. (d) The provisions of section\n352.23\n(b)(6)\nof\nthis Title regarding the sale of real property do not apply. If the value of\nthe total resources of the applicant/recipient is over the maximum resource\nlevel, the applicant/recipient will be ineligible for MA. (e) Recertification. Social Services districts must redetermine an MA\nrecipient's eligibility at least once every 12 months and whenever there is a\nchange in the recipient's circumstances that may affect eligibility. The\ndistrict may redetermine eligibility more frequently. (1)\nMA recipients who are not eligible for\nADC, HR, SSI, title IV-E, or the adoption assistance benefits described in\nsection\n360-3.3\n(a)(6)\nof\nthis Part must apply for recertification on a State-prescribed form each time\nMA eligibility is redetermined. (2)\nMA recipients who are eligible for ADC, HR, SSI, title IV-E, or the adoption\nassistance benefits described in section\n360-3.3\n(a)(6)\nof\nthis Part will continue to be eligible for MA as long as they are eligible\nunder the other program. No application for recertification is required when MA\neligibility is redetermined. (f) Personal interview for applicants\nand recipients. (1)\n\nThe social services\ndistrict must conduct a personal interview with anyone applying for MA or for\nrecertification of MA, except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this\nsubdivision. If the applicant/recipient cannot be interviewed due to his/her\nphysical or mental condition, the person who applied on his/her behalf must be\ninterviewed. The district must conduct the interview before making any decision\nconcerning an applicant's/recipient's eligibility for MA. The district does not\nhave to conduct a personal interview when the application for MA is made on\nbehalf of a child in the custody of the State Division for Youth or of a local\ncommissioner of social services. At the interview, an applicant/recipient or\nhis/her representative must be told about the following: (i) the general eligibility requirements of\nthe MA program; (ii)\nthe\napplicant's/recipient's responsibility to provide all information necessary to\ndetermine eligibility; (iii)\nthe\napplicant's/recipient's and the social services district's responsibility to\nexplore all the facts concerning the applicant's/recipient's\neligibility; (iv)\nthe kinds of\ninformation or documents the applicant/recipient must provide to show\neligibility, the time when the information and documents must be submitted, and\nthe applicant's/recipient's responsibility to obtain information or documents\nwhenever possible; (v) the social\nservices district's responsibility to undertake necessary investigation to\ndetermine the applicant's/recipient's eligibility; (vi)\nthe applicant's/recipient's\nresponsibility to inform the district immediately of all changes in\ncircumstances; and\n(vii)\nthe\navailability of other assistance or services for which the applicant/recipient\nmay be eligible. (2)\n(i) Social services districts may request a\nwaiver of the personal interview requirement for recertification for aged, certified blind or certified disabled recipients. The request must be sent in\nwriting, by certified mail, to the State Commissioner of Social Services. The\nrequest must state the intended duration of the waiver and other conditions the\nlocal social services commissioner finds relevant. The local social services\ncommissioner must sign the request. A waiver request may be granted if the\nsocial services district demonstrates that alternative procedures have been\nestablished to verify that recipients continue to meet all eligibility\nrequirements for MA. The department may require follow-up reports from the\nsocial services district to insure that continuing eligibility is being\naccurately determined. The waiver may be withdrawn or modified, if, through the\ndepartment's monitoring efforts, it is determined that the statewide medical\nassistance eligibility error rate may be adversely affected. (ii)\n\nThe local social services official will\nbe notified in writing within 45 days of the approval, partial approval or\ndenial of the waiver. If the waiver is denied, the department will inform the\ndistrict of the reasons for the denial. The department's failure to act within\nthe specified time period does not constitute an automatic approval of the\nwaiver. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
