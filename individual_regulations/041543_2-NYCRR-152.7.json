Tit. 2 § 152.7 - Service credit\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\nambulance company for which a service award program is adopted shall maintain\nat all times for each volunteer ambulance worker of the company, whether or not\na participant in the program, a record of the activities performed and points\ngranted toward a year of ambulance service credit. (b) On or before March 31st of each year, each ambulance company for which a service award program is adopted shall\nprepare and submit to the governing board of the sponsor a list of all the\nvolunteer ambulance workers of the company which identifies all those who have\nearned credit for a year of ambulance service during the preceding calendar\nyear. Such list shall be certified under oath by the president, secretary and\nchief or comparable officers of the ambulance company and shall be accompanied\nby such membership records or records of point accumulations as the governing\nboard may require to substantiate the accuracy of the list. Such list shall\nalso identify those volunteer ambulance workers who have waived participation\nin the service award program as provided in subdivision (g) of this\nsection. (c) On or before May 1st\nof each year, the governing board of the sponsor shall review each such\ncertified list and may delete the name of any person who was not a volunteer\nambulance worker during the proceeding calendar year or disallow the service\ncredit of any volunteer ambulance worker who did not earn 50 points during the\nproceeding calendar year or whose point accumulation has not been adequately\ndocumented. Thereafter, the governing board shall approve each such certified\nlist of volunteer ambulance workers and each volunteer ambulance worker thereon\nidentified as having earned 50 or more points during the preceding calendar\nyear shall be credited with a year of ambulance service. Upon approval, the\ngoverning board shall cause a copy of each list to be returned the appropriate\nambulance company and each ambulance company shall, immediately upon receipt, post the list in a conspicuous place at its principal headquarters for at least\n30 days and maintain a record of the date on which the list is\nposted. (d) Not later than 30 days\nafter the approved list is posted by the ambulance company, any volunteer\nambulance worker whose name does not appear on the list as having earned credit\nfor a year of ambulance service may appeal to the governing board of the\nsponsor to have his or her name added to the list as having earned credit for a\nyear of ambulance service. The appeal shall be in writing and mailed to the\nclerk or secretary of the governing board of the sponsor. The governing board\nshall investigate all appeals and upon finding that such a volunteer ambulance\nworker has earned a year of ambulance service credit for the preceding calendar\nyear, shall order the volunteer ambulance worker to be identified as having\nearned a year of ambulance service credit on the approved list. (e) On or before July 1st of each year, the\ngoverning board of the sponsor shall cause a certified copy of the approved\nlist to be filed with the administrator accompanied by appropriate\ndocumentation supporting any changes to the list made pursuant to subdivision\n(d) of this section. (f) The\nadministrator shall retain such list and shall promptly forward a copy of such\nlist to the program actuary. (g) Any volunteer ambulance worker not wishing to participate in the service award\nprogram may waive participation by filing with the chief executive officer of\nthe ambulance company, the chief executive officer of the political subdivision\nand the administrator a written notice of waiver of participation. Such waiver\nshall remain effective until withdrawn in the same manner. During the period\nsuch a waiver remains effective, a volunteer ambulance worker shall not earn\nservice credit, nor be entitled to a distribution from the program. (h) If the effective date as of which a\nvolunteer ambulance worker (or the volunteer ambulance worker's beneficiary, if\nthe volunteer ambulance worker is deceased) begins to be paid a service award\nis other than the last day of a calendar year, the volunteer ambulance worker\nshall have the opportunity to earn service credit (i.e., points under the point\nsystem) up to the day immediately preceding the effective date as of which the\nservice award payments commence. When preparing this list described in\nsubdivision (b) of this section, only activities performed by a volunteer\nambulance worker up to the day immediately preceding the effective date as of\nwhich service award payments commenced to the volunteer shall be considered\nwhen determining whether the volunteer earned 50 points during the calendar\nyear in which the service award payments commenced to the volunteer. One year\nof service credit shall be awarded to a volunteer ambulance worker only if he\nor she earned 50 points for activities he or she performed up to the day\nimmediately preceding the effective date as of which the service award payments\ncommenced to the volunteer. When determining the points to be awarded to the\nvolunteer ambulance worker for participation in ambulance company responses up\nto such day, the volunteer ambulance worker must have responded to the same\nminimum number of calls for the year that all other volunteer ambulance workers\nmay be required to respond to under the point system adopted by the sponsor. Upon receipt of a certified copy of the approved list by the administrator as\nset forth in subdivision (e) of this section, the administrator shall promptly\ndirect the program trustee to begin paying the volunteer ambulance worker any\nadditional service award to which he or she may be entitled to be paid as of\nthe effective date on which service award payments commenced to the volunteer\nambulance worker.
