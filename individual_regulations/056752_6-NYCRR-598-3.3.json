  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 598-3.3 - Leak detection\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General leak detection requirements. A\nmethod, or combination of methods, of leak detection must be provided that: (1)\ncan assess the integrity and remaining\nuseful life of tank system and detect a leak from any portion of the tank and\nthe piping that are in contact with the ground and routinely contain hazardous\nsubstance; (2)\nis installed and\ncalibrated in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions; and\n(3)\nmeets the requirements of subdivisions\n(c) and (d) of this section, as applicable. In addition, the methods listed\nunder paragraphs (c)(1), (d)(1), and (d)(2) of this section must be capable of\ndetecting the leak rate or quantity specified for that method with a\nprobability of detection of 95 percent and a probability of false alarm of 5\npercent. (b) Specific\nleak detection requirements for tanks and piping. (1)\n\nTank leak detection. (i) Category 1 tanks. Category 1 tanks must, at least every five years, be inspected in accordance with paragraph (c) (3) of\nthis section. If thinning of one millimeter per year or greater occurs on the\ntank walls, or the calculated expected remaining useful life as determined by\nthe inspection is less than 10 years, then reinspection must be performed on\nthe tank at one half of the remaining useful life. (ii)\n\nCategory 2 tanks. Category 2 tanks must\nbe monitored in accordance with the following: ('a')\n\nCategory 2 tanks must, at least every\nfive years, be inspected in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. If thinning of one millimeter per year or greater occurs on the tank walls, or\nthe calculated expected remaining useful life as determined by the inspection\nis less than 10 years, then reinspection must be performed on the tank at one\nhalf of the remaining useful life; and\n('b')\n\nCategory 2 tanks must have a system for\nmonitoring leakage between the tank bottom and the secondary containment\nsystem. This may include perforated gravity collection piping or channels in a\nconcrete foundation, or other equivalent method acceptable to the department. Monitoring may be accomplished by visual, mechanical, electronic or other means\nacceptable to the department. Tanks which are entirely aboveground, such as\ntanks on racks, cradles or stilts, may be visually monitored for leakage to\nmeet this requirement. This monitoring must be performed in accordance with the\nfrequencies in subdivision\n3.2\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n\nPiping leak detection. All piping in contact with the ground must be monitored\nfor leaks at weekly intervals in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this\nsection. Additionally, all piping in contact with the ground that conveys\nhazardous substance under pressure must be equipped with an automatic line leak\ndetector that is operated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section. No leak detection is required for suction piping that is demonstrated to be\ndesigned and constructed to meet the following standards: (i) The piping operates at less than\natmospheric pressure. (ii)\n\nThe\npiping is sloped so that the contents of the pipe will drain back into the tank\nif the suction is released. (iii)\n\nOnly one check valve is included in each suction line. (iv)\n\nThe check valve is located directly\nbelow and as close as practicable to the suction\npump. (c) Tank\nleak detection methods. Tank leak detection methods used to meet the\nrequirements of paragraph (b) (1) of this section must be conducted in\naccordance with the following: (1)\n\nTank\ntightness testing. (i) A tightness test is a\ntest acceptable to the department which will determine if a tank and piping\nsystem is tight or not tight. This shall include: ('a')\na test capable of detecting a tank leak\nof one tenth gallons per hour (gph) with a probability of detection of 95\npercent and probability of false alarm of five percent or less with a maximum\nthreshold for declaring a leak of five hundredths of a gallon in one hour\naccounting for variables such as vapor pockets, thermal expansion and\ncontraction of product, temperature stratification, groundwater level, evaporation, pressure and tank deformation; or\n('b')\na structural inspection performed in\naccordance with the requirements of paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nIf it\nis technically impossible to perform a meaningful tightness test, then an\nalternative test or inspection which is acceptable to the department must be\nperformed. (iii)\n\nQualification of\ntechnicians. All tightness tests must be performed by a qualified technician\nwho has an understanding of the variables which affect the test and is trained\nby the manufacturer or their representative to perform the\ntest. (2)\n\nInterstitial\nmonitoring. Interstitial monitoring between the primary and secondary\ncontainment may be used if the monitoring equipment is designed, constructed\nand installed to detect a leak from any portion of the tank that routinely\ncontains hazardous substance, and if the monitoring equipment meets the\nrequirements of either subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph: (i) For a double-walled tank or double-walled\npiping, the sampling or testing method: ('a')\ncan detect a leak through the inner wall in any portion of the tank and/or\npiping that routinely contains hazardous substance; and\n('b')\nis capable of detecting a breach in\nboth the inner and outer walls of the tank and/or piping if using continuous\nvacuum, pressure, or liquid-filled methods of interstitial\nmonitoring. (ii)\n\nFor an\nAST system with secondary containment within the excavation zone, the sampling\nor testing method can detect a leak between the primary and secondary\ncontainment, and the following conditions are met: ('a')\n\nThe secondary containment consists of\nartificially constructed material that is sufficiently thick and impermeable\n(i.e., with a permeability rate to water equal to or less than 1'10-6 cm/sec)\nto direct a leak to the monitoring point and permit its detection. ('b')\n\nThe secondary containment is compatible\nwith the hazardous substance stored so that a leak from the AST system will not\ncause a deterioration of the secondary containment, allowing a leak to pass\nthrough undetected. ('c')\n\nFor\ncathodically protected tank systems the secondary containment must be installed\nso that it does not interfere with the proper operation of the cathodic\nprotection system. ('d')\n\nThe\ngroundwater, soil moisture, or rainfall will not render the testing or sampling\nmethod inoperative so that a leak could go undetected for more than seven\ndays. ('e')\n\nThe site is assessed to\nensure that the secondary containment is always above the groundwater and not\nin a 25-year flood plain, unless the secondary containment and monitoring\ndesigns are for use under such conditions. ('f')\n\nMonitoring wells must be protected from\ntraffic, permanently labeled as a 'monitoring well' or 'test well-no fill' and\nequipped with a locking cap which must be locked when not in use to prevent\nunauthorized access and tampering. (3)\n\nFive-year inspections. (i) The owner or operator must inspect the\naboveground tank system. The inspection must be consistent with a consensus\ncode, standard or practice, and be developed by a nationally recognized\nassociation or independent testing laboratory and meet the specifications of\nthis paragraph. If no consensus code, standard, or practice is applicable to\nthe tank system, a method otherwise approved by the department must be used. The inspection must consist of the following: ('a')\na calculated useful remaining life of\nthe tank. The calculated useful remaining life of the tank may not exceed the\nuseful life as determined by the manufacturer; ('b')\na determination of tank system\ntightness in accordance with paragraphs (c)(1) and (d)(2) of this\nsection; ('c')\nan evaluation on\nstructural soundness of the tank system; ('d')\nan assessment of tank system corrosion, wear, and operability; and\n('e')\nan\nevaluation on foundation strength. (ii)\n\nFor aboveground ancillary equipment, the\ninspection must consist of the following: ('a')\nexamination of exposed piping, joints, welds and connections for misalignment and tightness. Insulated piping systems\nmust have the covering removed if there is evidence of a leak such as damage or\ndiscoloration of the insulating material or the presence of free liquid. Representative flanged connections must be examined for gasket deterioration\nand misalignment; ('b')\nstructural\ninspection of representative sections of pipes for thinning, galvanic\ncorrosion, intergranular corrosion, stress corrosion cracking, crevice\ncorrosion, pitting, and for evidence of coating failure and material\nincompatibility. Galvanic cells, such as may be created by the joining of\ndissimilar metals, and other sources of corrosion must be identified; ('c')\na tightness test of any connecting\npiping in contact with the ground in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this\nsection; ('d')\ninspection and\nassessment of all ancillary equipment such as gauges, pressure/vacuum safety\nvalves, safety interlocks, flow valves and pumps for adequacy, operability, leakage, fouling, corrosion, scaling and wear. Relief valves must be tested for capacity or opening and\nreseating pressure and inspected to see if corrosion, fouling or scaling has\noccurred; and\n('e')\nan\nidentification of system deficiencies which may result in a leak due to\nvibration, expansion, contraction, frost, settlement, shock or other\ncauses. (iii)\n\nFor tanks\nwith a capacity of 10,000 gallons or more, the inspection must be conducted\nunder the direction of a qualified engineer. The engineer must certify that the\ntank is structurally sound and is not subject to external or internal corrosion\nthat may result in a release before the next inspection and re-certification. Where necessary, the inspection must be made of all accessible tank surfaces\nand, where applicable, include the following: ('a')\ncleaning the tank and\ndifficult-to-reach areas within the tank in accordance with a consensus code, standard or practice developed by a nationally recognized association or\nindependent testing laboratory; ('b')\nremoval, transportation and disposal of\nsolid precipitates or accumulated sludge in compliance with all applicable\n\nState, Federal and local laws; ('c')\ninspecting the tank, both internally\nand externally, for structural soundness and testing of the welds and seams on\nthe tank bottom for porosity and tightness. The inspector may use one or more\nof the following nondestructive testing methods: hydrostatic or vacuum test; a\ndye penetrant test; an ultrasonic test; a radiographic or X-ray test; a\nmagnetic particle inspection; or any other equivalent test which determines\nwhether the tank is structurally sound. This must include measurements of\nerosion and corrosion wear and assessments of galvanic corrosion, intergranular\ncorrosion, stress corrosion cracking, device corrosion, pitting, cellular\ncorrosion and inspection for material incompatibility; ('d')\nvisual inspection of the internal\nsurfaces of the tank and difficult-to-reach areas for corrosion or failure; and\n('e')\ninspection of internal\nand external liners, cladding and coatings for any signs of failure such as\ncracks, bubbles, blisters, peeling, curling or separation. (d) Piping leak\ndetection methods. Piping leak detection methods used to meet the requirements\nof paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be conducted in accordance with the\nfollowing: (1)\n\nAutomatic line leak detectors. Methods which indicate the presence of a leak by restricting or shutting off\nthe flow of hazardous substance through piping, or triggering an audible or\nvisual alarm, may be used only if they detect leaks of 3 gallons per hour at 10\npounds per square inch line pressure within one hour. (2)\n\nLine tightness testing. (i) A tightness test is a test acceptable to\nthe department which will determine if a tank and piping system is tight or not\ntight. This shall include: ('a')\na test\ncapable of detecting a piping leak of one tenth gallons per hour (gph) with a\nprobability of detection of 95 percent and probability of false alarm of five\npercent or less with a maximum threshold for declaring a leak of five\nhundredths of a gallon in one hour accounting for variables such as vapor\npockets, thermal expansion and contraction of product, temperature\nstratification, groundwater level, evaporation, pressure and tank deformation; or\n('b')\na structural inspection\nperformed in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nIf it is\ntechnically impossible to perform a meaningful tightness test, then an\nalternative test or inspection which is acceptable to the department must be\nperformed. (iii)\n\nQualification of\ntechnicians. All tightness tests must be performed by a qualified technician\nwho has an understanding of the variables which affect the test and is trained\nby the manufacturer or their representative to perform the\ntest. (e) Recordkeeping. Records of the tests and inspections required by this section\nmust meet the following requirements: (1)\n\nThe\nresults of five-year inspections must be retained for 10 years. (2)\n\nThe results of tank and line tightness\ntesting must be retained for three years or until the next test, whichever is\nlater, and include the following information: (i) facility registration number; (ii)\ntank system identification number as\nshown on the registration certificate for the tank or piping tested; (iii)\ndate of test; (iv)\nresults of test; (v) test method; (vi)\ncertification by the technician that the\ntest complies with paragraph (c)(1) or paragraph (d)(2) of this\nsection; (vii)\nstatement of\ntechnician's qualifications; (viii)\naddress of technician; and\n(ix)\nsignature of technician. (f) Uninspected tank systems. If any portion\nof a tank system is not tested or inspected as required by this section, the\nowner or operator must take the uninspected portion of the tank system\nout-of-service pursuant to the requirements of subdivision\n3.6\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart.
