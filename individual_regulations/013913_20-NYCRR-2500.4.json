A taxpayer\nhas participated in a New York listed transaction if the taxpayer's tax return\nreflects tax consequences or a tax strategy described by notice or other form\nof published guidance that lists the transaction under section\n2500.3\n(b) of this Part. A taxpayer also has participated in a New York listed transaction\nif the taxpayer knows or has reason to know that the taxpayer's tax benefits\nare derived directly or indirectly from tax consequences or a tax strategy\ndescribed by notice or other form of published guidance that lists a\ntransaction under section\n2500.3\n(b) of this Part. A published notice or other form of guidance may identify other\ntypes or classes of persons that will be treated as participants in a New York\nlisted transaction. (2)\n\nNew York\nconfidential transactions. A taxpayer has participated in a New York\nconfidential transaction if the taxpayer's tax return reflects a tax benefit\nfrom the transaction and the taxpayer's disclosure of the tax treatment or tax\nstructure of the transaction is limited in the manner described in section\n2500.3\n(c) of this Part. If a partnership's, S corporation's or trust's disclosure is\nlimited, and the partner's, shareholder's, or beneficiary's disclosure is not\nlimited, then the partnership, S corporation, or trust, and not the partner, shareholder, or beneficiary, has participated in the New York confidential\ntransaction. (3)\n\nNew York\ntransactions with contractual protection. A taxpayer has participated in a New\n\nYork transaction with contractual protection if the taxpayer's tax return\nreflects a tax benefit from the transaction and, as described in section\n2500.3\n(d) of this Part, the taxpayer has the right to the full or partial refund of fees\nor the fees are contingent. If a partnership, S corporation, or trust has the\nright to a full or partial refund of fees or has a contingent fee arrangement, and the partner, shareholder, or beneficiary does not individually have the\nright to the refund of fees or a contingent fee arrangement, then the\npartnership, S corporation, or trust, and not the partner, shareholder, or\nbeneficiary, has participated in the New York transaction with contractual\nprotection. (4)\n\nShareholder of\nforeign corporation. A taxpayer who owns or controls, either directly or\nindirectly, more than 50 percent of the voting stock of a corporation not\nsubject to New York State tax is deemed to participate in a transaction\ndescribed in section\n2500.3\n(b), (c)\nand (d)\nof this Part if such corporation\nwould be considered to participate in the transaction under the rules of this\nsection if it were a taxpayer filing a tax return that reflects the items from\nthe transaction and the tax return of the controlling shareholder reflects a\ntax benefit from the transaction. (5)\n\nExamples. The following examples\nillustrate the provisions of this subdivision: (i) Example of participation in a New York\nconfidential transaction. XYZ is a limited liability company treated as a\npartnership for New York State tax purposes and is required to file a tax\nreturn under article 22 of the Tax Law. X, Y, and Z are members of XYZ and are\ntaxpayers for New York State purposes. X is an individual, Y is an S\ncorporation, and Z is a partnership. XYZ enters into a New York confidential\ntransaction under section\n2500.3\n(c) of this Part. X is bound by the confidentiality agreement, but Y and Z are not\nbound by the agreement. As a result of the transaction, XYZ, X, Y, and Z all\nreflect a tax benefit on their tax returns. Both XYZ's and X's disclosure of\nthe tax treatment and tax structure are limited in the manner described in\nsection\n2500.3\n(c) of this Part and their tax returns reflect a tax benefit from the transaction. Therefore, XYZ and X have participated in the New York confidential\ntransaction. Neither Y nor Z has participated in the New York confidential\ntransaction because they are not subject to the confidentiality\nagreement. (ii)\n\nExample of\nparticipation in a New York transaction with contractual protection. Corporation A is required to file a return under article 9-A of the Tax Law. Corporation A enters into a New York transaction with contractual protection\nunder section\n2500.3\n(d) of this Part. Corporation A is bound by the terms of the agreement which\noutlines potential tax consequences that may result from participation in the\ntransaction, and includes a contingent fee arrangement based on Corporation A's\nrealization of tax benefits. Corporation A has participated in the New York\ntransaction with contractual protection because its tax return reflects a tax\nbenefit from the transaction and the fee was contingent upon the tax benefit\nrealized from the transaction. Therefore, Corporation A has participated in a\n\nNew York transaction with contractual protection. (c) Substantially\nsimilar. The term\nsubstantially similar\nincludes any\ntransaction that is expected to obtain the same or similar types of tax\nconsequences and that is either factually similar or based on the same or\nsimilar tax strategy. Receipt of any written advice regarding the tax\nconsequences of the transaction is not relevant to the determination of whether\nthe transaction is the same as or substantially similar to another transaction. Further, the term substantially similar must be broadly construed in favor of\ndisclosure. (d) Tax. The term\ntax\nmeans franchise and excise\ntaxes and the tax on furnishing of utility services under article 9, business\ncorporation franchise tax under article 9-A, personal income tax under article\n22, franchise tax on banking corporations under article 32, and franchise taxes\non insurance corporations under article 33. (e) Tax benefit. A\ntax benefit\nincludes deductions, exclusions, and modifications included in gross receipts, gross earnings, income (including entire net income, gross income, New York source income, New\n\nYork adjusted gross income), gain, loss, assets, liabilities, total capital, capital stock, tax credits, nonrecognition of gain, status as an entity exempt\nfrom New York State taxation, and any other tax consequences that may reduce a\ntaxpayer's New York State's tax liability by affecting the amount, timing, character, or source of any such item, amount or activity. (f) Tax return. For purposes of this Part, the term\ntax\nreturn\nincludes original returns or reports, amended returns or\nreports and applications for credit or refund of tax. (g) Tax treatment. The\ntax treatment\nof a transaction is the\npurported or claimed New York State tax treatment of the\ntransaction. (h) Tax\nstructure.
