  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-2.6 - Investments in U. S. series F and series J bonds\n\nState Regulations\nU.S. series F bonds were issued on a discount basis of\n74 per cent of their maturity value until April 1952, at which time the U. S. Treasury replaced them by series J bonds, which are issued on a discount basis\nof 72 per cent of their maturity value. Both are basically the same type of\nsecurity and the description of the investment features and accounting\ntreatment which follows is applicable to each. (a) [Investment features.]\nNo interest, as such, is paid on the bonds, but the\nredemption values of the bonds increase at the end of the first year from the\ndate of issue and at the end of each successive semiannual period thereafter\nuntil, at maturity, the bond is redeemable at face value. The bonds are\nregistered and cannot be bought and sold on the open market but are directly\npurchased from and redeemed by the issuer, the U. S. government, through any\n\nFederal reserve bank or other authorized agencies. No commission is payable on\neither the purchase or redemption of these bonds. The bonds may be redeemed\nprior to maturity at fixed redemption values, in accordance with a table of\nredemption values appearing on each bond. Because of the sharp reduction in\nyield resulting from redemption prior to maturity, these bonds are suitable\nonly for long-term investments, such as of replacement reserve\nfunds. (b) [Accounting treatment.]\nThe bonds are charged, when purchased, to the\nappropriate investment account in the 1170 group of asset accounts. However, the procedure for recording the interest earned, which is reflected by an\nincrease in the redemption value, differs from that of other investments in two\nrespects. First, the increase in redemption value is charged to the applicable\ninvestment account so that the book value of the investment agrees with the\nredemption value, rather than to an accrued interest receivable account. The\ncredit for the increase in redemption value is to the applicable interest\nearned account. Second, the increase in redemption values is not continuous, but occurs at stated intervals, in accordance with the table of redemption\nvalues. To illustrate, the issue price of a $1,000 maturity value series F bond\nis $740. No change in the redemption value of the bond takes place until the\nend of the first year from the date of issue, when the redemption values rises\nto $742. If the issue date was May 1, 1947, no entry would be made until April\n30, 1948, when the investment account would be charged with two dollars and the\ninterest earned account credited. Thereafter, similar entries would be made at\nthe end of each six-month period to reflect the increases in redemption\nvalue. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1645-2.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
