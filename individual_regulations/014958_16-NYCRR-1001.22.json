  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.22 - Exhibit 22: terrestrial ecology and wetlands\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 22 shall contain: (a) An identification and description of the\ntype of plant communities present on the facility site, the interconnections, and adjacent properties based upon field observations and data collection\nconsistent with the nature of the site and access availability to adjacent\nproperties. (b) An analysis of the\ntemporary and permanent impact of the construction and operation of the\nfacility and the interconnections on the vegetation identified, including a\nmapped depiction of the vegetation areas showing the areas to be removed or\ndisturbed, and including a plan to identify the presence of invasive species\nand to prevent the introduction and/or spread of invasive species. (c) An identification and evaluation of\nreasonable avoidance measures or, where impacts are unavoidable, mitigation\nmeasures, including the use of alternative technologies, regarding vegetation\nimpacts identified. (d) A\ncharacterization of the facility site and any areas to be disturbed for\ninterconnections as to the vegetation, wildlife (including mammals, birds, amphibians, terrestrial invertebrates, and reptiles) and wildlife habitats, that occur in, on, or in the vicinity, based on reconnaissance or multi- season\nsurveys and data collection appropriate to the nature of the site, supplemented\nby available data from the New York Natural Heritage Program, New York State\n(NYS) Amphibian and Reptile Atlas Project, the NYS Breeding Bird Atlas and\nrange maps, Breeding Bird Survey Routes, Christmas Bird Counts and other\nsimilar reference sources, including an identification and depiction of any\n\nSignificant Coastal Fish and Wildlife Habitat Areas designated by DOS/DEC and\nany unusual habitats or significant natural communities that could support\n\nState or federally listed endangered or threatened species or species of\nspecial concern. (e) A list of the\nspecies of mammals, birds, amphibians, terrestrial invertebrates, and reptiles\nreasonably likely to occur on, or in the vicinity of the facility site and\nareas to be disturbed for interconnections based on site observations and\nsupplemented by publicly available sources. (f) An analysis of the impact of the\nconstruction and operation, including air emissions if any, of the facility and\ninterconnections on vegetation, wildlife, wildlife habitats, and wildlife\ntravel corridors, including a detailed assessment of direct and indirect\nimpacts and identification and evaluation of the expected environmental impacts\nof the facility on declining species, Species of Greatest Conservation Need\n(SGCN), and species protected by State and Federal law and the habitats of such\nspecies. Given the provisions of section\n3-0301\n(2)(r)\nof the Environmental Conservation Law\nand section\n15\nof the\n\nPublic Service Law, information that identifies the locations of habitats of\nsuch species or any other species or unique combination of species of flora or\nfauna where the destruction of such habitat or the removal of such species\nthere from would impair their ability to survive, shall not be disclosed to the\npublic, and shall only be disclosed to the parties to a proceeding pursuant to\nan appropriate protective order. (g) An identification and evaluation of\nreasonable avoidance measures or, where impacts are unavoidable, mitigation\nmeasures, including the use of alternative technologies, regarding impacts to\nvegetation, wildlife and wildlife habitat. (h) For proposed wind-powered facilities: (1)\nan identification and evaluation of the\nexpected environmental impacts of the facility on avian and bat species and the\nhabitats that support them based on information gathered during\npre-construction studies conducted at the proposed site and other nearby sites, analysis of known or predicted species and species migration corridors present\non site, and including a description of the extent, methodology and results of\nall such pre-construction studies; (2)\nan identification and description of a\nperiod of post-construction operations monitoring for potential direct and\nindirect impacts to avian and bat species and habitats, including a description\nof the extent, methodology and timing of such post-construction operations\nmonitoring; and\n(3)\na plan to avoid\nor, where unavoidable, minimize and mitigate any such impacts during\nconstruction and operation of the facility based on existing information, the\nresults of pre- and post-construction monitoring, and any known\npost-construction impacts that may occur. (i) A map showing delineated boundaries based\non on-site identification of all Federal, State and locally regulated wetlands\npresent on the facility site and within 500 feet of areas to be disturbed by\nconstruction, including the interconnections; and predicted presence and extent\nof wetlands on the remainder of site properties and adjacent properties within\n500 feet of areas to be disturbed by construction. For adjacent properties\nwithout accessibility, initial surveys may be based on remote-sensing data, interpretation of published wetlands and soils mapping and aerial\nphotography. (j) A description of\nthe characteristics of all Federal, State and locally regulated wetlands\ndelineated as above, including the Cowardin classification, and a description\nof the vegetation, soils, and hydrology data collected for each of wetland\nsites identified, based on actual on-site wetland observations. (k) A qualitative and descriptive wetland\nfunctional assessment, including seasonal variations, for all wetlands\ndelineated as above for groundwater recharge/discharge, floodflow alteration, fish and shellfish habitat, sediment/toxicant retention, nutrient removal, sediment/shoreline stabilization, wildlife habitat, recreation, uniqueness/heritage, visual quality/aesthetics, and protected species\nhabitat. (l) An analysis of all\noff-site wetlands that may be hydrologically or ecologically influenced by\ndevelopment of the facility site and the wetlands identified above, observed in\nthe field where accessible to determine their general characteristics and\nrelationship, if any, to wetlands delineated as above. (m) An identification of all temporary and\npermanent impacts on the wetlands or their regulated adjacent areas. (n) An identification and evaluation of\nreasonable avoidance measures or, where impacts are unavoidable mitigation\nmeasures to be employed regarding the wetlands and adjacent areas impacts, including the use of alternative technologies and control of potential\nphosphorus and nitrogen sources from the facility. Where appropriate, mitigation shall include plans for compensatory mitigation. Such plans shall\ncontain sections on grading, planting, and monitoring for success. (o) An identification of State and Federal\nendangered or threatened species on the facility site or that could be subject\nto impacts from facility construction, operation, or maintenance, including\nincidental takings, and an endangered or threatened species mitigation\nplan. (p) An invasive species\nprevention and management plan indicating the presence of invasive species and\nmeasures that will be implemented to minimize the introduction of new invasive\nspecies and spread of existing invasive species during soil disturbance, vegetation management, transport of materials, and\nlandscaping/revegetation. (q) An\nanalysis of the temporary and permanent impacts of the construction and\noperation of the facility and the interconnections on agricultural resources, including the acres of agricultural land temporarily impacted, the number of\nacres of agricultural land that will be permanently converted to\nnonagricultural use, and mitigation measures to minimize the impact to\nagricultural resources. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n1001.22\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
