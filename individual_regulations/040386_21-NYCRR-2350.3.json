  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 2350.3 - Policies and standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Groundwater. Nitrate-nitrogen, a contaminant which emanates\nfrom numerous types of land uses, is a recognized indicator of groundwater\nquality. Primary factors determining the concentration of nitrogen loading are\nthe area of fertilized turf and the density of dwelling units generating sewage\neffluent. The Suffolk County Department of Health Services abides by the State\nof New York nitrate-nitrogen standard for drinking water from public wells of\n10 ppm. The use of a 6 ppm standard provides a 90 percent confidence level that\nthe NYS standard of 10 ppm will not be exceeded beneath any project site. Development proposals must not exceed the nitrogen loading factor of 6 ppm on\nthe site. All development proposals must conform to article 6 of the Suffolk\n\nCounty Sanitary Code. Sewage treatment plants will be recommended for\nsubdivisions in Hydrogeologic Zones III, V, and VI where the proposed overall\ndensity is greater than 1 unit per acre and the size of the proposed\ndevelopment justifies their use. (b) Wetlands. Freshwater wetlands which exist within the Pine\n\nBarrens are considered to be an important natural resource providing for flood\nand erosion control, the filtering of contaminants and sediments from storm\nwater runoff, and the habitat for plants and wildlife. Development proposals\nwhere freshwater wetlands exist must be protected by a minimum 100 foot non-\ndisturbance buffer area (measured horizontally from the wetland edge as mapped\nby the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, field\ndelineation or local ordinance). Buffer areas shall be delineated on the plan, and the commission may impose covenants to protect these areas. The commission\nmay require setbacks from documented areas of seasonal high groundwater less\nthan four feet from the surface, or further setbacks where the 100 foot non-\ndisturbance buffer area is insufficient to protect the wetlands. Tidal wetlands\nexisting within the marine environment bordering portions of the Pine Barrens\n\nZone are equally valuable natural resources. These wetlands support the\nreproduction of finfish and shellfish, provide habitat for waterfowl, and\ncontribute a scenic quality that supports recreational economies. Development\nproposals where tidal wetlands exist must be protected by a minimum 100 foot\nnon-disturbance area (measured horizontally from the identified wetland edge). The commission may require further setbacks where the 100 foot non-disturbance\narea is insufficient to protect the tidal wetlands. (c) Surface waters. Surface\nwaters, which include freshwater ponds, lakes, streams, rivers, and creeks, occur throughout the Pine Barrens. These are considered to be resources of\nsignificant value in economic, aesthetic and ecological terms. Their protection\nis judged to be vital to the dynamics of the Pine Barrens. Development\nproposals where surface waters exist must be protected by a 100 foot\nnon-disturbance buffer (measured horizontally from the water or wetland edge, whichever is more protective). The commission may require setbacks from\ndocumented seasonal surface waters, or further setbacks where the 100 foot\nnon-disturbance buffer is insufficient to protect the integrity of a surface\nwaterbody in terms of its quality, quantity, or natural function. (d) Rare and endangered species and\nunique natural communities. The Pine Barrens ecosystem encompasses\nseveral species of rare, endangered, and threatened animals and plants, as well\nas species of special concern, including the buck moth, tiger salamander, and\nlady slipper. The State of New York has identified such species and has enacted\nlaws to protect their number and habitat. The NYS Natural Heritage Program has\nalso identified unique natural communities and habitats of special concern. Development shall not have a significant negative impact on a habitat essential\nto those species identified by New York State maintained lists as rare, endangered, or threatened, nor on natural communities classified by the NYS\nNatural Heritage Program as G1, G2, G3 or S1, S2 or S3. (e) Native vegetation\ndisturbance. The vegetation association that defines or characterizes\nthe Pine Barrens includes pitch pines and various species of oak trees, plus\nnumerous understory and ground cover plants such as blueberry and bearberry and\ngrasses such as prairie bluestem and indian grass. Excessive, and often\nunnecessary, clearing of this native vegetation can result in severe soil\nerosion, excessive stormwater runoff, and destroyed plant and wildlife habitat. Furthermore, the replacement of native vegetation by plants and lawns requiring\nartificial fertilization increases the risk of groundwater contamination. See\n\nTable 2 (subdivision [e] of this section) for suggested native species, as well\nas specific nonnative species which are not recommended. It is the policy of\nthe commission to encourage minimal clearing of native vegetation. Development\nproposals must not exceed the clearance standards in Table 1 (subdivision [e]\nof this section). These percentages shall be taken over the total site\ninclusive of roads, building sites and drainage structures. The clearance\nstandard that would be applied to project site if developed under the existing\nresidential zoning category, should be applied if the proposal involves\nmulti-family units, attached housing, clustering or modified lot designs. Submissions to the commission for subdivisions shall contain calculations for\nclearing limits. These limits shall become part of the filed map. Furthermore, subdivision and site design must support preservation of natural vegetation in\nlarge unbroken blocks that allow contiguous open spaces to be established when\nadjacent parcels are developed.

The 208 Wastewater Treatment Management Plan indicated that\nfertilizers are a significant source of nitrogen and phosphorous contamination\nto ground and surface waters. Because of low natural fertility, soils common to\nthe Pine Barrens (Carver, Haven, Plymouth, and Riverhead) require both\nirrigation and fertilizer application for establishment and maintenance of turf\nand non-native vegetation. As native Pine Barrens vegetation is replaced with\nturf through residential development, increased contamination may be expected\nalong with a general change in the ecosystem. The 205J Special Groundwater\n\nProtection Areas study discussed limiting the amount of land devoted to turf as\na way to limit the amount of nitrogen leached from low density residential\ndevelopment (greater than or equal to one acre/unit). It is the policy of the\ncommission to discourage extensive establishment of turf and fertilizer\ndependent non-native vegetation. Development plans may place no more than 15\npercent of each not in vegetation requiring fertilization or 15 percent of the\nentire site for attached residential, commercial or industrial development. Table 2 (subdivision [e] of this section) should be consulted for examples of\nvegetation species appropriate to the Central Pine Barrens Area. (g) Steep slopes. Disturbance of, and construction on, steep slopes within the\n\nPine Barrens can require considerable removal of native vegetation resulting in\nexcessive surface water runoff and severe soil erosion. Additionally, steep\nsloped areas are subject to more rapid spread of wildfire than flat ground. All\nland clearing and construction must be confined to sites where slopes are no\ngreater than 15 percent. The commission will require that clearing envelopes be\ndrawn for lots within a subdivision containing slopes greater than 10 percent. These envelopes should be located on the lots to minimize the disturbance of\nthose slopes to the greatest extent possible. Construction of homes, roadways\nand private driveways on slopes greater than 10 percent may be approved if\ntechnical review shows that sufficient care has been taken in the design of\nstabilization measures, erosion control practices and structures so as to\nmitigate any negative environmental impacts. The commission review would be\nfacilitated if submissions contain a slope analysis showing slopes 0-10\npercent, 11-15 percent and 15 percent and greater. In areas with steep slopes, slope analysis maps may be required. This can be done with cross hatching or\nshading on the site plan for the appropriate areas. In addition, erosion and\nsediment control plans will be required in steeply sloped areas. (h) Runoff water. Development of lands within the Pine Barrens inevitably\nresults in an increase of runoff water following precipitation. Runoff water\noriginating from the roofs of buildings and from driveways is usually discharge\ndirectly to subsurface dry wells situated on the building lot. However, the\ngreat volume of runoff water originating from paved streets and roads is\nusually discharged by pipes into large open recharge basins or sumps. These\nbasins may cover several acres and require the removal of much native\nvegetation to the detriment of the site's ecology and aesthetics. The\ncommission advocates the use of natural recharge areas and/or drainage system\ndesigns that will cause minimum disturbance of the site. The commission will\nonly approve large excavated recharge basins where the use of natural swales\nand depressions and/or the installation of perforated pipe, vertical drains or\ndry wells is not practicable. The development plans must provide that all\nstormwater runoff originating from development on the property will be\nrecharged on site. Ponds should only be created in place of recharge basins, not for aesthetic purposes. They should be constructed and planted to create a\nshallow marsh habitat to filter runoff to the maximum extent possible. A\nmanagement plan should be developed which requires minimal augmentation and\nattempts to balance evaporation with size limitation of the pond. Further, the\ncommission will approve construction within natural swales and depressions\nwhere runoff and recharge naturally occurs only if the construction enhances\nthe natural drainage and recharge functions. (i) Agriculture and\nhorticulture. Scattered throughout the Pine Barrens are parcels devoted to\nagriculture and horticulture uses. Some of the parcels may be entirely devoted\nto these uses, whereas others may not. A certification of non-development will\nbe required by the applicant where it is proposed to commence or expand\nagricultural or horticultural uses. Since there may be some adverse impacts\nassociated with these uses, the commission will use the following standards to\nguide its recommendations pursuant to SEQR. For parcels that are entirely in\nactive agriculture or horticulture and within Hydrogeologic Zones III and V and\ncontain prime agricultural soils, the commission recommends the clustering of\nstructures on the poorest soils and retention of the remaining prime areas for\nagricultural or horticultural use of a nature that will cause minimal impact on\nthe groundwater quality. For those parcels which are not completely devoted to\nagricultural and horticultural uses, the commission, in its review of\ndevelopment proposals, will recommend balancing the continuation of the\nagricultural and horticultural uses with the protection of critical resource\nareas. Reclaiming of areas formerly used for agriculture and horticulture is\nacceptable, provided no local tree cutting or vegetation protection ordinances\nare violated, and that best management practices for the use of fertilizer or\npesticide, including integrated pest management, are employed. (j) Rezoning of land. While no amendments to local zoning laws and regulations\nshall take effect during the interim period, the commission may review some\nproposed actions and make comments pursuant to special environmental quality\nreview. Following are the guidelines the commission will use to further the\nplan goals for the compatible growth area until completion of the land use\nplan. The protection of groundwater quality and native vegetation/habitat are\ntwo paramount goals of the commission. Both of these goals may be threatened by\nrezonings that increase density or intensity of land use (such as rezoning from\nlarge-lot single-family residential to high-density multiple-family residential\nor rezoning from low-density residential to commercial or industrial use). Conversely, opportunities to transfer development rights or encourage\nappropriate development patterns may be lost with a premature rezoning. The\ncommission may recommend disapproval of any rezoning applications that increase\ndensity or intensity of use, unless applicants are able to demonstrate\nthat: (1)\nrezoning will not have a\ngreater threat to groundwater quality and/or native vegetation/habitat than\nexisting zoning; or\n(2)\nthat the\nrezoning will remove development from critical resource areas especially within\nthe core preservation area. (k) Commercial and industrial\ndevelopment. Throughout the compatible growth area are numerous parcels of\nland that are zoned for industrial use. Future development of these parcels by\nindustries that store and use toxic and hazardous chemicals could increase\ngroundwater contamination. The commission will encourage the development of\nvacant industrial sites within the compatible growth area to less\nintensive/less potentially hazardous uses and the relocation of industrial\ndevelopment outside the Central Pine Barrens in cases where appropriate\ninfrastructure does not exist. All industrial development must comply with the\nprovisions of articles 7 and 12 of the Suffolk County Sanitary Code, and the\nother interim standards contained herein. (l) Clustering. The use of the clustering technique within the Pine Barrens\nwill be encouraged in order to preserve open space, preserve habitats, protect\ncritical resource areas, attract non-contiguous development rights and values, improve infrastructure, and further the goals of the overall Central Pine\n\nBarrens area. The developer should contact the commission for assistance prior\nto designing the site plan. It is the recommendation of the commission that\nopen space resulting from clustering be protected through the use of covenants. Clustering can be used in site planning to minimize disturbance of sensitive\nportions of the site. The following should be used as guidelines in clustering\nresidential subdivisions: (1)\n\nWooded\n\nParcel - with slopes less than 10 percent on parcel. Recommendations - The development on a parcel, if adjacent to\nother parcels to be reviewed or adjacent to existing dedicated open space, should be clustered to take advantage of increasing natural open space. (2)\n\nWooded Parcel - more than 50\npercent of parcel has slopes less than 10 percent; remainder of parcel has\nslopes greater than 10 percent. Recommendations - Lots should be clustered on slopes less\nthan 10 percent. (3)\n\nWooded\nor Field - with slopes greater than 10 percent throughout site. Recommendations - Cluster lots to keep building envelopes\n(per town zoning) on slopes less than 10 percent. Roads and driveways should be designed to minimize the\ntraversing of slopes of greater than 10 percent and to minimize cuts and fills. Details of retaining walls and erosion control structures shall be provided for\nroads and driveways which transverse slopes greater than 10 percent. No\nretaining wall or erosion control structure shall be constructed beyond the\nright-of-way or eight feet beyond the edge of roadway whichever is less. For\nprivate driveways the limits of retaining walls and erosion control structures\nshall conform to the clearing limits set forth by the commission. Any\nsubdivision applications which contain building envelopes with slopes greater\nthan 10 percent or which, based on technical review, contain extensive use of\nretaining walls for the roadway system, may require a draft environmental\nimpact statement to analyze the impact of erosion and the changing of the\ncharacter of the land. The commission may disapprove an application where a\ntighter cluster than proposed is possible and preferable. (m) Coordinated\ndesign. Comprehensive, coordinated planning and design of development\nproposals, especially residential subdivisions, within the Pine Barrens is\nessential to ensure maximum preservation of open space and habitat linkages. Frequently, landowners design their subdivisions without adequate consideration\nof the existing development and/or of future plans for the adjacent parcels. This can result in inefficient road patterns that may require unnecessary\nclearing and lot layout which may prevent the preservation of large, unbroken\nblocks of open space. Also opportunities may be lost to coordinate the\ntransference of development rights and values between parcels. The developers\nshould contact the staff of the town for input on coordination of open spaces\nbetween adjacent parcels, and other pending development plans. It is the policy\nof the commission to review all development proposals for individual parcels in\nlight of the potential or existing layout of all adjacent parcels to ensure\nthat the designs are coordinated and that minimal clearing and maximum open\nspace preservation can be achieved. The owners of parcels are urged to consult\nwith the town planning personnel before designing their subdivisions. (n) Open space\nmanagement. The preservation of open spaces and the conservation of\nnative vegetation within the Pine Barrens is a central goal of the commission. Such open spaces may be configured as buffer areas, massing of large contiguous\nparcels, slope management areas, or wetland protection areas. However, proper\nmanagement of these areas is essential in order to protect open spaces from\nillegal dumping, clearing, motor vehicle trespass and other abuses of the\nenvironment. The commission may recommend that proposed open space be protected\nwith covenants that specify proper restrictions on its use and proper\ncontingencies for its future management. (o) Wellhead protection. For many years the New York State Department of Health has\nadvocated the exclusion of potentially contaminating activities from an area\nextending for 200 feet in all directions from the well site. Although this may\nhave been considered adequate to prevent the rapid drawdown of bacterial\ncontamination or its entry into ground water through poorly constructed wells, it seems unlikely to provide an appropriate level of protection against the\nsuite of organic and inorganic pollutants that threaten the community water\nsupplies. The commission will consider the location of nearby public supply\nwells and consult with the purveyor. Suffolk County Department of Health\n\nServices guidelines for private wells will be used for wellhead protection. When available, results of modelling for wellhead protection areas around\npublic supply wells will be considered by the commission. If it can be\ndemonstrated that a project will have a significant impact on water quality at\na public well site, the commission as part of its special environmental quality\nreview, may recommend against a project proceeding further. (p) Scenic, historic and cultural\nresources. The Long Island Pine Barrens Protection Act of 1993 specifies\nthat the plan shall identify and map critical resource areas including unique\nscenic or historic features. In the interim, development proposals will review\nand account for: (1)\n\nEstablished\ntrails, trail corridors, and compatible recreation areas. (2)\n\nScenic vistas, including high points\nwithin the Pine Barrens. (3)\n\nHistoric districts identified in local codes that are listed on the State or\n\nNational Register of Historic Places. (4)\n\nHistoric structures and landmarks\nidentified locally or listed on the State or National Register of Historic\n\nPlaces. (5)\n\nSensitive\narchaeological areas as identified by the New York State Office of Historic\n\nPreservation. Development proposals shall note any of the above within a\n500 foot radius. A development proposal may be disapproved if it may have a\nsignificant negative impact on a scenic or historic resource. (q) Hardship. If the application of these interim goals and standards cause\nunnecessary hardship, the commission may approve a development plan upon a\ndemonstration of hardship. Applicants will be required to meet the following\nfour tests, generally referred to in Town Law, section 267-b as \"use variance\ncriteria\": that for each and every permitted use under the zoning regulation\nfor the particular district where the property is located: (1)\n\nApplicant cannot realize a reasonable\nreturn, provided that lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by\ncompetent financial evidence. (2)\n\nThat the alleged hardship is unique and does not apply to a substantial portion\nof the district or neighborhood. (3)\n\nThat the requested hardship exemption, if\ngranted, will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood. (4)\n\nThat the alleged hardship has not been\nself-created. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
