  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-3.4 - Cash receipts register\n\nState Regulations\nA separate cash receipts register shall be maintained\nfor each general ledger. All funds received by the local agency, for which it\nis accountable with respect to a State-aided project, shall be recorded in the\ncash receipts register. All receipts, except receipts from tenants which may be\nrecorded in summary form from the underlying analysis, shall be entered\nindividually upon receipt, each cash transaction being entered on a separate\nline. The use of a journal voucher as a device making possible the fuller\nexplanation of a cash receipts transaction is recommended when such explanation\nis found necessary or advisable. Account 1129, Sundry Accounts Receivable, may\nbe used in this connection where applicable. Deposits of funds received shall\nbe made at least once daily. The date of receipt, however, shall control the\nentry to the cash receipts register, not the date of deposit. The cash receipts\nregister is ruled off at the end of each month. A specimen cash receipts\nregister for a single development project is shown as Exhibit 7 of Appendix\nS-8. A separate column shall be used for each bank account. Entries made in the\ngeneral ledger columns shall be posted to the general ledger individually and\ncurrently. Entries made in the other columns are posted, in total, at the end\nof each month to the respective accounts in the general ledger. Columns (16)\nand (17), other credits, are provided in the event that cash credits to a\nparticular general ledger account are sufficiently numerous to justify a\nseparate column for the accumulation of such credits. If used, the column shall\nbe headed by the appropriate account title dispensing with the designation\n\"other credits\" and the total of the column shall be posted at the end of the\nmonth as a credit to the appropriate general ledger account. Bank debits such\nas for bad checks shall not be entered in the cash receipts register as a\nreduction of the amount received but shall be entered in the cash\ndisbursements-voucher register. The instructions herein with respect to the\nspecimen form of cash receipts register for a single development project also\napply, in principle, to Exhibit 8 of Appendix S-8, the specimen form for a\nmultiple development project. The specimen form of cash receipts register for a\nmultiple development project reflects the segregation in separate bank accounts\nof the development and administration funds for the various sites included in\nthe project and separate accountability for each site. Such segregation and\nseparate accountability are not, however, mandatory, unless the division so\ndirects the local agency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-3.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
