  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 861.8 - Oxygen demand\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Biochemical\noxygen demand. The biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) shall mean the oxygen\nutilized during the first five days of aerobic decomposition at 20° C\nconsistent with the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of\n\nWater and Wastewater, published jointly by the American Public Health\n\nAssociation, the American Water Works Association, and the Water Pollution\n\nControl Federation. (b) Carbonaceous\noxygen demand. The carbonaceous oxygen demand of wastes forms the basis of\nallocating the capacity of the receiving waters to assimilate the oxygen demand\ngenerated by the waste discharges. The carbonaceous, or first stage, oxygen\ndemand is defined as the oxygen utilized in the carbonaceous reaction, as\ndistinguished from that utilized in the nitrogenous or second stage reaction. The carbonaceous oxygen demand is calculated by projecting the logarithmic rate\nof carbonaceous oxidation to completion. (c) Nitrogenous oxygen demand. The commission\nwill consider the nitrogenous demand of wastes, which generates a further gross\noxygen demand upon the receiving waters, in establishing treatment requirements\nwhere appropriate. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n861.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
