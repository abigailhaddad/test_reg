  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.555 - Upgrading to a pressure of 125 psig (862 kpa) or more in steel pipelines\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Unless the\nrequirements of this section have been met, no person may subject any segment\nof a steel pipeline to a pressure that is 125 psig (862 kPa) or more and that\nis above the established maximum allowable operating pressure. (b) Before increasing the operating pressure\nabove the previously established maximum allowable operating pressure, the\noperator shall comply with the following requirements: (1)\n\nReview the design, operating, and\nmaintenance history, and previous testing of the segment of pipeline and\ndetermine whether the proposed increase is safe and consistent with the\nrequirements of this Part. (2)\n\nMake\nany repairs, replacements, or alterations in the segment of pipeline that are\nnecessary for safe operation at the increased pressure. (3)\n\nVerify the condition of the pipe through\nthe use of test excavations. (4)\n\nEither prove compliance with the nondestructive testing requirements of\nsections\n255.241\n(b) and\n255.243\n(d) of\nthis Part for the current class location or nondestructively test a sufficient\nnumber of welds to achieve compliance with the minimum percentages listed in\nsection\n255.243\n(d) of\nthis Part for the current class location. (5)\n\nWhere nondestructive testing is required, the operator shall select welds within 150 feet (45.72 meters) of habitable\nstructures until the minimum percentage is achieved. (6)\n\nEstablish adequate cathodic protection in\ncompliance with section\n255.463\nof this Part. (c) After complying with\nsubdivision (b) of this section, an operator may increase the maximum allowable\noperating pressure of a segment of pipeline constructed before September 12, 1970 to the highest pressure that is permitted under section\n255.619\nof this Part, using as a\ntest pressure the highest pressure to which the segment of pipeline was\npreviously subjected (either in a strength test or in actual\noperation). (d) After complying\nwith subdivision (b) of this section, an operator that does not qualify under\nsubdivision (c) of this section may increase the previously established maximum\nallowable operating pressure if at least one of the following requirements are\nmet: (1)\n\nThe segment of pipeline is\nsuccessfully tested in accordance with the requirements of this Part for a new\nline of the same material in the same location. (2)\n\nAn increased maximum allowable operating\npressure may be established for a segment of pipeline in a Class 1 location if\nthe line has not previously been tested, and if: (i) it is impractical to test it in\naccordance with the requirements of this Part; (ii)\nthe new maximum operating pressure does\nnot exceed 80 percent of that allowed for a new line of the same design in the\nsame location; and\n(iii)\nthe\noperator determines that the new maximum allowable operating pressure is\nconsistent with the condition of the segment of pipeline and the design\nrequirements of this Part. (e) Where a segment of pipeline is upgraded\nin accordance with subdivision (c) or paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the\nincrease in pressure must be made in increments that are equal to: (1)\n10 percent of the pressure before the\nupgrading; or\n(2)\n25 percent of the\ntotal pressure increase, whichever produces the fewer number of\nincrements. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.555\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
