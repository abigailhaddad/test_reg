(2)\n\nHome health services\nmean the following services when prescribed by a physician and provided to an\nMA recipient in his or her home other than a general hospital or an RHCF: (i) nursing services provided on a part-time\nor intermittent basis by a certified home health agency or, if no certified\nhome health agency is available, by a registered professional nurse or a\nlicensed practical nurse acting under the direction of a recipient's\nphysician; (ii)\nphysical therapy, occupational therapy, or speech pathology and audiology services; and\n(iii)\nhome health aide services, as defined\nin the regulations of the Department of Health, provided by a person who meets\nthe training requirements of the Department of Health, whose information as\nrequired by Part 403 of Title 10 NYCRR has been entered into the home care\nservices worker registry, is assigned by a registered professional nurse to\nprovide home health aide services in accordance with a recipient's plan of\ncare, and is supervised by a registered professional nurse from a certified\nhome health agency or a therapist, in accordance with the regulations of the\n\nDepartment of Health. (b) Provision of home health\nservices. (1)\nA certified home health\nagency must provide home health services in accordance with applicable\nprovisions of the regulations of the Department of Health (article 7 of\n\nSubchapter C of Chapter V of Title 10 NYCRR) and with federal regulations\ngoverning home health services (42 CFR\n440.70\nand Part\n484). (2)\n\nAs part of the\ncomprehensive assessment or reassessment which a certified home health agency\nmust conduct for each recipient in accordance with the regulations of the\n\nDepartment of Health, a certified home health agency must consider the\nfollowing factors: (i) whether home health\nservices can be provided according to the recipient's plan of care, are\nmedically necessary and can maintain the recipient's health and safety in his\nor her own home, as determined in accordance with the regulations of the\n\nDepartment of Health; (ii)\nwhether\nthe recipient can be served appropriately and more cost-effectively by home\nhealth services provided under a consumer directed personal assistance program\nauthorized in accordance with section\n365-f\nof\nthe Social Services Law; (iii)\nwhether the functional needs, living arrangements and working arrangements of a\nrecipient who receives home health services solely for monitoring the\nrecipient's medical condition and well-being can be monitored appropriately and\nmore cost-effectively by personal emergency response services provided in\naccordance with section\n505.33\nof this Part; (iv)\nwhether the functional needs, living\narrangements and working arrangements of the recipient can be maintained\nappropriately and more cost-effectively by home health services provided by\nshared aides; (v) whether a\nrecipient who requires only personal care services or an appropriate substitute\nand who does not, as a part of a routine plan of care, require part-time or\nintermittent nursing or other therapeutic services, except for nursing services\nprovided to a medically stable recipient, can be served appropriately and more\ncost-effectively through the provision of personal care services available in\nthe district in accordance with section\n505.14\nof this Part; (vi)\nwhether home health services can be\nprovided appropriately and more cost-effectively by the certified home health\nagency in cooperation with an adult day health program or a clinic, rather than\non a fee-for-service basis; (vii)\nwhether the recipient can be served appropriately and more cost-effectively by\nother long-term care services including, but not limited to, services provided\nunder the long-term home health care program (LTHHCP), the assisted living\nprogram or the enriched housing program; and\n(viii)\nwhether the recipient can be served\nappropriately and more cost-effectively by using specialized medical equipment\ncovered by the MA program including, but not limited to, insulin\npens. (3)\n\nIf a certified\nhome health agency determines that a recipient can be served appropriately and\nmore cost-effectively through the provision of services which are described in\nsubparagraphs (2)(ii) through (viii) of this subdivision and the certified home\nhealth agency determines that such services are available in the social\nservices district, the certified home health agency must first consider the use\nof such services in developing the recipient's plan of care. The recipient must\nuse such services rather than home health services to achieve the maximum\nreduction in his or her need for home health services or other long-term care\nservices. (4)\nA certified home\nhealth agency must have a written agreement with each hospice that is available\nin the certified home health agency's service area. The agreement must specify\nthe procedures for notifying recipients who the certified home health agency\nreasonably expects would be appropriate for hospice services of the\navailability of hospice services and for referring such recipients to hospice\nservices. A certified home health agency must not refer a recipient to hospice\nservices if the recipient's physician determines that hospice services are\nmedically contra-indicated or the recipient does not choose to receive hospice\nservices. (c) Payment and reimbursement. (1)\n\nThe department will pay providers of home health services for home health\nservices provided under this section at rates established by the Commissioner\nof Health and approved by the Director of the Budget; however, no payment will\nbe made unless the claim for payment is supported by documentation of the time\nspent providing services to each recipient. (2)\n\nCertified home health agencies must\nmaximize Medicare and third-party revenues, in accordance with the requirements\nof this Title, and report to the department annually on such efforts. (i) A certified home health agency with a\nproportion of Medicare or third-party revenue which is less than 20 percent of\nthe Statewide or regional average for its peer group, whichever the\ncommissioner determines more appropriate, must submit a statement to the\ndepartment explaining the difference. (ii)\n\nIf an audit demonstrates that a\ncertified home health agency has not implemented good faith efforts to collect\n\nMedicare and third-party revenues, the agency may be subject to the recoupment\nof MA payments for claims which are otherwise payable. (3)\n\nReimbursement. State reimbursement to\nsocial services districts for the costs of home health services provided under\nthis section is available in accordance with Social Services Law, section\n368-a(1)(g).

Berberich\nSUBJECT: Further Catanzano\n\nAssistant Commissioner\ninstructions: retroactive\nrelief\n\nThis memorandum contains further instructions regarding\nthe preliminary injunction issued on February 16, 1994, in\n\nCatanzano et\nal. v. Dowling et al. (USDC, WDNY). In Section IV of\nthe Department's February 18th letter to social services districts and CHHAs\nregarding the\n\nCatanzano\npreliminary injunction, the department\ninformed them that it would be providing such instructions regarding\nretroactive relief as soon as possible. The specific section of the court's order directing\nretroactive relief requires the State and County defendants to: \"take immediate steps to provide notice and hearing\nrights to members of plaintiffs' class who have had their home health care\nservices suspended, terminated or reduced without the benefit of notice, the\nright to a hearing or aid-continuing since November 15, 1993.\"\nTo comply with this order, each social services district\nmust review its case records on each home health services recipient for whom a\nCHHA conducted a fiscal assessment and, as a result of the fiscal assessment, reduced or discontinued (\ni.e. suspended or terminated) the\nrecipient's home health services on or after November 15, 1993. Please note that the order does not apply to Medical\n\nAssistance recipients who were hospitalized when the CHHA conducted the fiscal\nassessment. In addition, the order does not apply to CHHA determinations to\nreduce or discontinue a recipient's home health services for reasons that are\nunrelated to the costs of the recipient's care when compared to 90 percent of\nresidential health care facility costs and the recipient's failure to meet any\nexception criteria. Specifically, each district must identify each case that\nmeets the following requirements: a. The CHHA conducted a fiscal assessment on a Medical Assistance recipient who, at the time of the fiscal assessment, was receiving home health services from\nthe CHHA and was not hospitalized, and the CHHA reduced or discontinued the\nrecipient's home health services on or after November 15, 1993, as a result of\nthe fiscal assessment; b. The\nsocial services district agreed with the CHHA's determination that the\nrecipient's home health services should be reduced or discontinued on or after\n\nNovember 15, 1993; and\nc. The\nsocial services district did not provide the recipient with a timely notice and\nan opportunity for a fair hearing to review the determination that the\nrecipient's home health services should be reduced or discontinued. Social services districts and CHHAs have the following\nresponsibilities for each home health services recipient who meets the\nrequirements set forth in a - c, above: 1. The social services district must notify\nthe CHHA of each recipient whom the district has identified as meeting these\nrequirements. 2. For each recipient\nwho the district has determined meet these requirements, the CHHA must\nreinstate the home health services that the recipient received immediately\nprior to the CHHA's reduction or discontinuance made as a result of the fiscal\nassessment. The CHHA must notify the social services district when it has\nreinstated the recipient's home health services. 3. For each such recipient, the CHHA must\nthen complete a new fiscal assessment in accordance with the provisions of 92\nADM-50 and notify the social services district of the results of the new fiscal\nassessment in accordance with 18 NYCRR\n505.23\n(c) and 92 ADM-50. 4. The social services district must send the\nrecipient a timely notice and an opportunity to request a fair hearing to\nreview any proposed reduction or discontinuance that the CHHA proposes to take\nas a result of the new fiscal assessment that the CHHA has completed in\naccordance with Step 3, above. The district must use the appropriate fair\nhearing notice attached to 92 ADM-50, but must modify the notice as follows: Agreement on Reductions: When the social services district agrees with the CHHA\nthat the recipient's home health services must be reduced, the social services\ndistrict must send the recipient a timely \"Notice of Decision to Reduce (Fiscal\n\nAssessment) Home Health Services\" (Attachment 4 to 92 ADM-50). Please note that\nthe social services district does not refer these cases to the local\nprofessional director or designee. In the \"BECAUSE\" section of the notice, the\ndistrict must thus cross out the words, \"Local Professional Director or\ndesignee,\" and insert the words, \"social services official,\" so that the\nsentence reads as follows: \"Your case has been reviewed by the social services\nofficial and it is his/her determination, based on your current medical\ncondition, that your home health care services must be reduced.\"\nAgreement on Discontinuances: When the social services district agrees with the CHHA\nthat the recipient's home health services must be discontinued, the social\nservices district must send the recipient a timely \"Notice of Decision to\n\nDiscontinue (Fiscal Assessment) Home Health Services\" (Attachment 5 to 92\nADM-50). Again, please note that the social services district does not refer\nthese cases to the local professional director or designee. Consequently, in\nthe first sentence of the second paragraph of the notice, the district must\ncross out the words, \"the Local Professional Director or designee has,\" and\ninsert the words, \"the social services official,\" so that the sentence reads as\nfollows: \"We are taking this action because the social services official has\ndecided that:\"\n5. The\nsocial services district must notify the CHHA of each recipient who timely\nrequests a fair hearing with aid-continuing. The Department's Office of\n\nAdministrative Hearings will notify the social services district of all such\nrecipients. 6. The CHHA must not\nreduce or discontinue the recipient's home health services until the effective\ndate of the notice and must continue to provide the recipient with\naid-continuing upon being notified by the district that the recipient has\ntimely requested a hearing with aid-continuing. Aid-continuing is defined as\nthe same type of home health services, at the same scope and frequency, as the\nrecipient received immediately prior to the reduction or discontinuance made as\na result of the fiscal assessment. The department will issue instructions as soon as\npossible regarding notice and fair hearing rights for home health services\napplicants. Pending such further instructions, no fiscal assessments are to be\nperformed on any MA recipient who first applies for home health services on or\nafter February 16, 1994.
