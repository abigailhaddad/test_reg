Tit. 6 §§ 380-5.2 - Compliance with dose limits for individual members of the public\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each person\nsubject to this Part must make or cause to be made, as appropriate, surveys of\nradiation levels in unrestricted areas in the environment and radioactive\nmaterials in effluents released to unrestricted areas in the environment to\ndemonstrate compliance with the dose limits for individual members of the\npublic established in section\n380-5.1\nof this Subpart. (b) Surveys must show compliance with the\nannual dose limit in section\n380-5.1\nof this Subpart by: (1)\ndemonstrating by measurement or\ncalculation that the total effective dose equivalent to the individual likely\nto receive the highest dose from the disposal or release does not exceed the\nannual dose limit; or\n(2)\ndemonstrating that: (i) the annual average\nconcentrations of radioactive material released in effluents to air or water at\nthe emission point or point of discharge do not exceed the values specified in\n\nTable II of section\n380-11.7\nof this Part; and\n(ii)\nif an individual were\ncontinually present in an unrestricted area, the dose from external sources\nwould not exceed 0.002 rem (0.02 mSv) in an hour and 0.05 rem (0.5 mSv) in a\nyear. (c) Upon approval from the Department, a permittee may adjust the effluent\nconcentration values in Table II of section\n380-11.7\nof this Part, for members\nof the public, to take into account the actual physical and chemical\ncharacteristics of the effluent (e.g., aerosol size distribution, solubility, density, radioactive decay equilibrium, chemical form). Nothing in this\nsubdivision alters the requirements of section\n380-5.1\nof this subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
