  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 270-6.1 - Fees, commercial structures\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe consideration to be charged for each grant of\neasement, lease, permit or lesser interest in lands underwater shall be fixed\nby the Commissioner of General Services in accordance with article 6 of the\n\nPublic Lands Law and the following guidelines. (a) Commercial structures (not in existence\non August 7, 1992) shall be charged the following: annual fee not to exceed two\npercent of net annual income. (b) Commercial structures (in existence and commercial use on or before August 7, 1992) shall be charged the following: annual fee not to exceed following\npercentage of net annual income: Year 1 -.2 (two tenths) of one percent\n\nYear 2 -.4 (four tenths) of one percent\n\nYear 3 -.6 (six tenths) of one percent\n\nYear 4 -.8 (eight tenths) of one percent\n\nYear 5 and thereafter, one percent. (c) The net annual income upon which the fee\nis based shall include income derived from the earnings or rental of structures\non State-owned lands underwater after deduction for associated operating and\nmaintenance expenses and shall exclude earnings derived from operation not\ndirectly associated with the rental of such structures, such as the sale and\nrepair of boats and the sale of gasoline. The commissioner may request the\napplicant to provide financial statements for the preceding two-year period in\norder to calculate the net annual income. (d) As an alternative to income based fees, the commissioner, in cooperation and consultation with the marine trades\nindustry, may develop a regional fee schedule based upon a market analysis of\nannual fees charged by marina facilities for slip rental and classified by\nfactors such as location, access and condition, with appropriate deduction for\nrelated operating expenses. The regional fee will be expressed in terms of\n\"dollars per foot of slip length\" and remain subject to the fee guidelines of\nthis section. In the event the regional fee schedule is developed, any marina\nowner disputing the regional fee shall have the opportunity to object to the\nimposition of the regional fee, pursuant to the terms of section\n270-6.6\nof this Subpart. (e) No increase in the value of the dollar\nshall be permitted during the initial five-year period. Adjustments after the\ninitial five-year period shall be based upon the Consumer Price Index (CPI-W)\nas provided by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. (f) In the event calculation of net annual\nincome from the nonexempt structure(s) is not possible based upon type of\nstructure involved or the financial information provided by the applicant, the\ncommissioner may appraise the structure using either the cost or market\napproach to value, as appropriate. (g) In the event an annual permit is issued\nfor the structure, the fee to be charged shall be discounted 10\npercent. (h) Payment of fees shall\nbe made annually on the anniversary date of the lease, easement, permit or\nlesser interest. The commissioner may, upon request of the owner or user of the\nadjacent upland, agree to provide for different periodic payments or a more\nflexible payment structure than the fee caps and fees set forth\nherein.
