  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.747 - Valve maintenance: distribution systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each valve, the use of which may be\nnecessary for the safe shutdown or sectionalization of a distribution system, must be inspected and partially operated at intervals not exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year. Included are the principal shut-off\nvalves at district regulator stations and pressure-limiting devices. (b) Each operator must take prompt remedial\naction to correct any valve found inoperable, unless the operator designates an\nalternative valve. (c) The location\nof all valves in distribution systems that may be required during an emergency\nshall be designated on appropriate records, drawings or maps, in relation to\naboveground structures, so that the valves and associated access covers can be\nreadily located when the ground is covered with snow and ice. Since there may\nbe changes or alterations in aboveground structures over a period of time, the\naccuracy of the reference points established shall be verified at the time of\nthe periodic inspection. (d) At the\ntime of the periodic inspection, valves will be checked for external\nleakage. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.747\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
