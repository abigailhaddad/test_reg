The two methods are as follows: (1)\nreimbursement may be made periodically, during the progress of project development, for those portions of the project\nwhich have been completed; or\n(2)\nreimbursement will be made at the time of completion of the full\nproject. (b) Final\npayments for all projects will require substantiation that project goals have\nbeen fulfilled. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
