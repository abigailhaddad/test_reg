Tit. 6 § 481.4 - How much must be paid\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The amount of\nannual program fees each regulated person must pay is computed under Parts 482\nthrough 486 of this Title, as applicable. (b) The fee for a new or modified permit, certificate or approval for a prospective activity governed by a State\nenvironmental regulatory program is computed under Parts 482 through 486 of\nthis Title, as applicable, but prorated from the date of issuance. (c) For waste transporters only, fees are\nprorated based on the date that the permit becomes effective. All other program\nfees are prorated only from the date of issuance. Prorated fees are calculated\nby multiplying the annual fee by the number of days remaining in the calendar\nor permit year (number of days in permit year for waste transporter program\nfees) from the date of issuance, divided by 365. (d) The department may change any program fee\nfor a calendar or permit year at any time during the calendar or permit year or\nwithin the three calendar or permit years next following the close of the\ncalendar or permit year for which the fee is being changed.
