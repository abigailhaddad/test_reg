(2)\nA person shall be considered disabled if\nthe person has a disability as that term is defined in the Human Rights Act\n(Executive Law, § 292[21]). The definition is as follows: The term disability\nmeans a physical, mental or medical impairment resulting from anatomical, physiological or neurological conditions which prevents the exercise of a\nnormal bodily function or is demonstrable by medically accepted clinical or\nlaboratory diagnostic techniques; provided, however, that in all provisions of\nthis Article dealing with employment, the term shall be limited to physical, mental or medical conditions which do not prevent the complainant from\nperforming in a reasonable manner the activities involved in the job or\noccupation sought. (3)\nA person\nshall be considered blind if the person has central visual acuity of 20/200 or\nless in the better eye with the use of a correcting lens.

The letter must identify\na telephone number which may be called to request emergency assistance and must\nindicate the date by which utility service will be terminated unless an\napplication for assistance has been completed by the household and reviewed and\napproved by the district, or the situation which will result in the\ndisconnection of utility service will be resolved in a timely manner. (ii)\n\nTake appropriate steps to ensure that\nsupport services are involved to coordinate applications for emergency\nassistance to continue or to restore service. (f) Training. The local social services\ndistrict shall participate with the utility corporation, as necessary, in joint\ntraining/orientation programs to insure the effective implementation of these\nprocedures.
