  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 419.3 - Crediting of payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In general. All mortgage loan payments received by a servicer at the\naddress where the borrower has been instructed in writing to make payments\nshall be credited, or treated as credited, on the business day received, to the\nextent that the borrower has provided sufficient information to credit the\naccount. For all mortgage loans originated after January 1, 2011, except when\ninconsistent with Federal law or regulation or as provided in subdivision (d)\nof this section, such payments shall be credited by the servicer to the\ninterest and principal due on the home loan before crediting the payments to\ntaxes, insurance, or fees. (b) Reasonable payment\nrequirements. Requirements imposed by a servicer for making payments must\nbe reasonable. A cut-off time at the end of the business day for receipt of a\nmailed check at the location specified by the servicer for receipt of such\ncheck is deemed to be reasonable. (c) Non-conforming payments. If a borrower fails to comply with a servicer's reasonable\npayments requirements that have been provided to the borrower in writing, the\nservicer shall credit any payment accepted by the servicer as soon as\ncommercially practicable, but in no event later than 5 days after\nreceipt. (d) Late\npayments. Late payments must be credited to interest, principal, taxes, insurance and other fees before any late fee is collected. (e) Scheduled method of\naccounting. If a servicer uses the scheduled method of accounting, any\nregularly scheduled payment made prior to the scheduled due date shall be\ncredited no later than the due date or 30 days from the date of receipt, whichever is earlier. (f) Notice of noncredit. If a servicer receives any payment on a mortgage loan and\ndoes not credit it or treat it as credited by the due date or within 30 days\nfrom the date of receipt, whichever is earlier, the servicer shall, within 10\nbusiness days of receipt, send the borrower notice by mail to the borrower's\nlast known address indicating the reason the payment was not credited or\ntreated as credited to the account, and any actions the borrower needs to take\nto make the loan current. Such notice may instead be sent electronically in\naccordance with the requirements of article III of the Technology Law, if the\nborrower has previously opted for paperless billing. (g) Payment overages and\nshortages. A servicer shall establish written policies and procedures\nfor payment overages and shortages, including unapplied funds and payments held\nin suspense accounts. If a servicer retains a partial payment in a suspense or\nunapplied funds account, the servicer shall, on accumulation of sufficient\nfunds in any suspense or unapplied funds account to cover a periodic payment, treat such funds as a periodic payment and credit the periodic payment to the\nborrower's loan. (h) A\nservicer shall not apply funds from a suspense or unapplied funds account to\npay fees until all unpaid principal, interest, and escrow amounts (if\navailable) are paid and brought current or the loan is discharged or\nforeclosed.
