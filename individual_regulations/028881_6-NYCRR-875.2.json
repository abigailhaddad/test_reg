  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 875.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item number. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portion thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adapted\nfrom that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological\nsurvey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a\ndrainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name\nor an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Mohawk-Hudson watershed in 1934 and has been closely followed in connection\nwith the identification of the waters with the following exceptions: some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the\ntime of its 1934 survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the\nnewer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib. and\ntribs. indicating\ntributary\nand\ntributaries\nrespectively, shall mean any stream, lake, pond or\nother body of surface water which flows into any other stream, lake, pond, or\nother body of surface water. Where no tributaries are mentioned, the\nspecifically designated waters shall include only the stream, pond or other\nbody of surface water designated by such waters index number; where tributaries\nare mentioned after the waters index number the specifically designated waters\nshall include the stream, pond, or other body or surface water designated by\nsuch waters index number and all tributaries and subtributaries thereof which\nare shown on the reference maps, unless exceptions are expressly\nstated. (d) Name\nas appearing in table I shall mean the name by which the specifically\ndesignated waters are generally known and which name may appear on the\nreference maps. In cases of specifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to which the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as\nfar as possible. (e) Description. The column headed \"Description\" contains designation or\nsections of waters under consideration to which a particular assignment of a\nclass and standards shall apply. Also included in this column is any useful\ninformation pertinent to the classification and standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as\nappearing in table I means map reference number and indicates one or more of\nthe following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on which\nthe specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown. The\nfollowing maps were produced from original maps which may be procured through\nthe Washington Distribution Section, Geological Survey. Map Ref. No. Name of\nquadrangle\n\nPublished by\n\nEdition\n2A\nUtica West\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1949\n2B\nUtica East\n\nCorps of Engineers, U.S. Army\n1945\n2C\nCassville\n\nCorps of Engineers, U.S. Army\n1945\n2D\nWest Winfield\n\nCorps of Engineers, U.S. Army\n1945\n(g) Class\nas appearing in\ntable I and denoted by the letters A, B or C opposite each specifically\ndesignated waters means class A, B or C as the case may be, as set forth in\n\nPart 701, supra. (h) Standards\nas appearing\nin table I, as the letters A, B or C opposite each specifically designated\nwaters shall mean the standards of quality and purity established for class A, B or C as the case may be, as set forth in Part 701, supra. The symbol (T) after any class designation shall mean that the designated\nwaters are trout waters and that the dissolved oxygen specification for trout\nwaters shall apply thereto. The symbol (TS) after any standard designation\nshall mean that the designated waters are suitable for trout spawning and that\nthe dissolved oxygen specification for trout spawning waters shall apply\nhereto. (i) The term\ntrout\nas used in this Part means any fish in the following\ngenera: \"Coregonus\", \"Oncorhynchus\", \"Prosopium\", \"Salmo\", \"Salvelinus\" and\n\"Thymallus\". (j) All streams or\nother bodies of water which appear as lines to indicate natural waters on the\nreference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated in table I, shall be assigned the same classes and standards of quality and purity as the\nspecifically designated waters to which they are directly tributary. (k) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standards as the waters to which it is\ndirectly tributary. (l) The\n\nSauquoit Creek drainage basin shall be deemed to include the following areas: all land and water areas the natural surface water drainage from which is\ndirectly or indirectly tributary to the mouth of Sauquoit Creek at its junction\nwith the Mohawk River.
