(4) Solution temperature shall be automatically controlled by the use of a temperature regulator with a response range of ± 5°F. (5) The system shall be provided with a recording thermometer having a scale range of 60° to 180°F. with extension of scale on either side permitted: graduated in time scale divisions of not more than 15 minutes. Between 110° and 180°F., the chart shall be graduated in temperature divisions of not more than 2°F., spaced not less than 1/16 inch apart, and be accurate within 2°F. ±. The sensor shall be protected against damage at 212°F. The sensing element of the recording thermometer shall be located in the return solution line. (6) All connections between the solution circuit and the product circuit shall be so constructed as to positively prevent the comingling of the product and solution during processing. G. INSTALLATION WELDING REQUIREMENTS\n(1) All welding of sanitary product pipelines and solution lines shall be made by the Tungsten Shielded Arc Method or another equally satisfactory method may be used. The following precautions shall be taken. (a) Inert back-up gas shall be used to protect and control the interior of the weld. (b) The weld surface (interior, face and exterior) shall be cleaned and freed of all foreign matter and surface oxide before welding. Iron free abrasive shall be used when cleaning surfaces. (c) All tube and fittings ends shall be square cut and deburred. (d) Welding procedures shall assure uniform and complete penetration of weld at all times. (e) All welds having pits, craters, ridges, or imbedded foreign materials shall be removed and the joints shall be properly re-welded. (f) Internal and external grinding and/or polishing of welds is not required. (g) An acceptable sample weld piece shall be provided at the beginning of each day and/or section welding operation or when required. (h) A boroscope or other acceptable inspection device, to inspect representative welds, shall be made available by the processor. H. CLEANING AND SANITIZING PROCEDURES\n(1) A rinsing, cleaning and santitizing regimen which has been demonstrated to be effective shall be employed. Because of the possibilities of corrosion, the recommendations of the cleaning compound manufacturer shall be followed with respect to the time, temperature, and the concentration of specific acid or alkaline solutions and bactericides. To insure proper strength of solution and to avoid corrosion, the cleaning compound shall be completely dissolved or dispersed prior to circulation. One regimen found to be satisfactory is as follows: (a) Immediately after concluding the day's operations, all connections between cleaned-in-place lines and processing equipment which are not included in the cleaning circuit shall be removed, the openings capped, by-pass connections made, and the lines rinsed thoroughly with tempered water (not to exceed 120°F., entering circuit) continuously discarding the rinse water near the downstream end of the solution return line until the discarded effluent is clear. (b) All solution and product contact surfaces not cleanable by mechanical cleaning procedures shall be cleaned manually. (c) Circulate an effective detergent solution for a period of time at a concentration and temperature capable of effectively removing the soil residue in the circuit. (d) Thoroughly rinse the detergent solution from the circuit. (e) Circulate an acid detergent, when needed, as a supplement to the routine circulation. Follow this acid detergent treatment with a thorough rinse. (f) Sanitize all product surfaces with one or a combination of the following commonly used methods: (1) Circulation of water at a minimum temperature of 170°F. (at the discharge end) through the circuit for five minutes and drained. (2) Pumping of an approved chemical sanitizer solution of acceptable strength and recommeded temperature through product lines and equipment for at least one minute and drained. (3) Exposure to steam at a temperature of 170°F. (at the drainage outlet), for 15 minutes or at a temperature of 200°F. for five minutes. (Approved sanitation procedures and related recommendations are provided in detail in the Grade \"A\" Pasteurized Milk Ordinance-1965 Recommendations of the U.S. Public Health Service.)\n(2) Prior to installation, a description of the cleaning regimen which has been demonstrated to be effective for each circuit shall be made available by the processor. APPENDIX.......................................................................................... A. STAINLESS STEEL MATERIALS\nStainless steel conforming to the applicable composition ranges established by AISI for wrought products, or by ACI for cast products, should be considered in compliance with the requirements of section C. (1) herein. Where welding is involved the carbon content of the stainless steel should not exceed 0.08%. The reference cited in C. (1) sets forth the chemical ranges and limits of accpetable stainless steels of the 300 series. Cast grades of stainless steel equivalent to types 303, 304, and 316 are designated CF-16F, CF-8, and CF-8M, respectively. These cast grades are covered by ASTM\n4\nspecifications A296 and A351. B. PRODUCT CONTACT SURFACE FINISH\nSurface finish equivalent to 150 grit or better as obtained with silicon carbide, is considered in compliance with the requirements of section D. (1) herein. C. TYPES OF WELDS\n(1)\n\nAutomatic Welds\n-A fully automatic weld is described as that made by equipment which starts and completes the weld, strikes, and controls the arc with no manual adjustment of control during the welding cycle and will consistantly make repetitive welds. (2)\n\nSemi-automatic Weld\n-A semi-automatic weld is described as that made by equipment which requires manual strike and/or control and will consistently make repetitive welds. (3)\n\nHand Weld\n-A weld in which the positioning of the arc is manually controlled. D. CAST SURFACES COMPARISON STANDARD\nA copy of National Aircraft Standard 823 (NAS823) is appended to these practices. Because the intent of the standard is that it be a visual guide, Approximate RMS finishes are shown as references only. The reason for establishing a visual standard is to overcome the obvious inadequacy of any arithmetical or geometrical measuring system when applied to a surface as variable as that found on a casting. This standard is available from: Aluminum Co. of America, 1145 Wilshire Boulevard, Los Angeles 17, California... _______..................................................................................... These practices become effective on June 9, 1966 at which time the 3-A Suggested Method For The Installation And Cleaning Of Cleaned-In-Place Sanitary Milk Pipe Lines For Use In Milk And Milk Products Plants, dated March-April, 1953, is rescinded.
