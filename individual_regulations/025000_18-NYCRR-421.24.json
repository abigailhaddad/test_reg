(iii)\n\nWhen a person adopting is 62 years old\nor older, or will be subject to mandatory retirement from present employment\nwithin five years of the date of adoptive placement, such person's income shall\nbe disregarded in computing annual income. (11)\n\nFor adoptions where the initial approval\nof the adoption subsidy agreement was made prior to September 1, 2023, if the\nannual income of the person(s) adopting a handicapped or hard-to-place child\npursuant to the provisions of this section, as determined by the applicable\nprovisions of paragraph (10) of this subdivision, is equal to or less than the\napplicable State income standard, the monthly payment for care and maintenance\nof the adopted child must be 100 percent of the applicable board rate, unless\nthe person(s) adopting voluntarily and, in writing, request and agree to a\nlower rate. (12)\n(i) For adoptions where the initial approval\nof the adoption subsidy agreement was made prior to September 1, 2023, if the\nannual income of the person(s) adopting a handicapped or hard-to-place child\npursuant to the provisions of this section, as determined by the applicable\nprovisions of paragraph (10) of this subdivision, is greater than the\napplicable State income standard, a social services district has two options in\ndetermining the amount to be paid for care and maintenance of the child.

The social\nservices district must: (1)\ncalculate the\nannual income of the person(s) adopting pursuant to the applicable provisions\nof paragraph (10) of this subdivision; (2)\ndetermine what percentage such annual\nincome is of the applicable State income standard; and\n(3)\nuse the following schedule to determine\nthe amount to be paid based on the percentage calculated in subclause\n(\n2\n) of this clause: ADOPTION SUBSIDY PAYMENTS SCHEDULE\nAnnual income of person(s) adopting; percentage of applicable State income standard\n\nAmount of\nadoption subsidy payment\n\nOver 100% but not more than 110%\n95% of\n\nApplicable Board Rate\n\nOver 110% but not more than 120%\n90% of\n\nApplicable Board Rate\n\nOver 120% but not more than 130%\n85% of\n\nApplicable Board Rate\n\nOver 130% but not more than 140%\n80% of\n\nApplicable Board Rate\n\nOver 140%\n75% of Applicable Board Rate\n(ii)\n\nThe social services district must use\nthe same option for all subsidized adoptions. If a social services district\nwishes to change from one option to the other option, the district must inform\nthe department in writing of the intended change at least 30 days prior to the\neffective date of the change. The district must use the newly selected option\nin all new subsidy agreements entered into on or after the effective date of\nthe change. Subsidy agreements finalized before the effective date of the\nchange will not be affected by the change. (13)\n\nThe department may authorize the social\nservices official to approve or disapprove the written agreement on behalf of\nthe department pursuant to section\n453\n(2)\nof the Social Services Law. (i) The standards for authorization include, but are not limited to, the following: (a) the social services district must submit a written request to the department\nrequesting authorization to approve adoption subsidy agreements concerning\nhard-to-place and/or handicapped children; (b) the social services district must have an\nadequate number of staff who have been properly trained in the requirements of\nthe Federal and State adoption assistance program and the agreement approval\nprocess; (c) the social services\ndistrict must have a satisfactory and effective system in place to complete the\nreview and approval of written adoption subsidy agreements; (d) the social services district must assume\nresponsibility for maintaining the necessary files and documentation for\n\nFederal and State audits and fair hearings, and for providing information to\nthe department related to such audits and hearings; and\n(e) the social services district must be\nwilling to assume fiscal responsibility for those cases which the district has\nbeen authorized by the department to approve. (ii)\n\nThe department may require social\nservices districts to comply with additional standards to ensure that a social\nservices district complies with State and Federal adoption assistance\nrequirements, and may revoke the authority of a social service official to\napprove written adoption subsidy agreements when the social services district\nfails to comply with the Federal or State statutory and regulatory standards\nrelating to the administration of the adoption assistance\nprogram. (14)\n\nExcept\nwhere the social services district has been authorized by the department to\napprove or disapprove written adoption subsidy agreements, all written\nagreements for payments for the care and maintenance of handicapped or\nhard-to-place children must be submitted to the department for approval or\ndisapproval, in accordance with the provisions of title 9 of article 6 of the\n\nSocial Services Law and this section. A disapproval must be in writing and must\nstate the reasons therefor. If an agreement is not disapproved in writing by\nthe department or the social services district, where the social services\ndistrict has been authorized by the department to approve or disapprove the\nwritten agreement within 30 days after its receipt, it will be deemed approved\nexcept that: (i) in the case of an agreement\nsubmitted pursuant to section\n453\n(d) of the Social Services Law, approval will\nbe granted contingent upon commitment of the guardianship and custody of the\nchild to an authorized agency; and\n(ii)\nin the case of an agreement submitted by\na voluntary authorized agency to a social services official, the voluntary\nagency may submit the agreement directly to the department for approval or\ndisapproval if the agreement is not approved or disapproved by the social\nservices official within 30 days of submission. (15)\n\nNeither the written agreement nor the\namount of the payment is subject to an annual review, except as provided for by\nparagraph (17) of this subdivision. However, the adopting person(s) may request\na review of the agreement and/or a change in the amount paid under the\nagreement. Such review or change may be granted at the discretion of the social\nservices official in accordance with the regulations, and subject to the\napproval of the department if the agreement was approved by the department, as\nset forth in paragraph (14) of this subdivision. (16)\n\nThe social services official may adjust\nthe monthly payment in accord with the provisions of the schedules in\nparagraphs (9) and (12) of this subdivision and changes made thereto by the\ndepartment pursuant to the provisions of section\n453\n(3)\nof the Social Services Law. Except as\nprovided for by paragraph (17) of this subdivision, any change in the amount of\nthe monthly payment must be made by amendment to the written agreement and must\nrequire the consent of the adoptive parent(s) and the approval of the\ndepartment if the agreement was approved by the department, as set forth in\nparagraph (14) of this subdivision. (17)\n\nWhenever the applicable board rate\nincreases due to an increase in the board rate, and/or the clothing replacement\nallowance or whenever a change in the age of an adopted child qualifies such\nchild to receive adoption subsidy payments at an increased rate, the social\nservices official responsible for making adoption subsidy payments must adjust\nthe adoption subsidy payments to reflect such increases. A review must be\nconducted by such official to ensure that such adjustments are included in the\nadoption subsidy payments made to the persons who have entered into adoption\nsubsidy agreements. The official must provide such person(s) with appropriate\nnotice of such adjustments. Such notice will constitute an amendment to the\nadoption subsidy agreement and must be attached to such agreement. Such\nadjustments in payments are neither subject to the approval of the department\nnor subject to the consent of the adoptive parent(s). (18)\n(i) Upon the death of the person(s) who adopted the child prior to the 21st\nbirthday of the child, payments made pursuant to this subdivision must continue\nand must be made to the legal guardian or custodian of the child under the age\nof 18 upon the issuance of letters of guardianship or order of custody until\nthe child has attained the age of 21. If the guardian or custodian was the\ncaretaker of the child under the age of 18 prior to the issuance of letters of\nguardianship or order of custody, such payments must be made retroactively from\nthe death of the adoptive parent or parents. All provisions of this section\napplicable to maintenance payments made to the person(s) who adopted the child\nwill be applicable to maintenance payments made to the legal guardian or\ncustodian of the child. (ii)\n(a) Upon the death of the sole or surviving\nadoptive parent or both adoptive parents after the 18th birthday and before the\n21st birthday of the adopted child, where such adoptive parent or parents were\nreceiving adoption subsidy payments at the time of death, such subsidy payments\nmust continue, but must be made to the guardian of the child on behalf of such\nchild, where the child consents to the appointment of a guardian. Such subsidy\npayments must be made retroactively from the death of the adoptive parent or\nparents to the appointment of a guardian, and must continue until the 21st\nbirthday of the child. If, however, there is no willing or suitable person to\nbe appointed as guardian, or the child does not consent to the appointment of a\nguardian, such subsidy payments must be made retroactively from the death of\nthe adoptive parent or parents and must continue to be made until the 21st\nbirthday of the child: (1)\nthrough direct\npayments to the child, if the social services official determines that the\nchild demonstrates the ability to manage such direct payments; or\n(2)\nto a representative payee certified by\nthe social services official. (b) Upon receipt of notification of the death\nof the sole or surviving adoptive parent or both adoptive parents after the\n18th birthday and before the 21st birthday of the adopted child, where such\nadoptive parent or parents were receiving adoption subsidy payments at the time\nof death, the social services official must notify the child of: (1)\nthe processes available to continue\nsubsidy payments until the 21st birthday of the child including appointment of\na guardian under the Surrogate's Court Procedure Act, application to be\napproved for direct subsidy payments, or the appointment of a representative\npayee; and\n(2)\nthe right of the\nchild to be involved in all such processes. (c) Where the social services official has\ndetermined that the child does not demonstrate the ability to manage direct\nsubsidy payments, the social services official must certify payment to a\nrepresentative payee on behalf of the child. Subsidy payments received by the\nrepresentative payee must be held and used strictly for the use and benefit of\nthe child. Designation of the appropriate entity or individual and\ninvestigation of an individual for certification as a representative payee must\nbe conducted by the social services official responsible for payment of the\nadoption subsidy pursuant to this section. (1)\n\nThe social services official may\ndesignate an employee of the social services district to be the representative\npayee responsible for receipt of the adoption subsidy on behalf of the child\nonly where the official determines that such employee has no conflict of\ninterest in performing the duties and obligations as representative payee. If\nthe child resides in a social services district other than the district\nresponsible for payment of the adoption subsidy, the social services district\nin which the child resides may be designated the representative payee and a\nsocial services official of such district must select an employee of such\nsocial services district to be responsible for receipt of the adoption subsidy\nas the representative payee, only where the official determines that such\nemployee has no conflict of interest in performing the duties and obligations\nas a payee. Where a voluntary authorized agency has a prior relationship with a\nchild, or where the social services district does not have sufficient or\nappropriate staff available to perform the functions of the representative\npayee, the social services district may contract with a voluntary authorized\nagency as the representative payee on behalf of the child where the social\nservices district determines it would be in the best interests of the child to\ndo so. (2)\n\nThe social services\nofficial may designate an individual for certification as a representative\npayee who must perform the functions and duties of a representative payee in\naccordance with the best interests of the child. In determining whether an\nindividual is appropriate to be certified as the representative payee, the\nsocial services official must first consult with the child and must give the\nchild's preferences significant weight. The child's preference must be\ndeterminative of the representative payee only where such preference does not\nconflict with the best interests of the child. Prior to designation of an\nindividual by the social services official for certification as a\nrepresentative payee, the social services official must: (i) collect proof of identity and a\nverifiable social security number of the nominated representative\npayee; (ii)\nconduct an in-person\ninterview of the individual; (iii)\ninvestigate any potential conflicts of interest that may ensue if such\nindividual is certified; and\n(iv)\ndetermine the capabilities and qualifications of the individual to manage the\nsubsidy payment for the child. (3)\n(i) If, after completion of the investigation, the social services official is\nsatisfied that the individual is qualified, appropriate and will serve the best\ninterests of the child, the social services official must certify the selected\nindividual as the representative payee for the child. (ii)\n\nIf the 21st birthday of the child occurs\nwhile awaiting the certification of a representative payee, the child is\nentitled to retroactive direct payment of subsidy payments since the death of\nthe adoptive parent or parents after the 18th birthday of the\nchild. (4)\n\nThe\nrepresentative payee must submit reports to the social services official no\nless than once a year describing the use of the payments in the preceding year. Such reports must be submitted by December 31st of each year. The social\nservices official may also request reports from time to time from the\nrepresentative payee. If a representative payee fails to submit a report, the\nsocial services official may require that the representative payee appear in\nperson to collect payments. The social services official must keep a\ncentralized file and update it periodically with information including the\naddresses and social security or tax-payer identification numbers of the\nrepresentative payee and the child. (5)\n\nThe social services official must revoke\nthe certification of a representative payee upon: (i) determining that the representative payee\nhas misused the payments intended for the benefit of the child; (ii)\nthe failure of the representative payee\nto submit timely reports or appear in person as required by the social services\nofficial after such failure; or\n(iii)\nthe request of the child upon good\ncause shown. (6)\n\nThe\nsocial services official must notify the child of the contact information of\nthe representative payee within five days of making a decision. (7)\nA child may appeal the refusal of the\nsocial services official to certify the individual preferred by the child for\ncertification as the representative payee or revoke the certification of a\nrepresentative payee upon request of the child pursuant to section 455 of the\n\nSocial Service Law. (19)\n\nThe social services official on an\nannual basis in a written notification must remind the adoptive parents of\ntheir obligation to support the adopted child and to notify the social services\nofficial if the adoptive parents are no longer providing any support or are no\nlonger legally responsible for the support of the child. Where the adopted\nchild is school age under the laws of the state in which the child resides, such notification must include a requirement that the adoptive parents must\ncertify that the adopted child is a full-time elementary or secondary student\nor has completed secondary education. For the purposes of this paragraph, an\nelementary or secondary school student\nmeans an adopted child\nwho is: (i) enrolled, or in the process of\nenrolling, in a school which provides elementary or secondary education, in\naccordance with the laws where the school is located; (ii)\ninstructed in elementary or secondary\neducation at home, in accordance with the laws in which the adopted child's\nhome is located; (iii)\nin an\nindependent study elementary or secondary education program, in accordance with\nthe laws in which the adopted child's education program is located, which is\nadministered by the local school or school district; or\n(iv)\nincapable of attending school on a\nfull-time basis due to the adopted child's medical condition, which incapacity\nis supported by annual information submitted by the adoptive parents as part of\nthis certification. (d) Payments for nonrecurring adoption\nexpenses. (1)\n\nNonrecurring expenses\nmeans reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, the\ncosts of an adoption study, including health and psychological examinations and\nconsultations, the cost of supervising an adoption placement, transportation\ncosts, the reasonable costs of lodging and food for a child and his or her\nadoptive parent(s), which are incurred by or on behalf of the adoptive\nparent(s) and not otherwise reimbursed from other sources, which are directly\nrelated to the legal adoption of a child with special needs and which are not\nincurred in violation of Federal law or the laws of this State or any other\nstate. (2)\n\nAs used in this\nsubdivision, a\nchild with special needs\nmeans a child who: (i) the State has determined cannot or shall\nnot be returned to the home of his or her parents; (ii)\nis handicapped as defined in paragraph\n(a)(2) of this section or is hard-to-place as defined in subparagraph\n(a)(3)(iii) of this section; and\n(iii)\na reasonable but unsuccessful effort\nhas been made to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents without\nadoption assistance, except where such an effort would not be in the best\ninterest of the child. (3)\nA social services official must make a\npayment for nonrecurring adoption expenses incurred by or on behalf of adoptive\nparents in connection with the adoption of a child with special needs through\nan authorized agency. The payment for nonrecurring expenses will be made as a\none-time payment, not to exceed $2,000. (4)\n\nPayments for nonrecurring adoption\nexpenses must be made either to the adoptive parents directly, to an authorized\nagency on behalf of the adoptive parents or to an attorney on behalf of the\nadoptive parents for the allowable amount of attorney's fees or court costs\nincurred in connection with a completed adoption. Such payments must also be\nmade when a child is placed from this State by an authorized agency and is\nadopted in another state, and the adoptive parent(s) are not eligible for\nnonrecurring expenses in the other state, but are otherwise eligible for\nnonrecurring expenses in this State. (5)\n\nPayment for nonrecurring adoption\nexpenses must be made pursuant to a written agreement signed prior to the final\ndecree of adoption. (6)\n\nRepealed\nand Reserved. (7)\n\nThe agreement for\npayment of nonrecurring adoption expenses may be part of the adoption subsidy\nagreement or may be a separate agreement for those who will not receive an\nadoption subsidy. The agreement for the payment of nonrecurring adoption\nexpenses must include, but is not limited to, the following: (i) the nature and amount of any payments to\nbe provided for nonrecurring adoption expenses; (ii)\nthe condition(s) which make a child \"a\nchild with special needs\" as defined in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision; (iii)\na provision that\nthe payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses will be made as a one-time\npayment, not to exceed a maximum of $2,000; (iv)\na provision that the agreement will\nremain in effect if the adoptive parents move to another state; and\n(v) a provision for the protection of the\ninterests of the child where the adoptive parent(s) and the child move to\nanother state while the agreement is effective. (8)\n\nDocumentation of the nonrecurring\nadoption expenses, defined in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, must be\nprovided by the adoptive parent(s) to a social services official or authorized\nagency so that the amount of the payment for nonrecurring adoption expenses may\nbe determined. Such documentation must be in the form of receipts or written\nverification of services received and paid for, or services rendered or being\nrendered but for which payment has not been made. Except for adoptions\nspecified in paragraph (5) of this subdivision, all receipts or verifications\nmust be received by the social services official or authorized agency with whom\nthe adoptive parents have signed an agreement within two years of the date of\nthe final adoption decree. (9)\n\nAll\nwritten agreements for the payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses must be\nsubmitted to the department for approval or disapproval. The procedures\ncontained in paragraph (c)(13) of this section will apply to the approval or\ndisapproval of agreements for the payment of nonrecurring adoption\nexpenses. (e) Medical subsidy payments. (1)\n\nAny child with respect to whom payments made for care and maintenance under\nsubdivision (c) of this section are federally reimbursable shall be deemed a\nrecipient of aid to families with dependent children for purposes of\ndetermining eligibility for medical assistance. Payments for medical care, services and supplies for all such eligible children shall be made under and in\naccordance with the provisions of the State's program of medical assistance in\n\nArticles 3 and 4 of Subchapter E of this Title.

For the purposes\nof this subdivision, a handicapped child\nshall include, but\nnot be limited to, a child with special needs where a social services official\nhas determined that the child cannot be placed with an adoptive parent or\nparents without medical subsidy because such child has special needs for\nmedical, mental health or rehabilitative care. (ii)\n\nPayments made for medical care, services\nand supplies for a handicapped child shall be made only pursuant to written\nagreement between the social services official and the person(s) adopting the\nhandicapped child. (iii)\nA written\nagreement for medical subsidy payments made under the provisions of this\nsubdivision shall remain in effect until the child's 21st birthday, provided\nthat the child continues to reside in the home of the person(s) with whom the\nagreement is made or remains financially dependent on such person(s), except as\nmay otherwise be provided in this section. (iv)\n\nMedical subsidy payments shall be made\nonly for the costs of such care, services and supplies as may be authorized\nunder the State's program of medical assistance for needy persons according to\nthe provisions of Articles 3 and 4 of Subchapter E of this Title.

(vi)\n\nMedical subsidy payments may not be\nlimited to the particular condition for which a child was determined to be a\nhandicapped child, but shall be made for all care, services and supplies\npayable under the State's program of medical assistance of needy\npersons. (vii)\n\nPayments for medical\ncare, services and supplies for a handicapped child shall be made only where\nthe person(s) adopting the child has/have applied for such payments prior to\nthe child's adoption, provided that an application may be made subsequent to\nthe adoption if the person(s) adopting the child first became aware of the\nchild's condition or disability subsequent to the adoption and a physician\ncertifies that the condition or disability existed prior to the child's\nadoption. (viii)\n\nNeither the\napplication for, nor the agreement for medical subsidy payments shall require\napproval by the Office of Children and Family Services. (ix)\n\nThe agreement for medical subsidy\npayments shall not be subject to review or change, except that the social\nservices official shall request, at the social services official's discretion, either annually and/or at the submission of any claim, information about\nmedical insurance or other coverage from the adopting person(s) in order to\ndetermine compliance with subparagraph (v) of this paragraph.

(4)\n\nUpon the death of persons who have\nadopted the child prior to the 21st birthday of the child: (i) the payments made pursuant to this\nsubdivision shall continue and shall be made to the legal guardian of the child\nuntil the child has attained the age of 21; (ii)\nthe assistance provided pursuant to this\nsubdivision shall continue in the form of a medical subsidy payment to the\nlegal guardian of the child until the child has attained the age of 21, if the\nchild would otherwise have been eligible for a medical subsidy at the time of\nthe application for an adoption subsidy; and\n(iii)\nprovided the child is not eligible for\nmedical assistance, the appropriate social services official shall make medical\nsubsidy payments on behalf of a child who, upon the finalization of the\nadoption, was receiving federally reimbursable adoption assistance payments. Such payments may be paid to the legal guardian of the child until the child\nhas attained the age of 21, provided the child would otherwise have been\neligible for a medical subsidy at the time of the application for an adoption\nsubsidy, or may be paid directly to a provider of medical care, services or\nsupplies rather than to the legal guardian. (5)\n\nAll provisions of this section applicable\nto medical subsidy payments made to persons who adopted the child shall be\napplicable to medical subsidy payments made to the legal guardian of the\nchild. (f) Payments\nto out-of-state adoptive parents.

The written agreement\nshall be in accord with the provisions of this subdivision. Payments made to\nadoptive parents resident of another state or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\nshall be made to the adoptive parents at the out-of-state address. (3)\n\nAn adoption subsidy agreement shall\nbecome void at such time as it is determined by a social services official that\na child, on whose behalf payments for care and maintenance and/or medical care\nare being made pursuant to provisions of this section, was brought into this\n\nState for the sole purpose of qualifying the out-of-state adoptive parents for\nsuch payments. (4)\nA social\nservices official who makes a determination pursuant to paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision shall advise the adoptive parent(s) of his decision and shall\nadvise the adoptive parent(s) that the determination may be appealed according\nto the provisions of section\n455\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law and Part 358 of this Title.
