  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 68.7 - Management of CWD positive, exposed or suspect herds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Premises quarantine. If a CWD positive, exposed or suspect susceptible cervid is\nidentified in a herd, it shall be subject to immediate quarantine by a\ndepartment or USDA/APHIS official. Epidemiologic investigations shall be\ninitiated to determine possible sources and potential contacts. All contact\npremises shall be evaluated for CWD status. All herds epidemiologically linked\nto the positive herd shall be subject to quarantine and management as CWD\nexposed herds. (b) Establishment of a CWD herd plan. CWD herd plans shall be developed for any CWD positive, exposed or suspect herd. Such plans shall be developed by department and\nUSDA/APHIS officials in conjunction with the herd owner and shall be subject to\nfinal approval by the department. Such plans shall contain the following\nprocedures for positive or trace herds, which shall be implemented within 60\ndays of diagnosis of CWD. (1)\nCWD\npositive herds. Captive cervid herds in which one or more of the cervids are\nclassified as CWD positive shall be subject to: (i) depopulation of the whole herd; and\n(ii)\ndevelopment of a CWD herd\nplan for each CWD positive herd diagnosed. Such plan shall include a CWD\npremises plan addressing possible environmental contamination and other\nlong-term considerations. A CWD premises plan shall include provisions for: (a) cleaning and disinfection; (b) future land use restrictions; (c) restocking constraints and timeframes; and\n(d) fencing requirements to\nprevent contact with wildlife. (2)\nCWD exposed or suspect herds. A\ndepartment or USDA/APHIS epidemiologist shall conduct a risk analysis of all\nCWD exposed or suspect herds. High risk herds shall be subject to depopulation. Lower risk herds shall be subject to quarantine under the following conditions: (i) Official herd quarantine. CWD exposed or\nsuspect herds in which the risk is undeveloped or undefined shall remain under\nquarantine for 60 months. No off-premises sales or movement shall occur for the\nduration of the quarantine period. Discovery of any CWD infected cervid during\nthe quarantine period shall result in conversion to CWD infected herd\nstatus. (ii)\n\nElimination of\nhigh-risk cervids within the herd. Herds that have received herd additions from\nsource herds subsequently found to be CWD infected shall have their CWD herd\ncertification status suspended. The suspect herd additions shall be euthanized\nand appropriate samples shall be submitted for CWD testing. If there is no\nevidence of CWD following official testing, the herd status shall be restored. If the cervid is CWD positive, the herd shall be classified as a CWD positive\nherd and managed in accordance with this Part. (iii)\n\nSpecial fencing requirements. Perimeter\nfencing adequate to prevent fence line contact with captive and free-ranging\ncervids shall be established for all CWD positive herds and positive premises. Fencing requirements and biosecurity provisions shall be specified in the herd\nand premises plan. (3)\n\nDisposal. The carcasses of CWD positive cervids that are depopulated shall be\ndisposed of in accordance with disposal plans approved by the department and\nUSDA/APHIS. Such plans shall be developed to prevent contamination of the\nenvironment and exposure of live cervids. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
