Counsel shall be provided\nunless the person is conclusively ineligible based upon the criteria in this\nsection. The provisions of this section shall be applied uniformly, consistently, and with transparency. (a) Timely access to counsel. 1). Counsel shall be provided at the first\ncourt appearance or immediately following the request for counsel, whichever is\nearlier. Eligibility determinations shall be made in a timely fashion so that\nrepresentation by counsel is not delayed. 2). Counsel shall be provided to persons who\nhave not obtained counsel prior to initiation of a proceeding which may result\nin detention, in removal of children from their care or where there is an\nunavoidable delay in the eligibility determination, subject to judicial\napproval once the court proceeding has begun. For timely access to counsel, a\nperson seeking counsel prior to the filing of a petition shall be provided with\nthe contact information of the entity which has the primary responsibility in\nthe jurisdiction for providing representation. 3). A parent or legally responsible person, as defined by law, shall be entitled to and provided with immediate\nrepresentation by counsel: (i) upon the filing\nof a petition or pre-petition request under Article 10 of the Family Court Act\nfor an order for immediate removal of a child or temporary order of\nprotection; (ii)\nwhere the court\nhas received notice of an extra-judicial emergency removal of a child; or\n(iii)\nupon the filing of a\npetition alleging abuse or neglect against the parent or person legally\nresponsible. In accordance with this entitlement, counsel shall be provided\nsufficiently in advance of the person's first court appearance, and shall also\nbe provided for parents during a child protective agency investigation, consistent with paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (b) Presumptions of eligibility. The following presumptions of eligibility shall\napply and are rebuttable only where there is compelling evidence that the\nperson seeking counsel has the financial resources sufficient to pay for a\nqualified private attorney, the expenses necessary for effective representation\nin this and related proceedings, and the reasonable living expenses of the\nparty and any dependents in the relevant jurisdiction: 1). The person's net income is at or below\n250% of the Federal Poverty Guidelines, provided, however, that a person with\nan income in excess of 250% of the guidelines shall not be denied counsel if\nother criteria are met; 2). The\nperson is incarcerated, detained, or confined to a mental health\ninstitution; 3). The person is\ncurrently receiving, or has recently been deemed eligible pending receipt of, need-based public assistance, including but not limited to Family Assistance\n(TANF), Safety Net Assistance (SNA), Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (SNAP), Supplemental Security Income (SSI)/New York State Supplemental Program (SSP), Medicaid, or Public Housing assistance; or\n4). The person has, within the past six\nmonths, been deemed financially eligible for counsel in another court\nproceeding in that jurisdiction or another jurisdiction. (c) Additional considerations. The following\nfactors shall be considered in determining a person's financial eligibility for\npublicly funded counsel: 1). Debts and other\nfinancial obligations, including the obligation to provide reasonable living\nexpenses of the person and his or her dependents in the relevant jurisdiction; and\n2). The actual cost of\nretaining a private attorney in the relevant jurisdiction for the type of\nmatter for which publicly funded counsel is sought. (d) Exclusions from assets of an applicant\nseeking publicly funded counsel. 1). Non-liquid assets shall not be considered unless such assets have demonstrable\nmonetary value and are readily convertible to cash without impairing the\nperson's ability to provide for the reasonable living expenses of themselves\nand their dependents in the relevant jurisdiction. Ownership of a vehicle shall\nnot be considered where such vehicle is necessary for basic life activities. The person's primary residence shall not be considered unless the fair market\nvalue of the home is significant, there is substantial equity in the home, and\nthe person is able to access the equity in an amount and within a timeframe\nsufficient to retain private counsel promptly. 2). Any income from receipt of child support\nor need-based public assistance shall not be considered in determining\neligibility for publicly funded counsel. 3). Third-party resources. The resources of a\nthird party shall not be considered available to the person seeking publicly\nfunded counsel unless the third party expressly states a present intention to\npay for counsel, the person seeking counsel gives informed consent to this\narrangement, and the arrangement does not interfere with the person's\nrepresentation or jeopardize the confidentiality of the attorney-client\nrelationship. Neither the resources of a spouse nor the resources of a parent\nof a person seeking publicly funded counsel shall be considered, except as\nprovided in this subdivision. (e) Process for determining eligibility. 1). Each judicial district shall establish a\nprocess for determining eligibility in accordance with this rule and which\nutilizes a screening tool promulgated and approved by the Chief Administrative\n\nJudge. The court has the ultimate authority to determine eligibility but may\ndelegate the responsibility for screening and making an eligibility\nrecommendation to entities that are independent and conflict-free, including, but not limited to, entities providing representation. 2). The eligibility process, including the\ndocumentation required to be submitted, shall not be unduly burdensome for the\nperson seeking publicly funded counsel. Counsel shall not be denied where the\nperson has made a good faith, but unsuccessful, effort to produce required\ndocumentation or has made minor inadvertent or technical errors. Nor shall a\nperson be required to demonstrate an unsuccessful effort to retain private\ncounsel to be deemed financially eligible for publicly funded\ncounsel. 3). The court or delegated\nscreening entity shall preserve the confidentiality of the information\npresented as part of the financial eligibility determination and shall take\nsteps to ensure that the screening and determination are done in a confidential\nsetting and that information identifying the person seeking counsel is not\naccessible to the public or other parties, except as otherwise provided by the\ncourt. (f) Reconsideration and review of a denial of publicly funded counsel or expenses. 1). A determination denying counsel by either\nthe court or delegated screening entity or a determination by the court denying\nexpenses under section\n722-c\nof the\n\nCounty Law shall be in writing, shall include reasons for the denial and\nprocedure for seeking reconsideration, and shall be provided to the person\nseeking counsel or expenses. 2). In\naddition to a procedure for seeking prompt reconsideration from the court or\ndelegated screening entity, each judicial district shall establish a procedure\nfor prompt supervisory administrative review upon request by a person who has\nbeen denied publicly funded counsel under section\n722-b\nof the\n\nCounty Law or expenses under section\n722-c\nof the\n\nCounty Law or for whom an order for payment under section\n722-d\nof the\n\nCounty Law has been issued. These procedures shall be in writing, shall be\nposted on the judiciary's public website and in each courthouse, and shall be\nfurnished to any person who has been denied publicly funded counsel or expenses\nor who has been issued an order directing payment under sections\n722-b, 722-c\nor\n722-d\nof the\n\nCounty Law, respectively. (g) Nothing in this rule shall impair or\nprevent a party from seeking or obtaining an award of counsel fees and expenses\nas a non-monied spouse, former spouse or parent for counsel of their choice\npursuant to section\n438\nof the\n\nFamily Court Act or section\n237\nof\nthe Domestic Relations Law, instead and in place of publicly funded counsel\npursuant to section\n262\nof the\n\nFamily Court Act or section\n35\n(8)\nof the Judiciary\n\nLaw.
