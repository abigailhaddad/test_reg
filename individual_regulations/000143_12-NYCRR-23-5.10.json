  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-5.10 - Multiple-point suspension scaffolds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Design. (1)\n\nEvery multiple-point suspension scaffold, including all its supports and fastenings, shall be designed by a professional\nengineer licensed to practice in the State of New York. A copy of the typical\ndrawings and all specifications, signed by such professional engineer, shall be\nkept on the job site available for examination by the commissioner. (2)\n\nEvery multiple-point suspension scaffold\nshall be designed and constructed with a factor of safety in compliance with\nthe Labor Law and this Part (rule), except that wire ropes supporting the\nplatform shall be at least five-sixteenths inch in diameter and capable of\nsupporting at least six times the load intended to be imposed on such\nscaffold. (3)\n\nEvery multiple-point\nsuspension scaffold shall be provided with an approved hoisting\nmachine. (4)\n\nOutrigger beams and\nplatform bearers of multiple-point suspension scaffolds shall be constructed of\nstructural grade metal. A detailed inspection of each such beam or bearer shall\nbe made prior to installation and use and such inspection shall be repeated at\nintervals of not more than 30 days during scaffold use. Such inspections shall\nbe made by competent designated persons who shall complete and sign a written\nrecord of the results of each such inspection. Such written record shall be\nkept at the job site available for examination by the commissioner. (5)\n\nPlatform supports of multiple-point\nsuspension scaffolds shall be designed to provide sufficient headroom for easy\npassage throughout the lengths of such scaffolds. (6)\n\nEffective means shall be provided to\nprevent rope supports from slipping off the ends of the outrigger\nbeams. (b) Installation\nof multiple-point suspension scaffolds. (1)\n\nEach such scaffold shall be installed in accordance with the required design\ndrawings. Any installation or relocation of a multiple-point suspension\nscaffold shall be by or under the direct supervision of a competent designated\nperson. (2)\n\nThe overhang of\noutrigger beams on such scaffolds shall at no time exceed that specified on the\nrequired design drawings. (3)\n\nOutrigger beams shall be properly anchored and braced to provide rigidity and\nto prevent sliding or tipping. (4)\n\nSupporting points for outrigger beams shall be level, smooth and of sufficient\nareas to provide firm seats. (5)\n\nWire rope connections shall be in compliance with this Part (rule). At least\nfour turns of the wire rope shall remain on the hoisting drum at all times. The\nforegoing does not apply to traction type hoists. (6)\n\nThe hoisting rope of every multiple-point\nsuspension scaffold shall be maintained properly lubricated. (c) Scaffold platform. The\nplatform of every medium duty multiple-point suspension scaffold shall be at\nleast equivalent in strength to two-inch planking, full size. Such planking\nshall be laid tight and shall be fastened in place or cleated to prevent\ndislodgment. Light duty multiple- point suspension scaffolds shall be provided\nwith ladder type platforms constructed in accordance with the schedule listed\nin Table XII of this Subpart and securely fastened to the hangers by U- bolts\nor other equivalent means. (d) Safety railings and screening. (1)\n\nThe open\nside and ends of every multiple-point suspension scaffold shall be provided\nwith a safety railing constructed and installed in compliance with this Part\n(rule). In addition, every such safety railing shall be provided with an\nenclosure of wire mesh installed from the toeboard to the top railing. Such\nwire mesh shall be not less than No. 18 U.S. gage steel with openings that will\nreject a one-inch diameter ball. (2)\n\nThe inboard side (side next to the\nbuilding or other structure) of every multiple-point suspension scaffold shall\nbe provided with a toeboard. (e) Overhead protection. Where there is a\nhazard from falling objects or materials, multiple-point suspension scaffolds\nshall be provided with overhead protection in compliance with this Part\n(rule). (f) Scaffold dismantling. When a multiple-point suspension scaffold is being dismantled and the scaffold\nplatform is not lowered intact to the ground or other safe surface, each person\nperforming such dismantling shall be provided with and shall use an approved\nsafety belt or harness together with a lifeline in compliance with this Part\n(rule).
