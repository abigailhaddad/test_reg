Tit. 9 § 6.11 - Executive order no. 11: establishing the new york state commission on local government efficiency and competitiveness\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, New York's local governments are established and\noperate under New York's Constitution, statutes and regulations and receive\nfinancial and governance support from the State; and\nWHEREAS, local governments, including counties, towns, cities, villages and special purpose districts, such as school and fire\ndistricts, provide many of the public services which determine whether New\n\nYork's residents and businesses live and conduct commerce safely, healthily, productively and happily; and\nWHEREAS, New York's local governments, including more than\n4200 taxing jurisdictions, have evolved over centuries, and in many cases\nreflect circumstances, population concentrations and needs which have changed\nsignificantly or no longer exist; and\nWHEREAS, the sheer number of such taxing jurisdictions and\ntheir overlapping and multi-layered nature cause public services to be\nexcessively expensive, and provided in a manner that is inefficient and reduces\nthe competitiveness of New York's localities and the job and business\nopportunities for New Yorkers; and\nWHEREAS, many New Yorkers are unaware of the boundaries and\nvery existence of many taxing jurisdictions and special districts, and this\nresults in an extraordinarily low level of participation in many local\ngovernment elections; and\nWHEREAS, the opportunities for smart growth and\nregionalization of the delivery of certain public services such as public\ntransportation, waste management, information technology and water supply are\noften inhibited by New York's fragmented local government structure; and\nWHEREAS, New York's local tax burden is the highest in the\n\nUnited States and negatively impacts competitiveness and the quality of life; and\nWHEREAS, New York's laws, regulations and programs have\nbeen only minimally effective in assisting local governments to partner in the\nefficient delivery of public services, to merge, consolidate or regionalize\nlocal government, to adopt smart growth practices, and otherwise improve the\nliving environment for New Yorkers; and\nWHEREAS, a comprehensive analysis is needed: 1. to identify the barriers which inhibit\nmore efficient local government, the merger, consolidation or regionalization\nof local government, partnering among local governments to more efficiently\nprovide public services, adoption of smart growth practices, and the\nprocurement and construction of regional transportation and other\ninfrastructure which improves the efficiency, competitiveness and quality of\nlife of New York's localities; and\n2. to guide the formulation and development\nof tools to assist local governments to pursue and achieve these objectives; NOW THEREFORE, I, Eliot Spitzer, Governor of the State Of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws\nof the State of New York do hereby order as follows: 1.
