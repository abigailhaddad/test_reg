Tit. 7 § 1800.10 - Removal from shock incarceration program\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An inmate's privilege to continue to\nparticipate in the shock incarceration program may be revoked at the sole\ndiscretion of the commissioner or his designee, the deputy commissioner for\nfacility operations or the director of shock development or upon recommendation\nof the shock incarceration correctional facility's superintendent's committee. The superintendent's committee shall consist of at least three persons\nappointed by the superintendent and approved by the deputy commissioner for\nfacility operations. (b) Procedure\nbefore superintendent's committee. Upon receiving a request to review a\nparticipant's unsatisfactory or deteriorating adjustment in the shock\nincarceration program, the chairperson of the superintendent's committee will\nevaluate the referral and schedule a meeting of the superintendent's committee\nin accordance with the urgency of the referral. If the inmate has not had a\ndisciplinary violation sustained via a disciplinary hearing pursuant to Part\n253 or 254 of this Title, the inmate shall be interviewed by the committee. This interview may be by telephonic means if, for security reasons, the inmate\nhas already been transferred to another correctional facility. The purpose of\nthis interview is to give the inmate the opportunity to discuss his program\nparticipation. The chairperson shall give the inmate a written statement of the\nreasons for his referral to the superintendent's committee and a written record\nshall be made of the inmate being served with this notice. (c) Post-disciplinary hearing cases. The\ndisciplinary hearing officer at either a Tier II or Tier III hearing may, as a\ndisposition, refer an inmate's case to the superintendent's committee for\nreview. In such cases, the superintendent's committee shall make a\nrecommendation to the superintendent concerning whether the inmate will be\nremoved from the program after review of the disciplinary hearing and any other\nmaterials the committee deems appropriate to review. The chairperson shall\nforward to the superintendent a written statement of such\nrecommendation. (d) Voluntary\nremoval. At any time an inmate may request in writing to be removed from the\nshock incarceration program. Such request will be processed as a transfer\nrequest. The requesting inmate will be transferred to a general confinement\ncorrectional facility to continue the court-imposed sentence. (e) Any inmate who is eligible for the shock\nincarceration program who chooses not to participate in it, or who is removed\nfrom the program will be considered ineligible for participation in the\ntemporary release program, unless the reason for the removal was due to an\nintervening circumstance beyond the control of the inmate.
