  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-7.4 - Capital losses sustained in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In\ncomputing the business income base, taxpayers generally start with Federal\ntaxable income that includes capital gains in excess of capital losses without\ndifferentiation between New York investment capital gains and losses and New\n\nYork business capital gains and losses. For New York State purposes, taxpayers\nmust ensure that investment capital losses do not offset business capital gains\nand that business capital losses do not offset investment capital gains when\ncalculating the business income base. (b) A corporation or combined group, in the\ncase of a combined report, subject to tax under article 9-A must properly\nclassify and separate any amount of Federal capital losses and Federal capital\ngains, as such terms are defined in IRC section 1222, into New York business\ncapital gains or losses and New York investment capital gains or losses. To\ncalculate the business income base, Federal taxable income must be increased by\nthe amount of New York net investment capital loss that offsets New York net\nbusiness capital gains. Similarly, to calculate the business income base, Federal taxable income must be increased by the amount of New York net business\ncapital loss that offsets New York net investment capital gains. (c) For any amount of Federal capital loss\nsustained in an article 9-A New York non-filing year that is used on a Federal\nreturn in an article 9-A New York filing year, Federal taxable income in that\n\nNew York filing year must be increased by the amount of Federal capital loss\nthat was used from that article 9-A New York non-filing year. (d) For any amount of Federal capital loss\nsustained in a New York S year that is used on a Federal return in a New York C\nyear, Federal taxable income in that New York C year must be increased by the\namount of the Federal capital loss that was used from the New York S\nyear. (e) For any amount of Federal\ncapital loss sustained in a non-captive REIT filing year that is used on a\n\nFederal return in a captive REIT filing year, Federal taxable income in that\ncaptive REIT filing year must be increased by the amount of the Federal capital\nloss that was used from the non-captive REIT filing year. (f) For any amount of Federal capital loss\nsustained in a non-captive RIC filing year that is used on a Federal return in\na captive RIC filing year, Federal taxable income in that captive RIC filing\nyear must be increased by the amount of the Federal capital loss that was used\nfrom the non-captive RIC filing year. (g) For any amount of Federal capital loss\nsustained in a non-captive REIT filing year that is used on a Federal return in\na year that the corporation, trust, or association fails to meet the definition\nand requirements of a REIT, Federal taxable income in that filing year must be\nincreased by the amount of the Federal capital loss that was used from the\nnon-captive REIT filing year. (h) For any amount of Federal capital loss sustained in a non-combinable captive\ninsurance company filing year that is used on a Federal return in a combinable\ncaptive insurance company filing year, Federal taxable income in that\nnon-combinable captive insurance company filing year must be increased by the\namount of the Federal capital loss that was used from the combinable captive\nfiling year.
