  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 861.6A - Application of criteria for toxic pollutants\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Delaware River estuary. (1)\n\nIn establishing wasteload allocations and\nother effluent requirements, exceedances of stream quality objectives for the\nprotection of aquatic life from acute effects may be permitted in small areas\nnear outfall structures, provided that all of the following requirements are\nmet. (i) As a guideline, the dimensions of\nthe area where objectives are exceeded should be limited to the more stringent\nof the following restrictions: (a) a distance\nof 50 times the discharge length scale in any direction from the outfall\nstructure; or\n(b) a distance of\nfive times the local water depth in any direction from the outfall\nstructure. (ii)\n\nStream\nquality objectives shall not be exceeded in areas designated as critical\nhabitat for fish and benthic organisms. (iii)\n\nStream quality objectives shall not be\nexceeded where effluent flows over exposed benthic habitat prior to mixing with\nthe receiving waters. (iv)\nA zone\nof passage for free-swimming and drifting organisms equal to 50 percent of the\nsurface width of the river at the location of the discharge shall be\nprovided. (v) The total surface\narea of the Delaware River estuary where stream quality objectives for the\nprotection of aquatic life from acute effects are exceeded shall be limited to: (a) five percent of the total surface area of\nzones 2, 3 and 4; and\n(b) five\npercent of the total surface area of zone 5. (vi)\n\nUpon the request of one or more\ndischargers, the executive director may consider requests for alternatives to\nthe requirements of subparagraphs (i)-(v) of this paragraph. Such requests\nshall provide a demonstration that the alternative requirement requested will\nnot adversely impact free-swimming, drifting and benthic organisms. The\ndemonstration(s) shall provide a sound rationale, and be supported by\nsubstantial scientific data and analysis. The methodology and form of the\ndemonstration shall be approved by the executive director. The executive\ndirector may reject any requests which are not substantive. The commission may\nestablish alternative areas where acute stream quality objectives may be\nexceeded based upon the evaluation of submitted demonstrations. (vii)\n\nThe executive director may consider\nrequests to conduct studies to confirm the mixing characteristics and the\npredicted dilution isopleths of a discharge. Such requests shall provide a\ndemonstration based upon sound scientific and technical rationale, and be\nsupported by substantial data and analysis. The methodology and form of the\ndemonstration shall be approved by the executive director. The executive\ndirector may reject any requests which are not substantive. The commission may\nestablish alternative dilution factors based upon the evaluation of submitted\ndemonstrations. (2)\n\nFor\nthose stream quality objectives whose numerical value is related to hardness, a\nmedian hardness value of 74 mg/l as CaCO\n3\nshall be used\nto represent the hardness of the receiving water for the purposes of\ndetermining the numerical value of those objectives. This median hardness value\nshall be used to establish the aquatic life objective for protection from\nchronic effects; and in conjunction with the site-specific median hardness\nvalue of the effluent and the dilution factor, the aquatic life objective for\nprotection from acute effects. (3)\n\nFor those stream quality objectives whose numerical value is related to pH, a\nmedian pH value of 7.1 shall be used to represent the pH of the receiving water\nfor the purposes of determining the numerical value of those objectives. This\nmedian pH value shall be used to establish the aquatic life objective for\nprotection from chronic effects; and in conjunction with the site-specific\nmedian pH value of the effluent and the dilution factor, the aquatic life\nobjective for protection from acute effects. (4)\n\nAssumptions for estuarine mixing. Complete vertical and lateral mixing shall be assumed in the estuary in\napplying chronic aquatic life and human health stream quality objectives under\ndesign conditions. Site-specific data which does not support this assumption\nwill be considered by the executive director in establishing allocations to\ndischarges. (5)\n\nDeriving total\nrecoverable wasteload allocations for metals. Wasteload allocations developed\nfrom the dissolved stream quality objectives for seven cationic metals shall be\nconverted into total recoverable wasteload allocations using a translator. The\ntranslator shall be determined using procedures specified by the commission. In\nthe absence of data to develop a translator for any of the metals, the\nreciprocal of the conversion factor established under section\n860.3\n(c)(2)\nof\nthis Title shall be used for the translator. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nCritical habitat. Specific areas within\nthe tidal Delaware River which are or could be occupied by a species absent the\ntoxic effect of pollutants; and which have those physical, chemical and\nbiological features which are essential to the conservation and maintenance of\nthe Delaware estuary population. The commission shall identify and determine\ncritical habitat within the tidal Delaware River. Such determination shall\nconsider the spatial and temporal requirements of the species including\ncritical life stages. Determinations shall be governed by the commission's\nrules of practice and procedure relating to review, hearing and decisions of\nobjections thereto. (2)\n\nDischarge\nlength scale. The square root of the cross-sectional area of any discharge\noutlet. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n861.6A\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
