  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 690.99 - Glossary\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Administrator. A party holding qualified intellectual disability\nprofessional (QIDP) status, designated by the governing body to be responsible\nand accountable for the day-to-day operation of the day treatment\nfacility. (b) Administrator, assistant. A party who is a qualified intellectual disability\nprofessional (QIDP), who assists the administrator in the daily operation of\nthe program, and serves in place of the administrator in the administrator's\nabsence. (c) Admission. The formal acceptance of a person to the day treatment\nfacility, based on the recommendations of an interdisciplinary treatment team\nwhose conclusions are derived from a review of available assessments that are\ncurrent and acceptable to the team, or on preliminary screenings conducted by\nqualified professionals during the applicant's enrollment period. The decision\nto admit allows for an additional 21 working days for staff to develop or\ncomplete assessments and prepare the person's initial individual program\nplan. (d) Advocate. For the purposes of this Part, a party chosen to assist the\nperson with the development, implementation, review and revision of the\nservices, support, and activities that the person chooses in order to attain\nhis or personal life goals and the outcomes associated with his/ her individual\nprogram plan. The advocate must be 18 years or older and may include an\ninvolved parent or other member of the family, legal guardian, friend or member\nof the community who is not providing direct services to the person pursuant to\nthe individual program plan and who is not employed by an entity providing\ndirect services to the person. However, an ombudsperson at a development\ncenter, appointed pursuant to section\n13.34\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law, may also be considered as a person's choice for his/her\nadvocate. The fact that someone is functioning in the role of advocate for a\nperson does not endow that party with any legal authority over the person's\naffairs unless they also happen to be the adult person's guardian or the parent\nof a minor. (e) Agency. A unit of government, a voluntary not-for-profit corporation, or any other party or organization which intends to establish or operate a day\ntreatment facility for persons with developmental disabilities. (f) Agency/facility. As used in this Part, a term used to indicate that the stated\nrequirement needs to be considered in relation to the administrative structure\nof both the agency and the site- specific facility and acted upon accordingly. This is to be distinguished from the term\nagency\nused alone\nwhich means the \"agent\" or operator of a facility operated or certified by\nOPWDD. In the case of State-operated facilities, the Developmental Disabilities\n\nServices Offices (DDSO) is considered to be the \"agency.\"\n(g) Assessment. The process, supervised by appropriately qualified\nprofessionals, that identifies the present medical and/or developmental status\nof a person, including diagnosis; his or her capabilities, capacities and\nneeds; and the conditions that impact upon a person's development. Assessments\ninclude, but are not limited to, determination of a person's functional\ncapacities and adaptive behavior using primarily assessment techniques\n(\ne.g., interview, observation) and instruments appropriate to\nthe person in question as determined by the assessing clinician, but whenever\npossible having established empirically reliable and valid norms of\nperformance. All assessments which address at least the physical, mental and\npsychosocial functioning aspects of a person taken together, analyzed and\nsynthesized by the interdisciplinary treatment team, constitute a comprehensive\nfunctional assessment which forms the basis for developing an appropriate\nindividual program plan of therapies, interventions and activities. (h) Assessment comprehensive\nfunctional. In order to develop a person's individual program plan using\nan interdisciplinary treatment team process, it is necessary that the\ninterdisciplinary treatment team take into consideration a person's age and the\nimplications for active treatment, and, as part of that process must: (1)\nidentify the person's capabilities and\ndisabilities, and where possible, their causes; (2)\nidentify the person's specific\ndevelopmental strengths; (3)\nidentify the person's specific developmental and behavioral management\nneeds; (4)\nidentify the person's\nneed and preferences for services without regard to the actual availability of\nthe services needed; (5)\ninclude an\nassessment of physical development and health, nutritional status, sensorimotor\ndevelopment, affective development, speech and language development and\nauditory functioning, cognitive development, social development, adaptive\nbehaviors or independent living skills necessary for the person to be able to\nfunction in the community, and vocational skills, if applicable; and\n(6)\ninclude obtaining direct input from the\nperson himself/herself (as is feasible), and also from the person's\nparent/guardian or correspondent/advocate, as applicable in each circumstance. The completion of the comprehensive functional assessment\nprovides the team with the necessary information to address each person's needs\nin priority order, and focuses team decisions regarding each need. Annually\nthereafter, the comprehensive functional assessment is to be reviewed by the\ninterdisciplinary treatment team for relevancy and updated as needed, and the\nindividual program plan revised, as appropriate. (i) Behavior, adaptive. Results of an assessment, based on a standardized instrument, if such is deemed appropriate by the facility or clinical staff to the area\nbeing assessed, which indicate that a person evidences capabilities which can\nbe enhanced and deficits which can be ameliorated in one or more of the\nfollowing life activity areas: communication; mobility; learning; independent\nliving; self-care; health care and self-direction. (j) Body, governing. That policy making authority, established by the agency, which pursuant to section\n702\nof the Not-for-Profit Corporation Law\nand section\n702\nof\nthe Business Corporation Law, shall consist of at least three individuals that\nexercises general direction over the affairs of the program and establishes\noverall policies concerning its operation for the welfare of the persons it\nserves.

The number of full-time equivalent persons approved for the\nday treatment facility (or a certified satellite) to routinely provide day\ntreatment services to on a given day. That number, in terms of a site's (main\nor satellite) daily physical attendance, may only be exceeded\n(\ne.g., as the result of the practice of overbooking to address\nabsenteeism) on a non- routine basis, and as follows: (1)\n\nFacilities with certified capacity of\nless than 50: +2. (2)\n\nFacilities\nwith a certified capacity between 50 and 74: +3. (3)\n\nFacilities with a certified capacity\nbetween 75 and 99: +4. (4)\n\nFacilities with a certified capacity of 100 or greater: +5. In no event shall a facility claim reimbursement on a given\nday for a number of persons greater than the certified capacity as specified on\nthe operating certificate. (l) Commissioner. The commissioner of the New York State Office for People With\n\nDevelopmental Disabilities, or his or her designee. (m) Consistent. Relative to the requirements of section\n690.5\n(e)(1)\nof\nthis Part, means that whatever program activities the person is receiving from\nan other than ICF/DD provider are not contrary to, or working at cross purposes\nto, the activities or interventions, or therapies the person receives at the\nICF/DD. (n) Coordinator, treatment.

If the person's parents are deceased or their whereabouts\ncannot, with due diligence, be ascertained, or they have failed to designate an\nappropriate representative, and there is no guardian or committee, then the\ncorrespondent shall be defined as the relative or other party, if any, in the\nclosest relationship with the person who has at least once within the previous\nyear, manifested interest in the person by visiting the person or by\ncommunication with the facility regarding the person. (2)\n\nIf none of the above can be located, or\nif such party(ies) refuse to participate in the program planning process for\nthe person, the administrator, in accordance with the person's preference, shall designate a substitute to act as the person's correspondent, unless the\nperson is a Willowbrook Class Member.

Persons provided day treatment will attend regularly. A half-day\nprogram covers a period of three to five hours. A full-day program is more than\nfive hours. A partial day treatment visit of at least 90 minutes is available\nonly in collocated day treatment settings (see section\n690.1\n[d][2]\nof\nthis Part). Day treatment facilities may vary widely in the services offered, the level of disability of persons served, the staffing plan, the program goals\nand the types and numbers of cooperative agency relationships.
