  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 25.18 - [Effective 7/7/2025] Establishment of a continuing eligible list\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Chief Administrator of the Courts may\nestablish a continuing eligible list for any class of positions for which such\nlists are appropriate. The Chief Administrator may only establish continuing\neligible lists for any class of positions filled through open competitive\nexamination. Names of eligibles shall be inserted in such list from time to\ntime as applicants are tested and found qualified in examinations held at such\nintervals as may be prescribed by the Chief Administrator. Such successive\nexaminations shall, so far as practicable, be constructed and rated so as to be\nequivalent tests of the merit and fitness of candidates. The name of any\ncandidate who passes any such examination and who is otherwise qualified shall\nbe placed on the continuing eligible list in the rank corresponding to his or\nher final rating on such examination. The period of eligibility of successful\ncandidates for certification and appointment from such continuing eligible\nlist, as a result of any such examination, shall be fixed by the Chief\n\nAdministrator but, except as a list may reach an announced terminal date, such\nperiod shall not be less than one year; nor shall such period of eligibility\nexceed four years, except as provided in section\n25.17\nof this Part. Subject to\nsuch conditions and limitations as the Chief Administrator may prescribe, a\ncandidate may take more than one such examination; provided, however, that no\nsuch candidate shall be certified simultaneously with more than one rank on the\ncontinuing eligible list. With respect to any candidate who applies for and is\ngranted additional credit in any such examination as a disabled or nondisabled\nveteran, and for the limited purpose of granting such additional credit, the\neligible list shall be deemed to be established on the date on which his or her\nname is added thereto.
