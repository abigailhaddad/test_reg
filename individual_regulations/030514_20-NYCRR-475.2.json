Thereafter the motor vehicle cannot be operated on the public\nhighways of this State.

Accordingly, upon suspension or revocation of a permit all the permits and\nplates and stickers issued to the carrier for all motor vehicles must be\nsurrendered immediately to the commission and such vehicles cannot be operated\non the public highways of this State. (c) If the permit of any motor vehicle\nregistered in this State has been suspended or revoked, the Department of Motor\n\nVehicles will not thereafter re-register the motor vehicle or transfer the\nregistration of ownership, until the commission issues to the department a\ncertificate to the effect that such person has fully complied with the\nprovisions of article 21 of the Tax Law.
