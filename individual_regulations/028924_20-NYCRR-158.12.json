  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 158.12 - Requirements applicable to tax return preparer\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 658(g)\n(a) Signing of New York State income\ntax returns and claims for refunds prepared by a person other than the\ntaxpayer. (1)\n\nFor purposes of section\n658 (g)(1)\nof the Tax Law, which requires the signature of a tax return preparer on certain returns and\nclaims for refund, such tax return preparer must sign such return or claim for\nrefund (which may be a duplicate) in the appropriate space provided on the\nreturn or claim for refund after it is completed and before it is presented to\nthe taxpayer (or nontaxable entity) for signature. The preparer shall sign the\nreturn or claim for refund in the manner prescribed in forms, instructions, or\nother appropriate guidance of the Department of Taxation and Finance. Also, in\naccordance with section\n658 (g)(2)\nof the Tax Law, which requires tax return preparers to include identifying numbers on certain\nreturns and claims for refund, any such return or claim for refund prepared by\na tax return preparer shall bear such identifying number\n(\ni.e., social security number, Federal preparer tax\nidentification number and/or employer identification number) necessary for\nsecuring proper identification of such preparer, such preparer's employer, or\nboth, as may be required by forms and instructions of the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance. Where the preparer is unavailable for signature, another\npreparer must review the entire preparation of the return or claim for refund\nand then must sign such return or claim for refund and furnish the identifying\nnumber(s) required by section\n658 (g)(2)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (2)\n\nWhere more than one income\ntax return preparer is involved in the preparation of the New York State income\ntax return or claim for refund, the individual preparer who has the primary\nresponsibility as between or among the preparers for the overall substantive\naccuracy of the preparation of such return or claim for refund shall be\nconsidered to be the income tax return preparer for purposes of the signature\nrequirements of this section. (3)\n\nEach New York State income tax return or claim for refund which is prepared by\none (or more) income tax return preparer(s) must have typed or printed the\nname(s) of the individual income tax return preparer(s) or the name of the firm\n(if applicable), the street address, city, state, and postal ZIP code of such\npreparer' s place of business where the preparation of the New York State\nincome tax return or claim for refund was completed. Where such place of\nbusiness is not maintained on a year-round basis, such return or such claim for\nrefund shall bear the street address, city, state, and postal ZIP code of the\npreparer's principal office or business location which is maintained on a\nyear-round basis or, if none, the preparer's residence. (4)\n(i) The\nsignature requirement of this subdivision may be satisfied by a photocopy of a\nduplicate of the New York State income tax return or claim for refund, which\nduplicate is signed by the preparer after completion of such return's or such\nclaim for refund's preparation. After a duplicate of the New York State income\ntax return or claim for refund is signed by the preparer and before such return\nor such claim for refund is photocopied, no person other than the preparer may\nalter any entries on such duplicate other than to correct arithmetical errors\ndiscernible on such return or such claim for refund. The employer of the\npreparer or the partnership in which the preparer is a partner, or the preparer\n(if not employed or engaged by a preparer and not a partner of a partnership\nwhich is a preparer), must retain the signed duplicate of the New York State\nincome tax return or claim for refund. A record of any arithmetical errors\ncorrected must be retained by the person required to retain the signed\nduplicate of the New York State income tax return or claim for refund and be\nmade available upon request by the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. (ii)\n\nWhere mechanical\npreparation of the New York State income tax return or claim for refund is\naccomplished by computer not under the control of the individual preparer, then\nthe signature requirement of this subdivision may be satisfied by a signed\nattestation by the individual preparer attached to such return or such claim\nfor refund that all the information contained in such return or such claim for\nrefund was obtained from the taxpayer and is true and correct to the best of\nsuch preparer's knowledge, but only if such information (including any\nsupplemental written information provided and signed by such preparer) is not\naltered on such return or such claim for refund by another person. For purposes\nof the preceding sentence, the correction of arithmetical or clerical errors\ndiscernible from the information submitted by the preparer does not constitute\nan alteration. The information submitted by the preparer must be retained by\nthe employer of the preparer or by the partnership in which the preparer is a\npartner, or by the preparer (if not employed or engaged by a preparer and not a\npartner of a partnership which is a preparer). A record of any arithmetical or\nclerical errors corrected must be retained by the person required to retain the\ninformation submitted by the preparer and be made available upon request by the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. (iii)\n\nAny items required to be retained and\nkept available for inspection under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph must be retained and kept available for inspection for the same three\nyear retention period described in paragraph (d)(5) of this section. (iv)\n\nIf the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance determines that a preparer or preparers have abused the permissive\nsignature rules of this paragraph, such as by altering the New York State\nincome tax return or claim for refund after signature (in contravention of\nsubparagraph [i] of this paragraph) or by altering information on the New York\n\nState income tax return or claim for refund after attestation (in contravention\nof subparagraph [ii] of this paragraph), then the Department may, by written\nnotice, prospectively deny to the preparer or preparers the right to use these\npermissive signature rules. (b) Furnishing a copy of the New York\n\nState income tax return or claim for refund to the taxpayer. Any person who is an income tax preparer of any New\n\nYork State income tax return or claim for refund shall furnish a completed copy\nof the original New York State income tax return or claim for refund to the\ntaxpayer (or nontaxable entity) not later than the time the original New York\n\nState income tax return or claim for refund is presented for the signature of\nthe taxpayer (or nontaxable entity). Such preparer may, if such preparer\nwishes, request a receipt or other evidence from the taxpayer (or nontaxable\nentity) sufficient to show satisfaction of the requirement of this\nsubdivision. (c) Copy\nof New York State income tax return or claim for refund or list to be\nretained. Any person who is an income tax return preparer of any\n\nNew York State income tax return or claim for refund shall, for a three year\nretention period (see paragraph [d][5] of this section): (1)\n(i) retain a completed copy of the return or claim for refund; or\n(ii)\nretain a record, by list, card file, or\notherwise of the name, taxpayer identification number, and taxable year of the\ntaxpayer (or nontaxable entity) for whom the New York State income tax return\nor claim for refund was prepared and the type of New York State income Tax\nreturn or claim for refund prepared; (2)\nretain a record, by retention of a copy\nof the New York State income tax return or claim for refund, maintenance of a\nlist or card file, or otherwise, for each New York State income tax return or\nclaim for refund presented to the taxpayer (or nontaxable entity) of the name\nof the individual preparer required to sign the New York State income tax\nreturn or claim for refund in accordance with section\n658 (g)(1)\nof the Tax Law\n(see subdivision [a] of this section); and\n(3)\nmake such copy or record of New York\n\nState income tax returns and claims for refunds and such record of the\nindividuals required to sign available for inspection upon request of the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. (d) Meaning of terms. (1)\n\nPaid preparer defined. For purposes of\nthis section, an\nincome tax return preparer\nis any person who\nprepares for compensation, or who employs (or engages) one or more persons to\nprepare for compensation, other than for such person/employer, all or a\nsubstantial portion of any New York State income tax return (including any New\n\nYork State employer's return referred to in Part 174 of this Title) or claim\nfor refund required to be filed pursuant to article 22 of the Tax Law. (i) Substantial portion. (a) Only a person (or persons acting in\nconcert) who prepares all or a substantial portion of a New York State income\ntax return or claim for refund will be considered to be a preparer (or\npreparers) of such return or such claim for refund. A person who renders advice\nwhich is directly relevant to the determination of the existence, characterization or amount of an entry on a New York State income tax return or\nclaim for refund will be regarded as having prepared that entry, so long as\nsuch person has actual knowledge that the taxpayer utilized the advice rendered\non the New York State income tax return or claim for refund. Whether a\nschedule, entry or other portion of such return or such claim for refund is a\n\"substantial portion\" is determined by comparing the length and complexity of, and the tax liability or refund involved in, that portion to the length and\ncomplexity of and tax liability or refund involved in, the New York State\nincome tax return or claim for refund as a whole. (b) For purposes of applying the rule of\nclause (\na\n) of this subparagraph, where the schedule, entry or\nother portion of the New York State income tax return or claim for refund\ninvolves amounts of gross income, amounts of deductions, amounts of\nmodifications or amounts on the basis of which credits are determined, which\nare: (1)\nless than $2,000; or\n(2)\nless than $100,000, and also less than 20\npercent of the gross income (or New York adjusted gross income if the taxpayer\nis an individual) as shown on the New York State income tax return or claim for\nrefund, then the schedule or other portion is not considered to be a\nsubstantial portion. Where more than one schedule, entry or other portion is\ninvolved, they will be aggregated in applying the rule of this clause. Thus, where a person prepares a schedule which totals $1,500 for an individual\ntaxpayer's New York State income tax return and also gives advice making such\nperson a preparer of another schedule which totals $1,500, such person is not a\npreparer if the taxpayer's New York adjusted gross income shown on the New York\n\nState income tax return is more than $15,000. This clause shall not apply to a\nperson who prepares all of a New York State income tax return or claim for\nrefund. (c) A preparer\nof a New York State income tax return is not considered to be a preparer of\nanother New York State income tax return merely because an entry or entries\nreported on such New York State income tax return may affect an entry reported\non such other return, unless the preparer actually prepared a substantial\nportion of both returns. For example, if a substantial portion of an individual\npartner's New York State personal income tax return consists of an entry or\nentries derived from a New York State partnership return, a preparer of the New\n\nYork State partnership return shall not be considered the preparer of the\nindividual partner's New York State personal income tax return, unless the\npreparer of the New York State partnerships return actually prepares the\nindividual partner's New York State personal income tax return. (ii)\nA person who furnishes to a\ntaxpayer or other preparer sufficient information and advice so that completion\nof the New York State income tax return or claim for refund is largely a\nmechanical or clerical matter is considered an income tax return preparer, even\nthough such person does not actually place or review placement of information\non such return or such claim for refund. (iii)\nA person who only gives advice on\nspecific issues of law will not be considered an income tax return preparer, unless: (a) the advice is given with respect\nto events which have occurred at the time the advice is rendered and is not\ngiven with respect to the consequences of contemplated actions; (b) the advice is directly relevant to the\ndetermination of the existence, characterization or amount of an entry on the\n\nNew York State income tax return or claim for refund; and\n(c) the person has actual knowledge that the\ntaxpayer utilized the advice rendered on the New York State income tax return\nor claim for refund. (iv)\nA person must prepare a New York State\nincome tax return or claim for refund for compensation to be an income tax\nreturn preparer. A person who prepares a New York State income tax return or\nclaim for refund for a taxpayer with no explicit or implicit agreement for\ncompensation is not a preparer, even though such person receives a gift, a\nreturn of services or a favor. (v) A person who prepares a New York State income tax return or claim for refund\noutside the United States is an income tax return preparer, regardless of such\npreparer's nationality, residence, or the locations of such person's places of\nbusiness, if such person otherwise satisfies the definition of income tax\nreturn preparer. (vi)\n\nAn official\nor employee of the Internal Revenue Service or the New York State Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance performing such official's or employee's official duties\nis not an income tax return preparer. (vii)\n\nThe following are not income tax return\npreparers: (a) any individual who provides tax\nassistance under a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program established\nby the Internal Revenue Service or the New York State Department of Taxation\nand Finance; (b) any organization\nsponsoring or administering a Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program\nestablished by the Internal Revenue Service or the New York State Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance, but only with respect to that sponsorship or\nadministration; (c) any individual\nwho provides tax counseling for the elderly under a program established\npursuant to section 163 of the Federal Revenue Act of 1978; and\n(d) any organization sponsoring or\nadministering a program to provide tax counseling for the elderly established\npursuant to section 163 of the Federal Revenue Act of 1978, but only with\nrespect to that sponsorship or administration. (viii)\n\nPersons who are not income tax return\npreparers. A person will not be considered to be a preparer of a New York State\nincome tax return or claim for refund where such person performs only one or\nmore of the following services: (a) typing, reproduction, or other mechanical assistance in the preparation of a New York\n\nState income tax return or claim for refund; (b) preparation of a New York State income\ntax return or claim for refund of a person or general partner, by whom the\nindividual is regularly and continuously employed or in which such individual\nis a general partner; or\n(c) preparation of a New York State personal income tax return or claim for refund\nfor any person by a fiduciary if such fiduciary is preparing such return or\nsuch claim for refund in such fiduciary's capacity as a fiduciary of such\nperson. (2)\n\nPerson defined. For purposes of this section, the term\nperson\nincludes an individual, a corporation (including a\ndissolved corporation) or a partnership. (3)\n\nNew York State income tax return defined. For purposes of this section, the term\n\nNew York\n\nState income tax return\nmeans any return required under article 22 of\nthe Tax Law. (4)\n\nClaim for\nrefund defined. For purposes of this section, the term\nclaim\nfor refund\nmeans a claim for refund of or credit against any New York\n\nState tax imposed under article 22 of the Tax Law, and includes any claim for\nrefund of any credit treated as an overpayment of New York State tax under\narticle 22 of the Tax Law. (5)\n\nRetention period defined. For purposes of this section, the term\nretention period\nmeans: (i) in the case of a New York State income\ntax return, the period ending the later of three years after the due date of\nsuch New York State income tax return (without regard to extensions of time to\nfile), or three years after the date such New York State income tax return was\npresented to the taxpayer for such taxpayer's signature; and\n(ii)\nin the case of a claim for refund, the\nperiod ending three years after such claim for refund was presented to the\ntaxpayer for such taxpayer's signature. (e) Any person who fails to comply with the\nprovisions of section\n658 (g)\nof the Tax Law and\nthis section may be liable for the civil penalties provided for by sections\n685 (i)\nand\n685 (u)\nof the Tax Law, and the criminal penalty provided for by\nsection\n1801 (a)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (f) The provisions of section\n658 (g)\nof the Tax Law and\nthis section in no way affect the taxpayer's obligation to sign and certify\nsuch taxpayer's New York State income tax return or claim for refund (see\nsection\n653\nof the Tax Law and Part 153 of this\n\nTitle).
