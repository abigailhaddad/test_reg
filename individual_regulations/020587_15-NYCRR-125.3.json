  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 125.3 - Delay of suspension and revocation\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf an administrative law judge suspends or revokes a\nmotorist's license or registration as part of the penalty imposed for a\nviolation, the start of the period of suspension or revocation will be delayed\nfor 30 days unless the administrative law judge determines that a substantial\ntraffic safety hazard would result from the delay. The motorist may waive the\n30-day delay, in which case the suspension or revocation will take effect at\n12:01 a.m. the following day. If the motorist does not surrender his or her\nlicense or number plates by the effective date of the suspension or revocation, the order will be in effect, but credit for the suspension or revocation period\nshall be computed only from the date of surrender. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n125.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
