  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 712.3 - Procedure\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn view of the above considerations, the department specifies\nthe following procedures for the evaluation and approval or disapproval of\nliterature for inmates. (a) Establishment of Facility Media Review Committee (FMRC). (1)\n\nEach institution will establish a media\nreview committee and designate a Facility Media Review Committee Chairperson, who will be responsible for the oversight of the day to day operations of the\nFMRC. It is suggested that this committee consist of representatives from\nprogram services (for example, representatives from the guidance unit, mental\nhealth staff, chaplains' office, education staff, recreation staff, and library\nstaff) and representatives from security staff. All FMRC activities will be\nreported monthly to the Central Office Media Review Committee\n(COMRC). (2)\n\nThe superintendent\nwill inform the deputy commissioner for program services or his or her designee\nof the membership of the Facility Media Review Committee. The superintendent\nwill also inform the deputy commissioner for program services or his or her\ndesignee of any changes in said membership. (b) Referral of publications to FMRC, notice to inmate. (1)\n\nPublications\nproperly received at the facility for an inmate in mail or packages shall be\ndelivered to the inmate in the ordinary course of mail or package delivery\nunless referred to the FMRC upon a reasonable good faith belief that the\npublication violates one or more of the media review guidelines listed in\nsection\n712.2\nof this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nWhen there is a good\nfaith belief that a publication already belonging to or in possession of an\ninmate violates one or more of the media review guidelines, said publication\nshall be confiscated and referred to the FMRC for review and\ndecision. (3)\n\nPublications referred\nto the FMRC shall be delivered promptly to the FMRC. Notice to the inmate is\nmade by using Exhibit A (see subdivision [j] of this section) which must be\nplaced in the institutional mail at the same time as the publication is\nreferred, unless doing so would interfere with an ongoing\ninvestigation. (c) Facility Media Review Committee operations. (1)\n\nThe FMRC shall meet at least once weekly\nunless there are no publications for review. (2)\nA decision regarding a publication shall\nbe rendered by the FMRC within 10 working days of the publication's receipt at\nthe facility. In the event that an FMRC does not respond to the inmate within\n10 working days, the lack of a response shall constitute a constructive denial\nby the FMRC, and the inmate can appeal such denial, in writing, to the\nCOMRC. (3)\n\nShould the FMRC approve\na publication, said publication shall be forwarded promptly to the\ninmate. (4)\n\nShould the FMRC\ndisapprove a publication, such decision shall be set forth in Exhibit B (see\nsubdivision [k] of this section) and include a brief statement of reasons\nexplaining why the publication is deemed to violate one or more of the media\nreview guidelines and identifying by page number, article title, and location\non the page, the contents objected to. (The FMRC shall not state that a\npublication is unacceptable in its entirety.) An example concerning such brief\nstatement of reasons is set forth below: (i) The following is an acceptable statement of reasons: \"This publication incites\ninmates to commit assaults on correctional officers in the article 'Prison\n\nRebellion Now' on page 10, near the bottom.\"\n(ii)\n\nThe following is not an acceptable\nstatement of reasons: \"This publication incites disobedience towards law\nenforcement personnel on page 10.\"\n(5)\n\nNotice to Inmate. When the FMRC\ndisapproves a publication or any portion thereof, a copy of Exhibit B (see\nsubdivision [k] of this section) shall be sent promptly to the inmate, unless\ndoing so would interfere with an ongoing investigation. (6)\n\nNotice to sender. When the FMRC disapproves a publication, or any portion\nthereof, a copy of the Inmate Disposition Notice, Exhibit B, together with a\ncopy of form #4572C, Sender Disapproval Notice, Exhibit C, notifying the sender\nof the right to appeal, shall be sent to the sender at the same time that the\n\nInmate Disposition Notice is sent to the inmate, unless doing so would\ninterfere with an ongoing investigation. No notice to the sender is required if\nthe FMRC previously provided notice to the same sender of an identical FMRC\ndecision regarding the same publication, notwithstanding that the intended\ninmate recipient is not the same. For purposes of this regulation, the term\nsender\nshall refer to the person or entity that sent the\ninmate the publication, if known, or if that person or entity is unknown, then\nthe publisher, if known. (d) Inmate options regarding appeal or\nother disposition when notified that a publication has been disapproved by\n\nFacility Media Review Committee. When the FMRC disapproves a publication, the inmate shall be\npermitted to select one of the following options (see Exhibit B, subdivision\n[k] of this section): (1)\n\nAppeal to\nCOMRC. The inmate shall not be entitled to appeal unless he chooses\nthis option within 30 days of the FMRC decision. (2)\n\nReceive the publication with the\nobjectionable matter removed or blotted out. This option shall be available only if the objectionable\nportions of the publication constitute eight or fewer individual pages or if\nthey constitute a single chapter, article or section of any length. This option\nneed not be made available if the publication is in a form other then a book, magazine, or newspaper, and if removing or blotting out portions would present\nphysical difficulties. The choice between blotting out or removing\nobjectionable material is made at the discretion of the\nfacility. (3)\n\nHave the\npublication sent, at the inmate's expense, to a person of the inmate's choice, not another inmate or a Department of Corrections and Community Supervision\nofficial, either immediately or after 30 days. (4)\n\nHave the publication destroyed after 30\ndays. If the inmate does not make a choice among these options\nwithin 30 days of the FMRC decision, the facility may dispose of the\npublication in any manner. Note: If the inmate chooses not to appeal, the publication will be\nheld, as is, for at least 30 days from the date of the Inmate Disposition\n\nNotice to allow time for the sender to submit an appeal, if any. If the sender\nsubmits an appeal, the publication will be held, as is, pending the COMRC\ndetermination. If neither the inmate nor the sender submits a timely appeal\nand the inmate has not made a choice among disposal options, disposal of the\nmaterial(s) will be at the discretion of the superintendent or his or her\ndesignee. (e) Appeals to Central Office Media Review Committee. When an inmate elects to appeal the FMRC's disapproval of a\npublication, the inmate shall check the appropriate box on the disposition\nnotice, Exhibit B (see subdivision [k] of this section). The inmate may also, at his or her option, include an appeal letter. When the sender elects to appeal the FMRC's disapproval of a\npublication, the sender shall provide a written statement in support of the\nappeal, a copy of the inmate disposition notice (Exhibit B), and, if available, a copy of the issue of the publication found to be unacceptable. An appeal by the inmate or sender must be submitted to the\nFMRC within 30 days of the date of the inmate disposition notice. After 30 days\nfrom the date of the inmate disposition notice, the FMRC shall forward any\nappeal received from the inmate and/or sender along with the Inmate Disposition\n\nNotice and the publication in question to the COMRC. Appeals shall be forwarded\nat facility expense by first class mail or equally prompt\nmeans. (f) Establishment of Central Office Media Review Committee (COMRC). The Central Office Media Review Committee (COMRC) will\nconsist of representatives of program services, security services, counsel's\noffice and administrative services. The committee will be chaired by the deputy\ncommissioner for program services or his designee. (g) Central Office Media Review\n\nCommittee (COMRC) Operations. (1)\n\nThe\nCOMRC shall meet at least bi-weekly unless there are no publications awaiting\nreview. (2)\n\nAll publications\nappealed to the COMRC will be reviewed and a decision rendered thereon within\nthree weeks of the date the appeal was received by the COMRC. (3)\nTHE COMRC in deciding whether to approve\nor disapprove a publication shall consider any statements submitted in a timely\nmanner. (4)\n\nIf the inmate has\nappealed, he or she shall receive the inmate appeal determination (see\nsubdivision (m) of this section, Exhibit D), which will set forth the COMRC\nappeal determination along with the reason for the determination. If both the\nsender and the inmate have appealed the FMRC determination, the sender will be\nnotified by attaching a copy of Exhibit D to the sender appeal determination\n(see subdivision (n) of this section, Exhibit E). If only the sender has\nappealed, then the COMRC will notify the sender of its determination via\n\nExhibit E, and set forth the reason for the determination on the form. The\nCOMRC will notify the FMRC chairperson, in addition to the inmate and/or\nsender. The COMRC shall return its appeal determination (Exhibit D, E or both)\nand the publication in question to the FMRC chairperson. The inmate will\nreceive a copy of the inmate appeal determination (Exhibit D) only. Note: In cases where the COMRC has approved a publication the FMRC\nshall return material directly to the inmate. (5)\n\nWhen the COMRC disapproves a publication, the inmate shall have the following options: (i) Receive the publication with the\nobjectionable portions blotted or cut out. This option is available only if the\nobjectionable portion is eight pages or less, or a single chapter, article, or\nsection of any length. (ii)\n\nHave\nthe publication sent, at the inmate's expense, to a person of the inmate's\nchoice, not another inmate or a Department of Corrections and Community\n\nSupervision official, either immediately or after 30 days. (iii)\n\nHave the publication\ndestroyed. (iv)\n\nHave the\npublication retained at the facility for 30 days while the inmate makes\narrangements for its disposition, including being picked up by a visitor during\nthe period.

(h) List of approved publications approved by the Central Office Media Review\n\nCommittee.

SENDER DISPOSITION NOTICE - GUIDELINES\nThe Department adopts the following guidelines by which\nliterature for inmates will be evaluated. A. In general, the materials must be\nacceptable for regular mailing according to United States Postal Law and\nregulations. B. Publications which\ncontain child pornography or which promote a sexual performance of a child in\nviolation of Penal Law article 263 are unacceptable. Publications in which\nmodels of any age are depicted or portrayed as underage persons in sexually\nprovocative poses or engaged in sexual activity are unacceptable. Publications\ndepicting nude children in a non-pornographic context, but which would promote\nor encourage prurient interest in the sexual performance of children, are\nunacceptable. Publications which, taken as a whole, by the average person\napplying contemporary community standards, appeal to prurient interest, and\nwhich depict or describe in a patently offensive way sexual bestiality, sadism, masochism, necrophilia or incest, and which taken as a whole, lack serious\nliterary, artistic, political or scientific value are obscene and are\nunacceptable. C. The publication\nshould not incite violence based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, or nationality. Incite violence, for purposes of this\nguideline, means to advocate, expressly or by clear implication, acts of\nviolence. D. Any publication which\nadvocates and presents a clear and immediate risk of lawlessness, violence, anarchy, or rebellion against governmental authority is unacceptable. E. The publication should not incite\ndisobedience towards law enforcement officers or prison personnel. Incite disobedience, for purposes of this guideline, means to\nadvocate, expressly or by clear implication, acts of disobedience. F. The publication should not give\ninstruction in the use or manufacture of firearms, explosives, and other\nweapons, or depict or describe their manufacture. Mere depictions of the use of\nhunting and/or military weapons which reasonably would not affect the safety\nand/or security of the facility are not prohibited. G. The publication should not provide\ninstruction by word(s) or picture(s) regarding martial arts skills. Martial\narts include, but are not limited to, aikido, jujitsu, judo, karate, kung fu, and tai chi chu'an. Publications which discuss martial arts without providing\ninstruction are acceptable. H. The\npublication should not: 1. Contain information\nwhich appears to be written in code; or\n2. Depict or describe methods of lock\npicking; or\n3. Depict or describe\nmethods of escape from correctional facilities or contain maps which could aid\nan inmate in an escape from a correctional facility (i.e. immediate area of the\nfacility, detailed road maps, etc.); or\n4. Depict or describe procedures for the\nbrewing of alcoholic beverages or the manufacture of drugs or use of illegal\ndrugs; or\n5. Depict or describe\nmethods or procedures for smuggling prison contraband; or\n6. Depict or describe techniques or methods\nfor rioting and/or information instructive in hostage or riot negotiation\ntechniques. 7. Depict or describe\nhand signs, insignias, graffiti, or any other identifiers depicting or\npertaining to a gang, or text that describes or depicts gang or other\nunauthorized group activity in such a way that it would promote or instruct in\nthe formation of such groups inside a correctional facility. The Department reserves the right to deny the inmate\npublications which may be held non-inciteful or non-advocative, as the case may\nbe, during the Media Review Process, but which actually result in violence or\ndisobedience after entrance into a facility, as is clearly set forth in\nguidelines 3 and 6 above. Such items shall be referred to the Facility Media\n\nReview Committee (FMRC), and if appealed, referred to the Central Office Media\n\nReview Committee (COMRC), for decision. Publications which discuss different political philosophies\nand those dealing with criticism of Governmental and Departmental authority are\nacceptable as reading material provided they do not violate the above\nguidelines. For Example, publications such as Fortune News, The Militant, The\n\nTorch/La Antorcha, Workers World, and Revolutionary Worker shall generally be\napproved unless matter in a specific issue is found to violate the above\nguidelines. The purposes of the foregoing guidelines are to facilitate\naccess by inmates to a wide range of literature. Superintendents and staff of correctional facilities are\nurged to use whatever means they have available to provide facility libraries\nwith literature which presents differing points of view relevant to the issues\nof the day.
