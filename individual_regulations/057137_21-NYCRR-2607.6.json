The beginning\nfarmer may apply (on forms approved by the corporation) for a beginning farmer\nloan with any lender. Any loan approved will be assigned to that lender. Eligibility for a beginning farmer loan is determined by the requirements of\nthe act and the rules of the corporation. All terms and conditions of a loan\nmust be agreed upon between the beginning farmer and the lender, which terms\nand conditions may not be any more onerous than those charged to similar\ncustomers for similar loans, but taking into account the tax-exempt nature of\ninterest on the loan. Following completion of the application by the beginning\nfarmer and approval by the lender, the application must be submitted to the\ncorporation for review and approval by the corporation. The review will\ninclude, but not be limited to, whether: (1)\nthe loan applicant is a qualified beginning farmer; (2)\nthe loan proceeds will be used for a\nqualified purpose by a beginning farmer under the act, rules of the\ncorporation, and the United States Internal Revenue Code and Internal Revenue\n\nService regulations relating to private activity bonds; (3)\nthe terms of the loan comply with these\nrules; (4)\nthe bond purchaser meets\nthe definition of a lender or bond purchaser; and\n(5)\nthe lender or bond purchaser has\nadequately taken into account the tax-exempt nature of interest on the loan. If the corporation, in consultation with the department, determines that any of the foregoing conditions have not been satisfied, it may\ndeny the application. As part of its review, the corporation may require the\nbeginning farmer to submit appraisals on part or all of the property being\nfinanced by the loan or to submit any or all other documents and information as\nmay be necessary to complete its review of the loan application. (b) Following approval\nof the loan and issuance of the bond, the corporation will enter into a loan\nagreement or financing agreement with the beginning farmer and then assign the\nnon-recourse loan to the lender. The corporation may charge fees as necessary\nto defray its costs for processing the loan and bond. Issuance of bond. Following approval of the loan by the corporation, and upon obtaining all\nnecessary approvals, the corporation will issue a bond, to be purchased by the\nlender or bond purchaser, in the same amount and consistent with the repayment\nterms of the loan to the beginning farmer. The principal and interest on the\nbond is a limited obligation payable solely out of the revenues derived from\nthe loan or finance agreement, debt obligation or sales contract with the\nbeginning farmer and the underlying collateral or other security furnished by\nor on behalf of the beginning farmer. The lender or bond purchaser shall have\nno other recourse against the corporation. The principal and interest on the\nbond does not constitute an indebtedness of the corporation or the State of New\n\nYork or a charge against its general credit or general fund. (c) Priority of applications. Applications\nshall be processed by the corporation on a first-come, first-served basis, based upon the receipt of a completed application as so determined in the sole\ndiscretion of the corporation. (d) Procedures following bond issuance. No bond proceeds may be used for a\nnonqualified purpose or by a nonqualified user. Following disbursement of the\nbond proceeds, the lender and beginning farmer may be required to certify to\nthe corporation that the proceeds were used by the qualified beginning farmer\nfor a qualified purpose. (e) Assignment of loans by lenders or bond purchasers. A lender or bond purchaser\nmay assign a loan in whole or in part to any person as defined in PAL section\n1281. Servicing of the loan may also be assigned, but must at all times be with\na lender or bond purchaser as defined herein. The corporation must be notified\nin writing prior to any assignment of the loan. (f) Assumption of loans, substitution of\ncollateral and transfer of property. Loans may not be assumed without the prior\nwritten approval of the corporation, and then only if the purchaser of the\nproperty is an eligible applicant for a NYBFLP loan. Equipment and other\ndepreciable property may be exchanged or traded for similar property, and other\nproperty such as breeding livestock may be added or substituted as collateral\nat the discretion of the lender or bond purchaser without the prior approval of\nthe corporation. The benefits of the loan made at the tax-exempt rate from the\nproceeds of a corporation bond must remain with a qualified beginning farmer, and no person to whom property is traded or otherwise transferred may obtain\nthe benefits of the corporation loan. (g) Right to audit. The corporation, in\nconsultation with the department, shall have at any time the right to audit the\nrecords of the lender or bond purchaser and the beginning farmer relating to\nany loan and bond hereunder.
