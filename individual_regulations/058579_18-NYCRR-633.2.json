Tit. 18 § 633.2 - Conditions for reimbursement for services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No portion of any claim for reimbursement\nfor services may be supported solely by State funds if reimbursement may be\nclaimed from programs for which there is Federal participation. (b) Any claims for reimbursement related to a\nportion of an activity or program for which Federal participation is available\nwhich were not fully reimbursed as claimed and which were properly made at the\ntime they were originally claimed may be claimed as expenses for which Federal\nparticipation is available pursuant to title XX of the Federal Social Security\n\nAct or for other expenditures for which Federal participation is available if\nsuch claims were appropriate when originally submitted. This subdivision shall\napply only when the revised claim is timely and not in excess of any ceiling or\nlimitation for Federal participation and an adjustment to reduce the original\nclaim is simultaneously submitted to the department. (c) Any claims for reimbursement for services\nfor which there is Federal participation but which were not reimbursed and\nwhich were properly made, may be claimed as if Federal participation is not\navailable pursuant to this Part, if Federal participation is unavailable and if\nsuch claims could have been submitted pursuant to this Part at the time they\nwere originally claimed, provided that the revised claim is timely and an\nadjustment is simultaneously submitted to the department to reduce the original\nclaim. (d) Claims for reimbursement\nauthorized pursuant to this Part shall not be submitted if such claims seek\nreimbursement at rates or amounts which are greater than otherwise permitted by\nthe department. (e) Any claims for\nreimbursement submitted pursuant to this Part which are subsequently determined\nby the department to be reimbursable from, or for which a higher proportion of\n\nFederal participation could be received from, another program or activity shall\nbe reduced by an amount equivalent to the amount determined by the department\nto be due from such program or activity. (f) Any adjustment of claims for\nreimbursement, including adjustments to claims as a result of recoveries or\ncollections, shall be made in accordance with procedures, instructions or\ndirections of the department.
