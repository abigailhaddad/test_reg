  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 125.5 - General design requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe design requirements set forth in this section are\nintended to provide maximum safety and convenience for the travelling public\nand the permittee and are based on the premise that the rights of highway users\nand those of abutting property owners can mutually be satisfied. The department\nreserves the right to impose additional requirements should they be necessary\nfor public safety. (a) A driveway or a\ndriveway system shall be so located as to provide: (1)\nthe most favorable vision, grade and\nalignment conditions for motorists using the proposed driveway and the\nhighway; (2)\nno undue interference\nwith the free and safe movement of highway traffic; (3)\nmaximum safety and convenience for\npedestrians and other users of highway right-of-way. (b) In and of the interests of public safety\nand convenience, the department may restrict the placement of a driveway to a\nparticular location along the owner's frontage or require shifting of an\nexisting driveway. (c) In general, permits will not be issued for entrances to State highways along acceleration\nor deceleration lanes, and lane tapers. The department's policy on access\ncontrol also prohibits construction of a driveway within 300 feet (100 feet in\nurban areas) of an expressway ramp. To enforce this policy of controlling\naccess in areas of increased vehicular conflict, the department has the option\nof purchasing the owner's right of access to a public highway. (d) The following design features helpful in\nlaying out all driveways are illustrated in section\n125.13: The point where the extension of the driveway edge\nintersects the pavement edge. The point where the driveway corner radius intersects with\nthe pavement edge. The point where the driveway corner radius becomes tangent\nto the driveway edge. The center of the driveway corner radius are driveway\ncorner radius. Driveway corner radius. A corner angle, the angle the driveway edge makes with the\npavement edge. The width of a driveway pavement. The distance between points A and B. The distance between points A and C. (e) The location and geometric alignment of\ndriveways adjacent to intersections will be governed by the angle of\nintersecting highways, width of private and public rights-of-way, sight\ndistance factors, highway and driveway radius traffic control and other\nconditions. Normally, the distance between point A of a driveway and the side\nroad pavement edge, as measured along the highway pavement edge, shall be at\nleast twice the width of the driveway plus 15 feet (see sections\n125.13, figure 1A and 125.14). However, the department may modify this distance if an engineering\ndetermination indicates another dimension is more suitable for a particular\nsite. A driveway radius should not encroach on the radius of the intersecting\nhighway pavement. A driveway should be located entirely within the applicant's\nfrontage. (f) The minimum distance\nbetween point B of any driveway or driveway system and the point where a\nprojection perpendicular to the center line of the roadway from the near\nproperty corner meets the highway pavement edge is to be five feet, measured\nalong the highway pavement edge (see sections\n125.13, figures A and 125.14). In\nrestricted urban areas and for jointly-owned driveways variances may be\npermitted. (g) Normally, only one\ndriveway shall be permitted for each residential property. An additional\ndriveway may be permitted if both sufficient frontage exists and extenuating\ncircumstances justify one. The minimum distance between adjacent Points B of\ntwo driveways to the same residential property as measured along the highway\npavement edge shall be 30 feet (see sections\n125.13\nfigure 1A and\n125.14). (h) Normally, no more than\none driveway shall be allowed to a property in the minor commercial or\nsubdivision category. Where the need for more than one can be substantiated\noperationally, and adequate frontage exists, the department may grant\npermission for an additional driveway. The minimum distance between adjacent\n\nPoints B of adjacent driveways or driveway systems to a commercial property, as\nmeasured along the highway pavement edge, shall be 75 feet (see sections\n125.13, figure 1A and\n125.14). (i) In a dual commercial\ndriveway system the minimum distance between Points B of the driveway pavements\nas measured along the highway pavement edge, shall be 30 feet (see sections\n125.13, figure 1A; 125.14 and\n125.16). (j) Inadequate sight\ndistance or other safety or operational deficiencies may require that turn\nrestrictions be imposed at the driveway. Desirable sight distances at driveways\nare shown in sections 125.22 and\n125.23. These sight distances are\ndesigned to enable vehicles exiting from the driveway to turn left or right and\nto accelerate to the operating speed of the highway without causing vehicles on\nthe highway to reduce their speed by more than 10 miles per hour. Vehicles\nexiting to the left should be able to clear the near half of the highway\nwithout conflicting with through traffic approaching from the left. These sight\ndistances are based on a 42\" eye height and a 54\" object height. Sight\ndistances for semi-trailers are based on a 72\" eye height and a 54\" object\nheight. Use of turn restrictions and/or acceleration lanes can eliminate the\nneed for sight distances shown in sections 125.22 and\n125.23. If the Regional Traffic\n\nEngineer believes that through traffic would accept a 20 mile per hour\nreduction in speed due to driveway use, the values may be reduced by\none-third. (k) No driveway shall be\nlocated where the sight distance along the highway is less than a safe stopping\nsight distance. If the driveway cannot be located where the available sight\ndistance exceeds the safe stopping sight distance, limiting access to right\nturns in and out of the driveway, and the provision of acceleration and/or\ndeceleration lanes should be considered. (l) On divided highways separated by a\nmedian, ditch, or median barrier, no median openings should be provided for\nleft turns to and from residential or commercial driveways. Existing median\nopenings may be closed by the department if it best serves the safety and\noperation of the State highway. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
