  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 6.8 - Annual review of driving record\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The provisions of this section do not\nrequire termination of employment as a bus driver based upon any single\nincident or series of incidents (other than convictions which require\ndisqualification as set forth in sections 6.27 and\n6.28\nof this Part), but rather\npermit the motor carrier to apply reasonable standards in making a\ndetermination based upon the entire driving record. Except as required by\nsections 6.27 and\n6.28\nof this Part, any termination\nof employment based on the provisions of this section is, therefore, the\ndetermination of the motor carrier using its independent judgment. Each motor\ncarrier shall: (1)\nat least once every 12\nmonths, require each bus driver it employs to prepare and furnish the carrier\nwith a list of all violations and accidents as defined in section\n6.2\nof this Part, of motor vehicle\ntraffic laws and ordinances (other than violations involving only parking) of\nwhich the driver has been convicted or of which he or she has forfeited bond or\ncollateral during the preceding 12 months whether such violations or accidents\noccurred in this State or elsewhere. Such information shall be recorded in the\nemployee's record as presented on the annual review of employees driving record\nform (DS-872); (2)\nif a bus driver\nis a resident of, or is licensed by, a state other than New York, the motor\ncarrier must also obtain an abstract of operating record from the appropriate\nagency in the bus driver's state of residence. For these drivers, the motor\ncarrier is required to maintain the record in the driver's file; and\n(3)\nat least once every 12 months, review the\ndriving record of each driver it employs to determine whether that each driver\nmeets minimum requirements for safe driving and is qualified to drive a bus\npursuant to sections 6.3 and\n6.4\nof this Part. Such review\nshall include the information supplied under paragraph (1) of this subdivision\nand the information supplied by the mandatory notification program pursuant to\nsection\n6.17\nof this Part. Such review\nshall determine whether the bus driver has a currently valid driver's license\nor learner's permit in the class and with the proper endorsements appropriate\nto the type of vehicle the driver operates in the course of his or her\nemployment. In reviewing a driving record, the motor carrier or school district\nmust consider any evidence that the bus driver has violated applicable\nprovisions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. The motor carrier must also consider\nthe driver's accident record and any evidence that the driver has violated laws\ngoverning the operating of motor vehicles, such as speeding, reckless driving, and operating while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, that indicate that\nthe driver has exhibited a disregard for the safety of the public. (b) Annual personal\ninterview. A motor carrier shall conduct an annual review of the\ndriver's operating record, and a personal interview. The personal interview\nshall consist of questions to ascertain whether or not the information the\nmotor carrier has on file for the driver is accurate, and that the employee has\nbeen instructed in, and is in compliance with, the provisions of article 19-A. As part of such annual interview, the motor carrier shall instruct the driver\nabout the provisions of section\n6.15\n(d) of this\n\nPart which relate to the accumulation of three accidents within an 18 month\nperiod. The carrier shall instruct the driver about the potential driver's\nlicense sanctions and disqualification provisions as set forth in section\n6.15\nof this Part. The carrier\nshall also inform the driver about the motor vehicle accident prevention course\nprovided for in section\n6.15\n(d)(3)\nof\nthis Part. Copies of all abstracts should be attached to the annual review of\nemployees driving record. Compliance with this section shall be shown by\ncompleting the annual review of employees driving record from (DS-872) and\nmaintain the form in the driver's file. (c) Defensive driving\nperformance-regular observation. Regular observation of a driver's defensive driving\nperformance while operating the bus with passengers shall be made by\nindividuals certified by DMV (see section\n6.13\nof this Part). If an employee\ndoes not demonstrate satisfactory defensive driving techniques, the law does\nnot require that the driver be disqualified. However, the motor carrier shall\nnote on the annual defensive driving review form (DS-873) what the specific\ndeficiency was and what corrective measures (\ni.e., retraining, retesting, additional defensive driving performance reviews) were taken to\nbring the driver's performance up to satisfactory standards. NOTE: The regular observation of a driver's defensive driving\nperformance must be conducted at least once within every 12-month period and\nmay not be combined with, nor conducted on the same day as, the biennial behind\nthe wheel road test. (d) Each motor carrier shall annually prepare a report setting forth: (1)\nthe number of miles travelled by buses\noperated by such motor carrier in the preceding 12 months; (2)\nthe number of convictions and accidents\ninvolving any driver employed by such motor carrier during the preceding 12\nmonths, as reported to such carrier pursuant to this section; and\n(3)\nthe number of convictions and accidents\nper 10,000 miles travelled. Such report shall be filed with the department as\nan attachment to the affidavit of compliance required by section\n6.9\nof this Part, and a copy of\nsuch report shall be made available by the carrier to any person upon\nrequest.
