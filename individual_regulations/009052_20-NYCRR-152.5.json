  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 152.5 - Filing of New York State income tax return before due date\n\nState Regulations\nA New York State income tax return may be filed at any\ntime prior to the date such return is required to be filed under this\n\nSubchapter. If a New York State income tax return is filed prior to the\nexpiration of the taxable period, it must disclose the correct amount of income\nand deduction to the extent known to the taxpayer at the time such return is\nfiled, and an estimate as nearly correct as possible of those items of income\nwhich cannot be definitely ascertained at the time such return is made. If it\nlater appears that any item of income or deduction was not accurately reported, an amended New York State income tax return must be filed on or before the\nfinal due date of such return. With regard to the income tax due on an amended\n\nNew York State income tax return, see section\n152.15\nof this Part. Until the due date of a New York State income tax return, it is\nconsidered a tentative New York State income tax return which will then become\na final New York State income tax return, unless an amended New York State\nincome tax return is filed on or prior to such due date. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n152.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
