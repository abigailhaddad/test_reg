  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-3.1 - Registration of investments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Securities are issued either registered in the name of the owner or in bearer\nform. The registration of investments in the name of the local agency is a\nprime consideration in their safekeeping and no investments in bearer\nsecurities should be made without the prior approval of the division and only\nafter adequate safeguards have been provided for the handling and safekeeping\nof the securities, as described in sections\n1645-3.2\nand\n1645-3.3\nbelow. The form in which\nthe investment is registered should include the name of the local agency, the\nname and number of the project and the name of the fund whose cash is being\ninvested, as per the following example: \"Yorkburgh Housing Authority, a public corporation, in\ntrust for the purposes of the Sunshine Courts, Project NYS-999 Reserve Fund, under Section ________________ of the contract dated _______________ with the\n\nCity of Yorkburgh, State of New York.\"\n(b) No indication need be made in the name in\nwhich reserve funds are registered as to the particular reserve for which the\ninvestment is being made, in order to facilitate the transfer of investments, which may be made, under certain circumstances, among the various reserves (see\n§\n1645-4.2\n). The investment ledger\nsheet should, however, be marked to indicate the applicable reserve. Registered\nsecurities should be kept in a safe deposit box. (c) Savings accounts in savings banks and\nsavings and loan associations shall be registered as follows: \"Yorkburgh Housing Authority, Sunshine Courts, Reserve\n\nFund, in trust under New York State Loan and Subsidy Contract, NYS--999.\"\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1645-3.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
