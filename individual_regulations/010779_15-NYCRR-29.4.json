To\nimplement the collection of this tax, the following administrative procedures\nwill be used: (1)\n\nThe tax will not apply to\nregistrations which are exempt from registration fees nor to nonprofit\nreligious, charitable or educational organizations qualified for exemption with\nthe New York State Department of Taxation and Finance or to a vehicle used only\nin connection with the operation of a farm by the owner or tenant of the\nfarm. (2)\n\nThe tax will be paid for\nall registrations and renewals of registrations for which the registration fee\nis established in section\n401 (6)(a) or\n(7)\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law. (3)\nA registration transaction will be\nrejected when the proper fee is not presented, or when the registrant indicates\nthat the tax does not apply to him/her but refuses to sign an exemption\ncertificate. (b) Original applications. (1)\n\nThe appropriate\ntax will be based upon the county of residence stated on an original\napplication for registration. (2)\n\nIn order for an exemption from the collection of the tax to be granted, an\nexemption certificate (UT-11C) will be required to be submitted for those\ntransactions for which the tax would ordinarily be due. (c) Renewals. (1)\n\nRegistration records will be examined for\ncounty of residence addresses for renewals of registrations for vehicles\nsubject to the tax. Such renewal applications will be printed to show the\ncounty use tax as \"2 Year Use Tax\" and as part of the \"Amount Due\" on the\nregistration renewal application. (2)\n\nRegistrants against whom the tax is\nassessed and who indicate that it does not apply to them, will be required to\ncomplete a tax exemption certificate (UT-11C). (3)\n\nIf the registrant indicates that s/he is\nrequired to pay the tax but the amount was not preprinted, the issuing office\nwill amend the registration record to correct the county field and the tax will\nbe charged. (d) Refunds\nfor certain unused registrations. When any annual fee paid for the registration\nof a motor vehicle is refunded by DMV in accordance with section\n428\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law, the amount of any county use tax paid upon such\nregistration shall also be refunded by the commissioner.
