  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 370.2 - Determination of initial eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n\nSafety net assistance includes assistance granted to\nveterans under existing laws, and assistance to persons not residing in their\nown homes when such persons reside in other living situations for which a\nsafety net assistance grant may be provided as specified in Part 352 of this\n\nSubchapter. Safety net assistance does not include medical assistance, foster\ncare of children, or care classifiable under the law as public institutional\ncare. (a) Investigation. When\npracticable, responsibility must be placed upon the applicant for safety net\nassistance to provide verified information concerning his or her previous\nmaintenance, loss of income and the extent and duration of current need. Both\nthe method and content of investigation must be aimed at assisting the\napplicant to return to self-support and fully utilize resources related\nthereto. (b) Financial\nrequirements. The initial determination must include consideration of each of\nthe following eligibility factors: (1)\n\nPrevious maintenance and reason for application. For each member of the\nhousehold applying for assistance, the following must be determined: the source\nand amount of previous income or maintenance; the reason and date of its\ndiscontinuance; presumptive eligibility for benefits relating to loss of\nincome; and employability and availability for employment. (2)\n\nPresumptive duration of need. On the\nbasis of all available facts, an evaluation must be made of the following: the\nprobable duration of need based upon consideration of the applicant's\nemployability and the availability of employment in the current labor market; his or her presumptive eligibility for work-related benefits; and the\navailability of vocational training, rehabilitation services, and the\navailability or potential availability of other resources that will make his or\nher need for financial assistance short-term. (3)\n\nAbility of relatives to support. (i) For both short-term and long-term cases, the social services official must determine the existence and whereabouts of\nthe legally responsible relatives of persons for whom application is made and\nof the ability of such relatives to support. When legally responsible relatives\nare able to provide support to the applicant and are not doing so, the social\nservices official must implement procedures to enforce support. (ii)\n\nIn considering the ability of a legally\nresponsible relative to support, the offer of a home must be carefully explored\nand evaluated. The evaluation must include a determination of the reason for\nthe separation which had occurred, and if children, minors or other persons are\nmembers of the applicant's family unit, the advisability of a change in their\nliving arrangements. (iii)\n\nSuch an\noffer of a home does not preclude consideration of eligibility for safety net\nassistance. If the social services official determines that the legally\nresponsible relative is otherwise able but unwilling to contribute to the\nsupport of the applicant, the social services official must initiate\nappropriate action to enforce support. (iv)\n\nSocial services officials may evaluate\nthe willingness of socially responsible persons to assist in whole or in part\nin the support of applicants. Where socially responsible persons assisted in\nthe past, the situation must be reviewed to determine current availability of\nsuch support. (v) In considering\nthe ability of socially responsible persons to support, the offer of a home by\na person must be included in the exploration and evaluation of resources. In\nconsidering the offer of a home, there must be a careful evaluation of the\nsuitability of such resource in the individual situation, including the\nphysical and mental health of the applicant, his or her current living\narrangements, and his or her personal wishes and those of his family. (4)\n\nNot eligible for or receiving\nassistance as family assistance (FA). For each member of the household included\nin the safety net assistance application it must be determined that he or she\nis not eligible to receive FA. (5)\n\nPotential eligibility for SSI. (i) Each\napplicant for safety net assistance or his or her authorized representative\nmust sign a repayment of interim assistance authorization. (ii)\n\nSubject to the conditions set forth in\nthe interim assistance sections of this Part, each applicant for safety net\nassistance who, based on a medical statement documenting or indicating\nexistence of a physical or mental impairment, reasonably appears to qualify for\nSSI benefits, or who during the safety net assistance application process\ndemonstrates behavior or symptoms suggesting potential SSI eligibility, or who\nhas reached or will before the end of the following calendar month reach his or\nher 65th birthday or who otherwise appears to be eligible for SSI benefits must\nalso be required to apply for SSI benefits, cooperate with the SSI eligibility\ndetermination process, and appeal any denial of his or her initial SSI\napplication and exhaust the available administrative remedies. (iii)\n\nAny medical statement used in\nestablishing potential SSI eligibility along with any other medical\ndocumentation available must be attached by the social services district to the\nSSI Referral and Certification of Contact form when the applicant is referred\nto the Social Security Administration (SSA) to file for SSI benefits. (iv)\n\nEach social services district must\nestablish procedures for: (a) promptly\nidentifying and assessing those safety net assistance and FA applicants and\nrecipients who are potentially eligible for SSI; (b) providing medical and related information\nto persons referred to the SSA and assisting the client in obtaining such\ninformation if there has been no prior diagnosis or treatment; (c) establishing an SSI tracking system to\ndetermine whether safety net assistance and FA applicants or recipients who are\npotentially eligible for SSI have completed the Federal disability benefit\napplication and appeals processes; (d) providing assistance to safety net\nassistance and FA applicants and recipients in pursuing SSI benefits and, when\nnecessary, assisting such applicants and recipients in appealing the denial of\nsuch benefits; and\n(e) referring\nsafety net assistance and FA applicants and recipients to not- for-profit\nagencies and not-for-profit legal services corporations receiving grants under\nsection\n35\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law, if any. (6)\n\nTransfer of property. (i) A person is not eligible for safety net\nassistance who has made a voluntary assignment or transfer of real or personal\nproperty for the purpose of qualifying for such aid. A transfer of such\nproperty made within one year prior to the date of application is presumed to\nhave been made for the purpose of qualifying for such assistance. (ii)\n\nIf the agency determines that the\ntransfer was not made to qualify for safety net assistance, then such transfer\nor assignment will not constitute a basis for denial. (7)\n\nNo person receiving public institutional\ncare may receive safety net assistance. (c) Nonfinancial requirements. The following\nrequirements must be evaluated to establish initial eligibility: (1)\n\nAge. (i) The applicant must furnish the date of\nbirth for each person applying for assistance.
