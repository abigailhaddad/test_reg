(b) Motor vehicle storage\nfacilities in a multiple dwelling or in a structure upon the premises thereof\nshall be separated from the multiple dwelling by distance, or by fire-resistive\nmaterials and construction, to retard the spread of fire from within such\nfacilities, and shall be equipped so as not to be a hazard to the safety and\nhealth of occupants of the multiple dwelling. (c) Such motor vehicle storage facilities\nshall be arranged and constructed so that flammable vapors cannot spread to\nfixed sources of ignition; so that toxic gases and flammable vapors originating\nwithin such facilities cannot spread to the multiple dwelling; so that air for\nheating, ventilation and such uses cannot be circulated from such facilities to\nthe multiple dwelling. The floors of such facilities shall be of materials that\nwill not absorb flammable liquids nor be ignitable, and each floor shall slope\nto a floor drain equipped with an oil separator. Such oil separator shall be\nproperly maintained. (d) Motor\nvehicle storage facilities in or attached to a multiple dwelling shall be\nseparated from such dwelling by construction having a fire resistance rating\ncommensurate with the fire hazard involved. Such construction shall be\ncontinuous and unpierced by openings; except that openings shall be permitted\ntherein when equipped with self-closing opening protectives having a fire\nresistance rating commensurate with the fire resistance rating of the\nseparating construction, and when constructed in accordance with the\nrequirements of this Part. (e) Roof\nstorage. When motor vehicle storage facilities are provided on a roof, such\nroof shall be designed and constructed to support the resulting load; if such\nroof be the roof of a multiple dwelling, such dwelling shall be of fireproof\nconstruction. (f) Roof storage\nparapet wall. Roofs used for the storage of motor vehicles shall be provided\nwith a noncombustible parapet wall at least 24 inches high. Such wall shall be\ndesigned to resist a lateral horizontal force of 300 pounds per linear foot, applied 21 inches above the level of the roof. If a substantial eight-inch high\ncurb is provided at least four feet from the parapet wall, such wall need only\nbe designed to resist a lateral horizontal force of 150 pounds per linear foot. When the parapet wall is less than 42 inches high, a railing capable of\nresisting a lateral horizontal force of 100 pounds per linear foot applied at\nthe top rail shall be attached thereto. Such railing shall have a height of at\nleast 42 inches above the roof level and any opening therein shall not exceed\neight inches in at least one dimension. (g) Parking decks and open sides. Where a\nside of a motor vehicle storage facility is not enclosed, such side shall be\nprotected with a noncombustible wall at each floor level at least 24 inches in\nheight. Such wall shall be designed to resist a lateral horizontal force of 300\npounds per linear foot, applied 21 inches above the floor level. When an\neight-inch curb is provided at least four feet from the wall, such wall need\nonly be designed to resist a lateral force of 150 pounds per linear foot. When\nthe height of such wall above the floor level is less than 42 inches, a railing\ncapable of resisting a lateral horizontal force of 100 pounds per linear foot\napplied at the top rail shall be attached thereto. Such railing shall have a\nheight of at least 42 inches above the floor level and any opening therein\nshall not exceed eight inches in width and four feet in length. (h) Open storage. Motor vehicles stored in\nthe open upon the premises of a multiple dwelling shall not be stored within\nfive feet of a combustible wall or wall opening of that multiple dwelling, except when such wall is protected to a height of at least eight feet on the\nside nearest such storage by a noncombustible facing of at least three-quarter\nhour fire protection, and such openings are equipped with opening protectives\nhaving a fire resistance rating of at least three-quarter hour.
