  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 123.9 - Late not guilty plea\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf a motorist wishes to plead not guilty and the date to\nenter such a plea, as set forth in section\n123.7\nof this Part, has passed, he\nor she must plead in person at any hearing office. The administrative law judge\nmay direct that the suspension continue until the hearing, or require the\nmotorist to post the sum $40 for each ticket for which a plea is sought to be\nentered as security in order to terminate or withhold any suspension for\nfailure to appear on time; however, in no case shall a bond in excess of $160\nbe required for multiple tickets arising out of the same incident. If security is posted, it will be returned when the\nmotorist is found not guilty or the charge is dismissed for any reason or, if\nthe motorist found guilty, when the fine is paid. The security will be\nforfeited and the driver's license will be suspended if the motorist fails to\nappear or is not ready to proceed for a scheduled hearing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n123.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
