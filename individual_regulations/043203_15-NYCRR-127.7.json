Tit. 15 § 127.7 - Adjournments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Adjournments of\nhearings may only be granted by the hearing officer responsible for the\nparticular hearing, or by the Safety Hearing Bureau or the Division of Vehicle\n\nSafety, as appropriate. (b) It is\nthe department's general policy to grant a request for adjournment for good\ncause if such request is received at least seven days prior to the scheduled\ndate of hearing and if no prior requests for adjournment have been made. Notwithstanding this policy, requests for adjournments made more than seven\ndays prior to hearing may be denied by the hearing officer, or supervisor of\nthe hearing officer or by the Safety Hearing Bureau or Division of Vehicle\n\nSafety, in their discretion. Grounds for such a denial include, but are not\nlimited to, such a request being a second or subsequent request for\nadjournment, or where there is reason to believe such request is merely an\nattempt to delay the holding of a hearing, or where an adjournment will\nsignificantly affect the availability of other witnesses scheduled to\ntestify. (c) Any motorist or\ndesignated representative requesting an adjournment should obtain the name and\ntitle of the person granting such request. This information will be required in\nthe event of any dispute as to whether an adjournment was in fact granted. Any\nrequest which is not specifically granted shall be deemed denied. (d) Requests for adjournments within seven\ndays of a scheduled hearing must be made directly to the hearing officer. Such\nrequests will generally not be granted. (e) (1)\n\nExcept as provided for in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, in any\ncase where an adjournment is granted, any suspension or revocation of a\nlicense, permit or privilege already in effect may be continued pending the\nadjourned hearing. In addition, in the event no such action is in effect, a\ntemporary suspension of such license, permit or privilege may be imposed at the\ntime the adjournment is granted provided that the records of the department or\nthe evidence already admitted furnishes reasonable grounds to believe such\nsuspension is necessary to prevent continuing violations or a substantial\ntraffic safety hazard.

W here an adjournment of a chemical test refusal\nhearing is granted at the request of the respondent, any suspension of a\nrespondent's license, permit or privilege already in effect shall be continued\npending the adjourned hearing. In addition, in the event no such suspension is\nin effect when the adjournment is granted, a temporary suspension of such\nlicense, permit or privilege shall be imposed and shall take effect on the date\nof the originally scheduled hearing.

If respondent's\nlicense, permit or privilege was not suspended pending the hearing, the hearing\nofficer may suspend such license, permit or privilege, based upon the testimony\nprovided and evidence submitted at such hearing, if the hearing officer\naffirmatively finds on the record that there is reason to believe that the\nrespondent poses a substantial traffic safety hazard and sets forth the basis\nfor that finding on the record. (4)\n\nIn addition to any grounds for suspension authorized pursuant to paragraphs (2)\nand (3) of this subdivision, a hearing officer must impose a suspension or\ncontinue a suspension of a respondent's driver's license, pursuant to\nparagraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, if the respondent's record\nindicates that: (i) The person has been\nconvicted of homicide, assault, criminal negligence or criminally negligent\nhomicide arising out of the operation of a motor vehicle. (ii)\n\nThe person has two or more revocations\nand/or suspensions of his driver's license within the last three years, other\nthan a suspension that may be terminated by performance of an act by the\nperson.
