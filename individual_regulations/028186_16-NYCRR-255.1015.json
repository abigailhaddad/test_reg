  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.1015 - GDPIM plan requirements for a small liquified petroleum gas (LPG) operator\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. No later than August 2, 2011, or small LPG system must develop and\nimplement a GDPIM program that includes a written GDPIM plan as specified in\nsubdivision (b) of this section. The GDPIM program for these pipelines should\nreflect the relative simplicity of these types of pipelines. (b) Elements. A written GDPIM plan must\naddress, at a minimum, the following elements: (1)\n\nKnowledge. The operator must demonstrate\nknowledge of its pipeline, which, to the extent known, should include the\napproximate location and material of its pipeline. The operator must identify\nadditional information needed and provide a plan for gaining knowledge over\ntime through normal activities conducted on the pipeline (for example, design, construction, operations or maintenance activities). (2)\n\nIdentify threats. The operator must\nconsider, at a minimum, the following categories of threats (existing and\npotential): corrosion (including atmospheric corrosion), natural forces, excavation damage, other outside force damage, material or weld failure, equipment failure, and incorrect operation. (3)\n\nRank risks. The operator must evaluate\nthe risks to its pipeline and estimate the relative importance of each\nidentified threat. (4)\n\nIdentify and\nimplement measures to mitigate risks. The operator must determine and implement\nmeasures designed to reduce the risks from failure of its pipeline. (5)\n\nMeasure performance, monitor results, and\nevaluate effectiveness. The operator must monitor, as a performance measure, the number of leaks eliminated or repaired on its pipeline and their\ncauses. (6)\n\nPeriodic evaluation and\nimprovement. The operator must determine the appropriate period for conducting\nGDPIM program evaluations based on the complexity of its pipeline and changes\nin factors affecting the risk of failure. An operator must re-evaluate its\nentire GDPIM program at least every five years. The operator must consider the\nresults of the performance monitoring in these evaluations. (c) Records. The operator must\nmaintain, for a period of at least 10 years, the following records: (1)\na written GDPIM plan in accordance with\nthis section, including superseded GDPIM plans; (2)\ndocuments supporting threat\nidentification; and\n(3)\ndocuments\nshowing the location and material of all piping and appurtenances that are\ninstalled after the effective date of the operator's GDPIM program and, to the\nextent known, the location and material of all pipe and appurtenances that were\nexisting on the effective date of the operator's GDPIM program.
