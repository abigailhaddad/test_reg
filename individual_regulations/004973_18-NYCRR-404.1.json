When an\napplicant for social services is currently receiving public assistance or\nmedical assistance benefits, any relevant existing information, including, but\nnot limited to service goals and living arrangements, which is available\nthrough the WMS or other department system, must be used to avoid a duplication\nof efforts in the collection of information.
