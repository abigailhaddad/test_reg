  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 65-5.0 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For years, certain owners and operators of professional service corporations or other similar business entities have abused the no-fault insurance system. These persons are involved in activities that include intentionally staging accidents and billing no-fault insurers for health services that were unnecessary or never in fact rendered. This fraud costs no-fault insurers tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars, which insurers ultimately pass on to New York consumers in the form of higher automobile insurance premiums. It also threatens the affordability of health care and the public's health, safety, and welfare. (b) Insurance Law section 5109 requires the Superintendent of Financial Services, in consultation with the Commissioner of Health and the Commissioner of Education, to establish standards and procedures for the investigation and suspension or removal of a provider of health services' authorization to demand or request payment for health services provided under Insurance Law article 51. This Subpart implements Insurance Law section 5109. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n65-5.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
