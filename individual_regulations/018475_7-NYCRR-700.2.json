  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 700.2 - Who may appeal; timeliness\n\nState Regulations\nA purchaser of any correctional industries product or service\n(other than license plates) may appeal the price of the product or service to\nthe Price Review Board at any time prior to or within 30 days of the time of\nsale and upon payment of the price. The board may permit the filing of an\nappeal prior to actual payment of the price upon a satisfactory showing by\nappellant that it has completed all acts necessary on its part to make payment\nand that payment will be made no later than 60 days after the filing of the\nappeal. Where the board permits such an appeal to be filed prior to actual\npayment, and appellant thereafter fails to make actual payment within 60 days\nafter filing its appeal, such failure to pay shall divest the board of\njurisdiction and the appeal will be dismissed. The sole grounds for bringing\nsuch appeal is that the price as established by the commissioner unreasonably\nexceeds the fair market price for such goods or services as defined in this\n\nPart, or that the fair market price was not established in accordance with\nsection\n186 (2)\nof the Correction\n\nLaw. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n700.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
