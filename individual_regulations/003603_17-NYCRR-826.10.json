The original\nof form DOT-NY M.T. 3 shall be forwarded to the carrier issuing the tariff and\nshall by such carrier be transmitted to the commissioner with the tariff. This\nform when not restricted will serve as continuing evidence of participation in\nthe tariff described in the concurrence and in all supplements to and\nsuccessive issues thereof. If reference to successive issues be stricken out, a\nnew concurrence will be required for each successive issue of the tariff. Except as provided above, this form shall not be qualified in any way but must\nevidence concurrence in all rates, rules, or other provisions contained in the\ntariff publication named therein.

A general concurrence may be given by a carrier in\ntariffs issued by another carrier or an agent acting only for the carrier to\nwhich concurrence is given naming rates from or to points on the concurring\ncarrier's lines or over its lines. For this purpose, form DOT-NY M.T. 4 shall\nbe used, Form DOT-NY M.T. 4 may be executed as shown, when it will authorize\npublication of rates for the concurring carrier from and to points served by\nsuch carrier as well as from and to points served by other carriers where the\nconcurring carrier acts as an intermediate line. If it is desired to limit the\nauthority granted to exclude publication of rates in connection with which the\nconcurring carrier would act as either origin, intermediate or destination\nline, the form may be modified to that extent by substituting the words\n\"from-to\" for the words \"between-and\" or by use of other appropriate language\nto effect the desired modification. Authority given to an agent by such\nconcurrence is identical with that given to the carrier to which the\nconcurrence is given, and care must be exercised so that the rates published\nfor the concurring carrier do not exceed the scope of the authority so\ngiven. CONCURRENCE\nDOT-NY M.T. 4-No. ____\nCancels DOT-NY M.T. 4-No.____\n(Name of carrier)\n(Place and date)\n19__\nTo New York State Department of Transportation\n1220 Washington Ave. Albany, New York 12226\n\nThis is to certify that\n(Name of carrier giving\nthis concurrence; see Note 1, §\n826.9, subd.

(Name of carrier)\n\nBy_________\n(Signature)\n(Title)\n\nDuplicate mailed to__________at (show complete\naddress). (d) Revocation. A concurrence may be revoked upon not less than 60 days'\nnotice to the commissioner by filing a notice of revocation with the\ncommissioner, serving at the same time a copy thereof on the carrier to which\nsuch concurrence was given. Such notice shall not bear a separate serial\nnumber, but shall specify the form and number of the concurrence to be revoked, shall name the carrier in whose favor issued, and shall specify a date upon\nwhich revocation is to become effective, which must be not less than 60 days\nsubsequent to the date of its receipt by the commissioner. The revocation\nnotice shall be as follows: REVOCATION NOTICE\n(Name of carrier)\n(Place and date)\n19__\nTo New York State Department of Transportation\n1220 Washington Ave. Albany, New York 12226\n\nEffective ____, 19 __, concurrence form N.Y.-M.T.__ No. __, issued by __________\n(name of carrier)\nin favor of\n____________\n(here show name of carrier in whose favor concurrence was\nissued\n) is hereby canceled and revoked.

When a power of attorney or concurrence is revoked, corresponding revision of the tariff or tariffs should be made effective upon\nstatutory notice not later than the effective date stated in the notice of\nrevocation. In the event of failure so to revise the applicable tariff or\ntariffs, the rates in such tariff or tariffs remain in effect until lawfully\ncanceled. In the case of joint rates, the carrier having revoked its power of\nattorney or concurrence is thereafter entitled to earn its local rates. If the\ntariff is published by a carrier, such carrier will be held liable to the\ncarrier having revoked the concurrence for the difference in charges under the\ntariff as it is and as it would have been if corrected in accordance with\nrevocation of concurrence. In the case of tariffs published by an agent, the\nother carriers constituting the through joint route will be held responsible\nfor such differences in charges. (f) Duplicating authority. In giving concurrences care must be taken to avoid\nduplicating authority to two or more carriers which, if used, would result in\nconflicting rates or rules. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
