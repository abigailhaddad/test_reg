The division shall issue to the housing company a directive\nrequiring such submission, together with necessary forms and instructions, at\nleast 45 days prior to such deadline. (2)\n\nIf, based on the analysis of the proposed\nbudget, the division finds that projected revenues for the two-year period will\nbe sufficient to fund all housing company obligations, both current and\narrears, without a rental adjustment, it shall grant approval to the housing\ncompany of the two one-year budgets. Such approved budget may be as submitted\nby the company, as modified by the division, or as prepared by the division, as\nthe case may be.

(4)\n\nWere none of the factors listed in\nparagraphs (j)(1) through (8) of this section are present, the projections by a\nhousing company, other than a mutual housing company, do not result in an\nincrease in rent or carrying charges that exceed the percentage increase, as\nindicated by the change in the regional consumer price index for all urban\nconsumers, New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT-PA, under the\nsub-category of \"Rent of primary resident,\" as established the preceding\n\nOctober (\"CPI-U, New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT-PA, Rent of\n\nPrimary Residence, Not Seasonally Adjusted, 12 month percentage change for the\n12 months ending October\"), the division shall limit its independent\nprojections of the proposed budget to utilities and insurance and those other\nbudget items which in the experience of the division with such housing company: (i) are most susceptible to significant\nvariations within the period covered by the proposed budget; and\n(ii)\nwould have a significant effect on any\nadjustment to rent or carrying charges.
