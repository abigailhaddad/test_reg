In connection with the\nsuspension, demotion and displacement of noncompetitive class employees\nauthorized by section\n80-a\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law, the following terms shall mean: (1)\n\nRetreat shall mean displacement by a\npermanent incumbent of another incumbent serving in a position in the title in\nwhich the displacing incumbent served at a prior time as provided in\nsubdivision 4 of section\n80-a\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law. (2)\n\nSatisfactory\nservice shall mean service by an employee during the final rating period of\nwhich he did not receive an \"unsatisfactory\" performance rating and was not\nfound guilty of misconduct or incompetency pursuant to either section\n75\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law or a disciplinary procedure provided by labor contract which, in either case, resulted in the imposition of any of the following penalties\nupon such employee: (i) dismissal from the\nservice; (ii)\nsuspension without\npay for a period exceeding one month; or\n(iii)\ndemotion in grade and title. (b) Advance decisions. An appointing authority may take such steps as it may deem necessary in order\nto secure binding written commitments in advance of suspension, demotion or\ndisplacement from employees potentially affected by such suspension, demotion\nor displacement as to their willingness to accept reassignment or\ndisplacement. (c) Order of\ndisplacement. When two or more permanent incumbents of positions in a specific\ntitle are suspended, demoted or displaced at the same time, the order in which\nthey shall be entitled to displace shall be determined by their respective\nretention standing, with those having the greater retention standing entitled\nto displace first. (d) Displacement\nby probationers. (1)\n\nProbationer having a\nright to a permanent position. An employee who is serving a probationary term\nand who has a position formerly held by him on a permanent basis being held\nopen for him has no displacement rights from the position in which he is\nserving the probationary term pursuant to section\n80-a\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law and is afforded none by these rules. (2)\n\nProbationer without a right to a\npermanent position. An employee who is serving a probationary term and who has\nno position formerly held by him on a permanent basis being held open for him\nshall nevertheless have the possibility of displacing upon being suspended or\ndisplaced from the position wherein he is serving a probationary term; provided, however: (i) he has previously\ncompleted at least five years of continuous service which shall also have been\nsatisfactory service; and\n(ii)\nhe\nshall not be allowed to displace ahead of any permanent incumbents. The order\nof displacement among such probationers shall be determined by their respective\nretention standing, with those having the greater retention standing entitled\nto displace first. (e) Refusal or failure to accept appointment\nto a position afforded by displacement. The refusal or failure of a person to\naccept appointment to a lower grade position to which he is entitled through\ndisplacement shall not affect his right to be placed on a preferred list for\nthe position from which he was suspended, demoted or displaced. (f) Retreat where title of position has been\nchanged. A permanent incumbent who has been suspended or displaced shall be\nallowed to retreat to a position in which he last served even though the title\nof such position has been changed; provided, however, that there has been no\nsubstantial change in duties. (g) Preferred list standing for noncompetitive class employees shall be as follows: (1)\n\nBlind employees whose positions are\nabolished shall have their preferred list standing determined by the date of\ntheir original appointment on a permanent basis in the classified service, whether or not they are also disabled veterans or nondisabled veterans; provided, however, that the blind shall be granted absolute preference on the\npreferred list over all other employees. (2)\n\nDisabled veterans whose positions are\nabolished shall have their preferred list standing determined by the date of\ntheir original appointment on a permanent basis in the classified service; provided, however, that the date of such original appointment shall be deemed\nto be 60 months earlier than the actual date, determined in accordance with\nsection\n30\nof\nthe General Construction Law. (3)\n\nNondisabled veterans whose positions are abolished shall have their preferred\nlist standing determined by the date of their original appointment on a\npermanent basis in the classified service; provided, however, that the date of\nsuch original appointment shall be deemed to be 30 months earlier than the\nactual date, determined in accordance with section\n30\nof\nthe General Construction Law. (4)\n\nNonveterans whose positions are abolished shall have their preferred list\nstanding determined by the date of their original appointment on a permanent\nbasis in the classified service. (h) Adjunctive opportunities. (Pursuant to\nthe authority to provide adjunctive opportunities for displacement granted by\nsubdivision 4 of section\n80-a\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law.) A permanent incumbent having tenure protection, pursuant to\nparagraph (c) of subdivision 1 of section\n75\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law, who served in a position in State service and who was\nsuspended or displaced from such position, pursuant to section\n80-a\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law, shall displace the incumbent with the least retention right, pursuant to subdivisions 1 and 2 of such section, who is serving in a position\nin the title with a lower salary grade in which the displacing incumbent last\nserved on a permanent basis prior to service in one or more positions in the\ntitle from which he is suspended or displaced, if: (1)\nthe service of the displacing incumbent\nwhile in such former title was satisfactory; and\n(2)\nthe position of the junior incumbent is\nin: (i) the competitive, noncompetitive or\nlabor class; (ii)\nthe layoff unit\nfrom which the displacing incumbent was suspended or displaced; and\n(iii)\na lower salary grade than the position\nfrom which the displacing incumbent is suspended or displaced; provided, however, that no incumbent shall displace any other incumbent having greater\nretention standing. (i) Jurisdictional reclassification from\ncompetitive to noncompetitive class. (1)\n\nAn\nemployee who held a competitive class position by permanent appointment, which\nposition has been reclassified from the competitive to the noncompetitive\nclass, shall be accorded in such position the same protection as is afforded by\nsection\n80-a\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law and by this rule. (2)\n\nIn addition, a former competitive class\nemployee, who subsequent to the reclassification of his or her position to the\nnoncompetitive class is suspended or displaced from such position pursuant to\nsection\n80-a\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law, shall be entitled to exercise the same displacement rights\nhe or she would have been entitled to exercise had such position remained in\nthe competitive class.
