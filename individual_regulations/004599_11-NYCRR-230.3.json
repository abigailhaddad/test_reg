(ii)\nmethodologies for the identification and testing of all financial requirements and quantitative treatment limitations; and\n(iii)\nmethodologies for the identification and testing, including a comparative analysis, of all non-quantitative treatment limitations that are imposed on mental health or substance use disorder benefits; (3)\nmethodologies for the identification and remediation of improper practices, as described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section; (4)\na system for the ongoing assessment of parity compliance, which shall include: (i) review of a statistically valid sample of preauthorization, concurrent, and retrospective review denials for mental health and substance use disorder benefits to ensure such determinations were consistent with the clinical review criteria approved by the commissioner of mental health or designated by the commissioner of addiction services and supports, in consultation with the superintendent and commissioner of health, and that such criteria have been applied comparably to and no more stringently than criteria applied to medical or surgical benefits;

(iii)\nreview of the percentage of services provided by out-of-network providers for mental health and substance use disorder benefits where no in-network provider was available compared to the percentage of services provided by out-of-network providers for medical and surgical benefits where no in-network provider was available, to ensure that the processes and strategies for the recruitment and retention of mental health or substance use disorder providers are effective in reducing disparities in out-of-network use and to ensure there is an adequate network of mental health and substance use disorder providers to provide services on an in-network basis; (iv)\nreview of provider credentialing policies and procedures to ensure that the documentation and qualifications required for credentialing mental health and substance use disorder providers are comparable to and applied no more stringently than the documentation and qualifications required for credentialing medical or surgical providers and to ensure there is an adequate network of mental health and substance use disorder providers to provide services on an in-network basis; (v) review of the average length of time to negotiate provider agreements and negotiated reimbursement rates with network providers and methods for the determination of usual, customary and reasonable charges, to ensure that reimbursement rates for mental health and substance use disorder benefits are established using standards that are comparable to and applied no more stringently than the standards used for medical or surgical benefits and to ensure there is an adequate network of mental health and substance use disorder providers to provide services on an in-network basis; (vi)\nreview of insurer policies for the automatic or systematic lowering, non-payment or application of a particular coding for mental health and substance use disorder benefits to ensure that they are comparable to and applied no more than stringently than insurer policies for the automatic or systematic lowering, non-payment or application of a particular coding for medical or surgical benefits; (vii)\nreview of all mental health and substance use disorder medications subject to nonquantitative treatment limitations, including step-therapy protocols or other preauthorization requirements, to ensure that the factors, such as cost and latency periods, processes, strategies, and evidentiary standards the insurer relied upon to determine whether to apply the nonquantitative treatment limitation were comparable to and applied no more stringently than the factors, processes, strategies, and evidentiary standards the insurer relied upon to determine whether to apply nonquantitative treatment limitations, including step therapy or other preauthorization requirements, to medications to treat medical or surgical conditions; (viii)\nreview of any fail-first requirements applicable to mental health or substance use disorder benefits to ensure that they are comparable to and applied no more stringently than any fail-first requirements applicable to medical or surgical benefits;

(5)\na process for the actuarial certification, in compliance with actuarial standards of practice, of the data used for, and the outcome of, the analyses of the financial requirements and quantitative treatment limitations applicable to mental health and substance use disorder benefits to ensure that they are no more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements and quantitative treatment limitations applied to substantially all the medical and surgical benefits; (6)\ntraining and education on federal and state mental health and substance use disorder parity requirements for all employees, directors or other governing body members, agents, and other representatives engaged in functions that are subject to federal or state mental health and substance use disorder parity requirements or involved in analysis as a part of the compliance program;
