As used in this section the\nfollowing terms have these defined meanings: (1)\n\nAssociated equipment--equipment used in\nconjuction with a radiographic exposure device to make radiographic exposures\nthat drives, guides or comes in contact with the source, (i.e.,guide tube, control tube, crank, removable source stop, \"J\" tube). (2)\n\nCollimator--a device used to limit the\nsize, shape, and direction of the primary radiation beam. (3)\n\nControl (crank-out) device--the control\ncable, the protective sheath and control drive mechanism used to move the\nsealed source from its shielded position in the radiographic device or camera\nto an unshielded position outside the device for the purpose of making a\nradiographic exposure.

(7)\n\nPeriodic training--a periodic review\nconducted or provided by the licensee for its employees on radiation safety\naspects of radiography. The review may include, as appropriate, the results of\ninternal inspections, new procedures or equipment, accidents or errors that\nhave been observed, and opportunities for employees to ask safety\nquestions. (8)\n\nPermanent\nradiographic installation--an enclosed shielded room, cell, or vault in which\nradiography is performed. (9)\n\nProjection sheath (guide tube)--a flexible or rigid tube (i.e., \"J\" tube) for\nguiding the source assembly and the attached control cable from the exposure\ndevice to the exposure head or working position.
