  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 216.8 - Equipment requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Owners and\noperators of a blast furnace must not cause or allow emissions of particulates\nunless the blast furnace is equipped with: (1)\nan exhaust system to capture and contain\nthe emissions from the iron notch and trough between the furnace and skimmer\nduring the tapping of hot metal. The captured particulate emissions must be\nconveyed to and be collected by an air cleaning device. In addition to the\nother requirements of this Part, the exhaust gas must be cleaned by the air\ncleaning device so that gas released to the atmosphere complies with the\nemissions limitations in Table 1 of this Part; or\n(2)\nan emission suppression and shrouding\ncontainment system extending from the tap hole to the ends of all molten metal\nand slag runners. Containment of the emissions must be effectively maintained\nduring the tapping operation except when drilling and plugging the tap hole. Supression measures sufficient to adequately control the emissions must be\napplied during tapping at the discharge points of the molten metal and slag\nrunners and during drilling and plugging at the tap hole. (b) In addition to the requirements of\nparagraph (a)(1) of this section, owners and operators of a blast furnace\nconstructed after December 31, 1981 must not cause or allow emissions of\nparticulates unless the blast furnace is equipped with an exhaust system to\ncapture and contain the emissions from all molten metal and slag runners and\ndischarge points during the tapping of hot metal. The captured particulate\nemissions must be conveyed to and collected by an air cleaning device. In\naddition to the other requirements of this Part, the exhaust gas must be\ncleaned by the air cleaning device so that gas released to the atmosphere\ncomplies with the emission limitations in Table 1 of this Part. (c) Owners and operators of a basic oxygen\nfurnace must not cause or allow emissions of particulates unless the basic\noxygen furnace is equipped with both a primary exhaust system to capture and\ncontain all particulate emissions from the lancing and fluxing operations and a\nsecondary hood or a modification of the primary hood to capture and contain all\nparticulate emissions from the tapping operation. The captured particulate\nemissions must be cleaned by an air cleaning device that causes the exhaust gas\nemitted to the atmosphere to be in compliance with the emissions limitations in\n\nTable 1 of this Part. (d) Any person\nwho constructs or modifies an iron and/or steel process which is not a confined\nprocess must control the emissions of particulates to the outdoor atmosphere\nusing best available control technology. (e) Control device systems serving more than\none emission source must be capable of controlling all simultaneously generated\nemissions at the limits contained in Table 1 of this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n216.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
