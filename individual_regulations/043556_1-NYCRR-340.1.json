Tit. 1 § 340.1 - False or deceptive terms or devices; and other labeling requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No product, and\nno container thereof, shall be labeled with any false or deceptive name but\nestablished trade names which are usual to such articles and are not false or\ndeceptive and which have been approved by the commissioner may be\nused. (b) No statement, word, picture, design, or device, which is false or misleading in any particular or\nconveys any false impression or gives any false indication of origin, identity, or quality, shall appear on any label. For example: (1)\n\nOfficial grade designations such as the\nletter grades A, B, and C may be used in labeling individual carcasses of\npoultry and consumer packages of poultry and poultry products only if such\npoultry has been graded by a licensed grader of the Federal or Federal-State\npoultry grading service. (2)\n\nTerms\nhaving geographical significance with reference to a particular locality may be\nused only when the product was produced in that locality. (3)\n\nTerms, such as \"baby\", may be used to\nindicate immaturity of poultry which is marketed earlier than the usual\nmarketing age: provided, that such terms are printed in a style and size of\ntype no larger than is used to indicate the name of the\nproduct. (c) Poultry\nproducts which have been treated with compounds to retard spoilage shall be\nlabeled to indicate such treatment. (d) The terminology specified in paragraphs\n(1) through (10) of this subdivision are applicable to parts of poultry cut in\nthe manner described therein. (1)\n\nBreasts\nshall be separated from the back at the shoulder joint\nand by a cut running backward and downward from that point along the junction\nof the vertebral and sternal ribs. The ribs may be removed from the breasts, and the breasts may be cut along the breast bone to make two approximately\nequal halves; or the wishbone portion, as described in paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision, may be removed before cutting the remainder along the breast bone\nto make three parts. Pieces cut in this manner may be substituted for lighter\nor heavier pieces for exact weight-making purposes and the package may contain\ntwo or more of such parts without affecting the appropriateness of the labeling\nas \"chicken breasts\". Neck skin shall not be included with the\nbreasts. (2)\n\nBreasts with\nribs\nshall be separated from the back at the junction of the vertebral\nribs and back. Breasts with ribs may be cut along the breast bone to make two\napproximately equal halves; or the wishbone portion, as described in paragraph\n(3) of this subdivision, may be removed before cutting the remainder along the\nbreast bone to make three parts. Pieces cut in this manner may be substituted\nfor lighter or heavier pieces for exact weight-making purposes and the package\nmay contain two or more of such parts without affecting the appropriateness of\nthe labeling as \"breasts with ribs\". Neck skin shall not be included. (3)\n\nWishbones\n(pulley\nbones), with covering muscle and skin tissue, shall be severed from the breast\napproximately halfway between the end of the wishbone (hypocledium) and front\npoint of the breast bone (cranial process of the sternal crest) to a point\nwhere the wishbone joins the shoulder. Neck skin shall not be included with the\nwishbone. (4)\n\nDrumsticks\nshall be separated from the thigh by a cut through\nthe knee joint (femorotibial and patellar joint) and from the hock joint\n(tarsal joint). (5)\n\nThighs\nshall be disjointed at the hip joint and may include\nthe pelvic meat, but shall not include the pelvic bones. Back skin shall not be\nincluded. (6)\n\nLegs\nshall include the whole leg, i.e., the thigh and the\ndrumstick, whether jointed or disjointed. Back skin shall not be\nincluded. (7)\n\nWings\nshall include the entire wing with all muscle and skin\ntissue intact, except that the wing tip may be removed. (8)\n\nBacks\nshall include the\npelvic bones and all the vertebrae posterior to the shoulder joint. The meat\nshall not be peeled from the pelvic bones. The vertebral ribs and/or scapula\nmay be removed or included without affecting the appropriateness of the title. Skin shall be substantially intact. (9)\n\nStripped backs\nshall\ninclude the vertebrae from the shoulder joint to the tail, and include the\npelvic bones. The meat may be stripped off of the pelvic bones. (10)\n\nNecks, with or without\nneck skin, shall be separated from the carcass at the shoulder joint. (11)\n\nParts of poultry may be cut in any\nmanner the processor desires as long as the labeling appropriately reflects the\ncontents of the container of such poultry. (e) The name of the product required to be\nshown on labels for fresh or frozen raw whole carcasses of poultry shall be in\neither of the following forms: The name of the kind (such as chicken, turkey, or duck) preceded by the qualifying term \"young\" or \"mature\" or \"old\", whichever is appropriate; or the appropriate class name as described in\nsubdivision (f) of this section. The name of the kind may be used in addition\nto the class name, but the name of the kind alone without the qualifying age or\nclass term is not acceptable as the name of the product. The class name may be\nappropriately modified by changing the word form such as using the term\n\"roasting chicken\", rather than \"roaster\". The name \"chicken\" may be used\nwithout qualification with respect to a ready-to-cook pack of fresh or frozen\ncut-up young chickens, or a half of a young chicken, and the name \"duckling\"\nmay be used without qualification with respect to a ready-to-cook pack of fresh\nor frozen young ducks. The appropriate names for cut-up parts are set forth in\nsubdivision (d) of this section. When naming parts cut from young poultry, the\nidentity of both the kind of poultry and the name of the part shall be included\nin the product name.
