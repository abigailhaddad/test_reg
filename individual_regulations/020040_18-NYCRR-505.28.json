(3)\n\nSocial services district or MMCO\nresponsibilities. (i) Before developing a plan\nof care or authorizing services, a social services district or MMCO shall\nreview the individual's most recent independent assessment and practitioner\norder, and may directly evaluate the individual, to determine the following: (a) whether services can be provided\naccording to the individual's plan of care, whether such services are medically\nnecessary and whether the social services district or MMCO reasonably expects\nthat such services can maintain the individual's health and safety in his or\nher home, as determined in accordance with the regulations of the Department of\n\nHealth; (b) the individual's\nability and willingness to fulfill the consumer's responsibilities specified in\nsubdivision (h) of this section and, if applicable, the ability and willingness\nof the individual's designated representative to assume these\nresponsibilities; (c) the\nindividual's preferences and social and cultural considerations for the receipt\nof care; (d) whether the functional\nneeds, living and working arrangements of an individual who receives services\nsolely for monitoring the individual's medical condition and wellbeing can be\nmonitored appropriately and more cost-effectively by personal emergency\nresponse services provided in accordance with section\n505.33\nof this Part; (e) whether the individual can be served\nappropriately and more cost-effectively by other long-term care services and\nsupports, including, but not limited to the assisted living program or the\nenriched housing program; (f) whether services can be provided appropriately and more cost-effectively in\ncooperation with an adult day health or social adult day care\nprogram; (g) whether the\nindividual's needs can be met through the use of telehealth services that can\nbe demonstrated and documented to reduce the amount of services needed and\nwhere such services are readily available and can be reliably\naccessed; (h) whether the\nindividual can be served appropriately and more cost-effectively by using\nadaptive or specialized medical equipment or supplies covered by the medical\nassistance program including, but not limited to, bedside commodes, urinals, walkers, wheelchairs and insulin pens; (i) whether the consumer's needs can by met\nthrough the provision of formal services provided or funded by an entity, agency or program other than the medical assistance program; and\n(j) whether the consumer's needs can be met\nthrough the voluntary assistance available from informal caregivers including, but not limited to, the consumer's family, friends or other responsible adult, and whether such assistance is available. (ii)\n\nThe social services district or MMCO\nmust first determine whether the individual, because of the individuals'\nmedical condition, would be otherwise eligible for personal care services, including continuous personal care services or live-in 24-hour personal care\nservices. For individuals who would be otherwise eligible for personal care\nservices, the district must then determine whether, and the extent to which, the individual can be served through the provision of services described in\nsubparagraphs (i)(d) through (i)(j) of this paragraph. (a) If a social services district or MMCO\ndetermines that an individual can be served appropriately and more\ncost-effectively through the provision of services described in subparagraphs\n(i)(d) through (i)(g) of this paragraph, and the social services district or\nMMCO determines that such services are available in the district to the\nindividual, the social services district or MMCO must consider the use of such\nservices as well the individuals identified preferences and social and cultural\nconsiderations described in subparagraph (i)(c) of this paragraph in developing\nthe individual's plan of care. (b) If a social services district or MMCO determines that other formal services are\navailable or the individual's needs can be met using available adaptive or\nspecialized medical equipment or supplies or voluntary assistance from informal\ncaregivers, as described in subparagraphs (i)(h) through (i)(j) of this\nparagraph, the social services district or MMCO must include these in the\nindividual's plan of care. To ensure availability of voluntary informal\nsupports, the social services district or MMCO must confirm the caregiver's\nwillingness to meet the identified needs in the plan of care for which they\nwill provide assistance. (iii)\n\nFor cases involving live-in 24-hour\nconsumer directed personal assistance, the social services district or MMCO\nshall evaluate whether the consumer's home has sleeping accommodations for a\nconsumer directed personal assistant. When the consumer's home has no sleeping\naccommodations for a consumer directed personal assistant, continuous consumer\ndirected personal assistance must be authorized for the consumer; however, should the consumer's circumstances change and sleeping accommodations for a\nconsumer directed personal assistant become available in the consumer's home, the district or MMCO must promptly review the case. If a reduction of the\nconsumer's continuous consumer directed personal assistance to live-in 24-hour\nconsumer directed personal assistance is appropriate, the district must send\nthe consumer a timely and adequate notice of the proposed reduction. (iv)\n\nFor cases involving continuous consumer\ndirected personal assistance and live-in 24-hour consumer directed personal\nassistance cases, the social services district or MMCO shall assess and\ndocument in the plan of care the following: (a) whether the practitioner order indicated\na medical condition that causes the consumer to need frequent assistance during\na calendar day with toileting, walking, transferring, turning and positioning, feeding, home health aide services, or skilled nursing tasks; (b) the specific functions or tasks with\nwhich the consumer requires frequent assistance during a calendar\nday; (c) the frequency at which the\nconsumer requires assistance with these functions or tasks during a calendar\nday; (d) whether the consumer\nrequires similar assistance with these functions or tasks during the consumer's\nwaking and sleeping hours and, if not, why not; and\n(e) whether, were live-in 24-hour consumer\ndirected personal assistance to be authorized, the consumer directed personal\nassistant would be likely to obtain, on a regular basis, five hours daily of\nuninterrupted sleep during the aide's eight hour period of sleep. (v) The social services district\nor MMCO is responsible for developing a plan of care in collaboration with the\nconsumer or, if applicable, the consumer's designated representative that\nreflects the assessments and practitioner order described in this subdivision. In the plan of care, the social services district or MMCO must identify: (a) the personal care services, home health\naide services and skilled nursing functions or tasks with which the consumer\nneeds assistance; (b) the amount, frequency and duration of services to be authorized to meet these\nneeds; (c) how needs are met, if\nnot met through the authorization of services; and\n(d) any other descriptions and documentation\nprovided for in this section. (vi)\n\nUpon the development of a plan of care, the social services district or MMCO shall refer high needs cases described in\nparagraph (5) of this subdivision to the independent review panel; provided, however, that an MMCO should not refer a case unless and until the individual\nis enrolled or scheduled for enrollment in the MMCO. When a case is referred to\nthe independent review panel: (a) the social\nservices district or MMCO shall provide the individual's plan of care and any\nclinical records or other documentation used to develop the plan of care, such\nas records from treating providers and the results of any review or evaluation\nperformed pursuant to this paragraph to the panel; (b) the social services district or MMCO\nshall cooperate with the panel as appropriate to ensure an expedient review of\neach high needs case; and\n(c) the\nsocial services district or MMCO shall consider the panel's recommendation in\nfinalizing the plan of care and authorization. However, The social services\ndistrict or MMCO is not required to adopt the recommendation, either in full or\nin part, and remains responsible for determining the amount and type of\nservices medically necessary. (4)\n\nCoordinating the independent assessment, practitioner order and LDSS or MMCO responsibilities. (i) The social services district or MMCO must\ncoordinate with the entity or entities providing independent assessment and\npractitioner services to minimize disruption to the consumer and in-home\nvisits. (ii)\n\nThe social services\ndistrict or MMCO must inform the entity or entities providing independent\nassessment and practitioner services when a new assessment or practitioner\norder is needed pursuant to subdivision (f)(1)(ii) and subdivision (f)(2) of\nthis section, in accordance with department guidance, using forms as may be\nrequired by the department. (a) When the\nsocial services district or MMCO receives an initial or new request to\nparticipate in the consumer directed personal assistance program, it shall\nrefer the individual to the entity providing independent assessment services\nand provide assistance to the individual in making contact in accordance with\ndepartment guidance; provided however that the social services district or MMCO\nmay not pressure or induce the consumer to request an assessment\nunwillingly. (b) If needed, the\nMMCO shall also refer the individual to the social services district to\ndetermine the individual's eligibility for medical assistance, including\ncommunity-based long term care services. (iii)\n\nThe entity or entities providing\nindependent assessment or practitioner services may request that the social\nservices district or MMCO confirm or update a consumer's record in the\nassessment database designated by the Department. The social service district\nor MMCO shall respond within one business day and confirm or update the\nrelevant record within three business days after receipt of request. (iv)\n\nResolving mistakes and clinical\ndisagreements in the assessment process. (a) If the social services district or MMCO identifies a material mistake in the\nindependent assessment that can be confirmed by the submission of evidence, the\nsocial services district or MMCO shall advise the independent assessor. A\nmistake is an error of fact or observation that occurred when the assessment\nwas performed that is not subject to the independent assessor's clinical\njudgment. A mistake is material when it would affect the amount, type, or\nduration of services authorized. When identifying the mistake, the social\nservices district or MMCO must provide evidence of the mistake to the\nindependent assessor. The independent assessor shall promptly issue a corrected\nassessment or schedule a new assessment in accordance with clause (c) of this\nsubparagraph as appropriate. (b) After reviewing the independent assessment, practitioner order and the result\nof any social service district or MMCO assessment or evaluation, if the social\nservices district or MMCO has a material disagreement regarding the outcome of\nthe independent assessment, the social services district or MMCO may advise the\nindependent assessor. A disagreement occurs when the social services district\nor MMCO disputes a finding or conclusion in the independent assessment that is\nsubject to the independent assessor's clinical judgment. A disagreement is\nmaterial when it would affect the amount, type, or duration of services\nauthorized. When submitting a disagreement to the independent assessor, the\nsocial services district or MMCO must provide the clinical rationale that forms\nthe basis for the disagreement. (c) Upon submission of a material disagreement, an independent assessor shall\nschedule and complete a new assessment within 10 days from the date it receives\nnotice from the social services district or MMCO. This shall not pend or\notherwise affect the timeframes within which the social services district or\nMMCO is required to make a determination, provide notice, or authorize\nservices. (v) Sanctions\nfor failure to cooperate and abuse of the resolution process. (a) The Department of Health may impose\nmonetary penalties pursuant to Public Health Law section 12 for failure to\ncoordinate with the entity or entities providing independent assessment and\npractitioner services in accordance with the provisions of clauses (a) through\n(c) of this subparagraph or engaging in abusive behavior that affects the\ncoordination of the assessment process. In determining whether to impose a\nmonetary penalty and the amount imposed, the Department shall consider, where\napplicable, the following: (1)\n\nThe frequency\nand numerosity of violations, both in absolute terms and relative to other\nMMCOs; (2)\n\nThe responsiveness of\nthe MMCO to requests for coordination; (3)\n\nThe history of coordination between the\nMMCO and the entity or entities; (4)\n\nThe good faith demonstrated by the MMCO\nin attempting to coordinate; (5)\n\nWhether the MMCO provides a justification for the violation and whether it has\nmerit, as determined by the Department; (6)\n\nWhether the violation resulted or could\nhave resulted in injury or other harm to the consumer; and\n(7)\n\nOther relevant facts or\ncircumstances. (b) The\n\nDepartment of Health may revoke, or impose other restrictions on a social\nservices district's or MMCO's privilege to request reassessments on the basis\nof a material disagreement where the Department determines that the social\nservices district has abused this privilege, including the use of the mistake\nprocess for issues subject to clinical judgment or improperly pressuring\nconsumers to request a new assessment. In determining whether a social services\ndistrict or MMCO has abused this privilege, the Department shall consider, where applicable, the following: (1)\n\nThe\nfrequency and numerosity of disagreements, mistakes, and reassessment requests\nsubmitted to the independent assessor, both in absolute terms and relative to\nother social services districts and MMCOs; (2)\n\nWhether the clinical rationale provided\nfor the disagreement has merit, as determined by the Department; (3)\n\nWhether the disagreement, mistake, and\nreassessment requests are made as a matter of course, instead of upon review of\nthe clinical record; (4)\n\nThe\noutcome of the reassessment as compared to the assessment it replaces; and\n(5)\n\nOther facts or\ncircumstances that tend to provide evidence for or against abuse. (c) Nothing in this section shall\nbe construed to limit the authority of the Department or other agencies to seek\nother remedies, sanctions or penalties, including other monetary\npenalties. (5)\n\nIndependent medical review of high needs\ncases. An independent medical review of a proposed plan of care\nshall be obtained before a social services district or MMCO may authorize more\nthan 12 hours of personal care services or consumer directed personal\nassistance, separately or in combination, per day on average (\"high needs\ncases\"). The review shall result in a recommendation made to the social\nservices district or MMCO, as described in this paragraph. (i) The independent medical review must be\nperformed by an independent panel of medical professionals, or other\nclinicians, employed by or under contract with an entity designated by the\n\nDepartment of Health (the \"independent review panel\"). (ii)\n\nThe case review shall be coordinated by\na physician (the \"lead physician\") who shall be selected from the independent\nreview panel. The lead physician may not be the same person who performed the\ninitial medical examination or signed the individual's practitioner\norder. (iii)\n\nThe lead physician\nmust review the independent assessment, practitioner order, any other\nassessment or review conducted by the social services district or MMCO, including any plan of care created. (iv)\n\nThe lead physician may evaluate the\nindividual, or review an evaluation performed by another medical professional\non the independent review panel. The medical professional may not have\nperformed the initial medical examination or signed the individual's\npractitioner order. (v) The lead\nphysician and panel members may consult with or interview other members of the\nindependent review panel, the ordering practitioner, the individual's treating\nor primary care physician, and other individuals that the lead physician deems\nimportant and who are available to assist with the panel's review. (vi)\n\nThe lead physician and panel members may\nrequest such additional information or documentation, including medical\nrecords, case notes, and any other material the lead physician deems important\nto assist the panel's review and recommendation. (vi)\n\nAfter review, the independent review\npanel shall produce a report, signed by the lead physician, providing a\nrecommendation on the reasonableness and appropriateness of the proposed plan\nof care to maintain the individual's health and safety in his or her own home, in accordance with the standards and scope of services set forth in this\nsection. The report may suggest modifications to the plan of care, including\nthe level, frequency, and duration of services and whether additional, alternative, or fewer services would facilitate the provision of medically\nnecessary care. The report may not, however, recommend a specific amount or\nchange in amount of services. (e) Authorization process. (1)\n(i) An\nindividual's eligibility for medical assistance and services, including the\nindividual's financial eligibility and eligibility for the consumer directed\nprogram and services thereunder as provided for in this section, shall be\nestablished prior to authorization for services. The entity designated by the\n\nDepartment of Health to provide independent assessment services shall be\nresponsible for determining whether individuals meet minimum needs requirements\nfor services. (ii)\n\nThe\nauthorization must be completed by the social services district or MMCO prior\nto the initiation of services. In the case of the social services district, the\nauthorization of services shall be prepared by staff of the social services\ndistrict and such responsibility may not be delegated to another person or\nentity. (iii)\n\nThe authorization and\nreauthorization of services, including the level, amount, frequency and\nduration of services, by the social services district or MMCO must be based on\nand reflect the outcome of the assessment process outlined in subdivision (d)\nof this section except as otherwise provided in subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (iv)\n\nWhen the social\nservices district or MMCO determines pursuant to the assessment process that\nthe individual is eligible to participate in the consumer directed personal\nassistance program, the district or MMCO must authorize consumer directed\npersonal assistance according to the consumer's plan of care. The district or\nMMCO must not authorize consumer directed personal assistance unless it\nreasonably expects that such assistance can maintain the individual's health\nand safety in the home or other setting in which consumer directed personal\nassistance may be provided. (v) The\nsocial service district or MMCO shall not authorize services provided through\nmore than one fiscal intermediary per consumer. (vi)\n\nConsumer directed personal assistance, including continuous consumer directed personal assistance and live-in 24-hour\nconsumer directed personal assistance, shall not be authorized to the extent\nthat the social services district or MMCO determines that any of the services\nor supports identified in clauses (h) through (i) of subdivision (d)(3)(j) of\nthis section are available and appropriate to meet the consumer's needs and are\ncost-effective if provided instead of consumer directed personal\nassistance. (2)\n\nThe\ndistrict or MMCO may authorize only the hours or frequency of services that the\nconsumer actually requires to maintain his or her health and safety in the\nhome. (3)\n\nThe duration of the\nauthorization period must be based upon the consumer's needs as reflected in\nthe required assessments and plan of care. In determining the authorization\nperiod, the social services district must consider the consumer's prognosis and\npotential for recovery and the expected duration and availability of any\ninformal supports or alternative services identified in the plan of\ncare. (4)\n\nThe social services\ndistrict or MMCO may not authorize more than 12 hours of personal care services\nper day on average prior to considering the recommendation of the independent\nreview panel in accordance with procedures outlined in paragraphs (3) and (5)\nof subdivision (d), unless such authorization is ordered pursuant to a fair\nhearing decision or by another court of competent jurisdiction. Pending review\nof the independent review panel's recommendation and if necessary to comply\nwith federal or state timeliness requirements, including immediate needs cases, the social services district or MMCO may authorize and implement services based\non a temporary plan of care which provides for more than 12 hours of personal\ncare services per day on average. (5)\n\nNo authorization may exceed 12 months\nfrom the date of the most recent independent assessment or practitioner order, whichever is earlier. (6)\n\nThe\nsocial services district or MMCO must provide the consumer with a copy of the\nplan of care that specifies the consumer directed personal assistance that the\ndistrict or MMCO has authorized the consumer to receive and the number of hours\nper day or week of such assistance. (7)\n\nNothing in this subdivision precludes the\nprovision of the consumer directed personal assistance program in combination\nwith other services when a combination of services can appropriately and\nadequately meet the consumer's needs; provided, however, that no duplication of\n\nMedicaid-funded services would result. (f) Reassessment and reauthorization\nprocesses. (1)\n\nPrior to the end of the\nauthorization period, the social services district or MMCO must determine the\nconsumer's continued eligibility for the consumer directed personal assistance\nprogram in accordance with the assessment process set forth in subdivision (d)\nof this section, except as otherwise provided for in this subdivision. (i) The social services district or MMCO must\nevaluate whether the consumer or, if applicable, the consumer's designated\nrepresentative satisfactorily fulfilled the consumer's responsibilities under\nthe consumer directed personal assistance program. The social services district\nor MMCO must consider whether the consumer or, if applicable, the consumer's\ndesignated representative has failed to satisfactorily fulfill the consumer's\nresponsibilities when determining whether the consumer should be reauthorized\nfor the consumer directed personal assistance program. (ii)\n\nNeither an independent assessment nor a\npractitioner order shall be required to reauthorize or continue an\nauthorization of services, except: (a) prior\nto or in conjunction with a discharge from an institutional or in-patient\nsetting, provided that this provision shall not be construed to prohibit a safe\ndischarge from occurring; (b) as\nprovided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision; (c) that an individual in receipt of services\nmay request a new independent assessment; and\n(d) an individual in receipt of services must\nreceive an independent assessment and practitioner order at least annually to\nmaintain authorization. (iii)\n\nWhen the social services district or\nMMCO determines, pursuant to the reassessment process, that the consumer is\neligible to continue to participate in the consumer directed personal\nassistance program, the district or MMCO must reauthorize consumer directed\npersonal assistance in accordance with the authorization process specified in\nsubdivision (e) of this section. When the district or MMCO determines that the\nconsumer is no longer eligible to continue to participate in the consumer\ndirected personal assistance program, the district or MMCO must send the\nconsumer, and such consumer's designated representative, if any, a timely and\nadequate notice under Part 358 and Subpart 360-10 of this Title of the\ndistrict's or MMCO's intent to discontinue consumer directed personal\nassistance on forms required by the department. (2)\n\nThe social services district or MMCO must\nreassess the consumer when an unexpected change in the consumer's social\ncircumstances, mental status or medical condition occurs during the\nauthorization period that would affect the type, amount or frequency of\nconsumer directed personal assistance provided during such period. The district\nor MMCO is responsible for making necessary changes in the authorization or\nreauthorization on a timely basis in accordance with the following procedures: (i) when the change in the consumer's service\nneeds results solely from an unexpected change in the consumer's social\ncircumstances including, but not limited to, loss or withdrawal of informal\nsupports or a designated representative, the social services district or MMCO\nmust review the independent assessment, document the consumer's changed social\ncircumstances and make changes in the authorization or reauthorization as\nneeded. A new practitioner order and independent assessment are not required; or\n(ii)\nwhen the change in the\nconsumer's service needs results from a change in the consumer's mental status\nor medical condition, including loss of the consumer's ability to make\njudgments or to instruct, supervise or direct the consumer directed personal\nassistant, the social services district or MMCO must obtain a new independent\nassessment and practitioner order. (3)\n\nWhen there is any change in the\nindividual's service needs, a social services district or MMCO shall consider\nsuch changes and document them in the plan of care, and shall consider and make\nany necessary changes to the authorization. (g) Timeframes for the assessment and\nauthorization of services\n(1)\n\nThe\nindependent assessment and practitioner order processes shall be completed at\nleast annually and in sufficient time such that social services districts and\nMMCOs may have an opportunity when needed to comply with all applicable federal\nand state timeframes for notice and determination of services, including but\nnot limited to immediate needs. (2)\nA social services district must make a determination and provide notice with\nreasonable promptness, not to exceed seven business days after receipt of both\nthe independent assessment and practitioner order, or the independent review\npanel recommendation if applicable, except in unusual circumstances including, but not limited to, the need to resolve any outstanding questions regarding the\namount or duration of services to be authorized, or as provided in subdivision\n(l) of this section. (3)\n\nAn MMCO\nmust make a determination and provide notice to current enrollees within the\ntimeframes provided in the contract between the Department of Health and the\nMMCO, or as otherwise required by Federal or state statute or\nregulation. (h) Consumer and designated representative responsibilities. (1)\nA consumer or, if applicable, the\nconsumer's designated representative has the following responsibilities under\nthe consumer directed personal assistance program: (i) managing the plan of care including\nrecruiting and hiring a sufficient number of individuals who meet the\ndefinition of consumer directed personal assistant, as set forth in subdivision\n(b) of this section, to provide authorized services that are included on the\nconsumer's plan of care; training, supervising and scheduling each assistant; terminating the assistant's employment; and assuring that each consumer\ndirected personal assistant competently and safely performs the personal care\nservices, home health aide services and skilled nursing tasks that are included\non the consumer's plan of care; (ii)\ntimely notifying the social services\ndistrict or MMCO of any changes in the consumer's medical condition or social\ncircumstances including, but not limited to, any hospitalization of the\nconsumer or change in the consumer's address, telephone number or\nemployment; (iii)\ntimely notifying\nthe fiscal intermediary of any changes in the employment status of each\nconsumer directed personal assistant; (iv)\nattesting to the accuracy of each\nconsumer directed personal assistant's time sheets; (v) transmitting the consumer directed\npersonal assistant's time sheets to the fiscal intermediary according to its\nprocedures; (vi)\ntimely\ndistributing each consumer directed personal assistant's paycheck, if\nneeded; (vii)\narranging and\nscheduling substitute coverage when a consumer directed personal assistant is\ntemporarily unavailable for any reason; and\n(viii)\nentering into a department approved\nmemorandum of understanding with the fiscal intermediary and with the social\nservices district or MMCO that describes the parties' responsibilities under\nthe consumer directed personal assistance program. (2)\nthe designated representative must make\nthemselves available to ensure that the consumer responsibilities are carried\nout without delay. In addition, designated representatives for\nnonself-directing consumers must make themselves available and be present for\nany scheduled assessment or visit by the independent assessor, examining\nmedical professional, social services district staff or MMCO staff. (3)\nA consumer, or if applicable the\nconsumer's designated representative, may not work with more than one fiscal\nintermediary at a time. Where more than one fiscal intermediary is serving the\nsame consumer at a given time, the consumer is required to select a single\nfiscal intermediary to work with in accordance with guidance provided by the\n\nDepartment. (i) Social services district and MMCO responsibilities. Social\nservices districts or MMCOs have the following responsibilities with respect to\nthe consumer directed personal assistance program: (1)\ncomplying with the assessment, authorization, reassessment and reauthorization procedures specified in\nsubdivisions (d) through (f) of this section; (2)\nreceiving and promptly reviewing, the\nfiscal intermediary's notification to the district or MMCO pursuant to\nsubparagraph (j)(1)(v) of this section of any circumstances that may affect the\nconsumer's or, if applicable, the consumer's designated representative's\nability to fulfill the consumer's responsibilities under the program and making\nchanges in the consumer's authorization or reauthorization as needed; (3)\ndiscontinuing, after timely and adequate\nnotice in accordance with Part 358 and Subpart 360-10 of this Title, the\nconsumer's participation in the consumer directed personal assistance program\nand making referrals to other services that the consumer may require when the\ndistrict or MMCO determines that the consumer or, if applicable, the consumer's\ndesignated representative is no longer able to fulfill the consumer's\nresponsibilities under the program or no longer desires to continue in the\nprogram; (4)\nnotifying consumers of\nthe district's or MMCO's decision to authorize, reauthorize, increase, reduce, discontinue or deny services under the consumer directed personal assistance\nprogram. The Department of Health may require the use of forms it develops or\napproves when providing such notice; (i) Social services districts or MMCOs that deny, reduce or discontinue services\nbased on medical necessity must identify and document in the notice and in the\nconsumer's plan of care the factors that demonstrate such services are not\nmedically necessary or are no longer medically necessary. Any such denial or\nreduction in services must clearly indicate a clinical rationale that shows\nreview of the consumer's specific clinical data and medical condition; the\nbasis on which the consumer's needs do not meet specific benefit coverage\ncriteria, if applicable; and be sufficient to enable judgment for possible\nappeal. (ii)\n\nAppropriate reasons\nand notice language to be used when denying consumer directed personal\nassistance include but are not limited to the following: (a) the consumer's health and safety cannot\nbe reasonably assured with the provision of consumer directed personal\nassistance.

(iii)\n\nAppropriate reasons and notice language\nto be used when reducing or discontinuing consumer directed personal assistance\ninclude but are not limited to the following: (a) the consumer's medical or mental\ncondition or economic or social circumstances have changed and the district\ndetermines that the consumer directed personal assistance provided under the\nlast authorization or reauthorization are no longer appropriate or can be\nprovided in fewer hours. This includes but is not limited to cases in which: the consumer's health and safety can no longer be reasonably assured with the\nprovision of consumer directed personal assistance; the consumer's medical\ncondition is no longer stable; the consumer is no longer self-directing and has\nno designated representative to assume those responsibilities; or voluntary\ninformal supports that are acceptable to the client have become available to\nmeet some or all of the client's needs.
