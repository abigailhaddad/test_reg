  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 82-3.10 - Probable cause hearing for certain suspensions without pay\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In accordance with Education Law\n§3020-a(2)(c), where a board suspends an employee without pay pending a\ndetermination in an expedited hearing based on charges of misconduct\nconstituting physical or sexual abuse of a student, a probable cause hearing\nshall be conducted pursuant to this section within ten (10) days of the\ndecision to suspend without pay. Such unpaid suspension shall not exceed 120\ndays from the decision of the board of education to suspend the employee\nwithout pay\n(b) Probable cause\nhearing procedures\n(1)\nA school district\nshall notify the Commissioner of a request for a probable cause hearing within\none (1) business day of suspending an employee without pay based on charges of\nmisconduct constituting physical or sexual abuse of a student. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall maintain a\nrotational list or lists of individuals who have agreed to serve as impartial\nhearing officers in accordance with the timeframes and conditions set forth in\n\nEducation Law §3020-a(2)(c). The Commissioner, in his discretion, may remove a\nhearing officer from the rotational list, if he or she engages in a pattern of\ndeclinations or is unable to perform his/her duties in the timelines prescribed\nin Education Law §3020-a(2)(c) or this Subpart. A pattern of declinations is\ndefined as two (2) or more declinations within one year. If a hearing officer\nis removed, he or she may make an application to be reinstated after one year, which may be granted in the Commissioner's discretion. (3)\n\nUpon receipt of request for a need for a\nprobable cause hearing, the Commissioner shall appoint the next available\nhearing officer from the rotational list. The failure of the hearing officer to\naccept the case within 24 hours of being notified that he or she has been\nselected shall be deemed a declination. (4)\n\nAt the conclusion of the probable cause\nhearing, the impartial hearing officer may make an oral ruling or issue a\nwritten decision on the record as to whether the decision to suspend an\nemployee without pay should be continued or reversed. (5)\n\nThe impartial hearing officer shall\nreverse the decision of the board to suspend without pay and reinstate the pay: (i) upon a finding that probable cause does\nnot support the charges; or\n(ii)\nupon a written determination that suspension without pay is grossly\ndisproportionate in light of all surrounding circumstances. (6)\n\nThe employee shall be eligible\nfor reimbursement of the withheld pay and accrued interest at the rate of six\npercent compounded annually if the hearing officer finds in the employee's\nfavor, at either in the probable cause hearing or in a final determination at\nthe conclusion of the expedited hearing.
