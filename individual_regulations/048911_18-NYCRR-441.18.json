  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 441.18 - Children's privacy rights\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe provisions contained in this section shall apply\nunless a condition in a court order provides to the contrary. Such condition\nshall be documented in the child's record. (a) Mail. (1)\nA child in care has an unrestricted right\nto send mail without prior censorship or prior reading. (2)\nA child in care has the right to receive\nmail without prior reading or prior censorship. However, an authorized child\ncare agency or foster family boarding home may require the child to open the\nmail in the presence of a staff member or the foster parent if there is\nreasonable cause to suspect the delivery of contraband (\ne.g., drugs or weapons). (3)\n\nNothing\ncontained in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision shall be construed to\npermit a child's use of mail for fraudulent, illegal or illicit\npurposes. (4)\n\nAs part of a\ntreatment plan developed or approved by the local social services district\ncaseworker who has case management responsibility for a child, and in\nconsultation with the authorized agency or foster parent, the authorized child\ncare agency or foster parent may require that a child open mail arriving from a\npredesignated person in the presence of a staff member or foster parent. Such a\nsituation might arise when it is anticipated that mail from a parent or other\nperson is likely to cause emotional harm to a child, and that such potential\nharm could be lessened with the presence of a staff member or foster parent. The child shall be informed of this aspect of the treatment plan when it is\nestablished and the reason(s) for its implementation. (b) Telephone. (1)\nA child in care shall have the right to\nreceive or refuse any and all calls made to him/her during reasonable hours to\nbe set by the authorized agency or foster parent. (2)\nA child in care shall be allowed to call\nany person of his/her choosing; however, the time, duration and cost of such\ncalls may be restricted by the limits of the authorized agency's or foster\nfamily boarding home's policies for access and utilization of the\ntelephone. (3)\n\nNothing contained in\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision shall be construed to permit a\nchild's use of the telephone for fraudulent, illegal or illicit\npurposes. (4)\n\nExcept at the child's\nrequest, neither agency staff nor foster parents shall listen in on a child's\nphone conversation. An area which affords the child a reasonable degree of\nprivacy shall be provided for the purpose of receiving and initiating phone\ncalls whenever it is physically possible to provide such an area.

(3)\n\nThe\nchild must be present during the search of a child's room, locker or\npossessions, unless to do so would compromise an agency or criminal\ninvestigation or the safety of the child or others at the program or foster\nhome.
