  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 629.2 - Eligibility Criteria\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. This section applies to any person applying to OPWDD for a determination of\nwhether the person has a qualifying condition that meets the criteria of\ndevelopmental disability, as set forth in Mental Hygiene Law (MHL) § 1.03(22), making them eligible for certain OPWDD operated, certified, funded and/or\nauthorized services. (b) General\n\nEligibility Provisions. (1)\n\nEligibility is\ndetermined by the consistent application of criteria described in subdivisions\n(c) through (f) of this section, based on the definition of developmental\ndisability established in MHL § 1.03(22). (2)\n\nTo be eligible for OPWDD services, the\nperson seeking eligibility must be a New York State resident or intend to\nreside in New York State at the time the services are delivered. (3)\n\nThe process for reviewing eligibility\nrequests is described in section\n629.1\nof this\n\nPart. (c) Qualifying\n\nConditions. (1)\n\nQualifying conditions must\nmeet the criteria set forth in MHL § 1.03(22)(a). (2)\n\nQualifying related conditions under MHL §\n1.03(22)(a)(2) must be closely related to intellectual disability, including\nthat they must cause or result from injury to, or dysfunction, disorder, or\nimpairment of, the central nervous system. (3)\nA valid diagnosis of a qualifying condition named in MHL §\n1.03(22)(a)(1) or related condition as defined in MHL § 1.03(22)(a)(2) is\nrequired. (d) Functional\n\nLimitations. (1)\n\nWhether a person's\nfunctional limitations satisfy the requirement of substantial handicap under\nMHL § 1.03(22)(d) is determined by at least one acceptable assessment. Assessments are acceptable only when they: (i) use comprehensive, nationally normed and validated individual\nmeasures; (ii)\nare administered and\ninterpreted by a qualified practitioner; and\n(iii)\nfollow appropriate administration\nguidelines. (2)\n\nFunctional limitations are considered a substantial handicap when they are\nassociated with, attendant to, or result from, a qualifying condition as\ndescribed in subdivision (c) of this section, and: (i) they prohibit the person from being able\nto function independently in daily life; or\n(ii)\nwhen the development of the person's\nfunctional skills related to daily living are significantly below the\nexpectations given the person's age; and\n(iii)\nthe limitations are consistent with\ndeficits in adaptive functioning as described in paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nIntellectual Functioning. (i) Significant\nlimitations in general intellectual functioning must be determined from the\nfindings of one or more acceptable assessments. Assessments are acceptable only\nwhen they employ an independent measure of intelligence that is: (a) comprehensive, nationally normed, and\nvalidated; (b) administered in a\nstandardized format; (c) administered in its entirety; (d) administered in accordance with standardization procedures; and\n(e) interpreted by a qualified\npractitioner. (ii)\n\nIn\nexceptional circumstances, OPWDD may accept non-standardized testing formats if\nappropriate rationale and justification is clearly documented. (iii)\n\nFunctional limitations must not be\npresumed solely based on below average scores on assessments of intellectual\nfunctioning. (4)\n\nAdaptive\n\nFunctioning. (i) Significant limitations in\nadaptive functioning must be determined from the findings of one or more\nacceptable assessments. Assessments are acceptable only when they employ an\nindependent measure of intelligence that is: (a) comprehensive, nationally normed and\nvalidated; (b) administered in a\nstandardized format; (c) administered in its entirety; (d) administered in accordance with standardization procedures; and\n(e) interpreted by a qualified\npractitioner. (ii)\n\nAdaptive behavior measures that do not provide an overall composite score, multiple domain scores, or skill area scores will not be considered for\ndetermining the presence of functional limitations that constitute a\nsubstantial handicap. (iii)\n\nThe\nrequirement of a substantial handicap may be satisfied if the overall composite\nscore, or the majority of domain or specific skill area/subdomain scores, fall\ntwo or more standard deviations below the mean on a comprehensive and validated\nmeasure of adaptive behavior. (iv)\n\nIf adaptive behavior measures that permit assessment of both adaptive and\nmaladaptive behavior are used, a finding of clinically significant maladaptive\nbehaviors will not constitute a substantial handicap without a concurrent\nfinding of significant limitations in adaptive behavior. (v) An assessment of significant limitations\nin adaptive behavior, on its own, must not constitute a basis upon which the\npresence of significantly below average intellectual functioning is\npresumed. (5)\n\nCo-occurring Disorders. (i) The requirement\nof a substantial handicap is not satisfied if significant functional\nlimitations are determined to be the result of a current acute or severe phase\nof a psychiatric disorder or a consequence of the person's psychiatric\ndisorder, substance use, or substance-related\ndisorder. (e) Onset. (1)\n\nTo satisfy the requirements of MHL\n§ 1.03(22)(b), the qualifying condition, as described in subdivision (c) of\nthis section, and the associated functional limitations, as described in\nsubdivision (d) of this section, must verifiably be established to have\noccurred before the person reached the age of 22. (2)\n\nThe person seeking eligibility, or other\nrelevant party, must submit historical medical records establishing the onset\nof their qualifying condition and functional limitations before the age of 22. In cases where such records are presumed to no longer exist, the person seeking\neligibility must make requests for this information and document both the\nrequest for information and the response to the request. (3)\n\nIf no information is available to\ndetermine the age of onset, Developmental Disabilities Regional Offices may\nrely on other sources of information to determine the age of onset, including\nthe informed clinal judgment of appropriately licensed\nprofessionals. (f) Indefinite Duration. (1)\n\nTo satisfy the\nrequirements of MHL § 1.03(22)(c), there must be a reasonable likelihood of\nindefinite continuation of the qualifying condition, as described in\nsubdivision (c) of this section, and of the associated functional limitations, as described in subdivision (d) of this section.
