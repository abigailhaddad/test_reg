  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 859.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases herein after\nmentioned shall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I of\nthis Part an item number is assigned to each specifically designated waters or\nportions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas appearing in table I of this Part shall\nmean that number or abbreviation which has been assigned to any specifically\ndesignated waters or portions thereof for the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering of index system used to\nidentify specific waters of New York State was adapted from that used by the\n\nNew York State Conservation Department in its biological survey series of\nreports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a drainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name or an\nabbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Saw Mill River watershed and has been closely followed in connection with\nthe identification of the waters with the following exceptions: some of the\nstream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the\ntime of its survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the newer maps are\ndesignated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Saw Mill River drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters Index\n\nNumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\nH-4 portion as described\n\nSaw Mill River\n4th trib. of Hudson River, enters from east near\n\nYonkers (Map R-24a). H-4-24 portion as described\n\nTrib. of Saw Mill River, known as Nannyhagen\n\nBrook\n24th trib. of Saw Mill River, which enters from\nnortheast approximately 0.6 mile west of Thornwood (Map Q-24d). H-4-24-1\n\nTrib. of Nannyhagen Brook\n\nTrib. 1 enters trib. 24 from east (Map Q-24d). H-4-24-P19c and P19e\n\nTwin Lakes\n\nPonds or lakes located at headwaters of Nannyhagen\n\nBrook (Map Q-24b). (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary\nand\nsubtributaries, respectively, shall mean any stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water\nwhich flows into any other stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no trubutaries or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond or other body of\nsurface water referenced by such waters index number; where tributaries or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface\nwater referenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and\nsubtributaries thereof, which are shown on the reference maps, unless\nexceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I of this Part shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically\ndesignated waters are generally known and which may appear on the reference\nmaps. In cases of specifically designated waters which have no name, the named\ntributary to which the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I of this Part shall mean a\nbrief indication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries may include designations of segments or sections of waters to which a\nparticular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also\ninclude any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. (f) Map ref. no. as appearing in table I of this Part means map reference number\nand indicates one or more of the following numbered maps reproduced herein\ncompletely, or in part, on which the specifically designated waters and their\nindex numbers are shown. The following maps were produced from original maps\nwhich may be procured through the Washington Distribution Section, U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). Map ref. no. Name of\nquadrangle\n\nPublished by\n\nEdition\n\nMap 1\n\nYonkers, N.Y. (R-24a)\nUSGS\n1943\n\nMap 1\n\nMount Vernon, N.Y. (R-24b)\nUSGS\n1943\n\nMap 2,3\n\nWhite Plains, N.Y.

(Q-24b)\nUSGS\n1943\n(g) Class\nas appearing in\ntable I, and denoted by the letters SB, A, B, C or D opposite each specifically\ndesignated waters, shall mean class SB, A, B, C or D, as the case may be, as\nset forth in Part 701, supra. (h) Standards\nas appearing\nin table I, and denoted by the letters SB, A, B, C or D, opposite each\nspecifically designated waters shall mean the standards of quality and purity\nestablished for class SB, A, B, C or D, or as the case may be, as set forth in\n\nPart 701, supra. The symbol (T) appearing after any standard\ndesignation shall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and that the\ndissolved oxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol\n(TS) after any standard designation shall mean that the designated waters are\nsuitable for trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen specification for\ntrout spawning waters shall apply thereto. (i) The term\ntrout\nas used\nin this Part means any fish in the following genera: Coregonus, Oncorhynchus, Prosopium, Salmo, Salvelinus, and\n\nThymallus. (j) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich appear as lines to indicate natural waters on the reference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated in table I of this Part, shall be\nassigned the same classes and standards of quality and purity as the\nspecifically designated waters to which they are directly tributary. (k) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standards as the waters to which it is\ndirectly tributary. (l) The Saw\n\nMill River drainage basin shall be deemed to include the following areas: all\nland and water areas, the natural surface water drainage from which is directly\nor indirectly tributary to the Saw Mill River. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n859.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
