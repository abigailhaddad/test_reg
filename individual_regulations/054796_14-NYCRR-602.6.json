  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 602.6 - Hearing procedures: denial of operating certificate renewal hearings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. In addition to section\n602.2\nof this Part, this section\nshall apply to hearings held when the office proposes to deny an operating\ncertificate holder's application for renewal of an operating certificate. Where\na conflict exists between this section and section\n602.2\nof this Part, the provisions\nof this section shall be controlling. (b) Hearing requests. The denial of renewal shall be final, unless the operating\ncertificate holder requests a hearing in writing within 30 days of service of\nnotice of the proposed action. Such request shall be made to the commissioner, and shall include a copy of OPWDD's notice of proposed action. The request must\nalso include a declaration of the issues alleged to be involved, and\ndocumentation of the provider's position as to each identified issue. (c) Stay of execution of\nproposed action. Except as provided for in Mental Hygiene Law, section\n16.17(b), if the party makes a valid hearing request, the execution of any\nproposed action shall be stayed pending a final determination by the\ncommissioner after a recommendation by a hearing officer. (d) The operating certificate holder must\nserve on the division of the office which issued the statement of issues and\nthe hearing officer an answer, signed by the holder, no later than three days\nbefore the initial hearing date. (e) Burden of proof. The OPWDD shall present its case first. The burden of proof\nshall be on the OPWDD to present evidence of the provider's failure to operate\nthe facility in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations at the\ntime of the survey of the facility by OPWDD, or that the criteria for initial\ncertification are no longer being met. (f) When the office seeks the denial of\nrenewal of an operating certificate previously granted by the OPWDD, either\nparty shall, upon demand and at least seven days prior to the hearing, disclose\nthe evidence that the party intends to introduce at the hearing, including\ndocumentary evidence and identification of witnesses; provided, however, the\nprovisions of this subdivision shall not be deemed to require the disclosure of\ninformation or material otherwise protected by law from disclosure, including\ninformation and material protected because of privilege or confidentiality. If, after such disclosure, a party determines to rely upon other witnesses or\ninformation, the party shall, as soon as practicable, supplement its disclosure\nby providing the names of such witnesses or the additional documents.
