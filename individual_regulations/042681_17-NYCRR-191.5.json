  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 191.5 - Illustrative examples of various hazards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Highways without sidewalks or\nadequate shoulders. A 4th grade child going to an elementary school must walk\nfour feet from the roadway on a shoulder along a two lane road for a distance\nof 1/2 mile. If the road is posted at 50 mph, with a 15 minute vehicular\ntraffic count of 120, the situation would produce the following points: HAZARD TYPE - HIGHWAYS WITHOUT\nSIDEWALKS OR ADEQUATE SHOULDERS\n1. Shoulder < five feet wide, 1/2\nmile\n6 points\n2. 120 vehicles per 15 minutes\n5\n3. 50 mph\n3\nHAZARD TYPE - HIGHWAY INTERSECTIONS\n4. Does not cross highway\n0\n5. N/A\n0\n6. N/A\n0\nHAZARD TYPE - HIGHWAY-RAILROAD\nGRADE CROSSINGS\n7. Does not cross railroad tracks\n0\n14 points\n\nResult: CSZ established for grades K - 8\n\nNo CSZ established for grades 9 - 12\n\nTo establish a CSZ, 12 points are required for a 4th grade\nstudent and 15 points for students in grades 9 - 12. The situation meets the\ncriteria for establishing a CSZ for students in grades K - 8 since 14 points\nwere calculated. However, a CSZ is not justified for students in grades 9 -\n12. (b) Highways\nwithout sidewalks or adequate shoulders. A family has a 3rd grade child and an 9th grade child going\nto schools at the same location. They must walk 1050 feet on a two lane roadway\nposted at 40 mph with no shoulder or sidewalk. Recent traffic counts indicate\nthat 600 vehicles per hour use the roadway during the morning walk to school. Each child would have the following points: HAZARD TYPE-HIGHWAYS W/O SIDEWALKS\nOR ADEQUATE SHOULDERS\n1. No Shoulder, 1050 feet\n4 points\n2. 600 vph (150 veh per 15 minutes)\n5\n3. 40 mph\n1\nHAZARD TYPE-HIGHWAY INTERSECTIONS\n4. Does not cross highway\n0\n5. N/A\n0\n6. N/A\n0\nHAZARD TYPE-HIGHWAY-RAILROAD GRADE\nCROSSINGS\n7. Does not cross railroad tracks\n0\n10 points\n\nResult: No CSZ established for grades K - 8\n\nNo CSZ established for grades 9 - 12\n\nTo establish a CSZ, 12 points are required for a 3rd grade\nstudent and 15 points for students in grades 9 - 12. The situation does not\nmeet the criteria for establishing a CSZ for students in grades K - 8 since 10\npoints were calculated. Also, a CSZ is not justified for students in grades 9 -\n12. (c) Highway\nintersections. An 8th grade child walking to a middle school on a sidewalk\nmust cross Central Avenue, a four lane highway with a posted speed limit of 45\nmph. Traffic is not required to stop on Central Avenue, only on the\nintersecting side streets. A 15 minute vehicular traffic count generated 200\nvehicles on Central Avenue. The child would have the following points: HAZARD TYPE - HIGHWAYS W/O\nSIDEWALKS OR ADEQUATE SHOULDERS\n1. Sidewalk\n0 points\n2. N/A\n0\n3. N/A\n0\nHAZARD TYPE - HIGHWAY\nINTERSECTIONS\n4. Cross 4 lane roadway w/o traffic\ncontrol\n12\n5. 200 vehicles per 15 minutes\n5\n6. 45 mph traffic on Central Avenue\n2\nHAZARD TYPE - HIGHWAY-RAILROAD\nGRADE CROSSINGS\n7. Does not cross railroad tracks\n0\n19 points\n\nResult: CSZ established for grades K - 8\nCSZ established for grades 9 - 12\n\nTo establish a CSZ, 12 points are required for an 8th grade\nstudent and 15 points for students in grades 9 - 12. The situation meets the\ncriteria for establishing a CSZ for students in grades K - 8 since 14 points\nwere calculated. A CSZ is also justified for students in grades 9 - 12. (d) Highway-railroad\ncrossings. A 5th grade child walking to school on a sidewalk must\ncross two adjacent railroad tracks. If this location has two trains crossing\ndaily during the one hour period children are going to school and one train\ncrossing daily during the one hour period children are returning from school, there would be a total of three trains, and the situation would produce the\nfollowing points: HAZARD TYPE - HIGHWAYS W/O\nSIDEWALKS OR ADEQUATE SHOULDERS\n1. Sidewalk\n0 points\n2. N/A\n0\n3. N/A\n0\nHAZARD TYPE - HIGHWAY\nINTERSECTIONS\n4. Does not cross highway\n0\n5. N/A\n0\n6. N/A\n0\nHAZARD TYPE - HIGHWAY-RAILROAD\nGRADE CROSSINGS\n7. Cross 2 tracks, 3 trains\n13\n13 points\n\nResult: CSZ established for grades K - 8\n\nNo CSZ established for grades 9 - 12\n\nTo establish a CSZ, 12 points are required for an 8th grade\nstudent and 15 points for students in grades 9 - 12. The situation meets the\ncriteria for establishing a CSZ for students in grades K - 8 since 13 points\nwere calculated. However, a CSZ is not justified for students in grades 9 -\n12. (e) Combination\nof two greatest hazards. A sophomore student going to a high school must walk four\nfeet from the roadway on a shoulder along a two lane road for a distance of 1/2\nmile. The road is posted at 35 mph, with a 15 minute vehicular traffic count of\n240. The student must also cross Main Street, a three lane highway with a\nposted speed limit of 45 mph. Traffic is controlled by a traffic signal with\npedestrian indications. A 15 minute vehicular traffic count generated 200\nvehicles on Main Street. The situation would produce the following\npoints: HAZARD TYPE-HIGHWAYS W/O SIDEWALKS\nOR ADEQUATE SHOULDERS\n1. Shoulder < 5 feet wide, 1/2 mile\n6 points\n2. 240 veh per 15 minutes on two lane\nroad\n5\n3. 35 mph on two lane roadway\n0\n11 points\nHAZARD TYPE-HIGHWAY\nINTERSECTIONS\n4. Cross Main Street, 3 lanes, traffic signal with\npedestrian indications\n3\n5. 200 veh per 15 minutes on Main Street\n5\n6. 45 mph on Main street\n2\n10 points\nHAZARD TYPE-HIGHWAY-RAILROAD GRADE\nCROSSINGS\n7. Does not cross railroad tracks\n0\n0 points\n\nSum of Two Greatest Hazards\n21 points\n\nResult: CSZ established for grades K - 8\n\nNo CSZ established for grades 9 - 12\n\nTo establish a CSZ, 12 points are required for an 8th grade\nstudent and 15 points for students in grades 9 - 12. The situation does not\nmeet the criteria for establishing a CSZ based on a single hazard for students\nin grades K - 8 or grades 9 - 12. However, when the two greatest hazards are\ncombined, the criteria is met for grades K - 8 since 21 points were calculated. However, a CSZ is not justified for students in grades 9 - 12. (f) Combination of two\ngreatest hazards. A sophomore student going to a high school must walk four\nfeet from the roadway on a shoulder along a two lane road for a distance of.8\nmile (4224 feet). The road is posted at 35 mph, with a 15 minute vehicular\ntraffic count of 240. The student must also cross Main Street, a three lane\nhighway with a posted speed limit of 45 mph. Traffic is controlled by a traffic\nsignal without pedestrian indications. A 15 minute vehicular traffic count\ngenerated 200 vehicles on Main Street. In addition, the student must cross a\nhighway-railroad grade crossing with one track. This location has one train\ncrossing daily during the one hour period children are going to school and one\ntrain crossing daily during the one hour period children are returning from\nschool. Therefore, there would be a total of two trains, and the situation\nwould produce the following points: HAZARD TYPE - HIGHWAYS W/O\nSIDEWALKS OR ADEQUATE SHOULDERS\n1. Shoulder < 5 feet wide,.8 mile\n9 points\n2. 240 veh per 15 minutes on two lane\nroad\n5\n3. 35 mph on two lane roadway\n0\n14 points\nHAZARD TYPE - HIGHWAY\nINTERSECTIONS\n4. Cross Main Street, 3 lanes, traffic signal\nwithout pedestrian indications\n6\n5. 200 veh per 15 minutes on Main Street\n5\n6. 45 mph on Main street\n2\n13 points\n\nResult: CSZ established for grades K - 8 based on 1\nhazard\nCSZ established for grades 9 - 12 based on 2 hazards\n\nTo establish a CSZ, 12 points are required for students in\ngrades 8 - 12 and 15 points for students in grades 9 - 12. The situation does\nmeet the criteria for establishing a CSZ based on a single hazard for students\nin grades K - 8 as there are two individual hazards with 13 and 14 points\nrespectively. However, the criteria is not met for students in grades 9 - 12. If the two greatest hazards are combined, the criteria is met for both grades K\n- 8 and 9 - 12 since 27 points were calculated.
