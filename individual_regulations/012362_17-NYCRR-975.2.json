  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 975.2 - Basic eligibility requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn order to receive funds under the Statewide Mass\n\nTransportation Operating Assistance Program (STOA) for mass transportation\nservices, all participants must be public transportation systems as defined in\nthis Part. Only those public transportation systems eligible under the rules\nand regulations established for the section 18-b program are authorized to\nreceive supplemental or special operating assistance under section 88-a of the\n\nFinance Law. The quarterly applications of unspecified bus systems under the\nformula portion of the program must meet the definition of bus system and\ncontain only revenue passengers and revenue vehicle miles in accordance with\nthe provisions of this Part. (a) Public transportation system shall mean any public benefit corporation\nconstituting a transportation authority, or subsidiary thereof, which provides\nor contracts for the provision, under joint support arrangements, of mass\ntransportation services; any Indian tribe which provides or any county or city\nwhich provides or contracts for the provision, pursuant to section\n119-r\nof the General Municipal Law, of mass transportation services that directly\nserve or primarily benefit its residents, or any intercity bus company which\ncontracts with the commissioner to provide mass transportation services in\nexchange for State transit operating assistance. (b) Mass transportation services eligible for\n\nState transportation operating assistance shall mean commuter rail, subway, rapid transit, bus and commuter ferry revenue services, available to the public\non a regular and continuing basis, having predetermined and publicly posted\nfares and service hours. Fixed route or route deviation services (not demand\nresponsive) shall also have printed schedules. Demand-responsive services must\nhave published service areas, hours of operation, fares and the phone number to\narrange for service. Such services shall be between an origin and destination, both of which are within the boundaries of New York State. Services that, due\nto geographic locations or routing, operate in a state other than New York in\nproviding services to passengers that have origins and destinations in New York\n\nState, are eligible for state operating assistance provided that the primary\nreason for operating outside New York State is to transport New York State\npassengers to and from their New York State origins and destinations. However, the commissioner may review such services under the provisions of section\n975.9\n(a) of this\n\nPart to ensure that the assistance will be used exclusively for the benefit of\n\nNew York State riders. The public transportation system must also meet the\nrequirements of section\n975.20\nof this Part if the\norganization providing the service receives 50 percent or more of its revenue\nfrom human services agency contracts or if the organization previously or\ncurrently provides substantial services for clients of human service\nagency(ies). While eligible services must be available to the general public, some portion(s) of a public system's services may be oriented to address the\nneeds of the transit disabled (as defined in section\n975.4\n[k]\nof this\n\nPart). The transit disabled services must also satisfy the provisions of\nsection\n975.19\nof this Part. School\ntripper services consistent with the criteria contained in section\n975.4\n(v) of this\n\nPart are also eligible to receive STOA. If yellow school buses are to be used\nfor STOA eligible services, prior approval must be obtained from the department\nbefore such services are to be considered eligible for STOA. Exceptions for the\nuse of yellow school buses may be granted if the system demonstrates that: (1)\nno other vehicles are available to\nprovide the service on an interim basis; (2)\nthat it would be a financial hardship to\nobtain non-yellow buses even for an interim period; and\n(3)\nno State Education Department funding is\navailable for the services in question. Also, the yellow school buses to be\nused must satisfy minimum adult seating/standing requirements as identified by\nthe Department's Traffic and Safety Division's Regulations 921.7 and 921.8. Any\nyellow buses utilized for STOA-eligible services are not permitted to either\ndisplay school bus\" signs or use \"flashing red lights,\" or they will be\nconsidered to be providing exclusive school bus services. Services defined as ineligible for state transportation\noperating assistance include: exclusive airport services (as defined by Section\n975.4\n(s) ), special charter operations, exclusive school bus operations (including services\nprovided by school district owned transportation systems, services provided\nunder contract with private school bus operators and school service provided by\nregular transit operators under purchase of service contracts), transportation\nservices provided by client agencies that are designed only to meet the\nspecific needs of their clients, sightseeing services, deadheading (as defined\nby Section\n975.4\n(u); hotel\ncontract services, van services (as defined in subdivision 35 of Section\n2\nof the\n\nTransportation Law), services which are held out to be, are designed to be, or\nbecome transportation services primarily to serve gambling casinos or bingo\nparlors or services commonly known as \"invalid coach service\" or \"ambulette\nservices\" or services on routes or trips not available to the general public\nexcept as defined above. Also defined as ineligible services are any services\nauthorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission after November 19, 1982\nwithout corresponding intrastate authority issued by the New York State\n\nDepartment of Transportation, if NYSDOT determines that intrastate authority\nshould have been sought pursuant to the New York State Bus Regulatory Reform\n\nAct (Chapter 635 of the Laws of 1983). (c) Revenue vehicle, nautical ferry, or car\nmile shall mean the movement of one bus vehicle, ferryboat or rail car\nproviding mass transportation services for a distance of one mile in revenue\nservice. This shall include local and to the end point of the revenue trip\ncommuter services (initial and return trip) and intercity route mileage that\nmeets the mass transportation services provisions identified in section\n975.2\n(b). Deadhead mileage is not eligible for calculating STOA service payments (see\nsection\n975.4\n(u). (d) Revenue passenger shall mean a person who\nis transported between an origin and destination, both of which are within New\n\nYork State, by mass transportation services, for whom a per-passenger fare is\ncollected by the public transportation system. Such per-passenger fare or\ntransfer fee shall be at least thirty cents per rider (fifteen cents for the\nelderly, transit disabled, and the young) for unspecified systems where the\nquarterly service payment is determined based on quarterly revenue vehicle mile\nand revenue passenger statistics. Persons are not to be included who ride or\ntransfer free onto or within the system except as noted below. If a local\ngovernment chooses to, it may provide the public transportation system with\nadditional voluntary local subsidies (beyond those required to satisfy any\nminimum local match requirements) in order for the system to count those riders\nthat would otherwise not be considered eligible passengers under the minimum\nfares. It will be necessary to show that these additional local government fare\nsubsidies were provided on a per-passenger and/or a per-transfer basis. If the\nfare for a class of riders (e.g., elderly, disabled, students) is subsidized in\nwhole, or in part, through a contract, the appropriate portion of this contract\nrevenue must be provided and counted as farebox revenue at a per-passenger rate\ncommensurate with the established fare structure. If this per-passenger rate\nalso satisfies the minimum fare levels established above, these riders can also\nbe considered eligible passengers under this program. Estimated revenue\npassenger statistics, if submitted, must also satisfy the provisions identified\nin section\n975.7\non statistical\nsampling. (e) Bus services shall\nmean mass transportation services provided by a person, firm or corporation\nauthorized by the Commissioner of Transportation, the appropriate New York City\nregulatory agency or the Interstate Commerce Commission to serve the general\npublic on an individual fare basis, or such public transportation services when\noperated by a municipal agency or public benefit corporation, or subsidiary\nthereof, in accordance with federal, state and local laws. When provided by a\nperson, firm or corporation, that entity must have passenger transportation as\nits primary purpose as stated in its certificate of incorporation. Eligible bus\nservices shall be limited to those provided in motor vehicles having a\nmanufacturer's rated carrying capacity of fifteen or more passengers, excluding\nthe driver. Exceptions will be granted for use of motor vehicles having a\ncapacity of 8 to 14 passengers when it is determined by the Commissioner that\nthe use of motor vehicles having a capacity of 15 or more passengers is not the\nmost effective and efficient means of providing basic mobility to: (1)\ntransit disabled individuals in urbanized\nareas; and, (2)\npersons, who by\nreason of physical, economic or other circumstances, do not have access to\nprivate personal transportation or are unable to use private personal\ntransportation, either permanently or temporarily.
