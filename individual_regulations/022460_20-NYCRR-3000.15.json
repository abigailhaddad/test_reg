After issue is joined (see\nsection\n3000.4\n[c]\nof this Part), the administrative law judge unit shall schedule the controversy\nfor a hearing. The parties shall be given at least 30 days' notice of the first\nhearing date, and at least 10 days' notice of any adjourned or continued\nhearing date. A request by any party for a preference in scheduling will be\nhonored to the extent possible. (b) Adjournment; default. (1)\n\nAt the written\nrequest of either party, made on notice to the other party and received 15 days\nin advance of the scheduled hearing date, an adjournment may be granted where\ngood cause is shown. In the event of an emergency, an adjournment may be\ngranted on less notice. Upon continued and unwarranted delay of the proceedings\nby either party, the administrative law judge shall render a default\ndetermination against the dilatory party. (2)\n\nIn the event a party or the party's\nrepresentative does not appear at a scheduled hearing and an adjournment has\nnot been granted, the administrative law judge shall, on his or her own motion\nor on the motion of the other party, render a default determination against the\nparty failing to appear. (3)\n\nUpon\nwritten application to the supervising administrative law judge, a default\ndetermination may be vacated where the party shows an excuse for the default\nand a meritorious case. (c) Administrative law judge. The hearing\nshall be conducted by an impartial administrative law judge who is authorized\nto: (1)\nadminister oaths and\naffirmations; (2)\nsign and issue\nsubpoenas as provided in section\n3000.7\nof\nthis Part; (3)\nregulate the course\nof the hearings, set the time and place for continued hearings, and fix the\ntime for filing of legal memoranda and other documents; (4)\nrule upon questions of evidence; such\nrulings shall be deemed incorporated in the administrative law judge's\ndetermination for purposes of review by the tribunal; and\n(5)\nrender determinations after\nhearings. (d) Conduct of\nhearing. (1)\n\nAt the hearing, the parties may\ncall and examine witnesses, introduce exhibits, cross-examine opposing\nwitnesses on any matter relevant to the issues even though the matter was not\ncovered in direct examination, impeach any witness regardless of which party\nfirst called the witness to testify, and rebut the evidence against them. All\nwitnesses shall testify under oath or by affirmation. The office of counsel\nshall introduce a copy of each statutory notice at issue or satisfactory\nevidence that each such statutory notice has in fact been issued. A copy of a\n\nFederal determination relating to the issues may be received in evidence to\nshow such determination. Affidavits as to relevant facts may be received, for\nwhatever value they may have, in lieu of the oral testimony of the persons\nmaking such affidavits. Technical rules of evidence will be disregarded to the\nextent permitted by the decisions of the courts of this State, provided the\nevidence offered appears to be relevant and material to the issues. However, effect shall be given to the rules of privilege recognized by law. Objections\nto evidentiary offers may be made and shall be noted in the record. Upon a\nfinding of good cause, the administrative law judge may order that any witness\nbe examined separately and apart from all other witnesses, except those who are\nparties. The administrative law judge may, where the record appears unclear, ask questions of the parties or of witnesses for the purpose of clarifying the\nrecord. (2)\n\nWhere books, records, papers or other documents have been received in evidence, the substitution of a\ncopy thereof may be permitted. Where original exhibits have been received in\nevidence, the party who offered such exhibits may be permitted to withdraw them\nafter the determination of the administrative law judge or the decision of the\ntribunal is final. (3)\n\nIf a party\nrefuses or fails without reasonable cause to obey any subpoena or subpoena\nduces tecum issued by an administrative law judge, the administrative law judge\nshall have the power to preclude the noncomplying party from introducing any\nproofs concerning such witnesses, documents or things, or from introducing them\nin evidence and may draw the inference that the precluded evidence is\nunfavorable to the noncomplying party's position. (4)\n\nFor purpose of expedition, stipulation\nand submission of evidence is encouraged, provided the interests of parties\nwill not be substantially prejudiced thereby. Although objections to a\nparticular part of a stipulation should be noted therein, the administrative\nlaw judge will give consideration to any objection to irrelevancy of stipulated\nfacts made at the hearing (see section\n3000.11\nof this Part). (5)\n\nThe burden of\nproof shall be upon the petitioner, except as otherwise provided by\nlaw. (6)\n\nAfter the parties have\ncompleted the submission of the evidence, they may orally argue the\napplicability of the law to the facts. If the parties also wish to submit\nbriefs, they may do so, within the time restrictions fixed by the\nadministrative law judge. Each party shall serve a copy thereof on the other\nparty. The parties may also submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of\nlaw. The proposed findings of fact shall refer, wherever possible, to the\nrelevant pages of the transcript of hearing and exhibits. (7)\n\nThe hearing will be stenographically\nreported. A transcript thereof will be made available for examination at the\noffices of the Division of Tax Appeals in Albany, or may be purchased pursuant\nto section\n3000.19\nof this\n\nPart. If either party deems the transcript to be inaccurate in any material\nrespect, the party shall promptly notify the administrative law judge, setting\nforth specifically the alleged inaccuracies. The administrative law judge shall\nspecify the corrections to be made in the transcript, and such corrections\nshall be made a part of the record. (e) Determination. (1)\n\nIssuance of determination. The\nadministrative law judge shall review the evidence and render a determination\nwhich will contain findings of fact and conclusions of law. The administrative\nlaw judge will render a determination within six months after completion of the\nhearing or the submission of briefs, whichever is later. The administrative law\njudge may extend such six-month period, for good cause shown, to no more than\nan additional three months. The Division of Tax Appeals will serve a copy of\nthe determination on the petitioner, the petitioner's representative and the\noffice of counsel. (2)\n\nEffect of\ndetermination. The determination of the administrative law judge shall finally\ndecide the matters in controversy unless a party takes exception by timely\nrequesting review by the tribunal (see section\n3000.17\nof\nthis Part). Determinations of administrative law judges are not considered\nprecedent, nor are they given any force or effect in other proceedings in the\n\nDivision of Tax Appeals. (f) Assignment of another administrative law\njudge. Whenever an administrative law judge is disqualified, or it becomes\nimpractical for him or her to continue the hearing, another administrative law\njudge may be assigned to continue with the case, unless it is shown that\nsubstantial prejudice to a party will result therefrom.
