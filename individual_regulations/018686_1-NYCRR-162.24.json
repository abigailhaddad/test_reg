  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 162.24 - Pear standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. New York State Seal of Quality pears shall be pears of one variety\nwhich are mature, but not further advanced than firm ripe, carefully\nhand-picked, clean, fairly well formed, free from decay, internal breakdown, scald, freezing injury, worm holes, black end, free from injury by hard end, and from damage caused by bruises, broken skins, russeting, limbrubs, hail, scars, cork spot, drought spot, sunburn, sprayburn, stings or other insect\ninjury, disease, or mechanical or other means. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nSize means the greatest transverse\ndiameter of the pear taken at right angles to a line running from the stem to\nthe blossom end. (2)\n\nMature means\nthat the pear has reached the stage of maturity which will insure the proper\ncompletion of the ripening process. (i) Before\na mature pear becomes over-ripe it will show varying degrees of firmness\ndepending upon the stage of the ripening process. Therefore, a statement of\nfirmness should be given in order to indicate the stage of the ripening\nprocess. A description of the ground color should also be given. (ii)\n\nThe following terms should be used for\ndescribing the ground color: green, light green, yellowish green, and\nyellow. (iii)\n\nThe following terms\nshould be used for describing the firmness of pears. (a) Hard means that the flesh of the pear is\nsolid and does not yield appreciably even to considerable pressure. (b) Firm means that the flesh of the pear is\nfairly solid but yields somewhat to moderate pressure. (c) Firm-ripe means that the flesh of the\npear yields readily to moderate pressure. (d) Ripe means that the pear is at the stage\nwhere it is in its most desirable condition for eating. (3)\n\nOver-ripe means dead ripe, very mealy or soft, past commercial utility. (4)\n\nCarefully hand-picked means that the\npears do not show evidence of rough handling or of having been on the\nground. (5)\n\nFairly uniform means\nnot more than five percent of the pears in the container, vary more than 3/4\ninch in diameter. (6)\n\nClean means\nfree from excessive dirt, dust, spray residue or other foreign\nmaterial. (7)\n\nWell formed means\nhaving the shape characteristic of the variety. Slight irregularities of shape\nfrom type which do not appreciably detract from the general appearance of the\nfruit shall be considered well formed. (8)\n\nBlack end means an abnormally deep green\ncolor around the calyx, or black spots usually occurring on the one-third of\nthe surface nearest to the calyx, or by an abnormally shallow calyx\ncavity. (9)\n\nFairly well formed\nmeans that the pear may be slightly abnormal in shape but not to an extent\nwhich detracts materially from the appearance of the fruit. Winter Nelis pears\nwith characteristic slight sutures or with slight flattening on one side and/or\nother slight irregularities which do not materially detract from the general\nappearance of the pear shall be considered fairly well formed. (10)\n\nInjury by hard end means when causing\nmore than a slight protrusion at the blossom end. (11)\n\nDamage means any injury or defect which\nmaterially affects the appearance or the edible or shipping quality. (i) Hard end shall be considered as damage if\nthe pear shows an abnormally yellow color at the blossom end, or an abnormally\nsmooth rounded base with little or no depression at the calyx, of if the flesh\nnear the calyx is abnormally dry and tough or woody. (ii)\n\nSlight handling bruises and package\nbruises such as are incident to good commercial handling in the preparation of\na tight pack shall not be considered damage. (iii)\n\nAny pear with one skin break larger\nthan 3/16 inch in diameter or depth, or with more than one skin break\none-eighth inch or larger in diameter or depth shall be considered damaged, and\nscored against the grade tolerance. (a) Small\ninconspicuous skin breaks, less than 1/8 inch in diameter or depth, shall not\nbe considered damage. In addition, not more than 10 percent of the pears in any\ncontainer may have not more than one skin break from 1/8 inch to 3/16 inch, inclusive, in diameter or depth. (iv)\n\nRusseting which exceeds the following\nshall be considered as damage: (a) On all\nvarieties excessively rough russeting (russeting which shows \"frogging\" or\nslight cracking) when the aggregate area exceeds1/2 inch in diameter. (b) On bartlett and other smooth-skinned\nvarieties, slightly rough russeting, or thick russeting such as is\ncharacteristic of frost injury, when the aggregate area exceeds 3/4 inch in\ndiameter. (c) On bartlett and other\nsmooth-skinned varieties, smooth solid or smooth netlike russeting when\naggregate area exceeds 15 percent of the surface, except that, in addition, on\nsmooth-skinned varieties, any amount of characteristic smooth russeting shall\nbe permitted on that portion of the calyx end not visible for more than 1/2\ninch along the contour of the pear, when it is placed calyx end down on a flat\nsurface. (d) On bosc, rough or\nthick russeting such as is characteristic of frost injury, when the aggregate\narea exceeds 3/4 inch in diameter. Any amount of characteristic russeting is\npermitted whether due to natural causes such as weather or stimulated by\nartificial means; leaf whips or light limbrubs which resemble and blend into\nrusseted areas shall be considered as russet. (v) Any one of the following defects or any\ncombination thereof, the seriousness of which exceeds the maximum allowed for\nany one defect, shall be considered as damage: (a) Any limbrubs which are cracked, softened, or more than slightly depressed. (b) Black discoloration caused by limbrubs\nwhich exceeds an aggregate area of 3/8 inch in diameter. (c) Dark brown discoloration or excessive\nroughness caused by limbrubs which exceeds an aggregate area of 1/2 inch in\ndiameter. (d) Slightly rough, light\ncolored discoloration caused by limbrubs which exceeds an aggregate area of 3/4\ninch in diameter. (e) Smooth, light\ncolored discoloration caused by limbrubs which exceeds an aggregate area of one\ninch in diameter. (f) Hail marks or\nother similar depressions or scars which are not shallow or superficial, or\nwhere the injury affects an aggregate area of more than 3/8 inch in\ndiameter. (g) Cork spot when more\nthan one in number is visible externally or when the flesh is materially\naffected. (h) Drought spot when\nmore than one in number, or when the external injury exceeds an aggregate area\nof 3/8 inch in diameter or when the appearance of the flesh is materially\naffected by corky tissue or brownish discoloration. (i) Sunburn or sprayburn where the skin is\nblistered, cracked or shows any light tan or brownish color or the shape of the\npear is appreciably flattened, or the flesh appreciably softened or changed in\ncolor, except that sprayburn of a russet character shall be considered under\nthe definition of russeting. (j) Insects. (1)\n\nMore than two healed codling\nmoth stings, or any insect sting which is over 3/32 of an inch in diameter, or\nother insect stings affecting the appearance to an equal extent.
