  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 §§ 511-1.1 - Background and Intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Federal law\nrequires state Medicaid programs to offer Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment to all Medicaid-eligible children under age 21. Commonly referred to as \"EPSDT,\" these services are designed to support\nchildhood growth and development to ensure that children in low income families\nreceive the comprehensive and preventive health and behavioral health services\nthey need. EPSDT services include appropriate preventive, dental, health, behavioral health, developmental and specialty services. (b) Within the scope of EPSDT benefits under\nthe federal Medicaid law, states are required to cover any service that is\nmedically necessary \"to correct or ameliorate a defect, physical or mental\nillness, or a condition identified by screening\" and which are recommended by a\n\nLicensed Practitioner of the Healing Arts. Thus, EPSDT requires states not only\nto screen and diagnose health and mental health illnesses or conditions in low\nincome children, but they must ensure children are provided treatment as\nwell. (c) New York State has\nobtained an amendment to its Medicaid State Plan that authorizes the provision\nof six new children's behavioral health and health services under the EPSDT\nbenefit. When recommended by a Licensed Practitioner of the Healing Arts, these\nsix services will be made available to any child eligible for Medicaid who\nmeets relevant medical necessity criteria, and include: (1)\n\nCrisis Intervention Services: services\ndesigned to interrupt and/or ameliorate a behavioral health crisis through the\nprovision of support to an individual who may be experiencing a mental health\ncrisis, and subsequently connecting such individual to appropriate resources. For purposes of this Part, provision of this services does not connote\nexamination, diagnosis, care, treatment, rehabilitation, or training of a\nperson with mental illness and thus does not constitute a nonresidential\nservice requiring licensure under Mental Hygiene Law Section 31.02; (2)\n\nCommunity Psychiatric Supports &\nTreatment: interventions intended to achieve identified goals or objectives as\nset forth in a treatment/ recovery plan; (3)\n\nFamily Peer Support Services: formal and\ninformal services provided to families of a child experiencing social, emotional, developmental, medical, substance use, and/or behavioral challenges\nin their home, school, placement, and/or community; (4)\n\nYouth Peer Support and Training: formal\nand informal services and supports to ensure engagement and active\nparticipation of youth in the treatment planning and implementation\nprocess; (5)\n\nOther Licensed\n\nPractitioners: service provided by a non-physician behavioral health\npractitioner operating within a licensed children's mental health agency, who\nis licensed in New York and is operating within a scope of practice defined in\n\nNew York State law in any setting permissible under such law, including\ncommunity based settings; and\n(6)\n\nPsychosocial Rehabilitation Services: task-oriented services designed to\ncompensate for or eliminate functional deficits and interpersonal and/or\nbehavioral health barriers associated with behavioral health needs. (d) This Part is intended to\nestablish standards applicable to providers of mental health services licensed\nor operated by the Office of Mental Health that wish to be designated, or have\nbeen designated, as a provider of EPSDT, Other Licensed Practitioners, and\n\nCommunity Psychiatric Supports and Treatment Services. (e) This Part also establishes standards\napplicable to non-licensed providers of mental health services that receive\nfunding or have a contract from the Office that wish to be designated, or have\nbeen designated, as a provider of any of the following EPSDT services: Crisis\n\nIntervention Services, Family Peer Support Services, or Youth Peer Support and\n\nTraining and Psychosocial Rehabilitation Services.
