  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 197.7 - Depreciation accounting\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Computation and filing of depreciation rates. (1)\n\nEach utility shall determine and file\nwith this commission not later than six months following the date when it\nbecomes subject to this system of accounts, a statement showing composite\nannual percentage rates considered applicable to the book cost of each class of\ndepreciable property or subdivision thereof (see subdivision [c] of this\nsection) used wholly or partly in electric operations, which rates shall be\nbased upon the estimated service values and service lives developed by a study\nof the utility's history and experience, the history and experience of other\nutilities and electric corporations, and such engineering and other information\nas may be available in respect of probable future conditions. These percentage\nrates shall be computed in conformity with the group plan of accounting for\ndepreciation and shall be such that the loss in service value of the property\nwill be distributed in equal monthly charges during the service life of the\nproperty in accordance with the straight- line method (see §\n196.1, subd. [a][44]). When a\nclass of depreciable property covers two or more distinct types of property\nwith different service lives and/or net salvage values, the service lives and\nnet salvage values shall be separately determined for each such type of\nproperty. When this is done the composite annual rates shall be computed so as\nto produce a charge to operating expenses for each class of depreciable\nproperty which will be equal to the sum of the amounts chargeable for each of\nthe various types of depreciable property included in such class. The composite\nannual rates so filed shall be accompanied by a statement subscribed by the\nresponsible municipal official or other duly authorized representative of the\nutility showing the bases therefor and the methods employed in their\ncomputation, including the estimated service life and net salvage value at\nretirement of each class, or subdivision thereof, of depreciable property, and\nthe date when such rates become effective. The utility shall be prepared to\nsubmit evidence showing the correctness and applicability under the principles\nand methods herein prescribed of such rates, and to compute and submit at any\ntime, upon direction of this commission, revised rates when existing rates are\ndeemed inapplicable. (2)\n\nIf in the\njudgment of the utility any composite rate filed with the commission becomes no\nlonger currently applicable, the utility shall in like manner file revised\nannual composite depreciation rates which in its judgment should be\nestablished. (3)\n\nThe utility shall\nkeep such records of property and property retirements as will reflect the\nservice life of property which has been retired, or will permit the\ndetermination of probable service life by appropriate methods; and also such\nrecords as will reflect the percentage of salvage value, or net salvage value, as appropriate, for property retired from each class, or subdivision thereof, of depreciable operating property used wholly or partly in electric\noperations. (b) Depreciation charges. (1)\n\nCharges for\ncurrently accruing depreciation on Operating Property--Electric shall be made\nmonthly to the various operating expense accounts provided for such charges, to\nclearing accounts, or to account 432, Deductions from Rent Revenues--Electric\n(see paragraph [3] hereunder), with concurrent credits to account 261, Depreciation Reserves. Charges for Operating Property--General (used partly in\nelectric operations) shall be apportioned among the depreciation expense\naccounts or clearing accounts provided for electric operations and the\ncorresponding accounts for other operations (see §\n196.1. subd. [a] [32]). In\ncomputing the monthly charges, one-twelfth of the composite annual rate\napplicable to each class of depreciable operating property (see subd. [c]\nhereunder) shall be applied to the balance at the beginning of the month in\neach account or subdivision thereof covering such depreciable operating\nproperty. (2)\n\nDepreciation charges\nshall be made upon property used but not owned only to the extent that the cost\nof such property is included in the operating property accounts (see §\n197.17, subd. [a]) and shall be\nmade upon the same basis as for owned depreciable property. Any additional\nreserve required to meet losses expected to be incurred through reversion of\nsuch property to the lessor prior to the expiration of its service life shall\nbe provided through charges to account 790, Amortization of Intangible\n\nProperty, and credits to account 262, Amortization Reserves. For treatment of\ndepreciation upon leased property, see subdivision (d) of section\n197.28. (3)\n\nDepreciation charges on electric property\nconstituting a distinct operating unit leased to others for electric\noperations, when the lessee has exclusive possession, shall be made to account\n432, Deductions from Rent Revenues-- Electric, with concurrent credits to\naccount 261, Depreciation Reserves. (4)\n\nIn computing depreciation charges, a\nseparate composite annual rate shall be used for each class, or subdivision\nthereof, of depreciable Operating Property--Electric and Operating\n\nProperty--General. Such composite rates shall be those filed in accordance with\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (a) of this section, unless otherwise\nordered by the commission. Until the filing of such rates, each utility shall\nuse such provisional composite rates as will in its judgment approximate as\nclosely as is reasonably possible the rates to be filed. (c) Classes of depreciable electric operating\nproperty. (1)\n\nThe classes of depreciable\nelectric operating property, upon which composite depreciation rate shall be\nbased, and the accounts covering such operating property are as follows: Steam Power Plant Land[FN*] and all in account 312, Structures, into one class. [account 311(1)]\nHydro-Electric Power Plant Land* [account 311(2)]\nInternal Combustion Power Plant Land* [account\n311(3)]\nTransmission System Land and Rights of Way* [account\n311(5)]\nDistribution System Land and Rights of Way* [account\n311(6)]\nOffice Land* [account 311(7)]\nShop Land* [account 311(8)]\nStores Land* [account 311(9)]\nTransportation Land* [account 311(10)]\nMiscellaneous Land* [account 311(11)]\nSteam Power Plant Structures [account 312(1)]\nHydro-Electric Power Plant Structures [account\n312(2)]\nInternal Combustion Power Plant Structures [account\n312(3)]\nTransmission System Structures [account 312(5)]\nDistribution System Structures [account 312(6)]\nOffice Structures [account 312(7)]\nShop Structures [account 312(8)]\nStores Structures [account 312(9)]\nTransportation Structures [account 312(10)]\nMiscellaneous Structures [account 312(11)]\nBoiler Plant Equipment (account 321)\n\nEngine Driven Generator Units--Steam (account 322)\n\nTurbo-Generators--Steam (account 323)\n\nAccessory Electric Equipment--Steam (account 324)\n\nMiscellaneous Power Plant Equipment--Steam (account\n325)\n\nReservoirs, Dams, and Waterways (account 331)\n\nRoads, Trails, and Bridges (account 332)\n\nWater Wheels, Turbines, and Generators (account\n333)\n\nAccessory Electric Equipment--Hydro (account 334)\n\nMiscellaneous Power Plant Equipment--Hydro (account\n335)\n\nEngine Driven Generator Units--Internal Combustion\n(account 342)\n\nAccessory Electric Equipment--Internal Combustion\n(account 344)\n\nMiscellaneous Power Plant Equipment--Internal Combustion\n(account 345)\n\nTransmission Roads and Trails (account 351)\n\nTransmission Substation Equipment (account 352)\n\nTransmission Overhead Conductors (account 353)\n\nTransmission Underground Conductor (account 354)\n\nPoles, Towers, and Fixtures (account 358)\n\nUnderground Conduits (account 359)\n\nDistribution Substation Equipment (account 361)\n\nStorage Battery Equipment (account 362)\n\nDistribution Overhead Conductors (account 363)\n\nDistribution Underground Conductors (account 364)\n\nLine Transformers (account 365)\n\nOverhead Services (account 366)\n\nUnderground Services (account 367)\n\nConsumers' Meters (account 368)\n\nConsumers' Meter Installation (account 369)\n\nOther Property on Consumers' Premises (account\n370)\n\nStreet Lighting and Signal System Equipment[FN**]\n(account 371)\n\nOffice Equipment (account 381)\n\nStores Equipment (account 382)\n\nShop Equipment (account 383)\n\nTransportation Equipment (account 384)\n\nCommunication Equipment (account 385)\n\nLaboratory Equipment (account 386)\n\nGeneral Tools and Implements (account 387)\n\nMiscellaneous General Equipment (account 388)\n\nMiscellaneous Tangible Property (account 391)\n(2)\n\nIn case the utility carries\nany operating property in account 392, Undistributed Operating Property, the\ndepreciation provisions herein set forth shall apply thereto. The depreciation\ncharges for such property shall be made to the same accounts as if it were\ndistributed among the operating property accounts appropriate to its character\nand use. (d) Depreciation of other than electric property. (1)\n\nThe instructions for depreciation of\noperating property as outlined herein shall apply to Operating\n\nProperty--Electric and to Operating Property--General.
