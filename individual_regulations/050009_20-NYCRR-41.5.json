  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 41.5 - Computation of the property factor\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The percentage age of the taxpayer's real\nproperty, tangible personal property and intangible assets within New York\n\nState used in connection with interstate and/or foreign transmission services\nis determined by dividing the average value of such property within New York\n\nState by the average value of all such property within and without New York\n\nState. Such property should be included only for the period covered by the\nreturn. In determining this percentage, real property and tangible personal\nproperty shall include real property and tangible personal property owned by\nthe taxpayer, and real property and tangible personal property rented to the\ntaxpayer. (b) For purposes of the\nproperty factor, value means the cost of such property or assets without\nallowance for depreciation or amortization. After determining the cost of the\nreal property, tangible personal property and intangible assets, the average\nvalue of such property and assets is computed on a quarterly basis. At the\noption of the taxpayer, a more frequent basis such as monthly, weekly or daily\nmay be used. The average value of real property and tangible personal property\nrented to the taxpayer must be determined in accordance with the provisions of\nsection\n41.6\nof this Part. The same method of valuation must be used consistently with\nrespect to property within and without New York State. (c) A proportionate part of extraterrestrial\nproperty, such as communications satellites, used in connection with interstate\nand/or foreign transmission services is deemed to be located within New York\n\nState. The proportionate part of the taxpayer's extraterrestrial property\nwithin New York State used in connection with interstate and/or foreign\ntransmission services is determined by: (1)\nascertaining the average value of satellite repeater facilities, earth\nstations, or other satellite communications facilities within New York State\nused in connection with interstate and/or foreign transmission\nservices; (2)\nascertaining the\naverage value of satellite repeater facilities, earth stations, or other\nsatellite communications facilities within and without New York State used in\nconnection with interstate and/or foreign transmission services; (3)\ndividing the sum computed in paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision by the sum computed in paragraph (2); and\n(4)\nmultiplying the quotient computed in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision by the average value of all extraterrestrial\nproperty within and without New York State. (d) Real property and tangible personal\nproperty, other than extraterrestrial property, shall be determined to be\nlocated within or without New York State on the basis of the location of the\nreal property and tangible personal property owned or rented. Tangible personal\nproperty of the taxpayer is considered to be within New York State if and so\nlong as it is physically situated or located in New York State, even though it\nmay be stored in a bonded warehouse. Property of the taxpayer held in New York\n\nState by an agent, consignee or factor is considered to be situated or located\nwithin New York State. Property in transit between locations of the taxpayer is\nconsidered to be at its destination for purposes of the property factor. Property in transit between a buyer and a seller which is included by a\ntaxpayer in the denominator of its property factor in accordance with its\nregular accounting practices is included in the numerator of its property\nfactor if its destination is New York State. Intangible assets shall be deemed\nto be within or without New York State by allocating such intangible assets to\nthe commercial domicile of the taxpayer. (e) The term tangible personal property means\ncorporeal personal property, such as machinery, tools, implements, goods, wares\nand merchandise. It does not mean money, deposits in bank, shares of stock, bonds, notes, credits or evidences of any interest in property and evidence of\ndebt. Intangible assets include, but are not limited to, such items as patents, franchises and copyrights. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
