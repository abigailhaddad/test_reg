  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.12 - Matching of revenue and expenses\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1320 ]\n(a) Determination of the net income of an\naccounting period requires measurements of revenue, revenue deductions and\nexpenses associated with the period. Hospital revenue must be recorded in the\nperiod in which it is earned; that is, in the time period during which the\nservices are rendered to patients and a legal claim arises for the value of the\nservices. (b) Once the revenue\ndetermination is made, a measurement must be made of the amount of expense\nincurred in rendering the services on which the revenue determination was\nbased. Unless there is such a matching of revenue and expense, the reported net\nincome of a period is meaningless. (c) The requirement that revenue deductions\nmust also be matched properly against the gross revenues of the reporting\nperiod is sometimes overlooked. During the reporting period, patients' accounts\nreceivable will be debited and revenue accounts will be credited, at the\nhospital's full established rates, for all services rendered to patients. Some\nof these accounts receivable will remain unpaid at the end of the reporting\nperiod. A majority of these accounts will be collected in cash from the\npatients or from their third-party payors, but the remainder eventually will be\nwritten off as deductions from revenue. (d) It is important that these revenue\ndeductions be given accounting recognition in the same period that the related\nrevenues were recorded, even though certain of these revenue deductions cannot\nbe precisely determined. (e) Revenue and expenses are to be matched not only for the hospital as a whole, but also for each cost center. The cost center is an accounting device for\naccumulating items of cost or revenue that have common characteristics. A cost\ncenter may or may not be a department within the hospital. A cost center such\nas depreciation is an example where the cost center would not be a department\nof the hospital. The costs of the functions and activities included in each\ncost center description are to be included in the cost center. Revenue relative\nto such functions and activities must be included in the matching revenue\ncenter. For example, expenses related to the clinical laboratory functions\n(activities) are included in the Laboratory Services - Clinical cost center\n(account 7210) and related revenue are to be included in Laboratory Services\n-Clinical revenue center (account 4210). (f) Some hospitals record revenue on an\nall-inclusive rate basis (a rate based on type of accommodation regardless of\nthe utilization of ancillary services). Utilization of an inclusive rate system\nresults only in a modification of the patient billing and revenue accounting\nsystem. It does not eliminate the need to report expenses in the proper cost\ncenter. Those institutions which record charges on an all-inclusive rate basis\nare not required to report gross patient revenue for each patient care services\nrevenue center. An all-inclusive rate charging system is where the hospital's\ntotal charges consist of a rate based on type of accommodation multiplied by\nlength of stay regardless of the utilization of ancillary services.
