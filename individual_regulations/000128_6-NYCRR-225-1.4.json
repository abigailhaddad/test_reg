Fuels with sulfur content greater than\nthat allowed by this Subpart may be fired when the facility owner can\ndemonstrate that sulfur dioxide emissions do not exceed the value for S\ncalculated using the following equation: S = (1.1AM + 2BT)/(M + T)\nwhere: S = Allowable sulfur dioxide emission (in pounds per\nmillion Btu)\nA = Sulfur in oil allowed by Section\n225-1.2\nof this Subpart (in percent\nby weight)\nB = Average sulfur in solid fuel allowed by Section\n225-1.2\nof this Subpart (in pounds\nof sulfur per million Btu gross heat content)\nM = Percent of total heat input from liquid fuel\nincluding waste oil\nT = Percent of total heat input from solid fuel\n(including coal, coke, wood, wood waste, and refuse-derived fuel)\n\nFuel mixtures and equivalent emission rate variances only\napply to processes or stationary combustion installations. Compliance will be\nbased on the total heat input from all fuels fired, including gaseous fuels and\nwaste oil. Any process or stationary combustion installation owner who chooses\nto fire a fuel mixture pursuant to this Subdivision is subject to the emission\nand fuel monitoring requirements of Section\n225-1.5\nof this Subpart. (b) Experiments variance. Upon\napplication, the department may issue a variance allowing the sale, offering\nfor sale, purchase and firing of fuel having a sulfur content in excess of the\nlimits imposed by this Subpart, where such fuel would be fired to demonstrate\nthe performance of experimental equipment and/or process(es) for reducing\nsulfur compounds from an emission source. (c) Coal and coke. In New York City and\n\nNassau, Rockland and Westchester Counties, the commissioner will permit the\nsale and the continued, but not increased, purchase and use of coal and coke\nfor installations with a maximum operating heat input equal to or less than one\nmillion Btu per hour if coal and coke has been used continuously since December\n31, 1967 and the maximum sulfur content does not exceed 0.6 pound per million\n\nBtu gross heat content.
