  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 1903.2 - Procedures for the operation of continuous temporary release programs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Transfer. (1)\n\nAn inmate may not be\ntransferred to another correctional facility for continuous temporary release programming unless his care has\nfirst been approved for such programming by the director of temporary release programs. Under no\ncircumstances shall the director of classification and movement issue transfer orders to have inmates\ntransferred to another correctional facility for continuous temporary release programming unless that inmate\nhas first been approved for such programming by the director of temporary release programs. (2)\n\nAny inmate transferred to a facility, who is approved for participation\nin a continuous temporary release program at the receiving facility, will have his release clothing issued at\nthe transferring facility. That facility will send the clothing to the receiving facility on the same bus\nwith the inmate and his other property. (3)\n\nPrior to allowing an\ninmate to be transferred, the transferring facility's temporary release committee chairperson must check the\ninmate's record to ascertain whether or not any changes in the inmate's record would cause recision of\napproval as outlined in section\n1901.1\n(d) of this Title. (b) Orientation. (1)\n\nAs soon as possible after arrival at a correctional facility for\ncontinuous temporary release programming, each inmate shall be individually interviewed by a correction\ncounselor and a temporary release parole officer. These interviews shall include the following: (i) a clarification of the inmate's objectives in his continuous temporary\nrelease program and a compilation of his past employment and/or educational history; (ii)\nan identification of the inmate's problem areas, and plans for dealing\nwith them; (iii)\ninitial explanation of the program rules and\nexpectations; (iv)\ninitial preparation of a time schedule and a\nfinancial plan for the inmate; (v) a description of the\ncorrection counselor's responsibility for initial in-house preparation for continuous temporary release\nprogramming; and\n(vi)\na description of the temporary release\nparole officer's field responsibilities, including home and job visits. (2)\n\nAs soon a possible upon entry into any correctional facility where an\ninmate has been transferred in order to take part in a continuous temporary release program, the inmate shall\nparticipate in an orientation program which shall introduce the inmate to the facility and the program. This\norientation shall include: (i) a tour of the facility; (ii)\nan explanation of the in-house maintenance programs, including the\nin-house work assignments which the inmate will be required to perform; (iii)\na detailed explanation of the facility rules as well as the rules of\nthe temporary release program; (iv)\nan explanation of the job\ndevelopment, alcohol counseling, narcotic drug counseling, and mental health counseling services which, if in\noperation, are available to the inmates; (v) scheduling of\nfurther meetings with the correction counselor and temporary release parole officer staff; (vi)\nexplanations of facility financial processing procedures for the\ndisbursement of inmate funds, advances of funds in special situations, and the surrender of pay checks and\nother monies to the facility processing officer upon the inmate's return to the facility each day as\nspecified in more detail in this section. Those who conduct the orientation shall emphasize to the\norientation group of inmates that failure to turn in pay checks and other monies which have come into the\ninmate's control shall be considered a serious violation of the rules of the temporary release program, and\nmay result in the inmate's removal from such programming; (vii)\ninmates shall be advised that they should try to have available in their inmate account sufficient funds to\ncover incidental expenses during job search furlough beyond that specified in subdivision (f) of this\nsection; (viii)\ninmates shall be advised that during the\norientation period they will continue to earn an incentive wage allowance at step 2, grade II, and should be\nadvised to budget some portion of these funds for incidental job search expenses described above; (ix)\ninmates who have no funds in their inmate account upon arrival in\nprogram may be granted financial advances from the facility's business office to cover the incidental\nexpenses connected with their job search furloughs on their initial furloughs provided the chairperson of the\nfacility's temporary release committee and/or facility's superintendent has reason to believe that these\nfunds will be repaid by the inmate once he begins receiving wages from his employment. Once these funds are\nactually disbursed to the inmate, the temporary release committee chairperson, in coordination with the\nfacility's counseling, parole and business office staff, shall be responsible to see to it that these funds\nare repaid once the inmate is in a financial position to repay them. The refusal of an inmate to repay funds\nwhich were advanced to him, provided that the inmate is actually able to repay them, shall be an indication\nthat the inmate is too untrustworthy a person to continue in his program of temporary release, and may be\ngrounds for removing the inmate from program; (x) explanation of\nthe furlough eligibility requirements and furlough scheduling; (xi)\nactual preparation for job search furlough, work release, or\neducational release by the facility's correction counselor or temporary release parole officer's staff, and\nthe completion of the inmate's temporary release memo of agreement which the preparer shall make certain has\nbeen signed by the inmate; and\n(xii)\nnotification to local\nenforcement officers (form 4186 [TRP-8]) shall be sent out once indicating that the inmate is a continuous\ntemporary participant. This will be done five working days to commencement of furlough/work release or\ncommunity service leave. (c) Processing\nprocedures. (1)\n\nAll inmates who are confined in facilities which are\nexclusively continuous temporary release facilities shall leave and return to the facility through the\nprocessing room. However, general confinement facilities which have only a small number of inmates\nparticipating in continuous temporary release programs may modify these procedures to meet their unique\nneeds. Notice of these processing procedures shall be filed with the director of temporary release\nprograms. (2)\n\nAll inmates in continuous temporary release\nprograms shall be assigned a numbered processing room locker, and shall be given a lock to protect their\nclothing and personal belongings. The facility may demand financial reimbursement for the lock which is\nprovided to the inmate. The inmate will hold one of the two keys to the lock, while the second key will be\nsealed in an envelope, and kept in a locked, secure place in the facility. The inmate's locker may be opened\nat any time by the facility's superintendent or his designee. (3)\n\nFacilities are encouraged to provide small lock boxes to the inmates participating in continuous temporary\nrelease programs in which they will keep their weekly allowance. Again, the inmate will be given one of the\ntwo keys to the lock box, while the second key will be sealed in an envelope, and kept in a locked, secure\nplace in the facility. The contents of these lock boxes may be opened at any time by the facility's\nsuperintendent or his designee. However, a written notice must be filed in the inmate's case folder that this\nwas done. (4)\n\nWhere the facility does not provide the continuous\ntemporary release participant with a lock box for the inmate to secure his weekly allowance, the inmate will\nbe given an envelope containing his funds each morning prior to leaving the facility, and must sign a receipt\nfor receiving these funds. Further, upon his return to the facility, the inmate will turn in all of his funds\nto the processing room officer, and shall receive a receipt from the processing room officer documenting the\namount of money which was turned in. This receipt should be signed by both the inmate and the processing room\nofficer. (5)\n\nNo inmate shall be permitted to even enter the\nprocessing room unless the processing office has in his possession a temporary release program memo of\nagreement and a temporary release program inmate identification card. The facility's superintendent shall\ndesignate a correction counselor, temporary release parole officer, or correction officer who shall have the\nresponsibility to deliver memos of agreement and identification cards to the processing room, and this same\nperson shall be responsible to see to it that the memo of agreement and identification cards are removed from\nthe processing area and placed in the inmate's case file in the event that the inmate is placed on\nrestriction. (6)\n\nThe employee who is delegated by the\nsuperintendent with the responsibility to deliver and remove the memo of agreement and identification cards\nto the processing room shall not deliver any memos of agreement unless they have been signed by the inmate, and shall be held responsible if an inmate leaves a correctional facility without having signed a memo of\nagreement. (7)\n\nThe superintendent shall designate an employee in\nthe facility's business or fiscal office to be responsible for delivering to the processing room the inmate's\ndaily or weekly funds which are to be distributed by the officers in the processing room. (8)\n\nIn accordance with section 856.1  of the Correction Law, each inmate\nleaving a correctional facility in order \"to participate in a temporary release program shall have on his or\nher person, a temporary release identification card identifying him or her as a participant in a temporary\nrelease program as signed by the superintendent of the institution, and shall exhibit such card to any peace\nofficer upon request of the officer.\" The superintendent shall designate an employee to be responsible for\nthe preparation of this card. (i) All information required on the card is\nto be completed. Note that the section marked \"effective date _____ to _____\" shall be completed so that the\nfirst date of the inmate's participation in program shall appear in the left hand blank space and right hand\nblank space may remain uncompleted. (ii)\n\nThe temporary release\nidentification card shall be given to the inmate as soon as possible after his reception in a continuous\ntemporary release program. If the facility permits, he may keep it on his person for identification purposes\nin the facility and must carry it while he is outside of the facility. (iii)\n[Reserved]\n(iv)\n\nThe loss\nof a temporary release identification card shall be deemed as an act of misconduct for which the inmate\nshould be written up and taken through at least minimal disciplinary proceedings which would require\nreimbursement to the facility for the expense of issuing a new temporary release identification\ncard. (v) When a continuous temporary release participant is\nparoled, conditionally released, transferred to another correctional facility, or moved from his temporary\nrelease program, it is the responsibility of the chairperson of the temporary release committee to confiscate\nthe inmate's temporary release identification card from the inmate, and see to it that the card is\ndestroyed. (9)\n\nPrior to the inmate's actual release\nfrom the processing room, the processing officer shall make certain that the inmate has in his possession a\nsigned temporary release identification card and sufficient travel money to get him to the destination\nindicated on his memo of agreement and back to the facility. The processing officer is also responsible to\nsee to it that no restriction order has been placed against the inmate. In the event that the inmate's papers\nare not in order or a restriction is in effect, the processing room officer shall advise the watch commander, and the chairperson of the temporary release committee by telephone, and shall refer the inmate to the\nfacility's staff member who can clarify or correct the unusual situation. Under no circumstances shall the\nprocessing room officer permit an inmate whose status in his temporary release program is in question to wait\nfor clarification of his situation in the processing room area. (10)\n\nThe inmate will change from his institutional clothing to his civilian\nclothing prior to leaving the facility, and will lock his institutional clothing in his locker. (11)\n\nAfter a visual inspection by the processing officer, the inmate will\ngo to the officer's desk area where he will be issued funds which were previously authorized by the program\nstaff. The inmate will sign a receipt for monies received. (12)\n\nUpon this return to the facility from temporary release, the inmate will empty his belongings into the\nappropriate receptacle at the entrance door and then proceed through a metal detector, if the facility has\none, into the processing room. (13)\n\nAll money and tokens not used\nby the inmate when he was out of the facility will be either deposited in the inmate's lock box under the\nprocessing officer's supervision, or will be turned in to the officer. The officer will record the amount of\nmoney deposited in the lock box, or will give the inmate a receipt for money turned in to him. Under no\ncircumstances shall continuous temporary release participants be permitted to take money, tokens, or other\nfunds into the other parts of the facility. (14)\n\nWhen the\nprocessing officer takes note than an inmate has returned to the facility with money in excess of what the\ninmate has been expected to bring back, the processing officer will either telephone the temporary release\ncommittee chairperson, correction counselor, or temporary release parole officer (depending upon who he was\ndirected to contact by the superintendent). Immediately thereafter, an investigation shall be conducted into\nthe source of these funds. If the inmate cannot offer an acceptable explanation for the source of these\nfunds, he shall be placed on restriction, and referred to the temporary release committee for program\nevaluation. (15)\n\nThe inmate will remove his civilian clothing and\nbe subject to an appropriate search as determined by the facility's superintendent. If the superintendent so\ndirects, on an individual basis, the inmate may be directed to submit to a search of his or her internal body\ncavities. (16)\n\nAfter the inmate has been searched and cleared by\nthe processing officer, the officer shall verify the inmate's return time in the processing log book. The\ninmate will afterwards dress into his institutional clothing, and proceed to the residence area of the\nfacility. (d) Employment procurement. (1)\n\nEmployment program. (i) No work\nrelease participant may be employed by or with a co-defendant unless specific permission is granted by the\ndirector of temporary release programs in writing. (ii)\n\nNo work\nrelease participant may work at the scene of his crime, nor may he be employed by the same company if his\ncrime was related in any way to his employment, unless specific permission is granted by the director of\ntemporary release programs in writing. (iii)\n\nIf a work release\nparticipant obtains employment which requires him to move about within a specific geographical area, he must\nsupply an itinerary to his work release parole officer and also a phone number(s) where he can be\ncontacted. (iv)\n\nThe temporary release committee, with the\nconcurrence of the superintendent, has the authority to disapprove an employment program when, in their\njudgment, the inmate will have too great an opportunity to return to the same type of crime. (v) Self-employment of continuous temporary release participants. Because\nof the extra demands which self-employment places upon employed people and because of the high level of\nmaturity which is required in order to successfully compete in the labor force as a self-employed person, continuous temporary release participants must receive the approval of the temporary release committee, superintendent, and the director of temporary release programs before they may become self-employed while\nparticipating in a continuous temporary release program. Generally speaking, the director of the temporary\nrelease program will only approve continuous temporary release participants to become self-employed if these\ninmates were successfully self-employed before they were received in the correctional system and then only if\nthe inmate displays a higher than average level of emotional maturity. In those cases where approval is\ngranted, it will be contingent upon the inmate's compliance with any applicable laws and licensing\nprocedures. (2)\n\nWork search. (i) Inmates who have been approved to participate in a work release program\nand who are unemployed may be granted job search furloughs. (ii)\n\nGenerally speaking, inmates who have been approved to participate in a work release program and are\nunemployed will be granted work search furloughs. On the inmate's day when he remains in the facility, the\ninmate will be interviewed by a correction counselor or temporary release parole officer, his/her activities\nof the previous day will be evaluated, job leads for the next day will be developed, and a new form 4182.3, temporary release memo of agreement, will be prepared and signed by the inmate. The correction counselor or\ntemporary release parole officer, on a case-by-case basis and when possible considering time factors, shall\nmake an effort to verify the inmate's previous day's job search efforts by telephone calls to the places\nwhere the inmate went to search for employment, and shall also make an effort to verify in advance any\nemployment interviews which the inmate has scheduled. (iii)\n\nIf an\ninmate requests an extension of time on his job search furlough, he must immediately contact the correction\ncounselor or temporary release parole officer who granted him the furlough, or in his absence the chairperson\nof the temporary release committee, or in his absence the superintendent, and request such an extension. Extensions of time may be granted only if the inmate has scheduled another verifiable employment interview, and the person who grants such an extension shall make an effort to verify the inmate's employment interview. Extensions of job search furloughs generally should not be for more than two hours. (iv)\n\nUpon his return to the facility from a job search furlough, the inmate\nshould, previously required by his correction counselor or temporary release parole officer, be able to\nprovide the facility with a list of employers' names and addresses where he went during the day to attend\nemployment interviews, or to search for employment. The inmate should also be able to account for the time\nspent at each prospective employment address and for transportation time between these prospective employment\naddresses. The refusal or failure of an inmate to account for his time spent searching for employment as\ndescribed above, when the inmate has been previously required to do so, or the discovery that the inmate has\nbeen making false reports to the facility staff about his activities while on a job search furlough, may be\nconsidered an indication that the inmate is too untrustworthy and/or too unmotivated a person to continue in\ncontinuous temporary release programming, and may be grounds for the inmate's removal from the\nprogram. (v) If an inmate has failed to secure employment three\nweeks after completion of orientation, the temporary release counselor should hold an interview with the\ninmate and review his efforts towards obtaining employment and counsel the inmate concerning attitude and\nmotivation. (vi)\n\nIf an inmate has still not secured employment\nsix weeks after completion of orientation, the temporary release counselor must refer the case to the\ntemporary release committee for review. At this point the temporary release committee may remove the inmate\nfrom the program if they decide that the inmate is either unwilling or unable to obtain employment. (e) Procedures following procurement of a work\nrelease, educational release or other continuous temporary release program. (1)\n\nInmates are to be advised that their employers or schools must be told\nof their status as inmates serving sentences in a correctional facility, and the inmates should be encouraged\nto notify their employers or schools about their status as inmates (in the event that the employer or school\nis not already aware of this fact). (2)\n\nWhen an inmate returns to\na correctional facility and has secured employment or made arrangements to begin an educational release\nprogram, the correction counselor or temporary release parole officer, depending upon who has been assigned\nthis responsibility by the chairperson of the temporary release committee or superintendent, if there is not\nalready some documentation in the inmate's case folder that the employer or school is already aware of his\ninmate's status, shall telephone the employer of school and make certain that the inmate's immediate\nemployment supervisor, or the dean of academic affairs, or some other official in the school management, is\nfully aware of the inmate's status. If requested, the correction counselor or temporary release parole\nofficer may give the employer or school the name of the type of crime for which the inmate was convicted, the\nsentence which he received, the date that the inmate will be eligible for parole and conditional release, and\nthe inmate's maximum expiration date. Under no circumstances shall any correction counselor or temporary\nrelease parole officer give the employer or school, or for that matter any outside agency, any information\nwhatsoever about the inmate's use of illegal narcotic drugs, excessive use of alcohol, mental health status, or physical health status without first obtaining a written statement from the inmate authorizing the\ndepartment to release such information. (3)\n\nAfter verifying that\nthe employer or school is aware that the inmate is currently serving a sentence in a correctional facility, the correction counselor or parole officer shall obtain information concerning the inmate's work hours, place\nof employment and other information needed to complete the inmate's form 4182.2, continuous temporary release\nmemo of agreement, and will inform the employer or school about the monitoring activities by the temporary\nrelease parole officer especially of the temporary release parole officer's requirements to make a positive\non-site employment visit once a month. (4)\nA form 4182.2, continuous temporary release memo of agreement, will then be prepared, and shall be signed by the inmate. The\nmemo of agreement will include the employer's (or education institution's) name, address, and telephone\nnumber, the inmate's extended bounds of confinement (the most direct route to and from work or school), the\nsalary of stipend which the inmate will earn or receive, and the hours that the inmate is to be out of the\nfacility. The hours of release are to be computed according to the following formula: (i) the hours of work or school, plus; (ii)\nthe basic travel time to and from work or school, plus; (iii)\none-half the basic travel time (the total travel time should never be\nless than one half hour). (5)\n\nAt the bottom of the\ninmate's form 4182.2, temporary release memo of agreement, the preparer shall indicate that there is already\ndocumentation in the inmate's case file that the employer or school is aware that the subject is an inmate, or that on the given date the correction counselor or temporary release parole officer advised the inmate's\nemployer or school (name of person advised should be given) about the inmate's status. (6)\n\nTime extensions. (i) An inmate's\nrequest for an extension of time on work or educational release or in any other continuous temporary release\nprogram may be approved by a correction counselor or temporary release parole officer, or in their absence\nthe chairperson of the temporary release committee, or in his absence by the superintendent, only for\novertime work or medical and dental appointments. (ii)\n\nRequests\nfor time extensions for medical or dental appointments, except in emergency situations, must be submitted by\nthe inmate to his correction counselor or temporary release parole officer 24 hours in advance of the\nappointment. These appointments should afterwards be verified by the staff member who authorized the\nextension of time. (iii)\n\nRequests for time extensions to work\novertime must be verified by the correction counselor or temporary release parole officer by means of a\ncontact with the inmate's employer before approval can be granted. (iv)\n\nUnder no circumstances shall an inmate be given any extension of time\nin any continuous temporary release program as enumerated in sections\n1903.1\nof this Part which would cause him to be in the community more than 14 hours in any given day. However, nothing herein shall be construed to preclude an inmate who is participating in any continuous temporary\nrelease program from also receiving a furlough which would otherwise permit him to be in the community for\nmore than 14 hours in any given day. (7)\n\nIf the\ninmate's release from the facility is required for some purpose which is not covered by the inmate's form\n4182.2, continuous temporary release memo of agreement, a separate form 4182.1, temporary release memo of\nagreement, must be prepared and signed by the inmate before he may be permitted to leave the facility. Correction counselors and temporary release parole officers, upon being authorized to do so by the\nchairperson of the temporary release committee or superintendent, may only grant such furloughs (usually on\nweekday evenings or weekends) for the following purposes: (i) for required\ncourt appearances upon verification; (ii)\nfor medical or dental\nservices upon verification; (iii)\nfor attending A.A., substance\nabuse counseling, gamblers anonymous, or mental health counseling upon verification; (iv)\nfor taking part in community service activities upon verification and\nalso upon receiving the approval of the facility's temporary release committee and superintendent to take\npart in such community service activities; (v) for personal and\nfamily emergencies upon verification; (vi)\nfor doing laundry if\nthe facility's laundry equipment is inoperable; (vii)\nfor local\nshopping for necessities needed to successfully adjust in the inmate's continuous temporary release program\nprovided that he/she turns in receipts for purchases made to the facility employee who authorized the\ninmate's release; and\n(viii)\nfor other specific, verifiable\npurposes in keeping with section\n851\nof the Correction Law. (8)\n\nAll such requests for\nspecial furloughs must be submitted at least 24 hours in advance, except in cases of emergencies. (9)\n\nNo inmate is to be released from a correctional facility on a\ncontinuous community services leave program or continuous industrial training leave program unless a\ncompleted form 4182.2, continuous temporary release memo of agreement, has been prepared and signed by the\ninmate. (10)\n\nMotor vehicle licenses and ownership of motor\nvehicles. (i) Continuous temporary release participants who have motor\nvehicle licenses are not to be given their motor vehicle licenses while participating in continuous temporary\nrelease programs unless these inmates need them for employment purposes. If necessary for employment, the\ninmate must request and receive approval from the facility's temporary release committee. (ii)\n\nNo temporary release participant may apply for or renew any motor\nvehicle license without first receiving the written approval of his temporary release parole officer to do\nso. (iii)\n\nNo temporary release participant is to purchase, own, or operate, or have in his possession, any motor vehicle for his personal use without first receiving the\nwritten approval of the facility's temporary release committee, the superintendent, and the director of\ntemporary release programs. Generally speaking, continuous temporary release participants should only be\ngiven authorization to own or operate a motor vehicle for personal use when there is unsuitable public\ntransportation for the inmate to travel to and from his place of work, or when the inmate is in some way\nphysically handicapped. (f) Financial\nguidelines and procedures for continuous temporary release participants. The following financial procedures\nregarding inmates in continuous temporary release programs are to be followed at all times: (1)\n\nApproved conditions for appropriation advances. Continuous temporary\nrelease participants who do not have funds available for program participation may, but do not have to, be\ngranted advances from the facility's temporary release appropriation account for the following purposes only: (i) Work release and industrial training leave expenses. (a) Inmates on job search. An inmate on job search may receive an advance\nin an amount not to exceed $20 per day for all of his expenses, including meals and transportation costs not\nprovided by the facility. (b) Inmates employed on work release or\non industrial training leave who have not received their first paycheck. A facility superintendent may\nadvance an inmate on work release or industrial training leave who has not yet received his first paycheck a\nmaximum of $20 per day for all of his expenses, including meals and other expenses not provided by the\nfacility. The facility's superintendent may also advance funds to purchase necessary work clothing, tools\nneeded on the job, or other incidental expenses necessary for the inmate's successful participation in\nhis/her program of temporary release if in his/her judgment there is a substantial likelihood that these\nfunds will be reimbursed by the inmate. (ii)\n\nEducational release. (a) For tuition costs up to $500 each semester, where\nthe source of reimbursement is verified. All advanced money must be reimbursed. (b) For clothing costs up to $100 each semester, where the source of\nreimbursement is verified. (c) For books and school supplies up\nto $100 each semester, where the source of reimbursement is verified. (d) For transportation costs. (iii)\n\nFurloughs. For transportation costs up to $25 for one weekend\nfurlough if the inmate meets all of the other furlough criteria. All advanced money will be\nreimbursed. (iv)\n\nEmergency leave of absence. For transportation\ncosts, and, if the inmate has no relative or friend who has agreed to provide him with lodging and meals, funds to cover the cost of lodging and meals. All money advanced must be reimbursed. (2)\n\nBusiness or fiscal office responsibilities. (i) Accounting for advances. (a) Inmates, as a general rule, should only be granted financial advances when the facility's superintendent or the\nchairperson of the facility's temporary release committee feels that there is a substantial likelihood that\nthe funds to be advanced to the inmate will eventually be reimbursed. Once these funds are actually advanced\nto the inmate, the temporary release committee chairperson, in coordination with the facility's counseling, parole, and business office staff, shall be responsible to see to it that these funds are repaid once the\ninmate is in a financial position to repay them. The refusal of an inmate to repay funds which were advanced\nto him when the temporary release committee has concluded that he has the financial resources to repay them\nshall be grounds for removing the inmate from the program. (b) Funds will not be issued to any inmate from the facility's appropriated advance account until the business\noffice receives a written request from the inmate's correction counselor, temporary release parole officer, the temporary release committee chairperson, or the superintendent detailing the amount to be advanced and\nthe repayment schedule. Any requests for advances of more than $25 must be first approved by the\nsuperintendent. The business officer shall report to the temporary release committee\nchairperson any repeated or unusual requests for advances of funds which do not appear to conform to what is\nthought to be the facility's financial guidelines. (c) All\nfunds advanced to inmates will be recorded on form 2759, inmate account ledger. Funds will subsequently be\ndeducted from the inmate's account to repay the advances in accordance with the repayment schedule which was\npreviously agreed upon between the inmate and the correction counselor or temporary release parole officer\nand will be deposited into the respective program advance account. Proper entries will be made on the inmate\naccount ledger to reduce each inmate's advance balance. (d) In\nthose unusual incidents where funds advanced to an inmate become uncollectable, a voucher will be processed\nagainst the facility's appropriations to repay the advance account, and the procedure established by the\ndepartment shall be followed. (ii)\n\nInmate's personal\naccount. (a) Funds will not be issued to any inmate from an inmate's\npersonal account until a form IAS 2706, disbursement request has been completed, signed by the inmate, approved by the superintendents or his designee, and forwarded to the business office. (b) If an inmate does not have sufficient funds in his personal account, his request will be rejected and returned to the correction counselor or temporary release parole officer who\napproved the request. The correction counselor or temporary release parole officer will subsequently make a\ncasework decision whether funds should be requested from the facility's appropriation advance\naccount. (c) Once a continuous temporary release participant\nbegins to regularly participate in his program of temporary release, he must submit form IAS 2706, disbursement request, each week to obtain funds from his personal account for work release\nexpenses. (d) The business office shall report to the temporary\nrelease committee chairperson any requests for an unusually large amount of money or repeated requests for\nfunds which do not appear to conform to what is thought to be the facility's financial\nguidelines. (iii)\n\nReport preparation. (a) A monthly statement of each continuous temporary release participant's\naccount will be prepared by the business office and copies will be distributed to the inmate and his\ncorrection counselor or temporary release parole officer depending upon who the superintendent has designated\nto receive them. (b) The facility's steward shall prepare an\nannual report of financial operations in the continuous temporary release program to include total net\nearnings, total payment of fines, total payment of support of dependents, total savings accumulated, and\ntotal weeks of employment. This report will be submitted to the facility's superintendent and to the\nchairperson of the temporary release committee no later than January 5th of each year. The temporary release\ncommittee chairperson shall forward a copy of this report to the director of temporary release\nprograms. (3)\n\nDaily work release and\nindustrial training leave financial procedures. (i) Regular allowances. (a) Inmates assigned to a work release program will assume all expenses\nrelated to their participation in this program. (b) Once an\ninmate becomes employed, a weekly allowance will be established by agreement between the inmate and his\ncorrection counselor or temporary release parole officer, and an IAS 2706 disbursement request for the\nallowance will be prepared and turned into the business office. Upon receipt of the IAS 2706, the business\noffice will issue the funds which were authorized from the inmate's account on one regularly scheduled\nday each week. It will then be the inmate's responsibility to live within this financial allowance\nuntil the next regularly scheduled day when the business office issues inmate funds. (c) Unless the business office staff has been directed to do otherwise by\nthe inmate's correction counselor, temporary release parole officer, the temporary release committee\nchairperson, or the superintendent, the business office will issue the amount of funds which were requested\non the IAS 2706 on each of the regularly scheduled days when funds are issued. (d) Under no circumstances shall the business office draw funds from an\ninmate's personal account for any reason unless a signed and approved IAS 2706 has been\nreceived. (e) The business office will disburse all funds in\namounts under $5 in cash. will draw a check from the inmate funds account and handle in accordance with\nprescribed fiscal procedures. (ii)\n\nTransportation\ncosts. (a) Inmates will assume all costs related to their travel to and\nfrom work as well as to and from their weekend furlough address. (b) In those cases where transportation is provided by the facility, an\nappropriate charge to cover the cost of gasoline, oil, lubricants and other nonfixed costs of the\ntransporting vehicle may be assessed to each inmate who uses such transportation. These charges will be\nincluded in the inmate's requested weekly allowance, and must be approved by his correction counselor or\ntemporary release parole officer who is in charge of the IAS 2706 disbursement request. The business office, upon receipt of the inmate's signed IAS 2706 will draw a check from the inmate funds account and handle in\naccordance with prescribed fiscal procedures. (iii)\n\nInmate wages. (a) All inmates must turn in their earnings, or any other\nfunds which come under their control, to the facility's processing officer immediately upon their return to\nthe facility. All funds must be turned in to the processing officer in the form in which they were received\n(check or cash). Under no circumstances shall an inmate be allowed to cash a check received from an employer. An inmate may convert cash to a check form for receipt by the facility, but only with the prior permission of\nhis correction counselor or parole officer. When money is turned in, the processing officer will issue the\ninmate a receipt for the full amount. These funds will subsequently be delivered to the business office, and\nwill be deposited in the inmate's personal account. (b) The\nfailure of an inmate to turn in his earnings, or any other funds which come under his control, shall be\nconsidered a serious violation of the inmate's temporary release memo of agreement, and will make the inmate\nsubject to disciplinary action which may result in his removal from the program. The inmate's repeated\nfailure to turn in the full amount of his earnings or the full amount of any other funds which come under his\ncontrol should be considered an indication that the inmate is too untrustworthy, immature, and/or unmotivated\nto continue to participate in a continuous temporary release program, and this should be considered to be a\npresumption against the inmate continuing to participate in program. (c) The superintendent shall designate a facility employee the\nresponsibility for the preparation of a schedule one day each week which lists the names of all of the\nemployed continuous temporary release participants in the facility and the day of the week that these inmates\nshould receive their paychecks. This list will afterwards be delivered to the processing room officer who\nwill have the responsibility to notify the temporary release committee chairperson in the event that an\ninmate returns to the facility on the indicated day without his paycheck. (iv)\n\nWork release inmate's dependents receiving public assistance. (a) The superintendent shall designate a facility employee the\nresponsibility to review the case folder of every work release participant once he begins working, and\nattempt to determine whether or not the inmate's acknowledged and legal dependents are receiving public\nassistance. If the case folder is unclear whether or not the inmate's dependents are receiving public\nassistance, the designated employee shall contract (preferably by telephone) the Department of Social\n\nServices center which covers the address where the inmate's dependents reside, and determine whether or not\nthe inmate's dependents are receiving public assistance. Where the facility is far removed from the address\nof the inmate's dependents, the public assistance status of an inmate's dependents shall be determined by a\nletter to the Department of Social Services center in the area, a copy of which shall be filed in the\ninmate's facility folder. The designated employee will have the responsibility to follow-up to make certain\nthat the letter is answered. (b) When it is determined that an\ninmate's acknowledged or legal dependents are not receiving public assistance, the designated employee shall\nsign and place a form letter in the inmate's facility file to that effect. (c) When it is determined that an inmate's acknowledged or legal dependents\nare, in fact, receiving public assistance, the designated employee shall have the responsibility to complete\nand sign a form letter to the Department of Social Services office in question informing them of this fact. This form letter should indicate the inmate's name, departmental number, social security number, and the\nnames and addresses of his dependents who are receiving public assistance. The form letter should, likewise, give the name and address of the inmate's employer, the date when he began working, and the inmate's weekly\nearnings. If the inmate is contributing, or plans to contribute to, the support of his dependents, the\n\nDepartment of Social Services office shall be so advised. (d) When it is determined that the inmate's acknowledged or legal dependents are receiving public assistance, the\ndesignated employee shall report this information to the correction counselor or temporary release parole\nofficer who has the responsibility to approve the inmate's form IAS 2706, disbursement request. The\ncorrection counselor or temporary release parole officer will afterwards make contact with the inmate's\ndependents' caseworker at the Department of Social Services center, and a casework conference should be held\nto determine whether, or how much, an inmate should be required to contribute toward the support of his\ndependents. The correction counselor or temporary release parole officer shall assure that all future IAS\n2706, disbursement requests, reflect the required support payments. (e) Whenever possible, the facility will arrange for the business office to\ndeduce support payments from the inmate's personal account, and shall forward these funds directly to the\ninmate's family, the Family Court, or the Department of Social Services. (f) If a work release participant refuses to make financial payments toward\nthe support of this acknowledged or legal dependents, he is likely to be charged with the crime of\nnonsupport. His continued temporary release participation is, therefore, in jeopardy. The inmate is to be\nimmediately placed on restriction and referred to the temporary release committee for program\nevaulation. (4)\n\nEducational release expenses\nand financial procedures--regular allowances. (i) Inmates assigned to an\neducational release program will assume all expenses related to their participation in that\nprogram. (ii)\n\nInmates who enter the educational release program\nshall be cautioned that all funds which have been advanced to them, except funds for meals and their\nmiscellaneous daily allowance, are reimbursable to the Department of Correctional Services. Should the inmate\nobtain, or be expected to obtain, financial assistance for any outside source (e.g., G.I. bill, veteran's\nbenefits, Social Security, scholarships, family assistance) he or she will be required to reimburse the\n\nDepartment of Correctional Services for all funds which were advanced to them. (iii)\n\nInmates are to be instructed that they are not to apply for, or to\nreceive funding for, any kinds of educational release reimbursement without the knowledge of the facility's\ntemporary release committee chairperson. This includes all benefits from the Veterans Administration, Social\n\nSecurity, school stipends, or any other sources. (iv)\n\nThe\nsuperintendent shall delegate a correction counselor or temporary release parole officer the responsibility\nand authority to coordinate the educational release participant's application for, and utilization of, all\neducational release funding. The inmate shall be instructed that he is responsible to report all funds which\nhe receives for educational release purposes to this same correction counselor or temporary release parole\nofficer. (v) If an educational release participant receives any\nkind of financial aid which is not paid directly to the college or school, this stipend must be reported to\nthe facility, and placed in the inmate's personal account for the purpose of paying educational\nexpenses. (vi)\n\nIf it is discovered that an educational release\nparticipant has failed to report all funds received by him for educational purposes, he is to be immediately\nplaced on restriction and referred to the temporary release committee for program evaluation. (vii)\n\nEducational release participants are eligible for the following\nfunds: (a) A maximum of $20 per day for all expenses, including\ntransportation costs or meals not provided by the facility. Meal allowances are only for meals which the\ninmate is required to purchase while he is out of the facility. The facility must make every attempt to\nprovide the inmate with a breakfast before he leaves the facility and with a dinner after he returns to the\nfacility in the evening. (b) A miscellaneous allowance of $2 per\nschool day. (1)\n\nThe miscellaneous allowances of $2 per school day will only\nbe given for each day that an inmate attends class. The inmate is not given this allowance for any day that\nhe was held in the facility or was not in class. (2)\n\nThe\nmiscellaneous allowance is not to be considered an advance which the inmate must repay. Inmates may still be\nassigned to perform institutional duties during days on which they do not attend classes. (c) Advances for transportation costs if the facility does not\nprovide the inmate with transportation to and from school. (d) Advances for clothing costs, books and school supplies up to $200 each semester, where the source of\nreimbursement is verified. This advanced money must be reimbursed prior to the start of the next\nsemester. (e) Educational expenses for education release inmates\nare the responsibility of the college staff and the inmate. The college financial aid office or coordinator's\nstaff should initiate inquiries into the financial capabilities of the inmate's families and the inmate\nhimself 4-6 weeks before the start of the semester and final payment arrangements for the financial\nobligations must be completed before registration. Therefore, the Department of Correctional Services will\nidentify potential students to the college 6-8 weeks before the start of the semester. If neither personal\nfinancing nor other educational funding (i.e., TAP or BEOG) is available to an inmate, that inmate cannot\nenroll. (5)\n\nCommunity services leave\nfinancial procedures. (i) Inmates participating in the community services\nleave program will receive an allowance which is the equivalent to the highest incentive allowance granted to\nan inmate plus one dollar, and will be credited for this allowance each day they leave the facility to\nperform volunteer community service work. (ii)\n\nInmates\nparticipating in the community services leave program will also receive their transportation costs and the\nmeal allowances which were specified for the educational release participants in this subdivision, in the\nevent that the facility elects not to provide the inmate with transportation and a boxed lunch. (6)\n\nLeave of absence financial procedures. (i) Inmates leaving a correctional facility to make a death bed visit or to\nattend a funeral will assume all expenses connected with this type of leave. The inmate may request the\ndisbursement of money from his personal account to cover the costs of transportation, lodging, and meals when\nthese needs are not going to be met by a relative or friend, and up to $25 for incidental expenses. However, the money requested by the inmate for incidental expenses is subject to review by the inmate's correction\ncounselor or temporary release parole officer and by the superintendent. (ii)\n\nInmates leaving a correctional facility in order to receive medical or\ndental treatment which is not available in the New York State Department of Correctional Services system must\nassume the total financial responsibility for all medical and dental expenses incurred by them, except for\nthose medical and dental expenses which the Department of Correctional Services had contracted with the\ndoctor, dentist, hospital or clinic to provide for the inmate prior to his release from the institution on\nemergency leave of absence. (iii)\n\nAn inmate leaving the facility\non emergency medical leave of absence may request the same funds as were detailed in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision from his personal account. However, in those cases where the Department of Correctional Services\nhas contracted with a doctor, dentist, hospital or clinic to provide medical or dental services for a\ntemporary release participant, the department, itself, will assume the cost of all transportation, lodging\nand meals when the department has not already made arrangements for transportation, lodging and meals to be\nprovided to the inmate. (7)\n\nFurlough expenses. (i) Family tie, housing, job search furloughs. Continuous temporary release\nparticipants who are granted furloughs for the purpose of seeking employment, seeking post-release housing, or maintaining family ties must use their own funds to cover all expenses connected with such furlough\nparticipation. (ii)\n\nJob search furloughs. (a) If a work release approved inmate does not have sufficient funds in his\npersonal account to cover the expenses connected with searching for employment, the inmate's correction\ncounselor or temporary release parole officer, depending upon who has been assigned this duty by the\nsuperintendent, may authorize the business office to disburse funds to cover the cost of the inmate's\ntransportation, meals and telephone calls. (b) If a work release\napproved inmate does not have sufficient funds in his personal account to cover the expenses connected with\nsearching for employment, the inmate's correction counselor or temporary release parole officer, depending\nupon who has been designated this duty by the superintendent, may authorize the business office to advance to\nthe inmate a maximum of $20 per day for all of his expenses, including meals and transportation costs not\nprovided by the facility. The inmate should be made to understand that all money advanced to him must be\nrepaid to the department as soon as the inmate has funds to repay these advances. (iii)\n\nFurloughs. (a) If a newly arrived\ncontinuous temporary release participant has never gone out of the facility on a family ties furlough since\nhis arrival in the facility and cannot go on a family ties furlough because he has insufficient funds in his\npersonal account, the inmate's correction counselor or temporary release parole officer, depending upon who\nhas been assigned this responsibility by the facility's superintendent, may authorize the business office to\nadvance the inmate up to $25 to cover the transportation costs of one furlough. However, the inmate may only\nbe advanced funds to cover the transportation costs of one, and only one, furlough, and all other furlough\nexpenses must be deducted from his own personal account. (b) If a\ncontinuous temporary release participant has sufficient funds in his personal account, the inmate will be\nallowed to request the business office to release his funds for transportation and expenses. However, the\ndisbursement of furlough funds from a continuous temporary release participant's personal account should not\nbe allowed to deplete the inmate's personal account to the point that he may not be able to meet the\nfollowing week's work or educational leave expenses, and the correction counselor or temporary release parole\nofficer should make certain that the inmate's request for funds will not do so before approving his IAS\n2706. (c) For the same reason as was given above, the inmate's\ncorrection counselor, temporary release parole officer, and the superintendent should be very selective when\nreviewing the requests for out-of-area furloughs from inmates whose proposed furlough residences are far\nremoved from the facility and who are requesting larger than usual amounts of transportation money to travel\nto and from these distant furlough addresses. (8)\n\nCredit and installment purchases. Continuous temporary release\nparticipants are prohibited from taking out business or personal loans, applying for credit or credit cards, or making purchases on credit or on an installment basis without first receiving the written approval of the\ntemporary release committee and superintendent to do so. It is expected that such approval will rarely be\ngiven, and then only for very unusual situations involving only the most emotionally mature\ninmates. (g) Supervision standards in continuous\ntemporary release programs. (1)\n\nCasework and caseload assignment. (i) Correction counselors and temporary release parole officers shall have\nconcurrent responsibility to supervise inmates who are participating in continuous temporary release\nprograms. The correction counselor shall have major casework responsibility and major supervisory\nresponsibility for inmates who are in orientation, are unemployed, or who, for one reason or another, do not\nregularly leave the facility, while the temporary release parole officer shall have major casework\nresponsibility and major supervisory responsibility for inmates who are employed, attending classes, and\nleaving the facility regularly each day. During the transition phase when an inmate is going out on job\nsearch furloughs, it will be necessary for the correction counselor and temporary release parole officer to\ncoordinate their efforts to supervise the inmate and assist him in his quest for employment. (ii)\n\nThe chairperson of the facility's temporary release committee shall, therefore, assign every temporary release participant to the supervision of a correction counselor and, after\nconsultation with the senior parole officer, make certain that each continuous temporary release participant\nhas been assigned to the supervision of a temporary release parole officer at the ratio of no more than 33\ninmate participants to each temporary release parole officer. The temporary release committee chairperson\nshall maintain records which clearly indicate which correction counselor and which temporary release parole\nofficer have been assigned to supervise each continuous temporary release participant. (iii)\n\nThe temporary release committee chairperson and in his absence, the\nsuperintendent, are the Department of Correctional Services officials at the facility level who are\nresponsible to monitor and assure the department's temporary release supervision standards are being\nmaintained. The temporary release committee chairperson is also the facility's casework manager and shall\ncoordinate the casework and supervisory activities of the correction counselor and, after consultation with\nthe senior parole officer, the temporary release parole officers. The temporary release committee chairperson\nmust be certain that casework services are being properly and efficiently delivered, that no duplication of\neffort exists, and that the inmate's activities both in-house and in the community, are being properly\ninvestigated, supervised and verified. (iv)\n\nIn order to carry out\nhis responsibilities, the temporary release committee chairperson, after consulting the senior parole\nofficer, shall schedule and preside over weekly casework conferences between the counselors, temporary\nrelease parole officers, security and administrative staff in order to monitor and discuss the progress, or\nlack of progress, of the temporary release participants in program, to discuss the problem areas among and\nbetween the various staff units providing services to the inmates, to monitor and evaluate the degree to\nwhich the department's supervisory standards are being met by the various staff units, and to assign\nresponsibility and to delegate work assignments to various staff units so as to correct any program\ndeficiencies that come to the temporary release committee chairperson's attention during these case\nconferences. (v) Due to some unique aspects and staffing patterns\nat some of the upstate work release facilities, it is recognized that some of the foregoing rules and\nregulations on casework assignment will have to be modified to satisfy local conditions. (vi)\n\nInitial interviews. As soon as possible upon reception at a continuous\ntemporary release facility, each inmate shall be given an initial interview by both the correction counselor\nand temporary release parole officer who have been assigned to supervise him. Both the correction counselor\nand temporary release parole officer shall explain the rules and regulations of the program to the inmate, and assure themselves that the inmate understands what is expected of him. (vii)\n\nCounseling sessions. (a) Both\ncorrection counselors and temporary release parole officers shall meet at the facility with each inmate for\nwhom they have major casework responsibility at least once each week in order to establish goals, review\nprogress, formulate treatment plans, provide guidance and transmit information. The temporary release\ncommittee chairperson will advise who has the major casework responsibility for the inmate at the weekly\nmeetings between the staff. (b) In order to conduct these\ncounseling sessions, it is necessary that both the correction counselors and temporary release parole\nofficers spend a minimum of one evening each week at the facility, and perhaps two evenings each week when\ntheir caseloads require such coverage. (viii)\n\nJob\ndevelopment. Correction counselors and temporary release parole officers shall have concurrent responsibility\nto develop jobs for unemployed work release participants on their caseloads. (ix)\n\nRecording. (a) The temporary release\nparole officer shall have the responsibility to submit a form 2551, chronological report, bimonthly to the\ntemporary release committee chairperson on every inmate under his supervision. In those cases where a\ntemporary release participant's progress in program is rated as unsatisfactory on the form 2551, monthly\nreport, the temporary release parole officer shall indicate on the bottom of the report the reason(s) why the\ninmate's progress in program is unsatisfactory, and his treatment plan for dealing with the inmate's\nunsatisfactory progress. (b) The temporary release parole officer\nshall also have the responsibility to submit a form 4184, monthly temporary release parole supervision\nreport, to the temporary release committee chairperson by the seventh day of the following month which will\nlist the names of all of the continuous temporary release participants whom the temporary release parole\nofficer had under supervision that month and the case contacts which the temporary release parole officer had\nwith each inmate. (c) In the event that a continuous temporary\nrelease participant is arrested while participating in program, or absconds from program, the temporary\nrelease parole officer shall be responsible for submitting a violation of temporary release report to the\ntemporary release committee chairperson, using the format normally used for violation of parole reports. The\nviolation of temporary release report should be submitted within two weeks of the date that the continuous\ntemporary release participant was arrested or absconded. (2)\n\nField supervision. (i) Inmate's\nfurlough residence. (a) Verification of inmate's furlough residence prior\nto initial furlough. (1)\n\nNo inmate shall be granted a furlough while\nparticipating in a continuous TRP unless the proposed furlough residence has been approved by the facility's\ntemporary release committee chairperson. (2)\n\nIn the case of an\ninmate with an out-of-area furlough residence which is located outside of the county, or in New York City, outside of the city, where the facility is located, no inmate shall be granted a furlough while participating\nin a continuous temporary release program unless either a parole officer has visited the residence within the\npast six months and that residence has been approved for furlough purposes by the facility's temporary\nrelease committee chairperson or until the facility's temporary release committee chairperson has mailed out\na temporary release program residence questionnaire to the person who is offering the inmate a furlough\nresidence and that questionnaire has been returned to the facility containing the notarized signature of the\nperson offering the inmate a furlough residence. Whenever possible, this returned questionnaire should be\nfollowed up by the temporary release parole officer conducting a telephone interview with the person who has\nreturned the signed and notarized temporary release program residence questionnaire before the inmate is\nactually released on a furlough. (3)\n\nIn any case where there is\nan unusual amount of doubt about the suitability of the inmate's proposed furlough residence, or for other\nunusual reasons, the inmate should not be granted a furlough while participating in a continuous temporary\nrelease program until a parole officer has requested an out-of-area parole supervision investigation on form\nIS-2 from the Division of Parole area parole office which covers the geographic region where the inmate's\nfurlough residence is located, that investigation has been completed, and the proposed furlough residence has\nbeen approved by the facility's temporary release committee chairperson. (b) Verification of furlough residence after the inmate's initial furlough. (1)\n\nEach temporary release parole officer (with the exception of\nout-of-area cases noted in subclause [4] of this clause) should make a minimum of one home visit monthly to\nthe approved furlough residence of those inmates who are participating in furloughs. That home visit may take\nplace on a weekend day or holiday when the inmate could be expected to be at his furlough residence. When an\ninmate is on a furlough, he should anticipate a visit by a temporary release parole officer, and, where\nwarranted, the parole officer may impose a curfew in order to make certain that he will find the inmate at\nhis furlough residence. Regular visits to the inmate's residence, including personal interviews with the\ninmate and members of his family, are an essential part of the casework process. It is very important that\nthe parole office endeavor to gain, in the course of home visits, an adequate knowledge of members of the\ninmate's family and their attitudes toward each other, the inmate and his problems. It is especially\nimportant that the parole officer attempt to become informed of any unusual problems which the family members\nare aware that the inmate is experiencing so that the proper corrective action can be taken. The simplest\naccomplishment of a home visit is residence verification. (2)\n\nThe\ntemporary release parole officer must make at lease one positive home visit to a continuous temporary release\nparticipant's approved furlough residence (with the exception of out-of-area cases noted in subclause [4] of\nthis clause) every three months. In order for a positive home visit to have taken place, the parole officer\nmust actually see the inmate present inside of his approved furlough residence. (3)\n\nIf a continuous temporary release participant is not taking part in the\nfurlough program and the temporary release parole officer has no responsibility to visit or verify the\ninmate's furlough residence (including out-of-area cases) this fact shall be carefully recorded in the\ninmate's case file each month and on form 2551 and form 4184 monthly reports. (4)\n\nWhere the continuous temporary release participant's approved furlough\nresidence is outside the region covered by the area parole office where the facility is located (or if\nfurloughed from a New York City facility and the residence is outside of the New York City and Long Island\nregion), the temporary release parole officer is not required to make home visits to the inmate's furlough\nresidence. However, after an inmate has completed his initial furlough the temporary release parole officer\nshall request an out-of-area parole supervision investigation on form IS-2 from the area parole officer which\ncovers the geographic region where the inmate's furlough residence is located. If this IS-2 is returned\nindicating that there are not unusual problems with the inmate's furlough residence and that he had no\nunusual problems in the community while out on his furlough, the temporary release parole officer is not\nrequired to request any further checks of the inmate's furlough residence by the Division of Parole. However, the temporary release parole officer shall complete a minimum of one telephone call to the inmate's approved\nfurlough residence each month in an attempt to verify the inmate's furlough residence, establish a\nrelationship with his family, and to learn of any problems which the family is aware that the inmate is\nexperiencing so that corrective action may be taken. In those out-of-area cases where the inmate's approved\nfurlough residence does not have a telephone, the temporary release parole officer shall once a month request\nan out-of-area parole supervision investigation on form IS-2 from the area parole office which covers the\ngeographic region where the inmate's approved furlough residence is located. Also, in certain out-of-area\ncases where the temporary release parole officer suspects that the inmate is having unusual problems, or, perhaps is making an unsatisfactory community adjustment while on furlough--even in those areas where the\nparole officer is in telephone contact with the inmate's furlough residence--the parole officer shall request\nan out-of-area parole supervision investigation on form IS-2 from the area parole office which covers the\ngeographic region where the inmate's furlough residence is located. (5)\n\nWhere the continuous temporary release participant's furlough residence\nis outside of the city or town where the facility is located, the chairperson of the facility's temporary\nrelease committee shall see to it that prior to the inmate's initial furlough a form TRP-8 shall be forwarded\nto the appropriate local law enforcement agency and to the area parole office which covers the geographic\nregion where the inmate's furlough residence is located, at least five days prior to the initial furlough\nalerting them of the inmate's pending furlough, his furlough address, and the name, work location and\ntelephone number of the temporary release parole officer that has the inmate under continuous temporary\nrelease parole supervision. Provided that the initial TRP-8 alerts the local law enforcement agency and area\nparole office that the inmate will be continually released on a furlough at specified periods of time\nthereafter, there is no need to forward other form TRP-8's each time that the inmate goes on a\nfurlough. (6)\n\nInmates who participate in continuous temporary\nrelease programs who are already under the supervision of a parole officer and who have furlough residences\noutside of the geographic region where the facility is located are not subject to the same reporting\nrequirements as apply to general confinement inmates described in Part 1901 of this Title. However, the\ntemporary release parole officer may, in unusual situations where he feels that it is appropriate, instruct\nthe continuous temporary release participant to report to the area office if he has first made certain that\nthe area office has the means to take a report from the inmate. (ii)\n\nInmate's employment program. (a) The\ntemporary release parole officer must make at least one positive employment visit per month to the inmate's\nplace of employment in order to verify a continuous temporary release participant's employment program. Besides verifying the inmate's employment, the temporary release parole officer should use the employment\nvisits to obtain information about the inmate's attendance, work habits, attitude toward work, and any other\ninformation which might be useful in planning for the casework needs of the inmate. (b) The temporary release parole officer must make a positive employment\nvisit to the inmate's place of employment during the first 10 days from the date an inmate becomes employed\non a new job, and one positive employment visit to the inmate's place of employment every month thereafter. In order for a positive employment visit to have taken place, the temporary release parole officer must\nactually see the inmate present at his approved place of employment. (c) When making his initial employment visit to the inmate's place of\nemployment, the temporary release parole officer will make certain that the inmate's employer, or a\nrepresentative of the inmate's employer, has been made aware of the inmate's work release status. If for some\nreason the inmate's employer, or a representative of his employer, has not been advised about the work\nrelease status of the inmate, the temporary release parole officer shall be responsible for informing the\nemployer of this fact. Further, if the inmate's history of a specific type of criminal behavior, when viewed\nbeside the type or nature of the employment which the inmate will be performing, would constitute a special\nhazard for the employer or the community, the temporary release parole officer shall have the responsibility\nto make the employer aware of these facts. However, under no circumstances shall any temporary release parole\nofficer (or for that matter any New York State employee) give the employer any information whatsoever about\nthe inmate's use of illegal narcotic drugs, excessive use of alcoholic beverages, mental health status, or\nphysical health status without first obtaining a written statement from the inmate authorizing the department\nto release such information. (d) Upon completion of his initial\nemployment visit to the inmate's place of employment, the temporary release parole officer will record on his\nform 2551, monthly report, that the inmate's employer has been made aware of the inmate's work release status\nand whether or not the inmate's history of a specific type of criminal behavior would constitute a special\nhazard. If so, the temporary release parole officer must record on form 2551 that the inmate's employer was\nso informed. (iii)\n\nInmate's educational release\nprogram. (a) The temporary release parole officer must make a minimum of\none positive employment visit each month to the school where the inmate is taking part in an educational\nrelease program. In order for such a positive employment visit to have taken place, the temporary release\nparole officer must actually see the inmate, himself, present at school. (b) The temporary release parole officer shall make use of these employment\nvisits to the inmate's school in order to establish relationships with the staff of the institution which may\nhelp him to monitor the inmate's progress, or lack of progress, in his educational release program. (c) When making his initial employment visit to the inmate's school or\ncollege, the temporary release parole officer shall make certain that the school or college's Registrar or\n\nDean of academic affairs, or an appropriate representative of these officials, is aware of the educational\nrelease status of the inmate, and shall follow the procedures previously detailed in clause (ii)(c) of this\nparagraph. (d) Section 852.3  of the Correction Law, states that\nthe department may only permit temporary release participants to take part in educational release programs at\nschools and colleges which agree to maintain attendance records for participating inmates. The temporary\nrelease parole officer shall, therefore, have the responsibility to make certain that the educational release\nparticipant's school or college maintains a record of class attendance for each educational release\nparticipant, and that this attendance record is continually and accurately maintained by the\ncollege. (e) The temporary release parole officer should request\nthat each school or college which has educational release participants enrolled in classes designate a staff\nmember to act as a liaison with him, and the name of this person should be reported to the temporary release\ncommittee chairperson. The liaison person should receive the attendance records from the school's instructors\nnot less frequently than once every two weeks, and should make them available to the temporary release parole\nofficer as required. (f) Temporary release parole officers who\nsupervise educational release participants must verify each participant's attendance in classes a minimum of\nonce every two weeks. Unauthorized absences from classes are to be immediately reported to the facility's\ntemporary release committee chairperson. (g) In order for the\ntemporary release parole officer to more easily accomplish his responsibility to supervise educational\nrelease participants, he should contact the person who has been delegated as his liaison with the school or\ncollege, and provide him with a list of inmates planning to attend the college during the next semester. The\nliaison person, upon receipt of this list and after registration for classes, will be able to determine the\neducational release participants' class schedule, obtain the necessary attendance information from the\ninmate's instructors, and alert the temporary release parole officer of any unsatisfactory behavior, deteriorating class performance, or lack of interest on the part of the inmate. (h) The temporary release parole officer supervising educational release\nparticipants shall maintain attendance records in his field log for all educational release participants and\nshall file these attendance records in the inmate's institutional file when the inmate completes his\neducational release program or leaves the correctional facility. (i) Section 855.4  of the Correction Law, states that the department shall\nconsider the scheduling of classes to insure a reduction of release time (for educational release\nparticipants) not spent in educational pursuits. Consequently, the hours during which an educational release\nparticipant is permitted to be away from the correctional facility should bear a direct relation to the\nbeginning and ending times of classes and should allow only reasonable travel time to and from the facility. The inmate's correction counselor and temporary release parole officer should, therefore, demand that the\neducational release participant schedule his classes as close together as possible in order to minimize idle\ntime spent between classes. Of course, allowances may be made for reasonable meal periods and occasional\nperiods of time for library study, conferences with instructors and counselors and for special help and\nattention from the school. (j) However, it is clear that the\nintent of the State Legislature is obviously to reduce the amount of time that an educational release\nparticipant spends on campus while not engaged in educational pursuits. The temporary release committee\nchairperson should ensure that the correction counselor and temporary release parole officer has this fact in\nmind when scheduling the educational release participant's day outside of the facility. (k) Each facility's temporary release committee chairperson shall keep a\nrecord of every inmate enrolled in a vocational or college level educational release program. At the\nconclusion of each semester the temporary release committee chairperson shall prepare and forward to the\ndirector of temporary release programs a list of all inmates who were enrolled in educational release\nprograms at his facility that semester and indicate on the list whether or not the inmate completed the\nsemester in a satisfactory manner. If the inmate did not complete the semester in a satisfactory manner for\nany reason (including parole, transfer to another facility, sickness, etc.), the list will indicate the\nreason(s) for the inmate's noncompletion. Whenever possible, the temporary release committee chairperson will\nrequest that the temporary release parole officer provide him with a transcript of the inmate's grades while\nin an educational release program during the semester and a photostatic copy of these transcripts will be\nforwarded to the director of temporary release programs attached to the temporary release committee\nchairperson's previously mentioned list. (iv)\n\nCommunity\nservices leave and industrial training leave programs. Inmates who are participating in continuous community\nservices leave and industrial training leave programs shall be subject to the same supervision standards as\nare specified in this subdivision. (3)\n\nFurlough\nschedules and procedures for continuous temporary release participants. (i) Requests for furlough. The facility superintendent of the work release facility will establish the furlough\nschedule for inmates participating in a work release or educational release program of continuous temporary\nrelease. The facility superintendent of the general confinement facility overseeing a program of industrial\ntraining leave or community service leave will establish the furlough schedule for inmates participating in\nsuch programs of continuous temporary release. Such schedules may allow for repetitive, recurring furloughs\nprovided that each individual furlough shall not exceed seven days in duration in accordance with Correction\n\nLaw, section\n851. (ii)\n\nParole board\ndecisions which change an inmate's status with relation to his next parole board appearance date are to be\ntaken into account in determining the inmate's furlough scheduling. Whenever an inmate appears before the\nboard and is ordered held by the board, in addition to meeting and reviewing the question of whether the\ninmate should continue to remain in his continuous temporary release program, the temporary release committee\nmust also determine whether a change in the inmate's furlough scheduling is in order. (iii)\n\nInmates without suitable furlough addresses may only be given\nfurloughs for short, specified periods of time in order to take part in specified activities, section\n1903.2\n(e)(7)\nof this Part. (4)\n\nAbsconding from\ncontinuous temporary release programs. (i) The facility shall follow the\nsame absconder procedures detailed in section\n1901.2\n(b)(3)(iv)\nof this Title, for general confinement, short-term temporary release participants except as noted in this\nparagraph. (ii)\n\nThe temporary release parole officer who had the\ncontinuous temporary release participant under supervision, upon being advised that the participant has\nfailed to return to the facility, shall have the responsibility to verify that the participant has, in fact, absconded from temporary release. This verification shall be done, wherever possible, by making visits to the\nabsconder's furlough residence and place of employment. When the temporary release parole officer finds it\nimpossible to make visits to the absconder's furlough residence and place of employment, he must, at a very\nminimum, make telephone contact with them. (iii)\n\nFor the first 30\ndays after a continuous temporary release participant has absconded from temporary release, the temporary\nrelease parole officer and the Department of Correctional Services inspector general's office shall have a\nconcurrent responsibility to search for and apprehend the absconder. Generally speaking, the inspector\ngeneral's office will assume the major responsibility for the search for and apprehension of the absconder if\nhe is in the New York City metropolitan area, while the temporary release parole officer will assume major\nresponsibility for the search and apprehension of continuous temporary releasees who abscond from upstate\ncorrectional facilities and remain in the upstate area. (iv)\n\nTemporary release parole officers are not to search for or attempt to apprehend continuous temporary release\nparticipants in the New York City metropolitan area without first consulting with the agent in charge of the\ninspector general's office's absconder search unit to assure no duplication of effort in the search for the\nabsconder. (v) If a continuous temporary release participant has\nnot been apprehended within 30 days of the date that he absconded, the inspector general's office will assume\ntotal responsibility, in coordination with law enforcement agencies, for the search and apprehension of the\nabsconder. However, the temporary release parole officer shall still remain attentive to the absconder\neffort, should pass on all leads which come to his attention to the inspector general's absconder search\nunit, and shall be available to assist the staff of that unit when they are requested to do so. (vi)\n\nThe temporary release parole officers are responsible for preparing a\nviolation of temporary release report using the format normally used in a violation of parole report within\ntwo weeks of the date that a continuous temporary release participant absconds from temporary release. If the\nabsconder is later arrested on new criminal charges, the temporary release parole officers are responsible\nfor preparing a supplementary violation of temporary release report detailing the new criminal charges within\ntwo weeks of the date that this new arrest takes place. (5)\n\nNew arrests of continuous temporary release participants. (i) The facility shall follow the same procedures for new arrests of\ncontinuous temporary release participants as was detailed in section\n1901.2\n(b)(3)(v)\nof this Title, for short-term temporary release participants except as noted below. (ii)\n\nThe temporary release parole officer, upon being advised of the\ncontinuous temporary release participant's new arrest, is responsible for gathering the facts surrounding the\nnew arrest, presenting these facts to the temporary release committee chairperson or superintendent, and\nfollowing up to determine the court's disposition of the pending criminal charges. (iii)\n\nIf a decision is made to issue a violation of temporary release\nwarrant for the inmate's detention, the temporary release parole officer is responsible for lodging this\nwarrant at the place where the inmate is confined. (iv)\n\nWhen a\ncontinuous temporary release participant is arrested, the temporary release parole officer who had him under\nhis supervision is responsible for the preparation of a violation of temporary release report presenting the\nfacts surrounding the new arrest within two weeks of the date of the inmate's arrest. The temporary release\nparole officer shall also prepare and submit a supplementary violation of temporary release report within two\nweeks of the date of a court disposition of this new arrest. (6)\n\nTemporary release committee review. (i) Whenever any employee of the Department of Correctional Services or\n\nDivision of Parole at a facility where a continuous temporary release participant is confined has any\nfirsthand knowledge that a participant's adjustment in program is unsatisfactory or deteriorating, he must\ncomplete a form 4187, request for temporary release committee review, indicating the reason(s) for his\nconcern as detailed in the following section and submit the completed form 4187 to the temporary release\ncommittee chairperson. (ii)\n\nThe temporary release committee\nchairperson must then arrange for the temporary release committee to interview the inmate, review the\nsituation, and then make a recommendation to the superintendent on form 4187. (iii)\n\nAfter the superintendent has made a decision in the case, it must be\nrecorded on form 4187. The original form 4187 must be maintained at the facility and a copy placed in the\ninmate's file. The superintendent's decision is final unless the inmate appeals the decision to the director\nof central office temporary release programs (see section\n1904.3\nof this Title). Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
