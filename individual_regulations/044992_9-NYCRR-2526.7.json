Tit. 9 § 2526.7 - Determination of legal regulated rents; penalties; fines; assessment of costs; attorney's fees; rent credits; where the proceeding is commenced on or after June 14, 2019\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. (1)\n\nBase Date: For the purposes of this\nsection, the Base Date shall be the date of the most recent reliable annual\nrent registration statement, filed and served upon a tenant six or more years\nprior to the filing of a complaint of overcharge or the initiation of a\nproceeding to determine the legal regulated rent of an apartment. Any\nregistration statement filed contemporaneously with a certification of service\nshall be presumed to have been served upon the tenant in occupancy. In no event\nshall the base date be prior to June 14, 2015. Absent an exception set forth in section\n2526.1\nof this Part, if no base\ndate can be determined subsequent to June 14, 2015, the base date shall be June\n14, 2015. (2)\n\nReliable rent\nregistration statement: A rent registration shall be considered to be reliable\nif, prior to the filing of such registration statement, and subsequent to June\n14, 2015, the rent history contains no unexplained increases in the\nrent. (b) The DHCR shall\nconsider all available reasonably necessary evidence when making a\ndetermination as to the reliability of a rent registration statement, including\nbut not limited to: (1)\nany rent registration\nor other records filed with the state division of housing and community\nrenewal, or any other state, municipal or federal agency, regardless of the\ndate to which the information on such registration refers; (2)\nany order issued by any state, municipal\nor federal agency; (3)\nany records\nmaintained by the owner or tenants; and\n(4)\nany public record kept in the regular\ncourse of business by any state, municipal or federal agency. (c) The DHCR shall set the legal\nregulated rent by adding any lawful rent increases and adjustments to the rent\non the base date. (d) The DHCR\nshall examine the rent prior to the base date and subsequent to June 14, 2015\nto make a determination as to: (1)\nwhether the\nlegality of a rental amount charged or registered is reliable in light of all\navailable evidence including, but not limited to, whether an unexplained\nincrease in the registered or lease rents, or a fraudulent scheme to\ndestabilize the housing accommodation, rendered such rent or registration\nunreliable. (2)\nwhether an\naccommodation is subject to the emergency tenant protection act or the rent\nstabilization law; (3)\nwhether an\norder issued by the division of housing and community renewal or by a court, including, but not limited to an order issued pursuant to section\n2523.4\n(a) of this\ntitle, or any regulatory agreement or other contract with any governmental\nagency, and remaining in effect within six years of the filing of a complaint\npursuant to this section, affects or limits the amount of rent that may be\ncharged or collected; (4)\nwhether\nan overcharge was or was not willful; (5)\nwhether a rent adjustment that requires\ninformation regarding the length of occupancy by a present or prior tenant was\nlawful; (6)\nthe existence or terms\nand conditions of a preferential rent, or the propriety of a legal registered\nrent during a period when the tenants were charged a preferential\nrent; (7)\nthe legality of a rent\ncharged or registered immediately prior to the registration of a preferential\nrent; or\n(8)\nthe amount of the\nlegal regulated rent where the apartment was vacant or temporarily exempt on\nthe date six years prior to a tenant's complaint. (e) The DHCR shall examine the rent prior to\n\nJune 14 15, 2015, pursuant to 9 NYCRR §\n2526.1. (f) A tenant may file a complaint of\novercharge at any time. (g) An\nowner may, prior to the issuance of an order determining the existence of an\novercharge, file late registration statements. Provided that increases in the\nlegal regulated rent were lawful except for the failure to file a timely\nregistration, the owner, upon the service and filing of a late registration, shall not be found to have collected an overcharge at any time prior to the\nfiling of the late registration. (h) (1)\n\nAny\naffected tenant shall be given notice of and an opportunity to commence a\nsubsequent proceeding or an opportunity to join in any proceeding commenced by\nthe DHCR pursuant to this section. (2)\n\nWhere a complainant pursuant to this\nsubdivision vacates the housing accommodation, and the DHCR continues the\nproceeding, the DHCR shall give any affected tenant notice of and an\nopportunity to commence a subsequent proceeding or an opportunity to join in\nsuch proceeding. (i) Damages\n(1)\n\nAny owner who is found by the\nDHCR, after a reasonable opportunity to be heard, to have collected any rent or\nother consideration in excess of the collectable rent shall be ordered to pay\nto the tenant a penalty equal to three times the amount of such excess, except\nas provided under subdivision (f) of this section. If the owner establishes by\na preponderance of the evidence that the overcharge was not willful, the DHCR\nshall establish the penalty as the amount of the overcharge plus interest, which interest shall accrue from the date of the first overcharge on or after\nthe base date, at the rate of interest payable on a judgment pursuant to\nsection\n5004\nof the Civil Practice Law and Rules, and the order shall direct such a payment to be made to the tenant. (2)\n\nAny recovery of overcharge penalties, including treble damages, where appropriate, shall be limited to the six years\npreceding the complaint, provided, however, that there shall be no recovery of\ntreble damages for overcharges that occurred prior to June 15, 2017, and no\nrecovery of damages forover charges that occurred prior to June 15, 2015. After\na complaint of rent overcharge has been filedand served on an owner, the\nvoluntary adjustment of the rent and/or the voluntary tender of a refund ofrent\novercharges shall not be considered by the division of housing and community\nrenewal as evidence that the overcharge was not willful. (3)\na penalty of three times the overcharge\nmay not be based upon an overcharge having occurred-priorto April 1, 1984. (4)\n(i) Complaints filed prior to April 1, 1984\nshall be determined in accordance with the RSL and Code provisions in effect on\n\nMarch 31, 1984, except that an overcharge collected on or after April 1, 1984\nmay be subject to treble damages pursuant to this section. (ii)\n\nComplaints filed on or after April 1, 1984 and prior to June 14, 2019 shall be determined pursuant to 9 NYCRR §\n2526.1. (5)\n\nThe DHCR shall determine the owner's\nliability between or among two or more tenants found to have been overcharged\nduring their particular occupancy of a housing accommodation, and at its\ndiscretion, may require the owner to make diligent efforts to locate prior\ntenants who are not parties to the proceeding, and to make refunds to such\ntenants or pay the amount of such penalty as a fine. (6)\n\nAn owner who is found to have overcharged\nby the DHCR shall be assessed and ordered to pay as an additional penalty the\nreasonable costs and attorney's fees of the proceeding, and except where treble\ndamages are awarded, interest from the date of the overcharge occurring on or\nafter April 1, 1984, at the rate of interest payable on a judgment pursuant to\nsection\n5004\nof the Civil Practice Law and\n\nRules. (7)\nA tenant may recover any\novercharge penalty established by the DHCR by deducting it from the rent due to\nthe present owner at a rate not in excess of 20 percent of the amount of the\npenalty for anyone month's rent. If no such rent credit has been taken, the\norder of the DHCR awarding penalties maybe entered, filed and enforced by a\ntenant in the same manner as a judgment of the Supreme Court, on a form\nprescribed by the DHCR, provided that the amount of the penalty exceeds $1,000\nor the tenant is no longer in possession. Neither of these remedies are\navailable until the expiration of the period in which the owner may institute a\nproceeding pursuant to Part 2530 of this Title. (8)\n\nResponsibility for overcharges. (i). For overcharges collected prior to April\n1, 1984, an owner will be held responsible only for his or her portion of the\nover charges, in the absence of collusion or any relationship between such\nowner and any prior owners. (ii). (a) For overcharge complaints filed or\novercharges collected on or after April 1, 1984, a current owner shall be\nresponsible for all overcharge penalties, including penalties based upon\novercharges collected by any prior owner. However, in the absence of collusion\nor any relationship between such owner and any prior owner, where no records\nsufficient to establish the legal regulated rent were provided at a judicial\nsale, or such other sale effected in connection with, or to resolve, in whole\nor in part, a bankruptcy proceeding, mortgage foreclosure action or other\njudicial proceeding, an owner who purchases upon or subsequent to such sale\nshall not be liable for overcharges collected by any owner prior to such sale, and treble damages upon overcharges that he or she collects which result from\novercharges collected by any owner prior to such sale. An owner who did not\npurchase at such sale, but who purchased subsequent to such sale, shall also\nnot be liable for overcharges collected by any prior owner subsequent to such\nsale to the extent that such overcharges are the result of overcharges\ncollected prior to such sale. (b) Court-appointed receivers. A receiver who is appointed by a court of competent\njurisdiction to receive rent for the use or occupation of a housing\naccommodation shall not, in the absence of collusion or any relationship\nbetween such receiver and any owner or other receiver, be liable for over\ncharges collected by any owner or other receiver, and treble damages upon\novercharges that he or she collects which result from overcharges collected by\nany owner or other receiver, where records sufficient to establish the legal\nregulated rent have not been made available to such receiver. Penalties\npursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the time limitations set forth\nin paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (9)\n\nThis subdivision shall not be construed\nto entitle a tenant to more than one refund for the same overcharge. (j) Where no rent history for the\nhousing accommodation is available, the rent shall be determined in the manner\nset forth in Section\n2522.6\nof this title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
