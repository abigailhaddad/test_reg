  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1648-3.1 - When submitted\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nactual and final amount of State subsidy due a project is not known until after\nthe close of the fiscal year, and then after audit. The Public Housing Law, however, provides that portions of the State subsidy payable for any one year\nmay be paid from time to time, as required. Advances of State subsidy against\nthe operating deficit of a project may therefore be made at any time during the\nyear. Local agencies need not wait until after the close of the year to apply\nfor State subsidy for that year but should endeavor to anticipate their needs\nfor funds and make timely application for State subsidy as required. (b) The number of subsidy requisitions which\nmay be submitted in a fiscal year and the dates for the submitting of\nrequisitions are not fixed but are directly related to the need for funds. It\nwill be found that, inasmuch as debt service payments for interest and\namortization represent the largest single outlays of cash required over the\nyear, the timing and frequency of subsidy requisitions will ordinarily be\ngoverned by the debt service dates. It should be understood, however, that\nsubsidy requisitions may be submitted to meet cash needs for other than debt\nservice payments. In general, subsidy requisitions should be submitted at least\n45 days in advance of the need for the funds in order to allow the division\nsufficient time to examine the requisition and process the subsidy voucher\nthrough the other State departments concerned. (c) The division will be glad to assist and\nadvise local agencies in preparing subsidy requisitions, but the primary\nresponsibility for making timely requests for subsidy to put the local agency\nin funds to meet all obligations when due rests with the local\nagency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1648-3.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
