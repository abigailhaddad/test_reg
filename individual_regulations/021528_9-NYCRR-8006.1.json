Tit. 9 § 8006.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An\nadministrative appeal may be taken from a final determination of the Board of\n\nParole regarding a parole release, parole rescission or final revocation\nproceeding. (b) The administrative\nappeal process is initiated by the filing of a notice of appeal within 30 days\nof the date that the incarcerated person/violator or their attorney receives\nwritten notice of the final decision from which the appeal is taken. The\nfailure to file a notice of appeal within the aforementioned time limit shall\nconstitute a waiver of the right of appeal by the incarcerated\nperson/violator. (c) A notice of\nappeal and subsequent related correspondence, including the document submitted\nto perfect the appeal, shall be filed with the New York State Board of Parole, Appeals Unit, The Harriman State Campus,, Albany, NY 12226. (d) The notice of appeal shall state the name\nand State identification number of the incarcerated person/violator; the date\nof the hearing and, in the case of a final revocation proceeding, the date of\nthe determination; the incarcerated person/violator's present place of\nincarceration or residential address; and the place where the hearing occurred. While a Department form entitled Notice of Appeal may be made available for use\nby an incarcerated person/violator, it is not required that said form be\nutilized to initiate the appeal process. (e) At the time of the filing of the notice\nof appeal, the incarcerated person/violator or the attorney therefor may\nrequest a copy of the transcript of the proceeding from which the appeal was\ntaken. The appeals unit will obtain the transcript as soon as practicable and\nforward it to the incarcerated person/violator or their attorney. There shall\nbe a copying charge of 25 cents per page. All other nonconfidential, discoverable documents relating to the appeal may be obtained upon written\nrequest to the appropriate Department officer, pursuant to 9 NYCRR\n8000.5\n(c)(3). The time required to obtain, copy and transmit the transcript to\nthe appellant or their counsel shall not extend the time limit within which the\nappeal shall be perfected, except that such time may be a basis for a request\nfor an extension, in accordance with 9 NYCRR\n8006.2\n(a). (f) Each notice of appeal received by the\nappeals unit will be acknowledged in writing, and the final date to perfect the\nappeal will be stated thereon. (g) In any case where an appeal was filed with a court of law pursuant to\nsubdivision (4-a) of Section\n259-i\nof the\n\nExecutive Law from the sustaining of, in a final revocation proceeding, a\nnon-technical violation charge concerning felony or misdemeanor conduct, then: (1)\n\nNo notice of administrative appeal from\nthe final revocation proceeding shall be accepted and no such administrative\nappeal shall be considered while the subdivision (4-a) matter remains pending, or while any appeal or other litigation from the court of law's decisions\ntherefrom remain open. (2)\n\nAny\nnon-technical violation findings shall not be considered as a subject of\nadministrative appeal to the Board pursuant to this Part. Commencement of an\nappeal pursuant to subdivision (4-a) of any non-technical violation finding\nconstitutes a permanent forfeiture of the right to appeal all non-technical\nviolation findings in the revocation proceeding pursuant to this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nShould the subdivision\n(4-a) matter be commenced subsequent to the filing of a notice of appeal\npursuant to this Part, said administrative appeal shall be deemed cancelled\nupon commencement of the subdivision (4-a) appeal, except, in the Board's\ndiscretion, where findings of the Appeals Unit and/or the decision of the Board\non the administrative appeal have been issued. (4)\nA notice of appeal from a final\nrevocation proceeding may be filed and such appeal thereafter considered, with\nrespect to the sustaining of any technical violation charges, following\nconclusion of the subdivision (4-a) matter and where there is no appeal or\nlitigation from the court of law's decisions therefrom. (i) The incarcerated person/violator and\ntheir attorney shall assume that no prior notice of administrative appeal or\nappeal submissions will be considered absent express authorization to the\ncontrary from the Appeals Unit. (ii)\n\nThe appeal process shall proceed in all other manner in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Part as though the date of the final conclusion of the\nsubdivision (4-a) matter and any appeal or litigation therefrom constitutes the\n\"written notice\" referenced in subdivision (b) of this section, and the notice\nof appeal must be filed within 30 days of that conclusion.
