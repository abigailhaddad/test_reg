  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 153.1 - Introduction-statutory authority of director of division of the budget to approve guidelines\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nguidelines contained herein are promulgated pursuant to the authority of the\ndirector of the Division of the Budget (the director) to establish guidelines\nfor future mortgage modifications as set forth in chapter 888 of the Laws of\n1980 (the amendment). (b) Chapter\n888 of the Laws of 1980, which was signed into law by the Governor on November\n26, 1980, amended the Private Housing Finance Law and required the Housing\n\nFinance Agency (HFA) to establish a Housing Project Repair Fund (PRF or the\nfund). Monies appropriated to or deposited in the fund, may be used for the\ncorrection of construction-related problems in housing projects financed by HFA\nor for the repair, reconstruction or replacement of facilities and\ninfrastructure related to those projects. Fifteen percent of the monies in the\nfund must be allocated to HFA and State-financed projects for energy\nconservation projects or for improvements to protect the safety and health of\ntenants. (c) In some instances, a\nhousing project may be required to enter into a mortgage modification agreement\nin order to qualify for project repair funds. A mortgage modification agreement\nis a document which restructures mortgage payment requirements and allows the\nmortgagor (the housing company), for a limited period of time, to make mortgage\npayments lower than those required by the original mortgage agreement. Subdivision 3 of section\n60\nof the Private Housing Finance Law provides that the agency \"shall not expend\nmoneys from the fund as payment to any housing company for the correction of a\nconstruction-related problem unless the following conditions have been met.\"\nAmong the conditions specified is the requirement that, pursuant to section\n60\n(3)(ii)\nof the Private Housing Finance Law, \"a mortgage modification agreement has been entered into with the housing\ncompany which operates the project, after consultation with the commissioner\nand in accordance with guidelines approved by the Director of the\n\nBudget.\"\n(d) The amendment\nspecifies both: (1)\nthe circumstances under\nwhich a project must obtain a mortgage modification agreement in order to\nqualify for the receipt of money from the Project Repair Fund; and\n(2)\nthe major terms and conditions of such\nmortgage modification agreements.
