  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 819.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor purposes of this Part, the following definitions are\napplicable: (a) Substance use disorder\nresidential service or residential service means a substance use disorder\nresidential service providing an array of services for persons with substance\nuse disorders, which may be provided directly or through cooperative\nrelationships with other community service providers. (b) Levels of service. There are three levels\nof service that can be offered in a residential setting which are distinguished\nby the complement of services available on site as well as the functional\ncapacity of the patient served in each setting: (1)\n\nIntensive residential rehabilitation\nservices means substance use disorder residential services requiring twenty\nfour hours a day, seven days per week treatment in a structured environment for\nindividuals whose potential for independent living in recovery is contingent\nupon social habilitation or rehabilitation. An integral part of this service is\nthe case management of additional services from other providers that are needed\nby the resident. This level of residential service requires established written\nagreements with other appropriately certified providers to furnish physical and\nmental health treatment services, in addition to educational, social and\nvocational services. These services are appropriate for individuals who require\nsubstance use disorder services in a residential setting as determined by\nutilizing the OASAS level of care determination protocol. (2)\n\nCommunity residential services means\nsubstance use disorder residential services providing supervised services to\npersons making the transition to independent living. Persons appropriate for\nthis service require the support of a substance free environment while\nreceiving either outpatient services or educational and/or vocational services. These transitional residential services are for individuals who are completing\nor have completed a course of treatment, but who are not ready for independent\nliving yet due to unresolved clinical issues or unmet needs for personal, social or vocational skills development. These services are appropriate for\nindividuals who require ongoing clinical support. (3)\n\nSupportive living services means\nsubstance use disorder treatment services which are designed to promote\nindependent living in a supervised setting for individuals who have completed\nanother course of treatment, are making the transition to independent living, and whose need for services does not require staffing on site twenty-four hours\na day. These treatment services are for individuals who either require a\nlong-term supportive environment following care in another type of residential\nservice for an undetermined length of stay, or who are in need of a\ntransitional living environment prior to establishing independent community\nliving. (c) Resident, for\npurposes of this Part, means the individual admitted to and receiving services\nfrom the residential service provider certified pursuant to this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
