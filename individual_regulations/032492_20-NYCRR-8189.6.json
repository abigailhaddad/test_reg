  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 8189.6 - Section map\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Section\nmaps shall be prepared to suitable scale for an area that may be shown on one\nmap sheet and shall be oriented true north to the top of the sheet. The map\nsheet size shall be 30 inches high by 42 inches wide. Each such section map\nshall be designated by an identifying number. The identification number of each\nsuch section map shall be shown prominently in the margin thereof. (b) A county shall be divided into one inch\nequals 400-foot basic modular units. The coordinate readings from the New York\ncoordinate system NAD27 at the four corners of the basic modular units must\nhave the coordinate northings evenly divisible by 8,000 feet and the coordinate\neastings evenly divisible by 12,000 feet. Each such modular unit shall be\ndesignated by an identifying number and shall be numbered consecutively from\nleft to right across each row of modular units in the county starting with the\ntop row. Section maps prepared by using NAD83 system would not be applicable to\nthe NAD27 logic. (c) With each\nincrease in allowable map scale the number of modular units is multiplied by\nfour. Each new modular unit is a quarter of the area represented by the\nprevious allowable smaller map scale. (1)\n\nFour modular units are required at a scale of one inch equals 200 feet to cover\nthe area of the basic modular unit at one inch equals 400 feet. Sixteen modular\nunits at a scale of one inch equals 100 feet, and 64 modular units at a scale\nof one inch equals 50 feet are required to cover the area of the basic modular\nunit at one inch equals 400 feet. (2)\n\nThe basic modular unit section number\nshall be suffixed with a two-digit number when the scale of mapping is\nenlarged. The suffix number must be unique for each scale of mapping and shall\nbe: 01 to 04 at a scale of one inch equals 200 feet, 05 to 20 at a scale of one\ninch equals 100 feet, and 21 to 84 at a scale of one inch equals 50\nfeet. (3)\n\nThe suffixes shall be\nassigned to the smaller modular units of the basic one inch equals 400 feet\nmodular unit by numbering from left to right starting with the top row of the\nsmaller modular units. (d) When a city, town or village boundary\nline divides a section, separate map sheets shall be made for each of the\ncities, towns and villages located in such section. Cities, towns and villages\nhaving identical section numbers shall not have identical block\nnumbers. (e) On each section map\nshall be shown: (1)\n\nLand parcel boundary\nlines. (2)\n\nCity, town, village, school and special district boundary lines with designations. (3)\n\nLand parcels under one acre must show all\nlineal dimensions, land parcels over one acre must show the frontage\ndimensions; where the dimensions are scaled or measured, they shall be so\nindicated. (4)\n\nLand parcels\ncontaining one acre or more must show the acreage; computed acreage must be\ncompared to the acreage indicated in the instrument of conveyance with the\nfollowing sliding tolerance scale: (i) one to\nfive acres--ten percent difference; (ii)\nfive to 20 acres--eight percent\ndifference; (iii)\n20 to 50\nacres--six percent difference; (iv)\nover 50 acres--four percent difference. If the computed acreage exceeds the tolerance, then both the\nconveyance and computed acreage must be shown. Computed acreage shall be shown\nto one tenth of an acre and shall be indicated with the letter \"(c).\"\n(5)\n\nPublic streets, public roads and highways including important private roads. (6)\n\nMajor railroads and public utility\nrights-of-way. (7)\n\nMajor bodies of\nwater such as rivers, streams, ponds, canals and lakes. (8)\n\nIdentification by popular name of all\nwholly exempt property. (9)\n\nParcel\nnumber. (10)\n\nThe north\narrow. (11)\n\nCoordinate indications\nand their readings must be shown for the four corners of the modular\nunit. (f) In addition to\nthe section identification number, the margin content of each section map shall\nalso provide for a reference to adjoining map sheets, county name, city, town\nor village name, datum, scale of map sheet to be indicated graphically, date of\ncompletion, name and address of mapping firm, provision for revision dates, legend symbols and school and special districts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n8189.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
