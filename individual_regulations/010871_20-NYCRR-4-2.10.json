  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-2.10 - Net income from commodities\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A(5)(a)(2)(I))\n(a) (1)\n\nThe\namount of net income (not less than zero) from all commodities included in New\n\nYork receipts or everywhere receipts is determined separately for sales of all\ncommodities actually delivered and sales of commodities where delivery does not\nactually occur. (i) The amount of net income\n(not less than zero) included in New York receipts from sales of commodities\nactually delivered is the product of such net income (not less than zero) and a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the amount of gross receipts from sales of\nall commodities actually delivered to points within New York State and the\ndenominator of which is the amount of all gross receipts from sales of\ncommodities actually delivered. (ii)\n\nThe amount of net income (not less than\nzero) included in New York receipts from commodities where delivery does not\nactually occur is the product of such net income (not less than zero) and a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the amount of gains from sales of\ncommodities where delivery does not actually occur to purchasers located in the\nstate and the denominator of which is the amount of gains from all sales of\ncommodities where delivery does not actually occur. 100% of net income (not\nless than zero) from sales of commodities actually delivered is included in\neverywhere receipts. 100% of net income (not less than zero) from sales of\ncommodities where delivery does not actually occur is included in everywhere\nreceipts. (2)\n\nNet income\n(not less than zero) is determined by subtracting the cost to acquire or\nproduce all commodities from the gross proceeds from the sale of commodities, provided the result cannot be less than zero. The cost to acquire or produce\nall commodities includes the purchase price of commodities and all transaction\ncosts associated with the acquisition or production of the\ncommodities. (3)\n\nExample. Corporation A, a separate article 9-A filer, makes sales\nof commodities where the commodities are actually delivered and sales of\ncommodities where delivery does not actually occur. Sales of commodities actually delivered. Corporation A has receipts from sales of commodities\nwhere the commodities are actually delivered broken down as follows: * $200 of gross receipts from gold sold to purchasers in\nstates other than New York State, but delivered to New York State; * $700 of gross receipts from gold sold to purchasers\nlocated in New York State, but delivered to states other than New York\n\nState; * $100 of gross receipts from silver sold to purchasers\nlocated in New York State, but delivered to states other than New York State; and\n* $1,000 of gross receipts from electricity sold to\npurchasers located in\n\nNew York State and delivered to points within New\n\nYork. Corporation A incurred the following costs to acquire or\nproduce the commodities where the commodities are actually delivered: * $715 for gold; * $85 for silver; and\n* $400 for electricity. Corporation A uses the sourcing rule contained in section\n210-A(5)(a)(2)(I) and this section to determine the amount of net income (not\nless than zero) to include in its New York receipts or everywhere\nreceipts. Corporation A first determines the amount of gross\nreceipts from sales of commodities where the commodities are actually\ndelivered, which is $2,000 ($200 plus $700 plus $100 plus $1,000). Next, Corporation A determines the total cost it incurred to acquire or produce such\ncommodities, which is $1,200 ($715 plus $85 plus $400). The result is\n\nCorporation A has $800 of net income from sales of commodities that are\nactually delivered. The amount of net income from the sales of commodities\nactually delivered that is included in New York receipts is the net income from\nsuch sales multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of\ngross receipts from sales of commodities actually delivered to points within\n\nNew York State and the denominator of which is the amount of gross receipts\nfrom sales of commodities actually delivered. Corporation A multiplies its net\nincome of $800 by 60% ($1,200/$2,000), and the product is $480, which\n\nCorporation A must include in its New York receipts. All $800 of net income\nfrom sales of commodities actually delivered is included in everywhere\nreceipts. Sales of commodities where delivery does not actually\noccur. Corporation A has gains and losses from sales of commodities that are\nnot actually delivered in the following amounts: * $100 of gains from gold sold to purchasers located in\n\nNew York State; * ($200) of losses from gold sold to purchasers located\nin New York State; * $500 of gains from gold sold to purchasers located in\nstates other than New York State; * $ 400 of gains from corn sold to purchasers located in\nstates other than New York State; and\n* ($300) of losses from corn sold to purchasers located\nin states other than New York State. Corporation A first determines the amount of net income\nfrom sales of commodities that are not actually delivered, which is $500 ($100\n- $200 + $500 + $400 - $300). Next, it determines the amount of gains from such\nsales, which is $1,000 ($100 - $0 + $500 + $400 - $0). The amount of net income to be included in New York from\nthe sales of commodities that are not actually delivered is determined by\nmultiplying such net income by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount\nof gains from sales to purchasers located within New York State of commodities\nthat are not actually delivered and the denominator of which is the amount of\ngains from sales within and without New York of commodities that are not\nactually delivered. Corporation A multiplies its $500 of net income by 10%\n($100/$1,000). The result is $50 included in New York receipts. All $500 of net\nincome is included in everywhere receipts. Total sales of commodities. Corporation A includes $530 ($480 + $50) of net income\nfrom commodities in its New York receipts and $1,300 ($800 + $500) of net\nincome from commodities in its everywhere receipts. (b) (1)\n\nIn the case of a combined report, the\namount of net income (not less than zero) of the combined group from\ncommodities included in the combined group's New York receipts or everywhere\nreceipts is determined separately for sales of commodities actually delivered\nand sales of commodities where delivery does not actually occur. (i) The amount of net income (not less than\nzero) for all members of the combined group included in the combined group's\n\nNew York receipts from sales of commodities actually delivered is the product\nof such net income (not less than zero) and a fraction, the numerator of which\nis the amount of gross receipts from sales of all commodities actually\ndelivered to points within New York State for all members of the combined group\nand the denominator of which is the amount of all gross receipts from sales of\ncommodities that are actually delivered for all members of the combined\ngroup. (ii)\n\nThe amount of net\nincome (not less than zero) for all members of the combined group included in\nthe combined group's New York receipts from commodities where delivery does not\nactually occur is the product of such net income (not less than zero) and a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the amount of gains for all members of the\ncombined group from sales of commodities where delivery does not actually occur\nto purchasers located in New York State, and the denominator of which is the\namount of gains for all members of the combined group from all sales of\ncommodities where delivery does not actually occur. 100% of net income (not\nless than zero) from sales of commodities for all m embers of the combined\ngroup where delivery does not actually occur is included in the combined\ngroup's everywhere receipts. (2)\n\nNet income (not less than zero) is\ndetermined by subtracting the cost to acquire or produce all commodities from\nthe gross proceeds from the sale of commodities, provided the result cannot be\nless than zero. The cost to acquire or produce all commodities is the amount\npaid to purchase or produce the commodity. The cost to acquire or produce all\ncommodities includes the purchase price of commodities and all transaction\ncosts associated with the purchase of the commodities. (c) For purposes of this section, the term\ncommodity has the same meaning as in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of IRC\nsection 475(e)(2). (d) For rules\npertaining to sales of tangible personal property that is not traded as a\ncommodity, see section\n4-2.1\nof this Subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
