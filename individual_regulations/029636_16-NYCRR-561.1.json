Tit. 16 § 561.1 - Classification of utilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the\npurpose of applying systems of accounts prescribed by the commission, water\nutilities are divided into four classes, as follows: Class A. Utilities having annual water operating revenues\nof $1,000,000 or more. Class B. Utilities having annual water operating revenues\nof $700,000 or more but less than $1,000,000. Class C. Utilities having annual water operating revenues\nof $400,000 or more but less than $700,000. Class D. Utilities having annual water operating revenues\nof $100,000 or more but less than $400,000. (b) This system of accounts applies to Class\nA and B utilities. Those applicable to Class C and Class D utilities are issued\nseparately. (c) The class to which\nany utility belongs shall originally be determined by the average of its annual\nwater operating revenues for the last three consecutive years. Subsequent\nchanges in classification shall be made when the annual water operating\nrevenues for each of the three immediately preceding years shall exceed the\nupper limit, or be less than the lower limit, of the annual water operating\nrevenues of the classification previously applicable to the utility. (d) Any utility may, at its option, adopt the\nsystem of accounts prescribed by the commission for any larger class of\nutilities. Notice of such action shall be promptly filed with the\ncommission.
