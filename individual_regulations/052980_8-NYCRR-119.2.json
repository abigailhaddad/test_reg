Tit. 8 § 119.2 - Participation in public employee retirement systems\n\nState Regulations\nA charter school may elect to treat its instructional\nemployees or its non-instructional employees, or both, as private employees for\npurposes of retirement benefits or to have its instructional employees or its\nnon-instructional employees, or both, treated as public employees for\nretirement purposes in accordance with the provisions of this section. (a) A charter school shall be eligible to\nbecome a participating employer in a public employee retirement system\nparticipated in by the local school district in which the charter school is\nlocated. (b) A charter school\nseeking to become a participating employer in a public employee retirement\nsystem shall make application for admission to such system in the manner\nprescribed by such system. (c) Once\na charter school has been accepted as a participating employer by a public\nemployee retirement system, such participation may not be revoked by the\ncharter school. A charter school participating in a public employee retirement\nsystem shall bear all the responsibilities and obligations of a participating\nemployer in such system. Among other things, the charter school shall be\nresponsible for the timely collection of employee contributions and the timely\npayment of employer and employee contributions to the public employee\nretirement system. A charter school shall also maintain such records of service\nand compensation as may be required by the public employee retirement\nsystem. (d) Employees of a charter\nschool participating in a public employee retirement system shall be deemed\npublic employees for retirement purposes and eligible for admission to\nmembership in a public employee retirement system in which the charter school\nparticipates on the same basis as comparable employees of the local school\ndistrict in which the charter school is located. (e) In the event a charter school is admitted\nas a participating employer in a public employee retirement system after it has\ncommenced operation, the employees of the charter school may be credited with\nsuch prior service with the charter school as shall be certified by the charter\nschool to have been rendered to it and otherwise creditable in such system, provided and only to the extent the applicable employer and employee\ncontributions for such service with applicable interest as determined by such\nsystem have been paid to such system for such service. (f) For the purposes of section\n2855\nof the\n\nEducation Law, the material and substantial failure of a charter school to make\ntimely collection of employee contributions and to make timely payment of\nemployer and employee contributions to a public employee retirement system\nshall constitute fiscal mismanagement.
