  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 418-2.9 - Behavior management\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The program must establish and follow a\nwritten plan for behavior management that is acceptable to the office. This\nplan must include how the program will approach challenging behaviors, help\nchildren solve problems, and encourage acceptable behaviors. (b) The caregivers must use acceptable\ntechniques and approaches to help children solve problems. (c) The program must provide copies of the\nbehavior management plan to all caregivers and parents of children in care at\nthe program. (d) Discipline must\npromote positive self-esteem in children and guide children in such a way as to\nhelp each child develop self-control and assume responsibility for his or her\nactions through clear and consistent rules and limits appropriate to the ages\nand development of the children in care. (e) Any discipline used must relate to the\nchild's action and be handled without prolonged delay on the part of the\ncaregiver so that the child is aware of the relationship between his or her\nactions and the consequences of those actions. (f) Isolating a child in a closet, darkened\narea, or any area where the child cannot be seen and supervised by the\ncaregiver is prohibited. (g) When a\nchild's behavior harms or is likely to result in harm to the child, others or\nproperty, or seriously disrupts or is likely to seriously disrupt group\ninteraction, the child may be separated briefly from the group, but only for as\nlong as is necessary for the child to regain enough self-control to rejoin the\ngroup. The child must be placed in an area where he or she is in the view of, and can be supervised and supported by a caregiver. Interaction between a\ncaregiver and the child must take place immediately following the separation to\nguide the child toward appropriate group behavior. Separation of a child from\nthe group in a manner other than that provided for herein is\nprohibited. (h) Physical restraint\nis prohibited. Physical restraint is the act of using force to extremely limit\na child's body movements for a lengthy period of time. It involves holding a\nchild against his/her will and putting pressure on the child's chest and/or\nextremities in an effort to significantly restrict his/her movement, thereby\nmaking it extremely difficult for a child to move. It may also involve holding\na child flat on the ground and restricting his/her body from\nmovement. (i) Physical intervention\nis permitted. Physical intervention is the act of using bodily contact as a\nshort- term immediate response to prevent children from incurring substantial\nor serious injury to themselves or injuring others. It may involve: picking a\nchild up and moving him or her away from danger or conflict, holding the\nchild's hands or gently touching the body to direct their movement, rocking a\nchild to soothe them, blocking a child's path when they are about to injure\nthemselves or others or destroy property. This technique allows the child to\nregain self-control as quickly and safely as possible. A consultation with a\nchild's parent is required if the child is not receptive to physical\nintervention. (j) Corporal\npunishment is prohibited. For the purposes of this Subpart, the term\ncorporal punishment\nmeans punishment inflicted directly on the\nbody including, but not limited to, physical restraint, spanking, biting, shaking, slapping, twisting or squeezing; demanding excessive physical\nexercise, prolonged lack of movement or motion, or strenuous or bizarre\npostures; and compelling a child to eat or have in the child's mouth soap, food, hot spices, irritants or the like. (k) Withholding or using food, rest or sleep\nas a punishment is prohibited. (l) A child may only be disciplined by a caregiver. (m) Methods of discipline, interaction or\ntoilet training which frighten, demean or humiliate a child are\nprohibited. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
