  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 763.5 - Patient referral, admission and discharge\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe governing authority shall ensure that decisions\nregarding patient referral, admission and discharge are made based on the\npatient's assessed needs and the agency's ability to meet those needs in a\nmanner that protects and promotes the patient's health and safety and does not\njeopardize the safety of personnel. Such decisions shall reflect a commitment\nto providing authorized practitioner ordered care and services while honoring\nthe patient's expressed needs and choices to the extent practicable and shall\nbe made in accordance with the provisions of this section. For the purposes of\nthis Part, authorized practitioner shall refer to a doctor of medicine, a\ndoctor of osteopathy, a doctor of podiatry or any other practitioner authorized\nunder Federal and State law and applicable rules and regulations to provide\nmedical care and services to the patient. (a) The initial patient visit shall be made\nwithin 24 hours of receipt and acceptance of a community referral or return\nhome from institutional placement unless: (1)\nthe patient's authorized practitioner orders otherwise; or\n(2)\nthere is written documentation that the\npatient or family refuses such a visit. (b) A patient shall be admitted to the agency\nafter an assessment, using a form prescribed or approved by the department, is\nperformed during the initial patient visit, which indicates that the patient's\nhealth and supportive needs can be met safely and adequately at home and that\nthe patient's condition requires the services of the agency. (1)\n\nIn determining whether a prospective\npatient's health and supportive needs can be met safely at home, the agency\nshall consider for admission a prospective patient who meets at least one of\nthe following criteria: is self- directing; is able to call for help; can be\nleft alone; or has informal supports or other community supports who are\nwilling, able and available to provide care and support for the patient in\naddition to the services being provided by the agency. For purposes of this\nsection: (i) a self-directing patient means\nan individual who is capable of making choices about his/her clinical care and\nactivities of daily living, understanding the impact of the choice and assuming\nresponsibility for the results of the choice, or has informal supports willing\nand able to provide advice and/or direction on behalf of the patient, if\nneeded, in accordance with State law; (ii)\na patient who is able to call for help\nmeans an individual who is physically, mentally and cognitively capable of\ninitiating effective communication to individuals outside the immediate\npresence of the patient who can provide timely assistance to the\npatient; (iii)\na patient who can be\nleft alone means an individual who, based on his/her physical, mental and\ncognitive capability, does not require the continuous presence of another\nindividual to meet his/her minimal ongoing health and safety requirements; and\n(iv)\ninformal supports or other\ncommunity supports means friends, relatives or associates of the patient, whether compensated or not, unaffiliated with the agency, who are able, available and willing to provide needed care, support and other services to the\npatient during the periods agency personnel are not present. Such supports may\ninclude personnel of an adult care facility in which the patient\nresides. (2)\n\nThe agency\nshall not be required to admit a patient: (i) who does not meet any of the criteria of paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision; (ii)\nwhen conditions\nare known to exist in or around the home that would imminently threaten the\nsafety of personnel, including but not limited to: (a) actual or likely physical assault which\nthe individual threatening such assault has the ability to carry out; (b) presence of weapons, criminal activity or\ncontraband material which creates in personnel a reasonable concern for\npersonal safety; or\n(c) continuing\nsevere verbal threats which the individual making the threats has the ability\nto carry out and which create in personnel a reasonable concern for personal\nsafety; (iii)\nwhen the\nagency has valid reason to believe that agency personnel will be subjected to\ncontinuing and severe verbal abuse which will jeopardize the agency's ability\nto secure sufficient personnel resources or to provide care that meets the\nneeds of the patient; or\n(iv)\nwho, based on previous experience with the delivery of care from the agency, is\nknown to repeatedly refuse to comply with a plan of care or others interfere\nwith the patient's ability to comply with a plan of care agreed upon, as\nappropriate, by: the patient; the patient's family; any legally designated\npatient representative; the patient's physician; agency personnel and/or any\ncase management entity, and such non-compliance will: (a) lead to an immediate deterioration in the\npatient's condition serious enough so that home care will no longer be safe and\nappropriate; or\n(b) make the\nattainment of reasonable therapeutic goals impossible; (3)\nthe assessment shall be\nconducted by a registered professional nurse, except in those instances where\nphysical therapy or speech/language pathology is the sole service prescribed by\nthe patient's physician and the agency elects to have the therapist conduct the\nassessment. (c) At the\ntime a determination is made to deny a patient admission based on the criteria\nlisted in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the agency shall determine whether\nthe patient appears to be eligible for services from the local protective\nservices for adults program in accordance with the criteria set forth in\nsection\n457.1(b)\nof\n\nTitle 18 NYCRR. (1)\n\nIf the patient appears to\nbe eligible for such services, the agency shall make a referral to the\nappropriate local protective services for adults program. Such referral shall\nindicate the patient's ongoing care needs and the reason for the decision not\nto admit. (2)\n\nIf the local\nprotective services for adults program accepts the referral, takes action to\naddress the problems preventing admission and notifies the agency that such\nproblems have been resolved, the agency shall reassess the patient to determine\nwhether admission has become appropriate or remains inappropriate. (d) Any patient who is assessed or\nreassessed as inappropriate for agency services shall be assisted by the\nagency, in collaboration with the discharge planner, the local social services\ndepartment and other case management entity, as appropriate, with obtaining the\nservices of an alternate provider, if needed, and the patient's authorized\npractitioner shall be so notified. If alternate services are not immediately\navailable, and the local protective services for adults program, the Office of\n\nMental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, the Office of Mental Health\nor other official agency requests that home care services be provided on an\ninterim basis, the agency may provide home care services which address\nminimally essential patient health and safety needs for a period of time agreed\nupon by the agency and the requesting entity, provided that the patient and\nfamily or informal supports, as appropriate, have been fully informed of the\nagency's intent to transfer the patient to an alternate service, when\navailable, and have been consulted in the development of an interim plan of\ncare. (e) Services which the agency\nprovides shall be available to all persons without regard to age, race, color, creed, sex, national origin, disability, service need intensity, location of\npatient's residence in the service area, or source of payment. (f) Services shall not be diminished or\ndiscontinued solely because of the change in the patient's source of payment or\nthe patient's inability to pay for care. (g) A discharge plan shall be initiated prior\nto agency discharge to assure a timely, safe and appropriate transition for the\npatient. (h) A patient may be\ndischarged by the agency only after consultation, as appropriate, with the\npatient's authorized practitioner, the patient, the patient's family or\ninformal supports, any legally designated patient representative and any other\nprofessional personnel including any other case management entity involved in\nthe plan of care. If the agency determines that the patient's health care needs\ncan no longer be met safely at home due to the circumstances specified in\nparagraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision, the agency must continue to provide\nhome health services only to the extent necessary to address minimally\nessential patient health and safety needs until such time as an alternative\nplacement becomes available and such placement is made or the patient or the\npatient's legal representative, who has the authority to make health care\ndecisions on behalf of the patient, makes an informed choice to refuse such\nplacement. As appropriate, the patient and family or informal supports, any\nlegally designated patient representative and any other professional personnel\nincluding any case management entity involved, shall be fully informed of the\nagency's intent to discharge the patient to an alternate service, when\navailable, and shall be consulted in the development of an interim plan of\ncare. Discharge shall be appropriate when: (1)\ntherapeutic goals have been attained and\nthe patient can function independently or with other types of community support\nservices; (2)\nconditions in the\nhome imminently threaten the safety of the personnel providing services or\njeopardize the agency's ability to provide care as described in subparagraphs\n(b)(2)(ii)-(iii) of this section; (3)\nall agency services are terminated by the\npatient; (4)\nthe patient, the\npatient's family, informal supports or any legally designated patient\nrepresentative is non-compliant or interferes with the implementation of the\npatient's plan of care and the scope and effect of such non-compliance or\ninterference: (i) has led to or will lead to\nan immediate deterioration in the patient's condition serious enough that home\ncare will no longer be safe and appropriate; or\n(ii)\nhas made attainment of reasonable\ntherapeutic goals at home impossible; and\n(iii)\nthe likely outcome of such\nnon-compliance or interference has been explained to the patient, or the\npatient's legally designated patient representative, family or informal\nsupports, and any case management entity, as appropriate, and the patient\ncontinues to refuse to comply with, or others continue to interfere with the\nimplementation of, the plan of care; or\n(5)\nthe availability of home health services\nor community support services is no longer sufficient to meet the patient's\nchanging care needs and to assure the patient's health and safety at home and\nthe patient requires the services of a health care institution or an alternate\nhealth care provider. An agency may determine that the patient's health care\nneeds can no longer be met safely at home by the agency if none of the criteria\nor circumstances of paragraph (b)(1) of this section apply any longer to the\npatient. (i) If a\npatient is to be discharged in accordance with subdivision (h) of this section, and the agency believes there will continue to be a substantial risk to the\npatient's health and safety subsequent to discharge, a referral shall be made\nto the appropriate local protective services for adults program or other\nofficial agency, as appropriate, at the time the discharge determination is\nmade. (1)\n\nIf the local protective services\nfor adults program or other official agency to which the patient has been\nreferred accepts the referral, takes action to address adequately the problems\nleading to the discharge determination and notifies the home care agency that\nsuch problems have been resolved, the agency shall reassess the\npatient. (2)\n\nAfter reassessment, the home care agency shall determine whether action to discharge the patient\nshould be discontinued or the discharged patient should be\nreadmitted. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
