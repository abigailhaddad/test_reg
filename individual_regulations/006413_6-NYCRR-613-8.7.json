(1)\n\nExcept as specified\nin paragraph (4) of this subdivision, the Commissioner of the Department will\nrequire the guarantor, surety, or institution issuing a letter of credit to\nplace the amount of funds stipulated by the Commissioner, up to the limit of\nfunds provided by the financial assurance mechanism, into the standby trust if: (i) (a) the\ntank system owner or operator fails to establish alternate financial assurance\nwithin 60 days after receiving notice of cancellation of the guarantee, surety\nbond, letter of credit, or, as applicable, other financial assurance mechanism; and\n(b) the Commissioner determines\nor suspects that a leak from an underground storage tank covered by the\nmechanism has occurred and so notifies the tank system owner or operator, or\nthe tank system owner or operator has notified the Commissioner pursuant to\nsubdivision\n2.4\n(e), section\n5.4, or Subpart 7 of this Part, of a leak from an underground storage tank\ncovered by the mechanism; or\n(ii)\nthe conditions of subparagraph (2)(i), or clause (2)(ii)(\na\n) or (\nb\n) of this\nsubdivision are satisfied. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner of the Department may\ndraw on a standby trust fund when: (i) the\n\nCommissioner makes a final determination that a release has occurred and\nimmediate or long-term corrective action for the release is needed, and the\ntank system owner or operator, after appropriate notice and opportunity to\ncomply, has not conducted corrective action as required under Subpart 7 of this\n\nPart; or\n(ii)\nthe Commissioner has\nreceived one of the following: (a) Certification from the tank system owner or operator and the third-party\nliability claimant(s) and from attorneys representing the tank system owner or\noperator and the third-party liability claimant(s) that a third-party liability\nclaim should be paid. The certification must be worded as follows, except that\nthe instructions in brackets must be replaced with the relevant information and\nthe brackets deleted: Certification of Valid Claim\n\nThe undersigned, as principals and as legal\nrepresentatives of [insert: owner or operator] and [insert: name and address of\nthird-party claimant], hereby certify that the claim of bodily injury [and/or]\nproperty damage caused by an accidental release arising from operating [owner's\nor operator\"s] underground storage tank should be paid in the amount of\n$[___].

(3)\n\nIf the Commissioner of the Department determines that the amount of corrective\naction costs and third-party liability claims eligible for payment under\nparagraph (b) of this section may exceed the balance of the standby trust fund\nand the obligation of the provider of financial assurance, the first priority\nfor payment will be corrective action costs necessary to protect human health\nand the environment. The Commissioner will pay third-party liability claims in\nthe order in which the Commissioner receives certifications under clause\n(2)(ii)(\na\n) of this subdivision, and valid court orders under\nclause (2)(ii)(\nb\n) of this subdivision.

(3)\n\nWithin ten\ndays after commencement of a voluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11\n(Bankruptcy), U.S. Code, naming a local government tank system owner or\noperator as debtor, the local government tank system owner or operator must\nnotify the Commissioner of the Department by certified mail of such\ncommencement and submit the appropriate forms listed under subdivision 8.6(b)\nof this Subpart documenting current financial responsibility. (4)\n\nWithin ten days after commencement of a\nvoluntary or involuntary proceeding under Title 11 (Bankruptcy), U.S. Code, naming a guarantor providing a local government financial assurance as debtor, such guarantor must notify the local government tank system owner or operator\nby certified mail of such commencement as required under the terms of the\nguarantee specified in 8.4(d)(10). (5)\nA tank system owner or operator who\nobtains financial assurance by a mechanism other than the financial test of\nself-insurance will be deemed to be without the required financial assurance in\nthe event of a bankruptcy or incapacity of its provider of financial assurance, or a suspension or revocation of the authority of the provider of financial\nassurance to issue a guarantee, insurance policy, risk retention group coverage\npolicy, surety bond, letter of credit, or state-required mechanism. The tank\nsystem owner or operator must obtain alternate financial assurance as specified\nin this Subpart within 30 days after receiving notice of such an event. If the\ntank system owner or operator does not obtain alternate coverage within 30 days\nafter such notification, they must notify the Commissioner of the\n\nDepartment.

(1)\n\nIf at any time after a\nstandby trust is funded upon the instruction of the Commissioner of the\n\nDepartment with funds drawn from a guarantee, local government guarantee with\nstandby trust, letter of credit, or surety bond, and the amount in the standby\ntrust is reduced below the full amount of coverage required, the tank system\nowner or operator must, by the anniversary date of the financial mechanism from\nwhich the funds were drawn: (i) replenish the\nvalue of financial assurance to equal the full amount of coverage required; or\n(ii)\nacquire another financial\nassurance mechanism for the amount by which funds in the standby trust have\nbeen reduced. (2)\n\nFor\npurposes of this subdivision, the full amount of coverage required is the\namount of coverage to be provided by section 8.3 of this Subpart. If a\ncombination of mechanisms was used to provide the assurance funds which were\ndrawn upon, replenishment must occur by the earliest anniversary date among the\nmechanisms. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
