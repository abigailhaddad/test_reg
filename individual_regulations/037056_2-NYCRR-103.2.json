Tit. 2 § 103.2 - General bidding requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nInvitations to submit bids must be issued\nto at least five manufacturers or distributors of products or materials meeting\nthe railroad company's general specification. If less than five invitations are\nissued, the reason for the limited canvass should be shown on the proposal\nform. (2)\n\nIn recognition of the\nfact that the railroad companies have adopted the products of certain\nmanufacturers as an inflexible standard for signal and related facilities the\n\nState will, in these instances, waive the requirements for competition, providing that the proposed purchase is a reproduction of a product of the same\nproducer, and accept a copy of railroad company's purchase order for such\nproducts. (3)\n\nIf the proposal of\nother than the low bidder is recommended for acceptance, a detailed explanation\nof the preference must be submitted by the Commissioner of Transportation. All\ntabulations must be accompanied by a copy of the proposal form, invitation and\nphotostatic copy of each bid and/or declination. (b) (1)\n\nPrices must be based on delivery at the nearest point of the railroad on which\nthe project is located and tabulation should show the estimated cost of\ntransportation (for each bidder) at the rate of not to exceed 10 mills per net\nton mile from such point to the site of project, or the published tariff rate\nfor that commodity. Specifically, the total for each bid should be adjusted to\nshow total net cost of materials f.o.b. job. (2)\n\nDelivery dates should be so arranged that\nmaterials will not pass through railroad stores, as the 15-percent overhead\nwill not be allowed on direct purchases. (3)\n\nMaterials purchased for specific State\nprojects shall be consigned to the State of New York, Department of\n\nTransportation, in care of the railroad, for the reason that the State will not\naccept billing for transportation taxes on such purchases. (4)\n\nIn issuing invitations to bid on these\nmaterials, the railroad companies should not be influenced by the fact that a\nmanufacturer is located on their own or affiliated lines. Invitations must be\nissued to any reputable producer or distributor of products meeting the\nrailroad company's general specifications. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
