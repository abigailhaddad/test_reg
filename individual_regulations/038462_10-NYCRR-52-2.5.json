(1)\n\nIf the department proposes to deny a license to a tissue bank or nontransplant anatomic bank, the bank shall be given written notice of the proposed denial, stating the reason or reasons for the denial. Such notice shall be sent by certified mail and shall be a final determination to be effective 30 days from the date of the notice unless reconsideration is requested pursuant to paragraphs (3), (4) and (5) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nDenial of a license shall preclude the applicant from operating a tissue bank or nontransplant anatomic bank in New York State, either directly or indirectly through any other person. (3)\n\nIf the department gives notice of proposed denial of a license, the applicant may request reconsideration of the proposed denial by submitting a written request for reconsideration to the department within 30 days of the date of the notice. Submission of a request for reconsideration within 30 days shall stay any action to deny a license, pending the department's decision regarding such reconsideration. (4)\n\nThe written request for reconsideration shall include all information the applicant wishes to be considered, including any written documentation which would controvert the reason for the denial or disclose that the denial was based upon a mistake of fact. (5)\n\nWithin 90 days of receipt of the request for reconsideration, the department shall review its initial determination to deny a license and shall issue a written determination after reconsideration.

(7)\n\nIn addition to any penalties provided under the Public Health Law and Penal Law, falsification or failure to make full disclosure on a license application shall be deemed to constitute, in itself, a bar to obtaining a tissue bank or nontransplant anatomic bank license in New York State.
