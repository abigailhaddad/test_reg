(b) The requirements of this section apply to joint life policies. The age limitation on continuation of term coverage for a policy which provides a death benefit at the death of the first of the joint insureds shall be based on the age of the oldest joint insured. The age limitation for a policy which provides a death benefit at the death of the last joint insured shall be based on the age of the youngest joint insured. (c) This section shall not apply to a joint life last to die policy if the term insurance component will be paid-up at age 100 based on a dividend scale interest rate two percent lower than the rate at the time of sale of the policy or such other rate approved by the superintendent. (d) Notwithstanding subdivision (a) of this section, under a permanent plan of insurance that consists of a cash value policy, a term insurance component and a paid-up additions component or similar variable life insurance benefits designed to provide for replacement of the term insurance component by the crediting of dividends or additional amounts, which purchase paid-up life insurance or similar variable life insurance benefits, the term insurance component may be continued after age 80 only on a level premium decreasing death benefit basis. However, if one of the exceptions set forth in subdivision (a) of this section applies, the term insurance component may also be continued on an increasing premium basis after age 80. (e) This section shall not apply to a permanent plan of insurance described in subdivision (d) of this section, if the ratio between the term insurance component and the base cash value component is no greater than one to one and the term component will be replaced by paid-up additions no later than the mid-way point of the premium paying period of the policy based upon the dividend scale existing at the time of sale or such other point in the premium paying period approved by the superintendent.
