  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2102.11 - Schedule\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The reasonable\ncosts that may be recovered for qualified major capital improvements (MCI) may\nnot exceed the recoverable costs, as determined by DHCR. In making such\ndetermination, DHCR shall refer to such reasonable costs as specified in the\n\nReasonable Cost Schedule found in Operational Bulletin 2020-1. The Reasonable\n\nCost Schedule shall provide the recoverable cost of MCIs that fall within the\nfollowing main three categories: 1. Major\n\nSystems; i. The maximum recoverable costs\nshall be presented for the following classes of work: (a) Plumbing; (b) Gas Repipe; (c) Wiring; (d) Windows; (e) Boiler/Burner; (f) Hot Water Heater; (g) Elevator Replacement; and\n(h) Elevator Modernization. 2. Façade, Parapet, Roof; i. The maximum recoverable\ncosts shall be presented for the following classes of work: (a) Façade; (b) Parapet; and\n(c) Roof. 3. Other Systems. i. The maximum recoverable costs shall be\npresented for the following classes of work: (a) Chimney; (b) Doors; (c) Security System; and\n(d) Intercom; and may include such other\nsystems as DHCR may determine. (b) Each class of MCI may list more detailed\ntypes of capital improvement work. Each class of MCI described in the Schedule\nmay be inclusive of additional cost that can be associated with the type of\nimprovements listed within such class. (c) The costs of each type of MCI work will\nbe listed as per unit, per unit of measurement or per piece of equipment as is\nappropriate given the nature of the improvement. (d) The maximum recoverable costs for each\ntype of MCI specified in the initial Reasonable Cost Schedule shall be based on\na survey of such construction costs undertaken for such installation. The maximum recoverable costs listed in the Reasonable\n\nCost Schedule shall be initially published and made available for public review\nand comment in conjunction with the promulgation process required for adoption\nof this regulation. (e) Periodic Review of Reasonable Cost Schedule\n\nEvery year after adoption of this regulation, DHCR shall\nconduct a new survey to assess the categories of major capital improvements, the classes of work within categories eligible for major capital improvements\nand the maximum recoverable costs listed for the types of MCI costs identified\nin the Reasonable Cost Schedule. (f) Procedure\n(1)\n\nWhen applying for a temporary MCI rent\nincrease, owners are required to submit an itemized list of work performed with\na description or explanation of the reason or purpose of such work. Costs may\nbe granted for related expenses that are not specified in the actual schedule, if they are found to be within or below the maximum costs for the class of\nwork, are necessary for the claimed improvement, and eligible for reimbursement\nas an MCI. Costs will not be granted for expenses which are ineligible for MCI\nrent increases. Only the actual amounts expended by owners for qualifying MCI\ncosts will be the basis for any temporary MCI rent increase. Qualifying owners\nwill, therefore, be awarded a temporary MCI rent increase on the lesser of\neither: (i) the actual amount expended, or\n(ii)\nthe maximum reasonable cost\nfrom the schedule, and such other additional items that are eligible as an MCI\nbut are not listed as part of the Reasonable Cost Schedule. (2)\n\nThe schedule provides a\nmaximum of costs that can be granted for eligible MCIs. All costs granted for a\ntemporary MCI rent increase must be actual, reasonable, verifiable, and meet\nall other regulatory requirements. (g) Waiver of Application of Reasonable Cost\n\nSchedule\n\nOwners may apply for a waiver of application of the\n\nReasonable Cost Schedule. Pursuant to the requirements specified below, such\napplication must demonstrate that: (a) the claimed costs underlying the\ntemporary MCI rent increase either: (i) are\nnot identified in the Reasonable Cost Schedule, or are necessarily and\nappropriately priced higher than those costs listed in the Reasonable Cost\n\nSchedule, and such costs are accurate and reasonable under the circumstances; or\n(ii)\nthat use of the Reasonable\n\nCost Schedule will cause an undue hardship and the use of alternative\nprocedures are appropriate to the interests of the owner, the tenants, and the\npublic, and the costs of such improvement are reasonable and accurate under the\ncircumstances. Owners must request a waiver of the use of the Reasonable Cost\n\nSchedule in writing and accompany the application with the information and\ndocumentation as specified in subparagraph (i)\n(h) Categories of Waiver\n\nAt the time of initial application for an MCI, an owner\nmay apply for, and the DHCR may grant, a waiver of application of the\n\nReasonable Cost Schedule where the owner meets any of the following\ncriteria: (1)\n\nNon-Landmarked Buildings\n(Buildings not designated by the Landmark Commission)\ni)\nA licensed engineer or architect must\ncertify that: a. The MCI costs for which the\nowner seeks a temporary MCI rent increase are accurate and reasonable under the\ncircumstances; and\nb. There is no\ncommon ownership or other financial interest between the contractor installing\nthe replacement or upgrade and the ownership entity of the owner; and\nc. A bid process was conducted and\nsupervised by a licensed architect or engineer. (2)\n\nLandmarked Buildings (Buildings\ndesignated by the Landmark Commission)\n\nAny eligible MCI work and the costs therefore were the\nresult of any law, regulation, rule, or requirement under which the premises\nhave been designated a landmark building. (3)\n\nCapital Improvement Work Performed While\n\nAlso Under Another Governmental Agency's Supervision\nDHCR will also accept the cost of contract where: (1)\nthe building is subject to both (a) the\n\nRent Stabilization Law, and (b) another housing program; and\n(2)\nthe contract is approved by or awarded\nunder the supervision of a state, city or local housing entity in conjunction\nwith that affordable housing program, and\n(3)\nsuch supervision includes a process by\nwhich such supervising agency reviews the costs to assure they are\nreasonable. (4)\n\nEmergency Capital\n\nImprovements\nDHCR will also accept the cost of contract where capital\nimprovements were performed to remedy an emergency condition and for which the\nowner paid more than the reasonable costs due to such emergency situation, but\nthe costs are actual and verifiable. (5)\n\nInterim Rules\n\nAn owner may apply for a waiver of application of the\n\nReasonable Cost Schedule if, prior to the effective date of this subsection\n(h), it has either entered a contract for the performance of MCI work within\ntwo years before final promulgation of this regulation, or submitted to DHCR an\napplication for a temporary MCI rent increase. The recoverable costs will be\ndetermined according to the Reasonable Cost Schedule and these provisions, but\nthe owner need not submit evidence of compliance with the bidding requirements\nset forth in subparagraph (i)(2); the owner may instead use alternative means\nof establishing the reasonableness of the MCI costs sought to be recovered as\ndirected by DHCR as part of the processing of such application. (6)\n\nFor pending MCI applications, an owner must make this waiver application within 60 days of the final\npromulgation of this regulation, unless in the context of processing the MCI\napplication the owner is directed by DHCR to submit an application for waiver\nat an earlier date. (i) Waiver Procedure\n\nAs part of the written Waiver application for\nnon-emergency capital improvements, owners must submit the following: (1)\nA certification by a licensed architect\nor engineer stating that: i)\n\nThe purchases\nand contracts, whose costs the owner seeks to recover have been awarded on the\nbasis of analysis and bidding to the fullest extent possible, but with no less\nthan three bidders having been solicited to perform the work unless the owner\ncan demonstrate that the work is so highly specialized that such bids cannot be\nextended; ii)\n\nList of items for\nwhich the owner solicited bids were necessary; iii)\n\nThe costs claimed by the owner for the\nMCI work are accurate and reasonable, provided that the architect or engineer's\nbasis for such conclusion is credibly supported; iv)\n\nAll changes to the original agreed upon\nscope of work were necessary to the underlying MCI and reasonably priced; and\n(v) The owner selected the\nlowest responsible bidder or the bidder best suited to perform the MCI work, provided that the architect or engineer's basis for such conclusion is credibly\nsupported. (2)\n\nCertification by owner that it has complied with bid process requirements\nincluding submission of: i)\n\nTabulation of all\nbids received; and\nii)\n\nCopies of\nall bids received; and\niii)\nA\ncertification by each bidder disclosing whether the owner or any board member, general partner, officer or employee of owner, and/or principal or employee of\nany managing agent retained by owner, has a direct or indirect interest in the\nbidder or in the compensation to be received by the bidder pursuant to the\nproposed contract. Failure to accurately and fully complete this certification\nmay result in the rejection of the bid for purposes of determining the owner's\napplication for waiver of the use of the Reasonable Cost Schedule, as well as\nrejection and a dismissal of the MCI application; and\niv)\n\nDetailed description of the items for\nwhich the owner initially solicited bids. (3)\nA certification by the owner's architect\nor engineer certifying the necessity, appropriateness, and reasonableness of\nthe costs of all changes to the original agreed upon scope of work that were\nperformed in connection with the MCI, along with a description of the changes\nin the scope, price, or time of completion of the work related to each change\norder. (j) For Emergency\n\nCapital Improvement MCI Applications\n\nThe owner must submit a statement from an independent\nengineer or architect describing the emergency, why the costs were greater than\nthose in the schedule, that the costs were reasonable for the situation, and\nwhy owner could not obtain three bids in a timely manner due to the exigent\ncircumstances. (k) Notice\n\nAs part of the MCI application process, any request by an\nowner for a waiver of application of the Reasonable Cost Schedule, shall be\nmade available to the tenants of the subject building(s) with an opportunity to\ncomment on and contest the waiver. (l) Denial of Waiver\n\nIf an owner's application for a waiver is denied, the\nowner's recoupment shall be limited to that required by the Reasonable Cost\n\nSchedule together with such other relief as may be appropriate. Approval of the\nwaiver does not assure that the application will be granted, that it will not\nbe modified, or that items submitted will not be disallowed, in whole or in\npart, as all other requirements and proof set forth in this paragraph must be\nmet. (m) Operational\n\nBulletin\n\nThe initial Operational Bulletin 2020-1, including all\namendments, shall be issued pursuant to this paragraph and Section\n2527.11\nof this Title.
