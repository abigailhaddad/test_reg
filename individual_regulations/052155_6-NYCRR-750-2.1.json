  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 750-2.1 - General provisions of a SPDES permit\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The SPDES permit, or a true copy, shall\nbe kept readily available for reference at the largest wastewater treatment\nfacility on site. (b) Upon issuance\nof a SPDES permit, a determination has been made on the basis of a submitted\napplication, plans, or other available information, that compliance with the\nspecified permit provisions will reasonably protect classified water use and\nassure compliance with applicable water quality standards. Satisfaction of\npermit provisions notwithstanding, if operation pursuant to the permit causes\nor contributes to a condition in contravention of State water quality standards\nor guidance values, or if the department determines that a modification of the\npermit is necessary to prevent impairment of the best use of the waters or to\nassure maintenance of water quality standards or compliance with other\nprovisions of ECL article 17, or the act or any regulations adopted pursuant\nthereto (see section\n750-1.25\nof this Part), the\ndepartment may require such a modification and the commissioner may require\nabatement action to be taken by the permittee and may also prohibit such\noperation until the permit has been modified pursuant to section\n621.14\nof this Title. (c) The provisions of a SPDES permit are\nseverable, and if any provision of the permit, or the application of any\nprovision of the permit to any circumstance, is held invalid, the application\nof such provision to other circumstances, and the remainder of the permit, shall not be affected thereby. (d) If the discharge(s) permitted in a SPDES permit originate(s) within the\njurisdiction of an interstate water pollution control agency, then the\npermitted discharge(s) must also comply with any applicable effluent standards\nor water quality standards promulgated by that interstate agency and as set\nforth in the permit for such discharge(s). (e) The permittee must comply with all terms\nand conditions of the permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation\nof the Environmental Conservation Law and the Clean Water Act and is grounds\nfor: enforcement action; for permit suspension, revocation or modification; and\nfor denial of a permit renewal application. (f) Where the permittee becomes aware that it\nfailed to submit any relevant facts in a permit application, or submitted\nincorrect information in a permit application or in any report to the\ndepartment, the permittee shall promptly submit such facts or corrected\ninformation to the regional water engineer. (g) It shall not be a defense, for a\npermittee in an enforcement action, that it would have been necessary to halt\nor reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the\nconditions of the permit. (h) The\nfiling of a request by the permittee for a permit modification, termination, transfer, or a notification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance, does not stay any permit condition. (i) The permittee shall furnish to the\ndepartment, within a reasonable time as set forth in the department request, any information that the department may request to determine whether cause\nexists for modifying, suspending, or revoking a SPDES permit, or to determine\ncompliance with the permit. The permittee shall also furnish to the department, upon request, copies of records required to be kept by the permittee. (j) Nothing in a SPDES permit relieves the\npermittee from a requirement to obtain any other permits required by\nlaw. (k) Discharges authorized by a\nSPDES permit as defined in section\n750-1.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart are deemed in compliance with titles 5, 7 and 8 of article 17 and the\nregulations promulgated thereunder.
