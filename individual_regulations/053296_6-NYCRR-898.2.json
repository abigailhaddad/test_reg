  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 898.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters Index Number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adapted\nfrom that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological\nsurvey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a\ndrainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name\nor an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Finger Lakes watershed and has been closely followed in connection with the\nidentification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of the stream\nnumbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams originally\nshown in older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the time of its\nsurvey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few\nstreams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the newer maps are\ndesignated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Finger Lakes drainage basin may be illustrated\nas follows: Waters Index\n\nNumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\n\nOnt. 66-12\n\nSeneca River\n\nFrom south, Seneca River converges with Oneida\n\nRiver at Three Rivers (H), to form Oswego River (section\n897.6\n). Ont. 66-12-52\n\nClyde River\n\nEnters Seneca River from west in the Montezuma\n\nWildlife Refuge (map J-13nw). Ont. 66-12-52-23\n\nGanargua Creek (south)\n\nEnters Barge Canal-Clyde River from south 0.1 mile\neast and 0.6 mile north of Village of Palmyra lines, respectively (map\nI-11sw). Ont. 66-12-52-23-33\n\nTrap Brook\n\nEnters Ganargue Creek from south and west between\ntribs. 33a and 34 (map I-10se). Ont. 66-12-52-23-33-1\n\nTrib. of Trap Brook\n1st trib. to enter Trap Brook from south (map\nI-10se). (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary\nand\nsubtributaries, respectively, shall mean any stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water\nwhich flows into any other stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond or other body of\nsurface water referenced by such waters index number; where tributaries or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface\nwater referenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and\nsubtributaries thereof, which are shown on the reference maps, unless\nexceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically designated\nwaters are generally known and which may appear on the reference maps. In cases\nof specifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to\nwhich the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I shall mean a brief\nindication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries\nmay include designations of segments or sections of waters to which a\nparticular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also\ninclude any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. (f) Map Ref. No. as appearing in table I means map reference number and indicates\none or more of the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in\npart, on which the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are\nshown. The following maps were produced from original maps which may be\nprocured through the Washington Distribution Section, Geological Survey. Map. Ref.

(h) Standards\nas appearing\nin table I, and denoted by the letters AA, A, B, C, or D opposite each\nspecifically designated waters shall mean the standards of quality and purity\nestablished for class AA, A, B, C, or D as the case may be, as set forth in\n\nPart 701, supra. The symbol (T) appearing after any standard\ndesignation shall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and that the\ndissolved oxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol\n(TS) after any standard designation shall mean that the designated waters are\nsuitable for trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen specification for\ntrout spawning waters shall apply thereto. (i) The term\ntrout\nas used\nin this Part means any fish in the following genera: \"Coregonus\", \"Oncorhynchus\", \"Prosopium\", \"Salmo\", \"Salvelinus\" and \"Thymallus\". (j) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich appear as lines to indicate natural waters on the reference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated in table I, shall be assigned the\nsame classes and standards of quality and purity as specifically designated\nwaters to which they are directly tributary. (k) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standards as the waters to which it is\ndirectly tributary. (l) The Finger\n\nLakes drainage basin shall be deemed to include the following areas: All lands\nand water areas, the natural surface water drainage from which is directly or\nindirectly tributary to the Finger Lakes. (m) Notwithstanding the items indicated in\ntable I which, in some instances, indicate assignment of classifications for\nwaters contained within the boundaries of the State-owned forest preserve lands\nand, therefore, controlled under the provisions of the\n\nState\n\nConstitution\nand the Conservation Law, such waters are hereby excluded\nfrom classification to the extent that any part of such waters may be located\nwithin the boundaries of the State-owned forest preserve land. All waters\nwithin 100 feet of the boundaries of the State-owned forest preserve lands\nshall have a classification of A and be governed by the rules and regulations\npromulgated by the Water Pollution Control Board.
