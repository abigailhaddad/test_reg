  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 4G.01 - Applications of Emergency-Vehicle Traffic Control Signals and Hybrid Beacons\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE the entire section. INSERT the following paragraphs: Support: 00A An emergency-vehicle traffic control signal is a\nspecial traffic control signal that assigns the right-of-way to an authorized\nemergency vehicle. Adherence to certain warrants and guidelines is necessary to\nprevent indiscriminate application, with resultant motorist disregard for\nwarranted installations. 00B While emergency signals make it easier for emergency\nvehicles to enter and proceed along highways, they can be disadvantageous for\nvolunteer personnel trying to reach an emergency vehicle facility. Volunteers\ntraveling to the facility are not permitted to proceed through red indications. Red indications on the highway approaches to an emergency vehicle facility and\ntheir attendant traffic queues may increase volunteers' response times. Option: 00C An emergency-vehicle hybrid beacon may be installed\ninstead of an emergency-vehicle traffic control signal under conditions\ndescribed in Section 4G.04\n\nGuidance: 00D An emergency-vehicle traffic control signal should be\nprovided only if there is a demonstrated need. Consideration should first be\ngiven to providing less sophisticated solutions (e.g., warning signs and/or\nflashing beacon assemblies) to operational problems. 00E The factors to be considered in determining the need\nfor an emergency-vehicle traffic control signal should include: vehicular\nvolumes and speeds; the number and timing of emergency vehicle movements; visibility of the emergency vehicles to approaching traffic; sight distance\nalong the highway at the point where emergency vehicles enter the roadway or\nintersection; and emergency vehicle accident experience. 00F The following warrants should be applied in considering\nthe installation of an emergency-vehicle traffic control signal: Two-lane highways. Emergency-vehicle traffic control\nsignals should be used on two-lane highways only where, within a two-year\nperiod, 200 emergency calls occur during times when the rate of flow on the\nhighway is at least: 750 vehicles per hour; or\n525 vehicles per hour, if the 85th-percentile highway speed\nis over 40 miles per hour; or\n525 vehicles per hour if the stopping sight distance for\nvehicles approaching on the major street is insufficient to permit reasonably\nsafe entrance of emergency vehicles; or\n375 vehicles per hour, if the 85th-percentile highway speed\nis over 40 miles per hour and the stopping sight distance for vehicles\napproaching on the major street is insufficient to permit reasonably safe\nentrance of emergency vehicles. Four-lane highways. Emergency-vehicle traffic control\nsignals should be used on four-lane highways only where, within a two-year\nperiod, 200 emergency calls occur during times when the rate of flow on the\nhighway is at least: 900 vehicles per hour; or\n630 vehicles per hour, if the 85th-percentile highway speed\nis over 40 miles per hour; or\n630 vehicles per hour if the stopping sight distance for\nvehicles approaching on the major street is insufficient to permit reasonably\nsafe entrance of emergency vehicles; or\n450 vehicles per hour, if the 85th-percentile highway speed\nis over 40 miles per hour and the stopping sight distance for vehicles\napproaching on the major street is insufficient to permit reasonably safe\nentrance of emergency vehicles. Support: 00G The stopping sight distance may be determined using the\n2004 AASHTO Policy, Stopping Sight Distance, Exhibit 3-1. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n4G.01\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
