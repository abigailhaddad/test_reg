(iii)\n\nThe child/children must be verified\nwith the social services district as active, sanctioned or inactive household\nmembers at the time of the safety net case closing. (iv)\n\nEligibility for TBA cannot be\nestablished subsequent to the safety net case closing. (3)\n\nEligible households as determined in\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision who have a member(s) participating\nin an employment program that provides wages that are funded or reimbursed, at\nleast in part, through a grant diversion program that diverts the household's\nentire family assistance or safety net assistance grant ($0 cash grant case)\nare considered to have left family assistance and/or safety net assistance for\nthe purpose of TBA eligibility. (b) Ineligible Households. Transitional SNAP\nbenefits must not be provided when one of the following conditions exists: (1)\n\nThe household is not in receipt of SNAP\nbenefits at the time of the closing; (2)\nA household member is not compliant with\na family assistance or safety net assistance requirement, and the State agency\nor social services district is imposing a comparable SNAP sanction; (3)\nA household member is currently in\nviolation of a SNAP work requirement; (4)\nA household member is currently\ndisqualified from participation in the family assistance program, the safety\nnet assistance program or SNAP for an intentional program violation; (5)\nA household's SNAP case is closing for\nfailure to comply with SNAP reporting requirements; (6)\n\nNo household member is eligible to\nparticipate in SNAP; or\n(7)\nA\nsafety net assistance household has not reported and verified the residence of\na child, as required by subparagraph (iii) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (a)\nof this section, at the time of the safety net case closing. (c) TBA Transition Period. The\nsocial services district provides five months of transitional SNAP benefits. (1)\n\nThe transitional SNAP benefits are issued\nto TBA eligible households for a period of five months following the closing of\nthe public assistance case even if it results in the shortening or the\nextending of a household's currently assigned certification period, unless: (i) A household has recertified for SNAP\nbenefits as a result of voluntarily reporting a change that resulted in an\nincrease in SNAP benefits; or\n(ii)\nA household has a member or members who begin receiving family assistance or\nsafety net assistance. This includes a household under a grant diversion\nprogram who begins receiving a cash grant. (2)\n\nAs provided in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, the TBA transition period will end after a household has been\nissued transitional SNAP benefits for a period of five months, except that: (i) for a household that recertifies for SNAP\nbenefits, as provided in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the household's TBA transition period will end the last day of the month\nimmediately preceding the first month of the new certification\nperiod; (ii)\nfor a household that\nhas a member who begins receiving either family assistance or safety net\nassistance, as provided in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, on or before the twentieth day of the month, the household's TBA\ntransition period will end no later than the last day of the month in which the\nhousehold member begins receiving such assistance; and\n(iii)\nfor a household that has a member who\nbegins receiving either family assistance or safety net assistance, as provided\nin subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, after the twentieth\nday of the month, the household's TBA transition period will end no later than\nthe last day of the month following the month in which the household member\nbegins receiving such assistance. (d) Calculation of Transitional SNAP\nBenefits. All transitional SNAP benefits will be calculated by removing the\npublic assistance income from the SNAP budget in effect immediately prior to\nthe closing of the public assistance case; all other budget factors will remain\nthe same. The SNAP budget then will be recalculated to establish the\ntransitional SNAP benefit amount. Transitional SNAP benefits will remain at the\nestablished level for five months, unless the household's TBA benefits are\ndiscontinued pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of this\nsection. (e) Reporting Requirements\nand Reporting Changes. (1)\nTBA households are\nnot required to report changes during the five-month TBA transition\nperiod. (2)\nTBA households may\nvoluntarily report changes. Only changes that will result in an increase in\nbenefits and that are authorized through a recertification of the household\nwill be enacted, except that for a TBA household that has a member of the\nhousehold leave and apply for and be found eligible for SNAP as a member of\nanother household, then the TBA case and benefit must be adjusted to reflect\nthe loss of the household member, without the TBA period being\nadjusted. (f) Recertification. (1)\nTBA households must\nrecertify for SNAP benefits in order to continue to receive SNAP benefits after\nthe five-month TBA transition period. (2)\nTBA households must be allowed to file a\nrecertification at any time during the five-month TBA transition period. (i) Only a client-requested recertification\nthat will result in an increase in SNAP benefits will be enacted to end the\nfive-month TBA transition period. (ii)\n\nThe increased SNAP benefits will be\nissued for the new certification period that will begin the month after the\nmonth in which the household completes all recertification\nrequirements. (iii)\n\nUnless\nconducted on the same day as the recertification filing date, client-requested\nrecertification interviews must be scheduled as soon as possible, but no later\nthan ten days prior to the end of the month following the month in which the\nrecertification is requested. (iv)\nTBA households that fail to appear for a scheduled interview must have their\ntransitional SNAP benefits continue until the end of the five-month TBA\ntransition period. (v) TBA\nhouseholds that request an early recertification, but fail to provide required\nverification or that report changes that would result in a decrease in SNAP\nbenefits, will continue to receive transitional SNAP benefits unchanged until\nthe end of the five-month TBA transition period. (g) Notice Requirements. At the\ncommencement of the TBA transition period, a notice must be issued advising the\nhousehold of the following: (1)\n\nThe amount of\nthe TBA benefits. (2)\n\nThe length of\nthe TBA transition period. (3)\nTBA\nhouseholds will receive the same TBA benefit amount until the end of the TBA\ntransition period. (4)\nTBA\nhouseholds are not required to report any changes until the recertification at\nthe end of the TBA transition period. (5)\nTBA households may report changes if\nincome decreases or if expenses or household size increase. (6)\nTBA households may request an early\nrecertification. (7)\nTBA households\nwith a member or members who begin receiving family assistance or safety net\nassistance lose eligibility for TBA. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
