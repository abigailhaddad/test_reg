  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 143.0 - Statement of policy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Subdivisions\n5 and 6 of section\n130\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law were added by chapter 794 of the Laws of 1967. Under\nsubdivision 6, the director of the Division of Classification and Compensation\nmay, subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, authorize payment\nof additional salary, hereinafter called a shift pay differential, to employees\nregularly assigned to work on a shift other than a normal day shift in given\noccupations under certain specified conditions. (b) The purpose of authorizing a shift pay\ndifferential is to enable the State to attract and retain competent personnel\nin occupations and in areas of the State for and in which wage practices among\nprivate and other nonstate employers warrant such action, without having to\nraise the basic salary for the occupation on a statewide scale and without\nhaving to establish a higher rate of pay than is generally paid in the State\nfor the same occupation. (c) A\nshift pay differential is not intended to be, nor should it be construed to be, a substitute for general salary adjustments. (d) A shift differential cannot be authorized\nsimply because the hours of employment are different from those which\nconstitute a normal day shift. (e) The law specifies that a shift pay differential shall be in addition to, and\nnot a part of, an employee's basic annual salary. (f) A shift pay differential may be\nterminated or changed by action of the director of the Division of\n\nClassification and Compensation, subject to approval of the Director of the\n\nBudget. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n143.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
