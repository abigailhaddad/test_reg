  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 690.7 - Fee-setting and financial reporting for day treatment facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Rates of\npayment made for day treatment services rendered to title XIX recipients shall\nbe at the levels set forth in the approved New York Medicaid State Plan. The\nrates shall be contingent upon Federal financial participation (FPP) and\napproval. (b) Reporting\nrequirements. (1)\n\nEach provider shall\nsubmit reports in accordance with the requirements of Subpart 635-4 of this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nEach provider shall\nreport on its cost report the amount of funded depreciation for each of its day\ntreatment programs and expenditures from funded depreciation for each of its\nday treatment programs. See clauses\n(d)(2)(ii)(\nd\n)-(\ne\n) and paragraph (e)(6) of\nthis section. (3)\n\nFor purposes of\nthis section a day treatment program shall be defined as budget-based if such\nprogram did not submit a 12-month cost report for either the January 1, 1988\nthrough December 31, 1988, or July 1, 1988 through June 30, 1989 cost-reporting\nperiod. Budget information shall include 12 months of projected units of\nservice in accordance with clause (e)(1)(i)(\nc\n) of this\nsection, a participant roster and a completed Developmental Disabilities\n\nProfile (DDP) for each participant. (4)\n\nEach agency operating a day treatment\nprogram shall submit, with its cost report, a listing of the persons who were\nenrolled in the program during the period covered by the cost report. (c) Allowable capital and\nutility costs. (1)\n\nGeneral conditions. (i) To be considered allowable, costs must be\nproperly chargeable to necessary care rendered in accordance with the\nrequirements of this Part and any applicable codes, rules, regulations and\nlaws. (a) Except where specific rules\nconcerning allowability of costs are stated herein or in Subpart 635-6 of this\n\nTitle, the Medicare Provider Reimbursement Manual, commonly referred to as\nHIM-15 shall be used to determine the allowability of costs. Said guidelines\nare published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Care\n\nFinancing Administration (HCFA). The HIM-15 document is available from: The HIM-15 document is available from: Health Care Financing Administration\n\nDivision of Communication Services\n\nProduction and Distribution Branch\n\nRoom 577, East High Rise Building\n6325 Security Boulevard\n\nBaltimore, MD 21207\n\nIt may be reviewed in person during regular business hours at\nthe: (1)\nNYS Department of State, 41\n\nState Street, Albany, NY 12207; or\n(2)\nby appointment at the NYS Office for\n\nPeople With Developmental Disabilities, Division of Revenue Management, 30\n\nRussell Road, Albany, NY 12206. (b) Where specific rules stated herein or\nHIM-15 are silent concerning the allowability of costs, the commissioner shall\ndetermine allowability of costs based on reasonableness and relationship to the\nprovision of care and generally accepted accounting principles. (c) As determined by the commissioner, expenses or portions of expenses reported by an individual day treatment\nprogram that are not reasonably related to the efficient and economical\nprovision of care in accordance with any applicable certification standards\nbecause of either the nature or amount of the item, shall not be\nallowed. (2)\n\nCapital costs. (i) Notwithstanding\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, in the case of any provider which has been\nnotified by OPWDD on or after July 1, 1986 that there is a preliminary\nreservation of State aid funds for a capital grant pursuant to Mental Hygiene\n\nLaw, section 41.18(c) or 41.23, the basis for computing depreciation on the day\ntreatment program which is the subject of the capital grant shall include the\nday treatment program's depreciable project costs which were funded with such\ncapital grant, provided that the provider has not repaid the entire principal\nowed on the real property of the day treatment program. If the depreciable\nproject costs are adjusted after audit, the basis for computing depreciation on\nthe day treatment program will be changed to such adjusted depreciable project\ncosts. Upon full repayment of principal, the basis for depreciation for the day\ntreatment program will cease to include the amount of the capital grant. Any\nprovider which receives such a capital grant shall enter into certain\nassurances with the OPWDD whereby the provider agrees that: (a) the difference between depreciation in\nthe fee attributable to the day treatment program's depreciable project costs\n(other than depreciation attributable to the provider's equity in the day\ntreatment program's real property at the time such property is put into use as\na day treatment program) and the principal which is repaid shall be deposited\nin an investment approved by the commissioner. The commissioner's approval\nshall be based on whether the investment is secure, bears interest, is liquid, and is appropriate to the purpose for which it is being made; (b) except as provided in clause\n(\ne\n) of this subparagraph, withdrawals from such investment\nshall be made only for the purpose of repayment of indebtedness owed on the\nreal property of the facility; (c) each withdrawal must be signed by the commissioner; and\n(d) if the provider ceases to operate the\nfacility as a day treatment program for persons with developmental\ndisabilities, or as any facility certified by OPWDD, it will repay to the OPWDD\nthe balance on deposit in the secure investment at the time of such cessation, including interest earned on the investment; (e) with the commissioner's approval based on\ncost savings, a provider may use withdrawals from the investment cited in\nclause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph for repayment of indebtedness\nowed on the real property of another facility which received a capital grant\nunder this subparagraph or under subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, or if\nthere is no such other facility which is mortgaged, for the repayment of\nindebtedness owed on the real property of another facility which is mortgaged\nunder the same mortgage as the facility; (f) depreciable project\ncosts\nshall mean those acquisition and construction costs of a day\ntreatment program which have been approved, either before or after audit, by\nthe New York State Office of the State Comptroller or by OPWDD's designee. Such\ncosts shall not include the cost of the land. (ii)\n\nNotwithstanding subparagraph (iv) of\nthis paragraph, any provider which has been notified by OPWDD before July 1, 1986 that there is a preliminary reservation of State aid funds for a capital\ngrant pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law, section 41.18(c) or 41.23, may apply to\nthe commissioner to have the basis for computing depreciation on the facility\ninclude the day treatment program's depreciable project costs which were funded\nwith the capital grant. Such application must be submitted to the commissioner\non or before December 31, 1986 on the forms prescribed by the commissioner. Such application shall be granted at the discretion of the commissioner upon a\nshowing that inclusion in the depreciation basis of the day treatment program's\ndepreciable project costs which were funded with the capital grant is necessary\nto the financial viability of the facility and will not impede the day\ntreatment program's efficient and economical operation. If the commissioner\napproved such application, the day treatment program's fee shall be revised\nretroactive to July 1, 1986 to include in the depreciation basis the day\ntreatment program's depreciable project costs which were funded with the\ncapital grant, and the provider shall enter into certain assurances described\nin subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. Upon full repayment of principal, the\nbasis for depreciation for the day treatment program will cease to include the\namount of the capital grant. If the depreciable project costs are adjusted\nafter audit, the basis for computing depreciation on the day treatment program\nwill be changed to such adjusted depreciation project costs. (iii)\n\nFor any real property transaction on or\nbefore December 31, 1985 resulting in a change of ownership, and resulting in a\ntransaction that is not an at-arm's-length transaction, as defined in clause\n(i)(\nb\n) of this paragraph, the historical cost of the asset\nshall be limited to the seller's net book value. (iv)\n\nRestricted funds are funds expended by\nthe day treatment program, which include grants, gifts, and income from\nendowments, whether cash or otherwise, which must be used only for a specific\npurpose as designated by the donor or grant instrument. Except as provided for\nin subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, restricted funds are to be\ndeducted from the designated costs when determining allowable capital costs. The commissioner may waive the provisions of this section at his discretion\nonly in those instances where the provider makes a reasonable demonstration\nthat the imposition of the requirements of this section would cause undue\nfinancial harm to the ongoing operation of the day treatment program. (v) Start-up costs\nare those\ncosts which are incurred from the period the provider receives approval\npursuant to the certification of need process for a facility to become a day\ntreatment program to the date the first individual is admitted. However, costs\nincurred during the period from the first admission to the effective date of\nthe initial Medicaid certification shall not be considered as start-up costs. (a) OPWDD will reimburse a facility for all\nallowable start-up costs incurred in the preparation of the facility during\nthat six-month period prior to the date of the first admission. The\ncommissioner may grant an extension of the six-month limit for good cause\nshown. However, under no circumstances shall a facility be allowed\nreimbursement of start-up costs for any period of time exceeding 18 months\nprior to the date of the first admission. (b) Allowable start-up costs may include, but\nare not limited to: (1)\npersonal service\nexpenses; (2)\nutility\nexpenses; (3)\ntaxes; (4)\ninsurance expenses; (5)\nemployee training expenses; (6)\nhousekeeping expenses; (7)\nrepair and maintenance expenses; and\n(8)\nadministrative\nexpenses. (c) Any costs\nthat are properly identifiable as organization costs or capitalizable as\nconstruction costs shall be classified as such and excluded from start-up\ncosts. (d) If all portions of the\nday treatment program's facility are prepared at the same time, start-up costs\nshall be accumulated in a single deferred account and shall be amortized from\nthe date of the first admission. However, if only portions of the day treatment\nprogram's facility are prepared (\ni.e., preparation of a floor\nor wing), start-up costs shall be capitalized and amortized separately. In\neither case, start-up costs shall be amortized over a period not to exceed 60\nmonths from the date of the first admission. (d) Fee-setting. (1)\n\nFor the purpose of setting the day\ntreatment fee, units of service shall include the total number of half-day\nunits of service (more than three hours but less than five hours), the number\nof full-day units of service (five hours or more) and partial day units of\nservice (such as in the amount of at least 11/2 hours but less than three\nhours). Units of service are billable in the above amounts based on a unit of\nservice per person per day. Billable services include the initial contact\nvisit, enrollment for completing a preliminary screening, and services for\nindividuals formally admitted to the day treatment program in accordance with\nsection\n690.5\nof this Part. (i) Units of service for the fee-setting\ncalculation shall utilize projected or actual units of service as follows: (a) For the April 1, 1991 through December\n31, 1991 fee-setting calculation, actual units of service shall be from the\n\nJanuary 1, 1988 through December 31, 1988 cost report, for facilities in Region\nII or III, including those programs in Region I designated or elected to a\n\nRegion II or III reporting year-end and fiscal cycle in accordance with\nsubparagraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section and excluding those programs in Regions\nII and III designated or elected to a Region I reporting year-end and fiscal\ncycle in accordance with subparagraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section. For the July\n1, 1991 to June 30, 1992 fee-setting calculation, actual units of service shall\nbe from the July 1, 1988 through June 30, 1989 cost report, for programs in\n\nRegion I, including those programs in Regions II and III designated or elected\nto a Region I reporting year-end and fiscal cycle in accordance with\nsubparagraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section and excluding those programs in Region\nI designated or elected to a Region II or III reporting year-end and fiscal\ncycle in accordance with subparagraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section. (b) For the January 1, 1992 through December\n31, 1992, April 1, 1992 through March 31, 1993, and July 1, 1992 through June\n30, 1993 fee-setting calculations, and thereafter, actual units of service\nshall be from the cost report, submitted in accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of\nthis section, two years prior to the period for which the fee is being set. For\nexample, for the fee period of January 1, 1997 through December 31, 1997, the\nunits of service shall be those reported on the cost report for the period of\n\nJanuary 1, 1995 through December 31,1995. For programs for which OPWDD has not\nreceived such cost report at the time of the fee-setting calculation, OPWDD\nshall utilize the units of service paid for through the Medicaid Management\n\nInformation System (MMIS), during the required cost report period. (c) Projected units of\nservice\nshall mean the estimated monthly attendance multiplied by the\nexpected number of days the program will be open for each month. This\ncomputation shall be made for each month and summed and annualized for the\nnumber of months in the fee period. Projected units of service will be used in\nthe absence of actual units of service from the cost reports required pursuant\nto clause (\na\n) or (\nb\n) of this subparagraph. Projected units of service will be required upon issuance of an operating\ncertificate for a new site or an amended operating certificate reflecting a\nchange in capacity. Projected units of service shall be utilized for\nfee-setting purposes until a full-year cost report, subsequent to the cost\nreport period in which the issuance of an operating certificate for a new site\noccurred, is used for fee-setting purposes. Projected units of service shall\nalso be utilized for fee-setting purposes until a full-year cost report, subsequent to the cost report period in which the change in capacity occurred, is utilized for fee-setting purposes. If the estimated units of service have\nnot been received by OPWDD by the date required, OPWDD shall utilize the units\nof service paid for through the MMIS, beginning with the program's initial\ncertification or the first full month since the change in certified capacity\noccurred. If the available MMIS units of service are for less than a 12-month\nperiod, they shall be annualized for fee-setting purposes. (2)\n\nFee base period. (i) For facilities in Regions II and III, excluding those facilities in Regions II and III designated or elected to a\n\nRegion I reporting year end and fiscal cycle in accordance with Subpart 635-4\nof this Title, the base period shall be from January 1st to December 31, 1988. (ii)\n\nFor facilities in Region\nI, including those facilities in Regions II and III designated or elected to a\n\nRegion I reporting year-end and fiscal cycle in accordance with Subpart 635-4\nof this Title and excluding those facilities in Region I designated or elected\nto a Region II or III reporting year-end and fiscal cycle in accordance with\n\nSubpart 635-4 of this Title the base period shall be from July 1, 1988 to June\n30, 1989. (iii)\n\nFor facilities in\n\nRegion I designated or elected to a Region II or III reporting year- end and\nfiscal cycle in accordance Subpart 635-4 of this Title, the base period shall\nbe January 1st to December 31, 1988. (iv)\n\nAll dollar amounts cited in this section\nshall reflect base period costs for the period of January 1, 1988 through\n\nDecember 31, 1988. (3)\n\nThe fee for day treatment facilities shall be a fixed amount plus operating, capital, and transportation component add-ons. The fixed amount and operating\ncomponent add-ons shall reflect base period costs and shall be subject to trend\nfactors pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subdivision. As appropriate, OPWDD\nshall apply trend factors to the fixed amount and each facility's total\nreimbursable operating components as determined by this section. Such trend\nfactors shall be applied only to the fixed amount and the operating components\nwith the capital and transportation components added to this result to utilize\nin calculating the final fee. (i) The\noperating component add-ons shall be case mix, case mix intensity, salary, staff training and utilities. Day treatment programs that have submitted cost\nreports that contain full year costs for the periods January 1, 1988 through\n\nDecember 31, 1988 and July 1, 1988 through June 30, 1989 shall also be eligible\nto qualify for either cap adjustment component add-on or an allocation\nadjustment component add-on. In addition, day treatment programs in Region II\nand III that participated in the salary enhancement plan pursuant to chapter 54\nof the Laws of 1988 shall also receive a salary enhancement cost adjustment\ncomponent add- on. Operating component add-ons shall reflect base year costs\nand shall be subject to a trend factor pursuant to paragraph (6) of this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nThe capital\ncomponent shall include property, equipment, and start up costs pursuant to\nparagraph (c)(2) of this section. The capital component will not be subject to\na trend factor. (iii)\n\nFor the April\n1, 1991 through December 31, 1991 fee period, day treatment programs in Regions\nII and III including those programs in Region I designated or elected to a\n\nRegion II or III reporting year-end and fiscal cycle in accordance with Subpart\n635-4 of this Title shall also receive an annualization cost component\nadd-on. (iv)\n\nEffective July 1, 1995, the fixed amount shall be $36.67. (v) The operating component add-ons shall be\ncomputed as follows. Such component add-ons shall be added to the fixed amount. (a) Case mix component. The developmental\ndisabilities profile (DDP) shall be administered to each person attending the\nday treatment program. The DDP may be reviewed in person during regular\nbusiness hours at the: (1)\nNYS Department of\n\nState, 41 State Street, Albany, NY 12207; or by appointment at the: (2)\nNYS Office for People With Developmental\n\nDisabilities, Division of Revenue Management, 30 Russell Road, Albany, NY\n12206. (a) Utilizing\nthe individual's adaptive, maladaptive, and health/medical DDP scores, each\nperson's scores shall be assigned as follows to its corresponding DDP\npercentile level. For facilities whose fee period is July 1st through June\n30th, this provision applies to the fee periods July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1996, and thereafter. For facilities whose fee period is January 1st through\n\nDecember 31st, this provision applies to the fee periods January 1, 1994\nthrough December 31, 1995 and thereafter. Corrected or updated DDP scores shall\nbe implemented in accordance with paragraph (7) of this subdivision. The total\nnumber of persons assigned to each percentile level shall be multiplied by the\ndollar amount associated with that percentile level. Total dollars for each\npercentile level shall be summed together and divided by the number of persons\nfor whom there are DDP scores.

The agency salary per FTE shall be equal to the total\nagency day treatment noncontracted personal service costs reported on the\nappropriate January 1, 1988 through December 31 1988 or July 1, 1988 through\n\nJune 30, 1989 cost reports divided by total reported agency day treatment FTE's\nand the result is multiplied by. 9533 in order to reflect a median day\ntreatment salary for each agency. The noncontracted personal service costs\nreported on the January 1, 1988 through December 31, 1988 cost report shall be\ninclusive of nine months of salary enhancement for programs that participated\nin the salary enhancement program of chapter 54 of the Laws of 1988. The agency\nsalary for programs defined as budget based will be adjusted to reflect the\nagency salary of other existing day treatment programs operated by the\nprovider. If the provider does not operate other day treatment programs, the\nday treatment agency salary shall be equal to the agency salary of ICF/DDs\nand/or community residences operated by the providers. Day treatment agency\nsalaries derived from other day treatment programs or ICF/DD and/or community\nresidence programs operated by the provider shall be adjusted by. 9533 to\nreflect median day treatment agency salary. Budget based programs will be\nconsidered to be in a deficit (I) in accordance with subclause\n(v)(\ne\n)(\n3\n) of this paragraph. If the provider\ndoes not operate other day treatment or ICF/DD programs, the agency salary per\nFTE shall be equal to the day treatment statewide salary of $16,799. (2)\n\nThe agency salary per FTE shall be\ncompared to the day treatment statewide salary of $16,799. (3)\n\nSurplus/deficit (I). A surplus/deficit\nanalysis shall be computed for each day treatment program that filed a 12-month\ncost report for January 1, 1988 through December 31, 1988 or July 1, 1988\nthrough June 30, 1989. The surplus/deficit analysis shall be computed using the\nactual units of service from the 1988 cost report and, as appropriate, either\nthe January 1, 1990 or July 1, 1990 day treatment fixed amount and operating\ncost components in effect as of October 1, 1990, detrended to the base period. The trend factor used to detrend Region I fixed amount and operating cost\ncomponents is 15.66 percent. The trend factor used to detrend Region II and III\nfixed amount and operating cost components is 13.65 percent. The detrended\nfixed amount and operating cost components shall be compared to the program\nspecific operating costs from the appropriate cost report so as to determine\nthe site specific surplus or deficit. The surplus or deficit derived from this\nanalysis shall be titled surplus/deficit (I). The surplus/deficit (I) shall not\nbe computed for sites defined as budget based except as assigned in subclause\n(\n1\n) of this clause. (4)\n\nSalary component add-ons in accordance\nwith the schedule identified below shall be added to fixed amount for each day\ntreatment site. (i) If the agency salary per\nFTE pursuant to subclause (\n1\n) of this clause is greater than\nthe 50th percentile of the statewide day treatment industry and the day\ntreatment program is experiencing a surplus (I) in accordance with subclause\n(\n3\n) of this clause, the salary component shall be\n$6.10. (ii)\n\nIf the agency salary\nper FTE pursuant to subclause (\n1\n) of this clause is greater\nthan the 50th percentile of the day treatment industry and the day treatment\nprogram is experiencing a deficit (I) in accordance with subclause\n(\n3\n) of this clause, the salary component shall be $6.10 plus\nthe amount of costs equal to the agency salary per FTE divided by the statewide\nsalary of $16,799 multiplied by $29.09, minus $29.09. The 21.2 percent fringe\nfactor is added to this amount. (iii)\n\nIf the agency salary per FTE pursuant\nto subclause (\n1\n) of this clause is greater than the 40th\npercentile or equal to the day treatment statewide salary of $16,799, the\nsalary component add-on shall be $6.10. (iv)\n\nIf the agency salary per FTE pursuant to\nsubclause (\n1\n) of this clause is equal to or greater than the\n30th percentile or less than the 40th percentile of the day treatment industry, the salary component add-on shall be $3.89. (v) If the agency salary per FTE pursuant to\nsubclause (\n1\n) of this clause is equal to or greater than the\n20th percentile or less than the 30th percentile of the day treatment industry, the salary component add-on shall be $2.37. (vi)\n\nIf the agency salary per FTE pursuant to\nsubclause (\n1\n) of this clause is equal to or greater than the\n10th percentile or less than the 20th percentile of the day treatment industry, the salary component add-on shall be $1.50. (vii)\n\nIf the agency salary per FTE pursuant\nto subclause (\n1\n) of this clause is less than the 10th\npercentile of the day treatment industry, the salary component add-on shall be\n$0. (f) Salary enhancement cost adjustment component add-on. The fixed amount for day\ntreatment programs that participated in the salary enhancement plan pursuant to\nchapter 54 of the Laws of 1988 during the period January 1, 1988 through\n\nDecember 31, 1988 and submitted a 12-month cost report for the same period, shall receive a salary enhancement cost adjustment component add-on. Budget\nbased day treatment programs in Regions II and III whose agency salary per FTE\npursuant to subclause (\n1\n) of this clause, is equal to the\nagency salary of other existing day treatment programs operated by the same\nprovider shall also receive the salary enhancement cost adjustment component\nadd-on. The salary enhancement cost adjustment component may be revised to\nreflect additional FTE's for programs that have experienced a capacity change\nresulting in the issuance of a new operating certificate. (1)\n\nThe salary enhancement cost adjustment\ncomponent shall be calculated as follows: (i) For day treatment programs in Region II, the total number of direct care and\nsupport FTE's shall be multiplied by 25 percent of $1,900 and increased by a\nfringe benefit factor of. 212 percent and divided by the units of service\npursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nFor day treatment programs in Region\nIII, the total number of direct care and support FTE's shall be multiplied by\n25 percent of $1,690 and increased by a fringe benefit factor of. 212 percent\nand divided by the units of service pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (g) Cap adjustment component add-on and\nallocation component add-on. (1)\n\nIn order to\ndetermine eligibility for either the cap adjustment component add-on or the\nallocation component add-on, a surplus/deficit analysis shall be computed for\neach day treatment program using operating fees determined in accordance with\nsubparagraph (iv) and clauses (v)(\na\n)-(\nf\n) of\nthis paragraph and the actual units of service from the 1988 cost report. Such\noperating fee revenues shall be compared to program specific operating costs\nfrom either the January 1, 1988 through December 31, 1988 or July 1, 1988\nthrough June 30, 1989 cost reports. The surplus or deficit derived from this\nanalysis shall be titled surplus/deficit (II). (2)\n\nDay treatment programs determined to be\nin a deficit (II) pursuant to subclause (\n1\n) of this clause\nthat received salary components in accordance with subparagraph (4)(ii) of this\nsubdivision shall receive a cap adjustment component equal to the deficit (II)\ndivided by the units of service pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nDay treatment\nprograms determined to be in a deficit (II) pursuant to subclause\n(\n1\n) of this clause, that received salary components in\naccordance with subparagraphs (4)(iii) through (vii) of this subdivision shall\nreceive an allocation component equal to $3.07. (vi)\n\nThe property and capital equipment\ncomponent add-on shall be equal to the amount of allowable capital costs as\ndefined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and Subpart 635-6 of this Title, divided by the units of service figure. At the onset of each fee period the\nOPWDD shall review the property and equipment component add-on for substantial\nmaterial changes and if said changes conform to the requirements of paragraph\n(c)(2) of this section and Subpart 635-6 of this Title, the property and\ncapital equipment shall be revised to reflect said changes. (vii)\n\nEffective July 1, 1996, there shall be\na separate transportation component add-on to the facility's fee. This\ncomponent add-on for each day treatment facility shall be determined using the\nfollowing methodology. (a) Using a\npayment/rate data sample from calendar years 1995 and 1996, the weighted\ntransportation average shall be calculated by dividing the aggregate\ntransportation payments by the aggregate transportation units of service on a\nfacility specific basis. One round trip shall equal one unit of service. (1)\n\nThe weighted transportation average for\neach day treatment facility shall be ranked among all day treatment facilities\nstatewide. (i) If a facility's weighted\ntransportation average is $11.16 or less, the weighted transportation average\nshall be held 100 percent harmless. (ii)\n\nIf a facility's weighted transportation\naverage exceeds $11.16, 40 percent of the weighted transportation average shall\nbe held harmless. (2)\n\nAfter deducting the 40 percent to be held harmless, the net weighted\ntransportation average for each site (\ni.e., the remaining 60\npercent of the weighted transportation average) shall be re-ranked. Based on\nthe new percentile rankings, a percentage offset shall be deducted from the net\nweighted transportation average. A facility's percentage offset shall be\ndetermined by locating its net weighted transportation average\n(\ni.e., the remaining 60 percent of the weighted transportation\naverage) in the following table. Percentile\n\nRank\n\nNet Weighted Transportation\n\nAverage\n\nPercentage\n\nOffset\n5 or <\n$0 - $7.25\n5\n6 to 9\n$7.26 - $8.12\n7.5\n10 to 29\n$8.13 - $10.19\n10\n30 to 49\n$10.20 - $13.31\n12.5\n50 to 59\n$13.32 -$13.79\n15\n60 to 69\n$13.80 - $14.00\n16.5\n70 to 79\n$14.01 - $14.96\n20\n80 to 84\n$14.97 - $15.76\n22.5\n85 or >\nOver 15.76\n25\n(3)\n\nThe amount remaining after the application of the percentage offset (the 60\npercent of the weighted transportation average reduced by the offset percentage\nin the table above) shall be added to the hold harmless amount to determine a\nfacility's modified weighted transportation average. (i) If the modified weighted transportation\naverage falls below $11.16, the modified weighted transportation average shall\nbe adjusted to $11.16. (ii)\n\nIf the\nmodified weighted transportation average exceeds $30, the modified weighted\ntransportation average shall be adjusted to $30. (4)\n\nThe modified weighted transportation\naverage shall be multiplied by the total to and from day treatment\ntransportation units and divided by the total day treatment units of service to\ncreate a day treatment transportation component add-on. This shall be a\nseparate component added to the day treatment fee. (b) If an agency currently providing day\ntreatment does not have to and from transportation payment/rate data available\nfor a particular facility for the period used to calculate the modified\nweighted transportation averages, or if an agency opens a new day treatment\nfacility, the modified weighted transportation average shall be equal to the\nlesser of the facility's budgeted amount for transportation based on the\ntransportation requirements of the person(s) to be transported to and from the\nday treatment facility or the average of the modified weighted transportation\naverages for all other day treatment facilities operated by the\nagency. (c) If an agency does not\ncurrently operate a day treatment facility, and opens a day treatment facility\nor if an agency does not have to and from transportation payment/rate data for\nany of its day treatment facilities for the period used to calculate the\nmodified weighted transportation averages, the modified weighted transportation\naverage shall be equal to the lesser of the facility's budgeted amount for\ntransportation based on the transportation requirements of the person(s) to be\ntransported to and from the day treatment facility or the average of the\nmodified weighted transportation averages for all day habilitation programs\noperated by the agency as described in section\n635-10.5\n(c)(2)\nof\nthis Title. (d) If the agency does\nnot currently operate a day treatment facility or day habilitation program, the\nmodified weighted transportation average shall be equal to the lesser of the\nnew day treatment facility's budgeted amount for transportation based on the\ntransportation requirements of the person(s) to be transported to and from the\nday treatment facility or 75 percent of the regional modified weighted\ntransportation average associated with transporting individuals to and from day\ntreatment facilities. The table below shows the regional modified weighted\ntransportation averages: Region\n\nAverage\n75 Percent of Average\n1\n$21.37\n$16.03\n2\n$21.17\n$15.88\n3\n$15.97\n$11.98\n(e) Agencies that operated only day habilitation programs prior to July 1, 1996, and opened a day treatment facility for the first time between July 1, 1996 and\n\nSeptember 3, 1996 shall receive a one time fee adjustment if the agency\nreceived 75 percent of the regional modified weighted transportation average\nfor day treatment transportation and is now receiving either the day treatment\nfacility's budgeted transportation amount or the average of the agency's day\nhabilitation modified weighted transportation averages. The one time fee\nadjustment shall be either: (1)\na one time fee\nincrease if the lesser of the need-based budgeted transportation amount or the\naverage of the agency's day habilitation modified weighted transportation\naverages is greater than 75 percent of the regional modified weighted average\nfor transportation to and from day treatment facilities; or\n(2)\na one time fee decrease if the lesser of\nthe need-based budgeted transportation amount or the average of the agency's\nday habilitation modified weighted transportation average is less than 75\npercent of the regional modified weighted average for transportation to and\nfrom day treatment facilities. (4)\n\nFor the January 1, 1991 to December 31, 1991 and the July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992 fee periods, and thereafter, the\nfinal fee shall be equal to the property and equipment component calculated in\naccordance with clause (3)(v)(\nh\n) of this subdivision plus the\ngreater of subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph. For January 1, 1992 to\n\nDecember 31, 1992 and the July 1, 1992 to June 30, 1993 fee periods, the final\nfee shall be equal to the property and equipment component calculated in\naccordance with clause (3)(v)(\nh\n) of this subdivision plus\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph: (i) for\n\nRegion I facilities and those facilities designated or elected to a Region I\nyear- end and fiscal reporting cycle, 99.5 percent of the fixed fee and\noperating components contained in the June 30, 1991 fee trended to the July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992 fee period. For Region II and III facilities and those\nfacilities designated or elected to a Region II or III year-end reporting and\nfiscal cycle, 99.5 percent of the fixed amount and operating components\ncontained in the December 31, 1990 fee trended to January 1, 1991 to December\n31, 1991 fee period. Trend factors shall be applied in accordance with\nparagraph (6) of this subdivision; or\n(ii)\nthe fixed fee and operating components\ndetermined in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subdivision trended to the\nappropriate fee period. The final fee for day treatment programs that did not\nhave a fee in effect on December 31, 1990 or June 30, 1991, shall be equal to\nthis fee. (iii)\n\nEffective July 1, 1996, there shall be an efficiency adjustment as described herein and applied\nas a reduction to the calculated operating component of the fee. (a) The efficiency adjustment shall be a\npercentage reduction based on the $10.12 associated with total agency and\nprogram administration in the fixed component of the fee. Except as provided\nfor in clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph, all cost and revenue\ninformation, used to determine the efficiency adjustment percentages, shall be\nbased on reported cost and revenue information for the calendar 1992 or 1992-93\ncost reporting year. Each provider shall be assigned a percentage value from\nthe table at subclause (\n3\n) of this clause, based on total\nprogram cost, a program surplus/deficit group designation and an administration\npercentage group designation. (1)\n\nDetermination of program surplus/deficit group. A determination shall be made\nas to whether each provider has a program surplus or deficit, for the combined\ntotal of all community residence and day treatment programs and all residential\nhabilitation and day habilitation services. Surplus/deficit shall equal gross\nrevenue (less any prior period adjustments) minus allowable costs. (i) For those providers with a reported\ndeficit, this deficit shall be considered the final deficit amount for the\npurpose of this calculation. (ii)\n\nFor those providers with a reported program surplus, a certain portion of that\nsurplus shall be exempted to establish an adjusted surplus. The adjusted\nsurplus shall be the reported surplus minus the exempt amount. Exempt amounts\nshall be determined as follows. For providers whose total program costs are: (A)\nless than $1 million, the exempt amount\nshall be $10,000; (B)\nbetween $1\nmillion and less than $3 million, the exempt amount shall be $22,500; (C)\nbetween $3 million and $7 million, the\nexempt amount shall be $35,000; (D)\nover $7 million, the exempt amount shall be $40,000. (iii)\n\nThe reported deficit or the adjusted\nsurplus shall be given one of the following designations used to determine the\nefficiency adjustment percentage in the table at the end of this section: (A)\nS2 if the adjusted surplus is equal to or\ngreater than $200,000; (B)\nS1 if\nthe adjusted surplus is from $20,000 to $199,999; (C)\nBE if the reported deficit is not greater\nthan ($19,999) or the adjusted surplus is not greater than $19,999 (BE - break\neven); (D)\nD1 if the reported\ndeficit is from ($20,000) to ($199,999); (E)\nD2 if the reported deficit is equal to or\ngreater than ($200,000). (2)\n\nDetermination of a calculated\nadministration percentage group. A determination shall be made of a provider's\ncalculated administration cost, where administration percentage shall equal the\nsum of agency administration plus the program administration divided by the\nresult of total operating cost minus the sum of capital costs, agency\nadministration and program administration. There shall be five group\ndesignations that express the calculated administration percentage as a\ndeparture from the average percentage for all provider agencies. Those\npercentages centered around the average are designated with the abbreviation\nAVG. There are also two group designations for percentages over the average, abbreviated OA2 and OA1 and two designations for under the average, abbreviated\nUA2 and UA1. These abbreviations appear in the table of percentages at the end\nof this section as well as in the following regional tables. Each provider's\nassignment to one of the five group designations shall be based on the\nprovider's calculated administration percentage, total program cost and elected\nor assigned region (refer to subdivision [a] of this section). Each provider's\nadministration percentage group designation shall be determined using the\nfollowing tables.

(ii)\n\nNew agencies operating day treatment\nprograms subsequent to the 1992 or 1992-93 cost reporting period shall be\nassigned the center cell value, i.e., AVG-BE, in the table\nfound in this subclause. (b) Providers may request that OPWDD use a\nmore recent cost reporting period, as an alternative to their 1992 or 1992-93\nreporting period, to determine the efficiency adjustment percentage as\ndescribed herein. Approval to use an alternative reporting period shall be\ngranted if, upon a fiscal review by the commissioner, it is determined that the\ncost report for the alternative reporting period more accurately reflects the\nprovider's current financial status. For the purpose of determining the\nefficiency adjustment percentage only, providers may submit corrections to\ntheir 1992 or 1992-93 cost report. Such corrections shall be certified by a\ncertified public accountant. Providers may request the use of an alternative\nreporting period or may submit corrections to their 1992 or 1992-93 cost report\nonly once. Such requests or corrections shall be made in writing and received\nby OPWDD by December 31, 1996. Providers shall also have until December 31, 1996 to notify OPWDD of errors made in calculating the efficiency\nadjustment. (5)\n\nThe final adjusted fee shall be equal to\nthe final fee determined in paragraph (4) of this subdivision, except as\nprovided below: (i) Day treatment programs in\n\nRegions II and III including those programs in Region I designated or elected\nto a Region II and III year-end reporting and fiscal cycle shall receive the\nannualization component add-on for the period April 1, 1991 to December 31, 1991. The annualization component add-on shall be equal to the difference\nbetween the fee in effect on March 31, 1991 and the April 1, 1991 final fee\ncalculated pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subdivision for the period January\n1, 1991 to March 31, 1991 divided by the units of service pursuant to paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision. The annualization component add-on shall be added to\nthe final fee determined in accordance with paragraph (4) of this subdivision, and the resulting fee shall be considered the final adjusted fee. (ii)\n\nEffective January 1, 1999, a cost of\nliving add-on may be included in the final adjusted fee. This add-on will be an\nincrease to the fee due to a 2.5 percent increase in salaries and salary\nrelated fringe benefits. Inclusion of the add-on is subject to a resolution of\nthe facility's governing body that funding received will be used solely to\neffect a 2.5 percent increase beginning with the lowest paid employees. To be\ndeemed reimbursable, both the resolution and an implementation plan must be\nsubmitted by the facility and approved by the commissioner. (iii)\n\nFacilities initially certified as day\ntreatment facilities on or after April 30, 1999 shall be deemed to have met the\nrequirements for an approved cost of living add-on described in subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph, and a corresponding factor shall be included in the\nfinal adjusted fee. (iv)\n\nEffective\n\nJuly 1, 2000, day treatment facilities may be eligible for a salary enhancement\nadd-on to be included in their final adjusted fee. This add-on will be an\nincrease to the fee to recognize the costs of a $750 annual salary increase per\nfull time equivalent, plus salary related fringe benefits, for direct care and\nsupport workers. Inclusion of the add-on is subject to the provider agency\nsubmitting a resolution of its governing body that funding received will be\nused to effect this salary increase. To receive the add-on the agency must\nsubmit the resolution and implementation plan to OPWDD and the commissioner\nmust approve them. (v) Facilities\ninitially certified as day treatment facilities on or after April 1, 2001 shall\nbe deemed to have met the requirements for an approved salary enhancement\nadd-on described in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, and a corresponding\nfactor shall be included in the final adjusted fee. (vi)\n\nEffective January 1, 2003, day treatment\nprograms may be eligible for a cost of living adjustment (COLA) add-on to be\nincluded in their final adjusted fee. This add-on is a three percent increase\nto the personal service portion of allowed reimbursement, for expenditures\nrelated to recruitment and retention of staff for the period of April 1, 2002\nthrough March 31, 2003. On or after January 1, 2003, eligible facilities will\nreceive an amount that they would have received if the COLA add-on were added\nto the final adjusted fee on December 1, 2002. The provider is required to\nsubmit to OPWDD a letter of attestation, signed by the executive director and\npresident or equivalent of the governing body, which details how the COLA is\nexpended. (vii)\n\nFacilities\ninitially certified on or after April 1, 2003 shall be deemed to have met the\nrequirements for an approved COLA add-on described in subparagraph (vi) of this\nparagraph, and a corresponding factor shall be included in the final adjusted\nfee. (viii)\n\nEffective April 1, 2005, costs incurred as a result of requests for criminal history record checks\nunder section\n16.33\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law and section\n845-b\nof the\n\nExecutive Law shall be allowable costs and shall be considered part of the\nfee.

(iii)\n\nRegions I, II, and III. (a) Effective January 1, 2006, facilities in\nall three regions may be eligible to receive a variable trend factor for\nemployee health care enhancement (HCE). (1)\n\nProviders are eligible to have a variable trend factor included in their fee if\nthey submitted a completed 2005 OPWDD survey on health care benefits for all\nfull- and part-time employees. (2)\n\nBased on a survey of providers, OPWDD determined a benchmark of health care\nbenefits offered to employees by providers. In September 2005, OPWDD notified\nthose providers if their health care benefits were at, above, or below the\nbenchmark. (3)\n\nProviders whose\nemployee health care benefits are below the benchmark may apply to OPWDD for a\nvariable trend factor to be effective January 1, 2006 and to be calculated as\nfollows: (i) For providers which reported on\nthe survey that no health care benefits are offered, OPWDD determined a\nvariable trend factor for each provider based on the total number of employees\nreported multiplied by $2,500, except that if there are any employees who were\nreported on the survey and to whom the provider chooses not to offer funding\nfrom the variable trend factor, the variable trend factor based on the total\nnumber of employees reported will be reduced by the number of excluded\nemployees reported multiplied by $2,500. The funding from this variable trend\nfactor must be used to establish employee health care benefits or to reduce\nemployee out- of-pocket health-related expenses. (ii)\n\nFor providers which reported on the\nsurvey that employee health care benefits are offered to some or all employees, OPWDD determined a variable trend factor for each provider based on the total\nnumber of employees reported multiplied by $325, except that if there are any\nemployees who were reported on the survey and to whom the provider chooses not\nto offer funding from the variable trend factor, the variable trend factor\nbased on the total number of employees reported will be reduced by the number\nof excluded employees reported multiplied by $325. The funding from this\nvariable trend factor must be used to enhance employee health care benefits or\nto reduce employee out-of-pocket health-related expenses. (4)\n\nEffective January 1, 2006, providers may\nreceive a variable trend factor that would have been received during the period\nof April 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005 if the variable trend factor\ndescribed in clause (\nc\n) of this subparagraph had been paid. Providers whose employee health care benefits are below the benchmark may apply\nto OPWDD for the variable trend factor as follows: (i) For providers which reported on the\nsurvey that no employee health care benefits are offered, no variable trend\nfactor for the period of April 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005 is\navailable. (ii)\n\nFor providers which\nreported on the survey that employee health care benefits are offered to some\nor all employees, OPWDD determined a variable trend factor for each provider\nbased on the total number of employees reported multiplied by $325, except that\nif there are any employees who were reported on the survey and to whom the\nprovider chooses not to offer funding from this variable trend factor, the\nvariable trend factor based on the total number of employees reported will be\nreduced by the number of excluded employees reported multiplied by $325. The\nannual allocation of $325 will be adjusted for the 21-month period of April 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005. Funding from this variable trend factor must be\nused to reimburse health care expenses paid by employees. (5)\n\nIn order to receive a variable trend\nfactor described in clause (\nc\n) or (\nd\n) of this\nsubparagraph, the provider must send to OPWDD a completed written application\nsubmitted in the form and format specified by the commissioner. (6)\n\nFunding from the variable trend factor is\ncontingent upon OPWDD's approval of the application. OPWDD will base its\ndecision on whether the application is complete; whether it complies with the\nrequirements of this subparagraph; and whether the application recognizes the\nprovider's lowest paid employees. OPWDD may request additional information\nand/or documentation as needed before approving the application. (7)\n\nPayment of the variable trend factor\ndescribed in clause (\nc\n) or (\nd\n) of this\nsubparagraph shall be subject to the provider submitting a resolution by its\ngoverning body that funds received will be used to implement the plans\ndescribed in the provider's approved application. To receive the variable trend\nfactor, the provider must submit the resolution and the commissioner must\napprove it. (b) Effective October 1, 2006, facilities are eligible for a trend factor of 2.8\npercent to the operating portion of the fee. This trend factor is for\nexpenditures related to the promotion of recruitment and retention of staff or\nto respond to other critical non-personal service costs during the period of\n\nApril 1, 2006 through March 31, 2007. In order to receive this trend factor, the provider is required to submit to OPWDD a letter of attestation, signed by\nthe executive director and president or equivalent of the governing body, which\ndetails how the trend factor monies are expended. Facilities initially\ncertified on or after April 1, 2007 shall be deemed to have met the\nrequirements for the letter of attestation required by this clause. (c) Employee health care enhancement\nII. (1)\n\nEffective January 1, 2007\nproviders may be eligible to receive a variable trend factor for health care\nenhancement II (HCE II). Provides must use these funds to establish or enhance\nemployee health care benefits or to reduce employee out of pocket health care\nexpenses. (2)\n\nIn order to receive\nthe variable trend factor described in this subdivision, the provider must have\nsent to OPWDD a completed written application by July 31, 2006, unless this\ndeadline was extended by the commissioner. (3)\n\nReceipt of the variable trend factor is\ncontingent upon OPWDD's approval of the application. OPWDD shall decide whether\nto approve the application based on whether the application is complete; whether it complies with the requirements of this subdivision; and whether the\napplication recognizes the provider's lowest paid employees. OPWDD may request\nadditional information and/or documentation, or revisions to an application, before approving the application. (4)\n\nThe variable trend factor for HCE II is\navailable at either $2,500 per employee or $425 per employee, as follows: (i) The variable trend factor at the $2,500\nlevel is determined by OPWDD based on the total number of employees included in\nthe provider's approved HCE II application multiplied by $2,500. Funding at the\n$2,500 level is available to providers which: (A)\nsubmitted an application for HCE II\nvariable trend factor at the $2,500 level; and\n(B)\ndo not offer health care benefits; and\n(C)\nwere insufficiently funded\nfor health care, as determined by OPWDD. Affected providers were notified by\nOPWDD of this determination. (ii)\n\nThe variable trend factor at the $425\nlevel is determined by OPWDD based on the total number of employees included in\nthe provider's approved HCE II application multiplied by $425. Funding at the\n$425 level is available to providers which: (A)\noffer health care benefits to some or all\nemployees and submitted an application for the HCE II variable trend factor at\nthe $425 level; or\n(B)\napplied for\nHCE II variable trend factor at the $2,500 level but received funding at the\n$2,500 per employee level pursuant to clause (\nc\n) of this\nsubparagraph; or\n(C)\nsubmitted an\napplication at the $2,500 level but have sufficient funding for health care, as\ndetermined by OPWDD. Affected providers were notified by OPWDD of this\ndetermination. (5)\n\nThe application submitted to OPWDD shall\ninclude plans for the expenditure of the HCE II variable trend factor in\nconformance with this subdivision. Such HCE II plans shall assure that all\nemployees included in the application are entitled to some benefit from HCE II, although the value per employee may be lesser or greater than $2,500 or $425\nper employee. Higher paid employees whose earnings exceed a salary cap\nestablished by the provider may be excluded from receipt of any HCE II funds if\nthese funds are reallocated to lower paid staff. (6)\nA provider approved to receive HCE II\nvariable trend factor pursuant to item\n(\nc\n)(\n4\n)(\nii\n) of this\nsubparagraph shall receive an amount that would have been paid if the HCE II\ninitiative had been implemented April 1, 2006. (7)\n\nPayment of the HCE II variable trend\nfactor shall be subject to the provider submitting a resolution by its\ngoverning body that funds received shall be used to implement the plans\ndescribed in the provider's approved application. To receive the variable trend\nfactor the provider must submit the resolution and the commissioner must\napprove it. (8)\nA fee revised by\nOPWDD pursuant to this subdivision shall not be considered final unless and\nuntil approved by the State Division of the Budget. (d) Effective June 1, 2007, facilities are\neligible for a trend factor of 2.3 percent to the operating portion of the fee. This trend factor is for expenditures related to the promotion of recruitment\nand retention of staff or to respond to other critical non-personal service\ncosts during the period of April 1, 2007 through March 31, 2008. From June 1, 2007 to March 31, 2008, facilities will be reimbursed operating costs that\nresult in a full annual trend factor of 2.3 percent as if the trend factor were\nreimbursed from April 1, 2007 through March 31, 2008. In order to receive this\ntrend factor, the provider is required to submit to OPWDD a letter of\nattestation, signed by the executive director and president or equivalent of\nthe governing body, which details how the trend factor monies are expended. Facilities initially certified on or after April 1, 2008 shall be deemed to\nhave met the requirements for the letter of attestation required by this\nclause. (e) Employee health care\nenhancement III. (1)\n\nEffective January 1, 2008\nproviders may be eligible to receive a variable trend factor for the health\ncare enhancement III (HCE III) included in their fee. (2)\n\nVariable trend factor. Based on a survey\nof providers' historical data as of January 1, 2005, OPWDD determined a\nbenchmark of health care benefits offered to employees by providers. Prior to\n\nSeptember 30, 2007, OPWDD notified those providers which OPWDD deemed eligible\nfor an HCE III variable trend at the benchmark level. Providers deemed eligible\nfor an HCE III variable trend below the benchmark level were mailed\napplications with instructions. (i) Providers\ndeemed eligible for the HCE III variable trend factor at the benchmark level\nshall receive an amount equaling 1.0 percent of the operating costs exclusive\nof any HCE III component contained in the fee in effect on January 1, 2008 net\nof any funding provided pursuant to item (\niii\n) of this\nsubclause. Providers which also operate programs and services eligible for the\n3.0 percent funding level increase under this Chapter may not receive this 1.0\npercent variable trend factor unless they have declined the 3.0 percent funding\nlevel increase in the eligible programs and services. Providers which receive\nthis 1.0 percent variable trend factor may not apply for the employee health\ncare variable trend factor described in item (\nii\n) of this\nsubclause. (ii)\n\nProviders deemed\neligible for the HCE III variable trend factor below the benchmark level may\napply to OPWDD to receive an amount equaling 1.0 percent of the operating costs\nexclusive of any HCE III component contained in the fee in effect on January 1, 2008 net of any funding provided pursuant to item (\niii\n) of\nthis subclause. (A)\n\nProviders shall use these\nfunds to establish or enhance employee health care benefits and/or to reduce\nemployee out-of-pocket health care expenses and/or to offset the portion of\npremium increases paid by the provider which exceeds the portion of the trend\nfactor or COLA applicable to those premium increases. Providers shall assure\nthat benefits resulting from this additional funding recognize their lower paid\nemployees. (B)\n\nIn order to receive\nthe variable trend factor described in this item, the provider must have sent\nto OPWDD a completed application and attestation received or postmarked by\n\nOctober 1, 2007, unless the deadline was extended by the commissioner. In the\napplication and attestation, the provider must have indicated its intended use\nof the funds; agreed to obtain a resolution by December 31, 2007 from its\ngoverning body authorizing such use; and agreed to maintain on file the\nresolution as well as records detailing the distribution of HCE III\nfunds. (C)\n\nFunding is contingent\nupon OPWDD's approval of the application and attestation. OPWDD shall decide\nwhether to approve the application and attestation based on whether it is\ncomplete and conforms to the requirements of this subdivision. OPWDD may\nrequest additional information or documentation before approving the\napplication and attestation. (iii)\nA provider approved to receive an HCE\nIII variable trend factor pursuant to item (\ni\n) or\n(\nii\n) of this subclause shall receive an amount that would have\nbeen paid if the HCE III initiative has been implemented April 1, 2007. (3)\nA fee revised\nby OPWDD pursuant to this clause shall not be considered final unless and until\napproved by the State Division of the Budget. (f) Effective August 1, 2008, facilities are\neligible for a trend factor of 3.2 percent to the operating portion of the fee. This trend factor is for expenditures related to the promotion of recruitment\nand retention of staff or to respond to other critical non-personal service\ncosts during the period of April 1, 2008 through March 31, 2009. From August 1, 2008 to March 31, 2009, facilities will be reimbursed operating costs that\nresult in a full annual trend factor of 3.2 percent as if the trend factor were\nreimbursed from April 1, 2008 through March 31, 2009. In order to receive this\ntrend factor, a provider which did not submit a Letter of Attestation for\n2007-2008 is required to submit to OPWDD a Letter of Attestation, signed by the\n\nExecutive Director and President or equivalent of the governing body, which\ndetails how the trend factor monies are expended. Facilities initially\ncertified on or after April 1, 2009 shall be deemed to have met the\nrequirements for the Letter of Attestation required by this clause. (g) From April 1, 2009 to March 31, 2010 the\ntrend factor shall be 0.00 percent for all facilities. (h) Health care adjustments (HCA) IV and V. (1)\n\nVariable trend factor. Effective November\n1, 2009, providers may be eligible to receive a variable trend factor for the\nhealth care adjustments IV and V included in their fees. (2)\n\nBenchmark providers and non-benchmark\nproviders. Based on a survey of providers' historical data as of January 1, 2005, OPWDD determined a benchmark of health care related benefits offered to\nemployees by providers. Prior to October 31, 2007, OPWDD notified those\nproviders which OPWDD deemed eligible for the HCE III variable trend factor at\nthe benchmark level. Providers eligible for HCE III variable trend factor at\nthe benchmark level are eligible for the HCA IV and HCA V variable trend\nfactors at the benchmark level. All other providers are eligible for the HCA IV\nand HCA V variable trend factors below the benchmark level. (3)\n\nFunding. (i) Providers eligible for HCA IV and HCA V\nfunding at the benchmark level. (A)\n\nThe\nvariable trend factors for HCA IV and HCA V for benchmark providers shall be\n1.0 percent of the allowable operating costs used in establishing the provider\nspecific fees. Each adjustment shall be applied sequentially to effect\ncompounding of the adjustments. (B)\n\nProviders which also operate programs and services eligible for the 3.0 percent\nfunding level increase under this Chapter may not receive these 1.0 percent\nvariable trend factor increases unless they have declined the 3.0 percent\nfunding level increase in the eligible programs and services. Providers which\nreceive these 1.0 percent variable trend factor increases may not apply for\nemployee health care funding described in item (\nii\n) of this\nsubclause. (ii)\n\nProviders eligible for HCA IV and HCA V funding below the benchmark level may\napply to OPWDD to receive the variable trend factors. (A)\n\nThe HCA IV and HCA V variable trend\nfactors for providers eligible for funding below the benchmark shall be 1.0\npercent of the allowable operating costs used in establishing the provider\nspecific fees. Each adjustment shall be applied sequentially to effect\ncompounding of the adjustments. (B)\n\nProviders shall use these funds first to offset health care premium increases. Remaining funds shall be used to establish or enhance employee health care\nrelated benefits and/or to reduce employee out-of-pocket health care related\nexpenses. (C)\n\nIn order to receive\nthe HCA IV and HCA V variable trend factors, the provider must have sent to\nOPWDD a completed application and attestation received or postmarked no later\nthan September 11, 2009 unless the deadline was extended by the commissioner. In the application and attestation, the provider must have indicated its\nintended use of the funds; agreed to obtain a resolution by October 31, 2009\nfrom its governing body authorizing such use; and agreed to maintain on file\nthe resolution as well as records detailing the distribution of HCA IV and HCA\nV funds. (D)\n\nThe variable trend\nfactor is contingent upon OPWDD's approval of the application and attestation\nbased on whether it is complete and conforms to the requirements of this\nsubdivision. OPWDD may request additional information or documentation before\napproving the application and attestation. (4)\n\nCatch-up provisions. Effective November\n1, 2009, benchmark providers which do not receive any HCA funding at the 3.0\npercent level and non-benchmark providers with approved applications shall be\neligible to receive additional funding for HCA IV in an amount that would have\nbeen received for the period of April 1, 2008 through October 31, 2009 if the\n1.0 percent variable trend factor had been implemented on April 1, 2008. Effective November 1, 2009 benchmark providers which do not receive any HCA\nfunding at the 3.0 percent level and non-benchmark providers with approved\napplications shall be eligible to receive additional funding for HCA V in an\namount that would have been received for the period of April 1, 2009 through\n\nOctober 31, 2009 if the 1.0 percent variable trend factor had been implemented\non April 1, 2009. Nothing in this subclause shall entitle a provider to receive\npayment for services which have not been provided. (5)\n\nConsolidation of HCE and HCA funds\neffective January 1, 2010. (i) Effective\n\nJanuary 1, 2010, the HCE I through III and HCA IV and HCA V variable trend\nfactors included in the fee shall be consolidated into a single discrete\namount. For purposes of determining this amount, OPWDD shall combine the HCE I\nthrough III and HCA IV and HCA V variable trend factors contained in the\ninitial fee in effect on January 1, 2010. OPWDD shall use this fixed amount as\nthe HCA variable trend factor for the fee periods beginning on or after January\n1, 2010. (ii)\n\nEffective January 1, 2010, with the consolidation of the health care adjustments, non-benchmark\nproviders shall use HCE I, II and III funds first to either offset health care\npremium increases and/or to maintain benefits that were established and funded\nwith previous HCE I, II and III receipts. Remaining funds shall be used to\nestablish or enhance employee health care related benefits and/or to reduce\nemployee out-of-pocket health care related expenses. Non-benchmark providers\nshall continue to use HCA IV and V funds first to offset health care premium\nincreases. Remaining funds shall be used to establish or enhance employee\nhealth care related benefits and/or to reduce employee out-of-pocket health\ncare related expenses. Health care enhancement/adjustment funds included in the\nfees for services delivered on or after July 6, 2011 shall be used by\nnon-benchmark providers for the purposes described in this item and/or for any\nother options that continue and/or enhance existing health care benefits and/or\nimprove the recruitment and/or retention of the provider's lower paid\nemployees. However, in using these funds accordingly, non-benchmark providers\nmay establish which priorities serve the needs of such employees. Additionally, on July 6, 2011, health care enhancement/adjustment funding shall be included\nin the reimbursable cost category of fringe benefits in the fee. (6)\n\nProvider's distribution of HCA\nIV and HCA V funds is subject to audit to ensure conformity with the\nrequirements of this paragraph and distribution of funds consistent with the\nprovider's approved application. (i) From April 1, 2010 to March 31, 2011 the\ntrend factor shall be 0.00 percent for all facilities. (j) Health care adjustments (HCA) VI. (1)\n\nVariable trend factor. Effective October\n1, 2010, providers may be eligible to receive a variable trend factor for the\nhealth care adjustment (HCA) VI included in their fees. (2)\n\nBenchmark providers and non-benchmark\nproviders. Based on a survey of providers' historical data as of January 1, 2005, OPWDD determined a benchmark of health care related benefits offered to\nemployees by providers. Prior to October 31, 2007, OPWDD notified those\nproviders which OPWDD deemed eligible for the health care enhancement (HCE) III\nvariable trend factor at the benchmark level. These providers are \"benchmark\nproviders\" and are eligible for HCA VI funding at the benchmark level. All\nother providers (\"non-benchmark providers\") are eligible for the HCA VI funding\nbelow the benchmark level. (3)\n\nFunding. (i) Providers eligible for HCA VI\nfunding at the benchmark level. (A)\n\nThe\nvariable trend factor for HCA VI for benchmark providers shall be 1.0 percent\nof the allowable operating costs used in establishing the provider specific\nfees in effect on April 1, 2010. (B)\n\nProviders which also operate programs and\nservices eligible for the 3.0 percent funding level increase under this Chapter\nmay not receive the 1.0 percent variable trend factor increase unless they have\ndeclined the 3.0 percent funding level increase in the eligible programs and\nservices. (C)\n\nProviders eligible\nfor funding at the benchmark level may not apply for HCA VI variable trend\nfactor funding described in item (\nii\n) of this\nsubclause. (ii)\n\nProviders eligible for HCA VI funding below the benchmark level may apply to\nOPWDD to receive the variable trend factor. (A)\n\nThe HCA VI variable trend factor for\nproviders eligible for funding below the benchmark shall be 1.0 percent of the\nallowable operating costs used in establishing the provider specific fees in\neffect on April 1, 2010. (B)\n\nProviders shall use these funds first to offset health care premium increases. Remaining funds shall be used to establish or enhance employee health care\nrelated benefits and/or to reduce employee out-of-pocket health care related\nexpenses. Health care adjustment funds included in the fees for services\ndelivered on or after July 6, 2011 shall be used by non-benchmark providers for\nthe purposes described in this subitem and/or for any other options that\ncontinue and/or enhance existing health care benefits and/or improve the\nrecruitment and/or retention of the provider's lower paid employees. However, in using these funds accordingly, non-benchmark providers may establish which\npriorities serve the needs of such employees. Additionally, on July 6, 2011, health care adjustment funding shall be included in the reimbursable cost\ncategory of fringe benefits in the fee. (C)\n\nIn order to receive the HCA VI variable\ntrend factor, the provider must have sent to OPWDD a completed application and\nattestation received or postmarked no later than August 13, 2010 unless the\ndeadline was extended by the commissioner. In the application and attestation, the provider must have indicated its intended use of the funds; agreed to\nobtain a resolution by September 30, 2010 from its governing body authorizing\nsuch use; and agreed to maintain on file the resolution as well as records\ndetailing the distribution of HCA VI variable trend factor funds. (D)\n\nThe variable trend factor is contingent\nupon OPWDD's approval of the application and attestation based on whether it is\ncomplete and conforms to the requirements of this subdivision. OPWDD may\nrequest additional information or documentation before approving the\napplication and attestation. (iii)\n\nEffective October 1, 2010, benchmark\nproviders which do not receive any HCA VI funding at the 3.0 percent level and\nnon-benchmark providers with approved applications shall be eligible to receive\nadditional funding for HCA VI variable trend factor in an amount that they\nwould have received if the HCA VI variable trend factor had been in effect for\nthe period from April 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010. Nothing in this item\nshall entitle a provider to receive payment for services which have not been\nprovided. (4)\n\nProvider's\ndistribution of HCA VI variable trend factor funds is subject to audit to\nensure conformity with the requirements of this paragraph and distribution of\nfunds consistent with the provider's approved application. (iv)\n\nWhere appropriate, the commissioner may use some combinations in whole or in part of the yearly\ncomponents to project cost data into the appropriate fee\nperiod. (7)\n\nThe\ncommissioner may make corrections or adjustments to the fees based upon the\nfollowing: (i) Errors which occurred in the\ncomputation of the fee. (ii)\n\nFinal\naudit findings made in accordance with subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (iii)\n\nThe day treatment\nprovider may request corrections to the fee within 90 days of receipt of the\nfee. Such requests for corrections are limited to errors in a cost report\npursuant to subparagraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section, corrections to the DDP, and corrections to the transportation component add-on pursuant to subparagraph\n(3)(vii) of this subdivision. If corrections to the DDP would result in an\nincrease to the final adjusted fee, the commissioner may independently review\nthe corrected DDPs. During the period when the commissioner is reviewing the\nprovider-submitted revised DDP data, both the raw score and the percentile\ncharts found in clauses (3)(v)(\na\n) and (\nb\n) of\nthis subdivision, in effect at that time, and that were used to calculate the\nfee for the prior fee period, shall be utilized for fee-setting purposes until\nthe commissioner's review is completed. Should the commissioner's review verify\nthe provider-submitted revisions to the DDP data, said revised DDP data shall\nbe utilized for fee-setting purposes retroactive to the first day of the fee\nperiod. The case mix component add-on and the case mix intensity component\nadd-on may be recalculated only if there is a 10-percent or greater change in\nparticipants resulting from either a change in certified capacity or a turnover\nin program participants, or a correction to the DDP score approved by the\ncommissioner. Day treatment programs must report to the Bureau of Rate Setting\nall participant change greater than 10 percent. (iv)\n\nAdjustment to actual units of service. (a) OPWDD may, upon request from a day\ntreatment facility, adjust the units of service used for the facility's\ncalculation for the prior fee period to actual units of service delivered\nduring such fee period. However, such adjustment will be limited to situations\nwhere the agency demonstrated it was in a deficit situation for the prior fee\nperiod and had, for reasons beyond its control, not been able to deliver the\nunits of service used to calculate the fee for the prior fee period. (b) The day treatment provider must request\nadjustments to the facility's actual units of service within 150 days of the\nfiscal reporting period for which said adjustment is sought. (8)\n\nAll fees, and any\ncorrections to fees shall not be considered final, unless approved by the\ndirector of the Division of the Budget. (9)\n\nFunded depreciation. (i) Applicability. Paragraph (6) of this\nsubdivision shall apply to all day treatment programs except those governed by\nsubparagraphs (c)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. Paragraph (6) of this\nsubdivision shall apply to day treatment programs which were governed by clause\n(c)(2)(ii)(\nd\n) or (\ne\n) of this section but\nwhich are no longer governed by either such clause because the provider has\nrepaid the entire principal owed on the real property of the day treatment\nprograms. (ii)\n\nEffective July 1, 1986, for any fee period during which the reimbursement attributable to\ndepreciation on a day treatment program's real property, excluding equipment, exceeds the provider's principal repayment obligations on indebtedness\nattributable to such real property, such provider shall fund depreciation by\ndepositing such difference in an interest bearing checking account or other\nsecure investment. If the provider operates more than one day treatment program\ngoverned by paragraph (6) of this subdivision the provider may maintain one\nfunded depreciation account for two or more day treatment programs. The\nprovider shall not commingle such funded depreciation account(s) with other\nmonies of the provider. The provider shall not be required to fund depreciation\nattributable to the provider's equity in such real property. The provider may\nexpend the funds in such account, including accrued interest, to retire all or\na portion of the indebtedness attributable to such real property, or for\nbuilding improvements and/or fixed equipment necessary to the day treatment\nprogram. (10)\n\nThe day\ntreatment fees in effect for the period March 29, 1991 through March 31, 1991\nfor Region II and III facilities and including those programs in Region I\ndesignated or elected to a Region II or III reporting year-end and fiscal cycle\nin accordance with Subpart 635-4 of this Title, determined in accordance with\nthe day treatment fee-setting methodology pursuant to this section in effect on\n\nMarch 28, 1991 shall remain in effect through March 31, 1991. The day treatment\nfees for the period March 29, 1991 through June 30, 1991 for Region I\nfacilities including those Region II and III facilities designated or elected\nto a Region I reporting year-end and fiscal cycle in accordance with Subpart\n635-4 of this Title, determined in accordance with the day treatment\nfee-setting methodology pursuant to this section in effect on March 28, 1991\nshall remain in effect through June 30, 1991. (e) Case mix methodology. (1)\nDDP factor scores shall be determined in\naccordance with subparagraphs (i) through (iii) of this paragraph.
