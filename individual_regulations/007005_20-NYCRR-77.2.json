  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 77.2 - Redemption of unused stamps\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 171, 475 and 476\n(a) The Department of Taxation and Finance\nmay redeem unused cigarette stamps lawfully in the possession of any person. Consequently, the department may buy back from licensed cigarette agents or\nformer agents: (1)\nunaffixed stamps for which\nthe agent no longer has a need or is no longer qualified to affix; (2)\nunaffixed stamps from the inventory of an\nagent in liquidation; (3)\nunaffixed\nstamps which have been so damaged as to be worthless or unfit for\nuse; (4)\nunaffixed stamps which\nhave been superseded by stamps of a newer design or denomination; or\n(5)\nany other unaffixed stamps in similar\ninstances where the department deems redemption appropriate. With the exception of duly appointed or licensed fiscal\nagents or agent banks, no person shall sell or offer for sale to other than the\ndepartment any stamp or stamps issued pursuant to article 20 of the Tax Law, except upon written permission of the Commissioner of Taxation and\n\nFinance. (b) The\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance will redeem unused stamps for the actual\namount of cigarette tax paid for such stamps provided an application for\nredemption is filed with the department within two years after the date that\nthe unused stamps were purchased or within the time provided for in section\n77.1\n(d)(2)\nof this Part. In no event shall an application for redemption be filed where\ncigarette tax stamps have been purchased on a credit basis pursuant to section\n74.2\n(c) of this Title and where such stamps have not been paid for in full. All unused\nstamps for which an application for redemption is filed must accompany the\napplication and such claim must be sent to the department by registered mail. However, where registered mail is not feasible because of the volume of the\nstamps to be redeemed, the department may arrange for receipt of the unused\nstamps in an alternative manner. (c) If the Department of Taxation and Finance\nis satisfied that unused stamps should be redeemed, it may, subject to audit by\nthe Comptroller, make a refund of the cigarette tax paid. No interest shall be\npaid by the department on such refunds. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n77.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
