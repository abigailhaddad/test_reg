  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-9.6 - Carryforwards in certain corporate reorganizations and acquisitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A \"separate return limitation year\" (SRLY) means any separate return year of a corporation. The carryforward of any NOL incurred by a corporation for any taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2015, is limited after a reorganization or merger by the same principles for the limitation of the carryforward of an NOL for Federal tax purposes as required under the provisions of IRC sections 381 through 384 and related regulations and any other section of the IRC or related regulations. NOLs arising in taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2015, and carried forward to a combined report from a SRLY may be used to reduce the combined group's apportioned business income only to the extent of the apportioned business income of the combined group attributable to the acquired loss corporation that carried forward the loss from the SRLY (SRLY limitation). (b) NOL carryforward that is subject to limitation under IRC section 382 and related provisions. If the corporation's Federal NOL carryforward is limited in a particular year under IRC section 382, the amount of NOL carryforward allowed for New York State purposes is similarly limited. The IRC section 382 limitation adjusted for New York is the product of the annual IRC section 382 limitation and the business apportionment factor for the current tax year. In addition, if the NOLD of the combined group is less than such annual limitation in a given tax year, the annual IRC section 382 limitation adjusted for New York in the next taxable year shall be increased by such excess. (c) The SRLY limitation described in subdivision (a) will not apply where there is an overlap with IRC section 382 as described in subdivision (b), if it would not apply for federal income tax purposes. (d) In the event the NOLs described in subdivision (a) or (b) of this section are from the same loss year as losses of the acquiring corporation, the amount of SRLY limited carryforward under subdivision (a) or the IRC section 382 limited carryforward under subdivision (b) shall be applied before applying any other NOL against the remaining business income of the combined group.
