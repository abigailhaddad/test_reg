  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-3.1 - Definition of entire net income (ENI)\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 208(9))\n(a) (1)\n\nEntire net income means total net income from all sources. The starting point\nfor the computation of ENI is Federal taxable income, which generally means\ntaxable income as defined in IRC section 63 (\"taxable income\"). After\ndetermining the amount of Federal taxable income, it must be adjusted by the\naddition and subtraction modifications as required by the provisions of section\n208(9) and, to the extent necessary, further described in this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n\"Federal taxable\nincome\" is presumed to be the same as\n(i) the\ntaxable income the taxpayer is required to report to the Internal Revenue\n\nService; or\n(ii)\nthe taxable income\nthat the taxpayer would have been required to report to the Internal Revenue\n\nService, if it had not made an election under Subchapter S of Chapter One of\nthe IRC; or\n(iii)\nthe taxable\nincome that the taxpayer, in the case of a corporation that is exempt from\n\nFederal income tax (other than the tax on unrelated business taxable income\nimposed under IRC section 511) but is subject to tax under article 9-A, would\nhave been required to report to the Internal Revenue Service but for such\nexemption; or\n(iv)\nthe income, gain, or loss that is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or\nbusiness within the United States, as determined under IRC section 882, in the\ncase of an alien corporation that under any provision of the IRC is not treated\nas a domestic corporation as defined in IRC section 7701. (v) For purposes of computing ENI, federal\ntaxable income must be determined without taking into account the minimum\namount of taxable income specified in IRC section 860E. (3)\n\nThe amount of any specific exemption or\ncredit allowed in any law of the United States imposing any tax on or measured\nby the income of corporations is not allowed in computing ENI. The income\nactually reported or the income actually determined for Federal income tax\npurposes is not necessarily the same as the taxable income that was required to\nbe reported for Federal income tax purposes under the provisions of the IRC. Generally, the determination of the Internal Revenue Service as to Federal\ntaxable income is followed, but it is not binding on the commissioner or the\ntaxpayer. (b) Each\ncorporation included in a Federal consolidated group must compute its Federal\ntaxable income for purposes of article 9-A as if such corporation had computed\nits Federal taxable income on a separate basis for Federal income tax purposes. Provided, however, in the case of a member of a selling consolidated group, as\ndefined in IRC section 338(h)(10), with respect to which an election under such\nsection 338(h)(10) has been made, Federal taxable income shall not include any\ngain or loss on the sale or exchange of stock of a target corporation that is\nnot recognized by virtue of such election, but only if such member files on a\ncombined report with such target corporation for the period including the\nacquisition date, as such term is defined in IRC section 338(h)(2). (c) Combined reports. In computing combined\nentire net income, the combined group will generally be treated as a single\ncorporation. All intercorporate dividends must be eliminated (except dividends\nfrom a DISC or a former DISC not exempt from tax under article 9-A or dividends\nfrom a captive REIT included in the combined report if the group is utilizing\nthe subtraction modification in section 208(9)(t). In addition, all other\nintercorporate transactions must be deferred in a manner similar to the United\n\nStates treasury regulations relating to intercompany transactions under IRC\nsection 1502. In computing combined ENI, contributions should be deducted and\nintercorporate profits should be treated in a manner similar to US treasury\nregulations for consolidation purposes. (d) ENI may be affected by a net capital loss\ncarried from another taxable year for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to\nIRC section 1212. (For the rules for calculating a capital loss and a capital\nloss carry back and carry forward for New York purposes, see Subpart 3-7 of\nthis Part). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
