  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 262.4 - Permitted defense-only coverages involving claims of legal liability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No policy may provide defense-only coverage for a legal liability of the insured if the legal liability may permissibly be covered under a policy of liability insurance in this State. (b) Legal services insurance may provide for the payment of defense-only costs in relation to a claim of legal liability where a liability insurance policy cannot provide coverage for the legal liability of the insured because the coverage is against public policy or otherwise not permitted under the Insurance Law, such as a claim relating to dishonest or fraudulent acts, intentional violation of statute, or the intentional gaining of profits to which the insured was not legally entitled. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n262.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
