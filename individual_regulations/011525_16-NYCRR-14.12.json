  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 14.12 - Meter reading and estimated bills\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Meter reading. (1)\nA utility must attempt to\nobtain an actual reading for every metered account, on a regularly scheduled\nbasis in accordance with its tariff. (2)\n\nAn attempt to obtain a reading from\neither the meter or from a remote registration device requires that a meter\nreader follow routine reading procedures and access instructions, if\napplicable. (3)\n\nUnless a customer\ndoes not have access to the meter or the customer will be unable to obtain a\nreliable reading, the utility must, at the time of any unsuccessful attempt to\nobtain an actual reading, leave at the premises or mail the customer a meter\nreading card. (b) Estimated bills. (1)\nA utility may render an\nestimated bill for a regular cycle billing period only when: (i) the utility has been unable to obtain\naccess to the meter; (ii)\ncircumstances beyond the control of the utility made obtaining an actual\nreading of the meter extremely difficult, despite having access to the meter\narea; provided, however, that estimated bills for this reason may be rendered\nno more than twice consecutively without the utility advising the customer in\nwriting of the specific circumstances and the customer's obligation to have the\ncircumstances corrected; (iii)\nthe\nutility has good cause for believing that an actual reading obtained is likely\nto be wrong; provided, however, that estimated bills for this reason may be\nrendered no more than once without the utility taking corrective action before\nthe rendering of the next cycle bill; (iv)\ncircumstances beyond the control of the\nutility prevented the utility from obtaining an actual reading; (v) an actual reading was lost or destroyed; provided, however, that an estimated bill for this reason may be rendered no\nmore than once without the utility taking corrective action; (vi)\nan estimated reading has been ordered or\nauthorized by the commission for a particular billing cycle; (vii)\nan estimated reading has been approved\nas the billing method consistent with the utility's tariff for the billing\nperiod; or\n(viii)\nan unmetered\ncondition was in existence during the period. (2)\n\nEvery estimated bill must be calculated\nin accordance with an established formula which takes into account the best\navailable relevant factors for determining the customer's usage. (c) No access procedure. (1)\nA utility must begin providing no access\nnotices as described in this subdivision with the next cycle bill issued after\nbills were estimated for a period of six consecutive months because of\nconditions listed in subparagraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. (2)\n\nThe no access notices and charges\ndescribed in this subdivision must be directed only to the access controller. In any case where the access controller is not the customer of the subject\naccount, a copy of these no access notices must also be sent to the customer at\nthe same time. (3)\n\nThe series of no\naccess notices is as follows: (i) the first\nnotice must advise the access controller that the utility will arrange a\nspecial appointment to read the meter if the access controller calls a\nspecified telephone number. Where the access controller is not the customer of\nthe subject account, the notice must begin by stating that the utility records\nindicate that the recipient is the party who controls access to the meter of\nthe customer, specifically identified as to address, part supplied, and account\nnumber, and that the utility has not been provided access to the customer's\nmeter as required; (ii)\nthe second\nnotice must advise the access controller that unless access to the customer's\nmeter is provided on the next meter reading date or a special appointment to\nread the meter is made and kept by the access controller before that date, a no\naccess charge will be added to the access controller's next bill and to every\nbill thereafter until access to the customer's meter is provided, but that no\ncharge will be imposed if an appointment is arranged and kept. The notice must\nadvise the access controller that the utility will arrange a special\nappointment for a reading of the customer's meter if the access controller\ncalls a specified telephone number; (iii)\nthe third notice must advise the access\ncontroller of the no access charge that has been added to the access\ncontroller's bill and that unless access to the customer's meter is provided on\nthe next meter reading date or a special appointment to read the meter is made\nand kept by the access controller before that date, another charge will be\nadded to the access controller's next bill. The notice must advise the access\ncontroller that the utility will arrange a special appointment for a reading of\nthe customer's meter if the access controller calls a specified number; and\n(iv)\nthe fourth and each\nsuccessive notice must advise the access controller of the no access charge\nthat has been added to the access controller's bill. (4)\nA no access charge as provided for in the\nutility's tariff must not exceed $25. (5)\n\nNo more than $25 per building or premises\nmust be added to any single bill of the access controller even though more than\none meter is located there. (6)\nA\nutility may, at its discretion, suspend temporarily the issuance of no access\nnotices and/or penalties under this subdivision if the access controller\ncontacts the utility and provides a legitimate reason for postponing the\nprovision of access. (7)\n\nNothing in\nthis subdivision prevents a utility from sending appropriate no access notices\nto the party who controls access but does not have an active account of its own\nwith the utility.
