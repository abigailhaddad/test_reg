  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 658.12 - Request for stipulation of facts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) At any time after the service of the notice of hearing and the joining of\nissue, the hearing officer or any party may demand either on the record at the\nhearing or by motion in writing in advance of the hearing, that the opposing\nparty stipulate as to facts not in dispute or which fairly should not be in\ndispute. (b) If the opposing party\nrefuses without reasonable and just cause to stipulate as to facts not in\ndispute or which fairly should not be in dispute, the facts and evidence of the\nproposed stipulation shall be shown with particularity and by numbered\nparagraphs. The request or motion shall contain adequate references to the\nsources of the matter set forth, and where such sources are in the possession\nof the moving party or under his control, the motion shall also show that the\nopposing party has had and has reasonable access thereto. Where there is\ndisagreement with respect to any paragraph, either in whole or in part, or\nwhere the disagreement takes the form merely of a variance in the statement of\nthe facts or evidence, the response shall show the basis for the disagreement\nincluding references to pertinent sources. Where the truth and authenticity of\nfacts or evidence is not disputed, an objection on the ground of materiality or\nrelevance may be noted but is not to be regarded as just cause for refusal to\nstipulate. Where motion is made in writing, proof of service of the moving\npapers and response shall be submitted with the original papers to the hearing\nofficer. (c) The hearing officer\nshall consider the request for stipulation of facts and the response thereto, and shall rule on such motion or request in respect to whether the facts and\nevidence covered in said request or motion should not be accepted as\nestablished for the purposes of the hearing.
