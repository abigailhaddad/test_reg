(p) Project. The\nconstruction of the whole or connected portion of a sewage collection system. Where the construction of a sewage collection system is phased over a period of\nyears, each phase may be considered as a project. (q) Eligible project. A project which in the\njudgment of the commissioner meets all of the following requirements: (1)\n\nIt is in accord with applicable\ncomprehensive studies and reports made pursuant to section 1263-a, article 12\nof the Public Health Law, (2)\n\nIt\nconforms to applicable rules and regulations of the commissioner and, in his\nopinion, reflects a reasonable effort to develop maximum economy in planning, design and construction, with an acceptable ratio between costs and\nbenefits, (3)\n\nIt is necessary for\nthe accomplishment of the State water pollution control program, (4)\n\nIt is under construction in the period\nbetween April 1, 1965 and March 31, 1973, (5)\n\nNo portion of the project aided herein is\neligible to receive assistance pursuant to section 1263-b of the Public Health\n\nLaw, (6)\n\nIt serves inhabited\nresidences in existence prior to July 6, 1971, (7)\n\nIt serves the public by providing for the\ncollection of sewage (house connections and pipes collecting exclusively\nindustrial, commercial and other nonresidential waste are\nineligible). (r) Capital\ncost. The actual cost of construction of an eligible project, not to include\nthe cost of securing financing or interest on funds borrowed to finance such\nconstruction, and representing that part of the cost of the eligible project\nthat is not paid by the Federal government. (s) Annual debt service. Such amounts as\nshall be required to be paid annually to amortize obligations (both principal\nand interest) issued in order to finance the capital cost of an eligible\nproject; provided, however, that for the purposes of State aid, such annual\ndebt service shall be computed on a debt amortization schedule of not less than\n30 years nor more than 40 years, as the commissioner shall determine, and shall\nnot include any other debt service (whether principal or interest) on\nobligations of or on behalf of a municipality, other capital costs, or\nexpenditures for a purpose as to which State reimbursement is claimed under any\nprovision of law other than section 1263-d of the Public Health Law. Where the\neligible portion of the sewage collection system serves nonresidential users as\nwell as residences, the amount of annual debt service to be used in computing\n\nState aid shall be reduced as determined by the commissioner, to compensate for\nthe benefits received by the nonresidential users from such system. Benefits\nshall be based on proportion of the volume of flow contributed to the sewage\ncollection system, or other means acceptable to the commissioner. (1)\n\nWhere the municipality issues bonds to\namortize the capital costs of the project over a period of 30 to 40 years, the\nannual debt service to be used in determining State aid shall be in accordance\nwith the actual bond maturity schedule with the annual debt service adjusted in\nthe same proportion as the eligible capital cost for the project as determined\nby the commissioner is to the principal amount of the bonds as\nissued.

(t) State aid. Financial support made available to a municipality by way of State\nparticipation in annual debt service, through contracts entered into between\nthe commissioner and the municipality, upon such terms and conditions as the\ncommissioner shall deem appropriate, which shall be based on the number of\nresidences served by the eligible project and computed as follows: (1)\n\nThe amount of annual debt service, as\ndefined above, minus the municipality's share of the expense for construction\nof the sewage collection system. (2)\n\nThe municipality's share shall be the\nproduct of the number of residential sewer connections served by the project\nmultiplied by an adjusted rate. The adjusted rate shall be determined by\napplying a valuation correction from the sum of $125. (3)\n\nValuation correction shall consist of\nminus one dollar for each $1000 or part thereof that the project area per\ncapita full value is less than the average per capita full value for the State\nexcluding all cities. For projects wholly located within a village or town the\nproject area per capita full value shall be the per capita full value for the\nvillage, or for the town outside the village area respectively. For other\nprojects, per capita full value shall be per capita full value of the town or\nvillage within which the major portion of the project is located. Per capita\nfull value shall mean the full value of such municipality or area divided by\nthe population thereof. Population shall be based on the latest regular or\nspecial census or such other determination as acceptable to the\ncommissioner. (4)\n\nThe amount of\nsuch State aid shall be recomputed each year, on the basis of data reported by\nthe local governing body as accepted by the commissioner. (5)\n\nState aid shall commence in the State\nfiscal year beginning April 1, 1971. No State-aid payments shall be made on the\nbasis of any portion of the debt service of eligible projects which was due and\npayable prior to April 1, 1971. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
