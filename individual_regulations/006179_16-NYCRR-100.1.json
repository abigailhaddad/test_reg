  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 100.1 - New construction of underground facilities in residential subdivisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part\napplies to the new construction of distribution lines, service lines and\nappurtenant facilities within residential subdivisions. Nothing in this Part\nshall be construed to compromise the ability of a state or local agency to\nrequire underground facilities in the exercise of its land use or environmental\nprotection authority. (b) Any\ndistribution line, service line and appurtenant facilities necessary to furnish\npermanent electric service to one or more multiple occupancy buildings\n(including four or more dwelling units) shall be installed underground and any\nsuch facilities necessary to furnish permanent electric service within a\nresidential subdivision in which it is planned to build five or more new\nresidential buildings shall be installed underground if: (1)\nthe residential subdivision will require\nno more than 200 trench feet of facilities per dwelling unit planned within the\nresidential subdivision; or\n(2)\na\nutility's tariff provides for such underground service without contribution; or\n(3)\na governmental authority\nhaving jurisdiction to do so has required undergrounding; or\n(4)\nan applicant requests undergrounding. Note:The number of dwelling units is the criterion to be\nused to determine whether installation is required to be underground. In order\nto ascertain the number of dwelling units, it is necessary to consult the\napproved subdivision map to determine how dwelling units are planned. Each lot\nshown on the map should, in the case of a single family dwelling, be considered\nto contain one dwelling unit unless there is sufficient contrary evidence to\nrender it unlikely that each lot will contain a separate dwelling unit (e.g., a\nfoundation is constructed occupying two lots). The measurement of trench\nfootage should be the shortest distance required to serve the homes within the\nresidential subdivision, consistent with the utility's obligation to provide\nsafe and adequate service. (c) Upon receipt of a proper application, the\nutility shall inform the telephone company and cable television company serving\nthe area in which the residential subdivision is located, of the receipt of\nsuch application. Upon compliance by the applicant with the requirements of\nthis Part, the utility shall install underground electric distribution lines\nwith sufficient capacity and suitable material which, in its judgment, will\nassure that the applicant will receive safe and adequate electric service. Such\ninstallation shall be undertaken by the utility as soon as is reasonably\npossible after receipt of a proper application and shall be made at a time\nappropriate to render service. Construction will not be delayed by the utility\nso that the applicant will be delayed in the sale or other disposal of the\nbuildings, or lots, except where such delay is caused by strikes, fire, flood, inclement weather, unavailability of materials, civil disorders, or other\nconditions beyond the control of the utility. No overhead circuits, including\nstreet lighting circuits, shall thereafter be installed by a utility within a\nresidential subdivision having underground electric distribution\nlines. (d) The utility is permitted\nto designate the service connection point to a residential building or to a\nmultiple occupancy building and the point at which any service line will\nconnect to the utility's electric distribution line or equipment. Each service\nline within the lot line and running to the building shall be installed either\nby the utility, or by the applicant in accordance with the utility's\nspecifications, as the utility may elect and in accord with the utility's\ntariff, provided, however, that the utility's tariff must permit the applicant\nat least to excavate the trench necessary for the underground installation of\ndistribution lines, service lines or appurtenant facilities within the\nresidential subdivision, and provided, further, that allocation of the costs of\nsuch installation shall be determined in accordance with section\n98.2\nof this Title regardless of\nwho installs the service line. (e) A utility may install overhead distribution lines in a residential subdivision\nor section thereof otherwise required to have underground distribution lines in\naccordance with subdivision (b) of this section when: (1)\nthe developer of the residential\nsubdivision is not primarily engaged in the construction of dwelling units\nwithin the residential subdivision; (2)\nno governmental authority having\njurisdiction to do so has required underground service; and\n(3)\neither: (i) five years have elapsed from the sale of\nthe first lot within the residential subdivision to the first application for\ninstallation and the utility has no indication that there will be other new\napplicants in the residential subdivision within six months; or\n(ii)\nfive years have elapsed from the time of\nfinal approval of the residential subdivision or section thereof and less than\n25 percent of the lots have been sold in the residential subdivision or any\nsection thereof except where 10 percent or more of the lots in the residential\nsubdivision or any section thereof have been sold within the last two years. Note:The term final approval refers to authorization of a\nresidential subdivision by governmental authorities having jurisdiction. A\nresidential subdivision is finally approved when all necessary governmental\nconsents have been obtained to allow the developer of the residential\nsubdivision to sell lots and/or build residences. If a residential subdivision\nneed only be approved by a county health department the final approval of that\nagency in accordance with its regulations when received is final. If the town\nplanning board must give its consent as well, final approval is not obtained\nuntil the board and the health department have completed their processes of\nauthorization. A section of a residential subdivision is the smallest unit of a\nsubdivision given final governmental approval. If, for example, the developer\nof a subdivision submits a preliminary plan covering 100 lots but initially\nonly 50 are finally approved, the 50 lot portion is a section of the\nsubdivision. If the residential subdivision contains sections, the percentage\nof lot sales required by condition (3) must be met by every section of the\nsubdivision and not just the section in which the distribution facilities are\nto be installed. In cases where overhead installation would be permissible\nin accordance with condition (3) (paragraph [3] of this subdivision), except\nthat less than five years have elapsed and the utility has reason to believe\nthat the residential subdivision will not be developed sufficiently soon to\npermit the orderly utilization of underground lines installed to serve the\ninitial applicant(s), the utility may petition the commission to allow overhead\ninstallation. Such petition shall set forth the relevant economic, engineering, or environmental factors. The petition shall be granted or denied based on\nthose factors. If the residential subdivision is located within the Adirondack\n\nPark, the utility shall send a copy of the petition to the Adirondack Park\n\nAgency. (f) If a utility receives an application for\nservice within a residential subdivision which is governed by the provisions of\nsubdivision (b) of this section, and the per-foot cost of installing the\nnecessary distribution lines, service lines and appurtenant facilities (other\nthan those accounted for in accounts 368 and 370) will be greater than two\ntimes the cost of installing such facilities as calculated using the applicable\ncharges per foot filed pursuant to section\n98.6\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Title and as set forth in the utility's tariff, the utility or applicant\nmay petition the Secretary of the Commission to allow overhead installation. Such petition shall be filed in accordance with the requirements of section\n3.5\nof this Title and set forth\nthe relevant economic, engineering, or environmental factors. The petition\nshall be reviewed by staff. The secretary shall notify the petitioner within 60\ndays of receipt of the petition either that the petition is granted or that\nstaff objects to it. If staff objects, the petition shall be referred to the\ncommission for further review. The petition shall be granted or denied based on\neconomic, engineering, or environmental factors. If the residential subdivision\nis located within the Adirondack Park, the utility shall send a copy of the\npetition to the Adirondack Park Agency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
