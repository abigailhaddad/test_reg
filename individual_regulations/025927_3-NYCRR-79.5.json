(l) Reverse mortgage loan\napplicants are required to wait 3 days after submitting an application before\nsigning a commitment or in any way proceeding with a reverse mortgage loan. The\n3-day period cannot be waived. (m) Requirements Specific to R PL 280 and R PL 280 -a loans\n(1)\nthe maximum loan to value ratio for any\nloan at the time of loan closing shall not exceed 80 percent of the anticipated\nvalue of the property at anticipated loan maturity or at any time prior\nthereto. The loan to value ratio shall be calculated by dividing the numerator, as defined in paragraph (i) of this subdivision, by the denominator, as defined\nin paragraph (ii) of this subdivision. (i) The\nnumerator of the ratio shall include all principal, all accrued loan interest, all fees, costs and payments incurred in connection with the origination of the\nloan including but not limited to charges for the purchase of annuities, the\npayment of real estate taxes and insurance to the extent that a set aside\naccount is established to fund real estate tax and insurance obligations or the\nlender has committed to advance funds to pay for such taxes and insurance on\nthe property securing the reverse mortgage loan and any shared appreciation\nassuming: (A)\nno prepayment of the reverse\nmortgage loan; (B)\nany loan\namounts, such as credit lines and set aside accounts, which may be drawn at the\ndiscretion of the mortgagor or by the mortgagee are drawn fully at the earliest\nopportunity; (C)\nthe historical\ninterest rate if fixed or, if variable, the yearly average of the base index\nand margin chosen by the lender; and\n(D)\nif applicable, a projected appreciation or\ndepreciation rate for home prices which is determined by the same factor as is\nused in the denominator set forth in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nThe\ndenominator of the ratio shall be determined by increasing or decreasing the\nappraised value of the real property (as determined at loan closing, or no\nearlier than 30 calendar days prior, by an independent certified or licensed\nappraiser as provided for in article 6-E of the Executive Law) by a factor that\nthe creditor reasonably believes will be the average annual increase or\ndecrease in the value of the real property securing the reverse mortgage loan\nfrom the loan closing until the anticipated loan maturity; provided, however, that this factor shall in no event exceed the average of the yearly changes in\nthe Consumer Price Index for the geographic area closest to the real property\nfor the eight years preceding the year in which the loan is made without the\nsuperintendent's prior written approval. (iii)\n\nFor a term reverse mortgage loan, the\nanticipated loan maturity shall be the date of maturity of the loan. (iv)\n\nFor a tenure reverse mortgage loan, the\nsuperintendent may, in his or her discretion, review and approve the data and\nassumptions used to establish the anticipated loan maturity for each reverse\nmortgage loan. (2)\n\nAs an\nalternative to subdivision (1) of this section, the parties may agree that the\ntotal obligation of the mortgagor to the mortgagee arising from the reverse\nmortgage loan shall be no greater than 80 percent of the future appraised value\nof the property at maturity, calculated in accordance with the standards set\nforth in subsection (1)(i) above. The 80 percent cap shall be exclusive of any\nactual losses incurred by the mortgagee as a direct result of a breach of a\nloan covenant by the mortgagor. The difference between the principal and\naccrued interest and 80 percent of the actual value of the property at maturity\nshall be known as \"equity participation.\"\n(3)\n\nAt the end of the term for all R PL 280\nand R PL 280 -a term loans, the mortgagor may request that the real property\nsecuring the loan be reappraised to increase the payments made to the mortgagor\nor to extend the loan term. Except for term loans insured by any agency of the\n\nState of New York, such reappraisal may be performed at the mortgagee's sole\ndiscretion. In all cases, the mortgagee may require the mortgagor to pay the\ncost of such reappraisal in advance. In the event the value of the property has\nincreased, the mortgagee may increase the loan payments or extend the loan term\n(and, for term loans insured by any agency of the State of New York, must\nincrease the loan payment(s) or extend the loan term), subject to the\nfollowing: (i) The loan-to-value ratio\nlimitations, as determined pursuant to this Part as of the date on which the\nincrease or extension would begin, shall not be exceeded. (ii)\n\nAny existing insurance coverage shall be\nincreased to insure the additional amounts to be due. (iii)\n\nThe mortgagor shall execute all\ndocuments reasonably requested by the mortgagee and pay all reasonable fees and\ncosts associated with the increase in payments or the extension of the loan\nterm provided that such fees and costs have been previously disclosed in\nwriting to the mortgagor. (4)\nA lender must, in accordance with the\nfinancial assessment form provided by the Department, review all applicants for\nfinancial fitness as it relates to the payment of an applicant's property\ncharges. In the event that the results of the financial assessment require a\nset aside account to be established, such account may bear interest at a rate\nthat is different from the interest rate on other advances made pursuant to the\nterms of the reverse mortgage loan. A mortgagee may only charge interest on\nadvances actually made from the set aside account and not on the entire balance\nin the set aside account. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
