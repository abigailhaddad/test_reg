(ii)\nPROS programs shall establish a\ntherapeutic environment which fosters awareness, hopefulness and motivation for\nrecovery, and incorporates a harm reduction philosophy. (2)\n\nDepending upon program configuration and\nlicensure category, PROS programs will include the following components: community rehabilitation and support (CRS); intensive rehabilitation (IR); ongoing rehabilitation and support (ORS); and clinical treatment. (i) The CRS component shall be designed to\nengage and assist individuals in managing their illness and in restoring those\nskills and supports necessary to live in the community. (ii)\n\nThe IR component shall be designed to\nintensively assist individuals in attaining specific life roles such as those\nrelated to competitive employment, independent housing and school. The IR\ncomponent may also be used to provide targeted interventions to reduce the risk\nof hospitalization or relapse, loss of housing or involvement with the criminal\njustice system, and to help individuals manage their symptoms. (iii)\n\nThe ORS component shall be designed to\nassist individuals in managing symptoms and overcoming functional impairments\nas they integrate into a competitive workplace. ORS interventions shall focus\non supporting individuals in maintaining competitive integrated employment. Such services shall be provided off-site. (iv)\n\nThe clinical treatment component shall\nbe designed to help stabilize, ameliorate and control an individual's symptoms\nof mental illness. Clinical treatment interventions must be highly integrated\ninto the support and rehabilitation focus of the PROS program. The frequency\nand intensity of clinical treatment services shall be commensurate with the\nneeds of the target population. (3)\nA comprehensive PROS program shall offer, at a minimum, CRS, IR and ORS components. A comprehensive PROS program must be\nable to provide the following assessments: (i) psychosocial assessment; (ii)\npsychiatric rehabilitation assessment that addresses living, learning, working\nand social domains; and\n(iii)\nscreening for alcohol, substance abuse, and nicotine addiction.

(5)\nA\nlimited license PROS program shall offer IR and ORS components. (6)\n\nAll PROS providers shall establish\nmechanisms regarding the coordination of rehabilitation, treatment and support\nservices for individuals, including linkage agreements with other providers as\nappropriate. These mechanisms shall address: (i) coordination among any of the PROS\ncomponents as specified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision that are delivered\nby the same PROS provider; (ii)\ncoordination among any of the PROS components as specified in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision which are delivered by multiple PROS providers; and\n(iii)\ncoordination of PROS services with\nother service providers.

However, on an occasional\nbasis, group sizes of between 13 and 24 members are permissible if the group is\nco-facilitated by at least two staff members, and there is documentation that\nthe expanded group size is clinically appropriate for the service being\nprovided. Pursuant to section\n512.11\n(b)(13)\nof\nthis Part, a PROS program may, within the specified limits, still use the\nservice to satisfy the service frequency requirement of section\n512.11\n(b)(11)\nof\nthis Part for some group participants.

Such services may include, but are not limited to, cognitive remediation services. (c) Admission and registration. (1)\n\nAdmission criteria must conform to\napplicable State and Federal law governing non-discrimination. Admission\ncriteria shall not exclude individuals because of past histories of\nincarceration or substance abuse. A provider of service shall not deny access\nto services by an otherwise appropriate individual solely on the basis of\nmultiple diagnoses or a diagnosis of HIV infection, AIDS, or AIDS-related\ncomplex. (2)\n\nThe program's\nadmission process, including any criteria governing participation in the\nprogram, shall be clearly described and available for review by participants, their families or significant others. (3)\n\nProviders of service shall not use\ncoercion in regard to program admission or discharge, referrals to other\nprograms, or the level of service provision, provided that nothing in this\nparagraph shall be interpreted to affect or otherwise impact the delivery of\nservices to an individual under a court order issued pursuant to section\n9.60\nof the\n\nMental Hygiene Law. (4)\n\nPrior to\nadmission to a PROS program, pre-admission screening services may be provided. During such time, the individual shall be considered to be in pre-admission\nstatus. (5)\n\nTo be eligible for\nadmission to a PROS program, a person must: (i) be 18 years of age or older; (ii)\nhave a designated mental illness\ndiagnosis; (iii)\nhave a functional\ndisability due to the severity and duration of mental illness; and\n(iv)\nbe recommended for admission by a\nlicensed practitioner of the healing arts (LPHA).

The initial service recommendation plan identifies the\nindividual's primary service needs and a list of services in which he or she\nwill participate and remains valid for up to 60 days or until the IRP is\ncompleted. The initial service recommendation plan shall be considered part of\nthe admission documentation and shall be maintained in the case record as a\nseparate document, distinct from the IRP. (9)\n\nWhen admission is not indicated, a\nnotation shall be made of the following: (i) the reason for not admitting the individual; and\n(ii)\nany referrals made to other programs or\nservices. (10)\n\nUpon a\ndecision to admit an individual to a PROS program, a recipient attestation form\nshall be completed. Such form shall be dated and signed by the individual, which indicates his or her choice to participate in the PROS program and\nspecified program components. (11)\n\nUpon admission of an individual and the completion of the recipient attestation\nform, the PROS program shall complete and submit a PROS registration form, using the registration system approved by the office. (i) Such registration process must include\nthe identification of the specific PROS program components in which the\nindividual will be participating. (ii)\n\nIndividuals may register in multiple\nPROS programs for unduplicated components of service. However, in no event\nshall an individual be registered for clinical treatment only. (12)\n\nThe PROS admission date for\nan individual shall be the date that the PROS program submits a completed\nregistration pursuant to this subdivision. (13)\n\nUpon confirmation of acceptance of the\nregistration request on behalf of an individual, such individual shall be\nconsidered registered in the PROS program, effective on the date provided by\nthe office. Individuals who are registered in a PROS program are not restricted\nto the limitations of pre-admission billing pursuant to section\n512.11\nof this Part. (14)\n\nIf a registration request on behalf of\nan individual is denied, such individual shall be discharged from the PROS\nprogram. The discharge summary shall identify any referrals made to other\nprograms or services. (d) Staffing. (1)\nA PROS provider shall continuously employ\nan adequate number and appropriate mix of clinical staff consistent with the\nobjectives of the program and the intended outcomes.

(2)\nPROS providers shall maintain an adequate\nand appropriate number of professional staff relative to the size of the\nclinical staff. (i) A comprehensive PROS\nprovider shall be deemed to have met such standard if at least 40 percent of\nthe total clinical staff full-time equivalents (FTEs) are represented by\nprofessional staff. (ii)\nA limited\nlicense PROS program shall be deemed to have met such standard if at least 20\npercent of the total clinical staff FTEs are represented by professional\nstaff. (3)\n\nFor the\npurpose of calculating professional staff ratios, a provider may include staff\ncredentialed by the United States Psychiatric Rehabilitation Association\n(USPRA) for up to 20 percent of the total number of required professional\nstaff. (4)\n\nFor comprehensive PROS\nprograms, at least one of the members of the provider's professional staff\nshall be a licensed practitioner of the healing arts and shall be employed on a\nfull-time basis. (5)\n\nFor limited\nlicense PROS programs, at least one of the members of the provider's\nprofessional staff shall be employed on a full-time basis. (6)\nIR services shall be provided by, or\nunder the direct supervision of, professional staff. (7)\nPROS providers shall maintain an adequate\nand appropriate number of staff in proportion to the number of individuals\nserved. Providers shall be deemed to have met such standard if their staffing\nratios, based on average attendance, are at least in accordance with the\nfollowing: (i) for CRS, a ratio of one\nclinical staff member to every 12 individuals receiving CRS group\nservices; (ii)\nfor IR, a ratio of\none clinical staff member to every eight individuals receiving IR group\nservices; (iii)\nfor ORS, a case\nload of no more than 22 individuals per clinical staff member; and\n(iv)\nfor comprehensive PROS programs with\nclinical treatment, the following additional standards shall apply: (a) PROS staffing must include a minimum\nof.125 FTE psychiatrist and.125 FTE registered professional nurse for every 40\nindividuals receiving clinical treatment services; and\n(b) additional psychiatry, nursing and other\nstaff shall be included, as necessary, to meet the volume and clinical needs of\npersons receiving clinical treatment services; (v) programs may use nurse practitioners in\npsychiatry to partially offset the requirement for psychiatrist coverage\npursuant to clause (iv)(a) of this paragraph, consistent with the following\nrequirements: (a) all programs must maintain\na minimum.125 FTE psychiatrist; (b) after having met the minimum.125 FTE\npsychiatrist required in clause (a) of this subparagraph, programs may elect to\nsubstitute nurse practitioner in psychiatry FTE for the additional required\npsychiatrist FTE at a ratio not to exceed 50 percent of the total psychiatry\nrequirement; (c) programs must\nensure clinical collaboration between the nurse practitioner in psychiatry and\na psychiatrist who is employed by the sponsor, consistent with New York State\n\nEducation Law governing the licensure of nurse practitioners; (d) nurse practitioners used to offset\nrequired psychiatrist staffing must be certified as nurse practitioners in\npsychiatry; (e) nurse practitioner\nin psychiatry FTE may not be used to simultaneously satisfy the nurse staffing\nrequirement pursuant to clause (iv)(a) of this paragraph, and to offset the\npsychiatrist staffing requirement. (8)\n\nAll staff shall be afforded regular\nsupervision. Such supervision shall address quality of care provided and\nongoing staff development. (9)\nA\nPROS provider may use recipient employees. In such circumstances, the following\nrequirements shall apply: (i) Recipient\nemployees shall be included in the PROS provider's staffing plan. (ii)\nPROS participants may perform a variety\nof non-paid functions related to the operation of the program as part of the\nprogram's therapeutic environment when such functions are identified in the\nperson's individualized recovery plan. Non-paid functions of PROS participants\nshall not be reflected in the PROS provider's staffing plan. (iii)\n\nRecipient employees shall adhere to the\nsame requirements, pursuant to this Part, which are applicable to other PROS\nemployees. (iv)\n\nRecipient employees\nshall receive training regarding the principles and requirements of\nconfidentiality, ethics and boundaries, and work place harassment. (v) Ongoing supervision of recipient\nemployees shall address, as warranted, boundary issues, transition between\nroles, and potential conflicts of interest. (e) Individualized recovery planning process. (1)\n\nThe individualized recovery planning\nprocess shall be carried out by, or under the direct supervision of, a member\nof the professional staff. Such process is intended to be reflective of\nperson-centered planning principles and shall therefore be conducted in\ncollaboration with the individual and any persons the individual has identified\nfor participation. (2)\n\nThe\nindividualized recovery planning process shall address the differences in\nindividuals' cognitive abilities and/or learning style, culture, gender, age\nand other issues that may impact service delivery. (3)\n\nThe individualized recovery planning\nprocess shall include, but not be limited to, the following activities: (i) meetings with the PROS participant and\nrelevant others; (ii)\nidentification and completion, within 45 days of the individual's admission\ndate, of all required screenings or assessments, as determined based on the\nPROS Components in which the individual has enrolled; (iii)\nlinkage and coordination activities\nwith other service providers for the purpose of assessing plan progress and\nassuring integration of services; and\n(iv)\ndevelopment of an individualized\nrecovery plan (IRP). (4)\n\nAn initial IRP shall be developed within 60 days of the individual's admission\ndate. (5)\n\nEach individual's IRP\nshall be reviewed for progress as follows: (i) Six month review and update of the IRP: programs are required to conduct a\nreview and update of the IRP at least every six months or sooner if conditions\nwarrant it. This review and update should result in a new IRP reflective of the\nindividual's progress or lack of progress toward his or her goal and must be\nsigned by all required parties, including: (a) PROS participant; (b) clinical\nstaff member who prepared the IRP; (c) professional staff member if the clinical\nstaff member who prepared the IRP is not a professional; and\n(d) physician or nurse practitioner in\npsychiatry, if the individual is enrolled in the clinical component. (ii)\n\nThree month review of IR/ORS\nservices: reviews must be conducted every three months to determine the need\nfor continuation of IR or ORS services. This review concerns the continuation\nof the IR or ORS services and does not require that the complete IRP be\nreviewed. (6)\n\nEach IRP\nReview should result in an IRP Review Summary. This summary provides the\njustification for any changes to be made within the IRP and/or justification\nfor parts of the IRP that will remain the same for the next review\nperiod. (7)\n\nFor individuals\nreceiving IR or ORS services, the IR or ORS services identified in the IRP\nshall be assessed for continued need, at a minimum, every three months. The\ndecision to continue or discontinue the service shall be documented and include\nthe following: (i) reason for the\ndecision; (ii)\nsignature of the\nindividual; and\n(iii)\nsignature of\nthe clinical staff member assessing the need for continued service. If the\nclinical staff member who conducted the assessment is not a member of the\nprofessional staff, the signature of the professional staff member who\nsupervised the staff member must also be recorded. (8)\n\nIf a PROS participant is receiving PROS\nservices from multiple PROS providers: (i) the provider of CRS services shall be responsible for forwarding copies of the\nIRP and related updates to the provider of IR or ORS services; and\n(ii)\nthe provider of IR or ORS services shall\nbe responsible for developing an IR or ORS plan which shall be a component of\nthe IRP, and which is consistent with the IRP developed by the provider of CRS\nservices. (9)\n\nIf a PROS\nparticipant receives PROS services only from one PROS provider, and receives\nonly IR or ORS services, the provider of IR or ORS services shall be\nresponsible for the completion, review and update of an IRP pursuant to the\nrequirements of this subdivision. (10)\n\nIf a PROS participant receives solely\nORS services from a comprehensive PROS, the provider shall be responsible only\nfor completing a psychiatric rehabilitation assessment with an employment focus\nand for developing an IRP that is reflective of an employment support goal. The\nprovider is not required to complete a relapse prevention plan with the\nindividual, but may do so. All other documentation requirements still\npertain. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
