  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 9.2 - Sale of certificates of deposit in new york by out-of-state savings and loan association\n\nState Regulations\n[Statutory authority: Banking Law, §§131, 670 ] A savings and\nloan association organized under the laws of the State of California (the\n\"S&L\") asked whether it would be permissible for the S&L to issue\ncertificates of deposit in denominations of $100,000 to individuals and\ninvestment houses within the State of New York under the circumstances\ndescribed in its letter. The S&L would deliver the certificates to the New\n\nYork commercial bank (the \"Bank\") with which it currently maintains a\ncommercial account and would issue a power of attorney to the Bank, authorizing\nit, upon receipt of specific instructions, to countersign one or more of the\ncertificates of the S&L and to deliver the certificates, as so\ncountersigned, to the purchaser or purchasers thereof against payment therefor. The funds received as payment for the certificates would be deposited in the\n\nBank to the credit of the S&L. The sale of the certificates would be\ngoverned, in each case, by the terms of the purchase orders which would be\naccepted in California. By executing the purchase orders, the purchasers of the\ncertificates would acknowledge that the Bank's actions--i.e., the completion of\ndelivery in New York on behalf of the S&L--would not give rise to any\nrights against the Bank. The S&L would permit the certificates to be paid, at maturity, from its commercial account with the Bank unless it exercised its\nright, prior to maturity, to insist upon presentment and payment at its offices\nin California. Subdivision 1 of section\n131\nof the Banking\n\nLaw provides, in relevant part, as follows: \"No corporation, domestic or foreign, other than a national\nbank or a federal reserve bank, unless expressly authorized by the laws of this\nstate, shall employ any part of its property, or be in any way interested in\nany fund which shall be employed for the purpose of receiving deposits, making\ndiscounts, receiving for transmission or transmitting money in any manner\nwhatsoever... \"\nSection\n670\nof the Banking\n\nLaw reads as follows: \"Any person or corporation, who acts as agent or\nrepresentative of any mortgage, loan or investment corporation or building and\nmutual loan corporation or association or co-operative savings and loan\nassociation organized outside of this state, while such mortgage, loan or\ninvestment corporation or building and mutual loan corporation or association\nor co-operative savings and loan association shall not be authorized under a\nlicense of the superintendent of banks to do business in this state, is guilty\nof a misdemeanor.\"\nThe fact that the Bank would be authorized to countersign and\ndeliver the certificates in the name of the S&L, that it would be\nauthorized to accept payment therefor on behalf of the S&L, that the\npayment would be retained in the S&L's account in New York and that the\n\nBank would not incur any liability to the purchasers of the certificates in its\nown name indicate that the Bank would be acting solely as \"agent\" for the\nS&L. As such, it would be accepting and delivering certificates in New York\non behalf of, or as the representative of, a foreign corporation. The foreign\ncorporation would thereby have an interest in a fund employed in the receipt of\ndeposits within the meaning of, and would otherwise be engaged, through its\nagent, in the activities proscribed by, Section\n131\n(1)\nof the Banking Law. Finally, the Bank\nitself, as representative of the foreign S&L, would be violating Section\n670\nof the Banking\n\nLaw. It was suggested, on behalf of the S&L, that Sections 131\nand 670 were inapplicable and that the legality of the proposed transaction\nshould be determined solely by reference to Article 10 of the Banking Law (and\n\nSection 408(1) thereof in particular). The language of the statutory provisions\ncited, however, prohibits any such construction of the statute. Section 131(1), for example, specifically states that it applies to any \"corporation, domestic\nor foreign ________ other than a national bank or a federal reserve bank\" and\n\nSection 670 specifically prohibits \"any person or corporation\" from acting \"as\nagent or representative of any ________ loan or investment corporation or\nbuilding and mutual loan corporation or association or co-operative savings and\nloan association organized outside of this state, while such [entity] ________\nshall not be authorized under a license of the superintendent of banks to do\nbusiness in this state________\"\nIt was the Department's view that the proposed transaction\nwould require substantial restructuring if it were to comply with the Banking\n\nLaw. More precisely, all activities related to the certificates of deposit, including receipt of payment for the certificates and signature of the\ncertificates, should be transacted outside of New York.
