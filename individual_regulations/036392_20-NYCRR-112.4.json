Each beneficiary, on such beneficiary's individual New York State\npersonal income tax return, must apply such beneficiary's share of the\nfiduciary adjustment as a modification of such beneficiary's Federal adjusted\ngross income in order to determine such beneficiary's New York adjusted gross\nincome.
