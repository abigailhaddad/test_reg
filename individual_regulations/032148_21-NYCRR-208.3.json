  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 208.3 - Procedure\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe award of a lease to use an authority facility under this\n\nPart shall be by open competitive process. Prior to the award of any lease, the\nauthority shall advertise the availability of the opportunity to acquire such\nlease in the New York State Contract Reporter and evaluate all proposals\nreceived from qualified transportation corporations. The authority shall allow\npotential lease holders reasonable time and opportunity to inspect the\nauthority's facilities and to develop a responsive proposal. The authority\nshall also, however, administer the proposal, evaluation and award process in a\nprompt and business-like manner. (a) Proposals. Each proposal will be required to include: (1)\na plan and schedule for initial\ninstallation, including a traffic control plan in conformance with the New York\n\nState Department of Transportation's Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices\n(MUTCD); (2)\na plan for access to\nthe fiber optic facilities for operation and maintenance including traffic\ncontrol plans in conformity with the MUTCD; (3)\nthe capacity of the equipment proposed to\nbe provided, an analysis of projected demand and a plan to serve that demand by\nthe proposed installed capacity; (4)\na statement of the process by which\nrequests for private cable access to the leasee's excess conduit capacity may\nbe made by other users and the terms and conditions of such use; (5)\nthe proposed payment to be made for\noccupancy of the authority's structures and right-of-way; (6)\nthe method of removal or abandonment of\nthe equipment to be implemented at the end of the lease term; and\n(7)\nany other information the authority may\ndeem material in respect to a specific authority facility or site. Such other information as may be material and helpful in the\nevaluation of the proposals may be included in a concise form. (b) Review and\nevaluation. Review and evaluation of the proposals will be by the executive\ndirector, the chief engineer and general counsel with such staff and/or outside\nassistance as they shall deem appropriate and necessary. The authority may\nconsult with other governmental agencies in the course of its review, but, under the provisions of the Public Authorities Law, sole responsibility for the\ndetermination of the award shall rest with the authority. The authority shall\nrequire the favorable recommendation of the chief engineer as a precondition to\nany award. The criteria for evaluation will include: (1)\n\nThe relative degree of disruption of the\nright-of-way anticipated during installation and maintenance and the extent to\nwhich such disruption may affect traffic flow and safety, landscaping, and\nprotected resources, as well as the equipment's appearance, its structural and\ncontrolled access integrity and its ability to be maintained, widened, and\notherwise modified. To minimize disruption all proposals should be in\naccordance with the following guidelines: (i) Except where the use of an authority structure is necessary, all fiber optic\nequipment should be installed in underground ducts located as far as practical\nfrom any roadway or graded shoulder and no part of the fiber optic equipment\nshould be visible above ground. (ii)\n\nThe initial installation should include\nall apurtenances necessary or incidental to the operation of the equipment, and\nshould include all manholes and other duct access points at appropriate\nspacings to permit the pulling of additional cables into the duct system\nwithout further excavation or construction. (iii)\n\nWhere the equipment is to be installed\non a structure, the location shall be subject to the approval of the chief\nengineer and shall be such that it will not interfere with the regular\nmaintenance and operation of the facility. Installation on structures shall not\nbe visible to motorists or pedestrians using the facility and shall not\nsignificantly alter the appearance of the bridge in any way. (iv)\n\nAll methods and details of the\ninstallation and subsequent maintenance shall be subject to the review and\napproval of the authority. Access to authority facilities will normally be\nlimited to weekday hours between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. (v) Upon completion of the installation and\nany subsequent maintenance activities, all disturbed areas shall be returned to\ntheir original condition unless agreed to in writing by the\nauthority. (vi)\n\nThe installation\nshould be along the longitudinal right-of-way only, connecting a single entry\npoint to a single exit point. Service connections to and from the authority's\nright- of-way should not be proposed. (vii)\n\nProposals should take into account\nplanned or likely improvements or alterations in the authority's\nfacilities. (viii)\n\nThe safety of\nthe public and the structural integrity and maintainability of the authority's\nfacilities are of primary importance to the authority. In no case will any\ninstallation be permitted that will adversely impact either. (2)\n\nMeasures proposed for access\nto the fiber optic transmission equipment from outside the right-of-way, which\nshould be consistent with the following requirements: (i) Access shall be subject to the approval\nof the authority and shall be by existing authority pedestrian or vehicular\naccess route unless otherwise agreed to in writing and shall be generally\nlimited to weekdays between the hours of 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. (ii)\n\nThe authority may impose conditions for\npolicing and other controls as are necessary to assure the safety of the public\nand to avoid or minimize interference with facility use. During installation, operation and maintenance barriers and/or signs and/or warning devices\nconforming to the MUTCD shall be installed as required to alert and protect\nfacility users to activities within or adjacent to the right-of-way. (iii)\n\nWhere signs conforming to the MUTCD are\nplaced in the vicinity of the roadway, shoulder, or adjacent clear recovery\narea, they shall be collapsible upon impact from a vehicle. (iv)\n\nAt no time will the parking, stopping or\nplacement of vehicles, equipment or materials be allowed on the roadway, shoulders or adjacent clearway without the expressed permission of the\nauthority. (3)\n\nThe total\ncapacity being installed. Installation of fiber optics equipment shall be of a\ncharacter and capacity to preclude the programmed need for any additional\ndisruption. Absent compelling circumstances, the authority will not permit\ninstallation of additional ducts or conduits during the term of the lease. The\nauthority will, however, allow installation of additional cable and/or\nreplacement of existing cable within a previously installed duct or conduit to\nthe extent it can be accomplished with minimal direct or indirect interference\nwith the maintenance and operation of the facility. (4)\n\nThe degree to which the equipment, such\nas duct space, will be available for use by others and the proposed terms and\nconditions of such use. There is a presumption that it is in the public\ninterest for the competing transportation corporations to provide service\nwithin the available corridors. In order to protect and encourage such\ncompetition and ensure minimum future intrusion into the right-of-way and to\navoid disturbance to traffic by installation of additional fiber optic\nequipment, the proposer is required to provide a description of the facilities, such as duct space, which will be available to others and how others will be\nprovided fair access to the equipment proposed to be installed. An outline of\nthe terms and conditions under which the proposer would make such equipment\navailable to other services shall be provided. (5)\n\nProposed payment or payments to be made\nfor use and occupancy of the authority facility. The authority expects to\ncharge an assessment for the privilege of permitting installation and operation\nof fiber optic transmission equipment on its facilities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
