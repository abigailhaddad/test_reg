  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 148.3 - Performance evaluation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Employees covered by this Part shall be evaluated every six months from the\ntime of appointment to a salary grade. (b) An employee must be on the payroll at the\ntime of rating. Employees will not be evaluated for any period in unpaid leave\nstatus. When an employee is off the payroll or in less than regular full-pay\nstatus for a full payroll period or more, the employee's rating period is to be\nextended by the same amount of time (in multiples of full payroll periods). Each rating period will cover six months in paid status, which need not be\ncontinuous service. (c) The\nperformance of each employee shall be rated at one of the following three\nlevels: (1)\n\nOutstanding. The employee's\nperformance is clearly exceptional in comparison with performance expectations. The employee's performance consistently exceeds all performance expectations\nfor the job. The employee can be relied upon to perform the most difficult and\ncomplex assignments in an independent and timely manner. Work is always\ncompleted in an accurate and appropriate manner. This exceptional performance\ncauses the employee to stand out among other employees in the work\nunit. (2)\n\nEffective. (i) This is a broad category which covers a\nwide range of employees, all of whom are performing acceptably. It is the\nexpected and usual level of performance. (ii)\n\nThe employee usually meets and sometimes\nexceeds performance expectations for the job. The employee generally performs\nassigned tasks/duties in a good, competent manner and may be recognized as a\nparticular asset to the work unit. The employee can be given assignments with\nconfidence that generally they will be completed in an efficient, effective\nmanner. The employee's performance may be characterized by the completion of\nmore difficult assignments, or in the completion of regular assignments more\neffectively or rapidly than generally expected. (iii)\n\nAn effective employee may also be\ncharacterized as meeting minimal performance expectations for the job. There\nmay be areas of performance which should be improved. The employee may meet\nperformance expectations for certain tasks or assignments, but some assignments\nmay require extra follow-up and direction by the supervisor, or the supervisor\nmay feel it necessary to withhold certain assignments from the\nemployee. (3)\n\nUnsatisfactory. Generally, the employee does not meet expectations for many of\nthe important tasks/duties of this job. The employee frequently fails to meet\nreasonable expectations for routine tasks and/or occasionally fails to meet\nperformance expectations in carrying out critical assignments. There is need\nfor immediate and significant improvement in performance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n148.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
