  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-8.7 - Encapsulation procedures\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll material used for repair or encapsulation of asbestos\nmaterial shall have a flame spread rating, fireproofing and smoke\ncharacteristics similar to the material being repaired or encapsulated. Also, the encapsulant shall not alter the insulating characteristics of the material\nsubject to encapsulation, and the encapsulant shall not add excess weight to\nthe material increasing the potential that the material may delaminate from\nitself (cohesion failure), or from its substrate (adhesion failure). Encapsulation of asbestos material shall be conducted in accordance with the\nfollowing: (a) Regulated abatement\nwork area preparation. The regulated abatement work area shall be pre-cleaned, isolated and negative air established in accordance with Subpart 56-7 of this\n\nPart. (b) Repair materials. Damaged\nand missing areas of existing materials shall be repaired with non-asbestos\nmaterial. The material shall adhere to existing surfaces and provide a base for\napplication of encapsulating agents. (c) Asbestos material removal. Loose or\nhanging ACM, PACM or asbestos material shall be removed in accordance with the\nrequirements of section\n56-8.4\nof this Subpart. (d) Testing of encapsulants. Encapsulants\nshall be field tested prior to use by applying each to a small area to\ndetermine suitability for the material to be encapsulated. Testing shall be\nconducted only after the isolation barriers are in place and negative air has\nbeen established. (e) Bridging\nencapsulants. (1)\n\nThickness requirements. Bridging encapsulants shall be applied to provide the manufacturer's specified\nminimum dry-film thickness over sprayed asbestos surfaces. (2)\n\nColor requirement When using bridging\nencapsulant, a different color for each coat shall be used. (f) Latex paint. Latex paint shall\nnot be used as a bridging encapsulant. It shall be considered a dilute lockdown\nencapsulating agent and used only as a coating for lockdown purposes for\nsurfaces during cleanup procedures as per Subpart 56-9 of this Part. (g) Penetrating encapsulants. (1)\n\nPenetration requirements. Penetrating\nencapsulants shall be applied and penetrate existing asbestos material to the\nsubstrate. (2)\n\nTesting of\npenetration. During treatment with a penetrating encapsulant, selected random\ncore samples of asbestos material shall be removed and checked to verify full\ndepth of penetration. (3)\n\nColor\nrequirement. Each coat of penetrating encapsulant shall be color coded as per\nmanufacturer's recommendations, if any, except for the prohibition of pigment\nuse. (h) Methods of\napplication. Encapsulants shall be applied using airless spray equipment as\nfollows: (1)\n\nSpraying pressure. Spraying\nshall be performed at the lowest pressure range possible to minimize asbestos\nfiber release. (2)\n\nSpray tip. The\noptimum spray tip shall be chosen on the basis of the viscosity and percent\nsolids of the encapsulant. The cone projection of the tip shall be as specified\nby the manufacturer. (3)\n\nSubsequent\ncoats. Each subsequent coat of encapsulant shall be applied at a 90-degree\nangle to the preceding coat application or per manufacturer's\nspecifications. (4)\n\nEncapsulant\nsolvent or vehicle. The encapsulant solvent or vehicle shall not be or contain\na volatile material. It shall not release hazardous air pollutants, as defined\nby NYS DEC 6 NYCRR section 200.1(ag), into the air when applied or during\ncuring. (i) Encapsulant\nfire-resistance properties. If the asbestos material has been used for fire\nretardation or protection of structural members or both, the encapsulant\nmaterial used shall have a flame spread rating, fireproofing and smoke\ncharacteristics similar to the material being repaired or\nencapsulated. (j) Marking or\nlabeling. Encapsulated ACM, PACM, or asbestos material shall be conspicuously\nmarked or labeled in order to warn persons of its presence. (k) Cleanup. Waste cleanup shall be in\naccordance with section\n56-8.5\nof this Subpart. (l) Final cleaning and clearance air\nsampling. Final cleaning and clearance air sampling shall be in accordance with\n\nSubpart 56-9 of this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-8.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
