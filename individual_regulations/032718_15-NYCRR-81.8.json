The person who acquired the junk and salvage vehicle retains the\nother two parts of form MV-907A. The transfer copy serves as proof of ownership\nfor the vehicle and may be used to transfer the vehicle. This subdivision does\nnot apply to scrap processors. (2)\n\nThe requirement for completing an MV-907A shall not apply to a person who\nacquires a junk and salvage vehicle by receiving a properly endorsed MV-907A\n(transfer copy) unless and until such person is ready to transfer the entire\nvehicle. Such MV-907A (transfer copy) shall be proof of ownership for such\nvehicle. (3)\n\nScrap processors. A\nscrap processor who acquires a junk and salvage vehicle shall follow the\nprocedure set forth in this subdivision, except that a scrap processor shall\nnot purchase any material which may have been a vehicle or a major component\npart of a vehicle, if recognizable as such, from any person other than a dealer\nregistered pursuant to section\n415\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law, an insurance company, a governmental agency, a\nmanufacturer of motor vehicles, a person in whose name a certificate of title\nor other ownership document has been issued for such vehicle, a person alleging\nownership and utilizing form MV-35, signed and properly completed, for a\nvehicle at least eight model years old and worth $750 or less, or a person\nregistered or certified or issued an identification number pursuant to this\n\nPart.

The scrap processor must send certificates of title and completed forms\nMV-35 to the Department of Motor Vehicles within 15 days. (4)\n\nInsurance companies. If an insurance\ncompany is required to file an MV-907A, either an appraisal report or two\npictures of the vehicle, taken from two different points, showing the major\ndamage to the vehicle, if any, shall be filed with the DMV copy of the MV-907A. This provision shall not apply to an MV-907A filed with respect to an\nunrecovered stolen vehicle. If an out-of-state insurance company uses an\nadjustor in New York to settle a total loss claim, then the adjustor shall file\nform MV-907A. If an insurance company authorizes a salvage pool or a vehicle\ndismantler to possess a vehicle, but is unable to promptly deliver the MV-907A\nfor that vehicle, it shall deliver or mail within four days a written document\nauthorizing the salvage pool or vehicle dismantler to possess the vehicle. The\nwritten document must identify the vehicle by year, make, vehicle\nidentification number and, if appropriate, insurance company file number. More\nthan one vehicle may be identified on a single letter or other written\ndocument. (5)\n\nSalvage pools.
