At 10-day intervals, the sum of the daily\ndifferences is calculated and compared to the thresholds in clauses\n(\na\n) and (\nb\n) of this subparagraph to determine\nif a leak is suspected. A leak is suspected when: (a) the tank has a recurring accumulation of\nwater within the 10-day period; or\n(b) the sum of the daily differences over the\nten-day interval exceeds the largest of three-quarters of one percent (0.0075)\nof: (1)\ntank design capacity; (2)\ntotal amount of petroleum delivered to\nthe UST system; or\n(3)\ntotal amount\nof petroleum dispensed from the UST\nsystem. (2)\n\nManual tank gauging.

(iii)\n\nThe\nequipment used is capable of measuring the level of petroleum over the full\nrange of the tank's height to the nearest one-eighth of an inch. (iv)\nA leak is suspected and subject to the\nrequirements of section\n2.4\nof this Subpart if the\nvariation between beginning and ending measurements exceeds the weekly or\nmonthly standards in Table 2: Table 2: Manual Tank\n\nGauging\n\nTank Design Capacity\n\nMinimum Test Duration\n\nWeekly Standard (One Test)\n\nMonthly Standard (Four-Test Average)\n<550\n36\n10\n5\n551 to 1,000 (tank diameter = 64\")\n44\n9\n4\n551 to 1,000 (tank diameter = 48\")\n58\n12\n6\n(v) Tanks with a design capacity equal to or\nless than 550 gallons, and tanks with a design capacity from 551 to 1,000\ngallons that meet the tank diameter criteria in Table 2, may use this as the\nsole method of leak detection.

(iii)\n\nThe\nmeasurement of vapors by the monitoring device is not rendered inoperative by\ngroundwater, rainfall, soil moisture, or other known interferences so that a\nleak could go undetected for more than seven days. (iv)\n\nThe level of background contamination in\nthe excavation zone will not interfere with the method used to detect leaks\nfrom the tank. (v) Vapor monitors\nare designed and operated to detect any significant increase in concentration\nabove background levels of the petroleum stored in the UST system, a component\nor components of that substance, or a tracer compound placed in the UST\nsystem.

Assessments developed after October 13, 2015 must be signed by a\nprofessional engineer or professional geologist licensed and registered in New\n\nYork State (by the New York State Education Department under Title 8 of Article\n145 of the Environmental Conservation Law, entitled \"Engineering, Land\n\nSurveying, and Geology\"). (vii)\n\nMonitoring wells are clearly marked in accordance with paragraph 2.2(d)(3) of\nthis Subpart and secured to avoid unauthorized access and\ntampering. (6)\n\nGroundwater monitoring. Testing or monitoring for liquids on\nthe groundwater must meet the following requirements: (i) The petroleum stored is immiscible in\nwater and has a specific gravity of less than one. (ii)\n\nGroundwater is never more than 20 feet\nfrom the ground surface, and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil(s) between\nthe UST system and the monitoring wells or devices is not less than 0.01 cm/s\n(\ne.g., the soil should consist of gravels, coarse to medium\nsands, coarse silts, or other permeable materials). (iii)\n\nThe slotted portion of the monitoring\nwell casing is designed to prevent migration of natural soils or filter pack\ninto the well and to allow entry of petroleum on the water table into the well\nunder both high and low groundwater conditions. (iv)\n\nMonitoring wells are sealed from the\nground surface to the top of the filter pack. (v) Monitoring wells or devices intercept the\nexcavation zone or are as close to it as is technically feasible. (vi)\n\nThe continuous electronic monitoring\ndevices or manual methods used can detect the presence of at least one-eighth\nof an inch of free product on top of the groundwater in the monitoring\nwells. (vii)\n\nWithin and immediately\nbelow the UST system excavation zone, the site is assessed to ensure compliance\nwith the requirements of subparagraphs (i) through (v) of this paragraph and to\nestablish the number and positioning of monitoring wells or devices that will\ndetect leaks from any portion of the tank that routinely contains petroleum. Assessments developed after October 13, 2015 must be signed by a professional\nengineer or professional geologist licensed and registered in New York State\n(by the New York State Education Department under Title 8 of Article 145 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law, entitled \"Engineering, Land Surveying, and\n\nGeology\").

Interstitial monitoring between the primary and secondary containment may be\nused if the monitoring equipment is designed, constructed, and installed to\ndetect a leak from any portion of the tank that routinely contains petroleum, and if the monitoring equipment meets the requirements of either subparagraph\n(i), (ii), or (iii) of this paragraph: (i) For\na double-walled tank, the sampling or testing method: (a) can detect a leak through the inner wall\nin any portion of the tank that routinely contains petroleum; and\n(b) is capable of detecting a breach in both\nthe inner and outer walls of the tank if using continuous vacuum, pressure, or\nliquid-filled methods of interstitial monitoring. (ii)\n\nFor a UST system with secondary\ncontainment within the excavation zone, the sampling or testing method can\ndetect a leak between the primary and secondary containment, and the following\nconditions are met: (a) The secondary\ncontainment consists of artificially constructed material that is sufficiently\nthick and impermeable (\ni.e., with a permeability rate to water\nequal to or less than 1x10\n-6\ncm/s) to direct a leak\nto the monitoring point and permit its detection. (b) The secondary containment is compatible\nwith the petroleum stored so that a leak from the UST system will not cause a\ndeterioration of the secondary containment, allowing a leak to pass through\nundetected. (c) For cathodically\nprotected tanks, the secondary containment is installed so that it does not\ninterfere with the proper operation of the cathodic protection\nsystem. (d) The groundwater, soil\nmoisture, or rainfall will not render the testing or sampling method\ninoperative so that a leak could go undetected for more than seven\ndays. (e) The site is assessed to\nensure that the secondary containment is always above the groundwater and not\nin a 25-year flood plain, unless the secondary containment and monitoring\ndesigns are for use under such conditions. (f) Monitoring wells are clearly marked in\naccordance with paragraph 2.2(d)(3) of this Subpart and secured to avoid\nunauthorized access and tampering.
