The public records of the corporation shall be available for\ninspection and copying Monday through Friday, except legal holidays, between\nthe hours of 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. Requests may be submitted to: Records Access Officer\n\nNew York State Higher Education\n\nServices Corporation\n99 Washington Avenue\n\nOne Commerce Plaza\n\nAlbany, NY 12255\n(b) Trade secrets. (1)\n\nAny person who submits any information to\nthe corporation may, at the time of such submission, request that the\ncorporation exempt such information from disclosure on the basis that it is a\ntrade secret or is maintained by the corporation for the regulation of\ncommercial enterprise and which, if disclosed, would cause substantial injury\nto the competitive position of the entity making such request. (2)\n\nSuch request from disclosure shall: (i) be in writing; (ii)\nbe submitted simultaneous with or prior\nto the information which is the subject of the request; and\n(iii)\nstate the reasons why the information\nshould be excepted from disclosure. Where the request itself contains information which if\ndisclosed would defeat the purpose for which the exception is sought, such\ninformation shall also be excepted from disclosure. (3)\n\nInformation which is the\nsubject of a request made pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision is\nexcepted from disclosure until 15 days after entitlement status has been\nfinally determined or, when entitlement to an exception from disclosure has\nbeen granted, until such entitlement has expired, or until such further time as\nordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. (4)\n\nOn the initiative of the records access\nofficer at any time, or upon the request of any person for a record excepted\nfrom disclosure pursuant to this subdivision, the corporation shall: (i) inform the person who requested the\nexception of the corporation's intention to determine whether such exception\nshould be granted or continued; (ii)\npermit the person who requested the\nexception, within 10 business days of receipt of notification from the\ncorporation, to submit a written statement of the necessity for the granting or\ncontinuation of such exception; and\n(iii)\nwithin seven business days of receipt\nof such written statement, or within seven business days of the expiration of\nthe period prescribed for submission of such statement, issue a written\ndetermination granting, continuing or terminating such exception and stating\nthe reasons therefor; copies of such determination shall be served upon the\nperson, if any, requesting the record, the person who requested the exception, and the Committee on Open Government. (5)\n\nIf a request for access to the record has\nnot been received by the corporation at the time a request for exception is\nunder consideration, the records access officer, in his or her discretion, may\nwithhold the determination as to the exception until an access request has been\nreceived. (6)\nA denial of an\nexception from disclosure under this subdivision may be appealed by the person\nsubmitting the information, and a denial of access to the record may be\nappealed by the person requesting the record in accordance with the provisions\nof Public Officers Law, section 89.5(c). (7)\n\nInformation excepted from disclosure\npursuant to this subdivision, or as to which a request for such an exception\nhas been made and a final determination has not as yet been had, shall be\nmaintained apart from other documents in a locked file cabinet, locked desk\ndrawer or other place secure from general access. Such records shall be placed\nin envelopes with flaps, or other containers which will effectively maintain\nthe integrity of the documents and which can be marked so as to clearly limit\naccess to the contents. Such records shall be in the custody of the head of the\ndivision or office with which the record is filed. That person shall specify, in writing, which persons subject to his or her supervision may inspect such\nrecords. Only that person, those he or she so specifies, the records access\nofficer and the records access appeals officer shall be entitled to access to\nsuch records. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
