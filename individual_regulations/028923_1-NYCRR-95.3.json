  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 95.3 - Interpretation of terms used\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn interpreting the terms used in this Act in regard to the\nsale of unlabeled, uncleaned, and unfit seed the definitions and explanations\nformulated by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets shall apply. (a) \"Unlabeled\" seed shall be understood to\nmean lots or parcels of seeds or mixtures of seeds which lack any or all of the\nrequired items of label information for that particular kind of seed or\nmixture. (b) Seed \"so unclean as to\nbe unfit for planting\" shall be understood to mean that the seed has not been\nsubjected to the usual commercial cleaning processes to remove harmful and\ntroublesome weed seeds in such quantities that it might badly infest a field in\nwhich it was planted. Seeds of wheat, oats, rye, barley, and other seeds of\nsimilar size or larger will be considered to be \"so unclean as to be unfit for\nplanting\" if they contain 10 noxious weed seeds or more per pound. Seeds of\ngrasses, small-seeded legumes, and all other seeds smaller in size than wheat\nwill be considered to be unfit for planting if they contain noxious weed seeds\nat a rate of 100 seeds or more per pound, except that lawn seed or lawn seeding\nmixtures containing annual bluegrass (Poa annua) will be considered fit for\nplanting provided (1) that the name and number of annual bluegrass (Poa\nannua)seeds per pound is stated on the label as required by paragraph 5. of\nsubdivision C. of section\n137\nof the Agriculture and Markets Law, or (2) that annual bluegrass (Poa annua) be\nlisted on the label as a component crop seed of the lawn seed or lawn seeding\nmixture and that the percentage by weight and percentage of germination be\nshown. (c) Agricultural seeds will\nbe considered to be \"so weak or low in germination as to be unfit for seeding\npurposes\" if the percentage germination obtained in a standard laboratory test\nis less than two thirds of the minimum germination percentage specified for\ncertified seed of the kind in question in the latest minimum standards adopted\nby the International Crop Improvement Association. Vegetable and flower seeds\nwill be considered to be unfit for planting if the germination percentage\nobtained in a standard laboratory test is less than two thirds of the\ngermination standard for the kind in question specified in these rules and\nregulations. Seeds of kinds not listed in the minimum certification standards\nof the International Crop Improvement Association nor in the vegetable and\nflower seed standards set forth in these rules and regulations will be\nconsidered to be unfit for planting if they show no germination or distinctly\nweak vitality, or produce so few seedlings as to make a satisfactory stand in\nthe field impossible at normal planting rates. (d) Seed shall not be considered to have been\npackaged or tested for the calendar year in which it is sold, offered or\nexposed for sale unless a test to determine the percentage germination shall\nhave been made during the nine-month period immediately preceding the date on\nwhich the seed is sold, offered or exposed for sale. (e) The term \"standard testing procedures\" as\nused in this article shall be understood to mean procedures adopted by the\n\nAssociation of Official Seed Analysts and published in the most recent edition\nof the \"Rules for Testing Seed\" of that Association. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n95.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
