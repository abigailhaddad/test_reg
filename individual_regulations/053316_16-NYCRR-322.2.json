  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 322.2 - Additions and retirements of gas plant\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose of avoiding undue\nrefinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of\ngas plant, all property shall be considered as consisting of (1) units of\nproperty or retirement units and (2) minor items. Units of property means those\nitems of gas plant which are sufficiently distinct or important so that when\nthey are retired with or without being replaced by other units of the same type\nor use, they are accounted for by crediting the amount at which they are\ncarried on the books to the gas plant account in which included. All other\nitems are to be considered as minor items. These retirement units should not be\nconfused with continuing property record units filed by Class C utilities; the\nlatter are units for which the cost will be shown separately in the continuing\nproperty records. Whenever units of property are mentioned in this system of\naccounts, the term refers to retirement units and not to continuing property\nrecord units. Each utility may adopt its own list of units of property for the\npurpose of this instruction until such time as the commission shall prescribe a\nlist of units. (b) Units of\nproperty. (1)\n\nWhen a unit of property is added\nto gas plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the appropriate gas plant\naccount. (2)\n\nWhen a unit of\nproperty is retired from gas plant (i.e., is removed, sold, abandoned, destroyed or otherwise ceases to be used or useful in gas service), whether or\nnot replaced by another unit of the same type or use, the amount at which it is\ncarried on the books shall be credited to the gas plant account in which it is\nincluded (determined in the manner set forth in subd. [d], below) and charged\nto the depreciation reserve provided for such property. (c) Minor items of property. (1)\n\nWhen a minor item of property which does\nnot replace a similar item is added to gas plant, the cost thereof shall be\ncharged to the appropriate maintenance account and no entry shall be made in\nthe gas plant or depreciation reserve accounts. (2)\n\nWhen a minor item is retired and replaced\nindependently of the unit of property of which it is a part, the cost of\nreplacement shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance account and no\nentry shall be made in the gas plant or depreciation reserve\naccounts. (3)\n\nWhen a minor item the\nbook cost of which does not exceed $50 is retired and not replaced, if the book\ncost of such minor item is included with or spread over one or more units of\nproperty so that it will be accounted for through the retirement of such one or\nmore units of property, no separate credit to the gas plant account shall be\nmade; otherwise, however, the book cost of such minor item shall be credited to\nthe appropriate gas plant account and charged to account 1250, Reserve for\n\nDepreciation of Utility Plant. Note: For example, if a given length of main, including\nall fittings, valves, drip pots, etc., is a unit and the cost of such section\nof main includes the cost of the valves, drip pots, etc., no separate credit to\nthe plant account shall be made when a drip pot or valve (the book cost of\nwhich is less than $50) is retired even though not replaced. Any labor in\nconnection with the removal shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance\naccount, and any salvage for material recovered shall be credited to the\nappropriate maintenance account. (d) Determination of amount to be credited to\nplant accounts. Gas plant retired shall be credited to the plant accounts at\nthe amount at which such property is included therein, including all components\nof construction costs, such as engineering, supervision, interest and taxes\nduring construction, etc. The amount shall be determined from the utility's\nrecords and if this can not be done, it shall be estimated. When it is\nimpracticable to determine the amount carried on the books for each item, due\nto the relatively large number or small cost thereof, the average of such\nitems, with due allowances for any differences in size, character, and year of\ninstallation (if known), shall be used. (e) Land retired. When land is retired the\namount at which it is carried on the books shall be credited to the appropriate\nland account. If the land is sold, the difference between the amount at which\nit is carried on the books and the sale price of the land (less commissions and\nother expenses of making the sale) shall be credited or debited to account\n1250, Reserve for Depreciation of Utility Plant.
