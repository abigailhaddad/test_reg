  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 352.17 - Definition and computation of earned income\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Earned income means income in cash or in\nkind earned by an individual through the receipt of wages, salary, commissions, or profit from activities in which he/she is engaged as a self-employed\nindividual or as an employee. Such earned income may be derived from his/her\nown employment such as a business enterprise or farming; or derived from wages\nor salary received as an employee. It may include earnings over a period of\ntime for which settlement is made at one given time, as in the instance of\nsales of farm crops, livestock or poultry. Income received by an individual on\na contractual basis or income received intermittently on a quarterly, semiannual or yearly basis must be prorated over the period of the contract or\nthe period covered by the income with appropriate monthly exclusions. (1)\n\nWith reference to commissions, wages or\nsalary, the term earned income means gross earned income prior to deduction of\nany taxes or other personal and nonpersonal expenses incident to\nemployment. (2)\n\nWith respect to\nself-employment, the term earned income means the total profit from a business\nenterprise, farming, etc., resulting from the gross income received less the\nbusiness expenses, i.e.,total cost of the production of the income as defined\nin paragraph (b)(2) of this section. (b) Computation of net applicable income. (1)\n\nIn computing the amount of net applicable\nincome to be applied against the estimate of needs, the following must be\napplied sequentially: (i) the applicable\namount of exempt earned income; and\n(ii)\nthe prescribed work expense disregard. The net amount remaining must be applied against public\nassistance needs in determining the amount of the assistance payment. (2)\n\nFor self-employed\nindividuals, those expenses directly related to producing the goods or\nservices, including expenses for inventory, and without which the goods or\nservices could not be produced must be excluded to determine the amount of\nearned income. However, depreciation, personal business and entertainment\nexpenses, personal transportation, purchase of capital equipment, and payments\non the principal of loans for capital assets or durable goods are not\nexcluded. (3)\n\nWhere the gross\nproperty cost of client-owned property used as the home exceeds the gross rent\nreceipts, the difference is the public assistance recipient' s shelter need\nthat is payable up to the agency maximum. When the gross rent received exceeds\nthe gross property cost, the difference is earned income from self-employment\nand no amount is included as a shelter item in the client's budget estimate of\nneed. (c) Projecting\naverage income. The amount of earned income used to determine the public\nassistance grant will be based on an estimate of average monthly earnings. To\nproject average monthly income, the social services district must average the\nmost recent four weeks of earned income, or if there has been a change expected\nto last at least 30 days, use the new information regarding the amount of pay\nand the frequency of pay. (d) Average monthly earned income is applied against need to determine the grant\namount for each calendar month of an authorization period. The amount of\naverage earned income applied must be recalculated at recertification. No other\nadjustments will be made, except as provided in section\n352.31\n(c) of this\n\nPart, unless one of the following occurs: loss of employment; change in status of the recipient from part-time to\nfull-time employment or the converse; increase or decrease in income expected to last at least\n30 days; increase or decrease in number of hours worked per pay\nperiod expected to last at least 30 days; or receipt of income from an\nadditional source of any kind. (e) The recipient must report and certify any\nchanges in employment status which are set forth in subdivision (d) of this\nsection. The social services district must adjust the grant beginning with the\nmonth in which the change occurred. However, when a report of a new or\nincreased earned income is made timely by the recipient, the district must\nadjust the grant or calculate the amount of any overpayment only after a\nreasonable administrative processing period has passed. A reasonable\nadministrative processing period means the semi-monthly payment cycle in which\nthe initial or increased earnings began and the following semi-monthly payment\ncycle. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
