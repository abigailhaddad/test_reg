  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 360-5.9 - Trial work period\n\nState Regulations\n\nPersons determined to be disabled may be entitled to a\ntrial work period during which they retain their disability status. (a) Definition of services. For the purposes\nof this section, the term services means activity in employment or\nself-employment which is performed for remuneration or gain or is determined to\nbe a type normally performed for remuneration or gain. Inasmuch as the trial\nwork provision is intended to give a disabled beneficiary the opportunity to\ntest his/her ability to work and hold a job, minor work activity may generally\nbe disregarded. Therefore, work activity in employment in a month will\nconstitute services only if it is actually or usually performed for\nremuneration or gain amounting to more than $50, either in cash or in-kind. Work activity in self-employment will be determined to be services only where\nnet earnings in a calendar month are more than $50 for a month or the\nself-employed person spends more than 15 hours in that month in the work\nactivity. In some self-employed cases, it may not be possible to isolate from\nthe total net earnings the net earnings for each particular month of\nself-employment. When this occurs, divide the net earnings for the particular\nwork period by the months of self-employment to find net earnings per month. Cases where remuneration for employment is in the form of commissions should be\nhandled in a similar manner. (b) Activity which does not constitute services for purpose of charging trial work\nperiod months. Activity performed by a beneficiary for which payment in excess\nof $50 a month is made does not constitute services if the activity, although\nresembling services in employment for remuneration or gain, is: (1)\npart of a prescribed program of medical\ntherapy; (2)\ncarried out in a\nhospital under the supervision of medical and administrative staff; (3)\nnot performed in an employer-employee\nrelationship; or\n(4)\nnot normally\nperformed for remuneration or gain. (c) An individual who is still medically\nseverely impaired may render services in as many as nine calendar months (not\nnecessarily consecutive) during which his/her work, regardless of the\nmagnitude, will not be the sole consideration in determining whether disability\nhas ceased. After nine months of services, if the individual's medical\ncondition has not improved, this work will be considered in determining whether\nhe/she has demonstrated an ability to engage in substantial gainful activity as\ndefined in section\n360-5.2\nof this Subpart. After the\nend of the trial work period, any work (including the services rendered during\nany of the nine months) may be considered in determining whether he/she is able\nto engage in substantial gainful activity in any month thereafter. (d) Investigation before end of the trial\nwork period. If the medical evidence upon which the initial disability\ndetermination is based indicates some likelihood of recovery from the\nimpairment, a return to work before the month the certificate expires will be\nconsidered as a possible indication of medical recovery. If it cannot\nreasonably be determined from the medical evidence in the file and from an\ninterview whether the client is still disabled, the agency should secure\nadditional medical evidence. If the evidence reveals the individual has\nrecovered from his/her impairment, disability status will cease in the month\nestablished by current medical evidence. If the medical evidence obtained\nreveals the individual is still disabled, an approval will be prepared and\nhis/her case will not be investigated again until after his/her trial period or\nwhen a subsequent medical reexamination (group II) becomes due or when\naffirmative evidence of medical recovery is received, whichever date is\nearliest. Affirmative evidence of medical recovery may include a report from a\nphysician, hospital, clinic, etc., indicating recovery. (e) Investigation after end of trial work\nperiod. Most disability clients have impairments which, by their nature, are\neither static or progressive. Since medical recovery is not expected, a return\nto work under these circumstances is not considered an indication of the\npossibility of medical recovery. An investigation in this type of case will not\nbe started until the individual has worked in at least nine months of or\naffirmative action of medical recovery is received before nine months of\nservices have been rendered.
