  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-8.2 - Netting\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis section sets forth the procedures for avoiding a NSR\nmajor modification, for all regulated NSR contaminants other than GHGs, where\nthe proposed modification exceeds the significant project threshold(s) but does\nnot result in a significant net emission increase. (a) 'General requirements'. (1)\nA net emission increase determination\nshall be confined to the appropriate contemporaneous period for a proposed\nmodification. (2)\nA net emission\nincrease determination will only be allowed at an existing major\nfacility. (3)\n\nAny creditable\nemission increase or ERC must be of the same class of regulated NSR\ncontaminant. For example, only NO\nx\nemissions shall be\nused for netting of new NO\nx\nemissions, only PM-2.5 shall\nbe used for netting of new PM-2.5 emissions. (4)\n\nAny creditable emission increase or ERC\nwhich is used in a net emission increase determination must occur at the same\nmajor facility as the proposed modification. (b) 'Permit requirements for netting'. A\nfacility owner or operator which proposes a modification that does not result\nin a significant net emission increase, must: (1)\napply for and obtain a permit which\nestablishes an emission limit that equals the projected actual emissions or\npotential to emit, as appropriate, of the modification of each regulated NSR\ncontaminant(s) which exceed(s) the applicable significant project\nthreshold; (2)\napply for and obtain\na permit which establishes the ERCs relied on for the net emission increase\ndetermination, if the ERCs are not already approved by the\ndepartment; (3)\nsubmit a use of\nemission reduction credits form (duly completed and signed by the applicant)\nfor each source of ERCs to be used for netting; (4)\napply for and obtain a permit which\ncomplies with any additional requirements of Subpart 231-11 of this\n\nPart. (c) 'Re-evaluation\nof a prior net emission increase determination at a facility that was not\nsignificant'. The facility owner or operator must reevaluate the determination\nof the net emission increase of a prior modification which did not result in a\nsignificant net emission increase if aproposed modification will commence\noperation within the contemporaneous period of the prior modification. The\nfacility owner or operator must recalculate the net emission increase of the\nprior modification at the facility by including the project emission potential\nof the proposed modification as a creditable emission increase. If the\nrecalculated net emission increase of the prior modification results in a\nsignificant net emission increase, taking into account the proposed\nmodification, the facility owner or operator must select one of the following\noptions: (1)\nsubmit a permit application and\naccept a condition prohibiting the proposed modification from commencing\noperation until after the close of the contemporaneous period for the\npreviously permitted modification; or\n(2)\ncreate additional ERCs according to the\nprovisions of Subpart 231-10 of this Part at the facility in an amount which\nensures that the net emission increase of the prior modification, after taking\ninto account the creditable emission increase of the proposed modification does\nnot result in a significant net emission increase; or\n(3)\nsubmit an application requesting\nmodification of the permit for the prior modification which reflects\napplicability of this Subpart. The facility owner or operator may not begin\nactual construction of the prior modification or begin operation until the\ndepartment approves the application and issues a permit which incorporates the\nrequirements of this Subpart.
