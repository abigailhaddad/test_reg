Such factors include whether\nthere is a substantial probability that the respondent would not be likely to\nappear in court if released, whether he or she would be likely to benefit from\ndiversion services, whether all available alternatives to detention have been\nexhausted and, in the case of a child 16 years of age or older, whether special\ncircumstances exist warranting detention. The diversion agency shall also\ngather information to aid the court in its determination of whether remaining\nin the home would be contrary to the child's best interests and, where\nappropriate, whether reasonable efforts were made to prevent or eliminate the\nneed for removal of the child from his or her home.
