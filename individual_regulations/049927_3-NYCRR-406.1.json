  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 406.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis Part contains regulations relating to the transmission\nof money by licensees and their agents under article XIII-B of the Banking Law. For purposes of this Part, the business of transmission of money will be\ndivided into three categories: the issuance and sale of travelers checks to the\npublic, the sale and issuance of money orders to the public, and the\ntransmission of money on behalf of the public by any and all other means or\nmanner including but not limited to transmissions within this country or to\nlocations abroad by wire, check, draft, facsimile or courier. Although a number\nof the subdivisions of this Part apply to all licensees and their agents and\nsubagents, other subdivisions apply exclusively to those transmission\nactivities that fall within the scope of the third category of transmission. As\nprovided in Banking Law, section 641, the provisions contained in this Part\nshall not apply to an agent of a payee as defined in section\n406.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart. Only agents of a payee which do not engage in any money transmission\nactivities other than as an agent of a payee are exempt from the provisions of\nthis Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n406.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
