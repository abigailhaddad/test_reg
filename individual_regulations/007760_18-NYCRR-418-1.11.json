Tit. 18 §§ 418-1.11 - Health and infection control\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Child enrollment requirements for\nchildren not enrolled in kindergarten or a higher grade. (1)\n\nNo child may be accepted for care in a\nchild care program unless the program has been furnished with a written\nstatement signed by a health care provider verifying that the child is able to\nparticipate in child care and currently appears to be free from contagious or\ncommunicable diseases. A child's medical statement must have been completed\nwithin the 12 months preceding the date of enrollment. (2)\n\nThe written medical statement from the\nhealth care provider must also state whether the child is a child with special\nhealth care needs and, if so, what special provisions, if any, will be\nnecessary in order for the child to participate in child day care. When the\nwritten statement from the health care provider advises the day care program\nthat the child being enrolled is a child with special health care needs, the\nday care program must work together with the parent and the child's health care\nprovider to develop a reasonable health care plan for the child while the child\nis in the child day care program. The health care plan for the child must also\naddress how the day care program will obtain or develop any additional\ncompetencies that the staff will need to have in order to carry out the health\ncare plan for the child. (3)\n\nThe\nprogram must keep documentation of immunizations the child has received to\ndate, in accordance with New York Public Health Law. (4)\nA program may admit any child not yet\nimmunized provided the child's immunizations are in process and the parent\ngives the program specific appointment dates for required immunizations in\naccordance with the requirements of New York Public Health Law. (5)\n[\nReserved\n]. (6)\n\nAny child who is missing one or more of\nthe required immunizations may be admitted if a physician licensed to practice\nmedicine in New York State furnishes the program with a signed, completed\nmedical exemption form issued by the New York State Department of Health or New\n\nYork City Department of Education.

(8)\n\nThe program must try to obtain a copy of a lead screening certificate for each\nchild under the age of six years. If the parent does not have one, the program\nmay not exclude the child from child day care, but must give the parent\ninformation on lead poisoning and prevention, and refer the parent to the\nchild's health care provider or the local health department for a lead blood\nscreening test. (b) Staff and volunteers health requirements.

(2)\n\nShould the health care\nconsultant determine, after a visit to the day care program, that the approved\nhealth care plan is not being reasonably followed by the program, the health\ncare consultant may revoke his or her approval of the plan. If the health care\nconsultant revokes his or her approval of the health care plan, the health care\nconsultant must immediately notify the licensee and the licensee must\nimmediately notify the office, no longer than 24 hours later.
