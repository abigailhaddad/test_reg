(b) In this connection, each racing\nassociation, other than a nonprofit racing association shall by January 31st of\nthe current year file with the commission schedules of expenditures made during\nthe preceding calendar year segregated by expenditures for capital\nimprovements, eligible repairs and special events. Such schedules shall be in\nsummary form identifying each asset or special event by appropriate name, the\ntotal expended for each asset or special event, and the date of completion for\nuse for such asset or the date each special event was held. Copies of bills, invoices and other supporting documentation providing details of such\nexpenditures shall be retained by the track for audit by the\ncommission. (c) To qualify as\neligible repairs, expenditures must be for work or materials necessary to put\ninoperative assets back into good operating condition; in addition, the\nreplacement of parts, the fixing of plant, overhaul of equipment, and similar\nwork that ordinarily would not qualify as capital expenditures because the life\nof the asset is not thereby extended shall nevertheless qualify as eligible\nrepairs. Maintenance expenditures, incurred for the purpose of keeping assets\nin operating condition are excluded. (d) In determining whether the necessary\namounts have been expended, the commission shall consider the preceding\ncalendar year or the average of the two preceding calendar years, whichever is\nhigher. It shall be presumed that only expenditures submitted in the form\nrequired in subdivision (b) of this section are expenditures qualified for\nconsideration by the commission. (e) If the commission determines that such\nracing association or corporation has failed to make the total of expenditures\nas established by statue, the commission shall notify the affected association\nor corporation of the commission's determination by February 20th of the\ncurrent year and schedule a date within 15 days thereof to hear the association\nor corporation in regard to the commission's determination. (f) Copies of any certification made in\naccordance with subdivision (a) of this section shall be served upon the\naffected association or corporation by the date prescribed in such subdivision\n(a).
