  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 195.3 - Definitions of terms\n\nState Regulations\n\nAs used in this Subchapter: (a) Mature means that the grapes are juicy, palatable, and have reached that stage of development at which the skin of the\nberry easily separates from the pulp. Frozen, or slightly frosted stock should\nnot be confused with mature stock. (b) Well colored means that the berries shall\nshow full color characteristic of the variety. (c) Fairly well colored means that not less\nthan 75 percent, by weight, shall show full color characteristic of the\nvariety. Twenty five percent may show partially or poorly colored berries which\nare not characteristic of immature berries. (d) Shattered berries means berries which\nhave separated from the bunch. (e) Compact bunches means well filled bunches, with no open spaces. (f) Fairly compact means that the bunches are\nwell filled but that the berries are not closely spaced as in \"compact\nbunches.\"\n(g) Damage means any\ninjury which materially affects the appearance or the edible or shipping\nquality. Mildew which affects the appearance of the berries shall be considered\nas damage, but berries shall not be regarded as damaged by mildew which are\nfirmly attached to the stems and which have only slight traces of mildew on the\ninside of the bunch where it does not affect the appearance of the\nberries. (h) Serious damage means\nthat the defects taken singly or collectively seriously affect the market\nquality. (i) Straggly means a\ndecidedly open bunch with large open spaces and very few berries. Small, immature shotberries, characteristic of the Worden variety, should be\ndisregarded unless they are excessive in number and detract materially from the\nappearance of the lot. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n195.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
