  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 347.3 - Rationale\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The purpose of\nthe probation department is to protect the safety and property of persons by\nprevention of juvenile delinquency and adult crime and related family\nmalfunctioning, with maximum effectiveness and at reasonable cost. (b) Probation is concerned with assisting\nindividuals and families through a full range of services to avoid behavior\nwhich caused their original difficulties. (c) In the broadest context, management of\nprobation operations includes the participation of those executives and\nlegislators who have responsibility for determination of the laws, policies, staffing and budgets for the probation department. Probation administrators\nmust be effective in their relationships and dealings with executives and\nlegislators. (d) Probation\nmanagement must share with the community in identifying and developing\nresources and innovative programs for prevention of crime and\ndelinquency. (e) Another important\nmanagement perspective is the organization and coordination of all levels of\nemployees of the probation department in the execution of probation\nfunctions. (f) A body of sound\nmanagement knowledge and practice, expressed in \"rules\", has been developed\nthrough long experience of both private industry and government. It is\nimportant that the employees of the probation organization understand and apply\nthe \"rules\" of sound probation management. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n347.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
