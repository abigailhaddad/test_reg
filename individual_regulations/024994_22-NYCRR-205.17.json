If the child has a sibling or half-sibling removed from the home, whose\npermanency hearing is scheduled before this court, the date certain shall be\nthe same as the date certain for the sibling's or half-sibling's permanency\nhearing, unless the sibling or half-sibling was removed on a juvenile\ndelinquency or person in need of supervision petition or unless either sibling\nhas been freed for adoption.

(4)\n\nEach\npermanency hearing order must contain a date certain for the next permanency\nhearing, which shall be not more than six months following the completion of\nthe permanency hearing, except as provided in paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision. Except with respect to a child freed for adoption, if the child\nhas a sibling or half-sibling removed from the home, whose permanency hearing\nis scheduled before this court, the date certain shall be the same as the date\ncertain for the sibling's or half-sibling's permanency hearing, unless the\nsibling or half-sibling was removed on a juvenile delinquency or person in need\nof supervision petition or unless either sibling has been freed for\nadoption. (5)\n\nIf the\nchild has been adopted or has been the subject of a final order of discharge or\ncustody or guardianship by the scheduled date certain, the permanency hearing\nshall be cancelled and the petitioner shall promptly so notify the court, all\nparties and their attorneys, including the child's attorney, as well as all\nindividuals required to be notified of the hearing pursuant to Family Court\n\nAct, section\n1089.

The court shall give such persons an opportunity to be heard, but they shall not be considered parties and their failures to appear shall not\nconstitute cause to delay the hearing. As provided in subdivision (d) of this\nsection, the petitioner shall submit on or before the return date documentation\nof the notice or notices given to the respondent and non-respondent parents, their attorneys, the child's attorney, and any present or former foster parent, pre-adoptive parent or relative.

The copies of\nthe permanency hearing report required to be sent to the parties and their\nattorneys, including the child's attorney, not less than 14 days prior to the\nscheduled date certain need not be sworn so long as the verification\naccompanying the Family Court's sworn copy attests to the fact that the copies\ntransmitted were identical in all other respects to the court's sworn\ncopy.
