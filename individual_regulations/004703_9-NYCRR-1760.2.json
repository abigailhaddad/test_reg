  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1760.2 - Grounds for approval of refinance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In reviewing a request to refinance, the\ndivision may consider various factors including but not limited to the fact\nthat the refinance will: (1)\nreduce debt\nservice in order to minimize increases in rent or maintenance; (2)\nraise additional funds for current\ncapital improvements; (3)\nbolster\nreserve funds for future capital improvements; (4)\nfacilitate a redevelopment plan involving\nnew sources of funding; (5)\npermit\ncontinuation of the real property tax exemption; (6)\npermit continuation of existing loans, grants, or subsidies. (b) In order to facilitate an approved\nrefinance, the division may consent to modify its supervision to avoid\nunnecessary duplication with other subsidy programs or supervising agencies, allow the lender greater participation in the supervision of the housing\ncompany's use of loan proceeds and reserve and escrow funds, and avoid undue\nregulatory burden upon the housing company. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n1760.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
