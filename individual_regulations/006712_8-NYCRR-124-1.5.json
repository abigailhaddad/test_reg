(b) To the extent that holidays are provided\nby the BOCES to the district superintendent that exceed those made available to\nmanagement/ confidential employees of the state, the district superintendent\nshall be entitled to such holidays provided they make themself available to\ncarry out responsibilities at the direction of the Commissioner on those\ndays.

For the latter, the value of unused sick leave shall\nbe converted to a monthly credit, which is applied toward paying any\ncontribution the employee makes for health insurance for the rest of his or her\nlife. Such benefit shall be at the expense of the BOCES, unless the district\nsuperintendent is enrolled in the New York State Health Insurance Program\n(NYSHIP) at the time of separation, and shall not apply to the salary\ncap.

(f) District\nsuperintendents shall not be eligible for enrollment in the\nmanagement/confidential Income Protection Plan (IPP). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
