Tit. 2 § 72.1 - Report of open estates administered by public administrators of the counties within the city of new york\n\nState Regulations\n(a) As used\nin this Part, the term public administrator shall mean the public administrator\nof any county in which the office of public administrator exists or any deputy\npublic administrator or other individual who is performing the duties of the\npublic administrator as provided for by law. (b) Whenever the estate of a decedent is\nbeing administered by a public administrator pursuant to article 11 of the\n\nSurrogate's Court Procedure Act, and such estate has not been fully distributed\nnor a final accounting filed with petition for settlement with the appropriate\n\nSurrogate's Court, the public administrator shall annually in the month of\n\nJanuary file a Report of Open Estates with the office of the State Comptroller, covering every open estate in respect to which permanent letters of\nadministration were issued to such public administrator on or before the\npreceding December 31st. The Report of Open Estates shall be submitted on a\nform prescribed by the State Comptroller and shall include the name of the\nestate; the date letters were granted; the amount of the gross estate; the\namount undistributed; reasons why final distribution of the estate has not been\nmade; the anticipated estate closing date and such additional information as\nthe State Comptroller may deem warranted. If there are no such open estates, a\nreport must be filed by the public administrator indicating that no estates are\nopen. (c) The State Comptroller may\nconsider failure to timely file any report provided for herein as grounds for\npetitioning the Surrogate of the county having jurisdiction, praying for a\njudicial settlement of the accounts of any such public administrator, pursuant\nto the provisions of section\n8\n(11)\nof the State Finance Law. (d) The periods set forth in subdivision (b)\nof this section are not intended to set a standard time for completion of\nestate administration, but rather to fix the times within which the State\n\nComptroller is to be informed of the status of open estates. (e) This section shall not limit the power of\nthe Surrogate's Court to direct an accounting at any time on its own initiative\nor on petition pursuant to section\n2205\nof the Surrogate's Court Procedure\n\nAct. (f) No open estate shall be\nexcluded from the applicability of the provisions of this section by virtue of\nthe fact that permanent letters of administration were issued to the public\nadministrator prior to the effective date of this regulation.
