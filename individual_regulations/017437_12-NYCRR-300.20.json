The parties in interest may by agreement or\nstipulation designate the person before whom such claimants are to appear and\nsubmit to examination, in which case the parties shall notify the board of such\ndesignation on a form prescribed by the chairman. In the absence of such\nagreement or stipulation and on application of any party in interest the board\nshall designate the person before whom appearance is to be made and testimony\ntaken.

Where testimony is given orally before such\nofficer or designated person, he shall make or cause to be made a full and\ncomplete record of the proceedings. Where oral examination is provided, the\nparties may be represented.
