Blank forms of such applications shall be furnished by the Chief\n\nAdministrator without charge to all persons requesting the same. The Chief\n\nAdministrator may require in connection with such application such information\nas the good of the service may require. (d) Disqualification of applicants or\neligibles. (1)\n\nThe Chief\n\nAdministrator of the Courts may refuse to examine an applicant, or after\nexamination to include a candidate on the eligible list, or may remove or\nrestrict from the eligible list, or may refuse to appoint, an applicant or\neligible: (i) who is found to\nlack any of the established requirements for admission to the examination or\nfor appointment to the position for which he or she applies; or\n(ii)\nwho is found to have a\nphysical or mental disability which renders him or her unfit for the\nperformance, with or without reasonable accommodation, of the essential\nfunctions of the position in which he or she seeks employment, or which creates\na significant risk to the health or safety of the individual or of others that\ncannot be eliminated with reasonable accommodation; or\n(iii)\nwho has been guilty of a\ncrime; or\n(iv)\nwho\nhas been dismissed from a permanent position in the public service upon stated\nwritten charges of incompetency or misconduct, after an opportunity to answer\nsuch charges in writing, or who has resigned from, or whose service has\notherwise been terminated in, a permanent or temporary position in the public\nservice, where it is found after appropriate investigation or inquiry that such\nresignation or termination resulted from his or her incompetency or misconduct; or\n(v) who has\nintentionally made a false statement of any material fact in his or her\napplication; or\n(vi)\nwho has practiced, or attempted to practice, any deception or fraud in his or\nher application, in his or her examination, or in securing eligibility or\nappointment; or\n(vii)\nwho has been dismissed from private employment because of poor performance, incompetency or misconduct; or\n(viii)\nwho lacks good moral character; or\n(ix)\nwho has a\nrecord of disrespect for the requirements and processes of law, including\nrepeated traffic offenses or disregard of summonses for traffic\noffenses. (2)\n\nNo person shall be disqualified\npursuant to this subdivision unless he or she has been given a written\nstatement of the reasons therefor and afforded an opportunity to make an\nexplanation and to submit facts in opposition to such disqualification. The\napplicant shall have the burden of establishing his or her qualifications to\nthe satisfaction of the Chief Administrator of the Courts. Any applicant who\nrefuses to permit the Chief Administrator to investigate matters necessary for\nthe verification of his or her qualifications or who otherwise hampers, impedes\nor fails to cooperate in such investigation shall be disqualified as set forth\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision\nof this Part, the Chief Administrator of the Courts may investigate the\nqualifications and background of an eligible after he or she has been appointed\nfrom the list, and upon finding facts which, if known prior to appointment, would have warranted his or her disqualification, or upon a finding of\nillegality, irregularity or fraud of a substantial nature in his or her\napplication, examination or appointment, may revoke such eligible's\ncertification and appointment and direct that his or her employment be\nterminated; provided, however, that no such certification shall be revoked or\nappointment terminated more than three years after it is made, except in the\ncase of fraud. (e) Application fees. The Chief\n\nAdministrator of the Courts may require applicants for any positions to pay\napplication and processing fees in a manner and amount prescribed by the Chief\n\nAdministrator. (f) Scope of examination. Examinations shall relate to those matters which will\nfairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the persons examined to\ndischarge the duties of that service into which they seek to be appointed. The\n\nChief Administrator of the Courts shall establish an eligible list on the basis\nof ratings received by the candidates in the competitive portions of the\nexamination, and may thereafter conduct medical, physical ability, psychological and other appropriate noncompetitive qualifying tests as\nrequired. (g) Examination of candidates unable to attend tests because of religious\nobservance. A person who, because of religious beliefs, is unable to attend and\ntake an examination scheduled to be held on a day which is a religious holiday\nobserved by such person shall be permitted to take such examination on some\nother day designated by the Chief Administrator of the Courts at a reasonable\ncomparable time and place without any additional fee or penalty. (h) Examinations of disabled\npersons. Where an applicant is not so physically or mentally disabled as to\nprevent him or her from satisfactorily performing, with or without reasonable\naccommodation, the essential functions of the position for which he or she is\napplying, to ensure competitive equality between the disabled person and\npersons not so disabled in connection with interviews and the taking of\nexaminations, the Chief Administrator, upon request, may furnish appropriate\nauxiliary aids or services and, when necessary, allow additional time for\nexaminations. (i) Residence requirements for Unified Court System positions. The Chief\n\nAdministrator of the Courts may prescribe residency requirements for positions\nin the Unified Court System. (j) Rating of examinations. (1)\n\nThe subjects of an\nexamination shall be given such relative weight as the Chief Administrator of\nthe Courts may prescribe; provided, however, that in a promotion examination, credit granted for seniority and for performance rating, may be applied by the\naddition of points to the scores earned by passed candidates who have passed\nall other parts of the examination. (2)\n\nAfter a candidate's rating has been\ndetermined, he or she shall be notified of such rating unless he or she has\notherwise been disqualified. (3)\n\nIn an examination in which the\nnumber of candidates is expected to greatly exceed the number of existing and\nanticipated vacancies, the Chief Administrator of the Courts may prescribe that\nthe passing mark shall be the lowest grade received among a certain fixed\nnumber of candidates graded highest in such examination or in any subject of\nsuch examination. Whenever the Chief Administrator shall determine upon such a\npassing mark in any examination or in any subject of an examination, notice\nthereof shall be set forth in the announcement of the examination. (4)\n\nThe Chief Administrator of\nthe Courts may authorize the use of any professionally recognized examination\nscoring and conversion methods, taking into consideration the type of\nexamination, the examination difficulty, the size of the applicant population\nin relation to the number of positions to be filled, labor market conditions, or other factors which can affect the number and quality of\neligibles. (k) Establishment of eligible lists. Every candidate who attains a passing mark in an examination as a whole and who\nmeets the standards prescribed, if any, for separate subjects or parts of\nsubjects of the examination shall be eligible for appointment to the position\nfor which he or she was examined, and his or her name shall be entered on the\neligible list in the order of his or her final rating; but if two or more\neligibles receive the same final rating in the examination, they shall be\nranked in accordance with such uniform, impartial procedure as may be\nprescribed therefor by the Chief Administrator of the Courts.
