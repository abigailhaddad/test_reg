  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 23 § 102.6 - Special Assessments\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen the superintendent shall determine that the expenses\nassociated with a specific examination, investigation or review are best\nallocated solely to the individual Licensee or Licensees subject to such\nexamination or investigation, rather than to all Licensees generally or any\nsubgroup thereof, such expenses shall be billed separately as provided for in\nthis subdivision. The time of each person associated with such examination or\ninvestigation shall be multiplied by the average costs of the examiners and\nspecialists at their respective grade levels assigned to such examination or\ninvestigation, plus expenses for travel outside of New York, and the resulting\namount shall be assessed separately to each such Licensee subject to such\nexamination or investigation in such amounts as the superintendent shall deem\nappropriate. Alternatively, if another entity or person is selected to perform\nan examination, investigation or review of an individual Licensee or Licensees, the expenses associated with such examination, investigation and review shall\nbe the amount of the contract for such services and such portion of the\ndepartment's administrative expenses associated with such contract as the\nsuperintendent shall deem appropriate. The resulting amount shall be assessed\nseparately to each such Licensee subject to such examination, investigation or\ninvestigation in such amounts as the superintendent shall deem appropriate. Such special assessments shall be billed within 180 days after the calendar\nquarter within which such expenses were incurred. Such amounts shall be paid\nwithin 30 days of the date of such billing. In making a determination to make a\nspecial assessment and to allocate such assessment between one or more\n\nLicensees, the superintendent shall include such factors as she or he shall\ndeem appropriate, including, but not limited to: the significance of the\nexamination to the conduct of business by a given Licensee or group of\n\nLicensees; the potential seriousness of any violations of law or regulation\nidentified by, or under review in, such examination or investigation; and the\nextent to which a Licensee attempted to cover up or failed to disclose the\nexistence of such violations.
