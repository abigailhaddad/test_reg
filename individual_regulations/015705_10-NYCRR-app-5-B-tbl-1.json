Codes R. & Regs. tit. 10, APPENDICES, app 5-B, tbl. 1 - Required Minimum Separation Distances to Protect Water Wells From Contamination\n\nState Regulations\n\nContaminant Source\n\nDistance (Feet)\n1\n\nChemical storage sites not protected from the elements (e.g., salt and sand/salt storage)\n2\n300\n\nLandfill waste disposal area, or hazardous or radiological waste disposal area\n2\n300\n\nLand surface application or subsurface injection of effluent or digested sludge from a municipal or public wastewater treatment facility\n200\n\nLand surface application or subsurface injection of septage waste\n200\n\nLand surface spreading or subsurface injection of liquid or solid manure\n3\n200\n\nStorage areas for manure piles\n4\n200\n\nBarnyard, silo, barn gutters and animal pens\n5,6\n100\n\nCesspools (i.e. pits with no septic tank pretreatment)\n200\n\nWastewater treatment absorption systems located in coarse gravel or in the direct path of drainage to a well\n200\n\nFertilizer and/or pesticide mixing and/or clean up areas\n150\n\nSeepage pit (following septic tank)\n5\n150\n\nUnderground single walled chemical or petroleum storage vessels\n150\n\nAbsorption field or bed\n5\n100\n\nContained chemical storage sites protected from the elements (e.g., salt and sand/salt storage within covered structures)\n7\n100\n\nSeptic system components (non-watertight)\n5\n100\n\nIntermittent sand filter without a watertight liner\n5\n100\n\nSanitary privy pit\n5\n100\n\nSurface wastewater recharge absorption system constructed to discharge storm water from parking lots, roadways or driveways\n5\n100\n\nCemeteries\n100\n\nSanitary privy with a watertight vault\n50\n\nSeptic tank, aerobic unit, watertight effluent line to distribution box\n50\n\nSanitary sewer or combined sewer\n50\n\nSurface water recharge absorption system with no automotive-related wastes (e.g., clear-water basin, clear-water dry well)\n50\n\nStream, lake, watercourse, drainage ditch, or wetland\n25\n\nAll known sources of contamination otherwise not shown above\n100\n\nNotes for Table 1: 1\n\nThe listed water well separation distances from contaminant sources shall be increased by 50% whenever aquifer water enters the water well at less than 50 feet below grade. If a 50% increase in separation distances can not be achieved, then the greatest possible increase in separation distance shall be provided with such additional measures as needed to prevent contamination. See also Note 6 to Table 2. 2\n\nWater wells shall not be located in a direct line of flow from these items, nor in any contaminant plume created by these items, except with such additional measures (e.g., sentinel groundwater monitoring, hydraulic containment, source water treatment) as needed to prevent contamination. 3\n\nBased upon on-site evaluations of agricultural properties done per agricultural environmental management (AEM) or comprehensive nutrient management plan (CNMP) programs by a certified nutrient management planner or soil and water conservation district (SWCD) official, water wells may be located a minimum of 100 feet from areas subject to land spreading of manure. 4\n\nWater wells may be located 100 feet from temporary (30 days or less) manure piles/staging areas that are controlled to preclude contamination of surface or groundwater or 100 feet from otherwise managed manure piles that are controlled pursuant to regulation in a manner that prevents contamination of surface or groundwater. 5\n\nWhen these contamination sources are located in coarse gravel or are located upgrade and in the direct path of drainage to a water well, the water well shall be located at least 200 feet away from the closest part of these sources. 6\n\nAnimal pen does not include small pet shelters or kennels housing 3 or fewer adult pets. 7\n\nChemical storage sites as used in this entry do not include properly maintained storage areas of chemicals used for water treatment nor areas of household quantities of commonly used domestic chemicals. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 10, APPENDICES, app 5-B, tbl. 1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
