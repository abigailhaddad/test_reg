A taxable year must be a calendar year or\na fiscal year ending during a calendar year. A taxable year shall not include\nmore than 12 calendar months except in the case of a 52-53 week period. If a\ntaxpayer does not have a taxable year for Federal income tax purposes, the\ntaxable year must be a calendar year, unless the commissioner authorizes the\nuse of a fiscal year. Any reference in article 9-A or 27 or this Subchapter to\nthe term tax year or taxable period is a reference to taxable year as defined\nby this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
