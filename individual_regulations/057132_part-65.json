Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 11, ch. III, subch. B, pt. 65\n\nThe former No-Fault regulation was repealed effective April\n5, 2002. It is therefore no longer included in the official New York Codes, Rules and Regulations. However, because there may still be claims or claim\nprocedures which remain covered by the old regulation, the New York State\n\nInsurance Department is making a copy of this regulation available for\nhistorical reference at the Insurance Department's website at http://\nwww.dfs.ny.gov/insurance/r68_old.htm. Questions as to whether specific claims\nand claims procedures are subject to the old or new No-Fault regulations are\nclarified under the FAQ section for No-Fault at http://\nwww.dfs.ny.gov/insurance/faqcs1.htm. Statutory authority: Insurance Law, §§201, 301, 2307, 2601, 5103, 5106, 5221, art. 51;Vehicle and Traffic Law, §2407\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
