  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 575.12 - Real property situated partly within and partly without the State of New York\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1415(d)\n(a) Where real property is situated partly\nwithin and partly without the boundaries of the State of New York, the\nconsideration subject to tax is such part of the total consideration as is\nattributable to the portion of such real property situated within the State of\n\nNew York or to the interest in such portion. If the consideration attributable\nto the property located in the State of New York is set forth in the contract, such amount may be used to compute the tax due. (b) If the contract does not set forth the\namount of consideration attributable to the portion of real property or\ninterest therein situated within the State of New York, the consideration must\nbe reasonably allocated between the portion of such property or interest\ntherein situated within the State of New York and the portion of such property\nor interest therein situated without the State of New York. (1)\n\nIf the grantor and the grantee enter into\na written agreement, signed by both the grantor and the grantee, which sets\nforth a reasonable allocation of consideration, that allocation of\nconsideration may be used to compute the tax due. (2)\n\nIf the grantor and the grantee do not\nenter into such an agreement, or if the allocation of consideration set forth\nin such agreement is deemed unreasonable by the department, the allocation of\nconsideration must be computed by multiplying the amount of consideration by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the fair market value of the real property\nor interest therein situated within the State of New York and the denominator\nof which is the total fair market value of all the real property or interest\ntherein being conveyed. Except in the case of a transfer or acquisition of a\ncontrolling interest where consideration means fair market value of the real\nproperty or interest therein (see section\n575.1\n[d][4]\nof this Part), the tax is computed on the allocated portion of the actual\nconsideration paid even if that amount is greater or less than the fair market\nvalue as determined by appraisal. Example 1: A conveys to B real property which is situated partly\nwithin New York State and partly within Vermont. The consideration attributable\nto the portion of the property situated within New York State was not specified\nin the contract of sale or in a written agreement signed by both A and B. B\npays A $150,000 consideration for the property. An appraisal of the property, made just prior to the sale, indicates that the total fair market value of the\nproperty is $150,000 and that the fair market value of the portion of the\nproperty situated within New York State is $120,000. The amount of\nconsideration used to commute the tax is $120,000. Example 2: Assume the same facts as example 1 except that the\nappraisal indicates that the total fair market value of the property is\n$200,000 and the fair market value of the portion of the property situated\nwithin New York State is $160,000. The amount of consideration used to compute\nthe tax is determined by multiplying the amount of consideration paid by B\n($150,000) by 80 percent. Eighty percent equals the fair market value of the\nproperty situated within New York State ($160,000) divided by the total fair\nmarket value of the property ($200,000). The amount of consideration used to\ncompute the tax is $120,000. Example 3: Corporation A owns real property which is situated partly\nwithin New York State and partly within Vermont. This is the only asset of\ncorporation A. One hundred percent of the stock of corporation A is sold to\ncorporation B for $300,000. Since a controlling interest in corporation A was\ntransferred to corporation B, there was a taxable conveyance of the real\nproperty owned by corporation A to corporation B. An appraisal of the real\nproperty indicates that the total fair market value of the property is $250,000\nand that the fair market value of the property situated within New York State\nis $200,000. The amount of consideration used to compute the tax is $200,000. The appraised fair market value is used rather than an allocated portion of the\namount paid for the stock. (c) Where the methods provided under this\nsection do not allocate the consideration in a fair and equitable manner, the\ndepartment may require a grantor and grantee to allocate the consideration\nunder such method as it prescribes, as long as the prescribed method results in\na fair and equitable allocation.
