  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 826.8 - Applications for special permission\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Emergency or merit to be shown. The Transportation Law authorizes the\ncommissioner, in his discretion and for good cause shown, to permit changes in\ntariff publications on less than statutory notice, and also to permit departure\nfrom the commissioner's rules. The commissioner will exercise this authority\nonly in cases where actual emergency or real merit are shown. Desire to meet\nthe rates of a competing carrier that has given statutory notice of change in\nrates will not of itself be regarded as good cause for permitting changes in\nrates or other provisions on less than statutory notice. Clerical or\ntypographical errors in tariffs may constitute good cause for the exercise of\nthis authority, but every application based thereon must plainly specify the\nerrors or omissions together with a full statement of the attending\ncircumstances and must be presented with reasonable promptness after issuance\nof the defective tariff, supplement, or revised page. (b) Request to depart from formal order. When\na formal order of the commissioner requires a publication to be made effective\non a stated number of days' notice, a request or special permission application\naddressed to the commissioner for authority to establish on less notice will\nnot be granted. In any such instance a petition for modification of the formal\norder must be filed. (c) Carrier or\nagent must file. Applications for permission to establish or change rates or\nother provisions on less than statutory notice, or for waiver of the provisions\nof this Part, must be made by the carrier or agent that holds authority to file\nthe proposed publication. If the application requests permission to make\nchanges in joint tariffs, it must state that it is filed for and on behalf of\nall carriers parties to the proposed change. (d) Form of application.
