  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 201.6 - Reconsideration of suspension in excess of two years\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In the event a visitor or inmate's\nvisiting privileges have been suspended for a term over two years or\nindefinitely suspended, such person may request a reconsideration at any time\nafter it has been in effect for one year, and on an annual basis thereafter, by\nwriting to the superintendent of the facility housing the inmate to be\nvisited. (b) The superintendent\nshall evaluate such a request to determine if any factors exist that warrant a\nmodification so as to permit visitation to resume at a specific time in the\nfuture. The criteria to be considered are: (1)\nthe inmate's institutional\nrecord; (2)\nshowing of special\ncircumstances (e.g., age of visitor or inmate, serious illness, etc.); (3)\nlength of inmate's\nunserved sentence; and\n(4)\npast\nhistory of violations; and\n(5)\nother good cause factors. (c) The superintendent shall advise the\ninmate and visitor of the results of his or her review by written decision, including the reasons therefor. (d) Appeal of denial of request for reconsideration. (1)\nA visitor or inmate may appeal the denial\nof a request for reconsideration, in writing, to the commissioner within 60\ndays if: (i) such person's visiting privileges\nhave been indefinitely suspended or suspended for a term over two\nyears; (ii)\nthe indefinite\nsuspension or term of suspension has remained in effect for three years; and\n(iii)\nsuch person's request for\nreconsideration during the third year under subdivision (a) of this section has\nbeen denied by the superintendent. (2)\n\nIf the indefinite suspension or term of\nsuspension of visiting privileges remains in effect, such person may appeal a\nsubsequent denial every three years thereafter. (3)\n\nNothing in this subdivision shall be\nconstrued to preclude such person from making an annual request for\nreconsideration to the superintendent of the correctional facility then housing\nthe inmate to be visited. (4)\n\nNo\nappeal of a denial of a request for reconsideration may be taken if the\nsuperintendent has modified the indefinite suspension or term of suspension to\npermit visitation, including non-contact visitation.
