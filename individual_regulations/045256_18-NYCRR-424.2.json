Tit. 18 § 424.2 - Registration requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every person who applies to adopt a\nhandicapped or hard-to-place child shall have his/her name, address and\nadditional pertinent information contained in a departmentally approved\napplication form entered into the adoptive parent registry at the time that the\nsigned application form is submitted to the registering agency. (1)\n\nThe information on the applicant shall be\nentered directly by a registering agency, having terminal access to the\ncomputer system operated by the department, at the time that a signed\napplication is submitted. (2)\n\nRegistering agencies without terminal access to the computer system operated by\nthe department shall immediately send a copy of the adoption application to the\ndepartment, which will enter the necessary information into the registry. The\nnecessary information derived from the adoption application may alternatively\nbe entered into the registry at a social services district, or another\nvoluntary agency with terminal access to the computer system operated by the\ndepartment, when written formal arrangements have been agreed upon to\nfacilitate such data input. (3)\n\nRegistering agencies which do not have terminal access to the computer system\noperated by the department shall not be charged any fees by a social services\ndistrict or another voluntary agency for entering information into the adoption\ninformation registry through such district's or agency's computer\nsystem. (b) Persons\napplying to adopt a handicapped or hard-to-place child shall be informed by the\nregistering agency of the existence and purpose of the registry, and they shall\nbe informed that their names and the characteristics of the children which they\nwish to adopt will be made available on request to all adoption agencies in the\n\nState. (c) No person who applies to\nadopt a handicapped or hard-to-place child may be accepted for a home study, in\naccordance with the provisions of section\n421.13\nof this Title, unless such\napplicant is registered with the registry, except when such person is a foster\nparent and the person is applying only to adopt the foster child or foster\nchildren residing in the foster parent's home.
