  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 519.19 - Witnesses\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Witnesses will\ntestify under oath or affirmation and will be subject to\ncross-examination. (b) All\nwitnesses will be sworn by the hearing officer and present testimony under\ndirect and cross-examination in view of the hearing officer in order that\nhis/her demeanor may be observed by the hearing officer. (c) All testimony will be given in response\nto questions posed directly to the witness by either party or his/her\nrepresentative on direct or cross-examination, or by the hearing officer where\nnecessary to fully explore the facts of the case. Hypothetical questions need\nnot be used, and expert witnesses may testify directly as to their opinions and\nreasons without specifying the data upon which they are based or by reference\nto the department's determination. However, upon cross-examination, experts may\nbe required to specify the data and other criteria supporting their\nopinions. (d) Undercover\ninvestigators employed by the department may testify behind a screening device\nor otherwise in order to block the view of the appellant or the witness as\nhe/she testifies and enters and leaves the hearing room. Such a procedure, which to the hearing officer is appropriate under the circumstances, may be\nemployed only when the department determines and states for the record that the\nsafety of the witness may be in jeopardy by his/her unscreened testimony, or\nthat his/her usefulness as an undercover operator may be compromised by his/her\nunscreened testimony, or that his/her usefulness as an undercover operator may\nbe compromised by his/her being observed by the appellant. (e) Affidavits or transcripts of prior\ntestimony may be introduced as evidence where the witness is without the State\nor otherwise unavailable, however, such testimony may not be accepted as sole\nproof of a fact unless otherwise qualified under an exception to the hearsay\nrules.
