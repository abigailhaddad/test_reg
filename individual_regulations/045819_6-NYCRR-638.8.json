(h) Start-up and checkout. Start-up and checkout must comprise the checks and tests to determine that all components, equipment, subsystems, systems, and interfaces between systems operate in accordance with construction documents. In this context, operate includes all modes and sequences of control operation, interlocks and conditional control responses, and specified responses to abnormal or emergency conditions. (1)\n\nThe results of the start-up and checkout must be documented and must be performed according to: (i) the manufacturer's written instructions for the systems and equipment being commissioned; and\n(ii)\nthe construction documents. (2)\nA certificate of readiness must be prepared by the contractor and delivered to the commissioning authority stating that start-up and checkout have been successfully completed and that all equipment, systems, and controls are complete and ready for functional performance testing. (i) The commissioning authority must verify that initial start-up and checkout were successfully completed. (ii)\n\nThe commissioning authority must verify that every point of the control system was checked and that every control point is commanding, reporting and controlling as specified in the construction documents. Verification must include a minimum sample of each type of control point. In addition, the controls that are verified must be within a minimum sample of each type of component, equipment, subsystem and system where the sensor type is installed. If any control point in the minimum sample is not commanding, reporting and controlling as specified in the construction documents, then an additional minimum sample of each type of control found not to be performing must be checked, until all control points in a minimum sample are found to be performing as specified. (iii)\n\nThe commissioning authority must verify that all sensors have been calibrated so that the value reported in the control system represents the actual local value. Verification must include re-calibrating a minimum sample of each type of sensor. In addition, the sensors that are re-calibrated must be within a minimum sample of each type of component, equipment, subsystem and system where the sensor type is installed. If any sensor in the minimum sample is out of calibration, then an additional minimum sample of each type of sensor found to be out of calibration must be re-calibrated, until all sensors in a minimum sample are found to be in calibration. (iv)\n\nThe commissioning authority must verify that all actuators have been adjusted to fully close and open dampers and valves, and also must verify by visual observation that the reported values in the control system are correct. Verification must include checking the operation of a minimum sample of each type of actuator, valve, and damper. In addition, the actuator, valve, and damper must be within a minimum sample of each type of component, equipment, subsystem and system where the type of actuator, valve, and damper is installed. If any actuator, valve, or damper in the minimum sample does not operate as required in the construction documents, then an additional minimum sample of each type of actuator, valve, or damper found not to be operating as required must be verified until all actuators, valves, or dampers in a minimum sample are found to be to be operating as required. (v) The commissioning authority must verify the TAB by re-measuring a minimum sample of values reported for each type of component, equipment, subsystem, or system in the TAB reports. In addition, the values that are re-measured must be within a minimum sample of each type of subsystem and each type of system. If any re-measured value in the minimum sample deviates from the values in the TAB report or from the requirements in the construction documents by more than 10 percent, then an additional minimum sample must be re-measured for each type of component, equipment, subsystem or system for which there is a deviation, until all re-measured values in a minimum sample are within 10 percent of the values in the TAB report or of the requirements in the construction documents. (vi)\n\nThe commissioning authority must: (a) check that chimneys, chimney connectors and stacks are free of cracks, blockages and leaks; (b) ensure that proper combustion air is provided to the HVAC equipment; (c) ensure that all appliances are installed in accordance with applicable fire safety and local building codes; and\n(d) witness the testing of air-tightness of smoking areas (if any), and document that all air leaks, if any, were sealed. (i) Functional performance testing. (1)\n\nWritten, repeatable test procedures must be prepared specifically for the project and must be used to functionally test equipment, components, subsystems, systems, and sequences and modes of operation. Test procedures must be documented to describe the individual test procedure, the expected system response, and acceptance criteria for each procedure. (2)\n\nTesting documentation must identify the actual system response and must provide any pertinent observations or discussion. (3)\n\nAfter initial check-out has been verified and approved by the commissioning authority, then the following must be tested: (i) Each sequence in the sequence of operations must be tested. Additionally, other significant modes, sequences and control strategies not mentioned in the written sequences must be tested. The testing must include the following: (a) start-up; (b) shutdown; (c) unoccupied and manual modes; (d) modulation up and down the unit's range of capacity, if applicable; (e) staging, if applicable; (f) power failure/power down; (g) alarms; (h) backup upon failure; and\n(i) interlocks with other equipment. (ii)\n\nThe functional performance of each type of component, equipment, subsystem, and system must be tested using a minimum sample for each type of component, equipment, subsystem and system. If any component, equipment, subsystem or system in the minimum sample is found not to operate as required in the construction documents, then an additional minimum sample of each type found not to be operating as required must be tested until all units in a minimum sample are found to be operating as required. (iii)\n\nEquipment must be tested to demonstrate performance under near-design conditions. To this end, tests on respective HVAC equipment and systems must be executed during both the heating and cooling season. However, overriding of control values to simulate cooling conditions during the heating season, and heating conditions during the cooling season is allowed where it would not affect the demonstrated performance required in the construction documents for the component, equipment, subsystem, system, or mode or sequence of operation being tested. Where the conditions listed above in this paragraph are not met, seasonally deferred testing must be undertaken. (iv)\n\nThe central plant (heating and cooling) must have its efficiency recorded for later reference by operations staff. (v) Functional performance testing must be done using manual methods, or control system trend logs and read-outs, or stand-alone data loggers, as deemed appropriate by the commissioning authority. (j) Training. (1)\n\nThe commissioning authority must assemble written verification that training of operations and maintenance personnel was conducted for all commissioned features and systems. (2)\n\nThe training program for operations and maintenance personnel must include instructional and demonstration portions. (3)\n\nThe owner must identify for the purpose of training the specific in-house personnel or contracted organization that will be responsible for the operations and maintenance for the building. Training must be performed within six months of the date that either the initial or subsequent statement of commissioning certification, as appropriate as determined by the commissioning authority, has been executed. Qualified personnel must perform training for a sufficient duration of time to ensure that facility staff for the building has all the information they need to properly operate, maintain and replace each feature or system that is commissioned. (4)\n\nIn addition, if operations and maintenance personnel change during the period that the tax credit provided for in this part is taken, the replacement personnel must receive the training required by these regulations. Written verification that this training was conducted must be maintained.
