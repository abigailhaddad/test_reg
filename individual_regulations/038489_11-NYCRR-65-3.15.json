  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 65-3.15 - Computation of basic economic loss\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen claims aggregate to more than $50,000, payments for basic economic loss shall be made to the applicant and/or an assignee in the order in which each service was rendered or each expense was incurred, provided claims therefor were made to the insurer prior to the exhaustion of the $50,000. If the insurer pays the $50,000 before receiving claims for services rendered prior in time to those which were paid, the insurer will not be liable to pay such late claims. If the insurer receives claims of a number of providers of services, at the same time, the payments shall be made in the order of rendition of services. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n65-3.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
