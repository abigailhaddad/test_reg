  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 2.46 - High-temperature-short-time, (htst), continuous-flow pasteurization-item 16p(b)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Indicating\nthermometers and recorder/controller instruments. All indicating thermometers\nand recorder/controller instruments and devices used in connection with the\nhigh-temperature-short-time, continuous-flow pasteurization of milk or milk\nproducts shall comply with the applicable specifications set forth in Appendix\n3 of this Title. (b) Automatic milk\ncontroller. Each high-temperature-short-time, continuous-flow pasteurization\nsystem shall be equipped with an automatic milk flow control of the diversion\ntype, which complies with the following definition, specifications and\nperformance requirements: (1)\n\nAutomatic\nmilk-flow controls. The term automatic milk-flow controls shall mean those\nsafety devices which control the flow of milk in relation to the temperature of\nthe milk, or heating medium and/or pressure, vacuum or other auxiliary\nequipment. Milk-flow controls shall not be considered as part of the\ntemperature control equipment. Milk-flow controls shall be of the\nflow-diversion type which automatically cause the diversion of the milk in\nresponse to a sublegal pasteurization temperature. At sublegal temperatures, flow-diversion devices return the milk to the raw milk side of the heating\nsystem continuously until legal pasteurization temperatures are obtained; at\nwhich time, the device restores forward flow through the pasteurizer. (2)\n\nFlow-diversion devices. All\nflow-diversion devices used in continuous pasteurizers shall comply with the\nfollowing or equally satisfactory specifications: (i) Forward flow of subtemperature milk, due\nto the omission or looseness of the connecting clip, shall be prevented by\nmaking the valve and its actuating mechanism integral; or, where there is a\nconnecting device, by making it impossible to assemble the valve and its\nactuating mechanism, except in such manner that it will function properly; or, where there is a connecting device which may be omitted or shaken loose by\nproviding for pushing, instead of pulling, the valve to the diverted position; or by providing that the pump will shut down when the milk is below the\npasteurization temperature and the valve is not in the fully diverted position; or by any other equally satisfactory means. (ii)\n\nWhen a packing gland is used to prevent\nleakage around the actuating stem, it shall be impossible to tighten the stem\npacking nut to such an extent as to prevent the valve from assuming the fully\ndiverted position. (iii)\nA leak\nescape shall be installed on the forward-flow side of the valve seat. However, when back pressure is exerted on the forward-flow side of the valve seat, while\nthe milk-flow is being diverted, the leak escape should lie between two valve\nseats, or between two portions of the same seat, one upstream and the other\ndownstream from the leak escape. The leak escape shall be designed and\ninstalled to discharge all leakage to the outside, or to the constant-level\ntank through a line separate from the diversion line, provided that, when\nleakage is discharged to the constant-level tank, a sight glass shall be\ninstalled in the leak escape line to provide a visual means of leak\ndetection. (iv)\n\nThe closure of the\nforward-flow seat shall be sufficiently tight so that leakage past it will not\nexceed the capacity of the leak escape device, as evidenced when the\nforward-flow line is disconnected; and in order that proper seating may not be\ndisturbed, the length of the connecting rod shall not be adjustable by the\nuser. (v) The flow-diversion device\nshall be so designed and installed that failure of the primary motivating power\nshall automatically divert the flow of milk. (vi)\n\nThe flow-diversion device shall be\nlocated downstream from the holder. The flow-control sensor shall be located in\nthe milk line not more than 18 inches upstream from the flow-control\ndevice. (vii)\n\nIn the case of\nhigher-heat-shorter-time (HHST) pasteurizing systems utilizing the temperatures\nof 191° F (89° C) and above and holding times of one second and less, the\nflow-diversion device may be located downstream from the regenerator and/or\ncooler sections; provided that, when the flow-diversion device is located\ndownstream from the regenerator and/or cooler section, the flow-diversion\ndevice shall be automatically prevented from assuming the forward-flow position\nuntil all product-contact surfaces between the holding tube and flow-diversion\ndevice have been held at or above the required pasteurization temperature\ncontinuously and simultaneously for at least the required pasteurization time\nas set forth in section\n2.44\nof this Part. (viii)\n\nThe pipeline from the diversion port\nof the flow-diversion device shall be self-draining, and shall be free of\nrestrictions or valves, unless such restrictions or valves are so designed that\nstoppage of the diversion line cannot occur. (ix)\n\nWhen it is used, the pipeline from the\nleak detector port of the flow-diversion device shall be self-draining, and\nshall be free of restrictions or valves, unless such restrictions or valves are\nso designed that stoppage of the leak detector line cannot occur. (3)\n\nMilk-flow controller\ninstrumentation. The following requirements shall be met with respect to the\ninstrumentation of the milk-flow controller: (i) The thermal limit controller shall be set\nand sealed so that forward flow of product cannot start unless the temperature\nat the controller sensor is above the required pasteurization temperature as\ndefined in section\n2.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart for the milk or milk product and the process used, nor continue during\ndescending temperatures when the temperature is below the required\npasteurization temperature. The seal shall be applied by the commissioner after\ntesting, and shall not be removed without immediately notifying the\ncommissioner. The system shall be so designed that no milk can be bypassed\naround the controller sensor which shall not be removed from its proper\nposition during the pasteurization process. The cut-in and cut-out milk\ntemperatures, as shown by the indicating thermometer, shall be determined at\nthe beginning of each day's operation and entered upon the recorder chart daily\nby the plant operator. (ii)\n\nIn the\ncase of HHST pasteurization systems, utilizing the temperatures of 191° F (89°\nC) and above, the holding times of one second or less, with the flow-diversion\ndevice located downstream from the regenerator and/or cooler section, additional temperature controllers and timers shall be interwired with the\nthermal limit controller, and the control system shall be set and sealed so\nthat forward flow of product cannot start until all product-contact surfaces\nbetween the holding tube and flow-diversion device have been held at or above\nthe required pasteurization temperature, continuously and simultaneously for at\nleast the required pasteurization time as set forth in section\n2.44\nof this Part. The control\nsystem shall also be set and sealed so that forward flow cannot continue when\nthe temperature of the product in the holding tube is below the required\npasteurization temperature. The seal shall be applied by the commissioner after\ntest, and shall not be removed without immediately notifying the commissioner. The system shall be so designed that no product can be bypassed around the\ncontrol sensors, which shall not be removed from their proper position during\nthe pasteurization process. For these HHST systems, daily measurement by the\noperator of the cut-in and cut-out temperatures is not required. (iii)\n\nManual switches for the control of\npumps, homogenizers or other devices which produce flow through the holder, shall be wired so that the circuit is completed only when the milk is above the\nrequired pasteurization temperature as set forth in section\n2.44\nof this Part for the milk or\nmilk product and the process used, or when the diversion device is in the fully\ndiverted position. (4)\n\nHolding tube. (i) Holders shall be designed\nto provide for the holding of every particle of milk or milk product for at\nleast the time required in section\n2.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart for the milk or milk product and the process used. (ii)\n\nThe holder shall be so designed that the\nsimultaneous temperature difference between the hottest and coldest milk in any\ncross-section of flow at any time during the holding period will not be greater\nthan one degree Fahrenheit (one-half degree Celsius). This requirement may be\nassumed to have been satisfied without test in tubular holders of seven inches\nor smaller diameter which are free of any fittings through which the milk may\nnot be thoroughly swept. (iii)\n\nNo\ndevice shall be permitted for short-circuiting a portion of the holder to\ncompensate for changes in rate of milk flow. Holding tubes shall be installed\nso that sections of pipe cannot be left out, resulting in a shortened holding\ntime. (iv)\n\nThe holding tube shall\nbe arranged to have a continuously upward slope in the direction of flow of not\nless than 0.25 inch per foot. (v) Supports for tubes shall be provided to maintain all parts of holding tubes in\na fixed position, free from any lateral or vertical movement. (vi)\n\nThe holder shall be so designed that no\nportion between the inlet and the flow-control temperature sensor is\nheated. (vii)\n\nThe holding time for\nthe HHST processes must be determined from the pumping rate rather than by the\nsalt conductivity test, because of the short holding tube. The holding tube\nlength must be such that the fastest flowing particle of any product will not\ntraverse the holding tube in less than the required holding time. Since laminar\nflow (the fastest flowing particle travels twice as fast as the average flowing\nparticle) can occur in the holding tube during pasteurization of high-viscosity\nproducts, holding tube lengths are calculated as twice the length required to\nhold the average flow for the time standard. (viii)\n\nWith the steam injection processes, the holding time is reduced because the product volume increases as the steam\ncondenses to water during heating in the injector. This surplus water is\nevaporated as the pasteurized product is cooled in the vacuum chamber. For\nexample, with a 120° F (66° C) increase by steam injection, which is probably\nthe maximum temperature rise that will be used, a volume increase of 12 percent\nwill occur in the holding tube. The measurement of the average flow rate at the\ndischarge of the pasteurizer does no reflect this volume increase in the\nholding tube. However, this volume increase, i.e., holding time decrease, must\nbe considered in the calculations. (ix)\n\nWith the steam injection process a\npressure limit indicator is needed in the holding tube to keep the heated\nproduct in the liquid phase. The instrument must have a pressure switch so that\nthe flow-diversion device will move to the divert position if the product\npressure falls below a prescribed value. For operating temperatures between\n191° F (89° C) and 212° F (100° C), the pressure switch must be set at 10\npounds per square inch (psi). For units which have operating temperatures above\n212° F (100° C), the pressure switch must be set at a pressure 10 psi above the\nboiling pressure of the product at its maximum temperature in the holding\ntube. (x) With the steam injection\nprocess, a differential pressure limit indicator across the injector is needed\nto ensure adequate isolation of the injection chamber. The instrument must have\na differential pressure switch so that the flow-diversion device will move to\nthe divert position if the pressure drop across the injector falls below 10\npsi. (5)\n\nIndicating and\nrecording thermometers. (i) An indicating\nthermometer shall be located as near a practicable to the temperature sensor of\nthe recorder/controller, but may be located a short distance upstream from the\nlatter where milk between the two thermometers does not differ significantly in\ntemperature. (ii)\n\nThe temperature\nshown by the recorder/controller shall be checked daily by the plant operator\nagainst the temperature shown by the indicating thermometer. Readings shall be\nrecorded on the chart. The recorder/controller shall be adjusted to read no\nhigher than the indicating thermometer. (iii)\n\nThe recorder/controller charts shall\ncomply with the applicable provisions of section\n2.48\nof this Part (Item\n16p[D]). (6)\n\nFlow-promoting devices. (i) The pump, or\npumps, and other equipment which may produce flow through the holder shall be\nlocated upstream from the holder, provided that pumps and other flow-promoting\ndevices may be located downstream from the holder if means are provided to\neliminate negative pressure between the holder and the inlet to such equipment. When vacuum equipment is located downstream from the holder, an effective\nvacuum breaker, plus an automatic means of preventing a negative pressure in\nthe line between the flow-diversion device and the vacuum chamber, shall be\nacceptable. (ii)\n\nThe speed of pumps\nor other flow-promoting devices governing the rate of flow through the holder\nshall be so controlled as to insure the holding of every particle of milk for\nat least the time required, as set forth in section\n2.44\nof this Part, for the milk or\nmilk product and the process used. In all cases, the motor shall be connected\nto the metering pump by means of a common drive shaft, or by means of gears, pulleys or a variable-speed drive, with the gear box, the pulley box, or the\nsetting of the variable speed protected in such a manner that the holding time\ncannot be shortened without detection by the commissioner. This shall be\naccomplished by the application of a suitable seal(s) after tests by the\ncommissioner, and such seal shall not be broken without immediately notifying\nthe commissioner. The provision shall apply to all homogenizers used as timing\npumps. Variable speed drives used in connection with the metering pump shall be\nso constructed that wearing or stretching of the belt results in a slowdown, rather than a speedup, of the pump. The metering or timing pump shall be of the\npositive displacement type. (iii)\n\nThe holding time shall be taken to mean the flow time of the fastest particle\nof milk, at or above the required pasteurization temperature, as set forth in\nsection\n2.44\nof this Part, for the milk or\nmilk product and the process used, throughout the holder section; i.e., that\nportion of the system that is outside of the influence of the heating medium, and slopes continuously upward in the downstream direction, and is located\nupstream from the flow-diversion device. Tests for holding time shall be made\nwhen all equipment and devices are operated and adjusted to provide for maximum\nflow. When a homogenizer is located upstream from the holder, the holding time\nshall be determined with the homogenizer in operation with no pressure on the\nhomogenizer valves. Where bypass lines are provided, either upstream or\ndownstream from the metering pump, the holding time shall be tested with both\nthe regular and bypass line open, unless the bypass valve is so designed that\nboth lines cannot be open at the same time. The holding time shall be tested\nduring both forward and diverted flow. If necessary to lengthen the holding\ntime during diverted flow, an identifiable restriction may be placed in the\nvertical portion of the diversion pipeline. When vacuum equipment is located\ndownstream from the holder, the holding time shall be tested with the metering\npump operating at maximum flow, and the vacuum equipment adjusted to provide\nfor the maximum vacuum. The holding time shall be tested in both forward and\ndiverted flow by the regulatory agency initially, quarterly thereafter, after\nany alteration or replacement that may effect the holding time, and whenever\nthe seal of the speed setting has been broken. (7)\n\nHeating by direct addition of steam. Steam injection is an inherently unstable process; accordingly, when steam is\ninjected into a fluid, condensation of the steam may not be completed inside\nthe injector unless the proper design criteria are used. Lack of complete\ncondensation inside the injector would cause temperature variations in the\nholding tube that could lead to some product particles being processed below\npasteurization temperature. When culinary steam is introduced directly into\nmilk or milk products, as the means of terminal heating to achieve\npasteurization temperature, the steam injector shall be designed, installed and\noperated to comply with the following or equally satisfactory specifications: (i) The product and steam flows must be\nisolated from pressure fluctuations inside the injection chamber. One method of\nisolation is to insert supplementary orifices on the product inlet and the\nheated product outlet of each injector. The two supplementary orifices must be\nsized for at least a 10 psi product pressure drop across the injector during a\nsimulation of normal operations. Excessive vibrations, pressure fluctuations or\nerratic noise levels indicate an unstable steam injection system and a need to\ncheck the isolation of the injection chamber. (ii)\n\nThe product pressure in the holding tube\nmust be of sufficient magnitude to condense the steam and keep the heated\nproduct in the liquid phase. If this pressure is too low, the resultant\nvaporization in the holding tube will substantially reduce residence times. A\nminimum product pressure in the holding tube of 10 psi for operating\ntemperatures from 191° F (89° C) through 212° F (100° C) is satisfactory. For\nunits which have operating temperatures above 212° F (100° C), the pressure of\nthe product in the holding tube must be at least 10 psi above the boiling\npressure of the product at its maximum temperature in the holding\ntube. (iii)\n\nThe process should be\nas free as possible of noncondensable gases that may evolve from the product or\nbe carried in the steam supply. Any two-phase flow caused by the noncondensable\ngases would displace the product in the holding tube, resulting in reduced\nresidence times. In addition, these gases in the steam supply may also markedly\nalter the condensation mechanism at the point of injection. Accordingly, the\nsteam boiler shall be supplied with a deaerator. The deaerator will aid in\nkeeping the product in the holding tube as free as possible of noncondensable\ngases. (8)\n\nPrevention of\nproduct adulteration with added water. (i) When culinary steam is introduced directly into the milk or milk product\ndownstream from the flow-diversion device, means shall be provided to preclude\nthe addition of steam to the product, unless the flow-diversion device is in\nthe forward-flow position. This provision may be satisfied by the use of an\nautomatic steam control valve with temperature sensor located downstream from\nthe steam inlet, or by the use of an automatic solenoid valve installed in the\nsteam line and so wired through the flow-diversion device controls that steam\ncannot flow unless the flow-diversion device is in the forward-flow\nposition. (ii)\n\nWhen culinary steam\nis introduced directly into the milk or milk product, automatic means shall be\nprovided to maintain a proper temperature differential between incoming and\noutgoing milk to preclude dilution with water. (iii)\n\nWhere a water feed line is connected to\na vacuum condenser and the vacuum condenser is not separated from the vacuum\nchamber by a physical barrier, means shall be provided to preclude the backup\nand overflow of water from the vacuum condenser to the vacuum chamber. This\nprovision may be satisfied by the use of a safety shutoff valve, located on the\nwater feed line to the vacuum condenser, automatically actuated by a control\nwhich will shut off the inflowing water, if for example, the condensate pump\nstops and the water level rises above a predetermined point in the vacuum\ncondenser. This valve may be actuated by water, air or electricity, and shall\nbe so designed that failure of the primary motivating power will automatically\nstop the flow of water into the vacuum condenser.
