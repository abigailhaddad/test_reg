Example 1: Sales tax computation when excise tax is a tax on the\nmanufacturer: Price of merchandise\n$1,040\n\nFederal manufacturer's excise tax\n+ 60\n\nTaxable receipt\n1,100\n\nSales tax at 7%\n+ 77\n\nTotal due\n$1,177\n(ii)\n\nAlso included in the receipts on which\nsales tax is computed are the State excise taxes imposed on consumers of\ncigarettes pursuant to article 20 of the Tax Law and the cigarette tax imposed\nby chapter 13 of title 11 of the Administrative Code of the City of New\n\nYork. (iii)\n\nExcise taxes of the\nkind described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph are included in\nthe receipts on which sales tax is computed even though such excise taxes may\nbe separately stated to the purchaser. (2)\n\nExclusions. With the exception of the taxes imposed on consumers of\ncigarettes (see subparagraph [1][ii] of this subdivision), and except as\notherwise provided by law, excise taxes that are imposed on the consumer are\nexcluded from the receipts on which sales tax is computed. Among these taxes, by way of example and not by way of limitation, are: (i) The Federal retail excise taxes imposed\npursuant to chapter\n31\nof title 26 of the U.S. Code on, for instance, special\nmotor fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas, gasoline sold or used in\nnoncommercial aviation, and heavy trucks and trailers sold at retail.

Example 2: Sales tax computation when the excise tax is not included\nin the taxable receipt: Price of merchandise (including Federal retail excise\ntax at 12%)\n$1,120\n\nLess: Federal retail excise tax at 12%\n-120\n\nTaxable receipt\n1,000\n\nSales tax at 7%\n+ 70\n\nTotal before excise tax\n1,070\n\nExcise tax (add back)\n+120\n\nTotal due\n1,190\n(c) Coupons. (1)\n\nWhere a manufacturer issues a coupon\nentitling a purchaser to a credit on the item purchased, the tax is due on the\nfull amount of the receipt. The receipt is composed of the amount paid and the\namount of the coupon credit. The coupon credit reflects a payment or\nreimbursement by another party to the vendor. Example 1: A manufacturer issues coupons entitling the holder to\ncredit allowances of 12¢ on the purchase of its products from a retailer. The\ntax is computed as follows by the retailer: Regular price\n63¢\nTax at 7% rate\n5¢\n68¢\nCredit for mfr. coupon\n12¢\nAmount due from purchaser\n56¢\n(2)\n\nWhere a store issues a coupon, entitling a purchaser to a credit on the item\npurchased, for which it is reimbursed by a manufacturer or distributor, the tax\nis due on the full amount of the receipt. The receipt is composed of the amount\npaid and the amount of the coupon credit. The coupon must indicate, by \"mfr\" or\nsome other code, that reimbursement is made. The reimbursement from the\nmanufacturer or distributor to the store may be made in any form, such as cash\nor a credit against purchases or in additional merchandise. Example 2: A store issues a coupon, labeled \"mfr\" entitling the holder\nto a credit allowance of 12¢ on the purchase of its products from a retailer. The purchaser is billed as follows by the retailer: Regular price\n63¢\nTax at 7% rate\n5¢\n68¢\nCredit for mfr. coupon\n12¢\nAmount due from purchaser\n56¢\n(3)\n\nWhere a store issues a coupon entitling a purchaser to a discounted price on\nthe item purchased, and receives no reimbursement, the tax is due from the\npurchaser on only the discounted price, which is the actual receipt. Example 3: A Store issues coupons entitling the holder to credit\nallowance of 12 cents on the purchase of its products from a retailer. The\npurchaser is billed as follows by the retailer: Regular price\n63¢\nStore coupon\n12¢\n51¢\nTax at 7 percent rate\n4¢\nAmount due from purchaser\n55¢\n(4)\n\nWhere a store issues a coupon involving manufacturer's reimbursement, but does\nnot disclose that fact to the purchaser on the coupon or in the advertisement, the vendor will collect from the purchaser only the tax due on the reduced\nprice, but will be required to pay the tax on the entire receipt-the amount of\nthe price and the reimbursement received from the manufacturer or\ndistributor. (d) Discounts. (1)\n\nDiscounts which are\ngranted by a vendor, for the purpose of encouraging prompt payment on an\naccount, known as \"early payment discounts\" are not deductible from receipts. Example 1: A vendor grants a purchaser a 2 percent discount for paying\nthe price of a $100 camera within 10 days, and expects payment of the full\nprice if paid within 30 days. The sales tax, in a 7 percent area, is $7 on the\ntaxable receipt of $100, whichever method of payment the customer\nchooses. DISCOUNT METHOD\nFULL PRICE METHOD\n$100 Price\n$100\n7\n\nTax\n7\n$107\n$107\n2\n\nDiscount\n$105 Due\n(2)\n\nDiscounts which represent a reduction in price, such as a trade discount, volume discount or cash and carry discount are deductible in computing\nreceipts. Example 2: A vendor grants a purchaser a 30 percent discount for\npurchasing 1,000 light bulbs. The taxable receipt will be the discount price. The billing in a 7 percent area, should be similar to: 1,000 Bulbs at 50¢\n$500.00\n\nLess 30%\n150.00\n$350.00\n\nTax at 7%\n24.50\n\nDue\n$374.50\n\nExample 3: A vendor grants a purchaser a 10 percent cash and carry\ndiscount. The taxable receipt will be the discounted price. The billing in a 7\npercent area should be similar to: Merchandise\n$50.00\n\nLess 10%\n5.00\n$45.00\n\nTax at 7%\n3.15\n\nDue\n$48.15\n(e) Expenses. All expenses, including telephone and telegraph and other\nservice charges, incurred by a vendor in making a sale, regardless of their\ntaxable status and regardless of whether they are billed to a customer are not\ndeductible from the receipts. Example 1: A photographer contracts with a customer to furnish\nphotographs at $50 each in addition to expenses. The customer is billed as follows: Photographs (2)\n$100\n\nModel fees\n60\n\nMeals\n10\n\nTravel\n25\n\nProps (Flowers)\n5\n\nTotal due\n$200\n\nReceipt subject to tax is $200\n\nExample 2: An appliance repairman charges $10 per hour plus expenses\nwhen on a service call. The customer is billed as follows: 3 hrs. at $10\n$30\n\nTravel\n15\n\nParts\n20\n\nMeals\n5\n\nTotal due\n$70\n\nReceipt subject to tax is $70\n(f) Trade-in. Any allowance or credit for any tangible personal property\naccepted in part payment by a vendor on the purchase of tangible personal\nproperty or services and intended for resale by such vendor shall be excluded\nwhen arriving at the receipt subject to tax. Only the net sale price of\ntangible personal property or the charge for services would be subject to\ntax. Example 1: A motor vehicle dealer allows a customer $850 for a used\nautomobile, accepted in part payment against the sale price of $3,200 for a new\nautomobile. The used automobile is for resale. The customer is billed as\nfollows: New automobile\n$3,200\n\nTrade-in\n850\n\nDue\n$2,350\n\nReceipt subject to tax is $2,350\n\nExample 2: A vendor accepts a typewriter in trade from a customer on\nthe purchase of an adding machine. The typewriter is intended for resale. The\ncustomer is billed as follows: Adding machine\n$250\n\nTrade-in\n80\n\nDue\n$170\n\nReceipt subject to tax is $170\n(g) Shipping or delivery. (1)\n\nShipping or delivery charges by a vendor to its customer for the cost of\ntransporting tangible personal property to the customer are part of the\nvendor's receipt subject to tax where the sale of the property is subject to\ntax or where taxable services were performed on the property. This is so\nregardless of whether the vendor separately states such charges in a written\ncontract or on an invoice and regardless of whether the vendor ships or\ndelivers the property itself or hires a third party to ship or deliver the\nproperty. Similarly, charges by a vendor to its customer for picking up the\ncustomer' s property upon which the vendor is to perform taxable services are\npart of the vendor' s receipt from the sale of the service subject to\ntax. (2)\nA charge by a vendor to\nits customer for the cost of transportation of the property from a supplier, manufacturer, warehouse or catalog or other distribution point to the vendor's\nplace of business is also part of the vendor's receipt from the sale of the\nproperty to the customer subject to tax, whether the charge is designated as\ntransportation, shipping, handling or in some other manner. (3)\nA charge for transporting or delivering\nproperty by a transportation or delivery company to the person or business\nrequesting that the property be transported or delivered is not a receipt\nsubject to tax, since transportation and delivery are not themselves services\nsubject to tax. Example 1: A vendor charges his or her customer $15 for transportation\nof the customer's purchases. The purchases are transported from the vendor's\nplace of business to the customer's home in New York. The customer is billed as\nfollows: Purchases\n$100.00\n\nTransportation charges\n15.00\n\nTotal\n$115.00\n\nThe vendor's entire receipt of $115 is subject to tax, since it is for the sale of taxable property, including the vendor's separately\nstated portion of the receipt labelled \"transportation.\"\nExample 2: A vendor charges his or her customer $15 for shipping of\nthe customer's purchases. The purchases are drop-shipped from the manufacturer\nto the purchaser in New York. The customer is billed as follows: Purchases\n$100.00\n\nShipping\n15.00\n\nTotal\n$115.00\n\nThe entire $115 is subject to tax, for the same reason as\nin Example 1. Example 3: A contractor purchases lumber from a broker. The contract\nprovides that the lumber will be drop-shipped from a producer' s mill in\n\nWashington to the job site in New York and prepaid transportation charges will\nbe included. The contractor is billed as follows: 1000 board feet of 2 × 4's\n$500\n(including $100 prepaid freight)\n\nThe entire $500 is subject to tax. Example 4: A building contractor purchases six cubic yards of\nready-mix concrete. The producer charges $56 per cubic yard for the concrete\nand $7.50 per cubic yard for delivery. The building contractor is billed as\nfollows: 6 cubic yards mix @ $56\n$336\n$7.50 delivery fee per cubic yard\n45\n\nTotal\n$381\n\nThe entire $381 is subject to tax. Example 5: X Company operates a retail sales business and its mail\norder division sells merchandise at retail by mail order. X Company ships its\nmerchandise to its customers through a parcel delivery service or by United\n\nStates mail. Charges to X Company by the delivery service are determined by the\ndistance the package is shipped and the weight and size of the package. The\namount that X Company charges its customer for postage and handling might be\nmore or less than the amount that the delivery service charges X Company for\nshipping the merchandise to X Company's customer. X Company separately states a\ncharge for postage and handling to its customer when it bills the customer for\nthe merchandise delivered. This charge by X Company to its customer for postage\nand handling is part of X Company's receipt from the sale of the merchandise\nand is subject to sales tax, regardless of its being separately stated on the\ninvoice. Example 6: A delivery service company makes available to the general\npublic an area in its warehouse where customers may drop off packages to be\ndelivered to persons or businesses in the United States for a fee. The customer\ndropping off a package for delivery is required to complete an invoice stating\nhis or her name and address, the name and address where such package is to be\ndelivered, and the contents and value of the package. The delivery service\ncompany charges a fee to the customer for delivering the package. This fee is\nbased on the weight and value of the package and the distance it is to be\ndelivered. The company's charge to the customer for shipping the package is not\nsubject to sales tax. This is purely a transportation service, which is not a\ntaxable service. Example 7: The ABC Moving Company transports household goods for\nhomeowners from one place to another, as well as business property owned by\nbusinesses moving from one place to another. ABC's charges to its household or\nbusiness customers to move their property are not subject to tax, since\ntransportation of goods, as such, is not itself a taxable service. Example 8: A record store sells records, cassettes and compact discs\nat retail through mail-order promotions. The mail-order customer is required to\ncomplete an order form. The order form has spaces for items to be ordered, a\npreprinted charge for postage and handling of $2.95, plus spaces for sales tax\nand the total. The charge for the postage and handling is subject to tax as it\nis part of the record store's receipt for the retail sale of tangible personal\nproperty. (h) Interest. (1)\n\nAny charge for\ncredit imposed by a vendor and paid by a purchaser in addition to the purchase\nprice under a designation such as interest, service charge or finance charge is\nnot deemed to be part of the sale price of tangible personal property or charge\nfor services rendered. Such charges are consideration for the extension of\ncredit and shall not be included in the receipt subject to sales tax. Example 1: A vendor sells furniture for $1,000 and charges 11/2\npercent interest per month on the outstanding balance. Only the $1,000 is a\nreceipt subject to tax. (2)\n\nThe imposition of charges by a credit card company, deducted from a\nparticipating vendor's account, are charges for financial services rendered. Such charges have no bearing on the computation of receipts subject to tax. Example 2: A vendor sells furniture for $1,000. The purchaser uses a\nbank credit card. The bank, when remitting to the vendor, deducts a five\npercent service charge ($50). The vendor is required to charge and remit tax on\n$1,000. (3)\n\nInterest paid by\na lessor on the purchase of tangible personal property intended to be leased to\na customer is an expenditure of the lessor and is to be included in the receipt\nsubject to tax. (See subdivision [e] of this section.)\n\nExample 3: A lessor, on credit, purchases equipment for a lessee. The\nagreement provides that the lessee is to pay $100 per month for equipment\nrented and $7 per month to reimburse the lessor for interest paid. The tax is\nto be collected on $107. (i) Demurrage. (1)\nA charge by a vendor to a customer for\nthe retention of tangible personal property beyond a stipulated time is deemed\nto be a taxable receipt from the rental or lease of tangible personal property\nretained. The designation of such charge as a penalty, late fee or demurrage in\nno way affects its taxable status. (2)\nA charge by a vendor to a customer for a\ndelay by the customer in removing tangible personal property from the vendor's\npremises is a charge for the storage of such tangible personal property. (See\nsection\n527.6\nof this Subchapter.)\n(3)\nA charge\nto a shipper or consignee for the retention of a railroad car, trailer, semitrailer, vessel or marine-cargo container is considered part of the\ntransportation charge and not subject to the sales or compensating use tax, although such charge may be designated as demurrage. (See subdivision [g] of\nthis section.)\n(j) Deposits. A charge made by a vendor to a customer as a deposit on\ntangible personal property rented, leased or loaned is not deemed to be a\ntaxable receipt, but is collateral security for return of the property. Upon\nthe return of the rented, leased or borrowed tangible personal property, any\namount not refunded by the vendor constitutes a taxable\nreceipt. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
