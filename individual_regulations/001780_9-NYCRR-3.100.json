  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.100 - Executive order no. 100: regulatory procedures; plain language\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn carrying out its mandate to protect the health, safety\nand welfare of the People, it is the duty of the State government to act\neffectively and efficiently, but without imposing unnecessary burdens upon the\ncitizens of the State, employers, or upon State or local government. It is a\nduty which has particular significance for State agencies charged with\nregulatory responsibilities. These agencies must cultivate and maintain a\nsensitivity to the impact of their regulatory activity and be constant in their\nefforts to reduce or to eliminate conflicting, duplicative or unneeded\nregulations. No new regulation should be adopted unless there is reasonable\nassurance that the regulation is no more demanding than is required to meet\nlegislative goals, and unless it is designed so that compliance may be achieved\nas simply and economically as possible. To achieve the goal of simplifying rules and regulations, and to encourage confidence in the regulatory process, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of New York, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the\n\nConstitution and Laws of the State of New York, do hereby promulgate this\n\nExecutive Order. I. Analysis of\n\nProposed Regulations; Regulatory Impact Statements. Before an agency proposes a rule or regulation, it shall\nevaluate the potential impact of such a rule or regulation upon those to be\nregulated, upon State and local government and upon the public. In order to\nensure that legislative purposes are met in as efficient a manner as possible, all State agencies shall carry out the following procedures: a. Except as provided in subdivision (e) of\nthis subsection, agencies shall publish a regulatory impact statement upon the\nissuance of any proposed rule or regulation. Such a statement or, in the event\nit exceeds 2,000 words, a summary, shall be submitted along with the proposed\nrule or regulation to the Secretary of State for publication in the State\n\nRegister. A copy of the statement in its entirety shall be provided to the\n\nGovernor, the Temporary President of the Senate, the Speaker of the Assembly, the Administrative Regulations Review Commission, the Office of Business\n\nPermits and, upon request, to interested parties. b. The regulatory impact statement shall\ninclude at least the following items: i. a\nconcise statement of the legislative objectives served by, the need for, and\nthe benefits to be derived from, the proposed rule or regulation; ii. the precise statutory authority for the\nproposed rule or regulation; iii. a\ndescription of the relationship between the proposed rule or regulation and any\nrelated State or Federal requirements or programs; iv. a description of, and a statement of the\nneed for, any new reporting requirements or forms that will be required for the\nimplementation of the proposed rule or regulation; v. an analysis of the costs involved to State\nand local government, to regulated parties and to the general public in\ncomplying with the rule or regulation, and of any other foreseeable economic\nconsequences; where an agency finds that it cannot provide a particular element\nof such an analysis, it shall state the reasons; vi. a discussion of viable alternative\napproaches to the proposed rule or regulation, and the reasons why those\nalternatives were not selected; and\nvii. the name, title, business address and\nphone number of a contact person within the agency. c. To avoid waste of agency resources, an\nagency may: i. consider a series of closely\nrelated and simultaneously proposed rules or regulations as one rule or\nregulation for purposes of filing a single regulatory impact statement; or\nii. file a single regulatory\nimpact statement for any series of virtually identical proposed rules or\nregulations which are proposed in the same year. d. When, pursuant to subdivision 3 of section\n202 of the State Administrative Procedure Act, an agency submits to the\n\nSecretary of State a notice of agency action in which it is stated that there\nare substantive changes in the final action in comparison with the proposed\nrule or regulation, the agency shall also summarize the changes, if any, which\nmust be made in the regulatory impact statement in order to reflect accurately\nthe impact of the final action taken. e. An agency may claim an exemption from the\nrequirements set forth above under any of the following conditions, provided\nthat it shall state the reason or reasons for claiming the exemption in the\n\nState Register at the time the agency publishes the proposed rule or\nregulation: i. where a rule or regulation must\nbe issued on an emergency basis, pursuant to paragraph (d) of subdivision 1 and\nparagraph (c) of subdivision 2 of section 202 of the State Administrative\n\nProcedure Act, in which event the agency shall publish, pursuant to the\nprocedures set forth in subdivision (a) of this subsection, a regulatory impact\nstatement within 30 days after the rule or regulation is effective; or\nii. where a rule or regulation\ninvolves only a technical amendment or an amendment to an existing rule or\nregulation solely to conform to the plain language requirement of subsection II\nof this Executive Order. f. The head of each State agency shall be\nresponsible for the agency's adherence to the requirements of this\nsubsection. II. Plain\n\nLanguage Requirement. Rules, regulations and forms shall be understandable to\nthose parties that must comply with their terms, instructions or directives, and to the public. Therefore, every agency shall promulgate its rules, regulations and forms in plain language, except where technical terms or terms\nof art must be used. Furthermore, agencies shall make every effort to examine\nexisting rules, regulations and forms in order to bring them into conformity\nwith this subsection. III. Definitions. As used in this Executive Order: a. Agency shall mean any department, board, bureau, commission, division, office, council or agency of the State, or a\npublic benefit corporation or public authority the head of which is appointed\nby the Governor. b. Proposed rule\nor regulation shall mean the proposed adoption, suspension, amendment or\nrepeal, whether on a permanent, temporary or emergency basis, of any \"rule\" as\ndefined by subdivision 2 of section 102 of the State Administrative Procedure\n\nAct, except where the proposed rule or regulation is defined by subparagraph\n(ii) of paragraph (a) of subdivision 2 of such section and its substance was\ninitially proposed by the regulated entity to which it would apply. c. Form shall mean the whole or part of any\n\nState agency permit, license, certificate, approval, registration, charter or\nsimilar form of permission required by law, rule or regulation having the force\nand effect of law and any written request to any party wherein data, facts or\nother information is sought. d. Interested parties shall mean any person, group, corporation, governmental or\nother legal entity requesting information concerning a proposed rule or\nregulation. IV. Nothing\nin this Executive Order shall be construed to create grounds for judicial\nreview or relief, nor shall this Executive Order be construed in such a way as\nto cause any undue delay in the orderly implementation of rules and\nregulations. V. This Executive\n\nOrder shall take effect June 10, 1980 and, unless extended, shall expire\n\nDecember 31, 1984. Signed: Hugh L. CareyDated: April 8, 1980\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
