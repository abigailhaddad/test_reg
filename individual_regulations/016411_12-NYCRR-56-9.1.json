  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-9.1 - Final cleaning procedures\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following cleanup procedures shall be required after\ncompletion of Phase II B activities: (a) Continuous negative pressure ventilation. If required during Phase II B, the negative pressure ventilation units shall\nremain in continuous operation during implementation of Phase II C, including\nobservance of settling/waiting periods and drying times. (b) First cleaning, lockdown encapsulation\nand top layer removal. All surfaces of the regulated abatement work area shall\nbe first wet-cleaned using rags, mops and sponges. For collecting excess liquid\nand wet debris, a wet purpose HEPA filtered shop vacuum may be used and shall\nbe emptied prior to removal from the regulated abatement work area. When the\nfirst cleaning has been completed, a thin coat of a lockdown encapsulant agent\nshall be applied to all surfaces within the regulated abatement work area which\nwere not the subject of removal or abatement. In no event shall lockdown\nencapsulant be applied to any surface which was the subject of removal or other\nabatement response activity, prior to obtaining satisfactory clearance air\nresults for the regulated abatement work area. Once the lockdown encapsulant\nhas been applied, and the appropriate waiting/settling or drying time\nrequirements of this Subpart have been met, the cleaned, exposed top barrier\nlayer of plastic sheeting shall then be removed from walls, ceilings and\nfloors. Windows, doors, HVAC system vents and other openings shall remain\nsealed. Decontamination system enclosures shall remain in place and shall\ncontinue to be utilized. (c) Second\ncleaning and bottom layer removal. After the top layer of plastic sheeting has\nbeen removed, all objects and surfaces in the regulated abatement work area\nshall be HEPA-vacuumed and then wet-cleaned. After the second cleaning and\nwaiting/settling or drying time requirements of this Subpart, then the\nremaining bottom layer of plastic sheeting on walls, ceilings and floors shall\nbe removed. All windows, doors, HVAC system vents and all other openings shall\nremain sealed. (d) Third or final\ncleaning and visual inspection. After the bottom layer of plastic sheeting has\nbeen removed, all objects and surfaces in the regulated abatement work area\nshall be HEPA-vacuumed and then wet-cleaned. After the final cleaning is\ncomplete, clearance air sampling shall not commence until the appropriate\nwaiting/settling or drying time requirements of this Subpart have elapsed and a\nvisual inspection has been completed by the project monitor to confirm that the\nscope of abatement work for the asbestos project is complete, and no visible\nasbestos debris/residue, pools of liquid, or condensation remain. The asbestos\nabatement contractor supervisor must complete a satisfactory visual inspection\nfor completeness of abatement and cleaning, prior to commencement of the\nproject monitor visual inspection. (1)\n\nProject monitor visual inspection. An appropriately trained and certified\nproject monitor, contracted by the building/structure owner, independent of the\nasbestos abatement contractor, shall complete the visual inspection. The\nproject monitor visual inspection for completeness of abatement and\ncompleteness of cleanup shall be performed as per the provisions of the current\nASTM standard E1368 \"Standard Practice for Visual Inspection of Asbestos\n\nAbatement Projects\". If the property owner is the asbestos abatement contractor\nfor the asbestos project, the owner shall contract with an independent project\nmonitoring firm asbestos contractor for the necessary visual inspection on the\nasbestos project. The asbestos abatement contractor and property owner, prior\nto the scheduling of the required visual inspection, shall provide a complete\nabatement scope of work for the asbestos project to the project monitor. An\nentry shall be made into the asbestos abatement contractor supervisor's daily\nlog by both the supervisor and the individual performing the inspection, detailing the findings of the visual inspection. The full name and NYSDOL\nasbestos handling certificate number of the certified individual performing the\ninspection shall also be documented in the supervisor's daily log. (e) Exemption from multiple\ncleaning and sheeting removal. When the regulated abatement work area is not\nrequired to be plasticized, or when a tent enclosure unit is used, one thorough\nfinal cleaning followed by the observance of the appropriate waiting/settling\nor drying time requirement of this Subpart shall be required. For regulated\nabatement work areas where one layer of plastic sheeting is allowed, such as\nthe use of spray plastic or pre-demolition asbestos projects, two cleanings\n(first and final), each followed by observance of the appropriate\nwaiting/settling or drying time requirements of this Subpart is required. Cleanings shall consist of all surfaces in the regulated abatement work area\nbeing HEPA vacuumed first and then wet-cleaned. (f) Waiting/settling and drying times\nrequirements. For sequential removals as per section\n56-8.6\n(b) of this\n\nPart, the most stringent waiting/settling/drying time shall be observed. (1)\n\nThe following waiting and drying times\nper material abated shall be observed for each stage of cleaning as per this\n\nSubpart: (i) fireproofing, plaster, TSI and\nother friable materials -12 hours\n(ii)\nabrasive removals of floor tile/mastic\nwith machinery -12 hours (such as a bead blaster, grit blaster, etc.)\n(iii)\nmanual removal of floor\ntiles/mastic - 4 hours\n(iv)\nmanual\nabatement of interior non-friable materials - 4 hours\n(v) incidental disturbance asbestos project -\n4 hours\n(vi)\ntent with glovebag\nabatement of TSI - 2 hours\n(vii)\nintact transite panel removals indoors - 2 hours\n(viii)\n\nExterior non-friable ACM abatement\nwithout negative pressure enclosure - None\n(h) Decontamination of tools and equipment. All equipment (except negative air ventilation system) and tools shall be\nremoved from the regulated abatement work area and properly decontaminated as\nper this Part, prior to commencement of clearance air sampling. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-9.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
