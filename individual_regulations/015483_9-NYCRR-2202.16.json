  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2202.16 - Rent decrease for reduction of services, etc\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The administrator may order a decrease of\nthe maximum rent otherwise allowable, or take action as provided in section\n2202.19\nof this Part, where there\nhas been a substantial deterioration of the housing accommodations because of\nthe failure of the landlord to properly maintain the same, or there has been a\ndecrease in the dwelling space, essential services, furniture, furnishings or\nequipment required under section\n2201.2\nof this Title. It shall be\nno defense, to an application to decrease the maximum rent, that furniture or\nfurnishings were removed on or after May 1, 1955 from a furnished housing\naccommodation with the consent of the tenant. The maximum rent for the housing\naccommodation shall be decreased by that amount which the administrator finds\nto be the reduction in the rental value of the housing accommodation because of\nthe substantial deterioration or decrease in dwelling space, essential\nservices, furniture, furnishings or equipment. The administrator may, however, take into consideration all factors bearing on the equities involved. (b) In any proceeding where the landlord has\ncomplied with the requirements to paint and decorate the housing accommodation, the order terminating this proceeding shall set forth the date when the\napartment shall again be due for a painting. (c) The administrator may order a decrease of\nthe maximum rent, where there had been a previous increase of the maximum rent\non the basis of a prior tenant's installation or use of a television antenna, and a new tenant has not availed himself of this service, by the amount of rent\nincrease formerly granted for such service; provided, however, that the present\ntenant file an application for the decrease of the maximum rent within 90 days\nfrom the date of taking possession of the housing accommodation. (d) The administrator may order an\nappropriate decrease of the maximum rent, where there has been a previous\nincrease of the maximum rent on the basis of the installation or use of cable\ntelevision services, and there is no lease or rental agreement, executed prior\nto January 1, 1973 specifically providing for such installation or use, presently in force, or such lease or rental agreement has terminated or\nexpired. (e) the administrator may\norder a decrease of the maximum rent based on an approved conversion from\nmaster metering of electricity, with the cost of electricity included in the\nrent, to individual metering of electricity, with the tenant paying separately\nfor electricity, and is in amounts set forth in a Schedule of Rent Reductions\nfor different-sized rent controlled housing accommodations included in\n\nOperational Bulletin 2014-1 governing electrical conversions issued pursuant to\nthis section and section\n2209.8\nof this Title by DHCR, 92-31\n\nUnion Hall Street, Jamaica, Queens, New York, and available at DHCR's website\nat\nwww.nyshcr.org\n(\nwww.hcr.ny.gov\n), and determined as follows: (1)\n\nDirect Metering. Where the conversion is\nto direct metering of electricity, with the tenant purchasing electricity\ndirectly from a utility, such Schedule of Rent Reductions is based on the\nmedian monthly cost of electricity to tenants derived from data from the United\n\nStates Census Bureau's \" New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey,\" as\ntabulated by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, 1 Centre Street, Suite\n2210, New York, New York, and available on its website at\nrentguidelinesboard.cityofnewyork.us. The charge for electricity is not part\nof the maximum rent and is not subject to this Subchapter. The resolution of\nany dispute arising from the billing or collection of such charge is not within\nthe jurisdiction of the city rent agency. A conversion to direct metering is\nrequired to include rewiring the building unless the owner can establish that\nrewiring is unnecessary. (2)\n\nSubmetering. Where the conversion is to submetering of electricity, with the\ntenant purchasing electricity from the owner or a contractor retained by the\nowner, who purchases electricity from a utility at the bulk rate, such Schedule\nof Rent Reductions is based on the median monthly cost of electricity to\ntenants derived from data from the United States Census Bureau's \" New York\n\nCity Housing and Vacancy Survey,\" as tabulated by the New York City Rent\n\nGuidelines Board, 1 Centre Street, Suite 2210, New York, New York, and\navailable on its website at rentguidelinesboard.cityofnewyork.us, adjusted to\nreflect the bulk rate for electricity plus a reasonable service fee for the\ncost of meter reading and billing, based on the maximum estimated fee included\nin the Residential Electric Submetering Manual revised October 2001, published\nby the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, 17 Columbia\n\nCircle, Albany, New York, and available on its website at\nwww.nyserda.org, and reflected in\n\nOperational Bulletin 2014-1. The owner or contractor retained by the owner is\nnot permitted to charge the tenant more than the bulk rate for electricity plus\na reasonable service charge for the cost of meter reading and billing. The\ncharge for electricity as well as any related service surcharge is not part of\nthe maximum rent and is not subject to this Subchapter. The resolution of any\ndispute arising from the billing or collection of such charge or surcharge is\nnot within the jurisdiction of the city rent agency. A conversion to\nsubmetering does not require rewiring the building provided the owner submits\nan affidavit sworn to by a licensed electrician that the existing wiring is\nsafe and of sufficient capacity for the building. (3)\n\nRecipients of Senior Citizen Rent\n\nIncrease Exemptions (SCRIE) or Disability Rent Increase Exemptions (DRIE): For\na tenant who on the date of the conversion is receiving a SCRIE or DRIE\nauthorized by section 26-405(m) of the City Rent and Rehabilitation Law, the\nrent is not reduced and the cost of electricity remains included in the rent, although the owner is permitted to install any equipment in such tenant's\nhousing accommodation as is required for effectuation of electrical conversion\npursuant to this subdivision. (i) After the\nconversion, upon the vacancy of the tenant, the owner, without making\napplication to the city rent agency, is required to reduce the maximum rent for\nthe housing accommodation in accordance with the Schedule of Rent Reductions\nset forth in Operational Bulletin 2014-1, and thereafter any subsequent tenant\nis responsible for the cost of his or her consumption of electricity, and for\nthe legal rent as reduced, including any applicable major capital improvement\nrent increase based upon the cost of work done to effectuate the electrical\nconversion. (ii)\n\nAfter the\nconversion, if a tenant ceases to receive a SCRIE or DRIE, the owner, without\nmaking application to the city rent agency, may reduce the rent in accordance\nwith the Schedule of Rent Reductions set forth in Operational Bulletin 2014-1, and thereafter the tenant is responsible for the cost of his or her consumption\nof electricity, and for the legal rent as reduced, including any applicable\nmajor capital improvement rent increase based upon the cost of work done to\neffectuate the electrical conversion, for as long as the tenant is not\nreceiving a SCRIE or DRIE. Thereafter, in the event that the tenant resumes\nreceiving a SCRIE or DRIE, the owner, without making application to the city\nrent agency, is required to eliminate the rent reduction and resume\nresponsibility for the tenant's electric bills. (4)\n\nEvery three years, upon the publication\nof a new New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, and tabulation of the survey\ndata by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, DHCR shall issue a new\n\nOperational Bulletin governing electrical conversions setting forth rent\nreductions based on the new survey data, and shall move to amend the\nregulations to incorporate by reference the new Operational Bulletin, the new\n\nNew York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, and Rent guidelines Board tabulation. At such time as New York State Energy Research and Development Authority issues\na new Residential Electric Submetering Manual setting forth a new maximum\nestimated submetering service fee, DHCR shall move to amend the regulations to\nincorporate that document by reference. (f) The amount of the reduction in maximum\nrent ordered by the administrator pursuant to this section shall be reduced by\nany credit, abatement or offset in rent which the tenant has received pursuant\nto section\n235-b\nof\nthe Real Property Law, that relates to one or more conditions covered by such\norder. (g) (1)\n\nCertain conditions complained of as\nconstituting a substantial deterioration of a housing accommodation because of\na reduction in an essential service may be de minimis in nature, and therefore\ndo not rise to the level of a failure to maintain an essential service for the\npurposes of this section. Such conditions are those that have only a minimal\nimpact on tenants, do not affect the use and enjoyment of the premises, and may\nexist despite regular maintenance of services. The following schedule sets forth conditions that will\ngenerally not constitute a failure to maintain an essential service. However, this schedule is not intended to be exclusive, and is not determinative in all\ncases and under all circumstances. Therefore, it does not include all\nconditions that may be considered de minimis, and there may be circumstances\nwhere a condition, although included on the schedule, will nevertheless be\nfound to constitute a decrease in an essential service.

(2)\n\nIn\ndetermining whether a condition is de minimis, the administrator may consider\nthe passage of time during which a disputed service was not provided and during\nwhich no complaint was filed by any tenant alleging failure to maintain such\ndisputed service, as evidencing that such service condition is de minimis, and\ntherefore does not constitute a failure to maintain an essential service, provided that: (i) for purposes of this\nsubdivision, the passage of four years or more shall be considered presumptive\nevidence that the condition is de minimis, with such four-year period to be\nmeasured without reference to any changes in building ownership or the tenancy\nof the subject housing accommodation; (ii)\nservices required to be provided by laws\nor regulations other than the Rent Law and this Subchapter shall not be subject\nto this subdivision.

The\naffidavit shall state that the conditions that are the subject of the\ncomplaint, answer or application were investigated by the person signing the\naffidavit and that the conditions exist (if the affidavit is offered by the\ntenants) or do not exist (if the affidavit is offered by the landlord).
