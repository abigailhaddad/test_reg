An employer's return of New York City earnings tax\nwithheld must be filed in the same manner as is provided for in Part 174 of\nthis Title. However, in determining the threshold for filing such employer's\nreturn, the amount of New York City earnings tax on nonresidents required to be\ndeducted and withheld shall be aggregated with the amounts of New York State\npersonal income tax, New York City personal income tax on residents, City of\n\nYonkers income tax surcharge on residents and City of Yonkers earnings tax on\nnonresidents required to be deducted and withheld, and the total of all such\nwithheld amounts determines the manner and timing of filing employer's returns\nand making payment of such withheld amounts.
