  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 484.4 - Exempt vehicles\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhere a motor vehicle becomes exempt from the provision\nof article 21 of the Tax Law, the carrier may relieve himself of the\nresponsibility of reporting the motor vehicle on each tax return by\nsurrendering his permit and plate or sticker to the Miscellaneous Tax Bureau\nfor cancellation. (See section\n474.6\nof this Title.)\n\nExample: A permit and plate were issued for a truck owned and\noperated by a farmer and used to carry produce from farms not contiguous to his\nown. Starting on November 1st the truck no longer carries produce from other\nfarms but is used exclusively for one of the purposes set forth in section\n471.5\nof this\n\nTitle. A return must be filed for November even though there is no tax due. However, if the carrier surrenders the permit and plate he is no longer\nrequired to filed a periodic return. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n484.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
