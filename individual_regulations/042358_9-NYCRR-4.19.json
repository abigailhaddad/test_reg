I. The head of each department, agency, board, commission or other entity under the jurisdiction of the Executive\n\nBranch shall: a.

Widely distribute the\npolicy statement by providing it to all employees, including it in new employee\norientation, and publicizing it in internal employee publications. c. Conduct appropriate training to instruct\nand sensitize all employees. d. Develop guidelines to ensure the swift and thorough investigation of\nallegations and complaints of sexual harassment and enforcement of appropriate\nsanctions including disciplinary actions. The affirmative action officer shall\nhave responsibility for processing complaints. Because of the sensitivity of\nthe issue, particular efforts should be made to conduct investigations with due\nregard for confidentiality to ensure protection of the complainant and the\naccused. Although the intent is to address and resolve these matters at the\nworkplace, victims should be informed of the various administrative and legal\nremedies available. The complaint procedure should provide for subsequent\nreview to determine if the sexual harassment has been effectively\nstopped. e. Provide the\n\nGovernor's Office of Employee Relations with a copy of the policy statement and\na brief description of the actions taken and planned in regard to preventing\nand combating sexual harassment in the State workplace, and report all\ncomplaints and their resolution to the Governor's Office of Employee Relations. As used in this Order, unwelcome sexual advances, requests\nfor sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature will\nconstitute sexual harassment when: 1. Submission to the conduct is either explicitly or implicitly a term or\ncondition of an individual's employment; or\n2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct\nby an individual is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such\nindividual; or\n3. The conduct has\nthe purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an affected person's\nwork performance, or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work\nenvironment. II. The Governor's Office of Employee\n\nRelations shall provide information to the entities covered by this Executive\n\nOrder to assist in the implementation and the operation of the policy\nestablished by this Executive Order.
