  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 100.5 - Special conditions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This\nsection governs the new construction of distribution lines, service lines and\nappurtenant facilities performed pursuant to this Part. (b) In unusual circumstances when the\napplication of this Part appears impracticable or unjust to either party, or\ndiscriminatory to other customers, the utility providing service or the\napplicant may file a petition, in accordance with the requirements of section\n3.5\nof this Title, for a special\nruling or for the approval of special conditions which may be mutually agreed\nupon before construction is commenced, which petition shall set forth relevant\neconomic, engineering, and environmental factors. (c) If the utility or the applicant believes\nthat the new construction of underground distribution lines, service lines or\nappurtenant facilities within a residential subdivision would be less\nenvironmentally desirable than the new construction of overhead facilities, it\nmay request that the Secretary of the Commission grant an exception. The\nrequest shall be sent to the secretary in accordance with the requirements of\nsection\n3.5\nof this Title. The request\nshall: (1)\nas between overhead and underground\nconstruction, compare the probable environmental effects associated with the\nresidential subdivision and any economic, engineering, or other factors\nconsidered pertinent to the case by the utility or applicant to be\nserved; (2)\nfor those instances\nwhere visual values would be diminished by underground construction, indicate\nfactors bearing on probable retention of significant flora, including the\nutility's practice with respect to trimming trees in the vicinity of the\noverhead facilities; (3)\nbe mailed\nto the Adirondack Park Agency, whenever the request will involve construction\nwithin the Adirondack Park; and\n(4)\nbe reviewed by staff. The secretary shall notify the utility within 60 days of\nreceipt of the request either that the request is granted or that it objects to\nthe request. If staff objects, the request shall be referred to the commission\nfor further review. Requests and petitions shall be granted or denied based on\nenvironmental, economic or engineering factors. (d) Service to a residential subdivision may\nbe supplied overhead under the following circumstances: (1)\nif no governmental authority having\njurisdiction to do so has required undergrounding and the utility can provide\nservice to the entire subdivision: (i) by\nextending its facilities no more than 600 feet in a cul-de-sac where a portion\nof the street within the subdivision is served by overhead facilities within or\nat the entrance of the cul-de-sac; (ii)\nby connecting an area between existing\noverhead facilities for a distance of 1,200 feet or less; Note: In order to determine whether 1,200 feet or more of\nfacilities must be constructed to connect existing overhead facilities, the\nmeasurement should be along the route of construction. This will usually be the\nstreet within the residential subdivision. (2)\nif no governmental authority having\njurisdiction to do so has required undergrounding, by installing service lines\nto new applicants from existing overhead lines. (e) Where a utility constructs overhead lines\nbecause of reasons in paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of this section, it\nshall report such overhead construction to the commission quarterly along with\na description of the project. (f) Where a one-pole extension, including but not limited to road crossing pole\nextensions, would enable an existing overhead distribution line to be connected\nto a proposed distribution line in a residential subdivision, such extension\nmay be installed overhead, rather than underground. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n100.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
