  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 595.16 - Determination of capacity for self preservation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The evacuation capacity of residents is a\nfunction of both the ability of the residents to evacuate and the assistance\nprovided by staff. Determination of satisfactory ability to evacuate should be\nmade prior to admission to a residential program. Such a determination may be\nreached by review of the applicant's history and a face-to-face interview which\nshows a capacity to evacuate equivalent to that of the general public. When\nuncertainty exists a time drill may be used for a more objective\nmeasurement. (b) Subsequent to\nadmission: (1)\n\nFor service enriched single\nroom occupancy and congregate programs, timed drills should be used to\nregularly evaluate the level of evacuation capability of program residents. Translation of drill times to evacuation capability may be determined as: (i) three minutes or less, prompt; (ii)\nover three minutes but not in excess of\n13 minutes, slow. Evacuation capability is based on the time of day or night\nwhen evacuation of the facility would be the most difficult (i.e., sleeping\nresidents or fewer staff present). Residents needing assistance in evacuating\nshould be assisted by staff to the extent that assistance would be available at\nthe time of day or night in an actual emergency. (2)\n\nFor apartment programs, there shall be a\nregular re-evaluation of the resident's capacity to self preserve, which shall\nbe documented by the program. Such reevaluation shall occur no less frequently\nthan yearly and should also occur when there is reason to suspect changes in\nthe resident's level of functioning. (c) Fire exit drills shall be conducted in\ncongregate and service enriched single room occupancy settings at least monthly\nat varying times of the day and night. Some drills may be announced in advance\nto the residents. The drills shall involve the actual evacuation of all\nresidents to an assembly point as specified in the emergency plan and shall\nprovide residents with experience in exiting through all exits. Actual exiting\nfrom windows shall not be necessary to meet the requirements of this section. Opening the window and signaling for help shall be an acceptable alternative. Records should indicate the time to evacuate, date and times of day, location\nof simulated fire origin, the escape paths used and comments relating to\nresidents who did not evacuate within the required time. (d) Residents and prospective residents shall\nonly reside in or be admitted to a type of residential program appropriate to\nthe individual's evacuation capability. (1)\n\nIf a resident or prospective resident is clearly capable of prompt evacuation, that individual may be admitted to or remain in any residential program of a\ntype appropriate to his or her functional level. (2)\n\nIf a resident or prospective resident\nfails to demonstrate a capability for prompt evacuation during a fire drill, the matter should be completely documented in the fire drill log and in the\nresident's record. Immediate steps should be taken to relocate the resident to\na location within the residence which will allow for easier egress for such\ntime as is necessary until another fire drill can be conducted (no more than 14\ndays) and the resident's behavior observed again. (3)\n\nIf any resident or prospective resident\nwould be excluded from a residential program because of inability to evacuate\nwithin the time limits above, an evaluation shall be conducted as described in\nthe most current recognized edition of the National Fire Protection Association\n101A, Alternative Approaches to Life Safety. Said codes are published by the\n\nNational Fire Protection Association, One Batterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02269\nand are available for review at the Department of State, Division of\n\nAdministrative Rules, One Commerce Plaza, 99 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY\n12231 and the Office of Mental Health, Bureau of Inspection and Certification, 44 Holland Avenue, Albany, NY 12229. If the resultant E-score yields an\nevacuation difficulty level of prompt, the applicant or resident shall not be\nexcluded for failure to evacuate within the required time limit. If the\nresultant E-score yields an evacuation difficulty level of slow, the applicant\nor resident shall not be excluded solely for failure to evacuate within the\nrequired time frame from a facility that is constructed to meet the slow\nevacuator standards of the current recognized edition of the Life Safety\n\nCode. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 14\n§\n595.16\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
