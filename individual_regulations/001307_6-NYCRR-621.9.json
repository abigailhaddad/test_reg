  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 621.9 - Settlement conferences\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Under certain\ncircumstances, a settlement conference may offer a more effective and efficient\nway to resolve disputes over applications than an adjudicatory proceeding. A\nsettlement conference is an opportunity for frank and open discussion between\nparties in the presence of an administrative law judge that may result in the\nresolution of outstanding issues. The purpose of the conference is to allow\nboth parties to participate in good faith in the process of narrowing and\nresolving areas of disputes. The further option of an adjudicatory proceeding\nmay still be exercised should resolution not be achieved. (b) The regional permit administrator may\noffer an applicant the option to participate in a settlement conference, or the\napplicant may request a settlement conference, if the application meets the\nfollowing conditions: (1)\nno draft\nenvironmental impact statement has been required to be prepared; (2)\npublic notice has been published (unless\nthe application is for a minor project); (3)\nno substantive public comments have been\nreceived or public concerns identified; (4)\nthere remain unresolved departmental\nconcerns with the proposed project that could result in either permit denial or\nsubstantial modification; and\n(5)\nthe applicant has agreed to a suspension of the time period for a decision\npursuant to section\n621.14\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (c) A settlement\nconference shall be conducted by an administrative law judge assigned by the\ncommissioner. (d) The parties to\nthe conference shall be the applicant and appropriate department staff, and\ntheir representatives. (e) Each\nparty shall be afforded an opportunity to present summary written documents and\noral statements in support of its positions. (f) The administrative law judge shall have\nthe power to: (1)\nset the time and place of\nthe conference; (2)\nhelp the\nparties define unresolved issues and their respective positions on\nthem; (3)\noffer opinions on the\nrelative merits of each party's position and alternative ways to resolve\ndisputed positions; (4)\ntry to\nfacilitate the settling of issues in dispute; and\n(5)\nclose the conference if no reasonable\nprogress towards resolution is being made. (g) The administrative law judge shall: (1)\nprepare a report which will identify the\nissues raised, identify the scope and nature of any settlement, and recommend\nfurther action on outstanding issues including the need for hearing; and\n(2)\nsend the report to the\nregional permit administrator and the applicant within 30 days of the close of\nthe conference. (h) On\nthe date the department mails a notice to the applicant granting the settlement\nconference time frames specified in this Part are suspended. Upon receipt of\nthe administrative law judge's report by the regional permit administrator such\ntime periods will resume at the same point they were suspended. (i) If an adjudicatory proceeding is\nultimately held on an application that used the settlement conference\nprocedure, an administrative law judge other than the one who conducted the\nsettlement conference shall preside. The presiding administrative law judge at\nthe adjudicatory proceeding shall not confer on the merits of the application\nwith the administrative law judge who conducted the settlement conference. No\npart of the settlement conference report shall be introduced into the hearing\nrecord without the consent of the department staff and the applicant. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
