Expenditures shall include but not be limited to: personal\nservice costs, supplies, materials, equipment, and related debt\nservice. (ii)\n\nEvaluation costs will\nbe reimbursed either as part of the tuition rate or through a separate\nevaluation rate, as warranted by the commissioner. Such separate evaluation\nrates shall be established by the commissioner and transmitted to the Director\nof the Budget for approval. (iii)\n\nFor purposes of establishing tuition rates, program expenses shall be offset by\nrevenues received for special education programs, as prescribed in subparagraph\n(2)(v) of this subdivision. (iv)\n\nAdjustments shall be made to reported financial data. Such adjustments may\ninclude but not be limited to: (a) any\nreported cost not considered necessary or directly related to the operation of\nthe specific approved special education program; (b) any reported cost that cannot be\nsubstantiated on field audit by adequate written documentation. Adequate\ndocumentation shall include but not be limited to: payroll records, allocation\nrecords, canceled checks, invoices, and depreciation schedules; (c) any reported costs incurred by the\nprogram as a result of unsound business practices or accounting practices not\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles; (d) excess depreciation or amortization costs\nincurred as a result of using accelerated methods or useful lives other than\nthose required for the Consolidated Fiscal Report; (e) costs incurred in less-than-arm's-length\ntransactions that are determined to be above the actual, documented costs of\nthe owner. Costs above actual, documented costs of the owner shall be allowed\nonly with written approval of the commissioner upon the establishment of the\ncost effectiveness resulting from the transaction; (f) interest expense on capital indebtedness\nor on working capital loans incurred in a less-than-arm's-length transaction\nbetween the lender and the borrower in excess of the prime rate of the lending\ninstitution. Interest rates in excess of the prime rate shall be allowed only\nwith written approval of the commissioner upon establishment of the cost\neffectiveness resulting from the transaction; provided, however, that interest\nrates on working capital loans shall be allowable if not disapproved within\nfive business days of receipt by the commissioner of a completed request for\napproval; (g) interest expense on\ncapital indebtedness resulting from an interest rate in excess of the prime\nrate of the lending institution plus one percent. Interest rates in excess of\nthe prime rate plus one percent shall be allowed only with prior written\napproval of the commissioner in cases where the program can establish that it\nwas unable to secure a rate of prime plus one percent or lower despite its good\nfaith efforts to do so; (h) interest expense on working capital loans in excess of the prime rate of the\nlending institution plus one percent. Interest rates in excess of the prime\nrate plus one percent shall be allowed only with written approval of the\ncommissioner in cases where the program can establish that it was unable to\nsecure a rate of prime plus one percent or lower despite its good faith efforts\nto do so; (i) interest expense on\nworking capital loans if conditions do not exist that warrant the loan. Documentation that the loan is warranted may include but not be limited to: (1)\ndocumentation indicating that tuition\nbillings or their equivalent were submitted to the appropriate funding sources\nby the program in a timely manner but tuition payments were not received in\naccordance with the written contract or payment schedule; and\n(2)\nevidence indicating that required\nfinancial report and financial statement data was submitted in a timely manner\nand in the format required by the commissioner, as prescribed in subdivision\n(e) of this section. (2)\n\nTuition reimbursement methodology. The\ncommissioner shall develop and recommend the reimbursement methodology to be\nused in the calculation of tuition rates for programs approved under articles\n81 and 89 of the Education Law to the Director of the Budget. In accordance\nwith section\n4410\n(10)(a)(i)\nof the Education Law, the\ncommissioner's municipal task force shall submit an annual report by December\n31st of each year to the commissioner providing recommendations on the\npreschool rate-setting methodology for the following school year. The Director\nof the Budget, in consultation with the commissioner, shall approve the\nreimbursement methodology. Any modification to the approved methodology, including but not limited to the nondirect care cost parameter, the hold\nharmless percentage, the rate of growth adjustment factor, the annual inflation\nfactor and other factors to be applied in determining the tuition rate for the\nschool year, shall require the approval of the Director of the Budget. (i) The reimbursement methodology shall be\napplied to base year data and other information submitted in the required\nfinancial reports and financial statements, as prescribed in subdivision (e) of\nthis section. The methodology shall also be applied to budget data used to\ncalculate budget based rates, to actual data used to calculate reconciliation\nrates and to audit data used to calculate final rates based on audit. (ii)\n\nThe data in the financial reports shall\nbe reviewed and adjustments shall be made in accordance with this\nsection. (iii)\n\nAnnual inflation\nfactors shall be applied to the appropriate financial report data after\nadjustments, with the exception of budget based rates, reconciliation rates and\nfinal rates based on audit. (iv)\n\nThe nondirect care cost parameter shall limit nondirect care costs as a percent\nof total reimbursable adjusted inflated costs before application of applied\nrevenues and before application of the total cost screen. (v) Applied revenues, as reported on the\nfinancial reports and statements, shall include revenue that, to any extent, defrays expenses included in the tuition rate calculation either for the\ntuition rate year or for prior years, consistent with section\n4001\nof the\n\nEducation Law. These revenues shall be subtracted from total costs after the\napplication of the nondirect care cost parameter. (vi)\n\nPer diem rates shall be controlled by\nthe total cost screen. The total cost screen calculation shall use a per diem\nrate for each education program for both the rate year and the previous year. A\nper diem rate shall be arrived at by dividing the total reimbursable costs by\nthe total care days used in the tuition rate calculation. Total care days shall\nequal the number of days in session multiplied by the full-time-equivalent\n(FTE) student enrollment. For 12-month programs, this will be the care days for\n10 months plus the care days for the July and August component. The total cost\nscreen shall consist of two types: (a) The\nhold harmless screen provides that if a program's per diem rate is reduced by\nthe nondirect care cost parameter, the final per diem rate shall not be reduced\nfrom the previous year's per diem rate by more than the hold harmless\npercentage unless the reimbursable costs have decreased by more than the hold\nharmless percentage. (b) The rate\ngrowth screen provides that a program's per diem rate from one school year to\nthe next shall be limited to the documented rate of growth of per pupil\nexpenditures for all public school districts on a regional basis multiplied by\nthe rate of growth adjustment factor. The data used to determine the rate of\ngrowth of per pupil expenditures for public school districts shall be derived\nfrom the department' s Information Center on Education report entitled \"Annual\n\nEducation Summary.\"\n(vii)\n\nThe tuition rate calculation shall use\nthe following formula: Per diem rate, after offsetting revenues and the\napplication of the nondirect care cost parameter and the total cost screen, times the number of days in session, equals the per child tuition rate. Separate rates for the 10-month school year component and the July and August\ncomponent shall be calculated using the same formula. (viii)\n\nThe tuition rate for special class\nprograms seeking initial approval shall be based on the regional weighted\naverage per diem tuition rate for two years until such time that the required\nfinancial statements and reports of the new program are received by the\ncommissioner. Separate regional weighted average per diem tuition rates shall\nbe used for school age programs and for preschool programs. The tuition rate\nfor the third and subsequent years will be calculated using the methodology\ndescribed in this subdivision only if the actual full-time-equivalent\nenrollment for the base year reported on the financial reports equals or\nexceeds the minimum number of full-time-equivalent students required for\nprogram approval, as prescribed in section\n200.7\n(c)(3)\nof\nthis Part. If the reported base year full-time- equivalent enrollment is less\nthan the required minimum enrollment, then the program shall continue to\nreceive the regional weighted average per diem tuition rate for the rate year\nuntil such time that the program's actual base year enrollment equals or\nexceeds the required minimum number of full-time-equivalent students. (ix)\n\nThe tuition rate for programs for\npreschool students with disabilities receiving special education itinerant\nservices pursuant to section\n4410\n(1)(k)\nof the Education Law, shall be\nestablished using the reimbursement methodology as set forth in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision and subparagraphs (i) through (viii) of this paragraph, with the following modifications: (a) Expenditures for teacher salaries and fringe benefits, expenditures associated\nwith substitute teachers, as well as expenditures for nondirect care costs as\nset forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, are reimbursable. (b) The tuition rate for providers seeking\ninitial approval to provide special education itinerant services shall have the\nestablished reimbursement methodology applied to the submitted budget and\nrelated statistical data. Historical costs submitted for other approved\nprograms operated by a provider, such as data pertaining to a special class\nprogram, may also be used to establish rates for newly approved special\neducation itinerant service programs. (c) Rates for the certified special education\nteacher providing special education itinerant services shall be published as\nhalf hour rates and billing by providers to municipalities must be done in half\nhour blocks of time. Billable time includes time spent providing direct and/or\nindirect special education itinerant services as defined in section\n200.16\n(i)(3)(ii)\nof this Part in accordance with the student's individualized education program\n(IEP). The difference between the total number of hours employed in the special\neducation itinerant teacher's standard work week minus the hours of direct\nand/or indirect special education itinerant service hours must be spent on\nrequired functions. Such functions include but are not limited to: coordination\nof service when both special education itinerant services and related services\nare provided to a student pursuant to section\n4410\n(1)(j)\nof the Education Law; preparation for\nand attendance at committee on preschool special education meetings; conferencing with the student's parents; consultation with the student's\nregular early childhood provider, classroom observation; and/or travel for the\nexpress purposes of such functions as stated above. For the purpose of this\nsubparagraph, parent conferencing may include parent education for the purpose\nof enabling parents to perform appropriate follow-up activities at home. Billable time shall not be less than 66 percent of any special education\nitinerant teacher's total employment hours; provided that the approved\nreimbursement methodology, developed by the commissioner and approved by the\n\nDirector of the Budget, may adjust this billable time threshold. Providers\nshall maintain adequate records to document direct and/or indirect service\nhours provided as well as time spent on all other activities related to each\nstudent served. (d) Special\neducation itinerant service rates will be calculated so that reimbursable\nexpenditures shall be divided by the product of the number of days in session\nfor which the program operates times the number of direct and/or indirect\nspecial education itinerant service hours per day times two. In instances where\nthe special education itinerant services are provided in a group session, i.e., two or more students with a disability within the same block of time, the half\nhour rate must be prorated to each student receiving services. Special\neducation itinerant service rates shall be paid based on the number of half\nhour units delivered, provided that the total number of units delivered shall\nnot exceed the recommendations for such services in the student's\nIEP. (e) Actual expenditures, revenues and statistical data for special education itinerant teachers shall be\nreported to the commissioner as described in subparagraph (1)(i) of this\nsubdivision. (f) Expenditures for\nrelated services as defined in section\n4410\n(1)(j)\nof the Education Law and section\n200.1\n(gg)\nof this\n\nPart are not reimbursable in the calculation of the tuition rate for special\neducation itinerant services. (x) For the purpose of this subparagraph, integrated special class programs are defined as those programs employing a\nspecial education teacher and one or more supplementary school personnel in a\nclassroom made up of no more than twelve preschool students with and without\ndisabilities, or a classroom that is made up of no more than twelve preschool\nstudents with disabilities staffed by a special education teacher and one or\nmore supplementary school personnel that is housed in the same physical space\nas a preschool class of students without disabilities taught by a non-special\neducation teacher. The tuition rate for preschool programs operating a special\nclass as defined in section\n200.16\nof this Part in an\nintegrated setting serving students with and without disabilities shall be\nestablished in accordance with the provisions set forth in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision and subparagraphs (i) through (viii) of this paragraph, with\nthe following additional provisions: (a) Expenditures, revenues, full-time equivalent (FTE) enrollment, based on 25\nprogram hours per week, and related statistical data for the preschool students\nwith disabilities and the other students who are enrolled in the same program\nshall be reported together in a single cost center. (b) After application of the nondirect care\ncost parameter, reported expenditures shall be reduced by the greater of actual\nrevenues received for students without disabilities or an amount calculated by\nmultiplying the reported FTE enrollment of students without disabilities times\nthe regional day care rate or a proration of the regional day care rate for\nchildren aged 3 to 5, as published in 18 NYCRR\n415.9, applicable to the time\nperiod for which the program operated. The total cost screen is then applied to\nthe resulting expenditures to determine the total reimbursable costs. (c) The per diem rate for each preschool\nstudent with disabilities shall be determined by dividing the total\nreimbursable costs by the total care days for the FTE enrollment of preschool\nstudents with disabilities. (xi)\n\nEstablishment of coordination rates by\nmunicipalities for service providers coordinating two or more related services\npursuant to section\n4410\n(10)(c)\nof the Education Law. (a) A standardized method for calculating\ncoordination rates for two or more related services established by the\ncommissioner and approved in advance by the Director of the Budget shall\ninclude the following provisions: (1)\n\nRates\nshall be established on a half hour service block basis. (2)\n\nThe half hour rate shall be no greater\nthan the related services rate per half hour established by the municipality\nand paid to the identified service provider. (3)\n\nPeriods of less than a half hour block of\ntime may be aggregated into half hour service blocks of coordination services\nfor billing purposes. (4)\n\nThe rate\nshall be paid for up to 10 sessions during the school year and up to two\nsessions during a summer program. (5)\n\nIn extraordinary instances, such as those\ninstances where extended periods of time are necessary for the coordination of\nthree or more related services, the municipality official may extend the number\nof service blocks for which the service provider will be paid. However, under\nno circumstances may the rate exceed the applicable related services rate. Municipalities must notify the commissioner in writing of each\nextension. (b) Municipalities must annually submit to the commissioner the coordination rates\nestablished, as well as documentation describing the method used to calculate\nsuch rates. (1)\n\nRates calculated by a\nmunicipality using the standardized method as defined in clause (a) of this\nsubparagraph will be deemed to be approved without further review by the\ncommissioner and/or action by the Director of the Budget. (2)\n\nWhere municipalities use a method other\nthan the one defined in clause (a) of this subparagraph, the alternative method\nmust be reviewed by the commissioner and individually approved by the Director\nof the Budget. (3)\n\nTuition rate adjustments may be made to\nan approved tuition rate for the following reasons: (i) Tuition rate appeals. A program may\nappeal the existing approved tuition rate for the current school year for the\nreasons specified in clauses (a) through (d) of this subparagraph if it can\ndemonstrate that the program would have insufficient resources to meet the\neducational needs of the student population being served. Programs shall submit\nrate appeals in writing, including supporting documentation, in the specific\nformat required by the commissioner and may request an opportunity to make an\noral appeal presentation. The commissioner shall provide programs with a\nspecific response to each appeal issue. Programs may file a tuition rate appeal\nfor the current school year for the following reasons: (a) Health and safety concerns relating to\nstudents or staff. This type of appeal may be filed at anytime during the\nschool year. (b) Compliance issues\nidentified by the commissioner's designated representative in the current\ntuition rate year. If compliance issues are contained in a site visit written\nreport that becomes final prior to January 1st, such issues shall be addressed\nin the current school year. Compliance appeals based on site visit reports\nreceived after December 31st shall be considered for inclusion in the\nsubsequent school year's original rate. Appeal requests resulting from site\nvisits must be submitted within 30 school workdays of receipt of the final site\nvisit report issued by the commissioner's designated representative. Compliance\nissues must be adequately documented in all financial data submitted to the\ncommissioner. (c) Compliance issues\nidentified by the commissioner's designated representative during a compliance\nreview. The criteria that shall be used to initiate a compliance review to\ndetermine whether the program is out of compliance with State or Federal\nstatutes or regulations include but are not limited to: complaints made by\nparents, school districts or any other party and/or requests made by a program\nfor technical assistance regarding compliance. Appeal requests resulting from\ncompliance review visits must be submitted within 30 school workdays of receipt\nof the letter from the commissioner's designated representative requiring the\nprogram to take corrective action. Compliance issues must be adequately\ndocumented in all financial information submitted to the\ncommissioner. (d) Approved staff\nnot hired. If staff was approved and funded on appeal but not hired in that\nyear and the funding was subsequently removed during the reconciliation rate\nprocess, programs may file an appeal for reinstatement of such funding for the\napproved positions in the appropriate tuition rate year. Such appeals must be\nfiled within 30 school workdays of receipt of the reconciliation tuition rate. The additional reimbursement in the tuition rate year will be limited to those\nappeal items originally approved and only to the extent such monies are\nreflected in the base year financial statements as excess revenues. Programs\nmust demonstrate that monies approved on appeal in the base year were not spent\non any other type of expenditure and that the program has retained the approved\nappeal monies in a reserve or liability account. (ii)\n\nCorrected rates. Tuition rates shall be\nsubject to correction when mathematical errors are found in the rate\ncalculation or there are reporting errors in the base year data. Requests for\nrate corrections shall be filed within 30 school workdays of receipt of the\ntuition rate by the program. (iii)\n\nReconciliation rates. (a) Prior to and\nincluding the 1994-95 base year. Annually, upon receipt of financial statement\nand financial report data submitted by the programs, tuition rates for the\nperiod represented by this data shall be amended, in whole or in part, using\nsuch financial statement and financial report data and applying the approved\nreimbursement methodology in effect for that financial reporting\nperiod. (b) For the 1995-96 base\nyear and thereafter. (1)\n\nAnnually, upon\nreceipt of financial statement and financial report data submitted by the\nprograms, tuition rates for the period represented by this data shall be\nrecalculated in whole or in part, using such financial statement and financial\nreport data and applying the approved reimbursement methodology in effect for\nthat financial reporting period for the specific purpose of developing the\ndollar amount of an overpayment/underpayment adjustment. Overpayment/underpayment adjustment means the difference between the\nrecalculated base year reimbursable costs and the previously established\ncertified tuition rate for that base year multiplied by the actual enrollment\nfor the base year. (2)\n\nThe\noverpayment or underpayment adjustment on a per diem basis shall be subtracted\nfrom, or added to, total costs per diem after the application of the total cost\nscreen calculation and before the per diem rate is multiplied by the number of\ndays in session in the formula set forth in subparagraph (2)(vii) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nThe per diem rates\nused in the total cost screen calculation, as set forth in subparagraph (2)(vi)\nof this subdivision, shall exclude the overpayment/underpayment\nadjustment. (4)\n\nIf a program will\nnot be in operation in the tuition rate year and subsequent years, no\noverpayment/underpayment adjustment shall be calculated. Instead, a\nreconciliation rate for this program will be established for the base year in\naccordance with clause (iii)(a) of this paragraph. (iv)\n\nRates based on audit. Tuition\nrates shall be subject to adjustment based on a final audit of actual program\nexpenses, revenues, enrollment and other relevant program information in\naccordance with section\n200.18\nof this Part. (v) Rates for new special case programs. The\ndepartment will accept a written request from a program to adjust rates\nestablished for the third year of operation which were based on a regional\nweighted average per diem, if the program demonstrates that the third year\nfull- time-equivalent enrollment equals or exceeds the required minimum number\nof full-time- equivalent students in accordance with section\n200.7\n(c)(3)\nof\nthis Part. (4)\n\nRegional\nmaximum per trip rates for students receiving transportation services under\nsection\n4410\nof the\n\nEducation Law. (i) Definitions. As used in\nthis paragraph: (a) Base year means the July\n1st through June 30th school period that is two years prior to the school year\nfor which the regional maximum per trip rates are calculated. (b) Base year data means the financial\ninformation and relevant student statistics that correspond to the base year to\nbe used as the basis for the regional maximum per trip rate calculations. However, if the commissioner in any given year determines that the base year\ndata is materially incomplete, then the year prior to the base year data shall\nbe used. (c) Student transportation\nexpenses means base year approved transportation. For rates applicable to\nreimbursement in the 1997-98 and 1998-99 school years, such data shall be that\nreported from the placement/payment code 20 on the system to track and account\nfor children which classifies data for preschool students receiving services\npursuant to section\n4410\nof the\n\nEducation Law; in future years, such data shall be from such system or a\nsuccessor system, as determined by the commissioner. (d) Region means a municipality, except that\nthe five counties constituting the City of New York are considered one\nregion. (e) Student means a\npreschool student with a disability enrolled in an approved program pursuant to\nsection\n175.6\nof this Title and section\n4410\nof the\n\nEducation Law. (ii)\n\nRegional maximum per trip rate methodology. (a) Data reported in the manner prescribed by\nthe commissioner in support of the requirements of section 4410, relative to\nper student transportation expenses, shall be used to determine the regional\nmaximum per trip rate. (b) For the\n1997-98 and 1998-99 school year, the basic formula to be used to calculate the\nregional average per trip rate is as follows: (the sum of base year\ntransportation expenses of students enrolled for 210 days who are transported\nwithin the region divided by the number of students enrolled for 210 days who\nare transported within the region) divided by (210 transportation days times\ntwo trips per day); such result equals the base year regional average per trip\nrate before limiting. For the 1999-2000 school year and beyond, the basic\nformula to be used to calculate the regional average per trip rate is as\nfollows: the sum of base year transportation expenses claimed for students\ntransported within the region divided by the one way trips within the region\nclaimed on an enrollment basis; such result equals the base year regional\naverage per trip rate before limiting. (c) For the 1997-98 and 1998-99 school year, the statewide average per trip rate equals: (the sum of base year\ntransportation expenses of students enrolled for 210 days who are transported\nwithin the State divided by the number of students enrolled for 210 days who\nare transported within the total State) divided by (210 transportation days\ntimes two trips per day). For the 1999-2000 school year and beyond, the basic\nformula to be used to calculate the State average per trip rate is as follows: the sum of base year transportation expenses claimed for students transported\nwithin the State divided by the one way trips within the State claimed on an\nenrollment basis. (d) The regional\naverage per trip rates will be calculated using twelve month (July to June)\ndata for per student transportation expenses unless the regional average per\ntrip rate separately calculated for the July/August component of the school\nyear exceeds the regional average per trip rate for the 12-month school year by\nmore than 15 percent, then separate July/August and September through June per\ntrip rates will be calculated. (e) The base year regional average per trip rate will be trended forward by the\nregional growth factor, which shall have been approved by the Director of the\n\nDivision of the Budget, for the purposes of establishing tuition rates as\ndescribed in clause (2)(vi)(b) of this subdivision. (f) Regional maximum per trip rates shall\nequal the regional average per trip rate but shall not be more than 25 percent\ngreater than the statewide average per trip rate. (g) Regional maximum per trip rates shall be\napproved by the Director of the Division of the Budget. (iii)\n\nRecordkeeping and retention. Municipalities shall maintain detailed student records and accounting records\nto document and support their claims. At a minimum, such records shall include\ntrip logs by type of placement, as prescribed by the commissioner, transporter\nname, vehicle classification (parent vehicle, taxi, yellow bus by capacity\nrange, and public service), number of one-way trips contracted for on an\nenrollment basis, number of students transported, total amount of the\ntransportation expenses paid by the municipalities for each claiming period, date(s) paid, amount of the State's share being claimed, student identification\nnumbers for students transported and proof of the committee on preschool\nspecial education placement for each child. The department will audit regional\nclaims according to an established schedule. Municipalities must maintain all\nrecords until an audit by the department relating to the transportation\nexpenses has been completed and is final, but for no longer than seven years\nfollowing the end of the school year. (iv)\n\nReimbursement. Municipalities shall be\nreimbursed on an aggregate basis for transportation expenses equal to the\nproduct of the regional maximum per trip rate and the number of trips claimed\non an enrollment basis or the actual expenses claimed, whichever is less. In\nprocessing each claim for a school year, the department shall compute the\nregional maximum allowable reimbursement based on the product of the\nyear-to-date number of one- way trips claimed on an enrollment basis by the\nmunicipality by the established regional maximum per trip rate. Payment will be\nmade for aggregate claims up to such regional maximum allowable reimbursement\nminus any payments previously made year-to-date for such school year. (v) Appeals. Upon submission of the final\nclaim for school year, municipalities may appeal the regional maximum per trip\nrate if the actual transportation expenses exceeded the regional maximum per\ntrip rate times the number of one- way trips, provided the reason for that\nexcess was due solely to the increase in the number of students with unusual\ntransportation related needs due to medical or behavior conditions. Municipalities must provide all relevant documentation to the appeal. Any\nregional transportation maximum per trip rate amended on appeal must be\napproved by the Director of the Division of the Budget. (g) Procedures during\nclose-down period. The owner(s) or operator(s) of an approved private program\nelecting to cease operation, transfer ownership or voluntarily terminate the\nstatus as an approved program shall comply with the requirements of section\n200.7\n(e) of this\n\nPart. For purposes of this subdivision, the close-down period means the period\nof time beginning with the date of the commissioner's receipt of notice and\nending on the date of the program's cessation of operation, transfer of\nownership or voluntary termination of its status as an approved program. Reimbursement shall be determined in accordance with the provisions set forth\nin paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section. Financial reporting requirements\nfollowing close down shall be in accordance with the provisions set forth in\nparagraph (e)(1) of this section. Such financial reports and financial\nstatements shall be submitted to the commissioner no later than 90 days\nfollowing close down. (h) State aid\nfor maintenance payments to private schools. (1)\n\nPrior to contracting with an approved\nprivate residential program for the instruction of a student with a disability, in accordance with the provisions of section\n4402\nof the\n\nEducation Law, a board of education shall notify the commissioner of the name\nand the county of residence at the time of the commencement of the school year\nfor which tuition is to be paid for such student, the name and address of such\nprivate residential program recommended, and the dates upon which such program\nwill commence and terminate residential care of the student. Evidence shall\nalso be submitted that there is no appropriate nonresidential program\navailable. (2)\n\nUpon approval of the\nproposed placement, the commissioner shall notify the appropriate social\nservices district of the placement of a student in a private residential\nprogram and of its obligation to pay for the maintenance of such student at the\napproved rate established by the Department of Social Services pursuant to the\nprovisions of section\n4405\nof the\n\nEducation Law and section\n153\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law.
