With the exception of pH and total solids, all results must be reported on a dry weight basis. (a) Each sample must be a composite of at\nleast five grab samples. (b) After\nthe digestate has been monitored for two years at the frequency outlined in\nthis paragraph, the department can reduce the annual number of analyses\nrequired if the material quality consistently meets the standards in Table 6 of\nsection\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart. (c) For digestate derived from non-sanitary\nwaste, the required analyses can be reduced depending on the use of the\nmaterial, as determined by the department. (iv)\n\nSufficient monitoring data must be\nobtained to demonstrate compliance with the pathogen and vector attraction\nreduction requirements, if applicable. The frequency and type of monitoring\nnecessary, based on the methods employed to achieve pathogen and vector\nattraction reduction, will be determined by the department. (v) The department can require analyses of\nthe material for maturity before distribution. This can include, but is not\nlimited to, organic matter reduction, plant growth impact, or oxygen\nconsumption. (vi)\n\nEach biosolids, septage, and sludge source must be analyzed in accordance with the following: (a) The required parameters for analysis are\nfound in Table 1 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart. (b) The minimum number of analyses required\ndepends on the quantity of waste digested, as outlined in Table 3 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart. (c) With the exception of pH and total\nsolids, all results must be reported on a dry weight basis. After the waste has\nbeen monitored for two years at the frequency outlined in this paragraph, the\ndepartment can reduce the annual number of analyses required if the waste\nquality consistently meets the quality standards. (d) Wastewater and partially treated\nbiosolids or septage that are generated at one wastewater treatment facility\nand treated at another wastewater treatment facility before beneficial use are\nnot considered separate waste sources subject to the criteria in this\nparagraph. The resultant biosolids or sludge generated for beneficial use are\nsubject to this paragraph. (vii)\n\nFor other wastes, analyses of the input\nwaste can be required, as determined by the department, based on the\ncharacteristics of the waste. The extent and frequency of sampling and\nacceptable concentrations will be determined by the department. (5)\n\nReporting requirements. (i) The annual report required by paragraph\n360.19(k)(3) of this Title, must include: (a) all information and analyses, including copies of the original laboratory\nsheets, required by this Subpart; (b) the type and quantity of the waste\ndigested, including the source of the material; (c) process operational information including\nmonitoring data and significant facility operational problems and any actions\ntaken to correct problems; (d) the\nquantity, by weight and volume, of digestate generated at the facility and the\nquantity of material removed from the facility; and\n(e) a description of the use of the\ndigestate.
