In addition, the\nagency or social services official may inquire whether any current employee or\nany person who is being considered for use as a volunteer or for hiring as a\nconsultant and who has or will have the potential for regular and substantial\ncontact with children who are being cared for in the group home is the subject\nof an indicated report on file with the Statewide Central Register of Child\n\nAbuse and Maltreatment. An inquiry regarding any current employee may be made\nonly once in any six-month period. (i) Prior\nto making an inquiry pursuant to this paragraph, the agency or social services\nofficial must notify, in the form prescribed by the department, the person who\nwill be the subject of an inquiry that an inquiry will be made to determine\nwhether such person is the subject of an indicated report of child abuse or\nmaltreatment on file with the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and\n\nMaltreatment. (ii)\n(a) Except as set forth in clause\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph, an agency or social services\nofficial may not permit a person hired by the agency or social services\nofficial or a person who is employed by an individual, corporation, partnership\nor association which provides goods or services to the group home to have\ncontact with children in the care of the group home prior to obtaining the\nresult of the inquiry required by this paragraph. (b) An employee of an agency or social\nservices official or an employee of a provider of goods and services to the\ngroup home may have contact with children cared for by the group home prior to\nthe receipt by the agency or social services official of the result of the\ninquiry required by this paragraph only where such employee is visually\nobserved or audibly monitored by an existing staff member of the agency or\nsocial services district. Such employee must be in the physical presence of an\nexisting staff member for whom: (1)\nthe\nresult of an inquiry required by section\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law has been received by the agency or social services\nofficial and the agency or social services official hired the existing staff\nmember with knowledge of the result of the inquiry; or\n(2)\nan inquiry was not made because such\nstaff member was hired before the effective date of section\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law. (iii)\n(a) When the person who is the subject of the inquiry is an applicant for\nemployment, the department will charge a five dollar fee when it conducts a\nsearch of its records within the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and\n\nMaltreatment to determine whether such applicant is the subject of an indicated\nreport. (b) The required fee must\neither accompany the inquiry form submitted to the department or, for an\ninquiry submitted by a social services district, the district may elect to have\nthe fee subtracted from its claims for reimbursement submitted pursuant to\nsection\n601.1\nof this Title. (c) Fees must be paid by agency business\ncheck, certified check, postal or bank money order, teller's check or cashier's\ncheck made payable to \"New York State Department of Social Services\". For\nsocial services districts electing to have the fees subtracted from their\nclaims for reimbursement submitted pursuant to section\n601.1\nof this Title, the fees will\nbe subtracted quarterly to match the number of inquiries made. Personal checks\nand cash are not acceptable forms of payment. (iv)\n\nIf an applicant, employee or other\nperson about whom an inquiry is made is found to be the subject of an indicated\nreport of child abuse or maltreatment, the agency or social services official\nmust determine, on the basis of information it has available and in accordance\nwith guidelines developed and disseminated by the department, whether to hire, retain or use the person as an employee, volunteer or consultant, or to permit\nthe person providing goods or services to have access to children being cared\nfor by the group home, except that any group home operated by a local social\nservices district which had guidelines for the review of persons who are the\nsubjects of indicated reports of child abuse or maltreatment operationally in\nuse prior to January 1, 1986 may continue to use the district guidelines in\nmaking the required determination. Whenever such person is hired, retained, used or given access to children, the agency or social services official must\nmaintain a written record, as part of the application file or employment or\nother personnel record of such person, of the specific reason(s) why such\nperson was determined to be appropriate and acceptable as an employee, volunteer, consultant or provider of goods or services with access to children\nbeing cared for by the group home. (v) If the agency or social services official\ndenies employment or makes a decision not to retain an employee, not to use a\nvolunteer, not to hire a consultant, or not to permit a person providing goods\nor services to have access to children being cared for by the group home, such\nagency or official must provide a written statement to the applicant, employee, volunteer, consultant or other person indicating whether the denial or decision\nwas based in whole or in part on the existence of the indicated report and, if\nso, the reasons for the denial or decision. If the denial or decision was based\nin whole or in part on the existence of such report of child abuse or\nmaltreatment, the statement must also include, in the form prescribed by the\ndepartment, written notification to the applicant, employee, volunteer, consultant or other person that: (a) he/she\nhas the right, pursuant to section\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law, to request a hearing before the department regarding\nthe record maintained by the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and\n\nMaltreatment; (b) the request for\nsuch hearing must be made within 90 days of the receipt of the notice\nindicating that the denial or decision was based on the existence of the\nindicated report; and\n(c) the sole\nissue at any such hearing will be whether the applicant, employee, volunteer, consultant or other person has been shown by a fair preponderance of the\nevidence to have committed the act or acts of child abuse or maltreatment\ngiving rise to the indicated report. (vi)\n\nIf in a hearing held pursuant to a\nrequest made in accordance with subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph and\nsection\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law, the department fails to show by a fair preponderance\nof the evidence that the applicant, employee, volunteer, consultant or other\nperson committed the act or acts upon which the indicated report is based, the\ndepartment will notify the agency or official which made the inquiry that, pursuant to the hearing decision, the decision to deny the application, discharge the employee, not to use the volunteer or consultant, or not to\npermit a person to have access to children being cared for in the group home\nshould be reconsidered.
