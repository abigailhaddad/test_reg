  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 217-5.5 - Emissions inspection procedures and test methods\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'General instructions for HDDV emissions\ntests': (1)\n\nEquipment to be used in\nconducting a smoke opacity test on an HDDV in accordance with this subdivision\nshall satisfy all specifications and standards for a smokemeter as set forth in\nthis Subpart, and be a model certified by NYSDEC pursuant to section\n217-5.6\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nInspectors performing diesel emissions\ntests of exhaust emissions and inspections of diesel exhaust emission equipment\nshall be certified by NYSDMV, NYSDOT or NYSDEC to perform HDDV emission\ninspections and testing, after successfully completing a training program\napproved by such agencies. Such certified inspectors shall follow SAE J1667\ntest procedures and, when specified, other procedures included in this Subpart. No ODEIS or certified inspector may issue an emission certificate of inspection\nfor a HDDV, unless that HDDV meets the requirements of this Subpart. (3)\n\nThe general procedures for a valid HDDV\nemissions inspection (smoke opacity) conducted by a certified inspector\npursuant to the provisions of this Subpart in accordance with SAE J1667 are as\nfollows: (i) prior to testing, verify that the\ncertified smokemeter and associated and/or required auxiliary test equipment is\ncalibrated in accordance with the requirements of the manufacturer. (ii)\ndetermine that the engine is at\noperating temperature as specified in SAE J1667. (iii)\nexamine the vehicle exhaust system for\nintegrity. If a detectable leak exists determine that the HDDV is in violation\nof paragraph 217-5.4(a)(3) of this Subpart. Discontinue the HDDV emissions\ninspection (smoke opacity) of any vehicle with a detectable leak. Do not resume\ntesting until the leak(s) is repaired. (iv)\nperform the smoke testing on at least\none exhaust tailpipe in accordance with SAE J1667. (v) ensure that the ambient temperature at\nthe test location is within the conditions range specified in SAE\nJ1667. (vi)\nbefore initiating the\ntest, determine that all accessories and any engine braking devices are turned\noff. (vii)\ndetermine that the\nengine speed governor is in proper operating condition by: (a) inquiring of the HDDV operator whether\nthe governor is in proper operating condition; or\n(b) if the determination cannot be made, instruct the operator that, with the transmission in either neutral (with the\nclutch disengaged if so equipped) or in park, gradually increase the engine\nspeed. If the engine speed increases uncontrollably, instruct the operator to\nimmediately release the accelerator pedal and the fuel supply to the engine. Discontinue emission testing of any vehicle with dysfunctional or\nout-of-specification engine speed governors. Do not resume testing unless and\nuntil speed governor repairs are made. Determine that the HDDV is in violation\nof paragraph 217-5.4(a)(3) of this Subpart if the necessary corrective action\nto repair the engine speed governor is not taken. (viii)\nif inspecting a vehicle which was\neither equipped by the vehicle or engine manufacturer or subsequently\nretrofitted in accordance with State or Federal law or regulation with a, diesel particulate filter, diesel oxidation catalyst, selective catalytic\nreduction system, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), or any other emission\ncontrol device, the certified inspector shall inspect the exhaust system for\nthe presence of the device and for its physical integrity. Discontinue testing\nof any HDDV which has been tampered with, exhibits any missing exhaust\nafter-treatment device or has perforating rust, crack, hole, tear, or other\nsuch physical defect in the device. Do not resume testing until the defect(s)\nare repaired. Determine that the HDDV is in violation of section\n217-5.4\nof this Subpart if\ncorrective action to repair the HDDV is not taken. (ix)\nif at any time before or during the\ninspection of a HDDV, continuous blue smoke is observed in the exhaust\nemissions for more than three seconds, discontinue the testing and determine\nthat the vehicle is in violation of section\n217-5.4\nof this Subpart. (x) at the conclusion of the diesel emissions\ninspection (smoke opacity) by a certified inspector, print a copy of a test\nreport produced by the CVIS, if applicable, or the smokemeter certified in\naccordance with subdivision\n217-5.6\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart and provide the report to the vehicle owner or\noperator. (4)\n\nVehicles\nfound in violation of this Subpart are not subject to impoundment or otherwise\nprevented from engaging in commerce as a result of this\n\nSubpart. (b) 'Annual\nNYCMA HDDV Inspection/Maintenance emissions inspections'. (1)\nNYSDMV certified motor vehicle inspectors\nperforming annual HDDV emissions inspections shall: (i) only affix a valid emission certificate\nof inspection to a HDDV that has met the diesel emission inspection (smoke\nopacity) requirements set forth in this Subpart; (ii)\nissue test result to the HDDV\nowner/operator for each test performed; and\n(iii)\nonly issue test result to the\nowner/operator for the specific vehicle that has been tested. (2)\n\nLicensed NYSDMV ODEIS and/or\nfleet self inspection facilities shall: (i) be\nlicensed/registered by the appropriate New York State agency to perform HDDV\ndiesel emissions inspections (smoke opacity); (ii)\nconspicuously display licenses required\nunder subparagraph 217-5.5(b)(2)(i) of this Subpart; (iii)\nmaintain test equipment in accordance\nwith this section, manufacturer's specification, and SAE J1667; (iv)\nmaintain a current copy of SAE J1667 at\nfacility or be accessible through a CVIS, if applicable; (v) not pass any HDDV which does not meet the\nrequirements set forth in section\n217-5.4\nof this Subpart; (vi)\nnot test or allow to test the exhaust\nemission on any HDDV which has been disqualified from testing for any reason\nuntil the reason for disqualification has been corrected; (vii)\nissue inspection results to the HDDV\nowner/operator for each test performed; (viii)\nnot affix or allow anyone to affix a\nvalid certificate of inspection to a HDDV unless it has met the emission and\ninspection requirements set forth in this section; (ix)\nnot issue or allow the issuance of test\nresults to an owner/operator unless those results are measured from the vehicle\ntested; and\n(x) maintain logs in\naccordance with a prescribed format. (3)\n\nFor the purpose of this subdivision the\nNYSDEC, NYSDMV, or an authorized representative, has the right of entry to any\npremises owned, operated, used, leased, or rented by ODEIS or fleet self\ninspection facility to test and inspect HDDVs for the purpose of inspecting and\nauditing facilities, records, and test equipment. (c) 'Roadside or random HDDV emissions\ninspections'. Certified inspectors performing roadside diesel emissions\ninspections shall: (1)\nbe specifically\nauthorized to perform such inspections at a public or quasi-public location\ndesignated by the New York State Commissioner of Transportation with the\nconcurrence of NYSDEC and, where appropriate, the New York State Thruway\n\nAuthority in accordance with the requirements set forth in this\nsection; (2)\ndirect the operator of\nthe vehicles to be inspected to move the vehicle to a safe location, if\nappropriate; (3)\nissue the\ninspection result to the HDDV operator for each test performed; and\n(4)\nonly issue the inspection result to the\nHDDV operator for the specific vehicle that has been tested.
