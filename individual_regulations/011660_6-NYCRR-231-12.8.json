  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-12.8 - Federal class I significant impact levels\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor the purposes of the PSD increment impact analysis in\nsupport of provisions of Subparts 231-7 and 231-8 of this Part, the following\nsignificant impact levels will be used to determine whether a new or modified\nfacility will have a significant air quality impact in Federal class I\nareas: Regulated NSR Contaminant\n\nAnnual Average\n24 Hour Average\n3 Hour Average\n\nSulfur Dioxide\n0.1 (MICRO)g/m\n3\n0.2 (MICRO)g/m\n3\n1.0 (MICRO)g/m\n3\n\nNitrogen Dioxide\n0.1 (MICRO)g/m\n3\n\nNot applicable\n\nNot applicable\nPM-10\n0.2 (MICRO)g/m\n3\n0.3 (MICRO)g/m\n3\n\nNot applicable\nCO\nNot applicable\n\nNot applicable\n\nNot applicable\nPM-2.5\n0.06 (MICRO)g/m\n3\n0.07 (MICRO)g/m\n3\n\nNot applicable\n\nAn analysis demonstrating that the maximum impacts from\nthe proposed new or modified facility for any regulated NSR contaminant are\nbelow these significant impact levels in PSD defined class I areas will be\ndeemed adequate as the required impact analysis to demonstrate that the source\nwill not contribute to a standards violation or a PSD increment exceedance for\nthat regulated NSR contaminant. However, such a demonstration will not exclude\nthe performance of any other required impact analysis to satisfy other\napplicable provisions of Subparts 231-7 to 231-10 of this Part, including the\nmodeling for air quality related values in Federal class I\nareas. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n231-12.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
