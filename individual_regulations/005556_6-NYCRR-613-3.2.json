The manufacturer's statement must\nbe in writing, indicate an affirmative statement of compatibility, and specify\nthe range of biofuel blends with which the equipment or component is\ncompatible. (2)\n\nRecordkeeping. Records required by this subdivision must be\nmaintained until the UST system is permanently closed in accordance with\nsubdivision\n3.5\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (d) Spill and overfill prevention. Facilities must be protected\nagainst releases due to spilling or overfilling in accordance with the\nfollowing requirements: (1)\n\nCategory 2 and 3\ntanks must have a label at every fill port indicating the tank's registration\nidentification number, design and working capacities, and type(s) of petroleum\nthat can be stored in the UST system. (2)\n\nFill ports must be color coded in\naccordance with API RP 1637 (April 2020). If a UST system contains petroleum\nthat does not have a corresponding API color code, the type of petroleum\ncurrently in the UST system must be identified (\ne.g., stenciled lettering) at or near the fill port. For any fill port connected to\nmultiple tanks storing different types of petroleum, the types of petroleum in\neach of the UST systems must be identified (\ne.g., with a label\nor placard) near the fill port. (3)\n\nMonitoring wells must be clearly identified (\ne.g., labeled as\n\"monitoring well\", color coded in accordance with API RP 1637 (April 2020)) to\nprevent the accidental delivery of petroleum and must be sealed or capped to\nprevent liquids from entering from the surface. (4)\n\nDelivery of petroleum to a UST\nsystem. (i) The operator, when on the\npremises or when in control of the delivery, is responsible for transfer\nactivities. If the operator is not on the premises and is not in control of a\ndelivery, the carrier is responsible for transfer activities. The requirements\nof subparagraphs (ii) through (viii) of this paragraph apply to the person\nresponsible for the transfer activities. The operator or carrier must employ\npractices for preventing transfer spills, overfills, and releases. (ii)\n\nOne of the transfer procedures described\nin NFPA 385 (2012 edition) or API RP 1007 (March 2001) must be used to comply\nwith the requirements of this paragraph. In circumstances of technical\ninfeasibility, practices must be developed and employed to ensure that releases\ndue to spilling or overfilling do not occur. (iii)\n\nImmediately prior to a delivery, the\noperator/carrier must determine that the delivery will be made to the proper\ntank system, the tank has sufficient capacity to receive the volume of\npetroleum to be delivered, and all ancillary equipment are in the appropriate\nposition to accept delivery. All couplings and other connections must be\ninspected to ensure that they are leak-free, undamaged, and fully functional. During and after the delivery, all couplings and other connections must be\nmonitored for leaks. (iv)\n\nImmediately prior to a delivery, fill port catch basins must be inspected to\nensure that they are empty. No deliveries may be made to the UST system if the\nfill port catch basin contains water, petroleum, or debris. (v) Brakes must be set and wheels chocked on\nall rail cars before and during the delivery. (vi)\n\nWhen a truck, rail car, or container is\nconnected to the delivery piping, caution signs must be in place to give\nwarning to persons approaching from any potential direction. Signs must remain\nin place until operations are completed, all connections are removed, and\noutlets properly closed. (vii)\n\nDuring the delivery, the operator/carrier must always supervise, monitor, and\ncontrol the transfer to prevent overfilling and spilling. The operator/carrier\nmust be trained in the proper transfer procedures and must take immediate\naction to stop the transfer of petroleum when the tank's working capacity has\nbeen reached, or if an equipment failure or emergency occurs. (viii)\n\nImmediately after a delivery, fill\nport catch basins must be inspected to ensure that they are empty. The fill\nport catch basin may not be left containing water, petroleum, or\ndebris. (e) Periodic inspection of overfill prevention equipment. Reserved. (f) Periodic\nmonitoring/testing of fill port catch basins and containment sumps used for\ninterstitial monitoring of piping. Reserved. (g) Periodic inspection/testing of\nleak detection equipment. (1)\n\nConnectivity inspections for electronic equipment. All\nelectronic monitoring systems must be inspected for connectivity at 30-day\nintervals. (2)\n\nOperability\ninspections. Reserved. (3)\n\nRecordkeeping. Records required by this subdivision must be\nretained for three years. (h) Periodic operation and\nmaintenance walkthrough inspections. Reserved. (i) Operation and maintenance of\ncorrosion protection. Metal tank system components must be protected\nfrom corrosion to prevent releases due to corrosion, until the UST system is\npermanently closed in accordance with subdivision\n3.5\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (1)\n\nCorrosion protection systems\nmust be operated and maintained to continuously and adequately protect metal\ntank system components that are in contact with the ground and routinely\ncontain petroleum. (2)\n\nCathodic\nprotection systems must be tested for proper operation by a qualified cathodic\nprotection tester in accordance with the following requirements: (i) Frequency. Cathodic\nprotection systems are tested within six months of the cathodic protection\nsystem's installation, reinstallation, or repair, and at yearly intervals\nthereafter. (ii)\n\nInspection\ncriteria. One of the following codes of practice (refer to section\n1.10\nof this Part for complete\ncitation of references) is used to determine that cathodic protection is\nadequate: (a) NACE TM0101-2012, 2012; (b) NACE TM0497-2012, 2012; (c) STI R051, January\n2006; (d) NACE SP0285-2011, 2011; or\n(e) NACE SP0169-2013, 2013. (3)\n\nImpressed current systems must be inspected for proper operation every 60 days. The inspection does not need to be conducted by a qualified cathodic protection\ntester, but must indicate: (i) the current\nrectifier readings (both voltage and amperage); (ii)\nwhether the current amperage reading is\nwithin 20 percent of the baseline amperage reading from the previous annual\ncathodic protection test; (iii)\nwhether the rectifier clock, if available, has been operated\ncontinuously; (iv)\nwhether the\nbonding cable connections are secure; and\n(v) any issues found and the actions taken to\naddress them. (4)\n\nRecordkeeping. Records required by paragraphs (2) and (3) of\nthis subdivision must be retained for three years. (j) Repairs and\nmodifications. (1)\n\nIf the tank\nsystem or any component thereof is inadequate or not tight, or any inspection\nshows that continuation of an operation or practice will result in a leak, then: (i) the operation or practice must be\nmodified or discontinued immediately; (ii)\nthe tank system or tank system component\nmust be immediately replaced; or\n(iii)\nthe tank system must be immediately\nemptied and taken out of service in accordance with subdivision\n3.5\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart before the necessary repairs and required subsequent testing are\nperformed, unless the tank system is permanently closed in accordance with\nsubdivision\n3.5\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (Examples which may indicate that a leak is imminent\ninclude: leaking valves, pumps, and pipe joints; inadequate gauges; tightness\ntest failures; excessive thinning of the tank shell which would indicate\nstructural weakness when the tank is filled; and malfunctioning pressure or\ntemperature gauges.)\n(2)\n\nIf the tank system or any component\nthereof, or continuation of an operation or practice, is not in imminent danger\nof causing a leak, but an inspection shows that the tank system is\nmalfunctioning or is in disrepair, and that a leak is likely or probable unless\naction is taken, then: (i) the operation or\npractice must be modified or discontinued immediately; (ii)\nthe tank system or tank system component\nmust be replaced within 90 days (unless a shorter time is deemed necessary by\nthe Department); or\n(iii)\nthe tank\nsystem must be taken out of service in accordance with subdivision\n3.5\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart before the necessary repairs and required subsequent testing are\nperformed, unless the tank system is permanently closed in accordance with\nsubdivision\n3.5\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (Examples of such equipment disrepair include: secondary\ncontainment dikes with erosion or rodent damage; deficiencies in coatings for\npreventing corrosion caused by exposure to the environment; malfunctioning leak\ndetection equipment; and cathodic protection systems which fail to provide the\nnecessary electric current to prevent corrosion.)\n(3)\n\nRepairs must be permanent, equal to or\nmore protective than the standards of original construction or manufacturer's\nspecifications, and must be accompanied by a signed statement from the person\nwho performed the repair that the repaired tank system component meets this\nrequirement. (4)\n\nRepairs to steel\ntanks must be made with steel welds or steel patches that are welded in place. Welds associated with tank repairs must be inspected and tightness tested\nwithin 30 days following the repair. (5)\n\nRepairs to fiberglass-reinforced plastic\ntanks must be made by the manufacturer's authorized representative in\naccordance with the manufacturer's specifications for such repair. (6)\n\nMetal pipe sections and fittings from\nwhich petroleum has leaked as a result of corrosion or other damage must be\nreplaced. (7)\n\nNoncorrodible pipes\nand fittings from which petroleum has leaked or that have been damaged must be\nrepaired or replaced. (8)\n\nFor a\npiping repair or replacement, a new piping run must be installed when 50\npercent or more of the piping run is removed, unless the piping run meets the\nrequirements of subparagraph 3.1(b)(2)(iii) of this Subpart. (9)\n\nWithin 30 days following the repair of\ntanks and piping, repaired tanks and piping must be tightness tested in\naccordance with paragraph 3.3(c)(1) and (d)(2) of this Subpart, respectively, with the exception of the following: (i) tanks\nthat are internally inspected in accordance with API RP 1631 (June 2001)\nfollowing the repair; and\n(ii)\ntanks and piping that are monitored for leaks in accordance with a method\nlisted under paragraph 3.3(c)(2), (3), (4), (5), or (7), or (d)(3) of this\n\nSubpart, as applicable. (10)\n\nWithin six months following the repair\nof any tank system component that is cathodically protected, or any repair or\nreinstallation of a cathodic protection system, the cathodic protection system\nmust be tested and inspected, as applicable, in accordance with paragraphs\n(i)(2) and (3) of this section to ensure proper operation. (11)\n\nRecordkeeping. (i) Records required by paragraphs (1)\nthrough (10) of this subdivision must be retained until the UST system is\npermanently closed in accordance with section\n3.5\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (ii)\n\nWritten documentation\nof all repairs of leak detection equipment installed on-site must be retained\nfor at least three years after the servicing work is\ncompleted. (k) UST systems in locations subject to flooding. (1)\n\nFor Category 1 or 2 tanks located in an\narea where the tank may become buoyant because of a rise in the water table, flooding, or accumulation of water, safeguards must be maintained in accordance\nwith section 2-5.6 of NFPA 30 (1984 edition). If such safeguards include\nballasting of a tank with water during flood warning periods, tank system\nvalves and other openings must be closed and secured in a locked position in\nadvance of the flood. Ballast water removed from the tank after the flood must\nnot be discharged to the waters of the State unless the discharge is in\nconformance with the standards of Parts 701, 702, 703, and 750 of this Title, as applicable. (2)\n\nFor Category 3\ntanks located in an area where the tank may become buoyant because of a rise in\nthe water table, flooding or accumulation of water from fire suppression\noperations, uplift protection must be provided in accordance with Sections\n22.14 and 23.14 of NFPA 30 (2012 edition).
