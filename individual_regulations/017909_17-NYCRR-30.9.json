However, no fee shall be imposed on petroleum transferred to\nthe licensee's major facility that has previously been transferred and subject\nto fee imposition. (b) The fee for\neach month shall be submitted to the commissioner, shall accompany the monthly\nreport and shall be received by the commissioner no later than the 20th day of\nthe month immediately following. The provisions of subdivision (d) of section\n30.8\nof this Part which relate to\nthe mailing and receipt of the monthly report shall also apply to the mailing\nand receipt of the fee. (c) The fee\nshall be paid by check made payable to the New York State Department of\n\nTransportation. (d) Each licensee\nshall maintain adequate records in accordance with accepted accounting practice\nto substantiate the monthly petroleum transfers to the major facility and the\nsource of such amount of transferred petroleum as is claimed not to be subject\nto fee imposition. In the absence of such adequate records demonstrating that\npetroleum claimed not to be subject to fee imposition has, prior to being\ntransferred to the licensee's major facility, been transferred and subject to\nfee imposition, such petroleum shall be presumed to be subject to the fee\nrequired by this Part. (e) An\nadditional fee shall be due for the late payment of the monthly license fee. The additional fee shall be assessed at a rate of one percent of the amount due\nper month. (f) If the monthly\nreport and fee required by this Part is not filed and paid, or if the report\nwhen filed is incorrect or insufficient and accompanied by an incorrect or\ninsufficient fee, the amount of such fee shall be determined by the\ncommissioner from such information as may be available, including, if\nnecessary, an audit of the licensee's books. The commissioner shall notify the\nlicensee, within 30 days after the due date of the monthly report and fee, that\nhe will determine the amount of the fee. The commissioner shall determine the\namount of the fee within 60 days after the due date of the monthly report and\nfee, and give the licensee notice of the amount of fee as determined by the\ncommissioner and of the licensee's right to appeal such determination. The\ncommissioner's determination may also include an additional fee assessed at a\nrate of one percent of the additional amount due per month, when the\ncommissioner determines that the licensee has unreasonably and unjustifiably\nfailed or refused to pay such fee or part thereof. Such additional fee shall\naccrue at a rate of one percent for each month until actual payment to the\ncommissioner. (g) The determination\nof the commissioner of the amount of the fee and/or additional fee due shall be\nfinal unless the licensee, within 30 days of receipt of the determination, applies to the commissioner for a hearing. Upon receipt of such a request for a\nhearing, the commissioner shall appoint a hearing officer who shall conduct a\nhearing in accordance with the provisions of the State Administrative Procedure\n\nAct and shall provide the commissioner with findings of fact and a recommended\ndetermination. The hearing shall be held within 60 days of receipt by the\ncommissioner of the request for hearing. The hearing officer's report and\nrecommendation shall be transmitted to the commissioner within 30 days of the\ncompletion of the record of hearing, including a full transcript. The\ncommissioner's final determination shall be made within 30 days of receipt of\nthe hearing officer's report and recommendation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
