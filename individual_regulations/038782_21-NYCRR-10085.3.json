Tit. 21 § 10085.3 - Supply of water\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every\ndwelling, house, or other building requiring the use of water must be supplied\nfrom the water mains of the water board through a separate board service\nconnection; provided that there is a permanent water main immediately in front, rear, or on either side of the premises. The commissioner shall determine the\nlocation of any connection to such water main. (b) If a water main is not existent in the\nmanner above-described, a temporary service may be laid from and connected to\nthe nearest available water main until a permanent water main is installed. Thereafter, when such service must be disconnected from the temporary source\nand reconnected to the permanent water main within 30 days from the date that\nwater is available in the permanent main. Such disconnection and reconnection\nshall be made by and at the expense of the owner of the premises supplied, and\nunder the supervision and subject to the written approval of the\ncommissioner. (c) The water board\nundertakes to use reasonable care and diligence to provide a constant supply of\nwater at a reasonable pressure to users, but reserves the right at any time, without notice, to shut off the water in its mains for the purpose of making\nrepairs or extensions, or for other purposes, and the water board shall not be\nliable for a deficiency or failure in the supply of water, or water pressure, or for any damages caused thereby, or by the bursting or breaking of any main\nor service pipe or any attachment to the board's water facilities. All users\nhaving boilers, hot water heaters, interior piping, etc. upon their premises\ndepending upon the pressure in the water board's pipes to keep them supplied, are cautioned against danger of collapse or bursting and all such damage shall\nbe borne exclusively by the users. (d) The supply of water to any building, premises or person for any purpose whatsoever is subject to the following\nconditions: (1)\n\nThe water board does not\nguarantee to the user any fixed or constant pressure, nor a continuous supply, these being subject to the various conditions which may arise in the operation\nand maintenance of the water facilities. (2)\n\nIn case of failure of any water\nfacilities or health hazard, including but not limited to, mains, service, pipes, pumping machinery, reservoirs or other equipment or through the\ncessation of operation of any pumps by virtue of the electric power being\ntemporarily cut off or discontinued, or for the purpose of testing, extending, repairing or cleaning water mains, service pipes or pump and filter station\nequipment, water service may be shut off as found necessary by the\ncommissioner, without notice to users and no claim will be considered and the\nwater board will not be liable for damage to service branches, boilers, machinery, plumbing or other fixtures, property or persons arising\ntherefrom. (3)\n\nWhen determined by\nthe commissioner to be essential for the protection of public health, safety\nand welfare in periods of drought or emergency, the right is reserved to\nrestrict, curtail or prohibit the use of water for secondary purposes, that is, sprinkling, car washing or filling swimming pools, etc., and the commissioner\nshall have the right to fix the hours and periods when water may be used for\nsuch purposes. (e) The\ncommissioner shall have the right, upon reasonable notice, to enter and inspect\nany premises or any part of all premises using water provided by the water\nboard, at any time that he or she may deem necessary or appropriate to, among\nother things, ensure compliance with these regulations, or when the\ncommissioner has reasonable cause or notice that a violation has occurred or is\nthreatened to occur. For this purpose, any city employee or authorized\ncontractor who may be designated by the commissioner, upon exhibition of proper\ncredentials or badges of the water board or the city, at reasonable hours, shall have free access to such premises. When such access is refused, the water\nmay be turned off at the option of the commissioner, and not turned on again\nuntil access is granted and a reactivation fee as identified in the board\nschedule of rates has been paid to water board and compliance is demonstrated\nto the satisfaction of the commissioner. (f) On and after the effective date hereof, whenever application is made for the service of water, the applicant will be\nrequired to pay the connection charge prescribed in board schedule of rates for\nevery installation or activation of a water service connection required for the\nservice of water to any premises or any part thereof. (g) A user service connection, including a\ncurb box and curb stop shall be required for each premises where the total\nquantity of water delivered and furnished thereto is to be billed and metered\nto a single consumer. If, however, the quantity of water furnished to a\npremises are to be separately and individually metered and billed by the water\nboard to the several occupants thereof, then a separate user service\nconnection, including a curb box and curb stop shall be installed for the\ndelivery of water to each part of such premises. (h) Upon acceptance of an application from an\nowner or occupant of any premises and upon payment of the applicable charge for\nthe size of a service to be installed as prescribed in the board schedule of\nrates, the water board will furnish, place, construct, operate, maintain and\nwhen necessary, replace, at its own cost and expense, the water service\nconnection to the water board's main. Easement and certificates of title issued\nby a title company licensed by the State, and acceptable to the commissioner, shall be furnished at the applicant's expense, when necessary for installation\nor reconnection of all board service connections. All board service connections\ninstalled by the water board shall remain the property of the water\nboard. (i) The owner or user has\nsole control of the water delivered beyond the board service connection. Neither the city nor the water board is responsible for maintenance, repair or\nreplacement of the pipes, valves, fittings or other equipment that connect from\nthe board service connection to any premises. At its own expense, the owner\nshall install, maintain and when necessary, replace the user service connection\nbeyond the board service connection together with a valve to be located just\ninside the building wall, permitting the control of water supply by the owner\nor user. For this installation and maintenance thereof, the owner or user shall\nemploy a licensed plumber and all work shall be performed in a manner\nsatisfactory to the commissioner. The minimum size, the materials, depth of\ncover and method of construction shall be as herein specified. If any defects\nin workmanship or materials are found, or if the owner or user's service\nconnection has not been installed in accordance with such specifications, or\nwith the water board's requirements, water service will either not be turned on\nor will be discontinued if such defects are not remedied. (j) No board service connection will be\ninstalled by the water board until the user service connection from the\npremises to the board service connection, including backflow prevention\ndevices, if required, have been installed in a manner satisfactory to the\ncommissioner. The water board may, however, install a board service connection\nto a premises, provided that the location of the board service connection has\nbeen satisfactorily identified to the commissioner, full payment for the\nproposed board service connection made, a request for water service has been\nsubmitted to the commissioner, and the main from which the board service\nconnection is to be installed has been accepted by the water\nboard.
