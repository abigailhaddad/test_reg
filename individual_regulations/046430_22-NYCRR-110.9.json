  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 110.9 - Transfer order\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When a defendant is in the custody\nof the commissioner in a secure facility pursuant to a retention order or a\nrecommitment order, the commissioner may apply for a transfer order pursuant to\nsubdivision 11 of C PL 330.20. A transfer order may not be issued when the\ndefendant is in custody of the commissioner pursuant to a commitment order. The\napplication for a transfer order may be made to the court that issued the order\nunder which the defendant is then in custody, or to a superior court in the\ncounty where the secure facility is located. Upon receipt of such application, the court may, on its own motion, conduct a hearing to determine whether the\napplication should be granted, and must conduct such hearing if the demand\ntherefor is made by the district attorney. (b) Form O prescribes the form and\ncontents of the application for a transfer order and the notice of application. Following the submission of such application, the court must grant the\napplication and issue a transfer order if the court finds that the defendant\ndoes not have a dangerous mental disorder, or if the court finds that the\nissuance of a transfer order is consistent with the public safety and welfare\nof the community and the defendant and that the clinical condition of the\ndefendant warrants his transfer from a secure facility to a nonsecure facility. The form and contents of this transfer order are prescribed in Form\nP. (c) A court must\nalso issue a transfer order (Form P) when, in connection with an application\nfor a first retention order (Form H), a second retention order (Form J), or a\nsubsequent retention order (Form L), the court finds that the defendant is\nmentally ill but does not have a dangerous mental disorder. (d) Whenever a court issues a\ntransfer order (Form P), it must also issue an order of conditions (Form\nN). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
