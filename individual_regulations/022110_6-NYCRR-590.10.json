  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 590.10 - Supplemental relocation payments, loss of favorable mortgage financing, incidental expenses\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to other payments and benefits authorized by\n\nState law, individuals and families displaced from dwellings on real property\nacquired by the Department of Environmental Conservation, who were in occupancy\non or after July 1, 1971 are entitled to supplemental relocation payments, payment for loss of favorable mortgage financing, and incidental expenses in\naccordance with the following criteria and eligibility standards. (a) General requirements to receive\nreplacement housing payments. (1)\n\nIn addition\nto the occupancy requirements as specifically enumerated herein, a displaced\nperson is otherwise eligible for the appropriate payments when that person\nrelocates and occupies a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling within one year, beginning on the latter of the following dates: the date on which that person\nreceives final payment from the State for legal damages directly connected with\nthe acquisition of his or her dwelling unit; or the date required to move from\nthe dwelling acquired; or the date on which that person actually moves from the\ndwelling acquired, if in fact this latter date is earlier than the date\nrequired to move. The date required to move is here defined and elsewhere in\nthis section as that date specified in writing by the State, by which the\nproperty must be vacated. (2)\n\nApplication for payments under this section shall be in writing on forms\nprescribed by the commissioner. The application must be filed no later than six\nmonths after the expiration of the one-year period specified immediately above, except that in cases litigated in the Court of Claims, the six-month period\nshall start from the date of final judgment of that court. (3)\n\nIf two or more eligible families occupy\nthe same single family dwelling unit, each family is eligible for a replacement\nhousing payment if they relocate to separate dwelling units. (4)\n\nIf two or more eligible individuals with\nno identifiable head of household occupy the same single family dwelling unit\nthey are considered as one family for replacement housing payment purposes. When all individuals do not relocate to decent, safe and sanitary housing the\ndepartment shall determine and pay those individuals who do relocate into\ndecent, safe and sanitary housing a pro rata share of the amount that would\nhave been received if all of the individuals had relocated together. (b) Supplemental payments; owner-occupants over 180 days who repurchase. (1)\nA displaced owner-occupant of a dwelling\nmay receive additional payments, the combined total of which may not exceed\n$15,000, for the additional cost necessary to purchase replacement housing; to\ncompensate the owner for the loss of favorable financing on his or her existing\nmortgage in the financing of replacement housing; and to reimburse the owner\nfor incidental expenses incident to the purchase of replacement housing when\nsuch costs are incurred as specified herein. (2)\n\nThe owner-occupant is eligible for such\npayments when: (i) that person is in occupancy\nat the initiation of negotiations for the acquisition of the real property, in\nwhole or in part; or\n(ii)\nthat\nperson is in occupany at the time he or she is given a written notice by the\n\nState that it is their intent to acquire the property by a given date; and\n(iii)\nsuch occupancy has been\nfor at least 180 consecutive days immediately prior to the date of vacation or\ninitiation of negotiations whichever is earlier; and\n(iv)\nthat person purchases and occupies a\ndecent, safe and sanitary dwelling within the time period specified in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (a). (3)\n\nThe replacement housing payment is the\namount, if any, which when added to the amount for which the State acquired his\nor her dwelling, equals the actual cost which the owner is required to pay for\na decent, safe and sanitary dwelling, or the amount determined by the\ndepartment as necessary to purchase a comparable dwelling, whichever is less. The State's determination of the amount necessary to purchase a comparable\ndwelling may be made on the basis of either of the two following methods: (i) The State may establish a schedule of\nprobable selling prices of comparable dwellings in the various types of\ndwellings being acquired. Such schedule may be prepared from an analysis of the\ncurrent probable selling prices of dwellings available on the market. (ii)\n\nThe State may determine the probable\nselling price of a comparable dwelling by analyzing those selected comparable\ndwellings available for sale which are most nearly comparable to the property\nbeing acquired by the State. All calculations or supplemental relocation payments are to\nbe predicated on the basis of the probable selling price of the available\ncomparable housing, not the asking prices. (4)\n\nAn owner-occupant desiring to retain his\nor her acquired dwelling may be paid a replacement housing payment according to\nthe following computations: (i) If the\ndwelling to be moved is decent, safe and sanitary, the payment shall be the\namount by which the cost to relocate the dwelling exceeds the acquisition price\nof the dwelling. The costs to relocate may include the reasonable costs of\nacquiring the dwelling, acquiring a new site and other expenses incident to\nretaining, moving the dwelling and restoring it to a condition comparable to\nthat before the move. (ii)\n\nIf the\ndwelling to be moved is not decent, safe and sanitary, the payment shall be\ncomputed as above except that the costs to cure the decent, safe and sanitary\ndeficiencies shall be included in the costs to relocate. (iii)\n\nThe payments computed under\nsubparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph may not exceed the amount which the\nowner would have obtained had he or she purchased a replacement dwelling and\nhis or her payment computed as per paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (c) Owner-occupant over\n180 days who rents replacement housing. An owner-occupant eligible for a\nreplacement housing payment under subdivision (b) of this section who elects to\nrent a replacement dwelling is eligible for a rental replacement housing\npayment not to exceed $4,000. The payment shall be computed and disbursed\naccording to the following criteria: (1)\n\nThe\npayment shall be determined by subtracting from the amount necessary to rent a\ncomparable dwelling for the next four years, 48 times the economic rental of\nthe dwelling unit occupied as computed by the State. (2)\n\nIn cases where the economic rental of the\nacquired dwelling exceeds 25 percent of the owner's gross monthly income, and\nhe or she elects to relocate into public subsidized rental housing, the\ncomputation of benefits will be in accordance with paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nThe State may\ndetermine the rental rates of comparable housing by a schedule or an individual\nanalysis of comparable available rentals. (4)\n\nThe payment under this section may not\nexceed the maximum amount the owner would have received had that person elected\nto repurchase a dwelling unit under the provisions of subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (d) Owner-occupant; less than 180 days but more than 90 days who purchases. A\ndisplaced owner-occupant otherwise eligible under subdivision (b) of this\nsection except that he or she has owned and occupied the dwelling for less than\n180 days but more than 90 days may receive an amount, not to exceed $4,000, to\nenable him or her to make a downpayment on the purchase of a replacement\ndwelling and reimbursement for actual expenses incident to such purchase; or\nfor additional costs to relocate his retained dwelling in accordance with the\nfollowing regulations: (1)\n\nThe amount of the\ndownpayment shall be determined by the State as the amount required as a\ndownpayment on a comparable dwelling if such purchase was financed with a\nconventional loan. (2)\n\nThe expenses\nincident to the purchase of replacement housing as described in subdivision (j)\nsucceeding. (3)\n\nUpon purchase and\noccupancy of a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling by the relocatee within the\ntime limits specified in paragraph (a)(1) the relocatee may be reimbursed: (i) the full amount of the downpayment\ndetermined in paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the eligible incidental\nexpenses if such total amount does not exceed $2,000; or if more than\n$2,000, (ii)\n$2,000, plus 50\npercent of the amount in excess of $2,000 providing the relocatee contributes\n50 percent of the amount in excess of $2,000. (4)\n\nThe full amount of the downpayment must\nbe applied to the purchase price of the replacement property and any\ndownpayment and incidental costs claimed must be shown in the closing\nstatement. To process for payment, the State must be furnished a copy of the\nclosing statement. If the owner elects to retain his or her dwelling, the\nreplacement housing payment will be determined in accordance with paragraph (4)\nof subdivision (b), except that such payment shall not exceed $4,000. If the\nowner first elects to rent a replacement property, but later decides to apply\nfor a downpayment on a purchase of a replacement property, any payments made\nunder the rental provisions are to be deducted from the payments authorized\nunder this paragraph. (e) Owner-occupant; less than 180 days but\nmore than 90 days; who rents. An owner-occupant otherwise eligible under\nsubdivision (b) except that he has owned and occupied the dwelling for less\nthan 180 days but more than 90 days, and elects to rent a replacement dwelling\nis eligible for a rental housing payment not to exceed $4,000. The specific\npayment will be determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of subdivision (c). (f) Tenant-occupant; over 90 days; renting replacement housing. (1)\nA displaced tenant is eligible for a\nrental replacement housing payment, not to exceed $4,000 when: (i) that person is in occupancy at the\nbeginning of negotiations for the acquisition of the real property; or\n(ii)\nthat person is in occupancy\nat the time he or she is given a written notice by the State that it is their\nintent to acquire the property by a given date; and\n(iii)\nsuch occupancy has been for at least 90\nconsecutive days immediately prior to the date of vacation or initiation of\nnegotiations, whichever is earlier; and\n(iv)\nthat person rented and occupied a\ndecent, safe and sanitary dwelling within the time period specified in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (a); (2)\n\nThe payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall\nbe determined by subtracting from the amount necessary to rent a comparable\ndwelling for the next four years the following amount: (i) 48 times the average monthly rental paid\nby the relocated individual or family during the last three months; or\n(ii)\nif such average monthly\nrental is not reasonably equal to market rentals for similar dwellings, the\neconomic rent as established by the State shall be used. (iii)\n\nThe \"rent being paid\" shall include any\nrent supplements supplied by others except when, by law, such supplement is to\nbe discontinued upon vacation of the property. (3)\n\nWhen the average monthly rental being\npaid by the relocatee, not including supplemental rent by public agencies, exceeds 25 percent of the monthly gross income of such individual or family, the payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be determined by subtracting 12 times\nthe average monthly income of the relocatee from: (i) 48 times the monthly rental determined by\nthe State as necessary to rent a private comparable dwelling if the relocatee\nmoves into private housing; or\n(ii)\nif the relocatee moves into public subsidized housing, the lesser of: (a) 48 times the monthly rental determined by\nthe State as necessary to rent a private comparable dwelling; or\n(b) 48 times the monthly rental the relocatee\nis required to pay if that person relocates in the subsidized\nhousing. (4)\n\nThe State may determine the rental rates of comparable housing by a schedule or\nan individual analysis of comparable rentals. (g) Tenant-occupant; over 90 days; downpayment for purchase. A tenant-occupant eligible for a rental replacement\npayment under subdivision (f) of this section who elects to purchase a\nreplacement dwelling is eligible to receive an amount, not to exceed $4,000, to\nenable him or her to make a downpayment on the purchase of a replacement\ndwelling, including the incidental expenses incident to such purchase. The\npayment will be computed in accordance with the provisions of subdivision\n(d). (h) Sleeping room tenant; over\n90 days. A displaced tenant of a sleeping room who is eligible for a\nreplacement housing payment under subdivision (f) may receive an amount, not to\nexceed $4,000, as a rental replacement housing payment or to enable him or her\nto make a downpayment on a replacement dwelling in accordance with the\nfollowing regulations: (1)\n\nFor rental\nreplacement housing the payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be determined by\nsubtracting from the amount necessary to rent a comparable sleeping room for\nthe next four years the following amount: (i) 48 times the average monthly rental paid by the displaced tenant during the\nlast three months; or\n(ii)\nif such\naverage monthly rental is not reasonably equal to market rentals for similar\nsleeping rooms, the economic rent as established by the State. (2)\n\nThe State may determine the\nrental rates of comparable housing by a schedule or an individual analysis of\ncomparable available rentals. (3)\n\nThe downpayment amount, including the expenses incident to purchase of the\nreplacement dwelling are to be computed in accordance with the provisions of\nsubdivision (d). (i) Increased interest payments; owner-occupant over 180 days who purchases. (1)\n\nAn owner-occupant, otherwise eligible\nunder subdivision (b), is entitled to a payment for the loss of favorable\nfinancing on his or her existing mortgage in the financing of replacement\nhousing, providing such payment falls within the $15,000 limit established in\nsubdivision (b) of this section, and further providing that the following\nconditions are met: (i) the dwelling acquired\nwas encumbered by a bona fide mortgage which was a valid lien on such dwelling\nfor not less than 180 days prior to the established eligibility date as\nspecified in subdivision (b) of this section; and\n(ii)\nthe mortgage on the replacement dwelling\nbears a higher rate of interest than the mortgage interest rate on the acquired\ndwelling. (2)\n\nThe\nincreased interest payment will be based on and limited to the lesser of the\nfollowing amounts: (i) the present worth of\nthe right to receive the monthly difference in mortgage payments on the\nexisting mortgage using the old and new interest rates; or\n(ii)\nthe present worth of the right to\nreceive the monthly difference in mortgage payments on the new mortgage using\nthe old and new interest rates. (3)\n\nPayment computation. The amount of\nincreased interest payment will be computed in accordance with the following\nprocedures: (i) The monthly principal and\ninterest payment differences caused by the change in interest rates is computed\nfor both the existing mortgage and new mortgage for their respective remaining\nterms and amounts. The old and new interest rates are used in each\ncase. (ii)\n\nThe present worth of the\nmonthly interest difference found in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph is\ncomputed for each mortgage by discounting the annual difference (the sum of the\nmonthly difference for one year) at the savings deposit interest rate for the\nremaining term of each mortgage. The lesser of the amounts so derived is the\nincreased interest payment. (4)\n(i) The\ninterest rate on the mortgage for the replacement dwelling to be used in the\ncomputation shall be the actual rate but may not exceed the prevailing interest\nrate currently charged by mortgage lending institutions in the\nvicinity. (ii)\n\nWhen the lending\nagency imposes debt service charges as an incident to the extension of credit, and such charges are normal to the market, the annual percentage rate shown in\nthe truth in lending statement shall be used in lieu of the mortgage interest\nrate in computing the monthly principal and interest payments. (5)\n\nDiscount rate. The discount\nrate shall be the prevailing rate of interest paid on passbook savings account\ndeposits by commercial banks in the general area in which the replacement\ndwelling is located. (6)\n\nTo whom\npayment made. The payment described in this paragraph may be made directly to\nthe relocated individual or family, or upon written instruction from the\nrelocated individual or family, directly to the mortgagee of the replacement\ndwelling. (7)\n(i) Where the dwelling is located on a tract\nnormal for residential use in the area, the interest payment shall be reduced\nto the percentage ratio that the acquisition price bears to the before value; except, the reduction shall not apply when the mortgagee requires the entire\nmortgage balance to be paid because of the acquisition and it is necessary to\nrefinance. (ii)\n\nWhere a dwelling is\nlocated on a tract larger than normal for residential use in the area, the\ninterest payment shall be reduced to the percentage ratio that the value of the\nresidential portion bears to the before value. This reduction shall apply\nwhether or not it is required that the entire mortgage balance be\npaid. (8)\n\nMulti-use\nproperties. The interest payment on multi-use properties shall be reduced to\nthe percentage ratio that the residential value of the multi-use property bears\nto the before value. (9)\n\nOther\nhighest and best use. If a dwelling is located on a tract where the fair market\nvalue is established on a higher and better than residential use, and if the\nmortgage is based on residential value, the interest payment shall be computed\nas provided above. If the mortgage is obviously based on the higher use, however, the interest payment shall be reduced to the percentage ratio that the\nestimated residential value of the parcel bears to the before value. (j) Incidental expenses. (1)\n\nAn otherwise eligible owner-occupant or\ntenant-occupant who purchases a replacement dwelling, is entitled to a payment\nfor the incidental expenses incident to the purchase of the replacement\ndwelling, providing such payment falls within the $15,000 and $4,000 limits as\notherwise established in this section. The following expenses, insofar as they\ndo not constitute prepaid expenses, are eligible for reimbursement on an actual\ncost basis: (i) Legal, closing and related\ncosts including title search, preparing conveyance contracts, notary fees, surveys, preparing drawings or plats, and charges paid incident to\nrecordation; (ii)\n\nLenders, FHA or\nVA appraisal fees; (iii)\nFHA or VA\napplication fee; (iv)\n\nCertification\nof structural soundness; (v) Credit\nreport; (vi)\n\nOwner's title policy\nor abstract of title; (vii)\n\nEscrow\nagent's fee; (viii)\n\nState revenue\nstamps; (ix)\n\nSales or transfer\ntaxes. (2)\n\nNo fee, cost, charge or expense is reimbursable as an incidental expense which is part of the\ndebt service, or finance, charge under the Federal Truth in Lending\n\nAct. (3)\n\nReimbursement for these\neligible incidental expenses shall be contingent upon showing the actual\nexpense and shall be accompanied by a copy of the closing statement for the\nreplacement dwelling. (k) Mobile homes; replacement housing\npayments; general provisions. (1)\nA mobile\nhome is considered to be decent, safe and sanitary if it meets the defined\nstandards in this Part. (2)\n\nWhere\nthe department determines that a sufficient portion of a mobile home park is\ntaken to justify the operator of such park to move his or her business or go\nout of business and the operator does in fact move or go out of business, the\nowners and occupants of the mobile home dwellings not within the actual taking\nbut who are forced to move are eligible to receive the same payments as though\ntheir dwellings were within the actual taking. (3)\n\nWhen a comparable mobile home dwelling is\nnot available, the supplemental relocation payment is to be calculated on the\nbasis of the next higher type dwelling that is available and meets the\napplicable requirements and standards, i.e., a higher type mobile home or a\nconventional dwelling. (l) Mobile homes; owner-occupants over 180\ndays. A displaced owner of a mobile home who has occupied, for at least 180\ndays, the mobile home on the site from which he or she is being displaced and\nis otherwise eligible under the provisions of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), is eligible for payments, the total of which may not exceed $15,000, for the\nadditional costs necessary to purchase replacement housing under the following\ncircumstances: (1)\n\nWhen owner-occupant owns\nboth mobile home and site, the replacement housing payment will be the amount, if any, when added to the amount for which the State acquired his or her mobile\nhome and site equals the lesser of: (i) the\namount the owner is required to pay for a decent, safe and sanitary\nconventional dwelling or a decent, safe and sanitary replacement mobile home\nand site; or\n(ii)\nthe amount\ndetermined by the State as necessary to purchase a comparable mobile home and\nsite. If the owner-occupant decides to rent, the rental\nreplacement payment shall be the difference between the State's determination\nof the amount necessary to rent a comparable mobile home and site for a period\nof four years and 48 times the economic rent of the existing mobile home and\nsite. The calculated rental replacement payment may not exceed the amount\ndetermined by the State in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, or\n$4,000, whichever is lesser. (2)\n\nOwner-occupant; acquisition of site only. Upon acquisition of the site, but not the home situated upon the site and the\nmobile home is required to be moved, the replacement housing payment will be\ndetermined as follows: the amount, if any, when added to the amount for which\nthe State acquired his or her mobile homesite equals the lesser of: (i) the amount the owner is required to pay\nfor a comparable homesite, or\n(ii)\nthe amount determined by the State as necessary to purchase a comparable mobile\nhomesite. If the owner elects to rent, the rental replacement payment\nshall be the difference in the amount determined by the State as necessary to\nrent a comparable mobile homesite for a period of four years and 48 times the\neconomic rent of the site acquired. The calculated rental replacement payment\nmay not exceed the amount determined by the State in subparagraph (ii) of\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, or $4,000 whichever is lesser. (3)\n\nWhen owner-occupant\nowns mobile home; rents site. The replacement housing payment will be the\namount, if any, when added to the amount for which the State acquired his or\nher mobile home equals the lesser of: (i) the\namount the owner is required to pay for a replacement dwelling; or\n(ii)\nthe amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to purchase a comparable mobile home, plus the difference in the\namount determined by the State as necessary to rent a comparable mobile\nhomesite for a period of four years and 48 times the rent being paid on the\nsite acquired. If the owner elects to rent a replacement mobile home, the\nrental replacement housing payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be the\ndifference in the amount determined by the State as necessary to rent a\ncomparable mobile home and site for four years and 48 times the economic rent\nof the mobile home plus the actual rent of the site acquired. (4)\n\nIn addition to the replacement\nhousing payments specified above, the owner-occupant is entitled to a payment\nto compensate him or her for the loss of favorable financing on his or her\nexisting mortgage in the financing of replacement housing and payment for\nincidental expenses incident to the purchase of replacement housing. These\npayments will be calculated and paid in accordance with subdivisions (i) and\n(j) of this section. (m) Mobile homes; owner-occupants less than 180 days, but more than 90 days. A\ndisplaced owner of a mobile home who has occupied, for less than 180 days but\nmore than 90 days, the mobile home on the site from which he or she is\ndisplaced and who is otherwise eligible under the provisions of paragraph (2)\nof subdivision (b), is eligible for an amount, not to exceed $4,000, to enable\nhim or her to make a downpayment on the purchase of replacement housing and to\nreimburse him or her for the actual expenses incident thereto in accordance\nwith the following provisions: (1)\n\nOwner-occupant owning both mobile home and site. If the owner purchases a\nreplacement dwelling, the replacement housing payment will be determined in\naccordance with the heretofore defined provisions relating to downpayment\ncalculations, except that the amount of the downpayment shall be determined by\nthe State as the amount required on the purchase of a comparable mobile home\nand site. If the owner-occupant elects to rent, the rental replacement payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be the difference in the amount determined by the\n\nState as necessary to rent a comparable mobile home and site for a period of\nfour years and 48 times the economic rental of the mobile home and\nsite. (2)\n\nOwner-occupant; acquisition of site only. If the owner purchases conventional housing or a site\nto which the mobile home is moved, the replacement housing payment will be in\nan amount determined in accordance with the provisions relating to downpayment\ncalculations except that the amount of the downpayment shall be determined by\nthe State as the amount required as a downpayment on the purchase of a\ncomparable site. If the owner-occupant elects to rent, the rental replacement\npayment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be the difference in the amount determined\nby the State as necessary to rent a comparable site for four years and 48 times\nthe economic rent of the site acquired. (3)\n\nOwner-occupant owns mobile home; rents\nsite. If the owner purchases replacement housing, the replacement housing\npayment, not to exceed $4,000, will be: (i) an amount determined in accordance with the provisions relating to downpayment\ncalculations, except that the amount of the downpayment shall be determined by\nthe State as the amount required as a downpayment on the purchase of a\ncomparable mobile home; plus\n(ii)\nthe difference in the amount determined by the State as necessary to rent a\ncompaarble mobile homesite for four years and 48 times the rent being paid on\nthe site acquired. If the owner elects to rent, the rental replacement payment\nshall be the difference in the amount determined by the State as necessary to\nrent a comparable mobile home and site for four years and 48 times the economic\nrent of the mobile home and the actual rent of the site acquired. (n) Mobile\nhomes; tenants over 90 days. A displaced tenant of a mobile home who has\noccupied for at least 90 days the mobile home on the site from which he or she\nhas been displaced and is otherwise eligible under the provisions of paragraph\n(f)(1) of this section, is eligible for a replacement housing payment, not to\nexceed $4,000. (1)\nto enable him or her to\nmake a downpayment on the purchase of a replacement dwelling and to reimburse\nhim or her for the expenses incident to such purchase; or\n(2)\nif he or she elects to rent, payment\nshall be the difference in the amount determined by the State as necessary to\nrent a comparable mobile home and site for four years and 48 times the actual\nrent being paid for the mobile home and site acquired. (o) Supplemental replacement housing\npayments; miscellaneous provisions. (1)\n\nInspection of replacement dwelling. In order to be eligible for and receive any\nsupplemental relocation payments, the State must inspect the replacement\ndwelling and determine that it meets the decent, safe and sanitary standards as\ndefined in section\n590.2\nof this Part. In any\napplication for payment, the individual or family must indicate that, to the\nbest of their knowledge and belief, the replacement dwelling meets the defined\nstandards for decent, safe and sanitary housing. (2)\n\nAdvanced replacement housing payments in\nlitigated cases. An advance replacement housing payment can be authorized and\npaid to a property owner if the determination of the State's acquisition price\nwill be delayed pending the outcome of a trial in the Court of Claims. A\nprovisional replacement housing payment may be calculated by deeming the\n\nState's maximum offer for the property as the acquisition price. Payment of\nsuch amount may be made upon the owner-occupant's agreement that: (i) Upon final judgment of the Court of\n\nClaims the replacement housing payment will be recomputed using the acquisition\nprice determined by the court as compared to the actual price paid or the\namount determined by the State necessary to acquire a comparable decent, safe\nand sanitary dwelling; and\n(ii)\n\nIf\nthe amount awarded by the court as the fair market value of the property\nacquired plus the amount of the recomputed replacement housing payment exceeds\nthe price paid for, or the State's determined cost of a comparable dwelling, the owner will refund to the State from the judgment amount, an amount equal to\nthe excess. In no event, however, shall that person be required to refund more\nthan the amount of the replacement housing payment advanced; and\n(iii)\n\nIf the property owner does not agree to\nsuch adjustment, the replacement housing payment shall be deferred until the\ncase is finally adjudicated and computed on the basis of the final\ndetermination, using the award as the acquisition price. (3)\n\nOwnership of replacement dwelling prior\nto displacement. Any person who has obtained legal ownership of a replacement\ndwelling any time after the initiation of negotiations on the project and\noccupies the replacement dwelling after being displaced but within the time\nlimit specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is eligible for a\nreplacement housing payment if the replacement dwelling meets decent, safe and\nsanitary standards. (4)\n\nPartial\ntaking situations. (i) Where a dwelling is\nlocated on a tract normal for residential use in the area, the maximum\nreplacement housing payment shall be determined by subtracting the \"before\nvalue\" of the property from the estimated selling price of a comparable\ndwelling on a lot typical for the area. (ii)\n\nWhere a dwelling is located on a tract\nlarger than normal for residential use in the area, the maximum replacement\nhousing payment shall be determined by estimating the value of the dwelling at\nthe present location on a homesite typical in size for the area and deducting\nthis amount from the selling price of a comparable dwelling on a site typical\nfor the area. (5)\n\nDwelling on land with higher and better use. Where a dwelling is located on a\ntract where the fair market value is established on a higher and better than\nresidential use, the maximum replacement housing payment shall be determined by\nestimating the value of the dwelling at the present location on a homesite\ntypical for the area and zoned for residential use and deducting this amount\nfrom the selling price of a comparable dwelling on a typical residential\nhomesite for the area. (6)\n\nJoint\nresidential and business use. Where displaced individuals or families occupy\nliving quarters on the same premises as a displaced business, farm or nonprofit\norganization, such individuals or families are separate displaced persons for\npurposes of determining entitlement to relocation payments. (7)\n\nPayments on assignments. Payments\ndescribed herein may be made, upon written instructions and assignment from the\ndisplaced person, directly to a lessor for rent or to a seller for application\non a payment for a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling. (8)\n\nOwner-occupant; prohibitions on double\npayments. If an owner-occupant eligible for the maximum $15,000 payment elects\ninitially not to repurchase a replacement dwelling, but rather to claim\nbenefits on the four year rent differential basis, he or she cannot receive\ndouble payment in excess of $15,000 if he or she later decides (within the\nallowable period) to purchase a replacement house. The amount of any payment\nmade on the rent differential basis is to be deducted from the calculated\ndifferential necessary to purchase a replacement dwelling. (9)\n\nAll rental replacement housing payments\nin excess of $500 will be made in four equal installments on an annual basis, except that prior to receiving such installment payment the tenant must certify\nto the State that he or she is occupying decent, safe and sanitary\nhousing.
