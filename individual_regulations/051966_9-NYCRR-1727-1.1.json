(b) Except as\nhereinafter provided in this section, all segments of the public will have an\nequal opportunity to apply for apartments. (c) No prospective applicant will be rejected\nbecause of race, creed, color, national origin, sexual orientation, military\nstatus, sex, age, disability, marital status, or familial status, except that\nan applicant must be at least 18 years of age and in the case of senior citizen\ndevelopments meet their age requirements at the time of application.

Any complaints in\nwriting alleging violations of these laws shall immediately be referred to the\ndivision for appropriate action. (d) All applications will be processed in an\nequitable manner. (e) Applications\nmust identify all of the applicants as well as any additional prospective\nresidents. The prospective household composition must conform to the occupancy\nstandards for the dwelling unit size requested at the time of application and\nat the time of availability. Applicants and any additional prospective\nresidents must be living together at the time of application and at the time of\navailability; provided, however, that a housing company may adopt a uniform\npolicy, but is not required to, which allows changes in household composition\nto be made on condition that an original adult applicant must remain on the\napplication at all times and move in at the time of availability. (f) Income of prospective tenant or\ncooperator will not exceed the applicable income limit either at the time of\napplication or at the time of apartment availability. (g) Applications for admission and\nintraproject transfer require the division's approval prior to assignment of\nthe dwelling unit. (h) Vietnam\nveteran's preference. Preference in admission to a project shall be given by a\nlimited profit housing company (including those companies participating in the\nlow rent assistance program) to persons or surviving spouses of persons who: (1)\nhave served in the Armed Forces of the\n\nUnited States for a period of at least six months (or any shorter period which\nterminated due to death or injury in such service), provided some portion of\nthe period of service was between February 28, 1961 and May 7, 1975, the\nofficial date of the termination of the conflict in Vietnam; and\n(2)\nhave been thereafter discharged or\nreleased therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable, or died in such\nservice, not more than five years prior to the time of application for\nadmission to the project. (i) Disabled veterans preference. Preference\nin admission to a project with an open waiting list, as determined by the\ndivision, shall be given to disabled veterans as such term is defined pursuant\nto section\n85\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law. For projects with a closed list, as determined by the\ndivision, such preference shall be given upon the opening of the waiting list. Notwithstanding the foregoing, persons who are already residing in a project\nshall be given first priority for an internal transfer within the housing\ndevelopment in which they are residing in accordance with section\n1727-1.3\nof this Subpart. (j) Priority in admission for applicants\nfound eligible in accordance with the provisions of subdivisions (a) through\n(i) of this section shall, in accordance with an affirmative fair housing\nmarketing plan approved by the division, be determined as follows: (1)\n\nFirst, in the following order, applicants\nqualifying as project displacees (families displaced by a limited profit\nhousing project): (i) Vietnam veterans or\ntheir surviving spouses; (ii)\ndisabled veterans; and\n(iii)\nall\nother qualified persons. (2)\n\nSecond, in the following order, applicants not qualifying as project displacees: (i) Vietnam veterans or their surviving\nspouses; (ii)\ndisabled\nveterans; (iii)\nwhere housing\ndevelopments have apartments which were designed for or modified to accommodate\naged or mobility-impaired persons, as the case may be, priority for such\napartments is to be given to applicants whose households include aged or\nmobility-impaired persons. However, such priorities should not result in any\nsuch applicant being denied a standard apartment; (iv)\ncategories of applicants established by: (a) either the State or Federal government\nfor programs in which the housing company is a participant; or\n(b) the division in response to emergency\nsituations in a ratio to be determined by the division; and\n(v) all other qualified\npersons. (3)\n\nThese\npriorities shall apply to new tenants only and not to intra-project transfers, except in the case of those tenants who are aged or mobility-impaired pursuant\nto section\n1727-1.3\n(c)(2)(iii)\nof this Subpart. (k) Housing companies are required to have in effect an affirmative fair housing\nmarketing plan. In order to qualify for approval by the division, such plan\nshall include, but not be limited to: identifying those racial/ethnic groups\nwhich have traditionally not applied for admission to the projects because of\nneighborhood characteristics or other factors; identifying those racial/ethnic\ngroups which are least likely to apply in the future unless there is special\noutreach to attract them; identifying which community, religious, civil or\nfraternal organizations will be utilized in conducting this outreach, with a\ndescription of how they will be utilized, and a description of any other\nadvertising and promotion techniques to be undertaken in connection with sales\nor rental activity. Affirmative fair housing marketing plans will be evaluated\non the basis of their appropriateness and potential effectiveness in attracting\ntarget groups to the project for future occupancy. In addition, implementation\ncapability by existing rental/sales staff, and project profiles on current rent\nor carrying charges, vacancy rates and the size of waiting lists, will be taken\ninto consideration in the evaluation process. (l) Upon the request of the division, the\nhousing company shall report on any and all aspects of its fair housing\npractices. Areas of concern shall include, but not be limited to, the\nprovisions of this section, processing of applications, maintaining of waiting\nlists, and the initiation and implementation of a sales and marketing\nprogram.
