The primary purpose of the quarterly\ninspection is to evaluate the physical condition of the facilities and the\nequipment in order to gain information to establish a progressive maintenance\nprogram. Correction of deficiencies found in the\ncourse of the inspection should be limited to emergency and minor items. II SCHEDULING\nThe inspection should be scheduled to\nensure that each facility will be observed at the most appropriate season, e.g., inspection of lawns and plantings during the growing season and the\nheating plant just before the heating season. The structure's interior and envelope can\nbe inspected year round, except for roofs when there is snow. Stagger\ninspection of the structure throughout the year so that correction of found\ndeficiencies will not fall too far behind inspections. Inspections of the structure's interior\nshould be completed as far as practicable in one visit. Mechanical areas and related equipment\n(pumps, refrigerator units, motors, compressors, heating and air conditioning\nunits should be inspected within reasonable periods of time. Inspection of items involving health and\nsafety should not be limited to a quarterly basis, but should be made as\nfrequently as necessary to avoid danger to the public and court\npersonnel. III EXTERIOR\nA. Grounds\n\nThe entire perimeter of a court facility\narea should be surveyed systematically paying particular attention to the\nfollowing: (See Section I - Frequency Cleaning Schedules, Table T-1). 1. Lawns (turf areas)\n\nEstablish a formal program of lawn care\nusing the standards of the New York State Department of Parks. Look for density\nof grass; relative coverage desirable to undesirable growth; bare spots; adequacy of drainage; degree and quality of maintenance, e.g., mowing, watering\nand fertilizing. 2. Plants\n(trees, shrubs, hedges and vines)\n\nLook for character of growth; shape and\nstructure; injurious disease and insect infestation; degree and quality of\nmaintenance; e.g., pruning. 3. Paved areas (streets, roads, drives, walks, sitting areas, cut curbs, gutters and traffic markings)\n\nLook for cleanliness; failures in the\nsurface and base; settlement; adequacy of drainage facilities; degree and\nquality of maintenance and condition of expansion joints. 4. Yard drainage (catch basins, inlets, ditches, pipe lines and swales) Look for flat undrainable or eroded areas; stoppage by rubbish and silt; adequacy as to capacity to meet peak demand; degree and quality of maintenance. 5. Grounds appurtenances (benches, posts, fences, guard rails, railings, lighting, retaining walls, steps, flag poles, street signs, handicap signage and related equipment). Look for worn out, damaged, or missing\nparts, lack of paint or other surface covering; degree and quality of\nmaintenance and services; corrosion at the ground line of metal posts; rotting\nof wood members; jagged or sharp edges of posts; branches and twigs protruding\nover walked areas and hanging at eye level or other hazardous\nconditions. B. Snow Removal\n\nVehicles and related equipment should be in\ngood mechanical condition, winterized and maintained in accordance with\nmanufacturer's specifications. Procedures should be developed and\nstandardized to meet climatic conditions and the court facility's needs. A. Structures\n\nMaintain a visual inspection of the\nbuildings for evidence of cracks, joint sealant failure, breaks, deterioration, settling, etc. Any indication of any structural problem should be brought to\nthe attention of the municipality immediately. The exterior appearance of\nstructures must be maintained at levels which are indicative of good building\nmanagement practices. For garage buildings and parking areas, see\n\nSec. I, Frequency Cleaning Schedules T-18. B. Roofs\n\nThe maintenance program should be\nimplemented by semi-annual inspections of all roofs. C. Hardware (Exterior Doors) Hardware, door-checks and other operating mechanisms of exterior doors should be\ninspected in the spring and fall. Changes in temperature necessitate adjustment\nof door checks. Lubrication of components should be carried out on a regular\nbasis. Automatic doors require special services which should be handled by the\nmanufacturer's maintenance organization. D. Interior of Facility\n1. Painting and decorating\n\nExamine walls, ceilings, window sashes, trim, doors, closets and other painted surfaces for flaking, peeling, alligatoring, mold markings, wear, discoloration and dirt. Note any cracking, flaking or other damage in plaster or sheetrock covering of walls and ceilings. Inspect windows and door frames for cracking or missing putty and caulking, tightness and drying. Check doors and windows for proper operation. The right combination of colors can build\nefficiency in an office as color can complement lighting, thereby relaxing\ntensions, improving morale and decreasing absenteeism. Colors should not be\ndistracting or disturbing, as this diverts attention from work. Light pastel\ncolors are generally recommended for interior wall surfaces, but it is\npreferable to use warm colors for rooms which receive little or no\nsunlight. 2. Floors\n\nLook at floors noting scars, worn areas, broken or loose tile, torn or worn carpet, condition of linoleum; need to\nvacuum, shampoo, clean and wax; indentation by furniture, evidence of water\nunder floor covering and condition of baseboards or cove molding. 3. Wisndow shades, blinds, draperies\n\nExamine for damaged and worn shades, cords\nand tapes; defective springs or mechanisms; broken or missing parts; torn, dirty or missing drapes. 4. Space heating equipment\n\nIf heating is by means of radiators or\nconvectors, check for cleanliness and freedom from lint and dust; see that\nvalves and traps are operative and do not leak water and that convector covers\nare properly anchored. 5. Plumbing fixtures & related hardware\n\nLook for any breakage or chipping; easy and\ncomplete closing of faucets leakage; proper level of filling in water closet\ntanks or time flush valves on commodes and urinals; loose cracked or broken\ntoilet seats. 6. Electrical\nwiring\n\nInspect fuses/circuit breakers to see that\nthey have not been tampered with and are not oversize or overloaded. Check all\nceiling lights, switches and outlets for broken cover plates, loose\nconnections, missing screws, etc. Inspect occupant-owned appliances and lamps\nfor any frayed cords, broken plugs, or other potentially hazardous elements, i.e., cords running under carpets or across floor surface. 7. Hardware (Interior doors) Loose and\nmissing lock and passage sets, hinges, panic bar hardware, door silencers, stops are the most overlooked items. The improper chocking open of doors, removal of pins, stops, silencers, screws and strike plates can cause safety\nhazards and failure of hardware. Loose or missing hardware should be reported\nimmediately. VELEVATORS AND ESCALATORS\nA. Elevators\n\nElevator inspection and maintenance\nrequires the services of highly-trained mechanics; control systems of the new\nautomatic elevators require the services of electronic technicians. The\ncondition of floors and sills at landing should be given particular attention, with shafts and pits to be inspected monthly, by the maintenance contractor or\na responsible employee. Accumulation of lint on rails, guides or car frame\nshould be removed at once since it constitutes a fire hazard. The same concerns\nhold for the accumulation of debris in the pits and behind hoistway doors. All\nelevator cars should be checked periodically to verify that required inspection\ncertificates are posted and up to date. B. Escalators\n\nEscalators should be checked at the\nbeginning of each day to determine that travel directions are correct and that\nno hazardous conditions exist. Particular attention should be given to the\nremovable floor panels over the machinery compartments to be sure that no\ntripping hazards exist. Escalators should be checked and cleaned\neach day with particular attention given to handrails, combplates, treads and\nrisers. A record of accidents which occur on\nescalators should be maintained. These records should contain all available\ndetails pertaining to possible cause and brought to the attention of the\nescalator manufacturer on a regular basis. A review of accident records may\nreveal a pattern indicating a need for modification in design or\noperations. A. Inspection\nand Cleaning of Ducts\n\nInspection of the ducts should be made in\nthe spring and fall. Cooling and heating coils should be cleaned. B. Fresh Air Intake\n\nThe intakes should be checked at time of\nduct inspection. Accumulated debris should be removed immediately. C. Filters\n\nFilters should be inspected, replaced or\ncleaned in accordance with manufacturers recommendations. The controls for the HVAC, heating and\ncooling systems should be inspected to ensure proper operation at the beginning\nof the heating and cooling seasons. The controls for the HVAC, heating and\ncooling systems should be calibrated by a qualified professional yearly. Repairs and replacement of all controls\nshould be done by qualified technical staff. D. Fire Doors and Dampers\n\nThese should be examined at a minimum of\nonce a year. E. Maintenance\nof Machine Rooms\n\nKeep machine and equipment rooms painted, clean and free of foreign objects. F. Power Distribution-Electrical Systems\n\nAll electrical installations must be made\nin compliance with the National Electrical Code or state and local codes, where\napplicable. G. Fans and Fan\n\nMotors\n\nFans and fan motors should be inspected at\nleast quarterly and cleaned and lubricated in accordance with the\nmanufacturer's instructions. H. Lighting Maintenance\n\nLamps (fluorescent and incandescent) should\nbe cleaned and replaced on a regular basis. Regular periodic inspections should be\ncarried out to ascertain if any defective or unsafe conditions exist; including, special attention to exterior illumination of buildings, entrance\nways, walks and parking areas. Particular attention should be given to\nutilizing energy saving fixtures and relamping products. I. Emergency Lighting and Power System\n\nThe emergency lighting and power system is\ninstalled to prevent panic and provide maintenance or security in the event of\nconventional power failure. Emergency systems must be completely dependable by\nfrequent testing. J. Fire\n\nProtection\n\nScheduled periodic inspections must be made\nin order to test fire protection equipment. The frequency of these inspections\nwill generally be regulated by either local fire regulations or codes or the\nrequirements of the National Fire Protection and American Insurance\n\nAssociation, whichever is more stringent. Visual inspection of standpipes, hoses, smoke detectors, sprinkler systems, fire extinguishers and other equipment\nshould be made to assure that they are being maintained, serviced and properly\nrecorded on a timely basis. Potential or actual fire hazards should be\nreported as soon as they are discovered. A. Government Owned Property\n\nCertain equipment maintenance and building\nservices are furnished to the court by private vendors who have contracts with\nthe municipality. It is the responsibility of the municipality to see that\nprearranged schedules for performance of these services are properly observed\nand that all work is satisfactorily completed with as little interruption to\ncourt processes as possible. Special attention should be given to the\ncareful wording of the performance specifications, the areas of responsibility\nand the required examination frequency schedule. The contractor should specify\nin the contract the type of staffing to be used for the work as well as the\nextent and method of their supervision. A schedule of costs on a unit basis for\nany additional services which may be required should be furnished by the\ncontractor. The quality of the materials and equipment to be used on the work\nshould be specified. The cost, method of payment and notice of termination of\nthe agreement should be precisely defined. Localities should have contract compliance\nand documentation procedures in place to monitor the level of performance, the\nquality of achievements, safety and other relevant factors. B. Leased Space - Privately Owned Property\n\nThe following should be incorporated into\nleases providing space to the Unified Court System: 1. The custodial cleaning frequency standards\nas established by the Unified Court System should appear in their\nentirety. 2. The method of\nperforming the tasks should be described carefully. 3. The nature of the chemicals and materials\nto be used or not used should be specified. 4. The nature of the staff should be\ncontrolled due to the sensitivity and security factors of the court system, i.e.: The contractor shall submit a master\nemployee roster to the local court administrator. If there are any changes in\nthe roster, the contractor will be responsible to submit an up-dated roster\nimmediately. Each and every employee of the contractor\nwill be required to prominently display an identification badge at all times\nwhile on court premises. The local court administrator has the right\nto reject and bar from the facility any employee hired by the\ncontractor. A full time supervisor will be at the\nfacility during the hours custodial work is being performed. 5. The provider is to schedule the starting\ntime of air conditioning and heating equipment to maintain a proper working and\nenergy efficient environment. 6. In\nthe event any repair is found to be necessary, the building manager is to\napprise the court in writing. The work should be progressed in stages and in\nsuch manner as to not interfere with the functioning of the courts and with the\nutmost regard for the safety and convenience of its personnel and the general\npublic. 7. Replacement of all\nburned out lamps and starters shall be made promptly on call from the\ncourt. 8. Repairs should be\ncompleted within a specified period of time. C. Contractor - Failure to Perform\nA penalty clause for the contractor's\nfailure to perform the work should be specific as to the court's rights, e.g. The contractor agrees that in the event any\nof the services provided for under the terms of this contract, should in any\nway be omitted or unsatisfactorily performed by the contractor and/or his\nemployees, the court shall so notify the municipality and the contractor in\nwriting of the deficient services for immediate correction. In the event the\ncontractor does not correct the deficient services after receipt of the written\nnotice to correct, the Office of Court Administration (OCA) shall request that\nthe municipality deduct a percentage, based on the work not performed or\nperformed unsatisfactorily as determined by the provider, from the voucher for\ntheir services rendered for that contract period. If the contractor continues\nto omit contracted services and or performs unsatisfactorily, then the court\nshall notify the municipality and the contractor to correct the neglected or\ndeficient services within five (5) days from the date of the notice. Should the\ncontractor fail to correct the deficient services, OCA will then arrange with\nthe municipality for the work to be done by another contractor and the cost of\nsuch work shall be deducted from any monies due or may become due to the\ncontractor. A. Water\n\nWater should be potable for drinking\npurposes and pure from chemical or metallic elements that are injurious to\nhuman health, equipment and plumbing system. Where practicable, localities should\ninstall separate water meters for court facilities which will allow for cost\nidentification and establishment of programs for conservation of water. B. Electricity\n\nLighting fixtures and ceilings should be\nclean to allow for maximum light reflection. Consideration should be given to providing\nseparate independent light switches for certain rooms and areas which may\nresult in large electrical savings. A study should be conducted to evaluate the\nefficiency of older fixtures. Maximum use should be made of natural light\nto help reduce the need for additional electrical illumination. Windows should\nbe regularly cleaned to allow for maximum penetration of natural light to save\nelectrical energy. Localities should consider using the Power\n\nAuthority of the State of New York (PASNY) which offers reduced rates to local\ngovernment. C. Heating and\n\nAir Conditioning - Climate Control\n\nHeating and air conditioning is an\nimportant element in the proper operation of a building by providing a\nreasonable comfort level of environment to users. In addition to electricity, some facilities use gas or oil for heating which also represents a major cost\nfactor in the operation of facilities. Energy surveys of buildings should be\nconducted to identify loss of heated or cooled air and to determine corrective\nactions. Old leaking windows and doors, broken panes, loose caulking, etc. should be repaired. Municipalities should consider the\npossibility of installing separate meters or oil tanks to enable identification\nof costs related only to court facilities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
