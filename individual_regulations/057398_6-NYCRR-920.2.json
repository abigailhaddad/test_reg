  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 920.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In Table I an item number is assigned consecutively to\neach specifically designated waters or portion thereof. (b) Waters index number, as\nappearing in Table I, shall mean that number or abbreviation assigned to any\ndesignated waters or portion thereof for the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering or index system used to\nidentify specific waters of New York State was adapted from that used by the\n\nNew York State Conservation Department in its biological survey series of\nreports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a drainage area, such\nas a river, large lake, bay or sound are usually referred to by name or an\nabbreviation. Tributaries of primary river waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Tributaries of primary lake, bay or sound\nwaters are consecutively numbered in a clockwise order from a defined point, usually the outlet of the primary waters. Subtributaries are numbered as\nencountered along the tributary proceeding from its mouth to the source, and in\nlike manner all of its other stream courses are so numbered. Ponds and lakes\nare numbered in the order they are encountered within the system. Tributaries\nof such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing\nclockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. The numbers\nassigned to such lakes and ponds are prefixed by the letter P. When isolated\nlakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for\nconvenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any waters to\nwhich no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the waters\nunder consideration by the New York State Conservation Department in its\n\nBiological Survey of the Lower Hudson Watershed\nand\n\nBiological Survey of the Fresh Waters of Long Island\nin 1936\nand 1938, respectively, and has been closely followed in connection with the\nnumerical identification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on the older maps employed by the Conservation Department at\nthe time of its 1936 and 1938 surveys but not shown on later editions of maps\nreproduced herein. Conversely, streams, lakes and ponds not shown on the older\nmaps but appearing on the newer maps are designated by suffix letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to\nthe identification of the designated waters may be outlined as follows: There\nare several primary indices used to identify the designated waters. Those\nwaters that drain Moriches Bay proper are identified by waters index numbers\nprefixed by the abbreviation MB. Waters draining Narrow Bay proper are\nidentified by waters index numbers prefixed by the abbreviation NB. Waters of\n\nTuthill Cove, Hart's Cove, Seatuck Cove, Speonk Cove and Beaverdam Cove are\nidentified by TC, HC, SC, SPC and BC, respectively, prefixing the waters index\nnumbers. (4)\n\nThe following table\nwill illustrate how the designated waters may be identified through the use of\nthe waters index system: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\nNB-1, NB-2\n\nNarrow Bay\n\nPrimary waters identified by an abbreviation. NB-2-176\n\nPattersquash Creek\n\nThe 176th stream encountered on Long Island\nproceeding in a clockwise direction around the island from Fort Hamilton (The\n\nNarrows). MB-1, MB-2 MB-3, MB-4, MB-5, MB-6\n\nMoriches Bay\n\nPrimary waters identified by an abbreviation. MB-1-174\n\nForge River\n\nThe 174th stream encountered on Long Island\nproceeding in a clockwise direction around the island from Fort Hamilton (The\n\nNarrows). MB-1-174-2\n\nOld Neck Creek\n\nThe second tributary entering the Forge River above\nthe mouth. MB-1-174-P 850\n\nWest Pond\n\nThe 850th pond or lake encountered in the\nbiological survey area of the Atlantic Ocean - Long Island Sound\nwatershed. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib., and\nsubtribs., indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries, respectively, shall mean any\nstream, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other stream, pond or other body of surface water; where no tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated\nwaters shall include only the stream, pond or other body of water referenced by\nsuch waters index number; where a tributary, tributaries, subtributary or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, pond or other body of water\nreferenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and subtributaries\nthereof, which are shown on the reference maps, excluding numbered ponds, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name, as appearing in\n\nTable I, shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\nknown and which name may appear on the reference maps. In cases of specifically\ndesignated waters which have no name, the named waters to which the unnamed\nwaters are tributary are identified as far as possible. (e) Description. The column headed \"Description\" contains designations of\nsegments or sections of waters under consideration to which a particular\nassignment of a class and standards shall apply. Also included in this column\nis any useful information pertinent to the classification or standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as appearing in Table I, means map reference number and indicates one or more\nof the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on\nwhich the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown. (1)\n\nThe following maps were produced from\noriginal maps which may be procured through the Washington Distribution\n\nSection, Geological Survey, Silver Spring, Maryland. Map Ref. No. Name of\nquadrangle\n\nEdition\n\nPublished by\n1\n\nBellport\n1947\nU.S. Geological Survey\n2\n\nMoriches\n1947\nU.S. Geological Survey\n3\n\nEastport\n1947\nU.S. Geological Survey\n(2)\n\nThe above-mentioned maps have been\nconsolidated in section\n920.6, infra, and\nare hereinafter known as Map 2. (g) Class, as appearing in\n\nTable I and denoted by the letters B, C, SA, SC and SD opposite each\nspecifically designated waters, shall mean Class B, C, SA, SC and SD, as the\ncase may be, as set forth in Part 701, supra. (h) Standards, as appearing\nin Table I and denoted by the letters B, C, SA, SC and SD opposite each\nspecifically designated waters, shall mean the quality standards established\nfor Class B, C, SA, SC and SD, as the case may be, as set forth in Part 701, supra. The symbol (T) appearing after any class designation\nshall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and that the dissolved\noxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol (TS)\nafter any class designation shall mean that the designated waters are suitable\nfor trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen specification for trout\nspawning waters shall apply thereto. (i) The term\ntrout\nas used\nin this Part means any fish in the following genera: Coregonus, Oncorhynchus, Prosopium, Salmo, Salvelinus\nand\n\nThymallus. (j) The\n\nMoriches Bay drainage basin shall be deemed to include the following areas: (1)\nthat portion of the Atlantic Ocean within\nthe boundaries of New York State extending from a line passing due south\nthrough Potunk Point to a line passing due south through Smith Point; (2)\nall of Moriches Bay and Narrow Bay as\ndefined in Table I included herein; and\n(3)\nall land and water areas which are\ndirectly or indirectly tributary to Moriches Bay or Narrow Bay, except those\ntidal salt waters which are tributary to said bays easterly of Potunk Point and\nwesterly of Smith Point. (k) Unless otherwise expressly defined in\n\nTable I, the mouth of any stream or estuary shall be considered to be\nrepresented by a continuation of the shoreline of the bay, cove, river, estuary\nor creek to which such stream or estuary is tributary across the channel axis\nof such tributary stream or estuary. (l) All streams, ponds, estuaries or other\nbodies of water which appear as lines, to indicate natural waters, on the\nreference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated in Table I, shall be assigned the same classes and standards of quality and purity as the\nspecifically designated waters to which they are directly tributary. (m) All streams, ponds, estuaries or other\nbodies of water which are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be\nassigned to Class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except\nthat any continuous flowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference\nmaps shall have the same classification and assigned standards as the waters to\nwhich it is directly tributary; or, if they be tidal salt waters, such waters\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be assigned to Class SD, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standards as the waters to which it is\ndirectly tributary.
