  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 118.1 - New York taxable income of a resident estate or trust\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 618\n(a) General. (1)\n\nThe New York taxable income of a resident\nestate or trust is its Federal taxable income, as defined by the Internal\n\nRevenue Code for the taxable year, subject to the modifications explained in\nsections\n118.2\nthrough\n118.5\nof this Part. The New York taxable income of a resident estate or trust is\nsubject to the ordinary tax at the rates prescribed in section\n602\nof the\n\nTax Law, plus a tax surcharge at the rate and for the years in effect\nprescribed in section 601-B of the Tax Law. For taxable years beginning on or\nafter January 1, 1978, if a resident estate or trust has New York personal\nservice taxable income and otherwise meets the requirements of section 603-A of\nthe Tax Law, such estate or trust must compute its maximum tax in accordance\nwith the provisions of such section in lieu of computing the ordinary tax on\nits New York taxable income. The New York State minimum taxable income of a\nresident estate or trust is determined as described in Part 122 of this\n\nArticle, the New York State separate tax of a resident estate or trust on the\ntermination of a qualified higher education fund is determined as described in\nsection 601-D of the Tax Law and the New York State separate tax of a resident\nestate or trust on the ordinary income portion of lump sum distributions is\ndetermined as described in Part 124 of this Article. (2)\n\nSee sections\n106.1, 106.4, 106.6\nand\n106.8\nof this Title and Parts 120 and 121 of this Article for credits against the\ntaxes imposed on a resident estate or trust. (3)\n\nThe definition of a resident estate or\ntrust is contained in section\n105.23\nof this Title. For the definition of a nonresident estate or trust, see section\n105.24 of this Title. The New York taxable income of a nonresident estate or\ntrust is determined as described in Part 138 of this Title. (b) The Federal taxable income of\na resident estate or trust does not include the amounts distributable or\nproperly paid or credited to its beneficiaries. Consequently, the New York\ntaxable income of a resident estate or trust does not include these amounts\nsince such amounts are taxable to the beneficiaries as explained in sections\n118.4\nof this Part and Part 119 of this Article. (c) It should be noted that the New York\n\nState personal income tax return filed by an executor or administrator, covering the period ending with the date of a decedent's death, is a New York\n\nState personal income tax return for the decedent himself, not a New York State\nfiduciary return for the estate. If the decedent was a resident of New York\n\nState, his New York taxable income for the period ending with his death is\ncomputed in the same way as the New York taxable income of any other resident\nindividual (see Part 111 of this Article; see also section\n151.11\nof this Subchapter as to New York State personal income tax returns for\ndecedents). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n118.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
