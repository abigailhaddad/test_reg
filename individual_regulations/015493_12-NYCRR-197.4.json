(b) The commissioner\nmay revoke, suspend or refuse to issue or renew a certificate or permit: (1)\nif he finds that the applicant or permit\nor certificate holder has violated the Labor Law, or has been convicted of any\ncrime or offense related to his activity under the certificate or permit, or\ninvolves an unreasonable risk to the safety or welfare of employees or the\npublic, or has made misrepresentations or false statements in his application, or has given false or misleading information to workers who are recruited or\nhired, or is not a person of good character or responsibility, or is not in\nfact the real party in interest in any such application or certificate of\nregistration; (2)\nupon notification\nby the State Department of Health that the applicant or permit or certificate\nholder has failed to comply with the State sanitary code for migrant labor\ncamps (10 NYCRR Part\n15\n). (c) The commissioner shall not refuse to\nissue, nor shall he suspend or revoke, a certificate or permit unless an\nopportunity to be heard, as provided in section\n197.11\nof this Part, has been\ngiven to the applicant or permit or certificate holder; provided, however, that\npending the determination of such hearing the commissioner may temporarily\nsuspend a certificate or permit if, in his opinion, its suspension for such\nperiod is necessary to effectuate the purposes of the Labor Law and this\n\nPart. (d) The commissioner or his\nauthorized representative shall have the right to inquire, by investigation or\nhearing, into the circumstances surrounding the use of the permit or\ncertificate in order that a determination can be made as to the issuance or\ndenial of a certificate or permit. The investigation and hearing may include\nbut shall not be limited to questioning of the applicant and other probable\nparties of interest. Failure by the applicant to fully disclose other parties\nof interest shall be sufficient cause for denial of the application. (e) If a certificate or permit is denied or\nrevoked, the applicant may not submit an application for a new certificate or\npermit until 24 months have elapsed from the date of the denial or revocation, provided that, for good cause shown, the commissioner may reduce the\ndisqualification period. A previously denied applicant must submit any new\napplication at least 90 days prior to the date when the applicant plans to\nperform services in New York State. (f) A farm labor contractor certificate, migrant labor certificate or farm labor camp commissary permit shall be valid\nfrom the date of issuance until the following March 30th, unless earlier\nrevoked as provided in subdivision (b) of this section.
