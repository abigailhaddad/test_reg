If any existing structures or improvements on the site are to\nbe removed by the owners or others, the buildings or improvements must be so\ndesignated on the plat. Any discrepancies between the survey and the recorded legal\ndescription shall be reconciled or explained. The plat shall indicate: The courses and distances of property lines. Dimensions and location of any buildings, structures, easements, rights-of-way or encroachments on the site. Details of party walls, or walls and foundations adjacent to\nthe lot lines. The position, dimensions and elevations of all cellars, excavations, wells, back-filled areas, etc., and the elevation of any water\ntherein. All trees which may be affected by the building\noperations.

Each sample container shall be\nidentified as to the boring and elevations at which taken and the labels\ninitialed by the engineer making the soil investigation. The following information shall be noted on the plat: Thickness, consistency, character, and estimated safe bearing\nvalue of the various strata encountered in each pit or boring. Amount and elevation of ground water encountered in each pit or\nboring. Its probable variation with the seasons and effect on the\nsubsoil. The elevation of rock, if known, and the probability of\nencountering quicksand. Average depth of frost effect below surface of ground. High and low water levels of nearby bodies of water affecting\nthe ground water level. The probability of freshets overrunning the site.
