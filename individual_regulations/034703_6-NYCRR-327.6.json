(2)\n\nPurpose. Authorized for algae\ncontrol. (3)\n\nPeriods of treatment. Generally, May to September. Treatments later than Labor Day will require\nspecial authorization. (4)\n\nDosage. Not to exceed 0.3 ppm CuSO\n4\n[*]5H\n2\nO in the upper six feet of depth in ponds or lakes with\nover two acres of surface area. Not to exceed 0.3 ppm CuSO\n4\n[*]5H\n2\nO in the total volume of\nponds with two acres or less of surface area. The above is based on water of\naverage alkalinity for the State (100 ppm or over). In softer waters, a reduced\ndosage may be required. (5)\n\nMethod\nof application. No permit shall be issued for the direct broadcasting of\ncrystals or \"snow\". Copper sulfate should be applied as a liquid using spray\nequipment or as a solid placed in a burlap bag dragged behind a boat. (6)\n\nRepeat treatments. Shall not be\nauthorized at any interval of less than two weeks. (7)\n\nWater-use restrictions. Bathing and\nlivestock watering shall be prohibited for at least 24 hours following a\ntreatment. (b) Diquat\nfor submerged and emergent vegetation. (1)\n\nActive ingredient. Diquat dibromide--6, 7-dihydrodipyrido (1, 2-a:2), (1-\nc)-pyrazidinium dibromide. (2)\n\nPurpose. Authorized for the control of emergent plants having leafy growth\nlying flat on the water surface and for the control of aquatic plants growing\nbeneath the water surface. (3)\n\nPeriods of treatment. Generally spring and late summer. Treatment after\n\nSeptember 1 may require special authorization. (4)\n\nDosage. Maximum application is two\ngallons (35.3%A.I) per surface acre of water. (5)\n\nTreatment area. Shall not extend beyond\n200 feet from shore or beyond a maximum depth of six feet, whichever gives the\ngreatest distance from shore. (6)\n\nRepeat treatments. No permit shall be issued for a second treatment within the\nsame season. (7)\n\nWater-use\nrestrictions. Treated waters shall not be used for irrigation, bathing, fishing, or by man or animals for drinking or food processing for a period of\n14 days after treatment. (c) Low-volatile esters, salts and amines of\n2,4-D for emergent vegetation. (1)\n\nActive\ningredient. Calculated as 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid. (2)\n\nPurpose. Authorized only for the control\nof emergent plants having a large part of their leafy growth projecting above\nor lying flat on the water surface. (3)\n\nPeriods of treatment. Restricted to late\nspring or early summer when the chemical is most effective. (4)\n\nDosage. Use of chemical solutions for\ndosage of up to eight pounds active ingredient per acre may be permitted in the\ntreatment of dense stands. Use of pellets for subsurface application requires\nspecial authorization. (5)\n\nTreatment area. Shall not extend beyond 200 feet from shore or beyond a maximum\ndepth of six feet, whichever gives the greater distance from shore. (6)\n\nWater use restrictions. Use of the waters\nfor irrigation shall be prohibited for a period sufficient to permit the decay\nof the phytotoxicity. The treated waters and those waters affected by the\ntreatment shall not be used for other purposes during the treatment and for at\nleast 24 hours thereafter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
