  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 2052.4 - Selection of outside contractors\n\nState Regulations\n\nSelection of all outside contractors shall be made on a\ncompetitive basis, except in the following circumstances: (a) the total amount of the contract is not\nlikely to exceed $5,000; (b) the\npresident, or the responsible official after consultation with the president, shall have determined that (1) the need to obtain high quality services or\nservices having unique or extraordinary features or time requirements\nsubstantially outweighs possible cost savings from selection on a competitive\nbasis, or (2) the corporation has other cost control procedures to protect the\ncorporation from paying more for services than necessary; or\n(c) the board of directors otherwise\ndetermines that competition would be inappropriate. The foregoing shall not be construed to affect any\nrequirement for competitive bidding binding on the corporation under applicable\nlaw. Where selection is made on a competitive basis, the responsible officer\nshall request detailed proposals from at least three outside contractors known\nto have experience in the type of service to be performed. Where the total\nvalue of the contract is likely to exceed $10,000, the proposals shall be in\nwriting. Proposals shall be evaluated on the basis of all relevant factors such\nas the outside contractor's experience, reputation, technical qualifications, financial condition, past performance, size, quality and availability of staff, identity of supervisory personnel, possible conflicts of interest, proposed\nscope of work and proposed fee or commission. No single factor shall\nnecessarily be controlling and the outside contractor submitting the proposal\nwhich is most favorable on an overall basis shall be selected, except that the\npresident, or the responsible official, after consultation with the president, may reject any or all proposals if he considers such action in the best\ninterests of the corporation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n2052.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
