  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4043.8 - TCO2 blood gas testing program\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ncommission may obtain pre-race blood samples from horses for subsequent testing\nfor total carbon dioxide level (TCO2). The commission may also obtain post-race\nblood samples from horses for subsequent testing for TCO2, after a minimum\none-hour standing at rest period for the horse after such horse's race. It\nshall be a violation of this section where the horse's TCO2 level equals or\nexceeds 37 millimoles per liter or, for horses administered furosemide pursuant\nto section\n4043.2\n(b)(6)\nof\nthis Part during the four hours before the blood sample was taken, 39\nmillimoles per liter. (b) It shall\nbe an affirmative defense that the horse's physiologically natural TCO2 level\nwas not exceeded. To demonstrate natural TCO2, such horse's owner or trainer\nmust make a written request to the stewards, within three calendar days of\nreceiving notice of the horse's TCO2 test result, that the horse be held in\nguarded quarantine for this purpose. The racetrack operator shall make\navailable a three-day guarded quarantine for a time determined by the State\nsteward, at the sole expense of the requesting party, where blood samples shall\nbe periodically taken for subsequent testing by the commission. If the owner or\ntrainer properly arranges with the commission in advance, then samples shall\nalso be taken and sent for independent testing at another laboratory at the\nsole expense of the requesting party. During quarantine the horse shall not\nrace, but it may be exercised and trained at prescribed times that do not\ninterfere with monitoring, sampling, and testing the horse. After the\nquarantine, the State steward shall determine whether the horse's TCO2 level\nwas physiologically natural for it. The State steward may also require, at\nleast 45 days later, that the horse re-establish such horse's natural TCO2\nlevel with another guarded quarantine to be made available at the sole expense\nof the racetrack operator. (c) Any\nguarded quarantine provided by the racetrack operator shall ensure that, at a\nminimum: (1)\nsuch horse shall be under direct\nsurveillance by at least one guard at all times; (2)\naccess to the horse shall be restricted\nto licensed persons who are directly affiliated with such horse, track\nstewards, or employees of the New York State Gaming Commission, all of whom\nshall provide their respective track identification badge or commission-issued\nphoto identification card prior to entry; (3)\na written or electronic log of all\npersons who have had access to the horse shall be maintained by the guard, indicating the name and license number or track identification badge number of\nthe person, the date and time of the visit (including time in and out of the\nrestricted area), the nature and purpose of the visit, a description of any and\nall equipment, paraphernalia, tack, medications, or feed brought to the horse, and all activity observed by the guard during the visit; and\n(4)\nthe racetrack operator shall maintain\nsuch written or electronic logs of guarded quarantine activity for a minimum\nperiod of 90 days after the conclusion of the applicable guarded quarantine\nperiod. (d) The penalty\nfor violations of this section shall be not less than: (1)\nfor a first violation, a 60-day license\nsuspension and $1,000 fine; (2)\nfor\na second violation, a 75-day license suspension and $2,500 fine; and\n(3)\nfor additional violations, a one-year\nsuspension and $5,000 fine together with a referral to the commission for\nfurther action including a possible license revocation. Where independent evidence shows that the horse was\ntreated within 24 hours of such horse's race by means not permitted by section\n4043.2\nof this Part, however, every\nlicense suspension shall be for at least two years. Every suspension shall\ninclude denial of the privileges of the grounds. (e) For a violation of this section, a horse\nshall be disqualified, any purse monies shall be forfeited and redistributed\npursuant to section\n4043.5\nof this Part, the horse\nshall be subject to pre-race detention and shall be ineligible to race until it\ntests in compliance with this rule and tests negative for drugs.
