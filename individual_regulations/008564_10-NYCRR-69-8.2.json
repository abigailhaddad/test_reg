Tit. 10 §§ 69-8.2 - General requirements for infant hearing screening programs and responsibilities of the administrative officers or designees of facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each facility shall administer an infant hearing screening program, directly or by contract pursuant to section\n400.4\nof this Title, as required by this Part and as generally described in subdivision (b) of this section, except for those facilities identified in subdivision (c) of this section. (1)\n\nFacilities that establish a contract(s) with providers of infant hearing screening shall designate a staff member responsible for contract management and general oversight of the program. (2)\n\nContracts may be established for the conduct of inpatient and/or outpatient infant hearing screening. (3)\n\nContractors must be article 28 facilities or health care providers licensed under State Education Law and authorized under such law to perform infant hearing screening. (4)\n\nContractors shall have the capacity to meet general requirements for infant hearing screening programs as set forth in subdivision (b) of this section. (b) General requirements of an infant hearing screening program are: (1)\n\nThe conduct of a two-tier inpatient infant hearing screening prior to discharge from neonatal care for infants in the normal newborn nursery. Two-tier infant hearing screening consists of initial screening with OAE or ABR on both ears. Each ear must pass the OAE or ABR screening to be considered a \"pass.\" If the OAE or ABR screening is not passed in one or both ears, an ABR screening is performed on both ears. If the infant passes the ABR screening, the infant has ''passed'' the hearing screening. If one or both ears do not pass the ABR screening, the infant shall be referred for outpatient re-screening and/or diagnostic audiological evaluation. (2)\n\nThe conduct of newborn hearing screening using ABR for infants who have received care in a neonatal intensive care unit (\"NICU\"), for the initial and any secondary screening. Infants cared for in the NICU who do not pass the inpatient ABR screening shall be referred to a provider licensed under State Education Law and authorized to provide infant hearing screening and diagnostic audiological evaluations for rescreening, and, if indicated, given a comprehensive audiological evaluation including diagnostic ABR. (3)\n\nCommunication of results of infant hearing screenings to parents by designated personnel, including provision of written materials supplied by the department. (4)\n\nThe conduct of follow-up infant hearing screening or provision of referrals to obtain follow-up screening on an outpatient basis for those infants who fail or do not receive infant hearing screening prior to discharge from the facility. On an annual basis, facilities shall notify the department whether the facility will conduct follow-up infant hearing screening or provide referrals for infants to obtain such screening from another facility or provider licensed under State Education Law and authorized to provide infant hearing screening. (5)\n\nReferral of infants who are suspected of having a hearing loss as defined in this part to the Early Intervention Program for appropriate evaluation and early intervention services pursuant to section\n69-4.3\nof this title including, but not limited to: (i) providing a general explanation of the Early Intervention Program and the purpose of referral and the parents' right to object to the referral; (ii)\nensuring confidentiality of referral information transmitted; and\n(iii)\ntransmitting of personally identifying information as necessary to ensure follow-up; (6)\n\nThe reporting of aggregate data on infant hearing screenings to the department upon department request, in a format and frequency prescribed by the commissioner. (7)\n\nThe establishment of facility quality assurance protocols as necessary pursuant to section\n405.6\nof this Title to determine and evaluate the effectiveness of the program in ensuring all infants are screened for hearing loss. (8)\n\nIndividual infant data must be reported or updated through the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention - Information System (EHDI-IS) or any successor system whenever new screening results are obtained. (c) Facilities with 400 or fewer births annually, based on a three-year rolling average, may provide referrals for infants to receive hearing screening from an article 28 facility or a provider licensed under State Education Law and authorized under such law to perform infant hearing screening, or medical assistants trained and deemed capable by an infant hearing screening program manager, as defined in section\n69-8.3\nof this Subpart, to perform basic hearing tests which do not require exercise of clinical decision-making. (1)\n\nSuch referrals shall include a prescription issued by the facility for infants to receive hearing screening, including a request for results of the screening to be returned to that facility. (2)\n\nSuch facilities shall submit screening results returned to the facility by the outpatient provider as required by the department to determine the effectiveness of referral procedures in ensuring infants are screened for hearing loss.
