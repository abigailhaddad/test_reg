  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 515.4 - The role of the commander in the military justice system\n\nState Regulations\n(See FM 27-1, Legal Guide for Commanders.)\n(a) All commanders are responsible for the\nleadership, military order and discipline of their troops in order to perform\ntheir mission. (b) Discipline has\nbeen defined by the Powell Report on the Uniform Code of Military Justice as \"a\nstate of mind which leads to a willingness to obey an order no matter how\nunpleasant the task to be performed. This is not generally characteristic of a\ncivilian community. Development of this state of mind among soldiers or sailors\nis a command responsibility and a necessity. In the development of discipline, correction of individuals is indispensable; in correction, fairness or justice\nis indispensable. Thus, it is a mistake to talk of balancing discipline and\njustice--the two are inseparable\". (c) Since most New York State troops are not\nperforming duty on a full-time basis, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52\nweeks a year like their counterparts in the active services, discipline among\nstate troops sometimes becomes more lax than that of the active\nforces. (d) While this may be\nappropriate under some circumstances, it is not to be encouraged. If the state\ntroops which are part of the \"ready reserve\" of the active forces are to\nsuccessfully perform their mission upon an activation into the regular active\nforces, discipline must be maintained at all times. If troops maintain\ndiscipline at all times, the adjustment or assimilation phase that all troops\nmust undergo during an activation will be shortened, thus alleviating some of\nthe \"culture shock\" the troops may initially experience. (e) In order to maintain military order and\ndiscipline, commanders must have a working understanding of the military\njustice system and learn to utilize the same. A commander who does not know how\nto use the military justice system on inactive duty will not miraculously know\nhow to immediately use it upon an activation. Therefore, not only is it\nimperative to use the military justice system to maintain good order and\ndiscipline within a unit, it is part of the military training not only of the\ncommander, but of his troops.
