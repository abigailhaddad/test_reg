Tit. 14 § 605.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Office for\n\nPeople With Developmental Disabilities' (OPWDD) (see glossary) Youth\n\nOpportunity Program (YOP) is a part-time work experience and career oriented\ntraining program for secondary school youth who meet the definition of\neconomically disadvantaged as stated in Higher Education Opportunity Program\n(HEOP) as described in Title 9 NYCRR Subpart\n27-1.1(b)(1), Table II for\napplicants entering the YOP program between July 1, 1993 and June 30, 1994, and\n\nTable III for those applicants entering the program on or after July 1, 1994. The primary goal is to motivate youngsters at risk of dropping out to remain in\nschool until they graduate. In addition, the program encourages students to\npursue post-secondary education. The program is designed to provide the\ntraining and placement for students, who will gain work experience with persons\nwith developmental disabilities. In some instances, due to the partnership\nbetween OPWDD and the Office of Mental Health (OMH) (see glossary), students\nwill gain work experience with persons with mental illness. (b) YOP also seeks to expose students to\noccupations within the health and human service fields, particularly in direct\ncare and clinical areas. Most of these occupations are classified as\n\"Occupations in Need\". This designation means that these are critical\noccupations that OPWDD has currently, and may have difficulty filling in the\nfuture. These goals require a continuous commitment to provide work experiences\nand counseling to the youths in the program. (c) The goals of the Youth Opportunity\n\nProgram are to: (1)\nserve disadvantaged youth\nat high risk of school dropout; (2)\nencourage high school completion; (3)\nencourage post high school\neducation; (4)\nprovide students\nwith a supervised work experience; (5)\ninitiate and nurture interest in\nproviding services to persons with developmental disabilities; (6)\nassist in the transition to regular, full-time employment; and\n(7)\npromote personal growth.
