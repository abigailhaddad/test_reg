(3)\n\nIn situations where a certificate of\noccupancy reflecting currently applied occupancy group designation for an\nenriched housing program or an adult home is not available or attainable from\nthe local authority having jurisdiction, but there is a valid certificate of\noccupancy in place for the building, the department will accept an architect's\nor engineer's letter of certification signed by a registered architect (RA) or\nprofessional engineer (PE) certifying that the building under consideration\nmeets all applicable codes, rules and regulations.

(c) New structures. (1)\nA new building\nconstructed as an ALR, special needs ALR or enhanced ALR shall meet the\napplicable structural and environmental requirements currently in effect for a\nnew enriched housing program or an adult home. A new building shall be any\nbuilding for which construction is commenced after the date of adoption of this\n\nPart.
