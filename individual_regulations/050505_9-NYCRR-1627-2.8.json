Verification\nof reported decreases must be obtained before rent is decreased. However, where\ntenants reports an increase in income which results in a rent increase, the\nrent will be increased on the effective date of rent change (see Definitions, §\n1627-2.3\n) without waiting for the\nreturn of the requested verification. In the event the verification shows a\nhigher or lower increase than reported by tenant, the rent will be further\nadjusted. (b) Tenants are required\nto cooperate fully in obtaining verification of income. (See also §\n1627-2.11\nbelow.)\n(c) Following are various methods of\nverification. Note that more than one method may be needed to obtain acceptable\nverification. (1)\n\nEmployer's statement\ncompletely filled out and signed by officer or responsible party of firm. If\nseveral tenants are employed by same firm, a request for verification of a\nconsolidated listing of tenants may be made. (2)\n\nPhotostat of income tax report on file\nwith Internal Revenue Service and supported by books of account, pay stubs, etc. (3)\nW-2 form may be used as\nsupplemental verification of current pay envelopes, pay stubs and employer's\nstatement. It is not always adequate by itself as it indicates wages received\nduring the past year from only one employer, whereas, in some cases, wages may\nhave been received from more than one employer. (4)\n\nCurrent pay stubs and pay envelopes if\nthey identify recipient clearly and provide a basis for determining rate of\npay. Tenants should be advised to retain all such stubs or envelopes.

(d) The Social Security Board maintains\nrecords of earnings reported to board for all employees having social security\nnumbers. However, requests for social security statements are to be submitted\nonly where earnings cannot otherwise be conclusively verified, such as tenants\nwho claim not to have worked, or are employed by relatives. Request for social\nsecurity statement must be submitted on Social Security Administration form\nOAR-7004 and must show tenant's home address as return address. It is\nresponsibility of tenant to deliver report to authority office upon receipt. Social security records are usually not available until six months after\ncompletion of quarter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
