  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.18 - Accounting for property, plant and equipment\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1380 ]\n(a) Classification of fixed asset\nexpenditures. [ 1381 ] Property, Plant and Equipment and related\nliabilities must be recorded in the Unrestricted Fund, since segregation in a\nseparate fund would imply the existence of restrictions on the use of the\nasset. Cost of construction in progress and related liabilities must be\nrecorded in the Unrestricted Fund as incurred except for assets and liabilities\nrelated to certain debt agreements. (b) Basis of valuation. [ 1382 ]\n(1)\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment must be reported on the basis of cost. Cost shall\nbe defined as historical cost or fair market value at the date of gift of\ndonated property. (2)\n\nProperty, Plant and Equipment must be reported on the basis of the historical cost\nincurred by the present owner in acquiring the asset under a bona fide sale. The historical cost shall not exceed the lower of current reproduction cost\nadjusted for straight-line depreciation or fair market value at the time of\npurchase. See section 104.10 of HIM-15. Cost is defined as historical cost or\nfair market value of donated property on the date of acquisition. (c) Accounting\ncontrol. [ 1383 ]\n(1)\n\nTo\nmaintain accounting control over capital assets of the hospital, a plant asset\nledger should be maintained as part of the general accounting records. Some\nitems of equipment should be treated as individual units within the plant\nledger when their individuality and unit cost justify such treatment. Other\nitems of equipment, if they are similar and are used in a single cost center, may be grouped together and treated as a single unit within the\nledger. (2)\n\nAll equipment purchased\non or after the first day of a hospital's first accounting period beginning\nafter the effective date of this manual, and all equipment purchased prior to\nsuch date where the necessary records have been maintained, must be segregated\nin the plant ledger record by cost center so that the cost of equipment and the\nrelated depreciation for each cost center is available. (d) Capitalization policy. [ 1384 ]\n(1)\n\nIf\na depreciable asset has at the time of its acquisition an estimated useful life\nof three or more years and an historical cost of at least $300, its cost must\nbe capitalized, and written off ratably over the estimated useful life of the\nasset. (2)\n\nIf a depreciable asset\nhas an historical cost of less than $300, or if the asset has a useful life of\nless than three years, its costs are recorded in the year it is acquired, subject to the provisions of writing off the cost of minor movable equipment. The hospital may, if it desires, establish a capitalization policy with lower\nminimum criteria but under no circumstances may the above criteria be exceeded. Alterations and improvements in excess of $300 which extend the life a minimum\nof three years or increase the productivity or efficiency of an asset, as\nopposed to repairs and maintenance which either restore the asset to or\nmaintain it at its normal or expected service life, must be capitalized and\ndepreciated over their expected useful lives, not to exceed the lives of the\nasset to which they are fixed. Normal repair and maintenance costs are to be\nreported as expense in the current accounting period. (3)\n\nFor cost reporting periods beginning\n\nJanuary 1, 1981 and thereafter, the historical cost limits will be adjusted to\n\"an historical cost of at least $500 or, if it is acquired in quantity, the\ncost of the quantity is at least $1,000\". The new $500 limit will also apply to\nalterations and improvements. All other principles cited above will continue in\nforce. (e) Minor\nequipment. [ 1385 ]\n(1)\n\nMinor equipment\nincludes such items as wastebaskets, bedpans, silverware, mops, buckets, etc. The general characteristics of this equipment\nare: (i) in general, no fixed location, and\nsubject to use by various cost centers within a hospital; (ii)\ncomparatively small in size and unit\ncost; (iii)\nsubject to inventory\ncontrol; (iv)\nfairly large quantity\nin use; and\n(v) generally, a useful\nlife of less than three years. (2)\n\nThere are two ways in which the cost of\nminor equipment may be reported: (i) The\noriginal cost of this equipment may be capitalized and not depreciated. Any\nreplacements to this base stock would be reported as operating expenses. The\namount of the base stock would be adjusted only if there were a significant\nchange in the size of the base stock. (ii)\n\nAll purchases of minor equipment may be\ncapitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. (3)\n\nOnce a hospital has applied\none of the methods, that method must be used consistently thereafter. (f) Interest\nexpense during period of construction. [ 1386 ] Frequently hospitals borrow funds to construct\nnew facilities or modernize and expand existing facilities. Interest costs\nincurred during the period of construction must be capitalized as a part of the\ncost of the construction. The period of construction is considered to extend to\nthe date the constructed asset is ready for use. When proceeds from a\nconstruction loan are invested and income is derived from such investments\nduring the construction period, the amount of interest expense to be\ncapitalized must be reduced by the amount of such income. (g) Depreciation policies. [ 1387 ]\n(1)\n\nDepreciation on plant assets used in the hospital's operations must be reported\nas an operating expense in the Unrestricted Fund. The straight line method of\ndepreciation must be used for all assets acquired after July 1970. The\nestimated useful life of a depreciable asset is its normal operating or service\nlife in terms of utility to the hospital. Some factors to be considered in\ndetermining useful life include normal wear and tear, obsolescence due to\nnormal economic and technological advances, climatic or local conditions and\nthe hospital's policy for repair and replacement. (2)\n\nIn selecting a proper useful life for\ncomputing depreciation, hospitals must utilize the most recent useful life\nguidelines published by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human\n\nServices or, if none exist, the most recent guidelines published by the\n\nInternal Revenue Service or the 1973 guidelines published by the American\n\nHospital Association. However, with the rapidly changing technology in\nhospitals, these recommendations may not be all-inclusive; in which case, the\nexpertise of the manufacturer, or other reliable sources, may be considered. Any changes in estimated useful lives must be properly documented by the\nhospital and approved by the hospital's Medicare intermediary. (3)\n\nFor reporting purposes each hospital must\nestablish, and follow consistently from year to year, a policy relative to the\namount of depreciation to be taken in the year of acquisition and disposal of\ndepreciable assets. Examples of acceptable policies are: (i) Computing first year depreciation based\nupon the portion of time the asset was in use during the year. That is, if a\ndepreciable asset was received and in use in the hospital for eight months in\nthe year of acquisition, two thirds of a full year's depreciation expense would\nbe recognized in that first year. (ii)\n\nRecording one half of the yearly\ndepreciation expense in the years of acquisition and disposal, regardless of\nthe date of acquisition or disposal. (4)\n\nDepreciation expense reported on\nbuildings, purchased or constructed, in the year of acquisition or disposal\nmust be based on the actual time during which the building was in use for\nhospital operations.
