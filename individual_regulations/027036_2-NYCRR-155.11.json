Tit. 2 § 155.11 - Distribution\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Unless a\nparticipant elects to be paid his or her service award in an optional\nactuarially equivalent form on the written application for distribution he or\nshe files with the administrator, the service award shall be paid to the\nparticipant in the form of a monthly payment straight life annuity. The amount\nof the monthly straight life annuity payment shall be 1/12 of the benefit\namount times the years of firefighting service credited to the participant as\nof the effective date of the commencement of payment of his or her service\naward. (b) Except as otherwise\nprovided in this section, a participant shall be entitled to apply for and\nreceive distribution of a service award only when the participant has attained\nthe entitlement age. A written application for distribution must be received by\nthe administrator from a participant before payments shall commence to the\nparticipant. The participant shall, on such written application, specify the\ndate as of which payment shall commence and shall select the form of payment of\nhis or her service award. The date as of which payment shall commence may be\nthe first day of any month commencing within the 90-day period immediately\nfollowing the date the written application is received by the administrator. A\nparticipant may file an application for distribution of his or her service\naward within the 90-day period immediately preceding the date on which he or\nshe will attain the entitlement age and specify the date as of which payment\nshall commence, which date shall be: (1)\nno\nearlier than the date of attainment of the entitlement age and acquiring a\nnonforfeitable right to a service award; and\n(2)\nno later than 90 days after the date of\nattainment of the entitlement age and acquiring a nonforfeitable right to a\nservice award. (c) The\ndate as of which payment of a service award shall commence shall not be on or\nbefore the last day of the first calendar year for which a participant\nqualified for a year of firefighting service credit. (d) The administrator shall approve an\napplication for distribution based on the terms of the sponsor's adoption or\ntransfer agreement, the records maintained by the administrator and, in the\ncase of disability or death, such additional records or information as the\nadministrator may require. The administrator, in its sole discretion, may\nrequire the sponsor, the appropriate volunteer fire company or volunteer fire\ndepartment or the participant to verify or supply any information the\nadministrator deems necessary to determine entitlement to distribution of a\nservice award. (e) The number and\ntypes of optional forms of payments of a service award available under a\n\nState-administered defined benefit volunteer firefighter service award program\nshall be at the sole discretion of the administrator subject to the approval of\nthe Comptroller. Program sponsors and volunteer fire companies or volunteer\nfire departments whose volunteer firefighters participate in a\n\nState-administered defined benefit volunteer firefighter service award program\nshall be promptly notified by the administrator in writing of any changes in\nthe optional forms of payment. Participants shall then be promptly notified\nabout such changes by the volunteer fire company or volunteer fire\ndepartment. (f) For determining the\npayments of a service award to a participant under an actuarially equivalent\nform of payment, the program actuary shall use the actuarial assumptions used\nto calculate the annual program costs payable by the sponsor during the\ncalendar year in which the payments of the service award to the participant or\nthe participant's beneficiary shall commence. (g) (1)\n\nIn\nthe event that a participant becomes totally and permanently disabled as\ncertified by the workers' compensation board or by any other competent\nauthority approved by the administrator, and the disability prevents the\nparticipant from pursuing his or her normal occupation, the participant shall\nbe entitled to apply for and receive distribution of his or her service award\nregardless of whether the participant has reached the entitlement age or\nacquired a nonforfeitable right to a service award. The participant may select\none of the optional forms of payment available under the State-administered\ndefined benefit volunteer firefighter service award program in case of\ndisability. The value of the service award shall be determined on the basis of\nthe years of volunteer firefighter service credited to the participant as of\nthe effective date of commencement of payment of the service award. The amount\nof payments shall be calculated so as to be actuarially equivalent to the\npresent value of the payments as if they commenced at the entitlement\nage. (2)\n\nIf a State-administered\ndefined benefit volunteer firefighter service award program includes an\noptional additional disability benefit that the sponsor has elected to provide\nfor a participant who becomes disabled during the course of service as an\nactive volunteer firefighter while actively engaged in providing a line of duty\nservice, then, in the event that a participant becomes totally and permanently\ndisabled as a result of such cause and such total and permanent disability is\ncertified by the workers' compensation board or by any other competent\nauthority approved by the administrator, the participant shall be entitled to\napply for and receive distribution of a service award equal to the amount of\nadditional benefits that the participant would have been entitled to had he or\nshe continued to earn years of firefighting service through his or her\nentitlement age if the rate of benefits being provided under the\n\nState-administered defined benefit service award program at the time of\ndisability continued to be provided through the entitlement age. (h) (1)\n\nIn the event of the death of a\nparticipant who has acquired a nonforfeitable right to a service award and who\nhas not previously received distribution of any portion of his or her service\naward, the beneficiary or beneficiaries designated by the participant or, if no\nbeneficiary has been designated, the participant's estate, shall be entitled to\napply for and receive distribution of the participant's service award. The\napplicant may select one of the optional forms of payment available under the\n\nState-administered defined benefit volunteer firefighter service award program\nin case of death. The value of the service award shall be determined on the\nbasis of the years of volunteer firefighter service credited to the participant\nas of the effective date of commencement of payment of the service award. The\namount of the payments shall be calculated so as to be actuarially equivalent\nto the present value of the payments as if they commenced at the entitlement\nage. (2)\n\nIf a State-administered\ndefined benefit volunteer firefighter service award program includes an\noptional additional death benefit that the sponsor has elected to provide for a\nparticipant who dies during the course of service as an active volunteer\nfirefighter while actively engaged in providing a line of duty service, then, in the event that a participant dies as a result of such cause, the beneficiary\nor beneficiaries designated by the participant shall be entitled to apply for\nand receive distribution of a service award in an amount equal to the amount of\nsuch optional additional death benefit.
