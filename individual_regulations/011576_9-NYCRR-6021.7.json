Tit. 9 § 6021.7 - Time limitations for completion of the course in police supervision\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every person\nappointed or promoted to a first-line supervisory position, on or after July 1, 1967, shall forfeit such position or promotion unless he or she has received, within one year from his or her appointment or promotion to said supervisory\nposition, a certificate of completion as the result of satisfactory completion\nof a supervisory course approved by the commissioner. (b) A police officer who because of exigent\ncircumstances is unable to complete a supervisory course within the one-year\nperiod as prescribed by subdivision (a) of this section, may apply through his\nor her employer for an extension of this period by the commissioner. Such\nrequests shall be made in writing and must describe the circumstances which\nnecessitate the application. Illustrative of exigent circumstances are: the\nofficer's inability to complete a supervisory course for health reasons or the\ntemporary unavailability of a training program within a reasonable distance\nfrom the officer's place of employment. If the commissioner determines that\ncircumstances warrant extension of the one-year period, he or she may grant\napproval of such extension. In no instance shall this period be extended beyond\na total of two years from the initial date of appointment or promotion to a\nfirst-line supervisory position, except as otherwise required by law.
