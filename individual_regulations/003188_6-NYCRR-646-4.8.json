  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 646-4.8 - Permit application procedures in stormwater regulatory programs\n\nState Regulations\n\nStormwater permit applications shall be processed in\naccordance with Subpart 645-5 of this Title\n(a) General application requirements. The\nfollowing shall be required to be part of any application for a stormwater\nmanagement permit: (1)\nA complete application\non such form as may be prescribed. (2)\n\nThe appropriate application\nfee. (3)\n\nWhen a project requires a\npermit from any other agency, a list of all such permits which are required, a\nstatement of the status of each such permit application, and a statement of the\nSEQR status of the action. (4)\n\nCopies of applications for all required wastewater management permits, subdivision approvals, site plan review or special use permits and Adirondack\n\nPark Agency permits. (5)\n\nThe real\nproperty tax map section, block and lot number of each lot included in the\nproposed project. (6)\n\nThe names and\nlegal mailing addresses of all landowners adjacent to the project site. For\nmajor projects, the names and legal mailing addresses of all landowners within\n500 feet of the project site. (7)\nA\ndetailed plot plan which shows the site topography, the location and dimensions\nof all existing and proposed structures and impervious surfaces, water bodies, septic systems, wells, and stormwater control devices on the site and within\n100 feet of the site. (8)\nA general\nlocation map suitable to direct officials reviewing the application to the\nproject site. (b) Optional preliminary review for major projects. The following information may\nbe required to be submitted for a preliminary or sketch plan review of\napplications for major projects: (1)\nA\nstormwater concept plan (SCP). The SCP shall include sufficient information to\nevaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential\nimpacts of the proposed development on water resources and the effectiveness\nand acceptability of measures proposed for managing stormwater runoff. Sufficient engineering analysis shall be performed and provided to show that\nthe stormwater control measures in the plan are viable and capable of managing\nrunoff from the site in compliance with these regulations and the\nmunicipality's stormwater management plan and regulatory program. All\nanticipated development of the site and phases of the project, both present and\nfuture, shall be addressed in the SCP. The intent of this conceptual planning\nprocess is to determine the type of stormwater measures necessary for the\nproposed project. The SCP shall include any modifications to the proposed\nproject necessary to achieve the required level of stormwater management. In\norder to ensure adequate planning for management of runoff from future\ndevelopment, a SCP may be required to consider the maximum development\npotential of a site under existing zoning, regardless of whether the applicant\npresently intends to develop the site to its maximum potential. (2)\n\nOn a site with pre-development, an\napplicant shall be required to include within the stormwater concept plan\nmeasures for controlling existing stormwater runoff discharges from the site in\naccordance with the standards of this Subpart to the maximum extent\npracticable. Such measures shall also include those measures reasonable and\nnecessary to, at a minimum, infiltrate the runoff from the first one-half inch\nof precipitation from any storm event for all areas within the site which have\npreviously been developed. (c) Additional requirements for major\nprojects. The following additional requirements are applicable to major\nprojects. (1)\nA stormwater control report\n(SCR) shall be submitted which evaluates the quantity and quality of stormwater\nrunoff resulting from the proposed project for all phases, both present and\nfuture, and if required, for the maximum potential runoff from the site if it\nwere to be developed to its maximum potential under existing zoning. The\nstormwater control report shall be consistent with, and shall be reviewed on\nthe basis of the approved SCP if one was required. (2)\n\nThe SCP and SCR shall be prepared by a\nqualified stormwater professional, who shall be employed by the applicant or\ndeveloper to design and supervise the installation of all stormwater management\nfacilities. Stormwater management shall be within the area of expertise of the\nparticular individual or firm performing the design and construction\nsupervision, and if requested, that individual or firm shall furnish a listing\nand description of all stormwater management projects designed or supervised by\nthem within the past five years. (d) Contents of stormwater control report\n(SCR). An SCR shall contain, at the minimum, the following information: (1)\nA description of the project site and\nsurrounding area within 500 feet as it exists prior to the commencement of the\nproject; a location map; description of the watershed of the subcatchment and\nits relation to the project site; soil types and descriptions on the site and\nsurrounding area; topography of the project site and surrounding area; surface\ncharacteristics including percent cover by asphalt, concrete, crushed stone, grasses, brush, and trees; current land use including allstructures, and\ncharacteristics of the shoreline and its development, if applicable; drainage\npatterns including streams, ponds, culverts, ditches, and wetlands; and\nlocations of utilities, roads, and easements. (2)\nA detailed description of the proposed\nproject including surface characteristics; proposed land use with tabulation of\nthe percentage of surface area to be adapted to various uses; drainage\npatterns; locations of utilities, roads and easements; the limits of clearing\nand grading; and construction cost estimates of stormwater management\nstructures. (3)\n\nHydrologic and\nhydraulic computations of stormwater volume and flow for existing and proposed\nconditions shall be performed. Such computations shall include: (i) description of the design storm\nfrequency, intensity and duration; (ii)\ntime of concentration; (iii)\nsoil curve numbers or runoff\ncoefficients; (iv)\npeak runoff\nrates and total runoff volumes for each watershed area or subcatchment\narea; (v) infiltration\nrates; (vi)\nculvert\ncapacities; (vii)\nflow\nvelocities; (viii)\ndata on the\nincrease in rate and volume of runoff for the 10-year storm and on the change\nin the rate of runoff for the 2-, 10-, 25-, 50- and 100-year storms; (ix)\ndocumentation of sources for all\ncomputation methods and field test results; and\n(x) sufficient information to demonstrate\nthat the proposed development, with its necessary stormwater controls, has been\ndesigned to preserve and maintain the base flow in all streams passing through, adjoining or receiving runoff from the site. (4)\nA description of how the stormwater\ncontrol measures for the project will provide the best available pollutant\nremoval technology. (5)\nA detailed\ndescription of and plans of, stormwater and erosion control measures including: (i) proposed containment facilities and\nstructures; (ii)\ncalculations of\ninfiltration area required; (iii)\ncalculation of retention and/or detention/retention storage requirements and\nstorage volume provided; (iv)\ncalculation or documentation of infiltration rate; (v) calculation for release rate controls\n(orifice or pipe size); (vi)\ndescription of pollution control measures such as filter strips, sand filters, infiltration; (vii)\nprovision for\nemergency overflow; and\n(viii)\nmeasures taken to obviate or reduce the need for runoff control such as use of\nporous pavement, or the minimization of land clearing or paving.
