Lobbyist Bi-Monthly Reports record all actual Lobbying Activity during the\nrelevant filing period. (b) Any\n\nLobbyist who files a Statement of Registration for a Client for any biennial\nperiod must also file Bi-Monthly Reports in accordance with this section, regardless of Compensation, Expenses, or Lobbying Activity. (c) Due date. (1)\n\nLobbyists must file a Bi-Monthly Report\nby the 15th of the month following the end of the bi-monthly reporting period\nin which the Lobbyist was first required to register.

(3)\n\nIf a report is due on a weekend or a\n\nState holiday, it must be received by the Commission on the first business day\nfollowing the weekend or State holiday. (d) Any Bi-Monthly Report that is not timely\nfiled will be subject to the late fee schedule set forth in section\n943.15. (e) Filing Fee. There is no\nfiling fee for a Lobbyist Bi-Monthly Report. (f) Contents. All Bi-Monthly Reports must\ninclude the following information to the maximum extent practicable: (1)\n\nThe name, address, e-mail address, and\ntelephone number of the Principal Lobbyist; (2)\n\nThe names of all Individual Lobbyists who\npersonally engaged in Lobbying Activity during the filing period; (3)\n\nThe name, address, e-mail address, and\ncontact information of all Contractual and Beneficial Clients\n(i) If the Report relates to Lobbying on\nbehalf of a Structured Coalition or a Member of an Unstructured Coalition, the\n\nClient information for Contractual and Beneficial Clients shall be governed by\nthe rules set forth in Section\n943.9\n(h)(3)(iv) and\n(v); (4)\n\nThe identities of any Co-Lobbyists or\n\nSub-Lobbyists, as described in subsection\n943.9\n(h), if\napplicable; (5)\n\nThe subject\nmatter(s) on which Lobbying occurred; and\n(6)\n\nThe governmental action that the Lobbyist\n\nAttempted to Influence which shall include the following, as applicable: (i) The bill, rule, regulation, or rate\nnumber, if available, on which Lobbying occurred; (ii)\n\nThe title and identifying numbers of\n\nProcurement Contracts/documents on which Lobbying occurred; (iii)\n\nThe number or subject matter of an\n\nExecutive Order of the Governor or Municipality on which Lobbying\noccurred; (iv)\n\nThe subject matter\nof and tribes involved in tribal-state compacts on which Lobbying occurred; and/or\n(v) In the event Lobbying is\nconducted in order to influence the introduction, intended introduction, or\nissuance of State legislation or a State resolution, a brief description of\nsuch activity. (7)\n\nThe\nname of the person, organization, or legislative body before which the Lobbyist\nhas lobbied: (i) In the case of Direct\n\nLobbying, the name of the Public Official or Public Official's office or the\nlegislative committee, as applicable, with whom the Lobbyist engaged in direct\ncommunication; For example, if a Lobbyist lobbies a Senator on one occasion\nand also sends out memos in support of a bill to all members of a legislative\ncommittee of which the Senator is a part, such Lobbyist would disclose the\n\nSenator's name and the name of the legislative committee. If a Lobbyist meets with the Commissioner of Taxation and\n\nFinance as well as a staff member of the Office of Real Property Tax Services, such Lobbyist would disclose the Commissioner's title and agency and disclose\nthat they met with a staff member of the named unit or department within the\nagency (the Office of Real Property Tax Services). (ii)\n\nIn the case of Grassroots Lobbying, the\nintended target of the Lobbying Activity, which may be a person, State Agency, Municipality or legislative body. (8)\n\nAll reportable Lobbying Compensation and\n\nExpenses (as defined in section\n943.9\n) paid or owed by the Client\nfor the current period only. (i) Any\nreportable Compensation and Expenses incurred by a Lobbying Organization must\nbe included in the Bi-Monthly Report, regardless of whether the Lobbying\n\nOrganization also files a Client Semi-Annual\n\nReport. (g) If\nthe first required Bi-Monthly Report filed by a Lobbyist for a calendar year is\nnot the Report covering the January-February period (due March 15), the Report\nshould disclose all Lobbying Activities engaged in, Compensation received, and\nexpenditures incurred during the year up to and including the period covered by\nthe Report. For example: if a Lobbyist does not anticipate\nreceiving $5,000 in Compensation and Expenses before the start of the calendar\nyear, but does exceed $5,000 on April 15, the first required Bi-Monthly Report\nis the Report due May 15, covering the March-April Bi-Monthly Period. The\n\nMarch-April Report should thus include all Lobbying Activity, Compensation, and\n\nExpenses for the calendar year, from January 1 until the end of the March-April\n\nBi-Monthly Period, i.e., April 30. (h) Public Corporations. Notwithstanding the\nprovisions in this section, a Public Corporation that is required to file a\n\nStatement of Registration under section 1-e of the Lobbying Act must also\ninclude information pertaining to the Activity, Compensation and Expenses for\nany Retained Lobbyists in the Bi-Monthly Report. (i) Withdrawals. (1)\nA Lobbyist may request that a Bi-monthly\n\nReport be withdrawn, provided the request is made consistent with and meets the\ncriteria set forth in procedures implemented by the Commission. (2)\nA Bi-monthly Report that has been\nwithdrawn pursuant to this subpart is not considered information provided by a\n\nLobbyist under Section 1-s of the Lobbying Act. (j) A Lobbyist has a duty to amend a\n\nBi-Monthly Report after a change to the information filed, including when a\npreviously reported payment is written down, written off, or otherwise modified\nfor bookkeeping purpose. However, after\nthe termination of the\n\nAgreement, any decision by a Lobbyist to write down, write off, or otherwise\nmodify a previously reported payment does not require an Amended Bi-Monthly\n\nReport.
