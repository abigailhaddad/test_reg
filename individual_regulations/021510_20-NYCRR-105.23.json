  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 105.23 - Resident estate or trust\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 605(b)(3)\n(a) A resident estate or trust is: (1)\nthe estate of a decedent who at such\ndecedent's death was domiciled in New York State; (2)\na trust, or portion of a trust, consisting of property transferred by will of a decedent who at such decedent's\ndeath was domiciled in New York State; or\n(3)\na trust or portion of a trust, consisting\nof the property of: (i) a person domiciled in\n\nNew York State at the time such property was transferred to the trust, if such\ntrust or portion of a trust was then irrevocable, or if it was then revocable, and has not subsequently become irrevocable; or\n(ii)\na person domiciled in New York State at\nthe time such trust, or portion of a trust, became irrevocable, if it was\nrevocable when such property was transferred to the trust but has subsequently\nbecome irrevocable. (b) For purposes of subdivision (a) of this\nsection, a trust or portion of a trust is revocable if it is subject to a\npower, exercisable immediately or at any future time, to revest title in the\nperson whose property constitutes such trust or portion of a trust, and a trust\nor portion of a trust becomes irrevocable when the possibility that such power\nmay be exercised has been terminated. (c) The determination of whether a trust is a\nresident trust is not dependent on the location of the trustee or the corpus of\nthe trust or the source of income; provided, however, no New York State\npersonal income tax may be imposed on such trust if all of the following\nconditions are met: (1)\nall the trustees are\ndomiciled in a state other than New York State; (2)\nthe entire corpus of the trust, including\nreal and tangible property is located outside of New York State; and\n(3)\nall income and gains of the trust are\nderived or connected from sources outside of New York State, determined as if\nthe trust were a nonresident. (d) Examples. The following\nexamples illustrate the provisions of this section. Example 1: Taxpayer A who is domiciled in New York State and\ntaxpayer B who is domiciled in New Jersey together create an irrevocable trust. The portion of such trust attributable to property transferred by A is a New\n\nYork State resident trust and the portion of such trust attributable to\nproperty transferred by B is a New York State nonresident trust. Example 2: Taxpayer C creates an irrevocable trust while such\ntaxpayer is a domiciliary of New York State. Subsequent to the creation of such\ntrust, C moves and becomes a domiciliary of California and transfers additional\nproperty to such irrevocable trust. The portion of such trust attributable to\nproperty transferred while C was a domiciliary of New York State is a New York\n\nState resident trust and the portion of such trust attributable to property\ntransferred while C was a domiciliary of California is a New York State\nnonresident trust. Example 3: D, who is domiciled in Canada, creates an irrevocable\ntrust with the X Trust Company in New York City as trustee. The entire corpus\nof the trust consists of securities of American corporations, which are\nactively traded by the trustee on the New York Stock Exchange. The\nbeneficiaries of the trust are all New York State residents. Regardless of\nwhether the trust is held to be a resident of the United States for Federal\nincome tax purposes, it is, for New York State income tax purposes, a\nnonresident trust. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
