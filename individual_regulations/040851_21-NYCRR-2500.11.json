  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 2500.11 - Content of environmental impact statements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An environmental impact statement, like\nan environmental assessment, has three functions: discovery, documentation and\nanalysis. As discovery documents they provide a source of information on the\naction that is not generally so collected. As documentation texts they\nrepresent a formal information retrieval and review process. As analytic tools\nthese documents provide a detailed analysis of the proposed action based on the\nincluded data. An agency bases its judgment on how to proceed with the action\nby reviewing these documents; they are not after the fact justification\ndocuments. Environmental impact statements should be clearly written in a brief\nand concise manner capable of being read and understood by the public. Within\nthe framework presented in subdivision (d) of this section such statements\nshould deal only with the specific significant environmental impacts which can\nbe reasonably anticipated. They should not contain more detail then is\nappropriate considering the nature and magnitude of the proposed action, the\nsignificance of its potential impacts and the existing resources and capability\nof the agency responsible for the statement. (b) All draft and final environmental impact\nstatements shall be preceded by a cover sheet stating\n(1)\nwhether it is a draft or final; (2)\nthe name or other descriptive title of\nthe action; (3)\nthe location\n(county and town, village or city) of the action; (4)\nthe name and address of the agency which\nrequired its preparation and the name and telephone number of a person at the\nagency to be contacted for further information; (5)\nidentification of individuals or\norganizations which prepared any portion of the statement; and\n(6)\nthe date of its completion. (c) If a draft or final\nenvironmental impact statement exceeds 10 pages in length, it shall have a\ntable of contents following the cover sheet. (d) The body of all draft and final\nenvironmental impact statements shall at least contain the following: (1)\na description of the proposed\naction; (2)\na description of its\nenvironmental setting; (3)\na\nstatement of the environmental impact of the proposed action, including its\nshort and long-term effects, and typical associated environmental\neffects; (4)\nan identification of\nany adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided if the proposed\naction is implemented; (5)\na\ndiscussion of alternatives to the proposed action and the comparable impacts\nand effects of such alternatives; (6)\nan identification of any irreversible and\nirretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed\naction should it be implemented; (7)\na description of mitigation measures\nproposed to minimize the adverse environmental impacts; (8)\na description of any growth-inducing\naspects of the proposed action; (9)\na discussion of the effects of the proposed action on the use and conservation\nof energy; (10)\na list of any\nunderlying studies, reports and other information obtained and considered by\nthe agency in preparing the statement; and\n(11)\n(for final only) copies or a summary of\nthe substantive comments received in response to the draft environmental impact\nstatement and the agency's response to such comments. (e) An environmental impact statement may\nincorporate by reference all or portions of other documents which contain\ninformation relevant to the statement. The referenced document shall be made\navailable to the public in the same places where the agency makes available\ncopies of the statement. When a statement uses incorporation by reference, the\nreferenced document shall be briefly described as a part of the annotated\nbibliography of the EIS and its date of preparation provided. (f) The authority will use the environmental\ndocument review notice to record the review status of assessments and impact\nstatements. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
