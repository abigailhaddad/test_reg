  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 830.6 - Service charges\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Service\ncharges shall not apply when credit is extended and payments are made within\nthe standard credit period. The term standard credit period, as used in the\npreceding sentence, means: (1)\nthe credit\nperiod prescribed in section\n830.1\nof this Part; or\n(2)\na substitute credit period published in a\ntariff rule pursuant to the authorization in section\n830.5\nof this Part. (b) Carriers may, by tariff rules, extend credit for an additional time period, subject if they wish to a service\ncharge for that additional time. The combined length of the carrier's standard\ncredit period (as defined in paragraph [a][1] of this section) and its\nadditional credit period shall not exceed the 30-day maximum credit period\nprescribed in section\n830.5\nof this Part. When such a\ntariff rule is in effect, shippers may elect to postpone payment until the end\nof the extended credit period if, in consideration therefor, they include any\npublished service charges when making their payments. (c) Carriers may, by tariff rule, establish\nservice charges for payments made after the expiration of an authorized credit\nperiod. Such a rule shall: (1)\ninstitute such\ncharges on the day following the last day of an authorized credit period; and\n(2)\nnotify shippers: (i) that its only purpose is to prevent a\nshipper who does not pay on time from having free use of funds due to the\ncarrier; (ii)\nthat it does not\nsanction payment delays; and\n(iii)\nthat failure to pay within the authorized credit period will, despite this\nprovision for such charges, continue to require the carrier, before again\nextending credit, to determine in good faith whether the shipper will comply\nwith the credit regulations in the future. (d) Tariff rules that establish charges\npursuant to subdivision (b) or (c) of this section may establish minimum\ncharges. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n830.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
