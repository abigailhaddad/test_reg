  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.43 - Stamping of high pressure boilers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The manufacturer of any complete boiler\nunit to be stamped with the American Society of Mechanical Engineers symbol has\nthe responsibility of assuring through proper ASME Code certification that all\nwork performed by it or others responsible to it complies with all requirements\nof the ASME Code, including design, construction, materials and workmanship. When some portions of a complete boiler unit are supplied by, or ASME Code work\nis performed by others not responsible to the manufacturer, the manufacturer\nhas the duty of obtaining from these other organizations their proper ASME Code\ncertification, covering all parts of a field-assembled boiler and of preparing\nthe appropriate Manufacturers' Data Report Forms comprising such\ncertification. (b) Each boiler, superheater and waterwall to which an ASME Code symbol is to be applied shall\nbe fabricated by a manufacturer who is in possession of the appropriate ASME\nCode Symbol Stamp, and a valid Certificate of Authorization. Six ASME Code\n\nSymbol Stamps are defined as follows: S -- power boiler symbol stamp\nM -- miniature boiler symbol stamp\nE -- electric boiler symbol stamp\nA -- boiler assembly symbol stamp\nPP -- pressure piping symbol stamp\nV --safety valve symbol stamp\n\nAny manufacturer or assembler holding an official \"S\", \"M\", \"E\", \"A\", \"PP\", or \"V\" stamp of the American Society of Mechanical\n\nEngineers and the Certificate of Authorization shall have, and demonstrate, a\nquality control system to establish that all Code requirements including\nmaterial, design, fabrication, examination (by the manufacturer), and\ninspection for boilers and boiler parts (by the authorized inspector) will be\nmet. (c) The manufacturer\nshall stamp each boiler, superheater or waterwall, constructed in compliance\nwith this Part in the presence of the authorized inspector, after the\nhydrostatic test, in the shop of the manufacturer, except that in cases where\nboilers, superheaters, waterwalls, or steel economizers are not completed and\nhydrostatically tested before shipment, proper stamping shall be applied at the\nshop and the data reports required by the ASME Code shall be signed by the same\nor different inspectors who shall indicate the portions of the inspections made\nby the shop and in the field. The stamping shall consist of the appropriate\n\nCode symbol which shall be put on each piece of equipment listed above in the\nlocations specified in the ASME Code. (d) Each boiler shall be stamped with the\nappropriate American Society of Mechanical Engineers symbol and stamped in\naccordance with the National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors\nrequirements. In addition to the symbol, the following items shall also be\nstamped with letters and figures at least 5/16 inch high (5/32 inch on\nminiature boilers if necessary), arranged as shown below: Items on Boilers\n\nManufacturer's serial number\n\nCertified by (Name of Manufacturer)\n\nMaximum allowable working pressure when built\n\nHeating surface (or kilowatt power input for electric\nboilers)\n\nYear built\n\nRated steaming capacity (required only for waste heat\nboilers not equipped for, direct firing)\n\nItems on Waterwalls and Superheaters\n\nManufacturer's serial number\n\nCertified by (Name of Manufacturer)\n\nMaximum allowable working pressure when built\n\nHeating surface in square feet (not required for\nintegral superheaters) (rated BTU per hour absorption for an isolated\neconomizer)\n\nDesign temperature (required only for separately fired\nsuperheaters)\n\nImage\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.43\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
