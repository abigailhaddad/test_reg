If any of the above services are part of the\nhalfway house program, the following definitions apply: Milieu therapy is treatment in which the total environment, that is, the physical surroundings, equipment and staff attitudes are, woven\ntogether in such a way as to enhance the effectiveness of other therapies and\nto encourage the resident's rehabilitation. Group therapy is the application of psychotherapeutic\ntechniques, under trained leadership, to a group including the interactions of\nmembers of the group. Social work counseling and casework utilize the conscious\nadaptive capacities of individuals, their families and related groups, as well\nas those of community resources, in order to improve the adjustment of the\nperson to his environment or the environment to the individual. Recreational and social rehabilitation provide opportunities\nfor residents to socialize with others, both inside and outside of the halfway\nhouse, as well as to participate in activities involving two or more persons. Residents may participate in the planning of social events and assist with\nnecessary preparation. Vocational rehabilitation is that aspect of therapy which deals\nwith a systematic sequence of testing, counseling and training in relation to a\nspecific occupational job or objective. Also included is assistance with\nadjustment to a work environment and the development of appropriate patterns of\nbehavior in a work situation both inside and outside of the halfway\nhouse. 3.

Discharge policies shall take the\nfollowing into consideration: resident has recovered sufficiently to return to his\nhome; resident has improved to the point where another facility in\nthe community can better serve his needs; resident has reached the maximum allowable stay; the resident's needs cannot be met by the program of the\nhalfway house and another community program seems more suitable; the resident is unresponsive to the program and requires more\nintensive stimulation and care than the halfway house is equipped to\ngive; gross lack of cooperation with the program, rules and\nprocedures of the halfway house on the part of a resident; other situations not covered by the above.
