  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 811.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words, or phrases hereinafter\nmentioned shall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters Index Number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adapted\nfrom that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological\nsurvey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a\ndrainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name\nor an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Chemung River watershed in 1937 and has been closely followed in connection\nwith the identification of the waters with the following exceptions: some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the\ntime of its 1937 survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the\nnewer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Chemung River drainage basin may be illustrated\nas follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\n\nPa 3\n\nChemung River\n\nPrimary waters. The 3rd interstate tributary of the\n\nSusquehanna River. Pa 3-57\n\nTioga River\n\nThe 57th tributary of the Chemung River numbered\nconsecutively upstream from the point at which it crosses the New York\n-Pennsylvania state line. Pa 3-57-5\n\nCanisteo River\n\nThe 5th tributary of the Tioga River numbered\nconsecutively from its mouth. Pa 3-57-5-5\n\nGoodhue Creek\n\nThe 5th tributary of the Canisteo River numbered\nconsecutively from its mouth. Pa 3-57-5-5-P 27\n\nGoodhue Lake\n\nThe 27th pond, lake or reservoir encountered in the\nsurvey area of the Chemung River watershed. It is located on Goodhue Creek near\nits headwaters. Pa 3-58\n\nCohocton River\n\nThe 58th tributary of the Chemung River numbered\nconsecutively from its mouth. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs., indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries, respectively, shall mean any\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or\nsubtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include\nonly the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water referenced by such\nwaters index number; where tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned after\nthe waters index number, the specifically designated waters shall include the\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water referenced by such waters\nindex number and all tributaries and subtributaries thereof, which are shown on\nthe reference maps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically designated\nwaters are generally known and which may appear on the reference maps. In cases\nof specifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to\nwhich the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I shall mean a brief\nindication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries\nmay include designations of sections of waters to which a particular assignment\nof a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also include any useful\ninformation pertinent to the classification and standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as\nappearing in table I means map reference number and indicates one or more of\nthe following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on which\nthe specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown. (1)\n\nThe following maps were produced from\noriginal maps which may be procured through the Washington Distribution\n\nSection, Geological Survey or Map Information Unit, New York State Department\nof Transportation.
