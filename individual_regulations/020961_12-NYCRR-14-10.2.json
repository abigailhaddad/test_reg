(1)\n\nAt\nthe beginning of each five-year period thereafter, the factor of safety shall\nbe increased by not less than five tenths except that after a thorough internal\nand external inspection and a hydrostatic pressure test of one and one-half\ntimes the pressure allowed and held for a period of at least 30 minutes, during\nwhich no distress or leakage develops, the pressure may be continued at a\nfactor of 5.5. (2)\n\nIn no case shall\nthe maximum allowable pressure on old boilers be increased, unless they are\nbeing operated at a lesser pressure than would be allowable for new boilers in\nwhich case the changed pressure shall not exceed that allowable for new boilers\nof the same construction. (b) The factor of safety for all standard\nboilers shall not be less than the requirements of section\n14-1.4\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
