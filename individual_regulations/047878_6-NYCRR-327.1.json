  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 327.1 - Permit required\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No person, individual, public or private corporation, political subdivision, government\nagency, municipality, industry, copartnership, association, firm, trust or\nestate, or any other legal entity whatsoever, shall use chemicals for the\ncontrol or elimination of aquatic vegetation in any waters of the State without\nhaving applied for and obtained a written permit to do so from a designated\npermit-issuing official, except as specified in subdivision (c) of this\nsection. (b) Such permit may be\nissued for the use of chemicals in the control or elimination of aquatic\nvegetation, subject to such limitations as may be considered necessary to\nsafeguard water quality. For the protection of riparian uses, no such permit\nshall be issued except where the applicant has certified that the affected\nriparian users have agreed to temporary curtailment of their uses incidental to\ntreatment or unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the\ncommissioner that any nonconsenting riparian users will not be significantly\nadversely affected by the use of the chemicals subject to such limitations as\nare set forth in the permit. Such limitations shall prescribe what chemical or\nchemicals may be applied to the waters under stipulated conditions to protect\nthe public health, safety or welfare, and terrestrial and aquatic life or the\ngrowth and propagation thereof, other than aquatic vegetation intended to be\ncontrolled or eliminated. (c) Such\npermit, however, shall not be required: for the use of copper sulfate for the\npurpose of algae control by a duly constituted water supply agency in its water\nsupply waters; or for chemical control of aquatic vegetation in ponds or lakes\nhaving no outlet to other waters and which lie wholly within the boundaries of\nlands privately owned or leased by the individual making or authorizing such\ntreatment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n327.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
