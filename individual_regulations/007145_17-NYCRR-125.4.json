Tit. 17 § 125.4 - Maintenance responsibility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Property owners having access to a State highway shall be fully responsible for\nthe maintenance of their driveway and channelization including the portion from\nthe highway right-of-way line to the outside edge of the highway shoulder or\ncurb line. This maintenance responsibility includes removal of snow and ice and\nkeeping the portion within the highway right-of-way in a safe condition for the\ngeneral public. Where the owner of a commercial property is required to\nconstruct acceleration, deceleration or turning lanes on the State highway, the\ndepartment may, in the interest of public convenience, provide routine\nmaintenance and remove snow and ice on the portions of these lanes constituting\nan integral part of the State highway. This in no way absolves the property\nowner of the overall maintenance responsibility for the reconstruction and\nmajor repair of these lanes, if necessary. (b) The property owner shall be responsible\nfor the maintenance of ditches, pipes, catch basins, grates and other drainage\nstructures constructed in connection with providing access to his property.

The property owner shall also trim brush and maintain his\nproperty in such a manner as to maintain optimal sight distance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
