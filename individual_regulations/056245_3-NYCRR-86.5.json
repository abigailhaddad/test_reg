  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 86.5 - Public offering of capital stock in connection with the conversion of mutual thrift institutions to stock-form\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A plan of conversion (except to the\nextent governed by inconsistent provisions of section\n86.6\nor by section\n86.12\nof this Part) shall, in\naddition to the requirements of section\n86.4\nof this Part, contain\nprovisions to the effect that: (1)\n(i) Each eligible account holder shall\nreceive, without payment, nontransferable subscription rights to purchase\ncapital stock of the converting institution in an amount no less than the\nmaximum purchase limitation established for the public offering under paragraph\n(3) of this subdivision. In the event of an oversubscription for such shares, after shares have been allocated among subscribing eligible account holders so\nas to permit each such account holder, to the extent possible, to purchase 100\nshares, shares shall be allocated among subscribing eligible account holders on\nsuch equitable basis, related to the amounts of their respective accounts, as\nmay be provided in the plan of conversion. (ii)\n\nSubscription rights to purchase capital\nstock received by officers, directors, trustees, and their associates, of the\nconverting institution based on their increased deposits or shares in the\nconverting institution in the one-year period preceding the eligibility record\ndate shall be subordinated to all other subscription rights to purchase shares\nof capital stock granted pursuant to this Part. (iii)\n\nThe provisions of subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph notwithstanding, a plan of conversion may contain a provision\nthat gives the tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans of the converting\ninstitution (and, where applicable, a holding company formed in connection with\nits conversion to stock form) subscription rights to purchase up to 10 percent\nof the shares to be issued by the converting institution, and which\nsubordinates the subscription rights of eligible account holders to those of\nsuch tax-qualified employee stock benefit plans. (2)\n\nManagement of the converting institution\ncollectively shall not be entitled to purchase more than 25 percent of the\ncapital stock issued by the converting institution in a public offering of such\nstock, and no person (alone, or acting together with any other person or in\nconcert with any group of persons) shall be entitled to purchase more than five\npercent of such stock in such public offering. Any shares of capital stock\npurchased pursuant to the exercise of subscription rights shall be included\nwith the shares purchased in a public offering for purposes of determining if\nthe above-described 25 percent and 5 percent limitations have been violated. As\nused in this section, the term management shall refer to directors or trustees\nand executive officers; provided, however, that such persons shall not be\ndeemed to be acting together or in concert solely as a result of their board\nmembership or employment. (3)\n\nAny\nshares of the converting institution not sold to depositors or shareholders\nwith subscription rights shall be sold in a public offering through an\nunderwriter, or otherwise in whole or in part to the public without an\nunderwriter, subject to the converting institution demonstrating to the\nsuperintendent the feasibility of the method of sale and to such conditions as\nmay be provided in the plan of conversion. Such conditions shall include, but\nnot be limited to: (i) a condition limiting\npurchases in the public offering by any person together with any associate or\ngroup of persons acting in concert to an aggregate of no more than five percent\nof the total amount of shares offered; (ii)\na condition requiring the stock to be\noffered and sold in the public offering to be offered and sold in a manner that\nwill achieve a reasonably wide distribution of such stock. (4)\n\nThe converting institution shall: (i) promptly following the conversion\nregister the capital stock issued in connection therewith pursuant to the\n\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 and undertake not to deregister such capital\nstock for a period of three years after such registration; (ii)\nuse its best efforts to encourage and\nassist a market maker to establish and maintain a market for the capital stock\nissued in connection with the conversion; and\n(iii)\nuse its best efforts to list the shares\nof capital stock issued in connection with the conversion on a national or\nregional securities exchange or on the NASDAQ quotation system. (5)\n\nThe notice of meeting, proxy\ncard, and proxy statement or short-form proxy statement sent to each eligible\naccount holder as required by section\n86.4\n(a)(3)\nof this\n\nPart shall be accompanied by a subscription offering circular and subscription\norder form. Separate and readily distinguishable postage-paid envelopes shall\nbe provided for the return of proxy cards and subscription order\nforms. (b) A plan of\nconversion providing for the public offering of the capital stock of a\nconverting institution may contain provisions to the effect that: (1)\n\nShares of the converting institution not\nsold in the subscription offering or in a public offering pursuant to this\nsection not exceeding one percent of the aggregate shares issued, may be sold\nin such other manner as provided in the plan of conversion. (2)\n\nAny person exercising subscription rights\nto purchase capital stock shall be required to purchase a minimum of 25 shares\nto the extent such shares are available for purchase. In no event shall the\naggregate price for any minimum purchase of shares exceed $500. (3)\n\nInstead of a separate subscription\noffering, all subscription rights issued in connection with the conversion\nshall be exercisable by delivery of properly completed and executed order forms\nto the underwriters or selling group for the public offering. Orders for stock\nin the public offering shall not be filled until after orders of persons\nexercising subscription rights have been filled. (4)\n\nThe converting institution shall not be\nrequired to issue subscription rights to, or accept orders for the purchase of\nshares of capital stock from, persons who are residents of a foreign\ncountry. (c) Pricing and\nsale of capital stock. (1)\n\nNo offer to sell\ncapital stock of a converting institution pursuant to a plan of conversion\nproviding for a public offering may be made prior to approval by the\nsuperintendent of the application for conversion and until the preliminary\noffering circular has been authorized for use by the superintendent. No sale of\ncapital stock may be made except by means of a final offering circular which\nhas been approved by the superintendent. The provisions of this paragraph shall\nnot apply to preliminary negotiations or agreements between a converting\ninstitution and any underwriter or among underwriters who are to be in privity\nof contract with the converting institution. (2)\n\nAny preliminary offering circular which\nhas been authorized for use by the superintendent may be distributed in\nconnection with the offering at the same time as, or after, the proxy statement\nis mailed to depositors or shareholders pursuant to this Part. No final\noffering circular shall be distributed until it has been approved by the\nsuperintendent. The approval of the final offering circular by the\nsuperintendent shall not extend beyond the maximum time period specified for\nthe completion of the sale of all the capital stock in subdivision (e) of this\nsection, or beyond such period of time as the superintendent shall establish\nupon a subsequent approval in the event of the granting of an extension of time\nunder subdivision (g) of this section. (3)\n\nIf the subscription offering is to\ncommence prior to the meeting of the depositors or shareholders held to vote on\nthe plan of conversion, the proxy statement authorized for use by the\nsuperintendent shall set forth the estimated price range. Any preliminary\noffering circular shall set forth the estimated price range. The maximum of\nsuch price range should normally be no more than 15 percent above the average\nof the minimum and maximum of such price range and the minimum should normally\nbe no more than 15 percent below such average. The maximum price used in the\nprice range should be no more than $40 per share and the minimum no less than\n$5 per share. (4)\n\nThe materials\nrelating to the pricing of the capital stock referred to in paragraph (6) of\nthis subdivision shall be delivered to the superintendent before he approves\nthe plan of conversion. The superintendent will review the price information in\ndetermining whether to approve an application for conversion when the offering\nis to commence prior to the meeting of depositors or shareholders, and will\nreview such information in determining whether to approve the final offering\ncircular. (5)\n\nUnderwriting\ncommissions shall not exceed an amount or percentage per share acceptable to\nthe superintendent. No underwriting commissions shall be allowed or paid with\nrespect to shares of capital stock sold in the subscription offering, unless\nthe plan of conversion contains the provision permitted by paragraph (b)(4) of\nthis section; provided, however, that an underwriter may be reimbursed for\nreasonable expenses actually incurred in connection with the subscription\noffering where the public offering is so small that reasonable underwriting\ncommissions thereon would not be sufficient to cover total expenses reasonably\nincurred by the underwriter. (6)\n\nThe pricing information required under paragraph (4) of this subdivision shall\ncomply with the following guidelines: (i) The\nmaterials shall be prepared by persons independent of the converting\ninstitution, experienced and expert in the area of corporate appraisal, and\nacceptable to the superintendent. (ii)\n\nThe materials shall contain a full\nappraisal, including a complete and detailed description of the elements that\nmake up an appraisal report, justification for the methodology employed and\nsufficient support for the conclusions reached therein. (iii)\n\nTo the extent that the appraisal is\nbased on a capitalization of the pro forma income of the converted institution, the materials must indicate the basis for determination of the income to be\nderived from the proceeds of the sale of stock and demonstrate the\nappropriateness of the earnings-multiple used, including assumptions made as to\nfuture earnings growth. To the extent that the appraisal is based on comparison\nof the capital stock of the converting institution with outstanding capital\nstock of existing stock-form thrift institutions, such existing stock\ninstitutions must be reasonably comparable to the converting institution in\nterms of such factors as size, market area, competitive conditions, profit\nhistory, and expected future earnings. (7)\n\nIn addition to the information required\nin paragraph (6) of this subdivision, the converting institution shall submit\ninformation demonstrating to the satisfaction of the superintendent the\nindependence and expertise of any person preparing materials under this\nparagraph. However, a person will not be considered as lacking independence for\nthe reason that such person will participate in effecting a sale of capital\nstock under the plan of conversion or will receive a fee from the converting\ninstitution for services rendered in connection with such appraisal. (8)\n\nIn addition to the information required\nin paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subdivision, the converting institution shall\nfile with the superintendent such additional information with respect to the\npricing of the capital stock of the institution as the superintendent may\nrequest, including, without limitation, a full appraisal. (d) Order forms for subscriptions. (1)\n\nAfter receiving the approval of the\nsuperintendent of its plan for conversion, a converting thrift shall submit\nsaid plan to its eligible account holders as provided in section\n86.4\nof this Part by mailing to\neach eligible account holder a notice, proxy card and proxy statement or\nshort-form proxy statement conforming to the requirements of section\n86.14\nof this Part. (2)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (a)(5) of\nthis section, subscriptions for shares shall be accepted from eligible account\nholders only to the extent that such holders have (i) executed and delivered in\nperson or by mail a purchase order in such form as the converting institution\nshall prescribe, and (ii) accompanied such order with payment (either direct or\nby authorizing withdrawal from a share or deposit account). In the event that\nsubscriptions are cancelled by the converting institution for any lawful\nreason, payments for the same shall be promptly refunded. (3)\n\nEach order form shall be accompanied or\npreceded by an offering circular for the subscription offering or the public\noffering, as the case may be, and a set of detailed instructions explaining how\nto properly complete such order forms. (4)\n\nThe maximum subscription price stated on\neach order form shall be the amount to be paid when the order form is returned. The maximum subscription price and the actual subscription price shall be\nwithin the subscription price range stated in the offering circular. If either\nthe maximum subscription price or the actual subscription price is not within\nthe subscription price range stated in the offering circular, the converting\ninstitution must obtain specific approval as to such price from the\nsuperintendent. If appropriate, the superintendent will condition his approval\nby requiring a resolicitation of proxies and/or order forms. If the actual\npublic offering price is less than the maximum subscription price stated on the\norder form, the actual subscription price shall be correspondingly reduced and\nthe difference shall be refunded to those who have paid the maximum\nsubscription price unless the subscribers affirmatively elect to have the\ndifference applied to the purchase of additional shares of capital\nstock. (5)\n\nEach order form shall be\nprepared so as to indicate to the person receiving it, in as simple, clear and\nintelligible a manner as possible, the actions which are required or available\nto him with respect to the form and the capital stock offered for purchase\nthereby. Specifically, each order form shall: (i) indicate the maximum number of shares\nthat may be purchased pursuant to the subscription rights; (ii)\nindicate the period of time within which\nthe subscription rights must be exercised, which period of time shall be no\nless than 20 days and no more than 45 days following the mailing of the\nsubscription order form; (iii)\nstate the maximum subscription price per share of capital stock; (iv)\nindicate any requirements as to the\nminimum number of shares of capital stock which may be purchased; (v) provide a specifically designated blank\nspace or spaces for indicating the number of shares of capital stock which the\neligible account holder wishes to purchase; (vi)\nindicate the manner of required payment\nand, if such payment may be made by withdrawal from a certificate of deposit, indicate whether such withdrawal may be made without penalty. If payment is to\nbe made by withdrawal from an account or certificate of deposit, a box to check\nshould be provided; (vii)\nprovide\nspecifically designated blank spaces for dating and signing the order\nform; (viii)\ncontain an\nacknowledgment by the eligible account holder or other person signing the order\nform that he has received an offering circular prior to so signing; and\n(ix)\nindicate the consequences\nof failing to properly complete and return the order form, including a\nstatement that the subscription rights are nontransferable and will become void\nat the end of the subscription period. The order form may, and the instructions\nthereto shall, indicate the place or places to which the order forms are to be\nreturned and when the order forms shall be deemed to be received by the\nconverting institution. (6)\n\nThe order form may provide that it may\nnot be modified without the converting institution's consent after its receipt\nas set forth in the order form. If payment is to be made by withdrawal from an\naccount or certificate of deposit, the converting institution may, but need\nnot, cause such withdrawal to be made upon receipt of the order form. If such\nwithdrawal is made at any time prior to the closing date of the public\noffering, the converting institution shall pay interest to the eligible account\nholder on the amount withdrawn as if such amount had remained in the account\nfrom which it was withdrawn until such closing date. (e) Period for completion of sale. The sale\nof all shares of capital stock of the converting insured institution to be made\nunder the plan of conversion shall be completed as promptly as possible and\nwithin 45 calendar days after the last day of the subscription period unless\nextended by the superintendent. (f) Interest on subscriptions. The converting institution shall pay interest at not\nless than the passbook rate on the amounts paid to the institution to purchase\nshares of capital stock in the subscription offering from the date payment is\nreceived by the institution until the conversion is completed or\nterminated. (g) Extension of time\nto complete public offering. (1)\n\nThe\nsuperintendent may grant one or more extensions of the time required to\ncomplete the sale of all shares of capital stock under subdivision (e) of this\nsection, provided that no single extension of time shall exceed 60\ndays. (2)\n\nImmediately upon granting\nof an extension of time pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the\nconverting institution shall distribute to each subscriber in the offering a\nnotice of the extension of time, and of the right of each subscriber to\nincrease, decrease or rescind the subscription at any time prior to 20 days\nbefore the end of the extension period or at any time prior to the date of the\ncommencement of the public offering. (3)\n\nAfter the expiration of the subscription\nperiod, the converting institution shall file with the superintendent, for his\napproval, a notice to be delivered to subscribers upon the occurrence of any\nevent, circumstance, or change of circumstance which would be material to the\ninvestment decision of a subscriber. Any such notice distributed to subscribers\nshall grant to each subscriber the right to increase, decrease or rescind his\nsubscription for a period which shall be no less than the greater of 10 days\nfrom the date of the mailing of such notice or the period remaining in an\nextension of time granted by the superintendent pursuant to and subject to the\nprovisions of this subdivision.
