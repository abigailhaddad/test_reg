  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 4-5.3 - Relief valves for low pressure hot water boilers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Capacity. A low pressure hot water boiler\nshall include a relief valve or valves of a capacity such that with the heat\ngenerating equipment operating at maximum the pressure cannot rise more than 20\npercent above the maximum allowable working pressure if that is 30 psi gage or\nless, nor more than 10 percent if it is more than 30 psi gage. If the steam\nrelieving capacity in pounds per hour is calculated, it shall be determined by\ndividing by 1,000 the maximum Btu output at the boiler nozzle obtainable from\nthe heat generating equipment, or by multiplying the square feet of heating\nsurface by the values given in the table in section\n4-5.2\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart. (b) Increased capacity. When operating conditions are changed or additional boiler heating service is\ninstalled the valve capacity shall be checked and increased if necessary to\nmeet the new conditions. Necessary additional valves may be installed on the\noutlet piping, providing there is no intervening valve nor other branching\npipes between the additional valves and the boiler. (c) Accumulation test. If the total capacity\nof relief valves is not otherwise ascertained they shall be subjected to an\naccumulation test. (d) Type. Required relief valves shall be of the valve. The seats and disks of relief\nvalves shall be of material suitable to resist corrosion. No materials likely\nto fail due to deterioration or vulcanization when subjected to any\ntemperature, not exceeding 275° F. shall be used for any part. (e) Setting. One required relief valve shall\nbe set to relieve at a pressure at or below the maximum allowable working\npressure of the boiler and so arranged that it cannot be reset to relieve at a\npressure higher than the maximum allowable working pressure of the boiler. Any\nadditional valve or valves may be set to relieve at pressures not exceeding by\nmore than 20 percent the lowest pressure to which any other valve is\nset. (f) Size. No required relief\nvalve shall be smaller than 3/4 inch nor larger than 41/2 inch standard pipe\nsize. The inlet opening shall have an inside diameter equal to or greater than\nthe seat diameter. In no case shall the minimum opening through any part of the\nvalve be less than 1/4 inch diameter or its equivalent area. (g) Lifting device. Each relief valve shall\nhave a substantial device which will positively lift the disk from its seat at\nleast 1/16 inch when there is no pressure on the boiler. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n4-5.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
