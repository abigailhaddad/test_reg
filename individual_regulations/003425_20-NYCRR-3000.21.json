  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 3000.21 - Frivolous petitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf a petitioner commences or maintains a proceeding primarily\nfor delay, or if the petitioner's position in a proceeding is frivolous, the\ntribunal may, on its own motion or on the motion of the office of counsel, impose a penalty against such petitioner of not more than $500. This penalty\nshall be in addition to any other penalty provided by law, and shall be\ncollected and distributed in the same manner as the tax to which the penalty\nrelates. The following are examples of frivolous positions: (a) that wages are not taxable as\nincome; (b) that petitioner is not\nliable for income tax because petitioner has not exercised any privileges of\ngovernment; (c) that the income tax\nsystem is based on voluntary compliance and petitioner therefore need not file\na return; (d) that Federal Reserve\n\nNotes are not \"legal tender\" or \"dollars,\" and petitioner therefore cannot\nmeasure his or her income; and\n(e) that only states can be billed and taxed directly. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n3000.21\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
