  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-1.14 - Temporary combustion devices\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General requirements. (1)\n\nThe use of an open salamander, coke\nburner or other device or receptacle of any kind in which charcoal, coal or any\nother fuel or combustible substance is burned for any purpose is prohibited in\nany enclosed area of any building or other structure unless sufficient\nventilation is maintained in such enclosed area to assure a safe atmosphere for\nbreathing and proper combustion. (2)\n\nNo tarpaulin or canvas covering shall be\nlocated nearer than 10 feet from a temporary combustion device unless such\ncovering has been treated with flame retardant chemicals. Tarpaulins and canvas\ncoverings which have been treated with flame-retardant chemicals may be located\nnot less than four feet from a temporary combustion device. Tarpaulins and\ncanvas coverings shall be securely fastened to prevent contact with any\ntemporary combustion device. (3)\n\nTemporary combustion devices shall not be placed on any combustible floor, platform or any other combustible surface unless such surface is protected or\ninsulated for a minimum distance of six feet in a horizontal direction from the\nperimeter of the combustion device on all sides. The minimum overhead or side\nclearance from the combustion device to any combustible material shall be four\nfeet. Exception:The horizontal insulation protection on a\nscaffold platform may be limited to the width of the scaffold platform provided\nthere are no combustible objects or materials within six feet horizontally in\nany direction from the combustion device and that the other pertinent\nprovisions of this section are complied with. (4)\n\nTemporary combustion devices shall be\nprovided with suitable base supports or legs to prevent tipping. (5)\n\nAn approved fire extinguisher of a\nsuitable type shall be located on the same floor or level and within 50 feet of\nevery temporary combustion device being used. When a temporary combustion\ndevice is used on any scaffold platform, an approved fire extinguisher of a\nsuitable type shall be located on such platform. (6)\n\nSolid fuel heaters and oil-fired\nsalamanders are prohibited from use in any building or other structure under\nconstruction or from use on any scaffold. (b) Temporary combustion devices using\nliquefied gas. (1)\n\nGeneral. (i) After June 1, 1972 all combustion devices\nused for temporary heating which use liquefied gas as fuel shall be\napproved. (ii)\n\nLiquefied gas used\nas fuel in temporary combustion devices shall contain an agent which will give\nsuch gas a distinctive and detectable odor. (iii)\n\nAreas in which temporary combustion\ndevices fueled by liquefied gas are used shall have legible warning signs\naffixed to every entrance to such areas. Such signs shall be conspicuously\nlocated so as to be readily visible to persons approaching such areas. Such\nsigns shall bear the words, \"DANGER-- FLAMMABLE GAS\" in letters at least four\ninches in height on a contrasting background. (iv)\n\nTemporary combustion devices\nmanufactured after June 1, 1972 shall be provided with automatic cut-off\ndevices which will shut off the fuel supply in the event of flame failure. Such\ncut-off devices shall be installed at the burners. (v) A designated person shall be in\nattendance on the job site at all times when liquefied gas combustion devices\nare operating. (2)\n\nLiquefied gas cylinders and containers. (i) Cylinders and containers of liquefied gas used as fuel for the heating of\nconstruction shanties, sanitary facilities, field offices or other temporary\nbuildings or structures on construction, demolition or excavation sites shall\nbe located outside such buildings or other structures. Exception:Temporary combustion devices specifically\ndesigned to be attached to gas cylinders or containers. (ii)\n\nThe use of cylinders or containers of\nliquefied gas having stored capacities in excess of 1,000 pounds each is\nprohibited in the interior of any building or other structure. Where such\ncapacity cylinders or containers are used, they shall be stored in central\nareas outside of any building or other structure. Such liquefied gas supply\nshall be located a distance of at least 25 feet from any building or other\nstructure or from any combustible material and shall be protected from the sun\nand high temperatures. (iii)\n\nLiquefied gas cylinders or containers not in use shall be stored or placed at a\ndistance of at least 25 feet from any building or other structures or from any\ncombustible material and shall be protected from the sun and high temperatures. Each storage location shall be provided with at least one approved portable\nfire extinguisher of a suitable type. (iv)\n\nLiquefied gas cylinders or containers\nshall be raised or lowered only in suitable cradles. The use of ordinary slings\nfor such purpose is prohibited. No more than two cylinders or containers shall\nbe handled in a cradle at one time. (v) Liquefied gas cylinders or containers\nshall not be dropped or thrown from any height. (vi)\n\nLiquefied gas cylinders or containers, whether full, partially full or empty, shall be securely fastened in place in\nan upright position and protected from any damage. Such cylinders shall not be\nsupported in the areas of the valves or valve protectors. Exception:In operations where such cylinders must be\nplaced in a horizontal position, as in the extraction of liquid. (vii)\n\nThe control valve of any\nliquefied gas cylinder shall be located at the domed end of such cylinder. When\nnot in use, such control valve shall be protected by its ring guard. A key, wrench or hand wheel shall be maintained on the spindle of every liquefied gas\ncylinder or container at all times during use. The use of a control valve at\nthe combustion device as a sole means of turning off the fuel supply is\nprohibited. (viii)\n\nEach liquefied\ngas cylinder or container shall be provided with a pressure regulator or an\nautomatic pressure reducing device. Such regulator or reducing device shall be\nlocated between the cylinder or container and the combustion device or\ndistribution manifold. (ix)\n\nValves, fittings, piping and other accessories connected to a liquefied gas cylinder or\nbetween a cylinder and a pressure reducing device shall be designed to\nwithstand the maximum hydrostatic cylinder working pressure. (3)\n\nCentral station distribution. Where temporary combustion devices use liquefied gas supplied from a central\nstation, the liquefied gas distribution shall be in accordance with the\nfollowing: (i) Liquefied gas shall be\ndistributed throughout the building or other structure from the cylinder or\ncontainer area to the combustion devices in the gaseous state by means of\nflexible or rigid piping suitable for such use at a pressure not exceeding 20\npounds per square inch gage. (ii)\n\nSuch flexible or rigid branch piping shall extend to a point not more than 10\nfeet nor less than six feet from any temporary combustion device. (iii)\n\nSuch piping shall be provided with\nshut-off valves at each floor or equivalent level take-off from the riser, at\neach branch take-off and at each final take-off. (iv)\n\nThe connections between the flexible or\nrigid piping and the temporary combustion devices shall be by means of armored\nflexible hose. Such hose shall be provided with metal screw connectors which\nshall be maintained in a tight condition. (4)\n\nUse of individual liquefied gas cylinders\nor containers. Where each temporary combustion device is supplied with\nliquefied gas from an individual cylinder or container and a central station\ndistribution system is not used, such use shall be in accordance with the\nfollowing: (i) Each liquefied gas cylinder or\ncontainer shall be securely fastened in an upright position and protected from\nany damage. Such cylinder shall not be supported in the area of the valve or\nvalve protector. (ii)\n\nEach\nliquefied gas cylinder or container shall be located a minimum distance of six\nfeet from any temporary combustion device. Exception:Any temporary combustion device specifically\ndesigned to be attached to a gas cylinder or container. (iii)\n\nLiquefied gas cylinders or containers\nshall be connected to temporary combustion devices by means of armored flexible\nhose not more than 10 feet nor less than six feet in length. Exception:Any temporary combustion device specifically\ndesigned to be attached to a gas cylinder or container. (iv)\n\nSuch armored flexible hose connections\nshall be made by means of metal screw connectors which shall be maintained in a\ntight condition. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
