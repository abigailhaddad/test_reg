  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 346.6 - Duties of chiropractor assuming chiropractic care and treatment of a claimant previously treated by a physician or chiropractor\n\nState Regulations\nA chiropractor authorized to treat workers' compensation\ncases, when requested to render chiropractic treatment to a claimant who has\npreviously been treated by a physician or chiropractor, must, before beginning\ntreatment, make reasonable effort to communicate with the attending\nchiropractor or physician to ascertain the patient's condition and whether or\nnot there is any injury or disease affecting any part of the body outside the\nlimits prescribed by the Education Law for chiropractic care and treatment. Such chiropractor must also advise the attending chiropractor or physician of\nthe name of the person who has requested him to assume care of the case and\nstate the reason therefor. If the new chiropractor cannot contact the attending\nchiropractor or physician, and the claimant's condition is such as to require\nimmediate treatment, the new chiropractor should advise the chiropractor or\nphysician previously in attendance, within 48 hours, that he now has the\npatient in his care and send a copy of such notice to the carrier and to the\nchairman. The preceding chiropractor or physician shall supply the new\nchiropractor with a complete history of the case. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n346.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
