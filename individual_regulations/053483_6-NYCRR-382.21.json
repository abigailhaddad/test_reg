  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 382.21 - Siting criteria applicable to all disposal methods\n\nState Regulations\n\nAny site used for a land disposal facility must meet the\nrequirements of this section. (a) General. (1)\n\nThe site must not be located at\nthe Western New York Nuclear Service Center in West Valley, NY. (2)\n\nThe site must be capable of being\nlicensed and permitted under all applicable State and Federal laws. (3)\n\nThe primary emphasis in disposal site\nsuitability must be given to isolation of wastes, a matter having long-term\nimpacts, and to disposal site features that ensure that the performance\nobjectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this Part are met\nas opposed to short-term convenience or benefits. (4)\n\nThe site and the associated hydrology, geologic formations and groundwater flow systems affecting land disposal\nfacility performance must be capable of being defensibly characterized, modeled, analyzed and monitored. (5)\n\nThe site must include a buffer zone which\nmust be maintained until the end of the institutional control period and of\nsufficient extent, considering the proposed method or methods of disposals: (i) to contain a redundant monitoring system\ncapable of detecting the failure of the disposal units and to allow for any\nnecessary mitigation or remediation; (ii)\nto enable the permittee to maintain the\nsecurity of the site; (iii)\nto\ncontribute to a desirable land disposal facility appearance; and\n(iv)\nto meet the performance objectives of\nsections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this\n\nPart. (6)\n\nAny site to be\nused for disposal of mixed low-level radioactive and hazardous wastes must be\ncapable of meeting the applicable provisions of article 27 of the ECL and\nregulations promulgated pursuant thereto. (7)\n\nThe site must not be located where\ncurrently existing radioactive material, including but not limited to naturally\noccurring radioactive material, may mask the monitoring program. (b) Surface waters and hydrology. (1)\n\nThe disposal units must not be located\ndownstream of a dam or other man-made or natural structure where failure of\nsuch structure could adversely affect the land disposal facility's ability to\nmeet the performance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nThe site must not be\nlocated where potential adverse effects on surface water quality could result\nin contravention of water quality standards or an impairment of the best\nintended usage as specified in Parts 701 and 702 of this Title. (c) Mineral and exploitable\nresources. (1)\n\nThe site must not be located\nin an area where past, present or future exploration or exploitation of natural\nresources could adversely affect the land disposal facility's ability to meet\nthe performance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nThe site must not be\nlocated where existing mined openings and/or boreholes could adversely affect\nthe land disposal facility's ability to meet the performance objectives of\nsections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this Part or\ncould prevent reliable modeling or analyses. (d) Geology, soils and hydrogeology. (1)\n\nThe present and projects geologic and\nhydrogeologic setting of the site, including the effects of construction, must\nbe compatible with the waste disposal method. (2)\n\nThe site geology, soils and hydrogeology\nmust have characteristics and properties which will retard the movement of\nradionuclides,. (3)\n\nThe site must\nnot be located where potential adverse effects on groundwater could result in\ncontravention of groundwater quality standards or an impairment of the best\nintended usage as specified in Parts 701, 702 and 703 of this Title. (4)\n\nThe regional groundwater flow systems\nmust provide a sufficiently long pathway and slow transit time from the land\ndisposal facility to the discharge area to ensure that the performance\nobjectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this Part are\nmet. (5)\n\nThe hydrogeologic unit on\nor within which waste is disposed must not discharge groundwater to the surface\nwithin the disposal site. (e) Seismic risk. The site must not be\nlocated in an area where tectonic processes such as faulting, folding, seismic\nactivity or vulcanism may occur with such frequency and extent as to affect the\nability of the disposal site to meet the performance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this Part, or as\nto preclude defensible modeling and prediction of long-term impacts. (f) Population, land use and ownership. (1)\n\nThe site must not be located where\npresent and projected effects from population growth and other developments, including but not necessarily limited to residential, industrial, military, recreational, commercial and institutional developments, may have the potential\nto adversely affect the land disposal facility's ability to meet the\nperformance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this Part or mask\nthe environmental monitoring program. (2)\n\nThe site must be located on real property\nto which the State of New York can obtain title in fee or any interest therein, as may be necessary. (3)\n\nThe site\nmust be located, based on a consideration of population density in the vicinity\nof the site, to keep the potential population dose as low as reasonably\nachievable. (4)\n\nNo part of the site\nshall be located within any village, town, city or unincorporated area having\nan average population density of more than 1,000 individuals per square mile, as determined from the results of the 1980 decennial count of the U.S. Census\nor more recent census of the United States, New York State, or any political\nsubdivision thereof. (5)\n\nThe site\nmust be of sufficient size to ensure the performance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-32.15 of this Part can be\nmet. (6)\n\nThe site must not be\nlocated on any lands or reservations of Indian tribes or nations or on lands\nthat are not subject to the laws and regulations of the State of New York, including but not limited to lands owned by the Federal government. (g) Traffic and transportation. The condition of existing highways and rail lines likely to be used as routes\nto transport wastes to the site must be adequate, or capable of being made\nadequate, to meet applicable State and Federal laws and regulations and to\nminimize risks to the public associated with transportation\naccidents. (h) Cultural, recreational and natural resources. (1)\n\nThe\nsite must not be located on real property owned in fee by the Federal, State or\nmunicipal governments, or in which such governments have a lesser interest, where the alienation or use of such property is restricted by constitutional\nprovision or statute, including but not limited to property which is: (i) protected by article 14 of the\n\nConstitution of the State of New York; (ii)\nall or part of any national wildlife\nrefuge established pursuant to the National Wildlife Refuge System, 16 USC\n668dd\nand\n668ee\n(see section\n382.99 of this Part); (iii)\na State\nwildlife management area, game refuge, fish hatchery, game farm, or any part of\nthese, or property in which the State has an interest under the fishing access\nor other public access program established pursuant to article 11 or 13 of the\nECL; (iv)\nacquired with the\nassistance of Federal funding pursuant to the Dingell-Johnson Fish Restoration\n\nAct, 16 USC\n777\n-\n777i\nand\n777k\nor the Pittman-Robertson Act, 16\nUSC\n669\n-\n669i\n(see\nsection 382.99 of this Part); (v) all or any part of any migratory bird reservation established pursuant to the\n\nMigratory Bird Conservation Act, 16\nUSC\n715\n(see section 382.99 of this\n\nPart); (vi)\nreforestation area or\npart thereof established pursuant to article 9, title 5 of the ECL; (vii)\ndedicated to or acquired for the\npurpose of being dedicated to the State Nature and Historical Preserve pursuant\nto ECL article 45, State Nature and Historical Preserve Act; (viii)\npart of the National Wilderness\n\nPreservation System pursuant to title 16, chapter 23, of the United States Code\n(see section 382.99 of this Part); and\n(ix)\nwetlands acquired or restored in part or\nin whole with State moneys pursuant to ECL, article 51 or 52, or other\nstatutory provision.
