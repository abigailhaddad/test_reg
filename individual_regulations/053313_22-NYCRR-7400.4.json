This request will be granted by the\ncommission upon a finding by a majority of the total number of its members\nwithout vacancy that the information that would otherwise be required to be\nmade available for public inspection will have no material bearing on the\ndischarge of the employee's official duties. (c) Procedure. (1)\n\nAn employee may request deletion of\none or more items of information from the copy of the financial disclosure\nstatement made available to the public by filing a written, or electronic, request with the commission on or before: (i) May 15th of the year in which the\ndeletion is requested, if he or she is employed by the Unified Court System on\n\nJanuary 1st, or commences employment from January 2nd through April 15th, of\nthat year; or\n(ii)\n30 days from the date that the employee commences employment (which includes a\nchange to a new job title that requires him or her to file) if he or she\ncommences employment with the Unified Court System from April 16th through\n\nDecember 31st of the year in which the deletion is requested. (2)\n\nThe request for\nthe deletion shall include: (i) the name, home address, work address, work telephone number, and job title of\nthe employee requesting the deletion; and\n(ii)\nthe information which the employee\nseeks to have deleted; and\n(iii)\na statement in support of the\nemployee's claim that the information that would otherwise be made available\nfor public inspection will have no material bearing on the discharge of the\nemployee's official duties, giving specific reasons and justifications\ntherefor.

(3)\nA written request for deletion must\nbe signed by the employee requesting the deletion. All requests, written or\nelectronic, must be filed with a complete financial disclosure statement\ncontaining the information sought to be deleted. (d) Commission action. (1)\n\nUpon receipt of a request\nfor deletion of one or more items of information from the copy of the financial\ndisclosure statement made available to the public, the commission shall review\nthe material filed to determine if the information will have a material bearing\non the discharge of the employee's official duties. (2)\n\nIf the commission\ndetermines that additional information would be useful, it may request such\ninformation from the employee requesting the deletion. The commission, in its\ndiscretion, may request a meeting with the employee to discuss the deletion\nrequest. (3)\n\nUnless\nthe commission decides by a majority of the total members of the commission\nwithout vacancy that the information that would otherwise be required to be\nmade available for public inspection will have no material bearing on the\ndischarge of the employee's official duties, the commission shall deny the\nrequest for deletion. In applying the material bearing standard to decide\ndeletion requests, the commission weighs competing public and private interests\nincluding the following: (i) whether the disclosure of the information could pose a safety threat to the\nemployee or his or her family, and the nature of that threat, including its\nseriousness and imminence; (ii)\nwhether the information may relate\nin a substantial and important way to the employee's official duties; (iii)\nwhether the information\ncould reveal or relate to an actual or potential conflict of\ninterest; (iv)\nthe\nemployee's role in the judicial, administrative or managerial process of the\n\nUnified Court System; (v) whether the standard is being\napplied in the case of a spousal/child exemption request or a deletion request. The employee's burden is far greater when seeking an exemption request. The\ngranting of an exemption request means that the relevant information will not\nbe reported at all on the financial disclosure statement, while the granting of\na deletion request means that the information will be reported on the financial\ndisclosure statement, but deleted from the copy made available to the public; and\n(vi)\nsuch other\nfactors as may be relevant. Judiciary Law, section 211(4) and Part 40 of\nthis Title establish a strong public policy favoring disclosure. Thus employees\notherwise required to file, who have requested deletions, must demonstrate that\nan individual exception to this policy is warranted. (4)\n\nThe commission\nshall give written notice of its decision to the employee requesting the\ndeletion. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
