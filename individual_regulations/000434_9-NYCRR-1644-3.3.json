  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1644-3.3 - Computation of interest on State housing bonds\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe first interest payment to bondholders is, ordinarily, due six months after the date of issue of the bonds and the\ninterest is payable semiannually thereafter. Local agencies will accrue\ninterest on State housing bonds at the end of each quarter beginning with the\nmonth of issue at the rate of one quarter of the annual interest on the bonds\nfor each full calendar quarter of the interest year falling within the fiscal\nyear. Interest for fractional parts of a quarter is computed on the basis of a\n90-day quarter, regardless of the actual number of days in that quarter. In\ncomputing interest for fractional parts of a month, the first day of an\ninterest year falling within that month is counted, but not the last day of an\ninterest year. (a) To illustrate, assume that on April 1, 1956 (the beginning of a fiscal year), $1,000,000 in\nhousing bonds was outstanding for a given project. The bonds bear interest at\nthe rate of 1.60 per cent per annum. On July 18, 1956, an amortization payment\nof $200,000 is made. The amount of the annual interest on the $1,000,000 of\nbonds outstanding on April 1, 1956 is $16,000. The interest to be accrued for\nthe quarter ending June 30, 1956, is one quarter of $16,000 or\n$4,000. (b) The interest to be\naccrued for the quarter ending September 30, 1956, taking into account the\namortization payment of $200,000 on July 18, 1956 is as follows: $4,000 ÷ 3 = $1,333.33\n\nInterest for 17 days: $1,333.33 *\n17\n/\n30\n$ 755.55\n\nInterest on $800,000 for 13 days (the number of\ndays remaining in July, assuming a 30 day month) and for the months of August\nand September\n\nInterest for July: $3,200 ÷ 3 *\n13\n/\n30\n= $462.22\n\nInterest for August and September: $3,200 ÷ 3 * 2 =\n2,133.34\n2,595.56\n\nTotal interest to be accrued for quarter ending\n\nSeptember 30, 1956\n$3,351.11\n(c) For the quarter ending December 31, 1956, the interest to be accrued is one quarter of $12,800 or $3,200. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1644-3.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
