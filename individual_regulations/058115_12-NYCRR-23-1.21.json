  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-1.21 - Ladders and ladderways\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Approval required. Any metal or fiberglass ladder which is 10 feet or more\nin length shall be approved. Any other ladder not named or described in this\n\nPart (rule) shall not be used unless approved. (b) General requirements for\nladders. (1)\n\nStrength. Every ladder shall be capable of sustaining without\nbreakage, dislodgment or loosening of any component at least four times the\nmaximum load intended to be placed thereon. (2)\n\nOpaque protective coatings\nprohibited. The use of an opaque protective coating on any ladder is\nprohibited. (3)\n\nMaintenance\nand replacement. All ladders shall be maintained in good condition. A\nladder shall not be used if any of the following conditions exist: (i) If it has a broken member or\npart. (ii)\n\nIf it has any insecure\njoints between members or parts. (iii)\n\nIf it has any wooden rung or step that\nis worn down to three-quarters or less of its original thickness. (iv)\n\nIf it has any flaw or defect of material\nthat may cause ladder failure. (4)\n\nInstallation and use. (i) Any portable ladder used as a regular\nmeans of access between floors or other levels in any building or other\nstructure shall be nailed or otherwise securely fastened in place. Such a\nladder shall extend at least 36 inches above the upper floor, level or landing\nor handholds shall be provided at such upper levels to afford safe means of\naccess to or egress from the ladder. Such a ladder shall be inclined a maximum\nof three inches for each foot of rise. (ii)\n\nAll ladder footings shall be firm. Slippery surfaces and insecure objects such as bricks and boxes shall not be\nused as ladder footings. (iii)\nA\nleaning ladder shall be rigid enough to prevent excessive sag under expected\nmaximum loading conditions. (iv)\n\nWhen work is being performed from ladder rungs between six and 10 feet above\nthe ladder footing, a leaning ladder shall be held in place by a person\nstationed at the foot of such ladder unless the upper end of such ladder is\nsecured against side slip by its position or by mechanical means. When work is\nbeing performed from rungs higher than 10 feet above the ladder footing, mechanical means for securing the upper end of such ladder against side slip\nare required and the lower end of such ladder shall be held in place by a\nperson unless such lower end is tied to a secure anchorage or safety feet are\nused. (v) The upper end of any\nladder which is leaning against a slippery surface shall be mechanically\nsecured against side slip while work is being performed from such\nladder. (5)\n\nWooden ladder rungs. (i) Round ladder rungs shall be not less than one and one-eighth inches in diameter\nand oval rungs shall be of equal strength. The tenons of rungs shall be not\nless than seven-eighths inch in diameter. All tenons shall fit tightly into\nholes which shall either extend through the side rails or be bored so as to\ngive at least thirteen-sixteenths inch of bearing to the tenons. In\nthrough-bore construction, the tenons shall be flush with the outside rail\nsurface of the ladder. All tenon holes shall be located on the center lines of\nthe wide faces of the side rails. The shoulders of each rung shall fit firmly\nagainst the side rails and the tenons secured in place with nails or the\nequivalent to prevent the tenons from turning. (ii)\n\nRung spacing shall be uniform and shall\nbe not less than 12 inches nor more than 14 inches, center to center. (6)\n\nLadder\nsplicing. Ladders shall not be spliced to increase their length except\nthat extension pieces may be spliced to the upper ends of ladders for use as\nhandholds. Such extension pieces shall not bear against the ladder supporting\nobject or structure. (7)\n\nLimited use of metal ladders. Metal ladders shall not be used\nor placed in any location where they may come into contact with any energized\nelectric power line, power facility or any exposed electrical parts of\napparatus or equipment. (8)\n\nSpreaders. All ladders with spreading bases, such as step and\ntrestle ladders, shall be equipped with locking type spreaders to hold such\nbases rigid when in the open position. (9)\n\nPlacement of ladders in door\nopenings. Ladders shall not be placed in door openings unless the\ndoors are securely fastened open, closed and locked or otherwise effectively\nguarded against swinging. (10)\n\nProhibited types of ladders. The use of single pole (scaling)\nladders or rail type ladders where the rungs or cleats are attached across the\npole or rail is prohibited. (c) Single ladders. (1)\n\nLength. Rung or cleat\ntype ladders consisting of a single section shall not exceed 30 feet in\nlength. (2)\n\nCleat type\nladders. (i) Materials. Wood used in the construction of cleat type ladders\nshall be thoroughly seasoned, free from sharp edges and splinters and shall be\nsound. The slope of the grain of side rails and cleats shall be no greater than\none in 15. Wood containing knots which intersect the narrow faces of cleats and\nside rails shall not be used. Wood containing knots which intersect the wide\nfaces of cleats may be used provided such knots are less than one-quarter inch\nin diameter. Wood containing knots which intersect the wide faces of side rails\nmay be used providing such knots are less than one-half inch in diameter, are\nlocated at least one-half inch back from the edges of the rails and are not\nmore frequent than one knot in every three feet of rail length. (ii)\n\nConstruction. (a) Cleats. The minimum size\nof cleats shall be three-quarter inch by three inches for cleat lengths up to\nand including 20 inches and three-quarter inch by three and three-quarter\ninches for cleat lengths up to and including 30 inches. Cleats shall not exceed\n30 inches in length and the maximum vertical spacing between cleats measured\nalong the side rails shall not be less than 12 inches nor greater than 14\ninches, center to center. Cleats shall be set into the side rails one-half inch\nwith a snug fit or they shall be braced by filler blocks between the\ncleats, (b) Side\nrails. The minimum size of side rails shall be one and five-eighths\ninches by three and five-eighths inches for ladders up to and including 19 feet\nin length and one and five-eighths inches by five and five-eighths inches for\nladders greater than 19 feet in length. (d) Extension ladders and\nsectional ladders. (1)\n\nLength. Extension ladders shall consist of not more than three\nsections and shall not exceed 60 feet in length when fully extended. The\nmaximum working length from an extension ladder shall be the length of the\nladder minus the minimum overlap. Minimum overlaps shall be as follows: Length of Ladder in\n\nFeet\n\nMinimum Overlap in\n\nFeet\n\nUp to and including 36\n3\n\nOver 36 up to and including 48\n4\n\nOver 48 up to and including 60\n5\n(2)\n\nAdjustment guides. The\nadjustment guides of extension ladders shall be so attached to the rails as to\nprevent the upper sections from tipping or falling out while in use or during\nadjustment. Each upper section of any extension ladder when extended shall be\nlocked in place by two automatic positive acting locks. (e) Stepladders. (1)\n\nLength. Stepladders with\nside rails exceeding 20 feet in length shall not be used. (2)\n\nBracing. Such bracing as\nmay be necessary for rigidity shall be provided for every stepladder. When in\nuse every stepladder shall be opened to its full position and the spreader\nshall be locked. (3)\n\nStepladder footing. Standing stepladders shall be used only on\nfirm, level footings. When work is being performed from a step of a stepladder\n10 feet or more above the footing, such stepladder shall be steadied by a\nperson stationed at the foot of the stepladder or such stepladder shall be\nsecured against sway by mechanical means. (4)\n\nProhibited use. Stepladders shall not be used as supports for scaffold planking. (5)\n\nStepladder construction. (i) Width. The minimum clear\nwidth between side rails at the top step of a stepladder shall be 12 inches and\nsuch width shall increase a minimum of one inch per foot of length between the\ntop and bottom of the rails. (ii)\n\nTread depth. The depth of the steps or treads of any\nstepladder shall be not less than three inches. (iii)\n\nPail shelf. A pail\nshelf, if provided on a stepladder, shall be designed to fold completely within\nthe ladder. (iv)\n\nMetal\nladder steps. Metal ladder steps of any stepladder shall be\ncorrugated, knurled, dimpled, coated with skid-resistant materials or otherwise\nconstructed or treated to minimize slipping. (f) Ladderways. After June 1, 1972, any ladderway exceeding 70 feet in\nheight shall be equipped with rest platforms spaced at intervals not exceeding\n35 feet. Where ladders are used in series and where a danger of falling\nmaterial or debris exists, such ladders shall be staggered, offset or so\nlocated as to provide protection from such danger.
