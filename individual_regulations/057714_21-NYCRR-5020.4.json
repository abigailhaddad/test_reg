(b) The Medical Board\nmay designate other physicians to make such medical examinations as it may\nrequire. Should any disability applicant refuse to submit to such medical\nexamination, the application shall be summarily denied, and should any\ndisability retiree refuse to submit to such medical examination, the disability\nretirement shall be automatically terminated and all rights to his disability\nretirement allowance shall be forfeited. (c) A member who: (1)\nhas duly filed an application for\ndisability retirement; (2)\nhas\nvalidly elected, as applicable, the declining reserve option or the alternative\noption providing for the payment of a lump sum only; and\n(3)\nis otherwise eligible to retire for\ndisability pursuant to section\n511\nof the\n\nEducation Law or section\n605\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw; shall be eligible to have such optional allowance paid in\nlieu of any active service death benefit, notwithstanding the member's death\nbefore the retirement becomes effective, provided it is established the cause\nof the member's death is directly related to the member's physical or mental\nincapacitation. (d) A member who: (1)\nis eligible to retire for service and has\nduly filed an application for service retirement; and\n(2)\nhas validly elected, as applicable, the\ndeclining reserve option or the alternative option providing for the payment of\na lump sum only; but\n(3)\nis\notherwise eligible to retire for disability pursuant to section\n511\nof the\n\nEducation Law or section\n605\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw; shall be deemed to have simultaneously applied for disability\nretirement and shall be eligible to have such optional allowance paid in lieu\nof any active service death benefit, notwithstanding the member's death before\nthe retirement becomes effective, provided it is established the cause of the\nmember's death is directly related to the member's physical or mental\nincapacitation. Insofar as such application shall be deemed an application for\ndisability retirement, such application for disability retirement shall be\ndeemed canceled upon the member's retirement for service. (e) In the cases described in\nsubdivisions (c) and (d) of this section, the burden of establishing the mental\nor physical incapacitation, the cause of death, and the relationship of such\nincapacitation to the cause of death shall be upon the person or persons\nseeking to avail themselves of this subdivision. Physician, hospital and\nmedical records relating to the foregoing shall, upon receipt by the system, be\ndeemed a part of the member's application for disability\nretirement. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
