All\npretreatment systems shall be subject to the approval of the sewer authority, but such approval shall not relieve the industrial dischargers of the\nresponsibility of meeting any required industrial effluent limitations. All\npretreatment systems shall be adequately engineered and designed to the\nsatisfaction of the general manager and all design reports and plans shall have\nbeen prepared, certified and signed by a professional engineer licensed to\npractice in the State of New York. Any construction for this purpose shall\ncomply with all applicable city and State codes.

These shall include hiring an engineer, completing preliminary\nplans, completing final plans, executing contract(s) for major components, commencing construction, completing construction, etc. (2)\n\nNo increment referred to in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision shall exceed nine months. (3)\n\nNot later than 14 days following each\nmilestone date in the schedule and the final date for compliance, the user\nshall submit a progress report to the general manager including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress to be met on such\ndate and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this increment of\nprogress, the reason for delay, and the steps being taken by the user to bring\nthe construction back into compliance with the schedule. In no event shall more\nthan nine months elapse between such progress reports. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
