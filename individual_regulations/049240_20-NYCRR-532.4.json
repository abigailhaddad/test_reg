  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 532.4 - Presumption of taxability\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1132(c)\n(a) General. (1)\n\nIt is presumed that all receipts for\nproperty or service of any type mentioned in subdivisions (a), (b), (c) and (d)\nof section\n1105\nof the Tax Law, all rents for\noccupancy of the type mentioned in subdivision (e) of said section, and all\namusement charges of any type mentioned in subdivision (f) of said section, are\nsubject to tax until the contrary is established. (2)\n\nPrepaid sales tax on motor fuel. [Tax Law 1132 (h)]\nIn addition to the receipts taxable under section\n1105\nof the Tax Law, it is presumed that\nall motor fuel imported, manufactured, sold, received or possessed in the\nstate, other than motor fuel which is in interstate or foreign commerce, is\nintended for use, distribution or sale in the state and subject to the tax\nrequired to be prepaid under section\n1102\nof the Tax Law until the contrary is\nestablished. For other regulations applicable to motor fuel, see Part 561 of\nthis Title. (b) Burden of proof. (1)\n\nThe burden\nof proving that any receipt, amusement charge, or rent is not taxable shall be\nupon the person required to collect the tax and the customer. (2)\nA vendor who in good faith accepts from a\npurchaser a properly completed exemption certificate or, as authorized by the\n\nDepartment, other documentation evidencing exemption from tax not later than 90\ndays after delivery of the property or the rendition of the service is relieved\nof liability for failure to collect the sales tax with respect to that\ntransaction. The timely receipt of the certificate or documentation itself will\nsatisfy the vendor's burden of proving the nontaxability of the transaction and\nrelieve the vendor of responsibility for collecting tax from the customer. (i) A certificate or other document is\n\"accepted in good faith\" when a vendor has no knowledge that the exemption\ncertificate or other document issued by the purchaser is false or is\nfraudulently presented. If reasonable ordinary due care is exercised, knowledge\nwill not be imputed to the seller required to collect the tax. Example 1: During the course of an audit of a liquor store's books and\nrecords, an auditor, in verifying the amount of nontaxable sales reported on\nthe vendor's quarterly returns, discovered certain sales taxes were not\ncollected on certain allegedly exempt transactions by reason of exemption\ncertificates on file that were actually received from customers other than the\ncustomers to whom the sales were made. It was revealed that two store clerks\nwould make sales to friends and acquaintances without charging tax and charged\nthe sales against certain of the certificates on file. The lack of internal\ncontrol by the store owner which allowed the two clerks to perpetrate a\nfraudulent practice over a period of time without detection indicates that\nreasonable ordinary due care was not exercised by the store owner. Accordingly, the owner is liable for the tax due on the disallowed exempt sales. Example 2: The Brown Manufacturing company purchased machinery and\nequipment which could be used for production or distribution for its New York\nplant from Ajax company, a multistate business. Brown Manufacturing purchased\nthe machinery and equipment, which Brown intended to be used in its\ndistribution area, from Ajax's New York State sales representative. By virtue\nof its size and weight, the machinery and equipment cannot be completely\nassembled prior to delivery to the customer's place of business. Ajax company\nsent its New Jersey based installation crew to the Brown Manufacturing company\nlocation to perform the on-site assembly. Within 90 days of the date of the\ncompletion of the on- site assembly, the Brown Manufacturing company issued an\nexemption certificate to the Ajax company's Accounts Receivable Department\nlocated in Ohio, and did not pay the tax on the purchase of the machinery and\nequipment. The Ajax company's Accounts Receivable Department accepted, in good\nfaith, the completed exemption certificate as it was not in a position to\ndetermine whether or not the machinery and equipment was really being used in\nthe production of tangible personal property for sale and had no reason to\nquestion the claimed exempt status. Therefore, Ajax is not liable for the\nuncollected tax. Example 3: Mr. Jones, who was not a registered sales tax vendor, purchased vinyl siding from XYZ Building and Supply company to install on a\nhouse which he owns. Upon picking up the siding, Mr. Jones improperly issued a\ncontractor's exempt purchase certificate to the vendor, complete with an\napparently valid identification number, and did not pay the tax on the purchase\nprice. Subsequently, the Tax department audited XYZ's nontaxable sales and\ndetermined Mr. Jones had issued a false contractor's exempt purchase\ncertificate. Although the certificate issued by Mr. Jones was false, XYZ\nBuilding and Supply company accepted the completed certificate in good faith as\nit appeared to be properly completed and XYZ had no knowledge that the\ncertificate was false. XYZ Building and Supply company is therefore relieved of\nliability for failure to collect tax on this transaction. Example 4: Same as example 3, except Mr. Jones issued a capital\nimprovement certificate to the vendor in lieu of paying the tax. As stated on\nthe capital improvement certificate, the certificate may not be used by a\ncontractor or a property owner/tenant to purchase building materials or other\ntangible personal property without payment of the tax. Therefore, acceptance of\nthe capital improvement certificate by the vendor on this sale was improper and\nresults in the vendor being held liable for the tax due as reasonable ordinary\ndue care was not exercised. (See also paragraph [4] of this subdivision, Audit\n\nCompliance Verification Procedures.)\n(ii)\n\nAn exemption certificate or other\ndocument is considered to be properly completed when it contains the: (a) date prepared; (b) name and address of the\npurchaser; (c) name and address of\nthe vendor; (d) identification\nnumber of the purchaser as shown on its certificate of authority, or exempt\norganization number as shown on the exempt organization certificate, if any\nsuch numbers are required by the certificate or document. The farmer's\nexemption certificate does not have such a number. Also, the exemption\ncertificate for tractors, trailers or semitrailers does not require the number\nof the purchaser's certificate of authority in all instances. However, if the\npurchaser completing an exemption certificate for tractors, trailers or\nsemitrailers does not have a certificate of authority, such exemption\ncertificate must show the purchaser's highway use tax identification number\nunless the purchaser is a certificated household goods mover, in which instance\nit must show its Interstate Commerce Commission or New York State Department of\n\nTransportation identification number. Absent such identifying numbers, the\nexemption certificate for tractors, trailers or semitrailers is\nincomplete. (e) signature of the\npurchaser or the purchaser's authorized representative; and\n(f) any other information required to be\ncompleted on the particular certificate or document. (iii)\nA certificate or document in\nsubstantiation of an exempt sale is considered timely received by the vendor\nwhen it is received within 90 days after the delivery of the property or the\nrendition of the service. (a) For the purposes\nof this section, the term\n90 days after the delivery of the\nproperty\nmeans that day which is 90 days after the date actual\npossession of the property or a portion thereof is transferred to the\npurchaser. If actual possession is not transferred to the purchaser (such as in\na \"sale and lease back\" transaction or where the property is delivered by the\nvendor at the direction of the purchaser to a third party) it shall mean that\nday which is 90 days after the earlier of transfer of title or constructive\ntransfer of possession to the purchaser. Provided however, where due to size, weight, complexity, or a requirement of fitness or suitability for a specific\npurpose, the tangible personal property sold must be assembled or installed by\nthe vendor or a subcontractor thereof at the delivery site before acceptance of\nthe property by or passing of title to the purchaser, it shall mean that day\nwhich is 90 days after such property is so assembled or installed. (b) For the purposes of this section, the\nterm\n90 days after the rendition of the service\nmeans: (1)\nwith respect to the utility services\ndescribed in subdivision (b) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law, that day which is 90\ndays after the earlier of the completion of the service or the last day of the\nfirst month in which the vendor first commences performing or providing the\nparticular service for or on behalf of the purchaser; (2)\nwith respect to the information services\ndescribed in paragraph (1) of subdivision (c) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law, that day which is 90\ndays after the date any information is first transferred to the\npurchaser; (3)\nwith respect to the\nservices of producing, fabricating, processing, printing or imprinting as\ndescribed in paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law, that day which is 90\ndays after the date that actual or constructive possession of the tangible\npersonal property upon which such services are performed is transferred to the\npurchaser of the service; (4)\nwith\nrespect to the services of: (i) installing, repairing, servicing and maintaining tangible personal property; (ii)\nstorage of tangible personal\nproperty; (iii)\nrentals of safe\ndeposit boxes and similar space; (iv)\nand maintaining, servicing and repairing\nreal property or land described in paragraphs (3), (4) and (5) of subdivision\n(c) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law; that day which is 90\ndays after the completion of the service provided however, with respect to\nwarranty services or services to be preformed on a periodic or seasonal basis, the last day of the first month in which the vendor first commences performing\nor providing the particular service for or on behalf of the purchaser or the\nlast day of the first month for which the vendor is liable for performing or\nproviding the service, if earlier; (5)\nwith respect to the rents for hotel\noccupancy as described in subdivision (e) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law, that day which is 90\ndays after the last day of the first period of occupancy (day, week or month\ndetermined by whether the rent charged is on a daily, weekly or monthly\nbasis). (c) For the\npurposes of this section, the term\n90 days after the delivery of the\nproperty or the rendition of the service\nmeans: (1)\nwith respect to the sale of beer, wine or\nother alcoholic beverages, food and drink as described in subdivision (d) of\nsection\n1105\nof the Tax Law, that day which is 90\ndays after the day such alcoholic beverages, food or drink is provided to the\npurchaser; (2)\nwith respect to\nadmission charges as described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law and charges of a roof\ngarden, cabaret or other similar place as described in paragraph (3) of\nsubdivision (f) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law, that day which is 90\ndays after the earlier of the first day the patron is granted admission to such\na place, or the day any ticket or other evidence of entitlement to admission to\nthe place of amusement or roof garden, cabaret or other similar place is\ntransferred to the patron; (3)\nwith\nrespect to dues as described in paragraph (2) of subdivision (f) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law, that day which is 90\ndays after the last day of the first month such member becomes entitled to any\nmembership privileges. (3)\n\nWhen a\nvendor has met the criteria in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, it is\nprotected from liability for failure to have collected tax from the purchaser\nand the burden of proving the nontaxability of such transaction rests solely on\nthe purchaser. (4)\n\nAudit compliance\nverification procedures. Verification of the exemption certificates and\ndocuments received by a vendor will occur during an audit of its records. The\nverification shall include a review for proper completion and the timeliness of\nand receipt in good faith of such exemption certificates and other documents. (i) When the department decides to examine a\nvendor's records substantiating sales claimed as exempt from tax, the vendor\nwill be notified by the department as to what records, exemption certificates\nand other documents are to be presented. The department will then grant the\nvendor a reasonable period of time in which to retrieve the requested records, exemption certificates or other documents from its recordkeeping system. The\nresponsibility for developing and maintaining a recordkeeping system which is\ncapable of retrieving and substantiating any claimed exemption is on the\nvendor. (ii)\n\nWhere an exemption\ncertificate or document timely received by the vendor is found to be deficient\nin its completion, the vendor will be allowed a reasonable period of time prior\nto the conclusion of the audit to obtain the necessary information to correct\nthe deficiency. When the deficient certificate or document is corrected within\nsuch time allowed, the exemption certificate will be accepted as having been\nproperly completed and received by the vendor within 90 days of the transaction\nand is deemed to satisfy the vendor's burden of proof as to the taxability of\nthe particular transaction. (iii)\n\nRequested exemption certificates and documents which are not submitted to the\ndepartment within the allotted time period and exemption certificates and\ndocuments determined to be deficient which are not corrected within the\nadditionally allotted time period prior to the conclusion of the audit are\ndeemed not to have been properly completed and timely received by the vendor. Any such exemption certificates or documents later presented by the vendor will\nnot, in and of themselves, be considered sufficient to satisfy the vendor's\nburden of proof concerning the taxability of the subject\ntransactions. (iv)\n\nExemption\ncertificates or documents not received by the vendor within 90 days after the\ndelivery of the property or the rendition of the service will likewise not, in\nand of themselves, be considered as satisfying the vendor's burden of proof\nconcerning the taxability of the subject transaction. (v) The failure of a vendor to have timely\nreceived a properly completed exemption certificate or other document\n(including certificates or documents which as described in subparagraph [iii]\nof this paragraph are deemed not timely received or properly completed) does\nnot necessarily mean that the vendor is to be held liable for taxes it failed\nto collect from the purchaser. Prior to the completion of the audit, the vendor\nwill be given the opportunity to submit additional information and other\ndocumentation to prove that the transaction was not subject to tax if this may\nbe done within a reasonable period of time. Such additional information and\ndocumentation that may prove that a transaction was not subject to tax might be\nnothing more in certain circumstances than the purchase contracts and sales\ninvoices. Bills of lading or other evidence of delivery showing sales and\ndelivery may substantiate exempt sales of property to governmental or other tax\nexempt purchasers. Verification may consist of documentation from the\npurchaser, under the purchaser's letterhead, attesting to why a purchase was\nexempt or any other documentation which the department determines may\nsubstantiate the exemption claimed. In the event the purchaser has paid the\ntax, the vendors' tax liability for this transaction would be satisfied. The\ndepartment has the right to review and challenge all information and\ndocumentation submitted. If the vendor cannot provide adequate documentation, the transaction will be considered taxable. (5)\nA vendor is not relieved of the burden of\nproof when it failed to obtain an exemption certificate or accepted an improper\ncertificate, or had knowledge that the exemption certificate issued by the\npurchaser was false or fraudulently presented. (6)\n\nThe fact that a vendor has failed to\nreceive timely or proper documentation of the claimed exempt status of any\nparticular transaction does not change the tax status of the transaction. Thus, a vendor which has timely protested a determination of tax always has the right\nto prove the nontaxability of any transaction through the presentation of\nproper documentation. However, the vendor has lost the opportunity to rely\nsolely upon the receipt of the exemption certificate or document in\nsatisfaction of its burden of proof as to its responsibility to collect tax. Example 5: A resale certificate is not on file for a sale made to an\nentity which has since ceased doing business and it is determined from\ninformation available that the sale was for resale. The sale will be considered\nnot taxable. Example 6: A building material supplier sells materials to a\ncontractor. The contractor is purchasing these materials for the construction\nof a building for an exempt organization. The contractor issues a capital\nimprovement certificate to the supplier within 90 days in lieu of payment of\nthe sales tax. Upon audit, the supplier is notified that this is an improper\ncertificate (a capital improvement certificate may not be issued to purchase\nuninstalled tangible personal property). The department will allow the supplier\na reasonable amount of time to obtain a properly completed contractor's exempt\npurchase certificate from the contractor together with a statement from the\ncontractor that the materials were used in performing a capital improvement for\nan exempt organization with substantiation of that fact. Such substantiation\nmay consist of a copy of the exempt organization certification together with a\ncopy of the contract or a statement by the exempt organization evidencing that\na capital improvement was performed for it. If this information is obtained\nwithin the reasonable time period and has been reviewed and verified by the\ndepartment, the exemption will be allowed. Otherwise, lacking proper\ndocumentation, the sale will be considered a taxable transaction. Example 7: During an audit of a registered art dealer's books and\nrecords, a copy of a sales invoice on file made out to an individual c/o an\nexempt organization's name and address was discovered. The individual paid cash\nand took delivery of the art work at the dealer's place of business. The sale\nof the art work was reported as a nontaxable (2) sale on the art dealer's\nreturn although the art dealer did not have an exempt organization\ncertification on file covering this sale. As more than 90 days had lapsed since\nthe date of sale, the auditor requested that the art dealer obtain an exempt\norganization certification covering the sale and also a written document, dated\nand signed by an authorized official of the exempt organization, verifying that\nthe purchase of the art work was for the benefit of the exempt organization and\nthat the individual paid for the purchase of the art work with the exempt\norganization's funds. The art dealer requested and received a copy of the\nexempt organization certification but not the written documentation. Additional\ntime prior to the conclusion of the audit was allowed for the art dealer to\nobtain the additional documentation. Subsequently, the exempt organization\nprovided a statement written on its own letterhead, dated and signed by the\npresident of the exempt organization, attesting to the fact that the art work\nwas purchased for the benefit of the organization by the treasurer of the\norganization and was paid for with the exempt organization's funds. The sale\nwill be considered nontaxable. (c) Use of\nexemption certificates. (1)\n\nTo enable\npurchasers entitled to an exemption from the sales and compensating use tax to\navail themselves of the exemption and for administrative purposes, the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance provides various exemption certificates. Examples of exemption certificates are forms for: (i) purchases for resale; (ii)\ncapital improvements; (iii)\ntransactions involving exempt\norganizations; and\n(iv)\nexempt use. The use of exemption certificates is governed by the conditions under which\nthey are issued. A vendor is not required to collect tax from a purchaser who\ntimely furnishes a properly completed form which is issued for the designated\npurpose and accepted in good faith. (2)\n(i) Sales tax exemption certificates currently authorized for use may be reproduced\nwithout prior permission from the department provided they are reproduced in\ntheir entirety. (ii)\n\nPrior approval\nmust be obtained from the Technical Services Bureau of the Taxpayer Services\n\nDivision of the department if a person wishes to use an exemption certificate\nwhich has modified language. Where approval is obtained, the certificate must\nindicate on the face of the exemption certificate the fact of such approval and\nthe date approval was obtained from the Technical Services Bureau. If prior\napproval is not obtained, a vendor accepting such certificate will not be\nrelieved of its liability for failure to collect the tax. (3)\n\nAny purchaser issuing a false or\nfraudulent resale or other exemption certificate or document may be subject to\nsuch penalties as: (i) penalty of 100 percent\nof the tax that would have been due had the misuse of the certificate or\ndocument not occurred; and\n(ii)\n$50\npenalty for each certificate or document issued; and\n(iii)\nother monetary penalties as imposed\nunder the Tax Law; and\n(iv)\nthe\ncriminal penalties as prescribed by section\n1817\nof the Tax Law and the Penal Law. Cross-reference: For penalties and interest, see Part 536 of this\n\nTitle. (d) Resale certificate. (1)\nA resale certificate is used to claim\nexemption from tax on purchases of tangible personal property or services which\nwill be resold or transferred to a customer when the: (i) tangible personal property is for resale\nas such or as a physical component part of tangible personal\nproperty; (ii)\ntangible personal\nproperty is for use in performing taxable services under paragraph (1), (2), (3) or (5) of subdivision (c) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law where such property\nbecomes a physical component part of the tangible personal property upon which\nthe services are performed or will be actually transferred to the purchaser of\nthe service in conjunction with the performance of the service; or\n(iii)\nservice is for resale. Example 1: A retail shoe store vendor will give his supplier a resale\ncertificate when he purchases shoes from him for resale. Example 2: A furniture manufacturer will give a lumber supplier a\nresale certificate covering the purchase of lumber which will be manufactured\ninto furniture for resale. Example 3: An auto service station operator will give his parts\nsupplier a resale certificate covering the purchase of repair parts\nincorporated into customers' cars. Example 4: An appliance retailer contracts with an appliance\nserviceman to repair appliances for his customers. The serviceman charges the\nretailer $7 per hour, and the retailer charges his customers $10 per hour. The\nretailer provides the serviceman with a resale certificate and does not pay tax\non the $7 per hour charge. (2)\nA resale certificate is properly\ncompleted when it complies with the provisions of subparagraph (b)(2)(ii) of\nthis section. (3)\n\nWhen property or\nservices are intended for resale and purchased tax exempt with a resale\ncertificate, but later are used or consumed rather than resold, the purchaser\nmust pay a tax on the purchase price. (4)\nA blanket resale certificate may be filed\nwith the vendor by a purchaser to cover additional purchases of the same\ngeneral type of property or service. Each vendor accepting a resale certificate\nmust, for verification purposes, maintain a method of associating a sale made\nfor resale with the resale certificate on file. (5)\n\nContractors who are purchasing tangible\npersonal property for use in performing capital improvement work or repairs on\nreal property are not permitted to use a resale certificate. (e) Exempt use\ncertificate. (1)\n\nAn exempt use\ncertificate is used to claim exemption from State and local sales tax on\npurchases of tangible personal property or services to be used for an exempt\npurpose. (2)\n\nThe certificate may be\nused when purchasing: (i) tangible personal\nproperty exempt from sales and use tax under subdivisions (a) and (c) of\nsection\n1105-B\nof the Tax Law and paragraphs\n(8)-(10), (12), (19)-(21) of subdivision (a) of section\n1115\nof the Tax Law; (ii)\nutilities and utility services exempt\nunder subdivision (b) of section\n1115\nof the Tax Law, and fuel, utilities\nand utility services exempt under subdivision (c) of section\n1115\nof the Tax Law; (iii)\nthe service of storing tangible\npersonal property held for resale in the ordinary course of business; (iv)\ninformation services excluded under\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (c) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law used by newspapers, radio broadcasters and television broadcasters in the collection and\ndissemination of news; (v) tangible\npersonal property exempt from local taxes under section\n1210 (a)(1)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw; (vi)\ntangible personal\nproperty or services exempt under section\n1105 (c)(3)\nof the Tax Law\nwhen performed upon commercial vessels or commercial aircraft; or\n(vii)\nservices exempt under section\n1105-B (b)\nof the Tax Law\nwhen performed upon machinery, equipment or apparatus, or parts, tools or\nsupplies, exempt under sections\n1115 (a)(12)\nand\n1105-B\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (3)\n\nAn exempt use\ncertificate is properly completed when it complies with the provisions of\nsubparagraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section.
