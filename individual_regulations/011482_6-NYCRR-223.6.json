  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 223.6 - Sulfur compound emissions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Existing\nemission sources. (1)\n\nNo person shall burn in\nan existing fuel gas combustion device any gas which contains sulfur compounds\nmeasured as hydrogen sulfide in excess of 50 grains per 100 standard cubic feet\nof gas. (2)\n\nNo person shall cause\nor allow emissions of any sulfur compound into the outdoor atmosphere from any\nexisting Claus sulfur recovery unit in excess of the amount permitted by table\n2, section 212.9(b) of this Title. (b) New emission sources and modifications. (1)\n\nNo person shall burn in a fuel gas\ncombustion device or modification thereof, for which an application for a\npermit to construct is received by the commissioner pursuant to Part 201 of\nthis Title, subsequent to June 11, 1973, any fuel gas which contains hydrogen\nsulfide in excess of 10 grains per 100 standard cubic feet of gas. (2)\nA source owner burning a fuel gas\ncontaining sulfur compounds in excess of that allowed in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision may elect to treat the resulting gases in a manner which limits the\nrelease of sulfur compounds to the outdoor atmosphere if he can show to the\nsatisfaction of the commissioner that this results in the reduction of sulfur\ncompound emissions as effectively as compliance with the requirements of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nNo person shall emit any gases into the\noutdoor atmosphere from any Claus sulfur recovery unit for which an application\nfor a permit to construct is received by the commissioner pursuant to Part 201\nof this Title, subsequent to October 4, 1976, containing in excess of: (i) 0.025 percent by volume of sulfur dioxide\nat zero percent oxygen on a dry basis if emissions are controlled by an\noxidation system or a reduction system followed by an afterburner; (ii)\n0.03 percent by volume of reduced sulfur\ncompounds and 0.001 percent by volume of hydrogen sulfide (calculated as SO\n2\n) at zero percent oxygen on a dry basis if emissions\nare controlled by a reduction system not followed by an after-burner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n223.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
