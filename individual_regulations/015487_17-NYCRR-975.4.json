Examples of indicators that may be used are: (1)\nrevenue vehicle hours per employee\nhour; (2)\nrevenue vehicle miles per\nemployee hour; (3)\noperating cost\nper vehicle hour; (4)\noperating\nrevenue compared to operating cost; (5)\noperating revenue plus voluntary local\nassistance per passenger mile; (6)\nrevenue passengers per vehicle hour; (7)\nrevenue passenger miles per vehicle\nhour; (8)\nrevenue passenger miles\nper vehicle mile; (9)\noperating\ncost per revenue passenger mile; (10)\noperating loss per revenue passenger\nmile; (11)\nrevenue passengers per\nemployee hour; (12)\nrevenue\npassenger miles per employee hour; and\n(13)\npercent on time performance.

(t) Commuter bus service shall mean bus\nservice provided by a bus system, as defined in section\n975.2\n(e), which\nprimarily takes riders to and from work. (u) Deadhead mileage is ineligible for\noperating assistance under this program. It shall include such transit vehicle\nmileage as: mileage between the garage and the beginning of the route where\npassengers may board; mileage from the end of one route to the beginning of\nanother route and mileage from the end of a route to a garage or other service\nor storage facility. In order to categorize transit vehicle mileage as eligible\nrevenue service, except for the return trips of commuter runs, which are\nspecifically considered to be eligible miles in section\n975.2\n(c), a\nviable market for the service must be demonstrated. For example, transit\nvehicle mileage between a bus garage and the beginning of a route cannot be\nclassified as eligible revenue vehicle miles simply because the route is\nredefined as beginning at the garage. Two conditions have to be satisfied for\ntransit vehicle mileage to be considered eligible revenue vehicle miles. First, the increased route mileage, with added stops, must\nbe incorporated formally into published schedules. Secondly, there must be more\nthan incidental use of this additional service by revenue passengers. To prove\nmore than incidental use for such additional service, it will be necessary to\ndemonstrate that the service at least minimally satisfies several of the\neconomy, efficiency, and effectiveness indicators identified in Part 975.4 (o). The following descriptions provide basic guidance as to what constitutes\ndeadhead mileage by type of service: (1)\n\nDeadheading--Scheduled Fixed Route\n\nServices\n\nFor scheduled fixed route transit services, vehicle travel\nbetween the garage and the beginning of the route where passengers may board is\ndeadheading. Other deadheading includes vehicle travel from the end of one\nroute to the beginning of another route, travel from the end of a route to a\ngarage or other service or storage facility. (2)\n\nDeadheading--Non-Scheduled Services\n\nWhile the concept of deadheading is not as well defined for\nnon-scheduled, non-fixed route services, in general, the following guidelines\nshould be followed: (i) Vehicles\ntraveling from a dispatching point to the point where the first passenger will\nbe picked up are considered to be deadheading and not in revenue service; i.e., these miles should not be reported as vehicle revenue miles. (ii)\n\nSimilarly, travel without passengers\nback to a dispatching location should not be reported as vehicle revenue\nmiles. (iii)\n\nAll vehicle travel\nwith or without passengers, when the vehicle is available to carry passengers\nbetween starting and ending places such as described in (i) and (ii) above\nshould be considered as revenue miles. (iv)\n\nIf vehicle storage/maintenance locations\nare different from the locations from which the vehicles are dispatched, travel\nbetween any of these locations should be considered deadheading. (v) School tripper service shall mean mass\ntransportation service provided by a public transportation system which is\nadded to regularly scheduled mass transportation service routes to meet the\nadditional demand of students traveling to and from school. The school tripper\nservice may be eligible for STOA service payments if it satisfactorily meets\neach of the following service characteristics: (1)\n\nSuch service must be open to the general\npublic, shown on the system's guides or schedules available to the general\npublic and be advertised and marketed on a regular basis as being available to\nall people on an equal basis. Such marketing information should include a phone\nnumber for riders to contact the system. (2)\n\nSuch service must be on the established\npublic route structure; i.e., the tripper's route must also be operated at\nother times of the day. However, school trippers are not required to travel the\nentire established route. Minor route deviation from the regular route\nstructure for a portion of a route is permitted. (3)\n\nSuch service must be provided using\nvehicles that meet the requirements identified in section\n975.2\n(e). The\nvehicles must be clearly marked as open to the general public by using one of\nthe following sign patterns: (i) Display of a\ndestination sign reflecting the regular route designation, or\n(ii)\n\nDisplay of such additional, prominent\n\"open to the general public\" signs as may be considered adequate to reasonably\nconvey such a message to the riding public when the vehicle's normal\ndestination sign reflects a school instead of the regular end point for that\nroute. (w) The Commissioner's Annual Report refers to the report required to be completed\nannually by private operators who have been granted regulatory authority. The\nfiling provisions of section\n975.6\nshall apply to the filing of\nthis report. (x) Specialized\ntransportation service shall mean transportation service specifically designed\nto serve the needs of persons, who, by reason of transit disability, are unable\nto use existing mass transportation services designed for the use of the\ngeneral public in a given service area. (y) Specialized Transportation Service Plan\nshall mean a plan and or report for the provision of specialized transportation\nservices to persons who are transit disabled. Such plan shall be developed\nthrough a public participation process and, in urbanized areas, in consultation\nwith the Metropolitan Planning Organization (MPO). The filing provisions of\nsection\n975.19\n(d)(1)\nshall apply to the filing of this report. (z) Coordinated Transportation Service shall\nmean a passenger transportation service formed by the pooling or sharing, by\ncontract, of several pre-existing human or social service agencies' funds, facilities, vehicles, equipment and/or other resources used for passenger\ntransportation, for the purpose of improving the mobility of persons through\nincreased service levels, with the coordinated service under the direction and\ncontrol of a single operator of passenger transportation having the authority\nfor the service's operating hours, routes, schedules, dispatching, and other\noperating features, and the resulting transportation service serving more\npassengers for the same or reduced amount of government expenditure than the\npreviously uncoordinated, piecemeal and duplicative services. (aa)\n\nOperator of mass transportation service\nshall mean the municipal government or public transportation authority which\nassumes full responsibility and liability for the operation of the service, or\na common carrier under contract to said government or authority, for the\npurpose of assuming said responsibility. (bb)\n\nPrincipal operator shall mean the public\ntransportation operator which provides the majority of mass transportation\nservice in a given service area. Where there is more than one operator in a\nservice area, the Department will determine which one is the principal\noperator. (cc)\n\nUrban area shall\nmean an area, as defined by the Census Bureau, that is comprised of all persons\nliving in urbanized areas, see provisions of section\n975.4\n(1), and in\nplaces of 2,500 population or more outside urbanized areas.
