C. 970 (1964 Rev.)\n\nCities over 125,000 Population\nDEBT STATEMENT\nOF\n_________________\nName of Municipality\n________COUNTY, NEW YORK\nPREPARED AS OF\n________, 19________\nForm A. C. 970-1\n\nCities over 125,000 population\nSTATE OF NEW YORK\nDEPARTMENT OF AUDIT AND CONTROL\nDIVISION OF MUNICIPAL AFFAIRS\nThis is the official debt statement form prescribed for use by\ncities having a population of more than 125,000 inhabitants according to the\n1960 federal census. ARTHUR LEVITT\nState Comptroller\nINSTRUCTIONS\n1. Statutory Reference. At each item of indebtedness to be\nincluded and excluded in the debt statement will be found a statutory\nreference. For example, \"135.00(a, 1)\" means \"subdivision 1 of paragraph a of\nsection\n135.00\nof\nthe Local Finance Law\". Reference to that section in the Local Finance Law will\nshow the statutory meaning of the word \"Borrowings\". Wherever a reference\nappears, that section of the Local Finance Law should be consulted. 2. Date of Preparation. The statement must be prepared as of a\ndate not more than thirty days previous to the date of sale of bonds, except\nthat in the case of New York City, such statement must be prepared as of a date\nnot more than sixty days previous to the date of sale of bonds, Local Finance\n\nLaw, section 109.00. 3. Filing. A debt statement must be filed not more than fifteen\ndays nor less than three days before a municipality sells any bonds which are\nrequired to be sold at public sale. The statement must be filed with the State\n\nComptroller and a duplicate copy must be filed with the clerk or corresponding\nofficer of the municipality. In the case of New York City, a copy must also be\nfiled in the same respective periods of time in the office of the chief fiscal\nofficer. Local Finance Law, section 109.00. 4. Fees for Copies. Should it be necessary to obtain either a\ncopy, certified copy, or exemplified copy of a debt statement filed with the\n\nState Comptroller, see paragraph c of section\n141.00\nof\nthe Local Finance Law, as added by Chapter 437 of the Laws of 1947, for fee\nschedule. The statute requires such fees to be prepaid. 5. Average Full Valuation. In computing \"Average Full\n\nValuation\" at page 4, use last completed assessment roll and four preceding\nrolls. The law defines a completed assessment roll as one which has been\n\"completed, verified and filed by the assessors.\" The words \"For Fiscal Year\n\nEnding\" refer to the year for which taxes have been or will be extended on the\nassessment roll rather than the year in which the roll was completed. The\namounts to be used in Column 1 would be the amounts shown on such rolls as\nfiled after the hearing of grievances, regardless of subsequent changes. In\n\nColumn 1, include the assessed valuations of special franchises and pension\nexempt properties but exclude the assessed valuations of all other exempt\nproperties to the extent they are exempt from general taxation. Full valuation\n(Column 3) is determined as follows: Divide the assessed valuation (Column 1)\nby the equalization rate (Column 2) established by the State for such\nvaluation. Where boundary changes have occurred and in the case of\nnewly-created municipalities, see section\n2.00\n(7-a)\nof the Local Finance Law. 6. INCLUSIONS: Re Item 9, Page 4. Include the respective amounts of all\nseveral indebtedness and allocated or apportioned joint indebtedness contracted\nor incurred pursuant to Article II, Title 1-A of the Local Finance Law in\nrelation to a joint service or a joint water, sewage or drainage project. The\namount of joint indebtedness to be so included should not exceed the amount of\nsuch indebtedness allocated and apportioned to the municipality in the bond or\nnote resolution authorizing such indebtedness to be contracted. Joint indebtedness to be included arising out of real property\nliabilities and contract liabilities should not exceed the amount of such\nindebtedness required to be allocated and apportioned to the municipality in\nthe agreement of the participating municipalities in relation to such joint\nservice or project. Where the agreement does not provide for any such\nallocation or apportionment, or in the case of involuntary joint indebtedness, the amount to be allocated and apportioned and included in the debt statement\nof a participating municipality should be in the same proportion as the full\nvaluation of the real estate subject to taxation or assessment by such\nmunicipality for such joint service or project bears to the full valuation of\nthe real estate subject to taxation or assessment by all of the participating\nmunicipalities for such joint service or project. See Local Finance Law, (Page 1)\n\nForm A. C. 970-2\nsection 15.10. However, if the State Comptroller has issued a\ncertificate allocating and apportioning such joint indebtedness pursuant to the\nprovisions of section\n15.10\nof\nthe Local Finance Law, the amounts so allocated and apportioned by the State\n\nComptroller should be included in the debt statements of each respective\nmunicipality as indebtedness. 7.
