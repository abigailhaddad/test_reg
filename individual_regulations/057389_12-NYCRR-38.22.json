  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 38.22 - Surveys, checks and tests\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Surveys--general. Each person who possesses any radiation source shall make, or\ncause to be made, the applicable surveys required under this section and such\nadditional surveys as may be necessary for such person to comply with other\nprovisions of this Part (rule). (b) Instrumentation. Each person required to perform a survey by this Part (rule)\nshall be provided with or have available appropriate calibrated and operable\ninstruments capable of detecting and measuring radiation. (c) Radiation equipment--surveys. Every\ninstallation and mobile source wherein radiation equipment is to be used shall\nbe surveyed during the initial operation of such equipment and whenever any\nchange is made in such installation or mobile source or in its use that might\nincrease the radiation level to which an individual could be exposed. When\nvibrations or other physical conditions exist in such installations or mobile\nsources which may cause changes in the protective features, surveys shall be\nmade at least every six months. (d) Radioactive materials--surveys. Any installation wherein radioactive materials\nare handled or installed which has any readily accessible area in which there\nis reasonable expectation that a radiation level will exist in excess of 2\nmillirems per hour, or any mobile source which could create such a radiation\nlevel, shall be surveyed during the initial operation and whenever any change\nis made in such installation or mobile source or in its use that might increase\nthe radiation level to which an individual could be exposed. (e) Unsealed sources--surveys. Radiation\ninstallations wherein radioactive material not contained in a sealed source is\nhandled or installed shall be surveyed at least once a month for radioactive\ncontamination. With regard to radioactive contamination of surfaces, compliance\nwith section\n38.17\n(a) of this\n\nPart (rule) may be assumed if the limits specified in Table 5 of section\n38.41\nof this Part (rule) are\nmet. (f) Sealed sources--leak test. (1)\n\nEach sealed source containing radioactive\nmaterial other than hydrogen 3, with a half life greater than 30 days and in\nany form other than gas, shall be tested for leakage prior to initial use and\nat successive intervals thereafter not exceeding six months, except that each\nsource designed for the purpose of emitting alpha particles shall be tested at\nintervals not exceeding three months. Notwithstanding the periodic leak test\nrequired by this paragraph, any licensed sealed source is exempt from such leak\ntests when the source contains 3.7 MBq (100 microcuries) or less of beta and/or\ngamma emitting material or 370 kBq (10 microcuries) or less of alpha emitting\nmaterial. Except for alpha sources, the periodic leak test required by this\nparagraph shall not apply to sealed sources that are stored and not being used. The sources excepted from this requirement shall be tested for leakage prior to\nany use or transfer to another person unless they have been leak tested within\nsix months prior to the date of use or transfer. In the absence of the delivery\nof a certificate by the transferor to the transferee indicating that a test\npursuant to the applicable provisions of this Part (rule) was made within six\nmonths prior to the transfer, the source shall not be used until tested for\nleakage. If there is reason to suspect that a sealed source might have been\ndamaged, or might be leaking, such source shall be tested for leakage before\nfurther use. (2)\n\nThe test sample\nshall be taken from selected accessible surfaces of the sealed source or from\nsurfaces of the device in which the source is permanently mounted or stored. The selected surfaces should be those on which contamination would be expected\nto accumulate if the source was leaking. Where applicable, the test sample\nshall be taken with the source in the \" off\"position. (3)\n\nThe leak test technique shall be capable\nof detecting 185 Bq (0.005 microcurie) of removable radioactivity, or from\nsealed radium sources, the escape of radon at the rate of 37 Bq (0.001\nmicrocuries) per 24 hours. (4)\n\nDetection of a leak in any sealed source in excess of the sensitivity levels\nset forth in this subdivision shall result in immediate suspension of the use\nof such source until it is decontaminated and repaired or disposed of in\naccordance with section\n38.20\nof this Part\n(rule). (5)\n\nRecords of leak test\nresults shall be kept in units of microcuries per test sample and maintained\nfor inspection by the commissioner. A report shall be submitted to the\ncommissioner for each source found to be leaking in excess of the above\nsensitivity levels within five days of detection of the leak and shall describe\nthe equipment involved, the test results, and the corrective actions\ntaken. (g) Protective\ndevices. All protective devices such as interlocks, safety switches, fume\nhoods, filters and trapping devices for radioactive gases, shall be maintained\nin good repair and proper operating condition.
