(h) If a\n\nWastewater Treatment System in the Lake George basin is found to be Failing, the\n\nCommission shall afford the landowner a reasonable time period to bring the system\ninto compliance with applicable design standards. The time period afforded for\ncompliance shall be commensurate with the hazard the system poses to public health, the water quality of Lake George, and the natural resources of the basin, but shall\nnot exceed six (6) months from the date of documented Failure. In instances of\nongoing or imminent hazard, such as wastewater collecting on the ground surface or a\ndirect discharge to a surface water, the Commission may require immediate action\nincluding repair, replacement, and/or remediation as necessary. (i) If a Wastewater Treatment System in the Lake\n\nGeorge basin is found to be Substandard, the Commission shall afford the landowner a\nreasonable time commensurate with the hazard the system poses to public health, the\nwater quality of Lake George, and the natural resources of the basin to bring the\nsystem into compliance with applicable design standards. The time period afforded\nfor compliance shall not exceed five years from the date of the documented\n\nSubstandard condition. (j) No\nmodification, repair, or construction of a Wastewater Treatment System shall be\nundertaken until all necessary permits and approvals are obtained from the Review\n\nAuthorities having jurisdiction. All such permits and associated design plans shall\nbe retained by the landowner, and provided to the Commission upon request in such\nformat as may be directed (e.g. electronic pdf). (k) The Commission may grant extensions to the\ntime periods afforded to landowners for Wastewater Treatment System compliance for\ngood cause. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
