  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 191.4 - Point determination\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn analysis should be completed for the highway sections\ncontaining the types of hazards the student encounters. A route to school can\ninvolve walking along one or more highways. As a result, it is not always\nobvious when a new highway segment should be evaluated, especially when\nconditions may change along that highway. A new highway segment exists whenever\nthe facility type on which a student must walk changes. There are four\ndifferent types of facilities: (a) sidewalk (any width) or a shoulder e five feet wide; (b) shoulder < five feet wide; (c) roadway with no shoulder; and\n(d) roadway with a narrow bridge or overpass. In some cases, a highway or several highways with the same\ntype of walking facility, may undergo several changes regarding its volume\nand/or speed limit. To simplify matters, the average volume and/or speed limit\nthat occurs in the segment should be used. For example, over a one mile\nstretch, the following situation occurs for a series of contiguous hiqhways\nwithout adequate shoulders (\ni.e., shoulder < five feet\nwide): Point A to B.15 mile\n\nLow Volume\n40 mph\n\nPoint B to C.35 mile\n\nMedium Volume\n35 mph\n\nPoint C to D.50 mile\n\nHigh Volume\n30 mph\n1.00 mile\n\nThe average speed is 35 mph [(40 + 35 + 30) ÷ 3] and\nwould be used in calculating the point totals. Since the average speed is only\nrequired to be determined to the nearest five mph interval, it can be easily\ncalculated as simply a straight, unweighted average of all the speeds. The\nroute used between home and school must avoid hazardous locations when a more\nreasonable route is available. In addition, the analysis is to be based on\nconditions that will remain basically unchanged throughout the school year. Section 3635-b(2) specifies that transportation will be provided \"on the basis\nthat their most direct walking route to school will traverse a hazardous zone\". However, before a CSZ can be established, alternative solutions must be\ninvestigated. Sometimes, a hazard can be mitigated by changing the route which\nthe student walks to one that is slightly shorter or longer. Such a route could\nbe deemed more \"reasonable\" because it avoids the alleged hazards found on the\nmore direct walking route. For routes where a single hazard exists, determine\nthe type of hazard, the number of points produced by the hazard and the highest\ngrade level that would qualify for bus transportation as indicated in the\naccompanying chart. For routes where several hazards exists, there are two\noptions which can be followed. First, determine the type of hazards that exist\nand calculate the number of points produced by each hazard. Compare the point\ntotals for each hazard and use the point value of the greatest hazard to\ndetermine the highest grade level that would qualify for bus transportation as\nindicated in the accompanying chart. If an area fails to qualify for a specific\ngrade level, then a combination of hazards should be examined. Determine the\ntypes of hazards, the sum of points produced by the two greatest hazards and\nthe highest grade level that would qualify for bus transportation as indicated\nin the accompanying chart. It should be noted that the two hazards identified\nmay be of the same type or of different types. A school route will be\ndetermined to be a hazardous zone for children in certain grades if it produces\nat least the points indicated in the accompanying chart.
