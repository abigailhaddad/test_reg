  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 360.11 - Comprehensive recycling analysis\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following sets forth the requirements for preparation\nof a municipality's comprehensive recycling analysis (CRA). The purpose of a\nCRA is to ensure the development and implementation of a sound, long-range, recyclables recovery program that is an integral component of a sustainable\nsolid waste management system by a municipality, which maximizes the recovery\nof recyclables and reduces the amount of waste managed through thermal\ntreatment or disposal. A CRA must consider the objectives of the State solid\nwaste management policy set forth in section 27-0106 of the ECL and consider\nthe goals and objectives of the current State solid waste management plan and\nprovide for a 10-year planning period. For the purpose of Parts 360, 361, 362, 363, 365, and 369, a Local Solid Waste Management Plan satisfying the\nrequirements of Part 366 of this Title will satisfy the preparation\nrequirements of a CRA. (a) CRA\ncontents. The CRA must include the following: (1)\n\nAn identification of the waste stream\nmust include the following: (i) a description\nof the quantity and composition of the types of solid waste contained in the\nmunicipal solid waste (MSW) (i.e., residential, commercial and institutional\nwaste) subdivided into individual components by type, including, but not\nlimited to: various paper grades (e.g., newspaper, corrugated cardboard, paperboard, and office paper); metal; glass; plastics; textiles; and organics\n(e.g., yard trimmings and food scraps); (ii)\na description of the quantity and\ncomposition of the types of waste contained in the construction and demolition\n(C&D) debris; industrial waste; and biosolids; and\n(iii)\na projection, for each year of the\n10-year planning period, of the quantity and composition of the MSW generated\nwithin the municipality(ies). Projections for future MSW generation must be\nbased on changes in population and must account for seasonal variations and any\nadditional applicable factors impacting waste generation. The source of the\ndata must be identified and can be a combination of data available from the\ndepartment as well as other information available to the municipality. If\nactual data is not available or is incomplete, estimates may be developed based\non available information acceptable to the department. The projection must\ninclude: (a) the actual or estimated quantity\nof recyclables by type; (b) the\nactual or estimated quantity of recyclables expected to be generated; and\n(c) the actual or estimated\nquantity of recyclables that could potentially be recovered whether or not\nfeasible at the time of CRA preparation. (2)\n\nAn evaluation of existing efforts to\nrecover recyclables. This evaluation must include the following: (i) an identification of existing municipal, and known private commercial, institutional, and industrial efforts to recover\nrecyclables. Data must include quantity and types of recyclables recovered, and\na description of the recyclables collection and processing programs, the\norganic recovery programs and the public outreach and education programs\nused; (ii)\na summary of any efforts\nto enforce local disposal and recycling laws during the previous planning\nperiod; (iii)\nan identification of\nany volume-based pricing incentives or other financial incentives\nused; (iv)\na summary of current\nrecycling market agreements; (v) a\ndescription of any local transporter licensing requirements if\napplicable; (vi)\na summary of\nrecycling data collection efforts; and\n(vii)\na summary assessment of any data gaps\nand information needs. (3)\n\nAn identification of available and\npotential markets for recovered recyclables. This identification must be\ndetermined by: (i) a review of available\ninformation concerning potential markets; (ii)\na survey of potential markets for\nrecovered recyclables including an identification of all local and regional\nmarkets contacted, and the material quality requirements and market pricing\nstructures, if available from each of the markets contacted; and\n(iii)\nan identification of the types of\nprocessing necessary to reduce the level of contamination and improve the\nseparation of recovered recyclables to assure market acceptance. (4)\nA description of the existing\nadministrative and financial structure of the municipality(ies). The\ndescription must include: (i) an\norganizational chart(s) depicting the staff or entities responsible for\nimplementing each element of the solid waste management system, including but\nnot limited to, operations, administration, finance, outreach and education, enforcement, and data collection and evaluation; (ii)\nthe financial structure for all solid\nwaste management facilities and programs operated or administered by the\nmunicipality(ies) including: (a) costs, including capital investments, insurance, operation, maintenance, closure and\npost-closure costs (if applicable), administration, and financing; (b) revenues, including fees, fines, and\nrecyclables or recovered energy revenues, general fund contributions, special\ndistrict charges; and\n(c) funding\nmechanisms that are used to finance any facility operations, maintenance, and\nprograms and events administered by the municipality(ies); (iii)\nan identification of all laws and\npolicies related to solid waste management within the municipality(ies) along\nwith a designation of whether the municipality(ies) has adopted and is\nenforcing the identified laws and policies, including but not limited to: (a) the source separation laws adopted\npursuant to section\n120-aa\nof the General Municipal Law (GML); (b) waste importation and/or disposal\nprohibitions, flow control or local waste transporter licensing laws; (c) local product stewardship, green\nprocurement and sustainability initiatives; (d) zoning laws; (e) local environmental justice requirements; and\n(f) a description of any other\nlocal laws adopted or used to implement the solid waste management programs of\nthe municipality that could affect recycling, an assessment of their\neffectiveness, and a description of any proposed amendments, or new legislation\nbeing considered. (5)\n\nAn identification of alternative source\nseparation/recyclables recovery programs considered. This identification must\ninclude a qualitative assessment of alternatives and enhancements to the\nexisting solid waste management program that will decrease the amount of waste\nmanaged through disposal and thermal treatment by increasing waste reduction, reuse and the recovery of recyclables to the maximum extent practicable over\nthe term of the planning period. The assessment must address, at a minimum, the\nintroduction or enhancement of the following efforts or describe why they are\nnot applicable: (i) waste reduction\nprograms; (ii)\nreuse\nprograms; (iii)\nrecyclables\nrecovery programs for paper, metal, glass, plastic, and textiles; (iv)\norganics recovery programs for food\nscraps and yard trimmings; (v) programs to develop or improve local and regional markets for\nrecyclables; (vi)\nenforcement\nprograms; (vii)\nincentive-based\npricing; (viii)\neducation and\noutreach; (ix)\ndata collection and\nevaluation efforts; (x) local waste\ntransporter licensing programs, including an assessment of laws preventing\ncommingling of recyclables with waste; (xi)\nflow control and districting\npotential; (xii)\nC & D debris\nreduction, including deconstruction, reuse and recovery programs; and\n(xiii)\nprivate sector management and\ncoordination opportunities.
