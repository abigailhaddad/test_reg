In addition to section\n602.2\nof this Part, this section\nshall apply to hearings held pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law, section 16.17(a), which provides that the commissioner may not revoke, suspend or limit an\noperating certificate fine the holder thereof for failure to comply with the\nterms of the operating certificate, or any applicable statute, rule or\nregulation, without giving the provider notice and opportunity to be heard. Where a conflict exists between this section and section\n602.2\nof this Part, the provisions\nof this section shall be controlling. (b) Hearing requests. The decision to revoke, suspend or limit an existing\noperating certificate, or to fine the holder thereof, shall be final, unless\nthe provider requests a hearing in writing within 30 days of service of notice\nof the proposed action. Such request shall be made to the commissioner, and\nshall include a copy of OPWDD's notice of proposed action. The request must\nalso include a declaration of the issues alleged to be involved, and\ndocumentation of the provider's position as to each identified issue. (c) Stay of execution of\nproposed action. Except as provided for in Mental Hygiene Law, section\n16.17(b), if the provider makes a valid request for a hearing, the execution of\nany proposed action to revoke, suspend, limit or fine shall be stayed pending\nthe commissioner's determination.

(e) Burden of\nproof. The OPWDD shall present its case first. The burden of proof\nshall be on the OPWDD to present evidence of the provider's failure to operate\nthe facility in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations at the\ntime of the survey of the facility by OPWDD. (f) When the office seeks the revocation, suspension [of] or limitation of an operating certificate previously granted by\nthe OPWDD or to levy a fine on the holder of an operating certificate, either\nparty shall, upon demand and at least seven days prior to the hearing, disclose\nthe evidence that the party intends to introduce at the hearing, including\ndocumentary evidence and identification of witnesses, provided, however, the\nprovisions of this subdivision shall not be deemed to require the disclosure of\ninformation or material otherwise protected by law from disclosure, including\ninformation and material protected because of privilege or confidentiality. If, after such disclosure, a party determines to rely upon other witnesses or\ninformation, the party shall, as soon as practicable, supplement its disclosure\nby providing the names of such witnesses or the additional documents.
