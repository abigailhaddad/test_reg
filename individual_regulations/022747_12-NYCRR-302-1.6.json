Such law interns may, under the immediate supervision of an attorney, appear\nbefore Workers' Compensation Law judges at trial hearings in controverted\nclaims and at all hearings before board panels, and prepare and enter waiver\nagreements. \"Immediate supervision\" of a law intern shall mean that the\nsupervising attorney shall be personally present with the law intern throughout\nthe hearing.

A law intern may appear before the board, in\naccordance with the foregoing supervision requirements, on behalf of any party\nin interest where such party gives written consent to such appearance and\nrepresentation and provided further that the supervising attorney also gives\nwritten consent to such appearance. The written consents herein shall be filed\nin the board case file, together with a retainer in the format prescribed by\nthe chair of the board, including retainers limited to the pending issue. All\nformal filings in the case shall be endorsed by the supervising attorney as\nattorney of record, and may contain the name of the law intern who participated\nin their preparation.

Failure to comply with this subdivision shall be a sufficient\nbasis for denial or revocation of permission to engage in such representation\nby law interns. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
