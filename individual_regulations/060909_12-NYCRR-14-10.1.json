  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-10.1 - Formula for maximum allowable working pressure\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe maximum allowable working pressure on the shell or\ndrum of a boiler shall be determined by the strength of the weakest course\ncomputed from the thickness of the plate, the tensile strength of the plate, the efficiency of the longitudinal joint, or of the ligament between the tube\nholes in shell or drum (whichever is the least), the inside diameter of the\ncourse and the factor of safety allowed by this Subpart. (TS x t x E/R x FS) = maximum allowable working\npressure, pounds per square inch, where\nTS =ultimate tensile strength of shell plates, pounds\nper square inch, t =thickness of shell plate, in weakest course, inch, E =efficiency of longitudinal joint, or of ligaments\nbetween tube holes (whichever is the least), R =inside radius of the weakest course of the shell or\ndrum, inches, FS =factor of safety allowed by this\n\nSubpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-10.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
