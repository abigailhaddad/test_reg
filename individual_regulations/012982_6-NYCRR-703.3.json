  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 703.3 - Water quality standards for pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved solids, odor, color and turbidity\n\nState Regulations\n\nStandards for specific classes are provided in this\nsection. Parameter\n\nClasses\n\nStandard\npH\nAA, A, B, C, AA-Special, A-Special, GA\nShall not be less than 6.5 nor more than 8.5. D\nShall not be less than 6.0 nor more than 9.5. SA, SB, SC, I, SD\nThe normal range shall not be extended by more than\none-tenth (0.1) of a pH unit. Dissolved oxygen (DO)\nA-Special\n\nIn rivers and upper waters of lakes, not less than\n6.0 mg/L at any time. In hypolimnetic waters, it should not be less than\nnecessary for the support of fishlife, particularly cold water species. AA, A, B, C, AA-Special\n\nFor trout spawning waters (TS) the DO concentration\nshall not be less than 7.0 mg/L from other than natural conditions. For trout\nwaters (T), the minimum daily average shall not be less than 6.0 mg/L, and at\nno time shall the concentration be less than 5.0 mg/L. For nontrout waters, the\nminimum daily average shall not be less than 5.0 mg/L, and at no time shall the\nDO concentration be less than 4.0 mg/ L. D\nShall not be less than 3.0 mg/L at any time. SA, SB, SC\nChronic: Shall not be less than a daily average of\n4.8 mg/L*\nRemark: *The DO concentration may fall below 4.8 mg/L for\na limited number of days, as defined by the formula: DO\ni\n=\n13.0\n/2.80 +\n1.84\ne\n-0.1t\ni\nwhere DO\ni\n= DO\nconcentration in mg/L between 3.0-4.8 mg/L and\nt\ni\n= time in days. This equation is\napplied by dividing the DO range of 3.0-4.8 mg/L into a number of equal\nintervals. DO\ni\nis the lower bound of each interval (i)\nand\nt\ni\nis the allowable number of days\nthat the DO concentration can be within that interval. The actual number of\ndays that the measured DO concentration falls within each interval (i) is\ndivided by the allowable number of days that the DO can fall within interval\n(\nt\ni\n). The sum of the quotients of all\nintervals (i...n) cannot exceed 1.0: i.e., n\nt\ni\n(actual)\n[SIGMA]\n< 1.0\ni\n=1\nt\ni\n(allowed)\n\nThe DO concentration shall not fall below the acute\nstandard of 3.0 mg/L at any time. SA, SB, SC, SD\nAcute: Shall not be less than 3.0 mg/L at any\ntime. I\nShall not be less than 4.0 mg/L at any time. Dissolved solids\nA-Special\n\nShall not exceed 200 mg/L. AA, A, B, C, AA-Special, GA\nShall be kept as low as practicable to maintain the\nbest usage of waters but in no case shall it exceed 500 mg/L. Odor\nGA\nShall not exceed a threshold odor number of 3. Color\nGA\nShall not exceed 15 color units (platinum-cobalt\nmethod). Turbidity\nGA\nShall not exceed 5 nephelometric units. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n703.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
