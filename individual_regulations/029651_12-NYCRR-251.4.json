  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 251.4 - Sufficiency of petition and showing of interest\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No petition in a proceeding under section\n705 of SERA shall be dismissed for failure of the petitioner to set forth in\nthe petition all the information required, however, the hearing officer may, if\nnecessary, require information not provided in the petition. (b) Selection of Employee Organization\nin General: Pursuant to section 705.1 of SERA, a petition for\ncertification shall be accompanied by dues deduction authorizations, individually signed petitions in favor of recognition, membership cards, or\nother similar evidence of support for a labor organization. If the evidence is\nsufficient to demonstrate majority support of a single labor organization in a\nunit alleged to be appropriate, the labor organization shall qualify for\ncertification without an election. In the event that the evidence submitted\nproves to represent less than a majority of the appropriate negotiating unit, the submitted evidence shall be treated as a showing of interest. (c) A showing of interest shall be filed\nsimultaneously with a petition or motion to intervene, and must indicate\nsupport for a labor organization or organizations by a minimum of 30 percent of\nemployees in the unit alleged to be appropriate. In the event that the dues\ndeduction authorizations or other evidence of support fail to establish a\nshowing of interest of at least 30 percent of employees in the unit alleged to\nbe appropriate, the director of PEPR shall dismiss the petition. (d) In determining whether the evidence\nsubmitted to establish a showing of interest is timely, the director of PEPR\nshall accept evidence of current membership at the time the petition is filed. The director of PEPR shall also accept dues deduction authorizations, original\ndesignation cards, or petitions on a form prescribed by the board, all of which\nwere signed and dated within one year of their submission. A showing of\ninterest may consist of any combination of the foregoing evidence. Designation\ncards shall be submitted in alphabetical order. The director of PEPR may require that an alphabetized\nlisting of the names of the signatories on individually signed and dated\npetitions be filed within a reasonable period of time after submission of the\nshowing of interest petitions. If such an alphabetized listing is required, the\nperson or persons filing the listing shall simultaneously file with the\ndirector of PEPR a signed declaration that the listing sets forth only the\nnames of the signatories on the showing of interest petitions. (e) A declaration by a person with personal\nknowledge shall accompany the showing of interest and shall contain the same\nelements as required for a declaration in subdivisions (d) through (f) of this\nsection. (f) The director of PEPR\nmay direct an investigation and, at their discretion, if necessary, a hearing\nto ascertain whether the evidence submitted is accurate. If it is determined\nafter investigation or hearing that the evidence is fraudulent or that the\ndeclaration is false, such reasonable action as is appropriate to protect the\nintegrity of the procedures of the board in connection with the pending matter\nshall be taken. Such a determination and such action taken shall be reviewable\nby the board pursuant to section\n253.22\nof this Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
