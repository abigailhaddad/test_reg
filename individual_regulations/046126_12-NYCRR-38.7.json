  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 38.7 - Financial assurance for decommissioning\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each applicant for a license, renewal\nthereof or amendment thereto, authorizing the possession and use of unsealed\nradioactive material of half-life greater than 120 days and in quantities\nexceeding 100,000 times the applicable quantities set forth in Table 4 of this\n\nPart (rule) shall submit a decommissioning funding plan as described in\nsubdivision (d) of this section. The decommissioning funding plan must also be\nsubmitted when a combination of isotopes is involved if R divided by 100,000 is\ngreater than 1 (unity rule), where R is defined here as the sum of the ratios\nof the quantity of each isotope to the applicable value set forth in Table 4 of\nthis Part (rule). (b) Each\napplicant for a license, renewal thereof or amendment thereto, authorizing the\npossession and use of radioactive material of half-life greater than 120 days\nand in quantities specified in subdivision (c) of this section shall either: (1)\nsubmit a decommissioning funding plan as\ndescribed in subdivision (d) of this section; or\n(2)\nsubmit a certification that financial\nassurance for decommissioning has been provided in the amount prescribed by\nsubdivision (c) of this section using one of the methods described in\nsubdivision (e) of this section. In the case of an applicant for a license, this certification may state that the appropriate assurance will be obtained\nafter the application has been approved and the license issued but prior to the\nreceipt of licensed material. As part of the certification, a copy of the\nfinancial instrument obtained to satisfy the requirements of subdivision (e) of\nthis section is to be submitted to the commissioner. (c) Table of required amounts of financial\nassurance for decommissioning by quantity of material. (1)\n\nGreater than 10,000 but less than or\nequal to 100,000 times the applicable quantities set forth in Table 4 of this\n\nPart (rule) in unsealed form (for a combination of isotopes, if R, as defined\nin subdivision (a) of this section, divided by 10,000, is greater than 1, but R\ndivided by 100,000 is less than or equal to 1): $750,000. (2)\n\nGreater than 1,000 but less than or equal\nto 10,000 times the applicable quantities set forth in Table 4 of this Part\n(rule) in unsealed form (for a combination of isotopes, if R, as defined in\nsubdivision (a) of this section, divided by 1,000, is greater than 1 but R\ndivided by 10,000 is less than or equal to 1): $150,000. (3)\n\nGreater than 10,000,000,000 times the\napplicable quantities set forth in Table 4 of this Part (rule) in sealed\nsources or plated foils (for a combination of isotopes, if R, as defined in\nsubdivision (a) of this section, divided by 10,000,000,000, is greater than 1): $75,000. (d) Each\ndecommissioning funding plan must contain a cost estimate for decommissioning\nand a description of the method of assuring funds for decommissioning from\nsubdivision (e) of this section, including means of adjusting cost estimates\nand associated funding levels periodically over the life of the\ninstallation. (e) Financial\nassurance for decommissioning must be provided by one or more of the following\nmethods: (1)\n\nPrepayment. Prepayment is the\ndeposit prior to the start of operation into an account segregated from\nlicensee assets and outside the licensee's administrative control of cash or\nliquid assets such that the amount of funds would be sufficient to pay\ndecommissioning costs. Prepayment may be in the form of a trust, escrow\naccount, government fund, certificate of deposit, or deposit of government\nsecurities. (2)\nA surety method, insurance, or other guarantee method. These methods guarantee that\ndecommissioning costs will be paid should the licensee default. A surety method\nmay be in the form of a surety bond, letter of credit, or line of credit. A\nparent company guarantee of funds for decommissioning costs based on a\nfinancial test may be used if the guarantee and test are as contained in\n\nAppendix C-2 of this Part (rule). A parent company guarantee may not be used in\ncombination with other financial methods to satisfy the requirements of this\nsection. Any surety method or insurance used to provide financial assurance for\ndecommissioning must contain the following conditions: (i) The surety method or insurance must be\nopen-ended or, if written for a specified term, such as five years, must be\nrenewed automatically unless 90 days or more prior to the renewal date, the\nissuer notifies the commissioner, the beneficiary, and the licensee of its\nintention not to renew. The surety method or insurance must also provide that\nthe full face amount be paid to the beneficiary automatically prior to the\nexpiration without proof of forfeiture if the licensee fails to provide a\nreplacement acceptable to the commissioner within 30 days after receipt of\nnotification of cancellation. (ii)\n\nThe surety method or insurance must be payable to a trust established for\ndecommissioning costs. The trustee and trust must be acceptable to the\ncommissioner. (iii)\n\nThe surety\nmethod or insurance must remain in effect until the commissioner has terminated\nthe license. (3)\n\nAn\nexternal sinking fund in which deposits are made at least annually, coupled\nwith a surety method or insurance, the value of which may decrease by the\namount being accumulated in the sinking fund. An external sinking fund is a\nfund established and maintained by setting aside funds periodically in an\naccount segregated from licensee assets and outside the licensee's\nadministrative control in which the total amount of funds would be sufficient\nto pay decommissioning costs at the time termination of operation is expected. An external sinking fund may be in the form of a trust, escrow account, government fund, certificate of deposit, or deposit of government securities. The surety or insurance provisions must be as stated in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (4)\n\nIn the case of\n\nState or local government licensees, a statement of intent containing a cost\nestimate for decommissioning or an amount based on the Table in subdivision (c)\nof this section, and indicating that funds for decommissioning will be obtained\nwhen necessary. (f) Each\nperson licensed under this Part (rule) shall keep records of information\nimportant to the safe and effective decommissioning of the installation, as\nspecified in section\n38.28\nof this Part (rule), in an\nidentified location until the license is terminated by the commissioner. If\nrecords of relevant information are kept for other purposes, reference to these\nrecords and their locations may be used. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
