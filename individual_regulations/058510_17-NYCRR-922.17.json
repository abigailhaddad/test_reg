  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 922.17 - Steam leaks\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Leaks under\nlagging. If a serious leak develops under the lagging, an examination must be\nmade and the leak located. If the leak is found to be due to a crack in the\nshell or to any other defect which may reduce safety, the boiler or steam\nreservoir must be taken out of service at once, thoroughly repaired, and\nreported to be in satisfactory condition before it is returned to\nservice. (b) Leaks in front of\nenginemen. All steam valves, cocks, joints, studs, bolts, and seams shall be\nkept in such repair that they will not emit steam in front of the enginemen so\nas to obscure their vision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n922.17\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
