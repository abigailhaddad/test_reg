  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 363.2 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Chapter 537 of\nthe Laws of 1994 amended sections\n603\nand\n612\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw with respect to the eligibility of members covered by the provisions of\narticle 15 of such law to retire at age 55, with benefit reduction for early\n(prior to attainment of age 62) retirement. Chapter 537 also amended sections\n603 and 612 so as to permit individuals covered by article 15 to retire at age\n55 with no reduction for such early retirement where the individual has at\nleast 30 years of credited service at retirement. (b) With the exception of certain corrections\nofficers and security hospital treatment assistants who have waived article 15\ncoverage as a prerequisite to eligibility to participate in special plans\nprovided by article 14, members of the New York State and Local Employees'\nRetirement System who are covered by article 14 (sometimes hereinafter referred\nto as \"article 14 members\") are also covered by article 15 of such law. Therefore, an article 14 member who applies for service or vested retirement\nbenefits is entitled to benefits calculated under the article which will\nprovide the greater benefit (assuming the member meets the eligibility\nrequirements under both articles). (c) For certain article 14 members, the\namount of the service retirement benefit and the vested retirement benefit\npayable under article 15 will always be greater than the amount that would be\npayable under article 14, regardless of how long such an individual may live\nfollowing retirement. The article 14 members for whom the article 15\ncalculation will always produce a larger monthly benefit are those who, on the\neffective date of retirement: (1)\nhave accrued\nat least 30 years of service credit; or\n(2)\nhave attained age 60 and who have accrued\nless than 20 years of credited service; or\n(3)\nhave attained age 60 and have accrued at\nleast 25 years of credited service. In view of the above, the Retirement System\nwill calculate benefits for these three groups of individuals under article 15, as it would serve no valid purpose to require them to elect between the two\narticles. (d) By\ncontrast, it cannot be determined at the time of retirement whether benefits\nwill ultimately be greater under article 14 or article 15 for two other groups\nof article 14 members: those who, on the effective date of retirement, (1)\nhave not attained age 60 and accrued less\nthan 30 years of credited service; or\n(2)\nhave not attained age 62, and have\naccrued at least 20, but less than 25 years of credited service. For these two\ngroups of individuals, the monthly allowance will be greater under article 14\nthan under article 15 until attainment of age 62, at which time, article 14\nbenefits are reduced - to amounts which may be below article 15 levels. (This\nreduction is a statutory offset by the amount Social Security benefits\npotentially payable.) Accordingly, whether the benefits payable under article\n14 will ultimately be greater over the pensioner's lifetime than those payable\nunder article 15 may depend on how long the individual will live following\nretirement. Furthermore, an individual may simply prefer to receive benefits\ncalculated under article 14, which produces the larger immediate monthly\nbenefit, even though article 15 might ultimately produce a greater total\nbenefit over the individual's lifetime. Accordingly, it is appropriate to\npermit such individuals to elect to receive benefits calculated under either\narticle 14 or article 15. This Part will provide the procedure under which such\nindividuals shall elect to retire under either article 14 or article\n15. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
