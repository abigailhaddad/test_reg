Such notice shall include a detailed description of the applicant's\nproposed products or services and shall also include appropriate contact\ninformation for the university or college representative responsible for\nreceiving START-UP NY business applications and all other information as\ndetermined by the commissioner; (c) an attestation by the applicant that it does not compete with other businesses\nin the same community but outside the tax-free NY area; (d) in the event that a potential competitor\nis identified, the sponsor must seek a letter from the commissioner determining\nwhether the applicant business would compete with other businesses in the same\ncommunity but outside the tax-free NY area. In such case, the commissioner\nshall conduct a review of available information and make a final determination\nas to whether the applicant has a competitor in the same community. Such review\nshall include, but not be limited to, a comparison of the products and/or\nservices proposed to be provided by the business applicant and the products\nand/or services provided by the potential competitor or competitors. The\ncommissioner will make the final determination about whether the business\napplicant will compete with other existing businesses in the same community but\noutside the tax-free NY area. (ix)\ncertification that the business's\nparticipation in the START-UP NY Program will have positive community and\neconomic benefits; (x) the prior\nthree years of Federal and State income or franchise tax returns, unemployment\ninsurance quarterly returns, real property tax bills and audited financial\nstatements; (xi)\nthe employer\nidentification or social security numbers for all related persons to the\nbusiness, including those of any members of a limited liability company or\npartners in a partnership; (xii)\na\nlist and description of all related persons to the business and certification\nthat jobs are not being shifted within the State; (xiii)\ncertification, under penalty of\nperjury, that the applicant is in substantial compliance with all\nenvironmental, worker protection, and local, State and Federal tax\nlaws; (xiv)\nwhether the business\nhas previously applied for acceptance to locate into a tax-free NY area and the\nstatus of that application; (5)\ninclude a statement of performance\nbenchmarks, identifying the number of net new jobs that must be created, the\nschedule forecasting a five-year plan or projection for creating those jobs, and details on job titles and expected salaries. This statement of performance\nbenchmarks must also indicate the maximum number of net new jobs eligible for\nthe personal income tax benefit described in section\n39 (e)\nof the Tax Law to be\ncreated; (6)\ninclude a statement of\nconsequences for the failure to meet performance benchmarks, as determined by\nthe business applicant and the sponsor, which shall include one or more of the\nfollowing: (i) suspension of such business's\nparticipation in the START-UP NY Program for one or more tax years as specified\nin such application; (ii)\ntermination of such business's participation in the START-UP NY Program; or\n(iii)\nproportional recovery of\ntax benefits awarded under the START-UP NY Program as specified in section\n39\nof the Tax Law. (a) In the event that the business chooses\nproportional recovery of tax benefits as a consequence of realizing job\ncreation less than the estimated amount, and the number of net new jobs created\nis at least 75 percent of the number of net new jobs promised, then the tax\nbenefits shall be reduced by the percentage by which the business failed to\nmeet its performance benchmark, calculated as the ratio of the difference\nbetween new net jobs promised and actual net new jobs created divided by the\nnet new jobs promised. For purposes of example, if the business promised to\ncreate 100 net new jobs but created only 90 net new jobs, the difference is 10\nnet new jobs. Dividing those 10 jobs not created by the 100 jobs promised shows\nthat the number of jobs created is 10 percent less than the number of jobs\npromised. The business's tax benefits would therefore be reduced by 10\npercent. (b) In the event that the\nbusiness chooses proportional recovery of tax benefits as a consequence of\nrealizing job creation less than the estimated amount, and the number of net\nnew jobs created is less than 75 percent of the number of net new jobs promised\nin any three years during the 10-year job creation schedule, then: (1)\nin the first year that the business does\nnot meet the 75 percent threshold, there shall be a proportional recovery of\ntax benefits; (2)\nin the second\nyear that the business does not meet the 75 percent threshold, such business's\nparticipation in the START-UP NY Program will be suspended; and\n(3)\nin the third year that the business does\nnot meet the 75 percent threshold, such business's participation in the\nSTART-UP NY Program may be terminated; (7)\nin accordance with section\n89\n(5)\nof the Public Officers Law, identify with\nspecificity any information in the application that the applicant deems to be a\ntrade secret or otherwise exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of\n\nInformation Law, article 6 of the Public Officers Law. (e) The sponsor, upon receipt of a complete\napplication from a business applicant, shall determine whether the business\napplicant meets the eligibility criteria set forth in section\n220.6\nof this Part. An application\nthat meets the eligibility criteria set forth in section\n220.6\nof this Part may then be\nforwarded by the sponsor to the commissioner for further review to determine\nwhether the business meets all of the requirements, as well as the intended\npurpose, of article 21 of the EDL. (1)\n\nWhere\nthe sponsor is a SUNY college or university and proposes to enter into a lease\nwith a term greater than 40 years (including any options to renew) with the\nbusiness applicant for eligible land in a tax-free NY area or for eligible land\nin a tax-free NY area of one million or more square feet, the sponsor must also\nsubmit a copy of the proposed lease to the START-UP NY Approval Board at the\nsame time the application is provided to the commissioner. If the board\ndisapproves of the lease, it must provide to the sponsor a statement of reason\nfor disapproval and suggestions for modifications within 30 days of receipt. The sponsor may then submit a modified lease in accordance with the board's\nsuggestions to the commissioner for review as part of the business application. If the board does not disapprove of the lease within 30 days of receipt, it\nshall be deemed approved by the board and the application shall be deemed ready\nfor review by the commissioner. (f) When forwarding a completed business\napplication to the commissioner, the sponsor must include a certification that\nit will adhere to any and all applicable requirements under article 21 of the\nEDL, article 8 of the Labor Law and article 15-A of the Executive\n\nLaw. (g) An applicant that does not\nmeet the criteria set forth in section\n220.6\nof this Part shall not be\napproved to locate to a tax-free NY area or be accepted into the\nprogram. (h) The commissioner, upon\nreceipt of a complete application from a sponsor, shall conduct a further\nreview to determine whether the business meets all of the requirements, as well\nas the intended purpose, of article 21 of the EDL. The commissioner shall\nconsider, among other things, whether the applicant: (1)\nmeets all of the eligibility criteria set\nforth in section\n220.6\nof this Part; (2)\nhas submitted a complete\napplication; (3)\nhas complied with\nthe application requirements of this section; and\n(4)\ndemonstrated that the business's\nparticipation in the START-UP NY Program will have positive community and\neconomic benefits. (i) The commissioner may reject the application upon a determination that the\napplicant does not meet the eligibility criteria set forth in section\n220.6\nof this Part or any other\nrequirement, as well as the intended purpose, of article 21 of the\nEDL. (j) If the commissioner\nrejects the application, he or she shall provide written notice of such\nrejection to the sponsor. (k) The\ncommissioner may approve the application anytime after receipt; if the\ncommissioner approves the application, the business applicant is deemed\naccepted into the START-UP NY Program and can locate to the sponsor's tax-free\nNY area. If the commissioner does not reject the application within 60 days of\nreceipt, the business applicant is deemed accepted into the START-UP NY Program\nand can locate to the sponsor's tax-free NY area. The commissioner's 60-day\nreview period is suspended pending any review or modification of any proposed\nlease, if any, between a SUNY sponsor and an applicant. The application of the\nbusiness shall constitute the contract between the business and sponsor. The\nsponsor must provide an accepted business with documentation of its acceptance\nin such form as prescribed by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, which\nwill be used to demonstrate such business's eligibility for the tax benefits\nspecified in section\n39\nof the Tax Law. (l) Where the commissioner determines that\nthe number of net new jobs eligible for the personal income tax benefit under\nsection\n39 (e)\nof the Tax Law will exceed the allowable total aggregate net new jobs in the\nyear in which the application is accepted, the business will be given priority\nin the subsequent year and all net new jobs identified in the business\napplication's performance benchmarks will be eligible for the personal income\ntax benefit the following year. (m) At the conclusion of the lease term between the sponsor and the business for\nland or space in a tax-free NY area owned by the sponsor, if applicable, the\nleased land or space and any improvements thereon shall revert to the sponsor, unless the lease is renewed.
