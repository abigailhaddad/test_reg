Tit. 9 § 451.8 - New york safe boating course requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nOnly persons who have received an instructor\ncertification issued by the agency may teach the course. The instructor or the\ncommercial organization must comply with the following requirements: (a) Pre-registration. At least two weeks\nbefore a course is scheduled to begin and before it is advertised the\ninstructor or the commercial organization shall pre-register the course with\nthe agency by providing the following information: dates, times, name of\ntraining facility and its location, names of lead instructor and names of any\nadditional instructors that are scheduled to teach the course, number of\nclassroom sessions, age restrictions (if any), class sizes, total enrollment; instructional fees charged to students (if any) and any other information\nrequired by the agency. (1)\n\nClass sizes may\nvary between 6 and multiples of 30 students per instructor. Requiring 30\nstudents per instructor means that a class of 90 students, for example, would\nrequire a lead certified instructor and 2 additional certified instructors to\nteach it. (2)\n\nAn instructor may not\nregister a class of less than 6 students nor more than 30 students per\ninstructor. If an instructor pre-registers 6 students and at least 2 students\nattend, the instructor may, nevertheless, teach the class. (b) Instruction. A minimum eight hours total\nclassroom instruction taught by an instructor with at least one 10-minute break\nper hour is required. During an all-day session three 10-minute breaks may be\naccumulated and a 30-minute meal substituted for the breaks. The eight hours of\ninstruction must include a review period and the final examination. Instructors-in-training or qualified and recognized experts in the safe boating\nfield may occasionally teach all or part of the lessons but a certified\ninstructor must be present and the lesson plans must be followed. (c) Course materials. Instructors must follow\nthe lesson plans, policies, procedures and use the textbook supplied by the\nagency. These course materials are based on or meet the current requirements of\nthe National Association of State Boating Law Administrators (NASBLA) and the\n\nNew York Safe Boating Instructor Guide issued by the agency. Instructors shall\nnot focus the instruction to cover only points covered on the final examination\nnor provide students with the answers to questions in lieu of following the\nlesson plans. The New York course materials provided by the agency may not be\nused to satisfy any other certificate required by any other commercial or\ngovernmental entity. (d) Final\nexamination. The final examination shall be a closed-book test supplied by the\nagency and administered only after the instructional phase of the course has\nbeen completed. No examinations for other certificates or licenses may be\nadministered or taken during the course. The student must obtain a 76 percent\ngrade on the examination. (e) Receipt. The commercial instructor or commercial organization must provide a\nreceipt to the student for any fee collected. The volunteer instructor must\nprovide a receipt to the student for any charge or donation collected. All\ninstructors must maintain copies of these receipts for five years after\nissuance and make them available to the agency when requested. Alternatively, commercial instructors' receipts may be maintained for five years by their\naffiliated commercial organizations. (f) The agency retains discretionary\nauthority to decline to send course materials and final examinations for a\ncourse to any instructor or commercial organization that the agency determines\nhas not followed or is not following the minimum requirements outlined in this\n\nPart.
