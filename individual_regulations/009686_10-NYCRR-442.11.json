  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.11 - Accrual reporting\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1310 ]\n(a) In order to provide the necessary\ncompleteness, accuracy and meaningfulness in reporting data, accrual basis of\naccounting is required. Accrual accounting is the recognizing and recording of\nthe effects of transactions and other events on the assets and liabilities of\nthe hospital entity in the time periods to which they relate rather than only\nwhen cash is received or paid. For example, the writing off to expense each\nyear of one third of the cost of a three-year insurance policy. We recognize\nthat the immediate implementation of this policy may create a hardship for\nthose hospitals currently on a cash basis. Because of this, a waiver of this\nrule will apply to cash-basis hospitals for the first two reporting periods. At\nthe end of this grace period, all reports must be on the accrual basis. Earlier\ncompliance is encouraged. (b) Requests for waivers of the accrual reporting requirement will be considered\nwhere a State law requires government hospitals to use other than full accrual\naccounting. The fiscal intermediary, after obtaining approval from the Health\n\nCare Financing Agency (HCFA), may grant such a waiver subject to review and\nrevocation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n442.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
