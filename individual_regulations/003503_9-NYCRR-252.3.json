Tit. 9 § 252.3 - Statewide Certification Program - Purpose, scope and applicability\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe purpose of this section is to provide criteria and\nprocedures by which the director makes determinations to approve, deny or\nrevoke the service-disabled veteran-owned business enterprise status of\napplicants and certified business enterprises. This section is applicable to\nthe certification of businesses as service-disabled veteran-owned businesses\nunder article 3 of the Veterans' Services Law. (a) Eligibility criteria. The following standards shall be used to determine whether a business\nenterprise is eligible to be certified as a service-disabled veteran-owned\nbusiness enterprise. (1)\n\nOwnership. For the\npurposes of determining whether an applicant should be granted or denied\nservice-disabled veteran-owned business enterprise status, or whether such\nstatus should be revoked, the following rules regarding ownership shall be\napplied on the basis of information supplied in relation to the application: (i) the contribution of the service-disabled\nveteran-owner must be proportionate to their equity interest in the business\nenterprise, as demonstrated by, but not limited to, contributions of money, property, equipment or expertise; (ii)\nthe business enterprise must demonstrate\nthat it is an independent, real, substantial and continuing entity which has\nbeen actively seeking contracts or orders and regularly and actively performing\nbusiness activities; (iii)\na sole\nproprietorship must be owned by a service-disabled veteran member; (iv)\na partnership or a limited liability\ncompany must demonstrate that service-disabled veteran member(s) have a 51\npercent or greater share of the partnership or limited liability company; and\n(v) a corporation must have\nissued at least 51 percent of its authorized voting and all other stock to\nservice-disabled veteran members or shareholders. (2)\n\nControl. Determinations as to whether\nservice-disabled veteran owners or members control the business enterprise will\nbe made according to the following criteria: (i) Decisions pertaining to the operations of\nthe business enterprise must be made by service-disabled veteran owners or\nmembers claiming ownership of that business enterprise. The following will be\nconsidered in this regard: (a) Service-disabled veteran owners or members must have adequate managerial\nexperience or technical competence in the business enterprise seeking\ncertification. (b) Service-disabled\nveteran owners or members must demonstrate the working knowledge and ability\nneeded to operate the business enterprise. (c) Service-disabled veteran owners or\nmembers must show that they devote time on an ongoing basis to the daily\noperation of the business enterprise. (ii)\n\nArticles of incorporation, corporate\nbylaws, partnership agreements, limited liability company agreements and other\nagreements including, but not limited to, loan agreements, lease agreements, supply agreements, credit agreements or other agreements must permit\nservice-disabled veteran owners or members who claim ownership of the business\nenterprise to make those decisions without restrictions. (iii)\n\nService-disabled veteran owners or\nmembers must demonstrate control of negotiations, signature authority for\npayroll, leases, letters of credit, insurance bonds, banking services and\ncontracts, and other business transactions through production of relevant\ndocuments. (3)\n\nAdditional requirements. The following requirements apply to all applicants\nseeking service-disabled veteran-owned business enterprise status and inclusion\nin the directory of certified businesses: (i) documentation may be required to substantiate the claim of service-disabled\nveteran owner status; (ii)\nan\neligible service-disabled veteran owner applicant must be an independent\nbusiness enterprise. The ownership and control by the service-disabled\nveteran-owner must be real, substantial and continuing and must go beyond the\npro forma ownership of business as reflected in the ownership documents. The\nservice-disabled veteran owner must enjoy the customary incidents of ownership\nand must share in the risks and profits, in proportion with their ownership\ninterest in the business enterprise; (iii)\nwhere the actual management of the\nbusiness enterprise is contracted out to individuals other than\nservice-disabled veteran-owner, the owner must demonstrate that they have the\nultimate power to hire and fire these managers, that they exercise this power\nand make other substantial decisions which reflect control of the business\nenterprise; (iv)\napplicants are\nrequired to conduct business activities for, generally, at least one year prior\nto the application date. Applicants who have been conducting business\nactivities for less than one year, may not be able to provide sufficient\ninformation upon which a certification decision can reasonably be made, and\ntherefore their application may be rejected; and\n(v) the division may require additional\ndocumentation in order to ascertain and/or identify an applicant's ability\nand/or capacity to perform a commercially useful function on certain State\ncontracts. (b) Application intake and\nverification. (1)\n\nApplications for\ncertification may be obtained from and returned to DSDVBD. (2)\nDSDVBD shall date stamp an application\nupon receiving it. If an application is received by the division and required\ndocuments are missing, questions are unanswered or the application is not\nproperly notarized, the division will notify the applicant within 30 days of\nthe initial date stamped on the application of the status of its application\nand any deficiency arising from missing documents, unfinished questions or\ndeficiencies in notarization. An applicant may cure the notice deficiency by\nproviding the division with documents or information requested in the notice of\nstatus and deficiency, within 20 days of the date of receipt of the notice of\nstatus and deficiency.

(7)\n\nAn application shall be deemed complete\nwhen written notice has been sent to the applicant by the division stating that\nits application is complete.
