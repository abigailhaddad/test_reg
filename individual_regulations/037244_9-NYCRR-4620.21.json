  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4620.21 - Card Wheel\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Equipment. A\nwheel of variable size. Around the rim of the wheel's surface are sections, each of which shows the faces of three playing cards bearing different\ncombinations of the cards nine through ace. The wheel has a corresponding\nlayout. (b) The play. (1)\nA player places a wager on one or more\nbetting spaces on the layout and the dealer spins the wheel. When the wheel\nstops, the section in which the indicator arm rests is the winning\ncombination. (2)\n\nIf the player\nplaces a wager on the ace and the wheel stops at nine-ace-king, the payoff odds\nare 1-to-1 since the ace showed only once. If the wheel stops at ace-ace-ten, the payoff odds are 2-to-1 since the ace showed twice. This holds true for all\nthe card faces, e.g., if the player places a wager on the king and the wheel\nstops on king-nine-ace, the payoff odds are 1-to-1. If the wheel stops at\nking-king-king, the payoff odds are 3-to-1. (3)\n\nThe maximum bet shall be $5 or its\nequivalent in chips. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4620.21\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
