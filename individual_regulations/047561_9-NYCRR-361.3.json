  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 361.3 - Applicability and rationale\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part is applicable to the supervision of conditional releasees released\npursuant to section\n70.40 (2)\nof the Penal Law. (b) The rationale for this Part is as\nfollows: (1)\n\nThe activities of the\nconditional releasee are subject to the supervision of a probation officer\nuntil termination or expiration of conditional release. The type and level of\nsupervision of each client should be varied and tailored to the needs of the\nindividual for successful completion of the conditional release and for the\nsafety and protection of society. In order to accomplish this, a system of\ndifferential supervision must be applied based upon a standardized method of\nclassification of the conditional release. (2)\n\nSuch a standardized method of\nclassification serves to determine the required frequency of supervision by\nlevel for a conditional releasee, thereby allowing probation resources to be\nutilized more effectively. (3)\nA\nuniform classification methodology and procedure facilitates consistency in\ndecisionmaking regarding differential supervision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n361.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
