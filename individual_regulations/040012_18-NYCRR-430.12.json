Such records, plans and updates must be made a part of the uniform case record. It is the responsibility of the district to show that the requirements of this\nsection have been met, and a failure to provide evidence that the requirements\nhave been met is deemed equivalent to a failure to make diligent efforts to\nachieve the permanent discharge of the child. (c) General requirements. (1)\n\nConsistency. (i) Standard. The uniform case record must\ndemonstrate consistency among the service needs identified as contributing to\nthe child's need for placement, the goals or outcomes and services planned for\nto meet these needs and the services which are provided to the child, members\nof his or her family or other significant resource persons. For children who\nhave been placed in facilities operated or supervised by the Office of Mental\n\nHealth or the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, the\nservices provided by that facility will be deemed to fulfill the requirements\nof this subparagraph with respect to the child's service needs.

This\ninformation must then be included in the foster child's uniform case record in\naccordance with Part 428 of this Title. (4)\n\nEducation. (i) Standard. The social services district\nwith care and custody or guardianship and custody of a foster child who has\nattained the minimum age for compulsory education under the Education Law is\nresponsible for assuring that the foster child is a full-time elementary or\nsecondary school student or has completed secondary education. For the purpose\nof this paragraph, an\nelementary or secondary school student\nmeans a child who is: (a) enrolled, or in the\nprocess of enrolling, in a school which provides elementary or secondary\neducation, in accordance with the laws where the school is located; (b) instructed in elementary or secondary\neducation at home, in accordance with the laws in which the foster child's home\nis located; (c) in an independent\nstudy elementary or secondary education program, in accordance with the laws in\nwhich the foster child's education program is located, which is administered by\nthe local school or school district; or\n(d) incapable of attending school on a\nfull-time basis due to the foster child's medical condition, which incapability\nis supported by regularly updated information in the child's uniform case\nrecord.

(i) Standard. Districts must plan for and\nmake efforts to facilitate at least biweekly visiting between the child and the\nparents or caretakers to whom the child is to be discharged, unless such\nvisiting is specifically prohibited by court order, or by the transfer of\ncustody agreement, or the child is placed in a facility operated or supervised\nby the Office of Mental Health or Office of Mental Retardation and\n\nDevelopmental Disabilities or because the placement that was chosen pursuant to\nthe standards expressed in section\n430.11\nof this Part makes biweekly\nvisitation an impossibility. In the latter case, the district, at a minimum, must, except as herein after provided, plan for and facilitate monthly visits\nbetween the parent and the child. In the case of children 13 years or older\nplaced by the court as PINS or juvenile delinquents in an institution less than\n100 miles from their homes, and the placement that was chosen, pursuant to the\nstandards expressed in section\n430.11\nof this Part, makes\nbiweekly visitation impossible, the district, at a minimum, must plan for and\nfacilitate quarterly visits between the parent and the child; however, at the\ntime a service plan for discharging the child is developed, appropriate visits, of a greater frequency than quarterly, between the child and the family must be\narranged. In the case of children 13 years or older placed by the court as PINS\nor juvenile delinquents in an institution 100 miles or more from their homes, the standards contained in this subparagraph do not apply. At the time the\nservice plan for discharging the child is developed, appropriate visits between\nthe child and the family must be arranged.

Any act to limit or terminate\nvisiting for children voluntarily placed in foster care must comply with the\nrequirements set forth in section\n431.14\nof this Title; and\n(c) arranging for visits to\noccur in a location that assures the privacy, safety and comfort of the family\nmembers. In no case, except where a family court has ordered supervised\nvisiting, will congregate visits involving members of more than one family\nsatisfy the provisions of this subparagraph. (ii)\n\nDocumentation must include: (a) a visiting plan as required by the\nuniform case record which includes the planned frequency and location of the\nvisits, the name of the child and the names of the persons who are scheduled to\nvisit the child and any arrangements or assistance necessary to facilitate\nbiweekly or monthly visiting, and if supervised visits are planned, the reasons\nfor such supervision; (b) indications in the progress notes or in the visiting plan required by the\nuniform case record of the extent to which visiting has occurred in accordance\nwith the visiting plan and the follow-up efforts which were undertaken when\nscheduled visiting has not occurred; (c) indications in the visiting plan required\nby the uniform case record of the grounds for any attempt to limit or terminate\nvisiting rights, including any documents submitted to the court; and\n(d) where appropriate, a statement that the\nchild has been placed in a facility which is operated or supervised by the\n\nOffice of Mental Health or the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental\n\nDisabilities.

If a parent evinces an intent\nto forgo his or her parental rights and obligations, as manifested by his or\nher failure to visit the child and communicate with the child or agency, although able to do so and not prevented or discouraged from doing so by the\nagency, so that the child is considered an abandoned child pursuant to section\n384-b\nof\nthe Social Services Law, and no mitigating circumstances exist, then an action\nto terminate parental rights must be initiated within 60 days of the completion\nof the assessment and service plan or risk assessment and service plan required\nby the uniform case record which documents these circumstances. (b) Documentation. The assessment and service\nplan or risk assessment and service plan required by the uniform case record\nmust document the evidence of the parent's intent to forgo his or her parental\nrights and obligations. The progress notes must indicate the date that the\npetition to terminate parental rights is filed. (ii)\n\nPermanent neglect. (a) Standard. If a parent has failed for a\nperiod of one year to substantially and continuously or repeatedly maintain\ncontact with or plan for the future of the child, although physically and\nfinancially able to do so, notwithstanding the agency's diligent efforts to\nencourage and strengthen the parental relationship when such efforts will not\nbe detrimental to the child so that the child is considered a permanently\nneglected child pursuant to section\n384-b\nof\nthe Social Services Law, and no mitigating circumstances exist, then an action\nto terminate parental rights must be initiated within 60 days of the completion\nof the assessment and service plan or risk assessment and service plan required\nby the uniform case record which documents these circumstances, as specified in\nsection\n431.9\nof this Title and section\n384-b\nof\nthe Social Services Law. (b) Documentation. The assessment and service plan or risk assessment and service\nplan required by the uniform case record must document the lack of contact or\nthe parents' inability to plan for the child and the district's attempts to\nencourage and strengthen the parental relationship. The progress notes must\nindicate the date that the petition to terminate rights has been\nfiled. (iii)\n\nDischarge\ntime. (a) Standard. Every child with a\npermanency planning goal of return to parents or relatives who has been in care\nfor 15 of the most recent 22 months must be discharged from care or the social\nservices district must comply with the standards for the filing of a petition\nto terminate parental rights as set forth in section\n431.9\nof this Title. (b) Documentation. When the child has been in\ncare for 15 of the most recent 22 months the most recent assessment and service\nplan or risk assessment and service plan required by the uniform case record\nmust show that the child has been discharged from foster care or that a\npetition to terminate parental rights has been filed in accordance with the\nprovisions set forth in section\n431.9\nof this Title, unless the\nplan shows that the child is in care in the home of a relative; or a compelling\nreason why it would not be in the best interest to initiate termination\nproceedings; or that services have not been provided to the family of the child\nwhich are necessary for the safe return of the child to his or her\nfamily. (e) Discharge to adoption. The following requirements pertain to all children in a\nfoster care placement whose permanency planning goal is discharge to\nadoption. (1)\n\nChildren not legally\nfree. (i) Standard. For children who are not\nlegally free for adoption, an action to legally free the child must be\ninitiated within 30 days of the establishment of the permanency planning goal\nof adoption. The child must be freed within 12 months after the establishment\nof the permanency planning goal of adoption. (ii)\n\nDocumentation. The progress notes must\nindicate when the action has been initiated and must include copies of the\npetition and any documents submitted in support of the petition or descriptions\nof the content of the documents. In addition, the date that the child was freed\nmust be noted in the progress notes. If the case does not meet the standard for\nfreeing the child within 12 months, the district will be considered to be\nout-of-compliance with the standard unless, at the time of the first\nrecertification after the 12-month period, the assessment and service plan or\nrisk assessment and service plan required by the uniform case record shows that\na petition to terminate parental rights was filed within 120 days of the date\nthe permanency planning goal of adoption was chosen and the delay was caused\nsolely by the court and not by the district or agency caring for the child, or\nthat the court refuses to terminate parental rights. (2)\n\nChildren legally free. (i) Standard. Children who are legally free\nfor adoption but not in an adoptive home must be placed in an adoptive home\nwithin six months after the child was freed for adoption. For children in\nfacilities operated or supervised by the Office of Mental Health or the Office\nof Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities, the district will be\ndeemed in compliance with this standard during the time the child remains in\nthe facility. If the child is discharged from the facility to a foster care\nplacement, the time in the facility when the child was legally free will be\nconsidered to be part of the total time the child is legally free but not in an\nadoptive home and the documentation requirements specified below will\napply. (ii)\n\nIndian children. An\n\nIndian child who is legally free for adoption must, in the absence of good\ncause to the contrary, be placed in accordance with the preferences set forth\nin subdivision (g) of section\n431.18\nof this Title. (iii)\n(a) Documentation. The progress notes must indicate when the child was placed in\nthe adoptive home, or if the child was not placed in such home within the time\nframe stated in the standard. In instances where a handicapped or hard-to-place\nchild was not placed in an adoptive home within six months, the progress notes\nmust indicate that inquiry was made of the adoptive placement registry within\nthree months of the date the child became legally freed and the results of such\ninquiry. The first assessment and service plan or risk assessment and service\nplan required by the uniform case record after the six- month period must\nindicate that an attempt will be made to obtain a subsidized adoptive placement\nfor the child, or record the reason the district believes that subsidy will not\nbe required to complete the adoptive placement before the end of the 12th\nmonth. Failure to place the child in an adoptive home within 12 months from the\ndate he or she was freed constitutes noncompliance with this standard, unless\nthe child's permanency planning goal, as recorded on the assessment and service\nplan or risk assessment and service plan required by the uniform case record is\nother than discharge to adoption, or unless the State Commissioner of Social\n\nServices, or his or her representative, has approved a continuation of the\nefforts to place the child in an adoptive home. Such approval will not be given\nfor more than 12 months without a subsequent review of the case by the State\n\nCommissioner of Social Services or his or her representative. If an agreement\nto adopt the child has been signed by the prospective adoptive parents, and the\nprospective parents then refuse to maintain the child in the home or otherwise\nto complete the adoptive process, as documented in the most recent assessment\nand service plan or risk assessment and service plan required by the uniform\ncase record, the date of that refusal is deemed to be the date on which the\nchild was freed. During the time the child is in a facility operated or\nsupervised by the Office of Mental Health or Office of Mental Retardation and\n\nDevelopmental Disabilities, the documentation requirements of this subparagraph\nwill be deemed to have been met for such child. (b) Each social services official who places\nan Indian child in an adoptive home must maintain a record of such placement\nwhich evidences the efforts made to comply with the order of preference set\nforth in section\n431.18\n(g) of this\n\nTitle. Information concerning efforts by social services districts to comply\nwith the order of preference contained in the case record must be made\navailable to the child's Indian tribe and the Secretary of Interior upon\nrequest. (iv)\n\nFor\npurposes of this paragraph, the term\n\nIndian child\nwill have\nthe meaning which is given to this term by section\n431.18\nof this Title. (3)\n\nChildren in adoptive\nplacement. (i) Standard. For children who are\nlegally free, in an adoptive home, but whose adoptions are not yet final, such\nadoptions must be finalized within 12 months after the child is placed in an\nadoptive home. (ii)\n\nDocumentation. The progress notes must indicate the date of finalization or, if the child's\nadoption was not finalized in the required time frame, the district will be\nconsidered to be out-of-compliance with the standard, unless, at the time of\nthe first recertification after the six-month period, the assessment and\nservice plan or risk assessment and service plan required by the uniform case\nrecord shows that the delay was caused solely by the court, and not by the\ndistrict or agency caring for the child, or that the adoptive parents have\ndelayed finalization. (f) Another planned living arrangement\nwith a permanency resource. Another planned living arrangement with a permanency\nresource is a permanency planning goal to assist foster care youth in their\ntransition to self-sufficiency by connecting the youth to an adult permanency\nresource, equipping the youth with life skills and, upon discharge, connecting\nthe youth with any needed community and/or specialized services. An adult\npermanency resource is a caring committed adult who has been determined by a\nsocial services district to be an appropriate and acceptable resource for a\nyouth and is committed to providing emotional support, advice and guidance to\nthe youth and to assist the youth as the youth makes the transition from foster\ncare to responsible adulthood. The following requirements pertain to all\nchildren in a foster care placement whose permanency goal is discharge to\nanother planned living arrangement with a permanency resource and, where\nindicated, to children deemed to be discharged to another planned living\narrangement with a permanency resource or deemed to have a goal of discharge to\nanother planned living arrangement with a permanency resource. For the purposes\nof this subdivision only, a child deemed to be discharged to another\nplanned living arrangement with a permanency resource\nmeans a child 16\nyears of age or older who has resided in foster care for at least 12 months\nwithin the past 36 months and who has been discharged to parents or relatives. For the purposes of this subdivision only, a child deemed to have a\ngoal of another planned living arrangement with a permanency resource\nmeans a child 16 years of age or older who resided in foster care for at least\n12 months within the past 36 months and who has a goal of discharge to parents\nor relatives or a goal of adoption. (1)\n\nSetting of goal. (i) Standard. The child is 16 years of age or\nolder for this goal to be established and it is determined to be in the child's\nbest interests that he or she remain in foster care and not return to his or\nher parents or be adopted until the child reaches the age of 18. No other child\nmay have a goal of discharge to another planned living arrangement with a\npermanency resource. (ii)\n\nDocumentation. The first assessment and service plan required by the uniform\ncase record at the time of the selection of the permanency planning goal must\nindicate the reasons for choosing this goal rather than \"discharge to parents\nor relatives\" or \"discharge to adoption,\" and must summarize efforts to\naccomplish either or both of these permanency goals before this goal was\nselected and document a compelling reason why it would not be in the best\ninterests of the child to be returned home, placed for adoption, placed with a\nlegal guardian or placed with a fit and willing relative.

(a) The district must ensure the provision to\nall children with a goal of discharge to another planned living arrangement\nwith a permanency resource, or deemed to have a goal of discharge to another\nplanned living arrangement with a permanency resource, of structured programs\nof vocational training and independent living skills, including at least two\ndays per year of formalized group instruction in independent living skills. Vocational training includes, but is not limited to, training programs in a\nmarketable skill or trade or formal on-the-job training. Children enrolled in\nsecondary education, taking academic courses and receiving at least passing\ngrades which if maintained would lead to graduation prior to the child's 20th\nbirthday, and children enrolled in full-time study at an accredited college or\nuniversity are deemed to meet the requirement for vocational training. Vocational training must begin at the time the goal of discharge to another\nplanned living arrangement with a permanency resource is selected or deemed to\nbe selected or by the child's 16th birthday, whichever is later, and must\ncontinue without interruption until the child is discharged to another planned\nliving arrangement with a permanency resource, unless the child is employed in\na paying job for which such child's vocational training has prepared him or\nher, or is employed in a paying job at an hourly rate which would provide\nincome, if the child was employed on a full-time basis, equal to or greater\nthan 150 percent of the poverty level for a family of one as established by the\n\nFederal Department of Health and Human Services, or has passed a test approved\nor administered by the agency, school, or firm providing the training, or has\notherwise successfully completed a course of vocational training as evidenced\nby a certificate or some other document demonstrating completion. Independent\nliving skills include formalized instruction, including supervised performance\nin job search, career counseling, apartment finding, budgeting, shopping, cooking, and house cleaning. Instruction in these skills must begin at the time\nthe goal is selected or by the child's 14th birthday, whichever is later, and\nmust continue without interruption until the child is discharged, unless the\nchild has demonstrated competency in all of the above skills, either through a\ntest approved by the department or through an assessment based on observation\nof the child's performance; in either case, the child's on-going application of\nthose skills must be deemed to meet the standard. The vocational training\nrequirements of this subparagraph cannot apply where the child demonstrates an\ninability to participate in and benefit from vocational training because of the\nchild's inability to read or compute at an appropriate grade level. Where a\nchild is found to be unable to benefit from such training, remedial education\nmust be provided to prepare the child to participate in and benefit from\nvocational training. In the case of children who have been placed in facilities\noperated or supervised by the Office of Mental Health or Office of Mental\n\nRetardation and Developmental Disabilities, the services provided by that\nfacility are deemed to fulfill the requirements of the standard contained in\nthis subparagraph. (b) Subject to\nthe availability of State and Federal funds therefor, the district must ensure\nthat a monthly independent living stipend is regularly provided to each child\n16 years of age or older who has, or is deemed to have, a goal of discharge to\nanother planned living arrangement with a permanency resource and who, according to his or her case plan, is actively participating in independent\nliving services. The independent living stipend is to be provided in addition\nto the regular allowance the child is entitled to receive pursuant to section\n441.12\n(a) of this\n\nTitle. The purposes for providing an independent living stipend are: to give\nthe child incentive to participate in independent living services, to teach the\nchild to manage money, and to provide the child with a means to accumulate\nsavings to assist him or her in the transition to independent living. The\namount of the monthly stipend must be in accordance with the following\nschedule: Age\n\nMonthly stipend\n16\n$20.00\n17\n25.00\n18\n30.00\n19\n35.00\n20\n40.00\n\nDepending upon the child's financial needs and abilities, the district must pay the entire monthly stipend in one lump sum payment or in\ntwo or more smaller payments spread over the month. Stipend payments to the\nchild must be suspended for any period of time that the child, according to his\nor her case plan, is not actively participating in independent living services. A child placed in a facility operated or supervised by the Office of Mental\n\nHealth or the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities is\nnot eligible to receive an independent living stipend. (ii)\n\nDocumentation. (a) Each assessment and service plan required\nunder Part 428 of this Title must show the type, location, duration, and\nintensity of the vocational training and instruction in independent living\nskills being provided to the child, as well as the level of achievement the\nchild has attained. If the required vocational training and/or instruction in\nindependent living skills has not been provided, the case record must document\nthat the reason for the failure to complete the training was because of the\nchild's unwillingness to cooperate, or the child's employment in a job as\nreferenced in clause (\na\n) of subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, or the child's passing of a test displaying competence in relevant\njob skills and independent living skills, or the child's inability to\nparticipate in and benefit from vocational training because of educational\ndeficiencies. If the reason for the failure to complete the training or\ninstruction is the child's unwillingness to cooperate, the case record must\ndocument the efforts made by the district to encourage participation by the\nchild in the training or instruction. Any assessment that the child cannot\nparticipate in and benefit from vocational training because of the lack of\nreading or computation skills must be contained in the uniform case record. The\nrecord must contain the date of the assessment of educational deficiencies, a\nplan of remediation including the remedial services provided to the child and\nthe date of anticipated completion of the plan which under no circumstances may\nbe the same as or subsequent to the date of planned discharge. This plan must\nbe designed to enable the child to participate in and benefit from vocational\ntraining. Information concerning the services which are provided to children in\nfacilities operated or supervised by the Office of Mental Health or Office of\n\nMental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities and which is forwarded by\nsuch facilities to the social services district responsible for maintaining the\nuniform case record must be included in the uniform case record and will be\ndeemed to fulfill the documentation requirements of this\nsubparagraph. (b) Each assessment\nand service plan, reassessment and service plan review also must show the\namount and frequency of the independent living stipend payments made to the\nchild and the child's active participation in independent living services as\noutlined in the case plan. If the child did not receive an independent living\nstipend for any period of time, the case record must document the reason the\nchild did not receive a stipend or the reason that the stipend was suspended. Such documentation must include a description of how and why the child was not\nactively participating in independent living services as outlined in the case\nplan or that the child was placed in a facility operated or supervised by the\n\nOffice of Mental Health or the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental\n\nDisabilities. (3)\n\nDischarge. (i) Standards. (a) For each child discharged to another\nplanned living arrangement with a permanency resource, the district must\nidentify any persons, services or agencies which would help the child maintain\nand support himself or herself and must assist the child to establish contact\nwith such agencies, service providers or persons by making referrals and by\ncounseling the child about these referrals prior to discharge. This must\ninclude efforts to assist the child to reestablish contacts with parents, former foster parents or other persons significant to the child. (b) No child can be discharged to another\nplanned living arrangement with a permanency resource, unless such child has\nreceived written notice of such discharge at least 90 days prior to the date of\ndischarge and has had the goal of another planned living arrangement with a\npermanency resource continuously for a six-month period immediately prior to\ndischarge. This notice requirement does not apply where the child has\nvoluntarily departed from the foster care placement without the consent of the\ndistrict and has been absent from said placement for 60 days. (c) No child may be discharged to another\nplanned living arrangement with a permanency resource, unless the child has a\nresidence other than a shelter for adults, shelter for families, single-room\noccupancy hotel or any other congregate living arrangement which houses more\nthan 10 unrelated persons and there is a reasonable expectation that the\nresidence will remain available to the child for at least the first 12 months\nafter discharge. This requirement does not apply to a child who is a member of\nthe military or job corps or who is a full-time student in a post-secondary\neducational institution or where the child has voluntarily departed from the\nfoster care placement without the consent of the district and has been absent\nfrom said placement for 60 days. (ii)\n\nDocumentation. (a) Documentation includes goals or outcomes\nand services in the service plan and a summary by the district of the efforts\nmade and their results in the assessment and service plan required by the\nuniform case record. (b) A copy of\nthe written notice of discharge must be maintained in the case record until the\nchild attains the age of 21, showing the date the child received the notice. In\naddition, the child's service plans prepared pursuant to Part 428 of this Title\nmust show that the child has had the goal of independent living continuously\nfor a six-month period immediately prior to discharge. If the notice is not\nreceived by the child because the child is voluntarily absent from the foster\ncare placement without the consent of the district, the case record must\ndocument when the child left the foster care placement, the voluntary nature of\nthe absence of the child, the absence of consent by the district and the\nefforts made by the district to make contact with the child to encourage the\nreturn of the child to the placement. (c) The plan amendment or service plan\nrequired by the uniform case record must include a description of the living\narrangements secured for the child, together with an assessment of the\npermanency of those arrangements. If the child is discharged without the\ndistrict securing living arrangements for the child, the case record must\ndocument that the reason for the failure to secure such arrangement has been\nthat the child is a member of the military or job corps or a full-time student\nin a post-secondary educational institution or has voluntarily departed from\nthe foster care placement without the district's consent and has been absent\nfrom the placement for 60 days. (4)\n\nPost-discharge. (i) Standards. (a) Every child discharged to another planned\nliving arrangement with a permanency resource and every child deemed to have\nbeen discharged to another planned living arrangement with a permanency\nresource must remain in a status of trial discharge for at least six months\nafter discharge and must remain in the custody of the local commissioner during\nthe entire period of trial discharge. Trial discharge may continue at the\ndiscretion of the district up to the age of 21 if the reassessment and service\nplan review indicates either the need for continued custody or a likelihood\nthat the child may need to return to foster care. During the period of trial\ndischarge, the district must provide after-care services to the child, including casework contacts with the child, with the number of face-to-face\ncontacts and in-home contacts equal to those required for that child pursuant\nto section\n431.16\n(c) of this\n\nTitle during the six months immediately preceding the child's discharge. In\naddition, after-care services include the provision of services consistent with\nthe service needs of the child identified in the uniform case record which\nwould enable the child to live independently after he or she is discharged from\ncare. In the event that the child becomes homeless during the period of trial\ndischarge, the district must assist the child to obtain housing equivalent to\nthat authorized by clause (\nc\n) of this subparagraph. Under no\ncircumstances may a district refer or place a child during the 30-day period\nfollowing the child's becoming homeless in a shelter for adults, shelter for\nfamilies, single-room occupancy hotel, or any other congregate living\narrangement which houses more than 10 unrelated persons. If appropriate housing\nis not available within 30 days of the date the child becomes homeless, the\ndistrict must place the child in a suitable foster boarding home, agency\nboarding home, group home or institution consistent with section\n430.11\nof this Part. The\nprovisions of this clause relating to trial discharge does not apply where a\ncourt order terminates the district's custody of the child or where the child\nreaches the age of 21. (b) After\nthe district's custody of the child has been terminated whether by court order\nor by the district's own action, the district must maintain supervision of the\nchild until the child is 21 years of age, where the child has been discharged\nto another planned living arrangement with a permanency resource or is deemed\nto have been discharged to another planned living arrangement with a permanency\nresource and has permanently left the home of his or her parents or relatives\nprior to the termination of the district's custody. Supervision includes at\nleast monthly contact with the child, unless the child has maintained adequate\nhousing and income continuously for the past six months, in which case at least\nquarterly contacts shall occur, either face-to-face or by telephone. Where\nmonthly contacts are required, face-to-face contacts on a quarterly basis must\noccur with the remaining contacts being either face-to-face or by telephone. This requirement of quarterly face-to-face contacts does not apply to children\nliving 50 miles outside of the district. In all cases, the district must\nprovide referral to needed services, including income and housing services, with sufficient follow-up efforts to ensure that the child has begun to receive\nthe services for which he or she was referred. The contact requirements of this\nclause must be satisfied when the child has refused contact or cannot be\nlocated during a 60-day period in which two face-to-face or telephone contacts\nand one in-home contact have not been successful. The contact requirements\nmandated by this clause must resume when the child is located and desires to\ncooperate with the district. (c) Nothing in this subdivision mandates the participation of a child in the status\nof trial discharge or supervision. Such participation is contingent upon the\nconsent of the child. (ii)\n\nDocumentation. (a) The requirements of the uniform case\nrecord, as established in Part 428 of this Title, will apply until the\ndistrict's custody of the child has been terminated, either by court order or\nby the district's own action. Each reassessment and service plan review or\nafter the child's discharge must show whether the child remains in the custody\nof the local commissioner, the need for continued custody, the number and\nlocation of casework contacts with the child, the child's current living\narrangements and service needs including, but not limited to whether the child\nhas become homeless, the services provided during the past six months, including but not limited to housing and income services, and the services to\nbe provided during the next six months. If the required number of casework\ncontacts with the child has not been made, the case record must document that\nthe primary reason for the failure to complete the contacts has been the\nchild's unwillingness to cooperate with the district. The case record must also\ndocument the efforts made by the district to make contact with the child and to\nencourage participation in the district's supervisory functions. (b) After termination of the district's\ncustody of the child, whether by court order or by the district's own action, progress notes must be maintained which show the number and type of contacts\nwith the child, the services and service providers to whom the child has been\nreferred, and whether the child actually received services. If the required\nnumber of contacts with the child has not been made, the case record must\ndocument the efforts made by the district to contact the child and to encourage\nthe child to cooperate with the district.
