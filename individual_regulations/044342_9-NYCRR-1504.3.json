  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1504.3 - Water supply\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as\notherwise stated in subdivision (b) below, the water supply for new sprinkler\nsystems may be tapped from the domestic water supply system provided the supply\nto the sprinkler system is of adequate pressure, capacity and reliability and\nprovided that the following requirements are met: (1)\n\nThe sprinkler connection shall be made to\na main or branch from a main with no intervening means of shut-off from the\nmain. (2)\n\nWater pressure from the\nmain shall be sufficient to maintain at least 12 pounds per square inch at the\nhighest sprinkler head. Where the water pressure is insufficient to maintain 12\npounds per square inch at the highest head but is sufficient to maintain at\nleast five pounds per square inch at such head, an automatic booster pump shall\nbe used as an auxiliary means of furnishing the required supply. The booster\npump shall be caused to operate when the flow of water through any portion of\nthe sprinkler piping is equal to or greater than that flowing from a single\nsprinkler head. The booster pump shall be capable of supplying sufficient water\nfor a period of at least 20 minutes to at least 25 per cent of the total number\nof sprinkler heads at a pressure of at least 12 pounds per square inch at the\nhighest sprinkler head. Such booster pump shall be so connected as not to\nrestrict the flow of water in the system. (b) Where the domestic water supply system is\ninadequate to supply a new sprinkler system, the department shall require an\nalternate arrangement for the sprinkler system water supply. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n1504.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
