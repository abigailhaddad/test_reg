  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 30-2.4 - Standards and criteria for conducting annual professional performance reviews of classroom teachers under Education Law section 3012-d\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Annual professional performance reviews\nconducted under this section shall differentiate teacher effectiveness\nresulting in a teacher being rated highly effective, effective, developing or\nineffective based on multiple measures in two categories: the student\nperformance category and the teacher observation category. (b) Student performance\ncategory. The student performance category shall have one mandatory\nsubcomponent and one optional subcomponent as follows: (1)\n\nMandatory first subcomponent. (i) For a teacher whose course ends in a\n\nState-created or administered test for which there is a State-provided growth\nmodel and at least 50 percent of a teacher's students are covered under the\n\nState-provided growth measure, such teacher shall have a State-provided growth\nscore based on such model; and\n(ii)\nfor a teacher whose course does not end in a State-created or administered test\nor where less than 50 percent of the teacher's students are covered by a\n\nState-provided growth measure, such teacher shall have a student learning\nobjective (SLO) developed and approved by his/her superintendent or his or her\ndesignee, using a form prescribed by the commissioner, consistent with the SLO\nprocess determined or developed by the commissioner, that results in a student\ngrowth score; provided that, for any teacher whose course ends in a\n\nState-created or administered assessment for which there is no State-provided\ngrowth model, such assessment must be used as the underlying assessment for\nsuch SLO. Provided, however, that during the 2015-16 school year, while the\ndepartment transitions to a new computer based examination, the district shall\ndetermine whether to use the New York State Alternate Assessment (NYSAA) as the\nunderlying assessment for such SLO. In instances where a district determines\nnot to use the NYSAA, the district must determine whether to use SLOs based on\na list of approved student assessments, or a district- or-BOCES-wide or school-\nor program-wide group, team, or linked results based on State/Regents\nassessments, or other assessments approved by the department, as defined by the\ncommissioner in guidance. The SLO process determined by the commissioner shall\ninclude a minimum growth target of one year of expected growth, as determined\nby the superintendent or his or her designee. Such targets, as determined by\nthe superintendent or his or her designee, may take the following\ncharacteristics into account: poverty, students with disabilities, English\nlanguage learners status and prior academic history. SLOs shall include the\nfollowing SLO elements, as defined by the commissioner in guidance: (a) student population; (b) learning content; (c) interval of instructional time; (d) evidence; (e) baseline; (f) target; (g) criteria for rating a teacher highly\neffective, effective, developing or ineffective (HEDI); and\n(h) rationale; (iii)\nfor a teacher whose course does not end\nin a State-created or administered test or where a State-provided growth\nmeasure is not determined, districts may determine whether to use SLOs based on\na list of approved student assessments, or a district or BOCES-wide or school\nor program-wide group, team, or linked results based on State/Regents\nassessments or other student assessments approved by the department, as defined\nby the commissioner in guidance; (iv)\ndistricts shall develop back-up SLOs for\nall teachers whose courses end in a State created or administered test for\nwhich there is a State-provided growth model, to use in the event that no\n\nState-provided growth score can be generated for such\nteachers. (2)\n\nOptional\nsecond subcomponent. A district may locally select a second measure that shall\nbe applied in a consistent manner, to the extent practicable, across the\ndistrict based on State/Regents assessments or State-designed supplemental\nassessments and be either: (i) a second\n\nState-provided growth score on a state-created or administered test; provided\nthat the State-provided growth measure is different than that used in the\nrequired subcomponent of the student performance category, which may include\none or more of the following measures: (a) a\nteacher-specific growth score computed by the State based on percentage of\nstudents who achieve a State-determined level of growth (\ne.g., percentage of students whose growth is above the median for similar\nstudents); (b) school-wide growth\nresults based on a State-provided school-wide growth score for all students\nattributable to the school who took the State English language arts or math\nassessment in grades 4-8; or\n(c) district- or BOCES-wide or school-wide, group, team, or linked growth results\nusing available State-provided growth scores that are locally-computed; or\n(ii)\na growth score\nbased on a State-designed supplemental assessment, calculated using a\n\nState-provided or approved growth model. Such growth score may include\ndistrict- or BOCES-wide or school- or program-wide group, team, or linked\nresults where the State-approved growth model is capable of generating such a\nscore. (3)\n\nAll\n\nState-provided or approved growth model scores must control for poverty, students with disabilities, English language learners status and prior academic\nhistory. For SLOs, these characteristics may be taken into account through the\nuse of targets based on one year of expected growth, as determined by the\nsuperintendent or his or her designee. (4)\n\nThe district shall measure student growth\nusing the same measure(s) of student growth for all classroom teachers in a\ncourse and/or grade level in a district. (c) Weighting of subcomponents within\nstudent performance category. (1)\n\nIf a\ndistrict does not locally select to use the optional second student growth\nsubcomponent, then the mandatory subcomponent shall be weighted at 100\npercent. (2)\n\nIf the optional second\nstudent growth subcomponent is selected, then the mandatory subcomponent shall\nbe weighted at a minimum of 50 percent and the optional second subcomponent\nshall be weighted at no more than 50 percent. (3)\n\nEach measure used in the student\nperformance category (State provided growth score, SLOs, State-designed\nsupplemental assessments) must result in a score between 0 and 20. The State\nwill generate scores of 0-20 for measures using a State-provided growth score. Districts shall calculate scores for SLOs in accordance with the minimum\npercentages prescribed in the table below; provided however that for teachers\nwith courses with small \"n\" sizes as defined by the commissioner in guidance, districts shall calculate scores for SLOs using a methodology prescribed by the\ncommissioner in guidance and for teachers in the City School District of the\n\nCity of New York, districts shall calculate scores for SLOs using the\nmethodology approved by the commissioner in its APPR plan. For all other\nmeasures that are not State-provided growth measures, scores of 0-20 shall be\ncomputed locally in accordance with the State provided or approved growth model\nused.

(1)\n\nMultiple\nstudent performance measures shall be combined using a weighted average\npursuant to subdivision (c) of this section to produce an overall student\nperformance category score of 0 to 20. Based on such score, an overall student\nperformance category rating shall be derived from the table below: Overall Student Performance Category Score and\n\nRating\n\nMinimum\n\nMaximum\nH\n18\n20\nE\n15\n17\nD\n13\n14\nI\n0\n12\n(2)\n\nTeacher observation category. The\nobservation category for teachers shall be based on at least two observations; one of which must be unannounced. (i) Two\nmandatory subcomponents. (a) one observation\nshall be conducted by a principal or other trained administrator; and\n(b) a second observation shall be conducted\nby either one or more impartial independent trained evaluator(s) selected and\ntrained by the district or in cases where a hardship waiver is granted by the\ndepartment pursuant to subclause (\n1\n) of this clause, a second\nobservation shall be conducted by one or more evaluators selected and trained\nby the district, who are different than the evaluator(s) who conducted the\nevaluation pursuant to clause (\na\n) of this paragraph; or in\ncases where a hardship waiver is granted by the department pursuant to\nsubclause (2) of this clause, a second observation shall be conducted as\nprescribed in subclause (2) of this clause. An independent trained evaluator\nmay be employed within the district, but may not be assigned to the same school\nbuilding as the teacher being evaluated; (1)\na rural school district, as defined by the commissioner in guidance, or a\nschool district with only one registered school pursuant to section\n100.18\nof the commissioner's\nregulations may apply to the department for a hardship waiver on an annual\nbasis, in a timeframe and manner prescribed by the commissioner, if due to the\nsize and limited resources of the school district, it is unable to obtain an\nindependent evaluator within a reasonable proximity without an undue burden to\nthe school district; (2)\ncommencing\nwith the 2016-2017 school year, a school district may apply to the department\nfor a hardship waiver on an annual basis, in a timeframe and manner prescribed\nby the commissioner, if the school district believes that compliance with this\nclause would create an undue burden on the school district in one or more of\nthe following areas: compliance with the independent evaluator requirement\nwould result in financial hardship; the district lacks professionally trained\nstaff to comply with the independent evaluator requirement; the district has a\nlarge number of teachers; and/or compliance with the independent evaluator\nrequirement could impact safety and management of a building. A hardship waiver\ngranted by the department under this subclause shall excuse, but not prohibit, school districts from conducting observations by impartial independent trained\nevaluators for teachers who received a rating of highly effective, effective, or developing in the preceding school year (\ne.g., school\ndistricts would be excused, but not prohibited, from conducting observations by\nimpartial independent trained evaluators for the 2016-2017 school year for\nteachers who receive a rating of highly effective, effective, or developing for\nthe 2015-2016 school year; school districts would be required to conduct\nobservations by impartial independent trained evaluators for the 2016-2017\nschool year for, at a minimum, teachers who receive a rating of ineffective for\nthe 2015-2016 school year). For teachers who are excused from the impartial\nindependent trained evaluator requirement pursuant to a hardship waiver granted\nby the department under this subclause, school districts shall conduct a second\nobservation, provided that such second observation may be conducted by the\nbuilding principal/supervisor or any individual selected and trained by the\nschool district. The two observations for such teachers could be performed by\nthe same individual. As part of its hardship waiver request, a school district\nshall submit a plan for conducting observations by the building principal or\nother individual selected and trained by the school district in lieu of the\nimpartial independent trained evaluator subcomponent. For the other teachers in\nthe district who must still receive a second observation by an impartial, independent trained evaluator (teachers who, at a minimum, received an\nineffective rating in the preceding school year), the district must submit a\nplan for conducting such observations. Once a hardship waiver is approved by\nthe department, it shall be considered part of the school district's annual\nprofessional performance review plan for such school year. (ii)\n\nOptional third subcomponent. The observations category may include a third optional subcomponent based on\nclassroom observations conducted by a trained peer teacher rated effective or\nhighly effective on his or her overall rating in the prior school year from the\nsame school or from another school in the district. (iii)\n\nFrequency and duration of observations. The frequency and duration of observations shall be determined\nlocally. (iv)\n\nAll observations must\nbe conducted using a teacher practice rubric approved by the commissioner\npursuant to a request for qualification (RFQ) process, unless the district has\nan approved variance from the commissioner. (a) Variance for existing rubrics. A variance\nmay be granted to a district that seeks to use a rubric that is either a close\nadaptation of a rubric on the approved list, or a rubric that was\nself-developed or developed by a third-party, upon a finding by the\ncommissioner that the rubric meets the criteria described in the request for\nqualification and the district has demonstrated that it has made a significant\ninvestment in the rubric and has a history of use that would justify continuing\nthe use of that rubric. (b) Variance for use of new innovative rubrics. A variance may be granted to a\ndistrict that seeks to use a newly developed rubric, upon a finding by the\ncommissioner that the rubric meets the criteria described in the RFQ, has\ndemonstrated how it will ensure inter-rater reliability and the rubric's\nability to provide differentiated results over time. (v) All observations for a teacher for the\nschool year must use the same approved rubric; provided that districts may\nlocally determine whether to use different rubrics for teachers who teach\ndifferent grades and/or subjects during the school year. (vi)\n\nAt least one of the mandatory\nobservations must be unannounced. (vii)\n\nObservations may occur either live or\nvia recorded video, as determined locally. (viii)\n\nNothing in this Subpart shall be\nconstrued to limit the discretion of a board of education, superintendent of\nschools or a principal or other trained administrator to conduct observations\nin addition to those required by this section for non-evaluative\npurposes. (ix)\n\nObservations must be\nbased only on observable rubric subcomponents. The evaluator may select a\nlimited number of observable rubric subcomponents for focus within a particular\nobservation, so long as all observable teaching standards/domains are addressed\nacross the total number of annual observations. (x) New York State teaching standards/domains\nthat are part of the rubric but not observable during the classroom observation\nmay be observed during any optional pre-observation conference or\npost-observation review or other natural conversations between the teacher and\nthe evaluator and incorporated into the observation score. (xi)\n\nPoints shall not be allocated based on\nany artifacts, unless such artifact constitutes evidence of an otherwise\nobservable rubric subcomponent (\ne.g., a lesson plan viewed\nduring the course of the observation may constitute evidence of professional\nplanning). (xii)\n\nEach subcomponent\nof the observation category shall be evaluated on a 1-4 scale based on a\n\nState-approved rubric aligned to the New York State teaching standards and an\noverall score for the observation category shall be generated between 1-4. Such\nsubcomponent scores shall incorporate all evidence collected and observed over\nthe course of the school year. Scores for each subcomponent of the observation\ncategory shall be combined using a weighted average pursuant to subparagraph\n(xiv) of this paragraph, producing an overall observation category score\nbetween 1-4. In the event that a teacher earns a score of 1 on all rated\ncomponents of the practice rubric across all observations, a score of 0 will be\nassigned. (xiii)\n\nWeighting of\nsubcomponents within teacher observation category. The weighting of the\nsubcomponents within the teacher observation category shall be established\nlocally within the following constraints: (a) observations conducted by a principal or other trained administrator shall be\nweighted at a minimum of 80 percent; (b) observations conducted by independent\nimpartial observer(s), or other evaluators selected by the district if a\nhardship waiver is granted, shall be weighted at a minimum of 10\npercent; (c) if a district selects\nto use the optional third observation subcomponent, then the weighting assigned\nto the optional observations conducted by peers shall be established locally\nwithin the constraints outlined in clauses (\na\n) and\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph. (xiv)\n\nOverall rating on the teacher\nobservation category. The overall observation score calculated pursuant to\nsubparagraphs (xii) and (xiii) shall be converted into an overall rating, using\ncut scores determined locally for each rating category; provided that such cut\nscores shall be consistent with the permissible ranges identified below: Overall Observation Category Score and\n\nRating\n\nMin\n\nMax\nH\n3.5 to 3.75\n4.0\nE\n2.5 to 2.75\n3.49 to 3.74\nD\n1.5 to 1.75\n2.49 to 2.74\nI\n0\n1.49 to 1.74\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
