A separate flash\naudit log report is recommended; and\n(c) all modifications to the\ndownload-executable or flash file or files shall be submitted to and licensed\nindependent testing laboratory for approval. Such approved laboratory shall\nperform a flash download to the system existing at such approved laboratory and\nverify operation.
