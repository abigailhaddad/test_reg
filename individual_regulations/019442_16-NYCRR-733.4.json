  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 733.4 - Definition of record media\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the\npurpose of this Part, the data constituting the records listed in the schedule\nof records and periods of retention may be retained in any generally accepted\nelectronic or photographic storage medium, provided the medium selected has a\nstandard life expectancy greater than or equal to the specified retention\nperiod. Storage media can include, but are not limited to: paper, microfilm, magnetic disk, magnetic tape, optical disk, CD-ROM, DVD, etc. It is the\nresponsibility of the public utility or municipality to ensure that the storage\nmedium is consistent with the prescribed retention period and all conditions\nfor proper storage are met to insure the protection and retrievability of the\ndata/information in the chosen format. However, records supporting plant cost\nshall be retained in their original form unless microfilmed (See section\n733.10\nof this Part for periods of\nretention). Media regeneration to achieve the full length of period retention\nwill be allowed at the discretion of the utility, provided the utility follows\nappropriate sections in these regulations. (b) If the storage medium of the record\nretained is other than a readable paper copy, then reader and/or printer\nequipment and related printout programs, if required, shall be provided by the\nutility for data reference. (c) A\nstorage medium may be changed based on the judgement of the utility, if\nsubsequent conditions such as improved media life expectancy and the remaining\nretention period permits a change in the media forms, the public utility or\nmunicipality may convert to another medium, provided the certification\nprocesses described in section\n733.5\nof this Part are observed\nand data referencing capability is maintained. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n733.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
