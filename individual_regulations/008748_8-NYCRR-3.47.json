(c) Undergraduate degrees. Undergraduate\ndegrees shall be distinguished, as follows, by the minimum amount of liberal\narts content required for each degree.

(d) Graduate\ndegrees. To provide for clear-cut distinctions between graduate academic and\nprofessional degrees, the following policies have been established. (1)\n\nAcademic degrees. Graduate academic\ndegree programs consist of advanced studies in an academic discipline. They\nmust have as their purpose contributions to knowledge of the subject matter, rather than specific applications of knowledge to professional practices. Master's degree programs of this type may be terminal in nature or may also\nprovide an introduction to research and advanced study at the doctoral level. Such programs emphasize theory and are not primarily designed as preparation\nfor professional careers. Graduate academic degree programs leading to the\ndoctorate shall include research that prepares the graduate student for a life\nof scholarship in an academic discipline. The following are the only degrees\nappropriately conferred upon the completion of an academic graduate program: Master of Arts (A.M. or M.A.)\n\nMaster of Science (M.S.)\n\nMaster of Philosophy (M.Phil.)\n\nDoctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)\n\nThe master of philosophy is intermediate between the other\nacademic master's degrees and the doctor of philosophy. It is awarded to\ncandidates in one of the institution's own Ph.D. programs and for completion of\nall requirements for the Ph.D. except the dissertation. (2)\n\nProfessional degrees. Graduate\nprofessional degree programs must be comprised of advanced studies in\nprofessional or vocational fields. While they may have strong theoretical\nunderpinnings, they must have as their primary purpose knowledge for\napplication in professional practice. Master's degree programs of this type are\nprimarily terminal in nature. They may serve as preparation for advanced\nstudies at the doctoral level, but they shall not be designed primarily for\nthis purpose. The doctorate in such studies is likewise practical, insofar as\nit prepares the student to train or supervise others in the field, to discover\nnew knowledge that has practical application in the field, or to prepare the\nstudent for a life of practice in the student's particular profession. Only the\nfollowing degrees may be conferred upon the completion of a professionally\noriented graduate program: Bachelor of Divinity (B.D.)\n\nBachelor of Laws (LL.B.)\n--------Engineer (---- E.)\n\nMaster of Architecture (M.Arch.)\n\nMaster of Arts in Teaching (M.A.T.)\n\nMaster of Business Administration (M.B.A.)\n\nMaster of Comparative Jurisprudence (M.C.J.)\n\nMaster of Comparative Law (M.C.L.)\n\nMaster of Divinity (M.Div.)\n\nMaster of Education (Ed.M. or M.Ed.)\n\nMaster of Engineering (M.E.)\n\nMaster of Fine Arts (M.F.A.)\n\nMaster of Food Science (M.F.S.)\n\nMaster of Forestry (M.F.)\n\nMaster of Health Administration (M.H.A.)\n\nMaster of Hebrew Literature (M.H.L.)\n\nMaster of Industrial and Labor Relations (M.I.L.R.)\n\nMaster of Industrial Design (M.I.D.)\n\nMaster of International Affairs (M.I.A.)\n\nMaster of Landscape Architecture (M.L.A.)\n\nMaster of Laws (LL.M.)\n\nMaster of Library Science (M.L.S.)\n\nMaster of Management in Hospitality (M.M.H.)\n\nMaster of Music (Mus.M.)\n\nMaster of Nutritional Science (M.N.S.)\n\nMaster of Physical Therapy (M.P.T.)\n\nMaster of Professional Studies (M.P.S.)\n\nMaster of Public Administration (M.P.A.)\n\nMaster of Public Health (M.P.H.)\n\nMaster of Regional Planning (M.R.P.)\n\nMaster of Religious Education (M.R.E.)\n\nMaster of Sacred Music (S.M.M.)\n\nMaster of Sacred Theology (S.T.M.)\n\nMaster of Science for Teachers (M.S.T.)\n\nMaster of Science in Education (M.S. in Ed.)\n\nMaster of Science in Pharmacy (M.S. in Pharm.)\n\nMaster of Social Science (M.S.Sc.)\n\nMaster of Social Work (M.S.W.)\n\nMaster of Studies in Law (M.S.L.)\n\nMaster of Theology (Th.M.)\n\nMaster of Urban Planning (M.U.P.)\n\nDoctor of Acupuncture (D.Ac.)\n\nDoctor of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine\n(D.A.O.M)\n\nDoctor of Arts (D.A.)\n\nDoctor of Audiology (Au.D.)\n\nDoctor of Chiropractic (D.C.)\n\nDoctor of Dental Surgery (D.D.S.)\n\nDoctor of Education (Ed.D.)\n\nDoctor of Engineering (D.Eng.)\n\nDoctor of Engineering Science (Eng.Sc.D.)\n\nDoctor of Hebrew Literature (D.H.L.)\n\nDoctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.)\n\nDoctor of Law (J.D.)\n\nDoctor of Library Science (L.S.D.)\n\nDoctor of Medical Science (Med.
