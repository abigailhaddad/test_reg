  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 230.3 - Gasoline dispensing sites - prohibitions and requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Submerged\nfilling. All gasoline storage tanks must be equipped with a metallic fill pipe\ndesigned and installed to minimize vapor emissions and the generation of static\nelectricity by terminating the pipe within 6 inches of the bottom of the\ntank. (b) Minimizing vapor releases. Owners and/or operators of any gasoline dispensing site must follow best\nmanagement practices to minimize vapor releases to the atmosphere. Measures to\nminimize vapor releases include, but are not limited to, the following: (1)\nminimizing gasoline spills; (2)\ncleaning up spills as expeditiously as\npracticable; (3)\ncovering all open\ngasoline containers and all gasoline storage tank fill-pipes with a gasketed\nseal when not in use; and\n(4)\nminimizing the amount of gasoline sent to open waste collection systems that\ncollect and transport gasoline to reclamation and recycling devices, such as\noil/water separators. (c) Stage I vapor recovery systems. The installation and operation of Stage I vapor\nrecovery systems are required for the transfer of gasoline into gasoline\nstorage tanks, based upon the site location and/or the annual gasoline\nthroughput of a gasoline dispensing site. Exempt sources are not required to\nmeet the provisions of paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of this\nsubdivision. (1)\n\nExempt sources. The\ninstallation and operation of Stage I vapor recovery systems is not required\nfor the transfer of gasoline into the following storage tanks: (i) gasoline storage tanks with a capacity\nless than 550 gallons and which are used exclusively for farm tractors engaging\nin agricultural or snowplowing activities and\n(ii)\ngasoline storage tanks used to store\ngasoline drained from vehicles at a vehicle dismantling facility. (2)\n\nMinimum requirements. Owners\nand/or operators of any Stage I vapor recovery system must replace, repair or\nmodify any worn or ineffective components or design elements to ensure the\nvapor-tight integrity and efficiency of the vapor collection and control\nsystem. (3)\n\nGasoline dispensing\nsites located in the New York City or Lower Orange County metropolitan areas\nwith an annual throughput less than 120,000 gallons. (i) No person may transfer or allow the\ntransfer of gasoline into any gasoline storage tank, installed or reconstructed\nafter January 1, 1979, located in the New York City metropolitan area without a\n\nStage I vapor recovery system that meets the requirements of paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision. (ii)\n\nNo person\nmay transfer or allow the transfer of gasoline into any gasoline storage tank, installed or reconstructed after October 15, 1994, located in the Lower Orange\n\nCounty metropolitan area without a Stage I vapor recovery system that meets the\nrequirements of paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nGasoline dispensing sites located in the\n\nNew York City metropolitan areas with an annual throughput of 120,000 gallons\nor more. (i) Gasoline dispensing sites with\nan annual throughput greater than or equal to 120,000 gallons but less than\n800,000 gallons. No person may transfer or allow the transfer of gasoline into\na gasoline storage tank without a Stage I vapor recovery system that meets the\nrequirements of paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nGasoline dispensing sites with an annual\nthroughput greater than or equal to 800,000 gallons. Six months after the\neffective date of this regulation, no person may transfer or allow the transfer\nof gasoline into a gasoline storage tank without a Stage I vapor recovery\nsystem that meets the requirements of paragraphs (6)(i), (6)(ii), 6(iii), and\n6(iv) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nGasoline dispensing sites located outside\nthe New York City metropolitan areas with an annual throughput greater than or\nequal to 120,000 gallons but less than 1,200,000 gallons. No person may\ntransfer or allow the transfer of gasoline into a gasoline storage tank without\na Stage I vapor recovery system that meets the requirements of paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision. (6)\n\nGasoline\ndispensing sites located outside the New York City metropolitan areas with an\nannual throughput of 1,200,000 gallons or more. (i) No person may transfer or allow the\ntransfer of gasoline into a gasoline storage tank without a Stage I vapor\nrecovery system that meets the following requirements: ('a')\nvapor connections and lines must be\nequipped with closures that seal upon disconnect; ('b')\nthe vapor line from the gasoline\nstorage tank to the gasoline cargo tank must be vapor-tight; ('c')\nthe pressure in the tank truck must not\nexceed 18 inches of water pressure or 5.9 inches of water vacuum during\ntransfer of gasoline from the truck into the gasoline storage tank; ('d')\nthe vapor recovery and product\nadapters, and the method of connection with the delivery elbow, must be\ndesigned to prevent the over-tightening or loosening of fittings during normal\ndelivery operations; ('e')\ngauge\nwells must have a submerged drop tube that extends the same distance from the\nbottom of the gasoline storage tank as required by subdivision\n230.3\n(a) of this\n\nPart; ('f')\nliquid fill connections\nfor all gasoline storage tanks must be equipped with vapor-tight\ncaps; ('g')\npressure/vacuum (P/V)\nvent valves must be installed and maintained on the gasoline storage tank vent\npipes in accordance with the following specifications: ('1')\na positive pressure setting of 2.5 to\n6.0 inches of water; ('2')\na\nnegative pressure setting of 6.0 to 10.0 inches of water; and\n('3')\nthe total leak rate of all P/V vent\nvalves at a gasoline dispensing site, including connections, may not exceed\n0.17 cubic foot per hour at a pressure of 2.0 inches of water and 0.63 cubic\nfoot per hour at a vacuum of 4.0 inches of water; and\n('h')\n\nStage I vapor recovery systems must be\ncapable of meeting the static pressure performance requirements of the\nfollowing equation: Pf = 2e\n-500.887/v\n\nWhere: Pf = minimum allowable final pressure, inches of\nwater\nv = total ullage affected by the test, gallons\ne = dimensionless constant equal to approximately\n2.718\n2 = the initial pressure, inches water\n(ii)\n\nAny gasoline storage tank\ninstalled or reconstructed after November 9, 2006 must be equipped with a\ndual-point vapor recovery system as defined in section\n230.2\n(b)(3)\nof\nthis Part.
