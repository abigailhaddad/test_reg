  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 431.19 - Conditional release of youth placed pursuant to a delinquency adjudication\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pursuant to section\n398\n(3-a)\nand\n404\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law, a youth placed pursuant to a delinquency adjudication\nunder article 3 of the Family Court Act with a local social services district\nmay be conditionally released from a facility or program to aftercare if: (1)\nit is consistent with the needs and best\ninterests of the youth; (2)\nsuitable care and supervision can be provided; and\n(3)\nthere is a reasonable probability the\nyouth can be conditionally released without endangering public\nsafety. (b) Limitation on granting conditional release. Any youth placed pursuant to a delinquency adjudication\nwho is absent from a facility or program without consent of the director of\nsuch facility or program shall not be granted conditional release while absent\nwithout consent solely by reason of such absence. For purposes of this section, absence without consent occurs when a youth disappears, runs away or is\notherwise absent without the consent of the person(s) or facility in whose care\nthe youth has been placed. (c) A youth placed pursuant to a delinquency\nadjudication shall be conditionally released to a parent(s), relative or\nguardian, unless in the opinion of the local social services district there is\nno suitable parent, relative or guardian to whom such youth can be released. In\nsuch cases, the local social services district may conditionally release the\nyouth to any other suitable person; provided that when such person has no legal\nrelationship with such youth, the district shall advise the person of the\nprocedures for obtaining custody or guardianship of the youth. (d) Where a youth placed pursuant to a\ndelinquency adjudication is over the age of 18 at the time of conditional\nrelease, and there is no suitable parent, relative or guardian to whom such\nyouth can be released, the local social services district may conditionally\nrelease the youth to either a suitable person or to his or her own\nrecognizance, provided there is at least one adult whom the local social\nservices district has identified as primary support for such youth, or a\nprogram, such as a transitional independent living support program, which will\nprovide additional supports and services for the youth. (e) A conditionally released youth placed\npursuant to a delinquency adjudication shall continue to be the responsibility\nof the local social services district for the period provided in the order of\nplacement, including under such circumstances for a youth whose release\nresource dies, is incarcerated or becomes otherwise incapacitated. Additionally, the local social services district may provide clothing, services\nand other necessities for any conditionally released juvenile delinquent, as\nmay be required including medical care and services not provided to such\njuvenile delinquent as medical assistance for needy persons pursuant to title\n11 of article 5 of the Social Services Law. (f) Conditions of release. (1)\n\nPrior to conditional release, such youth\nmust agree, in writing, to follow all conditions established for his or her\nrelease and acknowledge that a violation of the conditions can result in a\nmodification of the terms and conditions or a revocation of his or her\nrelease. (2)\n\nThe conditions for\nsuch youth's release shall be individualized and consistent with the youth's\nneeds and abilities and may include, but are not necessarily limited to: (i) keeping a daily schedule, which may\ninclude a reasonable curfew, set by the youth's aftercare worker or case\nmanager; (ii)\nparticipating in\nprograms and services as required; (iii)\nenrolling in or attending a school or\neducation program leading to a high school diploma if the youth is subject to\narticle 65 of the Education Law or elects to participate in an education\nprogram leading to a high school diploma.

(g) Prior to release, such youth and parent, relative, guardian or other suitable person shall be oriented to the conditions\nthe youth must follow, the structure of the conditional release program where\nrelevant, and the responsibilities of the staff working with the youth and\nfamily, as well as written documentation of the conditions of release and\nverbal notice that a violation of any condition may result in revocation of the\nrelease.

(j) Revocation of release, documentation. (1)\n\nThe youth's\naftercare worker shall prepare a written recommendation to revoke the youth's\nconditional release. The recommendation shall specify the factual circumstances\nrequiring revocation of the release, including: (i) the specific conditions violated and the\nfacts that demonstrate that the conditions were violated; and\n(ii)\nthe use of graduated response by the\ncase worker or aftercare staff to avoid revocation where appropriate; or\n(iii)\nfacts which demonstrate a\nchange of circumstances resulting in the determination that revocation is\nconsistent with promoting the welfare of the youth and the need to protect the\ncommunity. (2)\n\nThe\nwritten recommendation shall be reviewed by the youth's local social services\ndistrict case manager for final approval. (k) Revocation of release\nprocess. (1)\n\nThe local social services\ndistrict must provide the youth, and for youth less than 18 years of age the\nyouth's parents or guardians, with notice in a manner set forth by OCFS at\nleast 5 days prior to the hearing, of the reasons for revocation and an\nopportunity for the youth to be heard, including the rights set forth in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nThe youth may be permitted to remain in\nthe community until his or her opportunity to be heard occurs unless there are\nreasonable grounds to believe the youth will not appear for any mandatory\nappearances. (i) A social services official\nof a local social services district with an approved close to home plan may\nissue a warrant authorizing a peace officer acting pursuant to his or her\nspecial duties or a police officer to apprehend the youth placed pursuant to a\ndelinquency adjudication who has been determined to have violated the\nconditions of release and return such youth to an authorized agency, or for\nlimited secure juvenile delinquents to a detention facility. An employee of a\nlocal social services district with an approved close to home plan may be\ndesignated, without a warrant, to apprehend a youth who has violated his or her\nconditions of release. (ii)\n\nAll\nother local social services districts, the local social services commissioner\nor an authorized representative may petition the family court having\njurisdiction over the youth placed pursuant to a delinquency adjudication for a\nwarrant for the return of such youth to placement pending the outcome of the\nyouth's opportunity to be heard.

(ii)\n\nEach party has the right to be\nrepresented by counsel at the hearing; to examine and present documentary\nevidence; to testify; to produce, compel the attendance of, and examine\nwitnesses; and to cross-examine witnesses. (iii)\n\nThe official presiding over the hearing\nshall be an attorney who is not an employee of the local social services\ndistrict or the authorized agency responsible for such child and who shall be\nauthorized by the local social services district to make a determination\nregarding the child's release. The hearing officer shall have all the powers\nconferred by law to acquire attendance of witnesses and the production of books\nand records and to administer oaths and to take testimony. (iv)\nA verbatim record of the hearing shall\nbe made. (v) The record of the\nhearing shall be confidential, but it may be examined by either party, including the child, their parent, relative, guardian or other suitable person\nto whom they were released, or their designated legal representative. (vi)\n\nThe hearing officer shall issue a\nwritten decision, within four days following the hearing, determining whether\nsubstantial evidence supports a finding that the youth has violated one or more\nof the terms and conditions of the conditional release or there has been a\nchange of circumstances such that revocation of release is consistent with\npromoting the welfare of the youth and the need to protect the community. If\nthe hearing officer decides that substantial evidence supports such a finding, the hearing officer shall consider whether revocation of the youth's\nconditional release is in the youth's best interest and is necessary to protect\nthe community. If not, the hearing officer must order the youth's continuation\non aftercare, with or without modification of the conditions of release, as the\nhearing officer deems appropriate. If substantial evidence does not support\nsuch a finding, the hearing officer must order the youth be continued on\naftercare without modification of the conditions of release. (l) Voluntary\nreturn. A youth placed pursuant to a delinquency adjudication on\nconditional release status who has received a notice of a revocation may waive\nthe right to be heard and voluntarily return to the placement.

Any waiver of the right to be\nheard must be signed by the youth and the youth must fully understand the\nsignificance of the act. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
