  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 201-4.5 - Emission capping by rule\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Purpose'. The purpose of this section is to provide a method of establishing\nfederally enforceable emission caps known as capping by rule. A facility may\ncap by rule as follows: (1)\n'Major Facility\n\nThresholds'. To avoid the requirement for a Title V facility permit, the\nfacility owner or operator must maintain actual emissions of each regulated air\ncontaminant at less than 50 percent of the major facility thresholds, as\ndescribed in Paragraph 201-2.1(b)(21) of this Subpart, during each 12-month\nperiod; and/or\n(2)\n'Applicable\n\nState Thresholds'. To avoid the control requirements of a state regulation, the\nfacility owner or operator must maintain actual emissions of volatile organic\ncompounds at less than 50 percent of an applicability threshold based on\npotential to emit in that regulation during each 12-month period. (b) If the facility owner or\noperator determines that an emission limitation or requirement established by\nthis section is unacceptable, the owner or operator must apply for either a\n\nState facility permit pursuant to Subpart 201-5 of this Part or a title V\nfacility permit pursuant to Subpart 201-6 of this Part. (c) The owner or operator of any facility\nsubject to this section must maintain all required records on -site for a\nperiod of five years and make them available to representatives of the\ndepartment upon request. (d) The\nowner or operator of any facility that meets the criteria established pursuant\nto subdivisions (f), (g) and (h) of this section, and uses air pollution\ncontrol equipment to comply with an emissions cap established pursuant to this\nsection, shall operate and maintain such equipment in a manner consistent with\nmanufacturer's specifications. If such control equipment is required by any\nother Part of this Chapter and would limit emissions to a greater degree than\nthe thresholds established in this section then the more stringent emission\nlimitation applies. (e) The facility\nowner or operator must monitor and record process parameters to the extent\nnecessary to determine actual emissions, including but not limited to the\nfollowing: (1)\ninformation on emission\ncontrol equipment type and description, make a nd model, and emission sources\nserved by the emission control unit; (2)\ninformation on emission control equipment\ndesign, including where applicable: pollutant(s) controlled; control\neffectiveness; maximum design or rated capacity; inlet and outlet temperatures; concentrations of each pollutant controlled; catalyst data (type, material, life, volume, space velocity, ammonia injection rate and temperature); baghouse\ndata (design, cleaning method, fabric material, flow rate, air/cloth ratio); electrostatic precipitator data (number of fields, cleaning method, and power\noutput); scrubber data (type, design, sorbent type, pressure drop); other\ndesign data as appropriate; all emission source test information; and\n(3)\na monthly log of hours of operation\nincluding notation of any control equipment breakdowns, malfunctions, repairs, maintenance and any other deviations from design parameters. (f) The owner or operator of any\nstationary combustion installation subject to this section must keep and\nmaintain the following records: (1)\n\nRecords\nindicating the type and quantity of fuel combusted at the facility during every\n12-month period. Facilities capable of using more than one fuel must also\ndemonstrate that the actual emissions for every 12-month period do not exceed\nthe thresholds listed in subdivision (a) of this section, based on the type and\nquantity of fuel used. (2)\n\nInformation on equipment type, make and model, maximum design process rate or\nmaximum power input/output, all source test information, fuel heating value, percent sulfur for fuel oil, and a monthly log of hours of operation. (g) The owner or operator of any\nfacility that operates coating/solvent emission sources or uses a coating, solvent, ink, sealant or adhesive and is subject to this section must keep and\nmaintain the following records: (1)\na current\nlist of all coatings, solvents, inks, sealants and adhesives in use. This list\nmust include: information on the manufacturer, brand, product name or code, VOC\ncontent in pounds per gallon, hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) content in pounds\nper gallon, or other manufacturer's product specifications; (2)\na description of equipment used during\nand after coating, solvent, ink sealant or adhesive application, including\ntype, make and model; maximum design process rate or throughput; all emission\ncontrol unit information as described in subdivision (e) of this section, as\napplicable, and a description of the coating/solvent application/drying\nmethod(s) employed; (3)\na monthly\nlog of the consumption of each solvent (including solvents used in clean up and\nsurface preparation), coating, ink, sealant and adhesive used and calculations\nshowing compliance with the emission limits required by subdivision (a) of this\nsection, as applicable. For the purpose of complying with this Subpart, all\nVOCs and HAPs consumed during the application of coatings, solvents, inks, sealants and adhesives are to be considered as being emitted to the atmosphere; and\n(4)\nall purchase orders, invoices, and other documents to support the information in the monthly\nlog. (h) The owner or\noperator of a facility with general process, exhaust, or ventilation systems\nthat are subject to this Section, but do not f it the classifications described\nin subdivision (f) or (g) of this section, must keep an d maintain the\nfollowing records: (1)\ninformation on the\nprocess and equipment including the following: equipment type, description, make and model; maximum design process rate or throughput, all emission control\nunit information as described in subdivision (e) of this section, as\napplicable; (2)\na monthly log of\noperating hours, each raw material used and its amount, each product produced\nand its production rate; (3)\npurchase orders, invoices, and other documents to support information in the\nmonthly log; and\n(4)\nany additional\ninformation as requested by the department. (i) The owner or operator of any facility\nsubject to this section must apply for and obtain all necessary approvals prior\nto commencing any physical or operational change which will result in an\nincrease in actual emissions above the emission limitations in subdivision (a)\nof this section. The facility will remain subject to all applicable\nrequirements until a new emission cap is established in accordance with section\n201-7.1\nof this Part. (j) A responsible official must verify\nannually through a review of required records and totaling of emissions\ninformation that the facility is eligible for regulation by this section and\nhas operated in accordance with all requirements of this section. A record of\nthis verification must be kept on-site for inspection by the department for\nfive years, along with the emission estimates and their basis, showing\ncompliance with this section. In any situation where the provisions of this\nsection have not been or are not expected to be met, the facility owner or\noperator shall notify the department. (k) If the owner or operator of the facility\ncannot demonstrate, through the use of the limitations and requirements\ndescribed in this section, that the facility-wide emission totals for any\n12-month period are be low the emission limits as specified in subdivision (a)\nof this section, the facility must demonstrate compliance with all applicable\nrequirements the facility avoided pursuant to the provisions of this\nsection.
