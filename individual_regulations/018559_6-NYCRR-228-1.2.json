(ii)\n\nFor\nautomotive/transportation and business machine plastic parts surfaces stencil\ncoating, a coating that is applied over a stencil to a plastic part at a\nthickness of one millimeter or less of coating solids. (113)\n\nSubstrate. The surface onto which a\ncoating is applied, or into which a coating is impregnated. (114)\n\nTemporary total enclosure. An enclosure\nthat is not permanent; is constructed only to measure the capture efficiency of\npollutants emitted from a given source; and meets the requirements of\n40 CFR\n63.805(e)(1)(i)\nthrough (iv)\n(see table 1, section 200.9 of\nthis Title). (115)\n\nTexture coat. A\ncoating that is applied to a plastic part which, in its finished form, consists\nof discrete raised spots of the coating. (116)\n\nTile-board. A premium interior wall\nflat wood paneling product made of hardboard that is used in high moisture\nareas of the home such as kitchens and bathrooms. Specifically, tile-board\nmeets the specifications for Class I hardboard as approved by the American\n\nNational Standards Institute. (117)\n\nTopcoat. Is defined based on coating process as follows: (i) for automobile or light-duty truck\nassembly topcoat, the final coating system applied to provide the final color\nand/or a protective finish. The topcoat may be a monocoat color or\nbasecoat/clearcoat system. In-line repair and two-tone are parts of topcoat. Topcoat operations may include other coating(s) (e.g., blackout, interior\ncolor, etc.) that is (are) applied in the same spray booth(s); (ii)\nfor pleasure craft surface coating\ntopcoat, any final coating applied to the interior or exterior of a pleasure\ncraft; (iii)\nfor wood finishing\ntopcoat, any final coating applied to a wood or wood coated\nsubstrate. (118)\n\nTouch-up coating. A coating used to cover minor coating imperfections appearing\nafter the main coating operation. (119)\n\nTranslucent coating. A coating which\ncontains binders and pigment, and is formulated to form a colored, but not\nopaque, film. (120)\n\nTrunk interior\ncoating. Is defined based on specific coating processes as follows: (i) For automobile or light-duty truck\nassembly trunk interior coating, a coating, used at a coating facility outside\nof the primer-surfacer and topcoat operations, applied to the trunk interior to\nprovide chip protection. (ii)\n\nFor\nmotor vehicle truck interior coating, a coating, used at a facility that is not\nan automobile or light-duty truck assembly coating facility, applied to the\ntrunk interior to provide chip protection. (121)\n\nTwo-component coating. A coating\nrequiring the addition of a separate reactive resin, commonly known as a\ncatalyst, before application to form an acceptable dry film. (122)\n\nUnderbody coating. A coating, applied\nto the undercarriage or firewall to prevent corrosion and/or provide chip\nprotection. (123)\n\nVacuum-metalized\ncoating (miscellaneous metal and plastic parts). The undercoat applied to the\nsubstrate on which the metal is deposited or the overcoat applied directly to\nthe metal film. Vacuum metalizing/physical vapor deposition (PVD) is the\nprocess whereby metal is vaporized and deposited on a substrate in a vacuum\nchamber. (124)\n\nVacuum-metalized\ncoating. Topcoats and basecoats that are used in the vacuum-metalizing\nprocess. (125)\nVOC content limits. The permissible weight of VOC per volume of coating minus water and excluded\ncompounds at application as specified in the tables of section\n228-1.4\nof this Subpart. The actual\nVOC content of the as applied coating is calculated as follows: Equation 1\n\nImage\n1\nwhere: (VOC)\na\nis the VOC content of a\ncoating, as applied, expressed as weight of VOC per volume of coating minus\nwater and excluded compounds (keeping units consistent). (W\nv\n)\na\nis\nthe weight of total volatiles per volume of an as applied coating. (W\nw\n)\na\nis\nthe weight of water per volume of an as applied coating. (V\nw\n)\na\nis\nthe volumes of water per volume of an as applied coating. (W\ne\n)\na\nis\nthe weight of excluded VOC per volume of an as applied coating. (V\ne\n)\na\nis\nthe volumes of excluded VOC per volume of an as applied\ncoating. (126)\n\nWash coat. A\ncoating which contains binders that raise wood surfaces, prevent undesired\nstaining, and control penetration. (127)\n\nWeatherstrip adhesive. An adhesive, used at an automobile or light-duty truck assembly coating facility, applied to\nweatherstripping materials for the purpose of bonding it to the surface of a\nvehicle. (128)\n\nWood finishing. Consists of the application of one or more coatings, colored or clear\n(including but not limited to: stains, toners, wash-coats, sealers, and\ntopcoats), to wood products.
