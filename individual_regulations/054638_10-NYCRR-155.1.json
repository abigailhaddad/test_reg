(b) Definitions. (1)\n\nThe term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and include every spring, pond (other than the artificial reservoirs and filter basins), stream, ditch, gutter or other channel of any kind, the waters of which, when running whether continuously or occasionally, eventually flow or may flow into the public water supply of the City of Yonkers. (2)\n\nWherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a reservoir or from a watercourse is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (c) Privies adjacent to any reservoir or watercourse. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of any reservoir or within 50 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the City of Yonkers. (2)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 150 feet of any reservoir or within 75 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the City of Yonkers. (3)\n\nNo cesspool, pit or other receptacle of any kind used for the temporary storage of human excreta or sewage shall be constructed, located, maintained or allowed to remain between the limiting distances prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distances prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subdivision unless said cesspool, pit or other receptacle is made watertight and [continued] so arranged and equipped that the said excreta or sewage are at once removed by pump or other satisfactory means through watertight pipes or conduits to some proper place of ultimate disposal, as hereinafter provided, or unless suitable removable vessels or receptacles for the temporary storage of said human excreta or sewage are provided and at all times maintained in an absolutely watertight condition and in such manner as to permit of convenient removal of said excreta or sewage to some place of ultimate disposal as hereinafter set forth. (4)\n\nThe excreta collected in the aforesaid removable receptacles permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall be removed and the receptacles thoroughly cleaned and disinfected as often as may be found necessary to maintain the privy in proper sanitary condition and to effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents, while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal, shall be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises and the adjacent premises. (5)\n\nUnless otherwise specially ordered or permitted by the State Department of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid removable receptacles permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits at a depth of not less than 18 inches below the surface and at a distance not less than 300 feet from any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the City of Yonkers. (6)\n\nWhenever, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or owing to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local conditions, it is considered by the State Commissioner of Health that excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal or the garbage or wastes from any dump may be washed over the surface or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any reservoir or watercourse, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the trench or place of disposal or the said garbage or waste dump shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health.
