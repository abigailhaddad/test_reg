Agencies and schools which submit completed forms and reports to the\ndepartment shall be notified in writing by the department if such reports or\nforms need clarification or supplementation. An agency or school which is so\nnotified will be given an additional 30 days from the date of the notice to\nsubmit the corrected forms or reports. An authorized agency or approved school\nfor the handicapped which fails to submit the required forms and reports or\nsubmits part but not all of the required forms and reports to the department by\n\nNovember 1st will be deemed to have failed to meet the submittal\ndeadline. (2)\n\nIf for good cause\nshown, an agency or school is unable to meet the November 1st deadline, the\nagency or school may request an extension which must include an explanation of\nwhy the extension is needed. This request shall be submitted in writing to the\ndepartment prior to the November 1st due date. The department may grant an\nextension of up to 30 days. A further extension may be granted until December\n31st, if there are unusual circumstances which are beyond the control of the\nagency or school and which justify the extension. If the unusual circumstances\ncontinue to exist beyond December 31st, the department may grant one- month\nextensions until the agency or school is able to submit its mandated reports\nand forms. All extensions granted by the department pursuant to this paragraph\nshall be forwarded in writing to the appropriate authorized agency or\nschool. (3)\n\nThose authorized\nagencies and schools which are late in submitting the required forms or\nreports, or fail to respond within 30 days to a written request from the\ndepartment for additional or clarifying information on forms or reports already\nsubmitted, will be subject to a penalty. Such penalty shall result in a\nreduction in the allowable administrative cost component of the agency's or\nschool's maintenance rate for a specified period of time. The administrative\ncomponent for family boarding home programs is composed of the same\nadministrative cost accounts as are used in establishing the administrative\ncomponent for the group foster care programs and approved schools. The amount\nof the penalty will depend upon the number of days after November 1st which\nexpire prior to receipt of the required reports and forms by the department. The penalties will be determined in accordance with the following schedule: Days\nlate\n\nPercentage reduction of reimbursable\nadministrative cost component\n\nStarting date of full rate for authorized\nagencies\n\nStarting date of full rate for approved\nschools\n16 - 30 days\n10 percent\n\nJuly 15th\n\nSeptember 15th\n31 - 45 days\n20 percent\n\nAugust 1st\n\nOctober 1st\n46 - 60 days\n40 percent\n\nAugust 15th\n\nOctober 15th\n61 - 90 days\n50 percent\n\nSeptember 1st\n\nNovember 1st\n91 - 180 days\n60 percent\n\nSeptember 1st\n\nNovember 1st\n181 - 270 days\n75 percent\n\nSeptember 1st\n\nNovember 1st\n271 - 365 days\n90 percent\n\nSeptember 1st\n\nNovember 1st\n365+\n100 percent\n\nSeptember 1st\n\nNovember 1st\n\nFor those agencies or schools which have not submitted\ntheir mandated reports and forms by June 1st, the maintenance rate payable\nbeginning July 1st will be equal to the previous year's maintenance rate minus\n90 percent of such rate's administrative component. This reduced rate will\ncontinue in effect until a new maintenance rate can be calculated. Upon receipt\nof the required reports and forms, a new maintenance rate will be calculated\nand made effective retroactively. A percentage of the administrative cost\ncomponent of the new rate will be deducted from such rate in accordance with\nthe above-referenced penalty schedule. (4)\n\nThe department shall start counting the\nnumber of days late on November 2nd. For those agencies or schools which are\ngranted an extension by the department pursuant to paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, the count will start the day after the extension expires. For\nthose agencies or schools which receive a written request for additional or\nclarifying information pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the\npenalty count starts on the 31st day after the date of such written request if\nthe requested additional material is not submitted within the 30 days allowed. If the due date falls on a weekend or holiday, the count will begin on the next\nbusiness day. Every day which qualifies as a late day shall be counted when\ndetermining the total number of days that an agency or school is late in\nsubmitting the required documentation to the department. The total number of\ndays beyond the date authorized for submitting required reports or forms\npursuant to this Part or the date authorized for submitting supplemental\ninformation shall be considered in establishing the total number of late days\nand the amount of the penalty. (b) State reimbursement shall not be made to\na social services district on payments for foster care for children in an\ninstitution, group residence, group home program, agency boarding home program, foster family boarding home program or on payments for educationally\nhandicapped children in an approved school for the handicapped until the\ndepartment has promulgated a maximum State aid rate on which State\nreimbursement shall be made for providing care for a child in such\nfacilities. (c) Placements\noutside of New York State. State reimbursement for the cost of foster care for any\nchild provided in an institution, group residence, group home program, agency\nboarding home program or foster family boarding home program outside New York\n\nState shall not exceed the maximum reimbursement level established for the same\ntype of foster care purchased within New York State. (d) Community facilities\nprojects. Any special foster care project which is financed in\nwhole or in part pursuant to the provisions of title 5-A of article 6 of the\n\nSocial Services Law (Youth Facilities Improvement Act) and which has entered\ninto a regulatory agreement in the manner prescribed by the department, shall\nbe reimbursed and have its maximum reimbursement level set pursuant to the\nterms of said regulatory agreement and/or section\n410-i\nof\nthe Social Services Law, subject to the approval of the Director of the\n\nBudget.
