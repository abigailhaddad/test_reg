  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 642.4 - Imposition of the City of New York tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 253-a, Administrative Code of the City of New\n\nYork, §§ 11-2601(d), 11-2601(e)\n(a) (1)\n\nIn addition to the taxes imposed by\nsubdivisions 1, 1-a and 2 of section\n253\nof\nthe Tax Law, section\n253-a\nof the Tax Law authorizes the City\nof New York to impose the City of New York tax upon the recording of each\nmortgage on real property located in whole or in part within such city. Section\n11-2601 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York imposes such\ntax. (2)\n\nThe rate of tax for each\n$100 and each remaining fraction thereof of principal debt or obligation which\nis, or under any contingency may be secured at the date of execution thereof or\nat any time thereafter is as follows: (i) Where the amount of such principal debt or obligation is less than $500,000 the\nrate of tax is one dollar. (ii)\n\nWhere the amount of such principal debt or obligation is $500,000 or more and\nthe mortgage is of real property consisting only of a one-, two- or\nthree-family house or an individual residential condominium unit the rate of\ntax is one dollar and 12 1/2 cents. For purposes of determining whether the\nmortgage is of real property consisting only of a one-, two- or three-family\nhouse or an individual residential condominium unit, the nature of the property\nas of the date that the mortgage is executed must be used. (iii)\n\nWhere the amount of such principal debt\nor obligation is $500,000 or more and the mortgage is of real property which\nconsists of other than a one-, two- or three-family house or an individual\nresidential condominium unit the rate of tax is $1.75. (b) Proof required. (1)\n\nWhenever a mortgage of real property\nlocated in New York City is recorded and the amount secured by the mortgage is\n$500,000 or more, and is it is being claimed that the real property consists\nonly of a one-, two-, or three-family house or an individual residential\ncondominium unit, there shall be submitted, either in the mortgage instrument\nor by separate affidavit by the mortgagor, the mortgagee or by any person who\nhas knowledge of the facts, a statement that the real property consists of such\ntype of residential property. (2)\nA\nstatement in the mortgage that the real property is improved by a one-, or\ntwo-family residence or dwelling, sufficient to claim the $10,000 deduction\nfrom the additional tax, as provided in section\n642.2\n(b)(2)\nof this Part, is sufficient to satisfy the proof requirements of this\nsubdivision. (c) Determination of the applicable rate of the City of New York tax on\nrelated transactions. (1)\n\nThe\nprincipal debt or obligation which is, or under any contingency may be secured\nat the date of execution or at any time thereafter of a mortgage on real\nproperty located in such city, shall be aggregated with the principal debt or\nobligation which is, or under any contingency may be secured at the date of\nexecution or at any time thereafter of any other mortgage on real property\nlocated in such city, where such mortgages: (i) form part of the same or related\ntransactions; and\n(ii)\nhave the\nsame or related mortgagors. (2)\n\nIf the commissioner finds that a mortgage\ntransaction or mortgage transactions has or have been formulated for the\npurpose of avoiding or evading a rate of tax as provided under subdivision (a)\nof this section, in excess of the lowest such authorized rate, rather than\nsolely for an independent business or financial purpose, the commissioner shall\ntreat all of the mortgages forming part of such transaction or transactions as\na single mortgage for the purpose of determining the applicable rate of\ntax. (3)\n\nIt shall be presumed that\nall mortgages offered for recording within a period of 12 consecutive months\nhaving the same or related mortgagors are part of a related transaction, and\nshall be treated as a single mortgage for the purpose of determining the\napplicable rate of tax. Such presumption may be rebutted only with clear and\nconvincing evidence to the contrary. (4)\n\nThe term, when\nused in this subdivision with reference to mortgagors, shall include but not be\nlimited to: (i) members of a family, including\nspouses, ancestors, lineal descendants, and brothers and sisters (whether by\nwhole or half blood); (ii)\na\nshareholder and a corporation where more than 50 percent of the value of the\noutstanding stock of such corporation is owned or controlled directly or\nindirectly by such shareholder; (iii)\na partner and a partnership where more\nthan 50 percent of the capital or profits in such partnership is owned or\ncontrolled directly or indirectly by such partner; (iv)\na beneficiary and a trust where more\nthan 50 percent of the beneficial interest in such trust is owned or controlled\ndirectly or indirectly by such beneficiary; (v) two or more corporations, partnerships, associations, or trusts, or any combination thereof, which are owned or\ncontrolled, either directly or indirectly, by the same person, corporation or\nother entity, or interests; and\n(vi)\na grantor of a trust and the\ntrust. (d) Except as otherwise provided in these regulations, the City of New York tax is\nadministered and collected in the same manner as the basic tax described in\nsection\n642.1\nof this Part. (e) See section\n645.2\n(d) of this Title for information on the recording of a supplemental mortgage\ncreated for the purpose of providing additional or further security for the\npayment of the principal debt or obligation secured by a prior recorded primary\nmortgage by spreading the existing lien of the prior recorded mortgage or\nimposing a new lien on real property located in the City of New York. (f) Where real property covered by a mortgage\nsubject to the tax described in this section is situated in whole within New\n\nYork State but partly within and without the City of New York, the amount of\n\nCity of New York tax due and payable upon the recording of the mortgage shall\nbe determined in a manner similar to that described in section\n642.2\n(d) of this part. (g) Where real\nproperty covered by a mortgage subject to the tax described in this section is\nsituated both within New York City and without New York State, the amount of\n\nCity of New York tax due and payable shall be determined in a manner similar to\nthat described in Part 649 of this Title.
