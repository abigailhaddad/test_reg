Tit. 9 § 7.17 - Executive order no. 17: establishing measures to evaluate costs of mandates on local government to advance property tax relief\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the State of New York must be vigilant in its\nefforts to contain government spending and to stabilize property taxes; and\nWHEREAS, the citizens of New York bear an inordinately high\nproperty tax burden to fund counties, cities, towns, villages, school districts\nand special districts; and\nWHEREAS, such tax burdens are due in part to legislative\nand regulatory mandates that have been imposed on local governments by the\n\nState; and\nWHEREAS, it is critical that governments work together to\ncraft solutions to the high cost of government and cooperate in evaluating\noptions to restrain unnecessary spending at all levels of government in order\nto provide property tax relief to New York residents and businesses; and\nWHEREAS, the fiscal impact of any legislative or regulatory\nproposal that imposes a mandate should be evaluated to the fullest extent\npossible to consider the cost to local governments, in recognition of the goal\nof providing property tax relief; and\nWHEREAS, in order to limit property taxes, it is equally\nimportant periodically to examine existing agency regulations to ensure that\nthey do not impose unjustified costs and requirements on local\ngovernments; NOW, THEREFORE, I, DAVID A. PATERSON, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nlaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: 1. Definitions. For purposes of this order: a. \"Mandate\" shall mean: (i) any legal requirement that a local\ngovernment provide or undertake any program, project or activity, or increase\nspending for an existing program, project or activity; or\n(ii)\nany legal requirement that a local\ngovernment grant any new property tax exemption, or broaden the eligibility, or\nincrease the value of any existing property tax exemption; or\n(iii)\nany legal requirement that otherwise\nwould likely have the effect of raising property taxes. b. \"Local government\" shall mean a county, city, town, village, school district or special district. c. \"State agency\" shall mean: (i) any state agency, department, office, board, commission or other instrumentality of the state, including the\n\nExecutive Chamber; and\n(ii)\nany\npublic authority or public benefit corporation created by or existing under any\n\nState law, at least one of whose members is appointed by the Governor\n(including any subsidiaries of such public authority or public benefit\ncorporation), other than an interstate or international authority or public\nbenefit corporation. d. \"Cost-benefit analysis\" shall mean a specific delineation of the costs and\nbenefits to local governments including a quantification of the impact on local\ngovernment revenue and expenditures, where such impact is quantifiable based on\navailable information. 2. No state agency shall recommend, propose, publish or submit any legislation or regulation containing a mandate without an\naccounting of the impact of such mandate on local governments, which shall\ninclude the fiscal impacts of such mandate, a cost-benefit analysis, documentation of input sought and received by affected local governments, and\nproposed sources of revenue to fund such mandate. Prior to the formalization of\nany such proposal, such accounting shall be provided in writing to the\n\nSecretary to the Governor, the Counsel to the Governor, the Director of State\n\nOperations and the Director of the Division of Budget; provided, however, that\nif such proposal is necessary to protect against an urgent threat to public\nhealth or safety, such proposal may be formalized and advanced without such\naccounting only upon the approval of the Director of State Operations and the\n\nCounsel to the Governor, provided that such accounting shall be completed\npromptly thereafter. 3. Any\nproposed bill containing a mandate which is offered by a state agency to the\n\nLegislature shall be accompanied by a local fiscal impact statement which\nstates, so far as possible, such mandate's estimated cost to local governments. Such statement shall include but need not be limited to: a. an estimate of the present and future cost\nof compliance with such mandate from the Division of the Budget or from the\nstate agency having responsibility to administer the mandate proposed in such\nbill; b. a description of the\nmethodology used to estimate such present and future cost impacts; c. a summary of the input sought and obtained\nfrom the affected local governments or, where a mandate would be applicable\nstatewide, from organizations representative of local governments, including\nbut not limited to the New York State Association of Counties, the New York\n\nState Conference of Mayors and Municipal Officials, the Association of Towns of\nthe State of New York and the New York State School Boards\n\nAssociation; d. proposed revenue\nsources to fund such mandate; and e. a cost-benefit analysis of such\nmandate. 4. On or before\n\nDecember 1, 2009, each state agency shall review its regulations and report to\nthe Secretary to the Governor, the Counsel to the Governor, the Director of\n\nState Operations and the Director of the Division of the Budget on any proposed\nchanges to such regulations which could reduce the impact of existing mandates\non local governments and generate property tax relief for New York State\nproperty taxpayers.
