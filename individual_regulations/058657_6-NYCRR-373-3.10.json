  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.10 - Tank systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to owners or\noperators of facilities that use tank systems for storing or treating hazardous\nwaste, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this\nsubdivision or in section\n373-3.1\nof this Subpart. (1)\n\nTank systems that are used to store or\ntreat hazardous waste which contains no free liquids and that are situated\ninside a building with an impermeable floor are exempt from the requirements of\nsubdivision (d) of this section. To demonstrate the absence or presence of free\nliquids in the stored/treated waste, the following test must be used: method\n9095B (paint filter liquids test) as described in \"Test Methods for Evaluating\n\nSolid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" EPA Publication No. SW-846 as\nincorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nTank systems, including\nsumps, as defined in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle, that serve as part of a secondary containment system to collect or\ncontain releases of hazardous wastes are exempted from the requirements in\nparagraph (d)(1) of this section. (3)\n\nTanks, sumps, and other collection\ndevices used in conjunction with drip pads, as defined in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle and regulated under section\n373-3.23\nof this Subpart must meet\nthe requirements of this section. (b) Assessment of existing tank\nsystem's integrity. (1)\n\nFor each\nexisting tank system that does not have secondary containment meeting the\nrequirements of subdivision (d) of this section, the owner or operator must\ndetermine that the tank system is not leaking or is unfit for use. Except as\nprovided in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, the owner or operator must\nobtain and keep on file at the facility a written assessment reviewed and\ncertified by an independent, qualified, professional engineer registered in New\n\nYork that attests to the tank system's integrity by December 25, 1989. The\ncertification must be consistent with the applicable provisions of section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)(iv)\nof this Part. (2)\n\nThis assessment\nmust determine that the tank system is adequately designed and has sufficient\nstructural strength and compatibility with the wastes to be stored or treated\nto ensure that it will not collapse, rupture, or fail. At a minimum, this\nassessment must consider the following: (i) design standards, if available, according to which the tank and ancillary\nequipment were constructed; (ii)\nhazardous characteristics of the wastes that have been or will be\nhandled; (iii)\nexisting\ncorrosion-protection measures; (iv)\ndocumented age of the tank system, if available, (otherwise, an estimate of the\nage); and\n(v) results of a leak\ntest, internal inspection, or other tank integrity examination such that: (a) for nonenterable underground tanks, this\nassessment must consist of a leak test that is capable of taking into account\nthe effects of temperature variations, tank end deflection, vapor pockets, and\nhigh water table effect; and\n(b) for other than nonenterable underground tanks and for ancillary equipment, this\nassessment must be either a leak test, as described above, or an internal\ninspection and/or other tank integrity examination certified by an independent, qualified, professional engineer registered in New York that addresses cracks, leaks, corrosion and erosion. The certification must be consistent with the\napplicable provisions of section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)(iv)\nof this Part. Note: The practices described in the American Petroleum\n\nInstitute (API) publication, Guide for Inspection of Refinery\n\nEquipment, Chapter XIII, \"Atmosphere and Low-Pressure Storage Tanks,\"\n4th edition, 1981, may be used, where applicable, as guidelines in conducting\nan integrity examination of an other than nonenterable underground tank\nsystem. (3)\n\nTank systems that store or treat\nmaterials that become hazardous wastes after December 25, 1988, must conduct\nthis assessment within 12 months after the date that the waste becomes a\nhazardous waste. (4)\n\nIf, as a\nresult of the assessment conducted in accordance with paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, a tank system is found to be leaking or unfit for use, the owner\nor operator must comply with the requirements of subdivision (g) of this\nsection. (c) Design and installation of new tank systems or components. (1)\n\nOwners or operators of new tank systems\nor components must ensure that the foundation, structural support, seams, connections, and pressure controls (if applicable) are adequately designed and\nthat the tank system has sufficient structural strength, compatibility with the\nwastes to be stored or treated, and corrosion protection so that it will not\ncollapse, rupture or fail. The owner or operator must obtain a written\nassessment reviewed and certified by an independent, qualified, professional\nengineer registered in New York attesting that the system has sufficient\nstructural integrity and is acceptable for the storing and treating of\nhazardous waste. The certification must be consistent with the applicable\nprovisions of section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)(iv)\nof this Part. This assessment must include, at a minimum, the following\ninformation: (i) design standards according\nto which the tanks and ancillary equipment is or will be constructed; (ii)\nhazardous characteristics of the wastes\nto be handled; (iii)\nfor new tank\nsystems or components in which the external shell of a metal tank or any\nexternal metal component of the tank system is or will be in contact with the\nsoil or with water, a determination by a corrosion expert of: (a) factors affecting the potential for\ncorrosion, including but not limited to: (1)\nsoil moisture content; (2)\nsoil\npH; (3)\nsoil sulfides\nlevel; (4)\nsoil\nresistivity; (5)\nstructure to soil\npotential; (6)\ninfluence of nearby\nunderground metal structures (\ne.g., piping); (7)\nstray electric current; and\n(8)\nexisting corrosion-protection measures\n(\ne.g., coating, cathodic protection); and\n(b) the type and degree of external\ncorrosion-protection that are needed to ensure the integrity of the tank system\nduring the use of the tank system or component, consisting of one or more of\nthe following: (1)\ncorrosion-resistant\nmaterials of construction such as special alloys, fiberglass-reinforced\nplastic; (2)\ncorrosion-resistant\ncoating (such as epoxy or fiberglass) with cathodic protection\n(\ne.g., impressed current or sacrificial anodes); and\n(3)\nelectrical isolation devices such as\ninsulating joints and flanges; Note: The practices described in the National Association of\n\nCorrosion Engineers (NACE) standard, \"Recommended Practice (RP-02-85) Control\nof External Corrosion on Metallic Buried, Partially Buried, or Submerged Liquid\n\nStorage Systems,\" and the American Petroleum Institute (API) Publication 1632, \"Cathodic Protection of Underground Petroleum Storage Tanks and Piping\n\nSystems,\"\nmay be used, where applicable, as guidelines in providing\ncorrosion-protection for tank systems. (iv)\nfor underground tank system components\nthat are likely to be affected by vehicular traffic, a determination of design\nor operational measures that will protect the tank system against potential\ndamage; and\n(v) design\nconsiderations to ensure that: (a) tank\nfoundations will maintain the load of a full tank; (b) tank systems will be anchored to prevent\nflotation or dislodgement where the tank system is placed in a saturated zone, or is located within a seismic fault zone; and\n(c) tank systems will withstand the effects\nof frost heave. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator of a new tank\nsystem must ensure that proper handling procedures are followed to prevent\ndamage to the system during installation. Prior to covering, enclosing, or\nplacing a new tank system or component in use, an independent, qualified\ninstallation inspector or an independent, qualified, professional engineer\nregistered in New York, either of whom is trained and experienced in the proper\ninstallation of tank systems, must inspect the system or component for the\npresence of any of the following items: (i) weld breaks; (ii)\npunctures; (iii)\nscrapes of\nprotective coatings; (iv)\ncracks; (v) corrosion; and\n(vi)\nother structural damage or\ninadequate construction or installation. All discrepancies must be remedied before the tank system\nis covered, enclosed, or placed in use. (3)\n\nNew tank systems or components and piping\nthat are placed underground and that are backfilled must be provided with a\nbackfill material that is a noncorrosive, porous, homogeneous substance and\nthat is carefully installed so that the backfill is placed completely around\nthe tank and compacted to ensure that the tank and piping are fully and\nuniformly supported. (4)\n\nAll new\ntanks and ancillary equipment must be tested for tightness prior to being\ncovered, enclosed, or placed in use. If a tank system is found not to be tight, all repairs necessary to remedy the leaks in the system must be performed prior\nto the tank system being covered, enclosed, or placed in use. (5)\n\nAncillary equipment must be supported and\nprotected against physical damage and excessive stress due to settlement, vibration, expansion or contraction. Note: The piping system installation procedures described in\n\nAmerican Petroleum Institute (API) publication 1615 (November 1979), Installation of Underground Petroleum Storage Systems, or ANSI\nstandard B31.3, \"Petroleum Refinery System,\" may be used, where applicable, as\nguidelines for proper installation of piping systems. (6)\n\nThe owner or operator must provide the\ntype and degree of corrosion-protection necessary, based on the information\nprovided under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this subdivision, to ensure the\nintegrity of the tank system during use of the tank system. The installation of\na corrosion-protection system that is field-fabricated must be supervised by an\nindependent corrosion expert to ensure proper installation. (7)\n\nThe owner or operator must obtain and\nkeep on file at the facility written statements by those persons required to\ncertify the design of the tank system and supervise the installation of the\ntank system in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (2)-(6) of this\nsubdivision to attest that the tank system was properly designed and installed\nand that repairs, pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subdivision were\nperformed. These written statements must also include the certification\nstatement as required in section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)(iv)\nof this Part. (d) Containment and detection of releases. (1)\n\nIn order to prevent the release of\nhazardous waste or hazardous constituents to the environment, secondary\ncontainment that meets the requirements of this section must be provided\n(except as provided in paragraphs [6] and [7] of this subdivision): (i) for all new tank systems or components, prior to their being put into service and for existing tank systems or\ncomponents; and\n(ii)\nfor tank\nsystems that store or treat materials that become hazardous wastes, within two\nyears of the hazardous waste listing. (2)\n\nSecondary containment systems must be: (i) designed, installed, and operated to\nprevent any migration of wastes or accumulated liquid out of the system to the\nsoil, ground water, or surface water at any time during the use of the tank\nsystem; and\n(ii)\ncapable of\ndetecting and collecting releases and accumulated liquids until the collected\nmaterial is removed. (3)\n\nTo meet the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, secondary\ncontainment systems must be at a minimum: (i) constructed of or lined with materials that are compatible with the wastes to\nbe placed in the tank system and must have sufficient strength and thickness to\nprevent failure due to pressure gradients (including static head and external\nhydrological forces), physical contact with the waste to which they are\nexposed, climatic conditions, the stress of installation, and the stress of\ndaily operation (including stresses from nearby vehicular traffic); (ii)\nplaced on a foundation or base capable\nof providing support to the secondary containment system, providing resistance\nto pressure gradients above and below the system, and preventing failure due to\nsettlement, compression, or uplift; (iii)\nprovided with a leak detection system\nthat is designed and operated so that it will detect the failure of either the\nprimary and secondary containment structure or any release of hazardous waste\nor accumulated liquid in the secondary containment system within 24 hours, or\nat the earliest practicable time if the existing detection technology or site\nconditions will not allow detection of a release within 24 hours; and\n(iv)\nsloped or otherwise designed or operated\nto drain and remove liquids resulting from leaks, spills, or precipitation. Spilled or leaked waste and accumulated precipitation must be removed from the\nsecondary containment system within 24 hours, or in as timely a manner as is\npossible to prevent harm to human health or the environment, if removal of the\nreleased waste or accumulated precipitation cannot be accomplished within 24\nhours. Note: If the collected material is a hazardous waste under Part\n371 of this Title, it is subject to management as a hazardous waste in\naccordance with all applicable requirements of Parts 372 through 374 and 376 of\nthis Title. If the collected material is discharged through a point source to\nwaters of the United States, it is subject to the requirements of Parts 700, 701 and 750 of this Title. If discharged to publicly owned treatment works\n(POTWs), it is subject to the requirements of section 307 of the Clean Water\n\nAct, as amended. If the collected material is released to the environment, it\nmay be subject to the reporting requirements of 40 CFR part\n302. (4)\n\nSecondary containment for tanks must include one or more of the following\ndevices: (i) a liner (external to the\ntank); (ii)\na vault; (iii)\na double-walled tank; or\n(iv)\nan equivalent device as approved by the\ndepartment. (5)\n\nIn\naddition to the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of this\nsubdivision, secondary containment systems must satisfy the following\nrequirements: (i) external liner systems must\nbe: (a) designed or operated to contain 100\npercent of the capacity of the largest tank or the volume of all interconnected\ntanks, whichever is greater, within its boundary; (b) designed or operated to prevent run-on or\ninfiltration of precipitation into the secondary containment system unless the\ncollection system has sufficient excess capacity to contain run-on or\ninfiltration. Such additional capacity must be sufficient to contain\nprecipitation from a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event; (c) free of cracks or gaps; (d) designed and installed to completely\nsurround the tank and to cover all surrounding earth likely to come into\ncontact with the waste if released from the tanks (\ni.e., capable of preventing lateral as well as vertical migration of the waste. For\nonground tanks, the external liner system must also encompass the bottom of the\ntank); (e) external concrete liners\nmust be constructed with chemical-resistant water stops in place at all joints\n(if any); and\n(f) external concrete\nliners must be provided with an impermeable interior coating that is compatible\nwith the stored waste and that will prevent migration of waste into the\nconcrete. (ii)\nvault\nsystems must be: (a) designed or operated to\ncontain 100 percent of the capacity of the largest tank or the volume of all\ninterconnected tanks, whichever is greater, within its boundary; (b) designed or operated to prevent run-on or\ninfiltration of precipitation into the secondary containment system unless the\ncollection system has sufficient excess capacity to contain run-on or\ninfiltration. Such additional capacity must be sufficient to contain\nprecipitation from a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event; (c) constructed with chemical-resistant water\nstops in place at all joints (if any); (d) provided with an impermeable interior\ncoating or lining that is compatible with the stored waste and that will\nprevent migration of waste into the concrete; (e) provided with a means to protect against\nthe formation of and ignition of vapors within the vault, if the waste being\nstored or treated: (1)\nmeets the definition\nof ignitable waste under section\n371.3\n(b) of this\n\nTitle; or\n(2)\nmeets the definition\nof reactive waste under section\n371.3\n(d) of this\n\nTitle and may form an ignitable or explosive vapor; and\n(f) provided with an exterior moisture\nbarrier or be otherwise designed or operated to prevent migration of moisture\ninto the vault if the vault is subject to hydraulic pressure. (iii)\ndouble-walled tanks must be: (a) designed as an integral structure\n(\ni.e., an inner tank within an outer shell) so that any\nrelease from the inner tank is contained by the outer shell; (b) protected, if constructed of metal, from\nboth corrosion of the primary tank interior and the external surface of the\nouter shell; and\n(c) provided with\na built-in, continuous leak detection system capable of detecting a release\nwithin 24 hours or at the earliest practicable time, if the owner or operator\ncan demonstrate to the commissioner, and the commissioner concurs, that the\nexisting leak detection technology or site conditions will not allow detection\nof a release within 24 hours. Note: The provisions outlined in the Steel Tank Institute's\n(STI)\n\nStandard for Dual Wall Underground Steel Storage Tank\nmay be used as guidelines for aspects of the design of underground steel\ndouble-walled tanks. (6)\n\nAncillary equipment must be provided with\nfull secondary containment (\ne.g., trench, jacketing, double-walled piping) that meets the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of\nthis subdivision except for: (i) aboveground\npiping (exclusive of flanges, joints, valves and connections) that are visually\ninspected for leaks on a daily basis; (ii)\nwelded flanges, welded joints, and\nwelded connections that are visually inspected for leaks on a daily\nbasis; (iii)\nsealless or magnetic\ncoupling pumps and sealless valves that are visually inspected for leaks on a\ndaily basis; and\n(iv)\npressurized\naboveground piping systems with automatic shutoff devices\n(\ne.g., excess flow check valves, flow metering shutdown\ndevices, loss of pressure actuated shutoff devices) that are visually inspected\nfor leaks on a daily basis. (7)\n\nThe owner or operator may obtain a\nvariance from the requirements of this subdivision if the commissioner finds, as a result of a demonstration by the owner or operator, either: that\nalternative design and operating practices together with location\ncharacteristics will prevent the migration of hazardous waste or hazardous\nconstituents into the ground water or surface water at least as effectively as\nsecondary containment during the active life of the tank system; or that in the\nevent of a release that does migrate to ground water or surface water, no\nsubstantial present or potential hazard will be posed to human health or the\nenvironment. New underground tank systems may not, per a demonstration in\naccordance with subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, be exempted from the\nsecondary containment requirements of this subdivision. Application for a\nvariance as allowed in this paragraph does not waive compliance with the\nrequirements of this section for new tank systems. (i) In deciding whether to grant a variance\nbased on a demonstration of equivalent protection of ground water and surface\nwater, the commissioner will consider: (a) the nature and quantity of the waste; (b) the proposed alternate design and\noperation; (c) the hydrogeologic\nsetting of the facility, including the thickness of soils between the tank\nsystem and ground water; and\n(d) all other factors that would influence the quality and mobility of the\nhazardous constituents and the potential for them to migrate to ground water or\nsurface water. (ii)\n\nIn\ndeciding whether to grant a variance, based on a demonstration of no\nsubstantial present or potential hazard, the commissioner will consider: (a) the potential adverse effects on ground\nwater, surface water, and land quality taking into account: (1)\nthe physical and chemical characteristics\nof the waste in the tank system, including its potential for\nmigration; (2)\nthe hydrogeological\ncharacteristics of the facility and surrounding land; (3)\nthe potential for health risks caused by\nhuman exposure to waste constituents; (4)\nthe potential for damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste\nconstituents; and\n(5)\nthe\npersistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects; (b) the potential adverse effects\nof a release on ground water quality, taking into account: (1)\nthe quantity and quality of ground water\nand the direction of ground water flow; (2)\nthe proximity and withdrawal rates of\nwater in the area; (3)\nthe current\nand future uses of ground water in the area; and\n(4)\nthe existing quality of ground water, including other sources of contamination and their cumulative impact on the\nground water quality; (c) the potential adverse effects of a\nrelease on surface water quality, taking into account: (1)\nthe quantity and quality of ground water\nand the direction of ground water flow; (2)\nthe patterns of rainfall in the\nregion; (3)\nthe proximity of the\ntank system to surface waters; (4)\nthe current and future uses of surface waters in the area and any water quality\nstandards established for those surface waters; and\n(5)\nthe existing quality of surface water, including other sources of contamination and the cumulative impact on surface\nwater quality; and\n(d) the potential adverse effects of a release on the land surrounding the tank\nsystem, taking into account: (1)\nthe patterns\nof rainfall in the region; and\n(2)\nthe current and future uses of the surrounding land. (iii)\n\nThe owner or operator of a\ntank system, for which a variance from secondary containment had been granted\nin accordance with the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, at\nwhich a release of hazardous waste has occurred from the primary tank system\nbut has not migrated beyond the zone of engineering control (as established in\nthe variance), must: (a) comply with the\nrequirements of subdivision (g) of this section, except paragraph (4); and\n(b) decontaminate or remove\ncontaminated soil to the extent necessary to: (1)\nenable the tank system, for which the\nvariance was granted, to resume operation with the capability for the detection\nof and response to releases at least equivalent to the capability it had prior\nto the release; and\n(2)\nprevent the\nmigration of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents to ground water or\nsurface water; and\n(c) if contaminated soil cannot be removed or decontaminated in accordance with\nclause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph, comply with the requirements\nof paragraph (h)(2) of this section. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator of a tank system, for which a variance from secondary containment had been granted in accordance\nwith the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, at which a release\nof hazardous waste has occurred from the primary tank system and has migrated\nbeyond the zone of engineering control (as established in the variance), must: (a) comply with the requirements of\nparagraphs (g)(1)-(4) of this section; (b) prevent the migration of hazardous waste\nor hazardous constituents to ground water or surface water, if possible, and\ndecontaminate or remove contaminated soil. If contaminated soil cannot be\ndecontaminated or removed, or if ground water has been contaminated, the owner\nor operator must comply with the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of this\nsection; and\n(c) provide secondary\ncontainment in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1)-(6) of this\nsubdivision if repairing, replacing, or reinstalling the tank system, or\nreapply for a variance from secondary containment and meet the requirements for\nnew tank systems in subdivision (c) of this section if the tank system is\nreplaced. The owner or operator must comply with these requirements even if\ncontaminated soil can be decontaminated or removed, and ground water or surface\nwater has not been contaminated. (8)\n\nThe following procedures must be followed\nin order to request a variance from secondary containment. (i) The commissioner must be notified in\nwriting by the owner or operator that the owner or operator intends to conduct\nand submit a demonstration for a variance from secondary containment as allowed\nin paragraph (7) of this subdivision according to the following schedule: (a) for existing tank systems, at least 24\nmonths prior to the date that secondary containment must be provided in\naccordance with paragraph (1) of this subdivision; and\n(b) for new tank systems, at least 30 days\nprior to entering into a contract for installation of the tank\nsystem. (ii)\n\nAs part of\nthe notification, the owner or operator must also submit to the commissioner a\ndescription of the steps necessary to conduct the demonstration and a timetable\nfor completing each of the steps. The demonstration must address each of the\nfactors listed in subparagraph (7)(i) or (ii) of this subdivision. (iii)\n\nThe demonstration for a variance must\nbe completed and submitted to the commissioner within 180 days after notifying\nthe commissioner of intent to conduct the demonstration. (iv)\n\nThe commissioner will inform the public, through a newspaper notice, of the availability of the demonstration for a\nvariance. The notice shall be placed in a daily or weekly major local newspaper\nof general circulation and shall provide at least 30 days from the date of the\nnotice for the public to review and comment on the demonstration for a\nvariance. The commissioner also will hold a public hearing, in response to a\nrequest or at his or her own discretion, whenever such a hearing might clarify\none or more issues concerning the demonstration for a variance. Public notice\nof the hearing will be given at least 30 days prior to the date of the hearing\nand may be given at the same time as notice of the opportunity for the public\nto review and comment on the demonstration. These two notices may be\ncombined. (v) The commissioner will\napprove or disapprove the request for a variance within 90 days of receipt of\nthe demonstration from the owner or operator and will notify in writing the\nowner or operator and each person who submitted written comments or requested\nnotice of the variance decision. If the demonstration for variance is\nincomplete or does not include sufficient information, the 90-day time period\nwill begin when the commissioner receives a complete demonstration, including\nall information necessary to make a final determination. If the public comment\nperiod in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph is extended, the 90-day time\nperiod will be similarly extended. (9)\n\nAll tank systems, until such time as\nsecondary containment meeting the requirements of this subdivision is provided, must comply with the following: (i) for\nnonenterable underground tanks, a leak test that meets the requirements of\nsubparagraph (b)(2)(v) of this section must be conducted at least\nannually; (ii)\nfor other than\nnonenterable underground tanks and for all ancillary equipment, an annual leak\ntest, as described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, or an internal\ninspection or other tank integrity examination by an independent, qualified, professional engineer registered in New York that addresses cracks, leaks, corrosion, and erosion must be conducted at least annually. The owner or\noperator must remove the stored waste from the tank, if necessary, to allow the\ncondition of all internal tank surfaces to be assessed; Note: The practices described in the American Petroletm\n\nInstitute (API) publication\n\nGuide for Inspection of Refining\n\nEquipment, Chapter XIII, \"Atmospheric and Low Pressure Storage Tanks\", 4th edition, 1981, may be used, when applicable, as guidelines for assessing\nthe overall condition of the tank system. (iii)\nthe owner or operator must maintain on\nfile at the facility a record of the results of the assessments conducted in\naccordance with subparagraphs (i)-(iii) of this paragraph; and\n(iv)\nif a tank system or component is found\nto be leaking or unfit-for-use as a result of the leak test or assessment in\nsubparagraphs (i)-(iii) of this paragraph, the owner or operator must comply\nwith the requirements of subdivision (g) of this section. (e) General operating requirements. (1)\n\nHazardous wastes or treatment reagents\nmust not be placed in a tank system if they could cause the tank, its ancillary\nequipment, or the secondary containment system to rupture, leak, corrode, or\notherwise fail. (2)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must use appropriate controls and practices to prevent spills and\noverflows from tank or secondary containment systems. These include at a\nminimum: (i) spill prevention controls\n(\ne.g., check valves, dry disconnect couplings); (ii)\noverfill prevention controls\n(\ne.g., level sensing devices, high level alarms, automatic\nfeed cutoff, or bypass to a standby tank); and\n(iii)\nmaintenance of sufficient freeboard in\nuncovered tanks to prevent overtopping by wave or wind action or by\nprecipitation. (3)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must comply with the requirements of subdivision (g) of this\nsection if a leak or spill occurs in the tank system. (4)\n\nThe owner or operator must mark all tanks\nwith the words \"hazardous waste\" and with other words that identify the\ncontents of the tanks. For underground tanks, the markings must be placed on a\nsign in the area above the tank. (f) Inspections. For the purposes of this subdivision, the term 'operating\nday' means any calendar day when manufacturing (or the functional equivalent\nfor non-manufacturing operations) is taking place. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator must inspect, where\npresent, at least once each operating day, data gathered from monitoring and\nleak detection equipment (\ne.g., pressure or temperature\ngauges, monitoring wells) to ensure that the tank system is being operated\naccording to its design. Note: Section\n373-3.2\n(f)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart requires the owner or operator to remedy any deterioration or\nmalfunction the owner or operator finds. Subdivision (g) of this section\nrequires the owner or operator to notify the department within 24 hours of\nconfirming a release. Also, 40 CFR part\n302\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) may require the owner or operator to notify the National Response Center\nof a release. (2)\n\nExcept as\nnoted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision, the owner or operator must\ninspect at least once each operating day: (i) overfill/spill control equipment (\ne.g., waste-feed cutoff\nsystems, bypass systems, and drainage systems) to ensure that it is in good\nworking order; (ii)\nabove ground\nportions of the tank system, if any, to detect corrosion or releases of waste; and\n(iii)\nthe construction\nmaterials and the area immediately surrounding the externally accessible\nportion of the tank system, including the secondary containment system (e.g., dikes) to detect erosion or signs of releases of hazardous waste\n(\ne.g., wet spots, dead vegetation). (3)\n\nOwners or operators of tank systems that\neither use leak detection equipment to alert facility personnel to leaks, or\nimplement other established workplace practices to ensure leaks are promptly\nidentified within 24 hours, must inspect at least weekly those areas described\nin subparagraphs (2)(i) through (iii) of this subdivision. Use of the alternate\ninspection schedule must be documented in the facility's operating record. This\ndocumentation must include a description of the established workplace practices\nat the facility. (4)\n\nAncillary\nequipment that is not otherwise secondarily contained, as described in\nsubparagraph (d)(6)(i) through (iv) of this section, must be inspected at least\nonce each operating day. (5)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must inspect cathodic protection systems, if present, according to, at a minimum, the following schedule to ensure that they are\nfunctioning properly: (i) the proper\noperation of the cathodic protection system must be confirmed within six months\nafter initial installation, and annually thereafter; and\n(ii)\nall sources of impressed current must be\ninspected and/or tested, as appropriate, at least bimonthly\n(\ni.e., every other month). Note: The practices described in the National Association of\n\nCorrosion Engineers (NACE) standard, \"Recommended Practice (RP-02-85) Control\nof External Corrosion on Metallic Buried, Partially Buried, or Submerged Liquid\n\nStorage Systems\", (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) and the American Petroleum Institute (API) publication, 1632, Cathodic Protection of Underground Petroleum Storage Tanks and Piping\n\nSystems, (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) may be used, where applicable, as guidelines in maintaining and\ninspecting cathodic protection systems. (6)\n\nThe owner or operator must document in\nthe operating record of the facility an inspection of those items in paragraphs\n(1) through (5) of this subdivision. (g) Response to leaks or spills and\ndisposition of leaking or unfit-for-use tank systems. A tank system or secondary containment system from which\nthere has been a leak or spill, or which is unfit-for-use, must be removed from\nservice immediately, and the owner or operator must satisfy the following\nrequirements: (1)\n\nCessation of use; prevent flow or addition of wastes. The owner or operator must immediately stop the flow of\nhazardous waste into the tank system or secondary containment system and\ninspect the system to determine the cause of the release. (2)\n\nRemoval of waste from tank system or\nsecondary containment system. (i) If the\nrelease was from the tank system, the owner or operator must, within 24 hours\nafter detection of the leak or, if the owner or operator demonstrates that that\nis not possible, at the earliest practicable time remove as much of the waste\nas is necessary to prevent further release of hazardous waste to the\nenvironment and to allow inspection and repair of the tank system to be\nperformed. (ii)\n\nIf the release was\nto a secondary containment system, all released materials must be removed\nwithin 24 hours or in as timely a manner as is possible to prevent harm to\nhuman health and the environment. (3)\n\nContainment of visible releases to the\nenvironment. The owner or operator must immediately conduct a visual\ninspection of the release and, based upon that inspection: (i) prevent further migration of the leak or\nspill to soils or surface water; and\n(ii)\nremove, and properly dispose of, any\nvisible contamination of the soil or surface water. (4)\n\nNotifications, reports. (i) Any release to the environment, except as\nprovided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, must be reported to the\ncommissioner within 24 hours of detection. If the release has been reported\npursuant to Part 595 of this Title, that report will satisfy this requirement. Note: The DEC spill hotline is (800) 457-7362; outside of New\n\nYork State (518) 457-7362. (ii)\nA leak or spill of hazardous waste that\nis: (a) less than or equal to a quantity of\none pound; and\n(b) immediately\ncontained and cleaned-up is exempted from the requirements of this\nparagraph. (iii)\n\nWithin\n30 days of detection of a release to the environment, a report containing the\nfollowing information must be submitted to the commissioner: (a) likely route of migration of the\nrelease; (b) characteristics of the\nsurrounding soil (soil composition, geology, hydrogeology, climate); (c) results of any monitoring or sampling\nconducted in connection with the release, (if available). If sampling or\nmonitoring data relating to the release are not available within 30 days, these\ndata must be submitted to the commissioner as soon as they become\navailable; (d) proximity to\ndowngradient drinking water, surface water, and population areas; and\n(e) description of response actions taken or\nplanned. (5)\n\nProvision of secondary containment repair, or closure. (i) Unless the owner or operator satisfies\nthe requirements of subparagraphs (ii)-(iv) of this paragraph, the tank system\nmust be closed in accordance with subdivision (h) of this section. (ii)\n\nIf the cause of the release was a spill\nthat has not damaged the integrity of the system, the owner/operator may return\nthe system to service as soon as the released waste is removed and repairs, if\nnecessary, are made. (iii)\n\nIf the\ncause of the release was a leak from the primary tank system into the secondary\ncontainment system, the system must be repaired prior to returning the tank\nsystem to service. (iv)\n\nIf the\nsource of the release was a leak to the environment from a component of a tank\nsystem without secondary containment, the owner/operator must provide the\ncomponent of the system from which the leak occurred with secondary containment\nthat satisfies the requirements of subdivision (d) of this section before it\ncan be returned to service, unless the source of the leak is an aboveground\nportion of a tank system. If the source is an aboveground component that can be\ninspected visually, the component must be repaired and may be returned to\nservice without secondary containment as long as the requirements of paragraph\n(6) of this subdivision are satisfied. If a component is replaced to comply\nwith the requirements of this subparagraph, that component must satisfy the\nrequirements for new tank systems or components in subdivisions (c) and (d) of\nthis section. Additionally, if a leak has occurred in any portion of a tank\nsystem component that is not readily accessible for visual inspection\n(\ne.g., the bottom of an inground or onground tank), the entire\ncomponent must be provided with secondary containment in accordance with\nsubdivision (d) of this section prior to being returned to use. (6)\n\nCertification of major\nrepairs. If the owner or operator has repaired a tank system in\naccordance with paragraph (5) of this subdivision, and the repair has been\nextensive (\ne.g., installation of an internal liner; repair of\na ruptured primary containment or secondary containment vessel), the tank\nsystem must not be returned to service unless the owner/operator has obtained a\ncertification in accordance with section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)(iv)\nof this Part by an independent, qualified, professional engineer registered in\n\nNew York that the repaired system is capable of handling hazardous wastes\nwithout release for the expected life of the system. This certification must be\nsubmitted to the commissioner within seven days after returning the tank system\nto use. Note: The commissioner may, on the basis of any information\nreceived that there is or has been a release of hazardous waste or hazardous\nconstituents into the environment, issue an order under ECL article 71\nrequiring corrective action or such other response as deemed necessary to\nprotect human health or the environment. Note: See section\n373-3.2\n(f)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart for the requirements necessary to remedy a failure. Also, 40 CFR\npart\n302\nrequires the owner or operator to notify the National Response Center\nof a release of any \"reportable quantity\". (h) Closure and post-closure\ncare. (1)\n\nAt closure of a tank system\nthe owner or operator must remove or decontaminate all waste residues, contaminated containment system components (liners, etc.), contaminated soils, and structures and equipment contaminated with waste, and manage them as\nhazardous waste, unless section\n371.1\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Title applies. The closure plan, closure activities, cost estimates for\nclosure, and financial responsibility for tank systems must meet all of the\nrequirements specified in sections 373-3.7 and\n373-3.8\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nIf the owner or operator demonstrates\nthat not all contaminated soils can be practicably removed or decontaminated as\nrequired in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, then the owner or operator must\nclose the tank system and perform post-closure care in accordance with the\nclosure and post-closure care requirements that apply to landfills (section\n373-3.14\n[d]\nof\nthis Subpart). In addition, for the purposes of closure, post-closure, and\nfinancial responsibility, such a tank system is then considered to be a\nlandfill, and the owner or operator must meet all of the requirements for\nlandfills specified in sections 373-3.7 and\n373-3.8\nof this Subpart. (3)\n\nIf an owner or operator has a tank system\nwhich does not have secondary containment that meets the requirements of\nparagraphs (d)(2)-(6) of this section and which is not exempt from the\nsecondary containment requirements in accordance with paragraph (d)(7) of this\nsection, then: (i) The closure plan for the\ntank system must include both a plan for complying with paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision and a contingency plan for complying with paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (ii)\nA contingent\npost-closure plan for complying with paragraph (2) of this subdivision must be\nprepared and submitted as part of the permit application. (iii)\n\nThe cost estimates calculated for\nclosure and post-closure care must reflect the costs of complying with the\ncontingent closure plan and the contingent post-closure plan, if these costs\nare greater than the costs of complying with the closure plan prepared for the\nexpected closure under paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (iv)\n\nFinancial assurance must be based on the\ncost estimates in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. (v) For the purposes of the contingent\nclosure and post-closure plans, such a tank system is considered to be a\nlandfill, and the contingent plans must meet all of the closure, post- closure, and financial responsibility requirements for landfills under sections 373-3.7\nand\n373-3.8\nof this Subpart. (i) Special\nrequirements for ignitable or reactive wastes. (1)\n\nIgnitable or reactive waste must not be\nplaced in a tank system, unless: (i) the\nwaste is treated, rendered, or mixed before or immediately after placement in\nthe tank system so that: (a) the resulting\nwaste, mixture, or dissolved material no longer meets the definition of\nignitable or reactive waste under section\n371.3\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(b) section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with; or\n(ii)\nthe waste is stored or treated in such a\nway that it is protected from any material or conditions that may cause the\nwaste to ignite or react; or\n(iii)\nthe tank system is used solely for emergencies. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator of a facility where\nignitable or reactive waste is stored or treated in tanks must comply with the\nrequirements for the maintenance of protective distances between the waste\nmanagement area and any public ways, streets, alleys, or an adjoining property\nline that can be built upon as required in Tables 2-1 through 2-6 of the\n\nNational Fire Protection Association's \"Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code\"\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). (j) Special requirements for incompatible wastes. (1)\n\nIncompatible wastes, or incompatible\nwaste and materials, must not be placed in the same tank system, unless section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (2)\n\nHazardous waste must not be placed in a tank system that has not been\ndecontaminated and that previously held an incompatible waste or material, unless section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (k) Waste analysis and trial\ntests. In addition to performing the waste analysis required by\nsection\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart, the owner or operator must, whenever a tank system is to be used to\ntreat chemically or to store a hazardous waste that is substantially different\nfrom waste previously treated or stored in that tank system; or treat\nchemically a hazardous waste with a substantially different process than any\npreviously used in that tank system: (1)\nconduct waste analyses and trial\ntreatment or storage tests (\ne.g., bench-scale or pilot-plant\nscale tests); or\n(2)\nobtain\nwritten, documented information on similar waste under similar operating\nconditions to show that the proposed treatment or storage will meet the\nrequirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Note: Section\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart requires the waste analysis plan to include analyses needed to comply\nwith subdivisions (i) and (j) of this section. Section\n373-3.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart requires the owner or operator to place the results from each waste\nanalysis and trial test, or the documented information, in the operating record\nof the facility. (l) Special requirements for generators\nof between 100 and 1,000 kg/mo that accumulate hazardous waste in tanks. (1)\n\nThe requirements of this subdivision\napply to small quantity generators of more than 100 kg but less than 1,000 kg\nof hazardous waste in a calendar month, that accumulate hazardous waste in\ntanks for less than 180 days (or 270 days if the generator must ship the waste\ngreater than 200 miles), and do not accumulate over 6,000 kg onsite at any\ntime. (2)\n\nGenerators of between 100\nand 1,000 kg/mo hazardous waste must comply with the following general\noperating requirements: (i) Treatment or\nstorage of hazardous waste in tanks must comply with section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. (ii)\n\nHazardous wastes\nor treatment reagents must not be placed in a tank if they could cause the tank\nor its inner liner to rupture, leak, corrode, or otherwise fail before the end\nof its intended life. (iii)\n\nUncovered tanks must be operated to ensure at least 60 centimeters (two feet)\nof freeboard, unless the tank is equipped with a containment structure\n(\ne.g., dike or trench), a drainage control system, or a\ndiversion structure (\ne.g., standby tank) with a capacity that\nequals or exceeds the volume of the top 60 centimeters (two feet) of the\ntank. (iv)\n\nWhere hazardous waste is\ncontinuously fed into a tank, the tank must be equipped with a means to stop\nthis inflow (\ne.g., waste feed cutoff system or bypass system\nto a standby tank). Note: These systems are intended to be used in the event of a\nleak or overflow from the tank due to a system failure (\ne.g., a malfunction in the treatment process, a crack in the tank, etc). (3)\n\nExcept\nas noted in paragraph (4) of this subdivision, generators between 100 and 1,000\nkg/mo accumulating hazardous waste in tanks must inspect, where present: (i) discharge control equipment\n(\ne.g., waste feed cutoff systems, bypass systems, and drainage\nsystems) at least once each operating day, to ensure that it is in good working\norder; (ii)\ndata gathered from\nmonitoring equipment (\ne.g., pressure and temperature gauges)\nat least once each operating day to ensure that the tank is being operated\naccording to its design; (iii)\nthe\nlevel of waste in the tank at least once each operating day to ensure\ncompliance with subparagraph (2)(iii) of this subdivision; (iv)\nthe construction materials of the tank\nat least weekly to detect corrosion or leaking of fixtures or seams; and; (v) the construction materials\nof, and the area immediately surrounding, discharge confinement structures\n(\ne.g., dikes) at least weekly to detect erosion or obvious\nsigns of leakage (\ne.g., wet spots or dead vegetation). Note: As required by section\n373-3.2\n(f)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart, the owner or operator must remedy any deterioration or\nmalfunction the owner or operator finds. (4)\n\nGenerators who accumulate between 100 and\n1,000 kg/mo of hazardous waste in tanks or tank systems that have full\nsecondary containment and that either use leak detection equipment to alert\nfacility personnel to leaks, or implement other established workplace practices\nto ensure leaks are promptly identified and must inspect at least weekly, where\napplicable, the areas identified in subparagraphs (3)(i) and (v) of this\nsubdivision. Use of the alternate inspection schedule must be documented in the\nfacility's operating record. This documentation must include a description of\nthe established workplace practices at the facility. (5)\n\nGenerators of between 100 and 1,000 kg/mo\naccumulating hazardous waste in tanks must, upon closure of the facility, remove all hazardous waste from tanks, discharge control equipment and\ndischarge confinement structures. Note: At closure, as throughout the operating periods, unless\nthe owner or operator can demonstrate, in accordance with section\n371.1\n(d)(3) or (4)\nof this Title, that any solid waste removed from the tank is not a hazardous\nwaste, the owner or operator becomes a generator of hazardous waste and must\nmanage it in accordance with all applicable requirements of Parts 370 through\n374 and 376 of this Title. (6)\n\nGenerators of between 100 and 1,000 kg/mo\nmust comply with the following special requirements for ignitable or reactive\nwaste: (i) Ignitable or reactive waste must\nnot be placed in a tank, unless: (a) the\nwaste is treated, rendered, or mixed before or immediately after placement in a\ntank so that: (1)\nthe resulting waste, mixture, or dissolution of material no longer meets the definition of ignitable\nor reactive waste under section\n371.3\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(2)\nsection\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with; or\n(b) the waste is stored or treated in such a\nway that it is protected from any material or conditions that may cause the\nwaste to ignite or react; or\n(c) the tank is used solely for emergencies. (ii)\n\nThe owner or operator of a facility\nwhich treats or stores ignitable or reactive waste in covered tanks must comply\nwith the buffer zone requirements for tanks contained in Tables 2-1 through 2-6\nof the National Fire Protection Association's \"Flammable and Combustible\n\nLiquids Code\" (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). (7)\n\nGenerators\nof between 100 and 1,000 kg/mo must comply with the following special\nrequirements for incompatible wastes. (i) Incompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and materials, (see Appendix 29 of\nthis Title for examples) must not be placed in the same tank, unless section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (ii)\n\nHazardous waste must not be placed in an unwashed tank which previously held an\nincompatible waste or material, unless section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (m) Air emissions standards. The owner or operator shall manage all hazardous waste\nplaced in a tank in accordance with the applicable requirements of sections\n373-3.27, 373-3.28 and\n373-3.29\nof this\n\nSubpart. Notes\nN.Y.
