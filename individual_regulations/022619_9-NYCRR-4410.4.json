Tit. 9 § 4410.4 - Off-track pick three pool conducted solely off-track\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When approved by the commission after\nfiling of the required written consent of the track affected, an off-track\nbetting pool designated a pick three pool may be conducted by one or a\ncombination of off-track betting corporations in a single off-track pool, which\npool is not combined with any pool at a track. (b) The pick three (or other approved name)\nis a form of pari-mutuel wagering conducted by an off-track betting corporation\non three consecutive races run at any track, specifically designated as the\npick three races by the commission. Each bettor selects, in order, the first\nplaced horse in each of the three races designated and advertised by the\ncorporation as the pick three races, in the order so designated by the\ncommission. (c) The pick three is\nnot a parlay and has no connection with nor relation to the other betting pools\nfor the respective races. The pick three pool shall be held entirely separate\nfrom all other pools and is no part of a daily double, exacta, triple or other\nwagering pool. (d) Resale of pick\nthree tickets from one individual to another is prohibited, shall be grounds\nfor ejection, and may be deemed illegal gambling. (e) Races in which pick three pools shall be\nconducted shall be approved by the commission and shall be clearly designated\nin the program and racing cards issued by the corporation. (f) The design of the pick three tickets\nshall be clearly and immediately distinguishable from other pari-mutuel\ntickets. (g) Scratch. (1)\n\nIf a horse is scratched or declared a\nnonstarter in any of the three races designated as the pick three races before\nthe running of the first of those races, no further pick three tickets may be\nissued designating such horse and all pick three tickets previously issued\ndesignating such horse shall be refunded and the money deducted from the gross\npool. (2)\n\nShould any horse be\nscratched or declared a nonstarter in any race of the designated pick three\nraces, the race in which the late scratch has occurred will be declared \"no\nrace\" for purposes of the pick three pool only, and the net pools shall be\ndistributed equally to the holders of tickets who have designated the winners\nof the remaining pick three races. (h) Failure to select winning combination. (1)\n\nIf no pick three ticket is sold combining\nthe winners of the three races, all pick three tickets designating two winners\nshall be considered winning tickets and the net pool distributed equally to\nholders of said tickets. (2)\n\nIf no\npick three ticket is sold combining the winners of either three or two races of\nthe pick three races, all pick three tickets designating one winner shall be\nconsidered winning tickets and the net pool distributed equally to holders of\nsaid tickets. (3)\n\nIf no pick three\nticket is sold designating any winner to win in the designated pick three\nraces, the pick three shall be declared off and the gross pool\nrefunded. (4)\n\nIf any of the\ndesignated races are cancelled or declared \"no race,\" the pick three will be\ndetermined by the winners of the remaining race or races. (i) Dead heats. In the event of a dead heat\nfor win in any or all pick three races, all pick three tickets designating\neither horse to win in said race or races shall be eligible for participation\nin the remaining pick three races, and the net pool shall be equally\ndistributed to the winners, that is, the net pool will be divided by the total\namount represented by all winning tickets and the resulting price, per dollar, and after breakage, shall be the payoff price, which shall be uniform for any\nwinning combination. (j) In the\nevent of occurrences not encompassed with the explicit provisions of this Part, distribution shall be formulated on the basis of established pari-mutuel\npractice and in accordance with the distribution philosophy set forth in this\nsection; provided, nevertheless, that if full distribution of the pool is made\non the basis of outstanding tickets, the method of formulation announced by the\ncorporation and upon which basis payments have been made shall be deemed\nconclusively correct and not subject to review. (k) Copies of this section shall be made\navailable free of charge to the public in each betting facility of the\ncorporation. (l) Placing of horses\nshall follow the official placing for betting purposes at the track and such\nplacing shall be conclusive for distribution purposes herein. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
