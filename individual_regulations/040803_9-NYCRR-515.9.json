  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 515.9 - Absent without leave (awol) and unauthorized absence (ua)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Introduction. (1)\n\nThis section and section\n515.10\nof\nthis Part have been developed to assist New York Army National Guard commanders\ndeal with AWOL problems. In order to effectively accomplish his mission, a\ncommander should maximize the use of his personnel assets (service members). If\na commander's unit is understaffed due to an excessive number of members being\nabsent without leave (AWOL), the commander will be hard-pressed to accomplish\nhis or her mission and have his or her unit be an effective force. (2)\n\nAccordingly, commanders should take such\nmeasures to ensure that members are present for duty when prescribed and\ncorrect situations which produce excessive AWOL's. (b) Objective. The purpose of this Chapter is\nto provide commanders with guidance and the measures that can be taken from a\nmilitary justice perspective to ensure attendance for duty of his or her\nmembers. (c) Definitions. In order\nto deal with the issues of attendance of members for duty some definitions\nshould be reviewed. (1)\n\nAbsent without leave\n(AWOL) is defined in the New York State Military Law 130.82 as: (i) any person subject to this code who\nwithout proper authority: (a) fails to go to\nhis appointed place of duty at the time prescribed; or\n(b) goes from that place; or\n(c) absent himself or remains absent from his\nunit, organization or other place of duty at which he is required to be at the\ntime prescribed; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct. The terms\nabsent without leave (AWOL) and unauthorized absence (UA) for purposes of this\n\nChapter are identical. The New York State Military Law, like the Federal Uniform\n\nCode of Military Justice, 1983 (UCMJ-1983) enumerates related offenses to AWOL\nsuch as missing movement, New York State Military Law, section 130.83 and\ndesertion, New York State Military Law, section 130.81. (2)\n\nMissing movement is\ndefined as any person subject to this code who through neglect or design misses\nthe movement of a ship, aircraft or unit with which he is required in the\ncourse of duty to move shall be punished as a court-martial may\ndirect. (3)\n\nDesertion is defined\nas: (i) Any member of the organized militia\nwho: (a) without proper authority goes or\nremains absent from his place of service, organization, or place of duty with\nintent to remain away therefrom permanently; or\n(b) quits his unit or organization or place\nof duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service; or\n(c) without being regularly\nseparated from one of the forces of the organized militia enlists or accepts an\nappointment in the same or another one of the forces of the organized militia\nwithout fully disclosing the fact that he has not been so regularly separated\nis guilty of desertion. (ii)\n\nAny officer of the organized militia\nwho, having tendered his resignation and prior to due notice of the acceptance\nof the same, quits his post or proper duties without leave and with intent to\nremain away therefrom permanently is guilty of desertion. (iii)\n\nAny person found guilty of desertion or\nattempted desertion shall be punished as a court-martial may direct. (d) Measures to prevent\nAWOL. (1)\n\nOrientation of unit members. Unit\ncommanders, unit personnel officers, or personnel noncommissioned officers\n(NCO's) must ensure that members are fully aware of and understand their\nobligations. The members must further be made aware of the prerequisites for\nparticipation and the actions that will result from unsatisfactory\nparticipation. This information is furnished members by: (i) Advising each newly assigned enlisted\nmember of the principal provisions of clauses (a)-(h) of this subparagraph as\nthey relate to enlistment or assignment. Emphasis will be placed on the\nmember's responsibility to keep his or her commander informed current mailing\naddress as required by AR 135-133, chapter 3. Enlisted members will also be\nrequired to furnish the name and address of a person who will always know their\naddress. (a) service obligations; (b) participation requirements; (c) excused absences from training; (d) unexcused absences from\ntraining; (e) relocation of\nresidence (transfer to new unit); (f) unit training schedule. Inform each newly\nassigned member where it is posted and that it is his or her responsibility to\nkeep informed of the training schedule; (g) reassignment and removal from\nassignment; (h) consequences of\nfailure to participate satisfactorily (non-judicial punishment and\ncourts-martial). (ii)\n\nObtaining from each member with statutory or contractual obligation, a\nstatement acknowledging attendance at an orientation. The statement will show\nthat the member understands his or her service obligations and the\nparticipation requirements. The ARNG will sign a Statement of Understanding of\n\nReserve Obligation and Responsibilities (NGR 600-200, NGB form 590). These\nstatements will be signed in the presence of and countersigned by the unit\ncommander, unit personnel officer, or personnel noncommissioned officer. A new\nstatement will be obtained from each member whenever changes are made in the\ngoverning regulations which affect service obligations. This also includes\nparticipation requirements and/or the consequences of failure to participate\nsatisfactorily. At least once annually, each member will review, initial and\ndate his or her signed orientation statement. (iii)\n\nScreening the military personnel\nrecords jacket, U.S. Army (MPRJ) of each newly assigned enlisted member to\nensure that the proper statement clause (1)(i)(b) of this subdivision has been\nprepared. If this document is missing, the member must acknowledge an\nunderstanding of the service requirements by signing and dating the proper\ndocument. (iv)\n\nFiling the statement\nin the member's MPRJ as a permanent document. (e) Factors to consider. (1)\n\nThe reasons for the failure of members to\nreport for duty at the prescribed time and place may have several sources. It\nis the responsibility of commanders, as managers, to investigate these reasons\nand take corrective action. (2)\n\nThe\nfollowing factors should be considered in selecting an appropriate course of\naction. They include, but are not limited to, the following: (i) The nature of the failure to report for\nduty. (a) Was it intentional, or was it\ninadvertent? (i.e., a breakdown in communication or transportation. Did the\nmember know where and when he was to report, or was there a breakdown in a mode\nof transportation to the place of duty?)\n(b) If the failure to report for duty was\nintentional; (1)\n\nDid the individual fail to\nreport for duty for reasons of personal necessity? (i.e., conflicting civilian\nemployment schedule, or illness of individual or close family member, or\nunalterable civilian vacation schedules). (2)\n\nDid the member fail to report for duty\nfor selfish reasons? (i.e., going to a social or athletic event). (3)\n\nDid the member fail to report for duty\ndue to fear of discrimination or harassment from members of the unit? (i.e., a\npersonality conflict between a commissioned officer and the member). (f) Other factors to consider. (1)\n\nThe age and maturity of the\nindividual. (2)\n\nThe length of\nservice of the individual. (3)\n\nThe\nrank of the individual. (4)\n\nThe\nfrequency of the unauthorized absences. (5)\n\nPrior counseling, reprimands or\ndisciplinary actions. (g) Commanders' options. In order to reduce\nunauthorized absences, the commander shall employ the following measures: (1)\ntelephone inquiry to\nindividual; (2)\ncounseling\n(oral); (3)\nadmonition (oral or\nwritten); (4)\nreprimand; (5)\nwithholding of privileges; (6)\nrestriction; (7)\nextra duties; (8)\nforfeiture of pay; (9)\nreduction in grade; (10)\nadministrative separation; and\n(11)\ncourts-martial; Note: Procedures in paragraphs (5)-(11) of this subdivision\ncan only be accomplished through non-judicial punishment or courts-martial. Nonjudicial punishment is administered in accordance with Part 519 of this\n\nTitle. Measures such as restriction, withholding of privileges and extra duties\nshould not be imposed when the member is in IDT status\n(h) Telephone inquiry of\nindividual\n(1)\n\nUpon the discovery of a member\nwho has not reported for duty, the commander or his or her designee shall\ntelephone the absent member's home to ascertain his or her whereabouts and the\nreason for the member's failure to report for duty\n(2)\n\nThe caller shall impress upon the member\nor other person who answers the telephone that such unauthorized absence will\nnot be tolerated and that if there is a problem with him or her reporting for\nduty that he or she should explain such reasons\n(3)\n\nThe caller shall maintain a log of the\ncalls indicating the date and time called, the individual and telephone number\ncalled, the name of the caller and any remarks made by the individual called or\nother person with whom the caller spoke. A sample log is in Appendix L-2\n(A21)\n(4)\n\nIf the individual does\nnot have a legitimate reason for his or her failure to report for duty he or\nshe should be advised to report for AWOL counseling by the commander or his or\nher designee on or prior to the next scheduled duty day. (See Appendix L-2\n[A23] for appropriate action on absences)\n(i) Notification by mail. In addition to the\ntelephone call, the absent individual should be forwarded two copies of a\nletter, one by regular mail and the other by certified mail, return receipt\nrequested advising him or her that he or she was absent without leave on a\nparticular duty day for a particular period of time and that he or she had an\nobligation to report for duty as prescribed and that he or she should advise\nthe commander if there exists any legitimate reason for his or her failure to\nreport for duty. The letter should also advise the member that he or she may be\nsubject to non-judicial punishment or courts-martial for his or her\nunauthorized absence. A copy of such letter is in Appendix L-2 (A22)\n(j) Counseling. Counseling is the least\nsevere procedure in the management of improper conduct. Counseling should be\ninformal and private. It is used to correct behavior which will require\ndisciplinary measures, if continued. Counseling is a positive nondisciplinary\nmanagement tool used primarily to correct or improve future behavior or\nconduct\n(k) Admonition. The\nadmonition, either oral or written, is suitable for first time AWOL's. This is\nthe lowest level of a disciplinary action and, in effect, serves as a first\ntime warning that, if the AWOL is repeated, more severe discipline may be\nimposed. When imposing this form of discipline, the member should be allowed to\nexplain his or her actions and offer facts in mitigation or justification. The\nmember should also be specifically advised that, if the misconduct is repeated\nmore severe discipline will be imposed. An admonition may be included in a\nreprimand\n(l) Reprimand\n(1)\n\nThe reprimand is an act of formal censure\nby a commander which reproves or rebukes the individual for his or her\nAWOL\n(2)\n\nBoth the written\nadministrative admonition or reprimand will contain a statement that it has\nbeen imposed as an administrative measure and not a punishment under Military\n\nLaw, section\n130.15. Admonitions and reprimands imposed as punishment under\nsection\n130.15, whether administered orally or in writing, should state clearly\nthat they were imposed as punishment under that section. The written statement\nshould contain, as a minimum, the following: (i) An enumeration of the date, time and\nplace from which the member was absent without leave\n(ii)\n\nThe statement that the\nadmonition/reprimand is imposed as punishment under section\n130.15\nor as\nadministrative action\n(iii)\n\nThe\nstatement that the letter of admonition or reprimand will remain on file as a\ntemporary document not less than one year, or to the next reenlistment, whichever is greater\n(m) Other remedies\n(1)\n\nIf, after investigating the facts\nsurrounding the individual's reasons for not reporting for duty as prescribed, the commander concludes that the individual is sincere and desires to\nparticipate in the unit and is an asset to the unit, but has a problem with a\nsenior noncommissioned officer or commissioned officer, the commander may\nconsider: (i) reassignment of the individual\nwithin the unit; (ii)\ntransfer of\nthe individual to another unit; or\n(iii)\nequivalent training or substituted unit\ntraining assemblies (SUTA's) pursuant to NGR 350-1, para 2-7, 4-5 and\n4-10\n(n) Further measures. If the foregoing measures prove fruitless to deter future\nAWOL's, the commander should consider disciplinary measures such as\nnon-judicial punishment pursuant to New York Military Law, section\n130.15\n(see\n\nPart 519 of this Title) or courts-martial pursuant to article 7 of the New York\n\nState Military Law (see Parts 515 and 516 of this Title) and New York State\n\nManual for Courts-Martial\n(o) Separation. If the individual continues to accrue unauthorized absences after\nthe foregoing measures have been utilized, the commander should seriously\nconsider separation from the military pursuant to chapter 7, NGR 600-200 or\nappropriate Air Force regulations.
