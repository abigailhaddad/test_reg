  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1960.9 - Administrative\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Powers of the\ndirector. (1)\n\nThe director shall be empowered\nto issue permits in accordance with this Part allowing discharge of wastes to\nthe water board POTW or MS4, to validate connection permits, and to prevent\nillicit connections, activities, and discharges to the MS4. (2)\n\nThe director or his authorized\nrepresentative is empowered by this Part to initiate any of the following\ncourses of action, through a notice of violation or otherwise, with respect to\nusers whenever, in his sole discretion, any section of this Part is violated: (i) reject the waste; (ii)\nrequire pretreatment; (iii)\nrequire a control over quantities and\nrate of discharge; (iv)\nrequire a\npayment of a surcharge to be determined by the director based on reasonable\nassessment of the degree of violation and/or additional costs of treatment\nresulting from the violation; (v) require surveillance and/or monitoring of discharges and attendant\nreporting; (vi)\nrequire the\ndevelopment of compliance schedules and submission of attendant reports\nnecessary to assure compliance; (vii)\nmodify or revoke the wastewater\ndischarge permit; (viii)\nterminate\nsewer service; (ix)\nrequire\nimplementation of best management practices to control illicit discharges and\nactivities; (x) require the\nelimination of illicit connections or illicit discharges; (xi)\nrequire cessation of violating\ndischarges, practices or operations; (xii)\nrequire abatement or remediation of\nstormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any\naffected property; (xiii)\nrequire\nthe performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting; (xiv)\nrequire payment of a fine; and\n(xv)\nseek injunctive relief. (a) The owner or operator of a commercial or\nindustrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable\nprotection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes\ninto the MS4 through the use of structural and non-structural BMPs. (b) Any person responsible for a property or\npremise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge or an activity\ncontaminating stormwater, may be required to implement, at said person's\nexpense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to reduce or eliminate\nthe source of pollutant(s) to the MS4. (c) Compliance with all terms and conditions\nof a valid SPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with\nindustrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with\nthe provisions of this section. (3)\n\nIf refused access to the subject private\nproperty, the director, or his or her authorized representative, may seek a\nwarrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter upon the\nproperty to determine whether a violation of water board regulations has\noccurred. Upon determination that a violation has occurred, the director or\nauthorized representative may seek a court order to take any and all measures\nreasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. The\ncost of implementing and maintaining such measures shall be the sole\nresponsibility of the discharger. (4)\n\nExcept in the event of an emergency, reasonable advance notice of the action to be taken shall be given by the\ndirector but, unless negotiated upon initiation by the user, shall in no case\nexceed 60 calendar days. Once notice of action is given, the user shall have 10\nbusiness days to respond to the charges contained therein or submit a response\ncontesting the action. (5)\n\nIf a\nresponse contesting the action is entered, prior to scheduling a formal\nhearing, the user may at the discretion of the director be afforded the\nopportunity to meet with the director to resolve the matter by mutual consent. If settlement cannot be reached, then, upon request of the user, the director\nshall refer the matter to the water board for a formal hearing. The water board\nmay appoint and refer the dispute or enforcement proceeding to a hearing\nofficer who shall conduct the hearing of the alleged violation and contest\nthereof. The hearing officer shall promptly conduct the hearing and provide a\nwritten report to the water board with a recommendation, based on the evidence\npresented, for a final determination by the water board. Reasonable notice\nshall be given to the user who shall be allowed to present relevant evidence\nand argument at the hearing. A written decision by the water board based upon\nevidence and argument presented shall be made within 30 days following the\nconclusion of the hearing or receipt of the hearing officer's report. The\ndecision of the water board shall be only subject to review pursuant to article\n78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State. Following such hearing, the water board may commence an action, in any court having jurisdiction, seeking appropriate legal and/or equitable relief, including injunctions\nagainst the violative activity, from users not in compliance with any of the\nprovisions of this Part, or any pretreatment standards and\nrequirements. (6)\n\nThe director\nreserves the right to terminate or prevent a discharge after informal notice to\nthe discharger to immediately halt a discharge which reasonably appears to\npresent imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, property of\nthe water board POTW, MS4 or to the environment. Informal notice shall be\nfollowed as soon as practicable by action as provided by this\nsection. (7)\n\nActions to be taken by\nthe director shall be documented in the form of a letter, an administrative\norder, or other document as the director may reasonably determine. (8)\n\nThe director may promulgate\nadministrative procedures, technical specifications or guidances to implement\nany and all sections of this Part. These procedures, specifications and\nguidances shall have the same force and effect as if they were fully set forth\nin this Part. (9)\n\nAccess and\nmonitoring of discharges to the MS4. (i) The\ndirector shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to\nregulation under this law as often as may be necessary to determine compliance\nwith the water board regulations. If a discharger has security measures that\nrequire proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the\ndischarger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to the\ndirector. (ii)\n\nFacility operators\nshall allow the director ready access to all parts of the premises for the\npurposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records as may be\nrequired by these regulations. (iii)\n\nThe water board shall have the right to\nset up on any facility subject to this law such devices as are necessary in the\nopinion of the director to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's\nstormwater discharge. (iv)\n\nThe\nwater board has the right to require the facilities subject to these\nregulations to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably necessary to\ndetermine compliance with these regulations. The facility's sampling and\nmonitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper\noperating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to\nmeasure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their\naccuracy. (v) Unreasonable delays\nin allowing the water board access to a facility shall be a violation. A person\nwho is the operator of a facility subject to this law commits an offense if the\nperson denies the municipality reasonable access to the facility for the\npurpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by these\nregulations. (vi)\n\nIf the director\nhas been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is\ndischarged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that\nthere may be a violation of the water board regulations, or that there is a\nneed to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling\nprogram designed to verify compliance with this law or any order issued\nhereunder, then the director may seek issuance of a search warrant from any\ncourt of competent jurisdiction. (10)\n\nIllicit discharges in emergency\nsituations. (i) The director may, without\nprior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is\nnecessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may\npresent imminent and substantial danger to the environment, to the health or\nwelfare of persons, or to the MS4. The director shall notify the person of such\nsuspension within a reasonable time thereafter in writing of the reasons for\nthe suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued\nin an emergency, the director may take such steps as deemed necessary to\nprevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to\npersons. (ii)\n\nSuspension due to the\ndetection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the municipality's\nMS4 in violation of this law may have their MS4 access terminated if such\ntermination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The director will\nnotify a violator in writing of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and\nthe reasons therefor. The violator may petition the director for a\nreconsideration and hearing. Access may be granted by the director if he/she\nfinds that the illicit discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps\nto prevent its recurrence. Access may be denied if the director determines in\nwriting that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A\nperson commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises\nterminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the\ndirector. (b) Fines and damages. (1)\n\nIf any person\ndischarges wastewater into the water board POTW in violation of the provisions\nof this Part or any applicable pretreatment standards, the water board may: (i) Serve the user with written notice which\nmay be in the form of an administrative order, stating the nature of the\nviolation and providing a reasonable time limit for the satisfactory correction\nthereof. The offender shall, within the period of time stated in such notice, cease such violations. Any person who shall continue any violation beyond the\ntime limit provided shall be assessed a penalty in accordance with this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nCommence an\naction for appropriate legal and/or equitable relief including injunctions\nagainst the violative activity in any court having jurisdiction. (2)\n\nAny person determined to have\nviolated any of the provisions of this Part shall be assessed a penalty in an\namount not to exceed $10,000 per individual violation per day. (3)\n\nThe person violating any of the\nprovisions of this Part shall become liable to the water board for any expense, loss, or damage occasioned by the water board by reason of such violation. The\nexpense, loss or damage shall be taken to be to the extent determined by the\ndirector. Any contested claim for loss or damage shall be reviewable by the\nwater board. (4)\n\nAny person who\nknowingly makes any false statements, representation or certification in any\napplication, record, report, plan or other document filed or required to be\nmaintained pursuant to this Part, or SIU permit, or who falsifies, tampers\nwith, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method required\nunder this Part shall be assessed a penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000\nper violation per day. (5)\n\nIn\ndetermining the amount of any penalty for violation of this Part, the water\nboard shall consider the seriousness of the violation or violations, any\nhistory of such violations, any good faith efforts to comply with applicable\nrequirements, and such other matters as justice may require. (6)\n\nThe water board POTW shall publish\nannually in the largest local newspaper the names of users which have been in\nSNC with applicable pretreatment standards as proscribed in this Part during\nthe past 12 months. (c) Special arrangements for wastewater collection and treatment. (1)\n\nExcept as subject to the provisions of\nthe Clean Water Act and of the water board's SPDES discharge permit, and\nsection\n1960.5\nof this Part, no statement\ncontained in this Part shall be construed as preventing any special arrangement\nor agreement between the water board and any person requesting a waiver of any\nof the provisions of this Part. A request for any waiver of any of the\nprovisions of this Part must be in writing and directed to the director who\nmay, subject to the provision above, allow or deny such request by written\norder as soon as practicable. Any special agreements between the water board\nand the user shall be expressly stated in the user's wastewater discharge\npermit. (2)\n\nAn industrial facility\nlying outside the corporate limits of the city and which discharges wastewater\nof such quantity or characteristics as would cause into be classified as an SIU\nshall be so classified. (3)\n\nIn\norder that an SIU lying outside the corporate limits of the city, being served\nby the water board POTW, shall bear its share of the cost of such system, the\ncharge made for such property shall be determined by the water board upon any\nbasis authorized by water board, such charge to be collected and the collection\nenforced as herein provided for of per user charges.
