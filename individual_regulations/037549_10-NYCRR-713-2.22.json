(vii)\n\nEquipment for\nheating resident rooms, except where the facility is served by two or more\nelectrical services supplied from separate generators of a utility distribution\nnetwork having multiple power input sources and arranged to provide mechanical\nand electrical separation so that a fault between the facility and the\ngenerating sources will not likely cause an interruption of its service\nfeeders. (viii)\n\nGeneral\nillumination and selected receptacles in the vicinity of the generator\nset. (ix)\n\nPaging or speaker systems\nif intended for communication during emergency. Radio transceivers where\ninstalled for emergency use shall be capable of operating for at least one hour\nupon total failure of both normal and emergency power. (x) Alarm systems, including fire alarms\nactivated at manual stations, water flow alarm devices of sprinkler system if\nelectrically operated, fire- and smoke-detecting systems, and alarms required\nfor nonflammable medical gas systems if installed.
