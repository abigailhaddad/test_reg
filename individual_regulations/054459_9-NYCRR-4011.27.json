  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4011.27 - Pick-six jackpot pools\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nwinning pick-six jackpot wager requires selection of the first-place finisher\nin each of six designated, consecutive contests, unless otherwise provided in\nthis section. The association or corporation must obtain written approval from\nthe commission concerning the scheduling of pick-six jackpot contests, the\ndesignation of the method used, the bet minimum, the takeout rate, the\ndefinition that will be relied upon for determining the existence of a unique\nwinning ticket, the major-minor pool split and the amount of any cap to be set\non the carryover. Any changes to the approved pick-six jackpot format require\nprior approval from the commission. (b) The pick-six jackpot wager is not a\nparlay and has no connection or relation to the other betting pools for the\nrespective races. The pick-six jackpot pool shall be held entirely separate\nfrom all other pools and is no part of a daily double, exacta, quinella, trifecta, superfecta, pick-six or other wagering pool. (c) Resale of pick-six jackpot tickets from\none individual to another is prohibited, shall be grounds for ejection, and may\nbe deemed illegal gambling. (d) Races in which pick-six jackpot pools shall be conducted shall be clearly\ndesignated in the program and racing cards issued by the association or\ncorporation. (e) The design of the\npick-six jackpot tickets shall be clearly and immediately distinguishable from\nother pari-mutuel tickets. (f) Scratched horses and nonstarters. Should a programmed starter\nbe scratched or declared a nonstarter in any pick-six jackpot race before the\nstart of the first pick-six jackpot race, affected bettors may select another\nbetting interest, if a wager can be canceled and a replacement wager issued\nbefore the start of the first pick-six jackpot race, or may obtain a\ncancellation of the wager issued before the start of the first race of the\npick-six jackpot sequence. If neither option is exercised, then wagers upon\nsuch scratched or declared nonstarter shall be deemed wagers upon the\ndesignated horse for such race. The designated horse means the betting entry or\nfield upon which the most wagering money has been registered at the track in\nthe win pool at the close of win-pool betting for such race. (In the event of a\nmoney tie, the tied betting entry or field with the lowest program number shall\nbe designated.) At any time after wagering begins on the pick-six jackpot pool, should an entire betting entry or field be scratched or declared a nonstarter\nin any pick-six jackpot race, no further tickets selecting such betting entry\nor field shall be issued, and wagers upon such betting entry or field, for\npurposes of the pick-six jackpot pool, shall be deemed wagers upon the\ndesignated horse. Wagers in the pick-six jackpot pool upon an entry or field of\nhorses from which a starter or starters may have been scratched will, in the\ncase of such entry or field, be deemed wagers upon the horse or horses\nremaining in such entry or field, except at tracks with totalisator capability\nto record wagers selecting a coupled entry (or field) and wagers selecting any\nindividual constituent horses therein (merging such wagers for odds display and\npayoff purposes), in which case, the wagers upon scratched constituent horses\nwill be deemed wagers upon the designated horse in such race. In case no\nstarter remains representing any betting entry or field, wagers upon such entry\nor field shall be deemed wagers upon the designated horse in the race affected\nby the scratch. Should the balance of a betting entry or field race as a\nnon-betting starter for purposes of other pari-mutuel pools, as provided in\nsections\n4009.20\nand\n4009.21\nof this Article, wagers\nupon such entry or field shall be deemed wagers upon the designated horse for\nsuch race. Should a programmed starter be scratched or declared a nonstarter\nprior to the start of the first leg, the betting operator shall be authorized\nto refund any tickets designating betting entries affected thereby prior to\nsuch first leg. (g) Wagering tickets and winners. Except as otherwise provided in\nsubdivision (h) or subdivision (i) of this section: (1)\n\nThe pick-six jackpot pool shall be\napportioned as follows: The net pick-six jackpot pool and carryover, if any, shall be distributed to the holder of a unique winning ticket that selected the\nfirst-place finisher in each of the six designated races. (2)\n\nIf there is no unique ticket selecting\nthe first-place finisher in all six designated races, the major share of the\nnet pick-six jackpot pool shall be distributed as a single price pool to those\nwho selected the first-place finisher in the greatest number of pick-six\njackpot races, and the minor share shall be added to the carryover. (3)\n\nShould there be no wager selecting the\nwinner of at least one of the pick-six jackpot races, the day's net pool shall\nbe refunded and the previous carryover pool amount, if any, shall be carried\nover to the next scheduled corresponding pool. (4)\n\nIn obtaining authorization for operating\nthe pick-six jackpot, the association or corporation must clearly identify\nwhich of the following two definitions shall apply for determining the\nexistence of a unique winning ticket: (i) There is one and only one winning ticket that correctly selected the\nfirst-place finisher in each of the pick-six jackpot races, to be verified by\nthe unique serial number assigned by the totalisator company that issues the\nwinning ticket; or\n(ii)\n\nThe total\namount wagered on one and only one winning combination selecting the\nfirst-place finisher in each of the pick-six jackpot races, is equal to the\nminimum allowable wager. (h) Race cancellations. This\nsubdivision applies except for pick-six jackpot pools in which an intermediate\nor final distribution is to be made. The net pool shall be distributed as a\nsingle price pool to those whose selection finished first in the greatest\nnumber of pick-six jackpot races, if one or two pick-six jackpot races are\ncancelled or declared no race, non-betting or no contest after the first\npick-six jackpot race has been made official. The pick-six jackpot pool shall\nbe declared off and the gross pool refunded: (1)\nif any designated race is canceled or\ndeclared no race or non-betting before the first pick-six jackpot race is made\nofficial; or\n(2)\nif three or more\npick-six jackpot races are cancelled or declared no race, non-betting or no\ncontest. (i) Surface transfers. When the condition of a turf course\nwarrants a change of racing surface to a non-turf course in any of the pick-six\njackpot races, and such change has not been known to the public before the\nclose of wagering for the pick-six jackpot pool, then such changed race shall\nbe deemed a no contest race for pick-six jackpot wagering purposes. A no\ncontest race means a race is not to be considered as a contested race for\npick-six jackpot wagering purposes. (j) Dead heats. Each horse\nin a dead heat for win shall be considered the winner, and no allocations among\nwagers shall be made as a result thereof, unlike the practice in a pari-mutuel\nwin pool. The payoff price per dollar shall be the same for each class of\nwinning wager. (k) Carryovers. Carryovers from prior pick-six jackpot pools, advertised guaranteed amounts or advertised added amounts will be distributed\nto winners in such day's pick-six jackpot pools, provided that there are no\ncancelled or no-contest races in the pick-six jackpot sequence and no\nintermediate or final distribution is to be made. (l) Intermediate\ndistributions. Prior to the last two weeks of a race meeting at a\ntrack, a date and program approved by the commission may be announced by the\ntrack operator at which (provided no one thereafter has the only wager that\ncorrectly selects the winners of all six designated races) accumulated\ncarryovers will be added to the net pool distributable to wagers selecting the\nwinners of the most races of the pick six jackpot pool conducted on such\nprogram. Distributing the pick-six jackpot carryover requires a written request\nfor permission submitted for Commission approval. The request must contain\njustification for the distribution, an explanation of the benefit to be derived\nand intended date of the distribution. If all pick-six jackpot races on the\nprogram designated for intermediate distribution are canceled, or the pick-six\njackpot pool is refunded, a pick-six jackpot pool shall be conducted on the\nnext available race date with entries not yet carded. If no further programs\nare conducted at the race meeting, a pick-six jackpot pool shall be conducted\non the first program of the next meeting conducted at such track by such track\noperator to provide for final distribution for such prior meeting. An\nintermediate distribution also may be directed at any time at the commission's\ndiscretion, upon three days' notice by the commission, so long as entries have\nnot yet been carded. (m) Final distribution. The track shall select, with the approval\nof the commission, a date and program during the final week of the annual\nassigned racing dates of the track operator, and also during the year during\nthe final week of a meeting at a track after which such track operator will\noperate at another track, when there shall be a final distribution of all\naccumulated carryovers. The unique-wager provision of this section (set forth\nin paragraph (1) of subdivision (g) of this section) shall be suspended, and\nthe entire pool shall be distributed as a single-price pool to those whose\nselection finished first in the greatest number of pick-six jackpot races. Thereafter, no pick-six jackpot pools are permitted to be conducted during such\nweek. In the event that all pick-six jackpot races on the program designated\nfor final distribution are cancelled, or the pick-six jackpot pool is refunded, and no further programs are conducted at the meeting, the commission shall\nrequire that a pick-six jackpot pool be conducted on the first program of the\nnext race meeting conducted at such track by such track operator to provide for\nfinal distribution for such prior meeting. The commission also may order a\nfinal distribution for an earlier time in the commission's\ndiscretion. (n) The association or\ncorporation may suspend previously approved pick-six jackpot wagering with the\nprior approval of the commission. Any carryover shall be held until\nthe-suspended pick-six jackpot wagering is reinstated. An association or\ncorporation may request approval of a pick-six jackpot wager or separate\nwagering pool for specific performances. (o) [Reserved]. (p) In the event of occurrences not\nencompassed within the explicit provisions of this section, distribution shall\nbe formulated on the basis of established pari-mutuel practice and in\naccordance with the distribution philosophy set forth in this section; provided, nevertheless, that if full distribution of the pool is made on the\nbasis of outstanding tickets, then the method of formulation announced by the\ntrack and the basis upon which payments have been made shall be deemed\nconclusively correct and not subject to review. (q) Posting of winning\ncombinations. Every pick-six jackpot wagering combination entitled to\na payoff shall be posted publicly by the track operator together with the\npayoff price. (r) Non-transferability. Pick-six jackpot tickets shall be\nnontransferable, and violations of this subdivision may lead to confiscation\nand cancellation of such tickets in addition to other disciplinary\naction. (s) Betting\ninformation. Unless otherwise ordered by the commission, information\nconcerning combinations wagered upon or not wagered upon in a pick-six jackpot\npool shall not be disclosed by the totalisator operator, or otherwise, until\nthe final pick-six jackpot race remains as the only race to be contested for\ncompletion of the pick-six jackpot wager. The operation of the totalisator\nequipment and reports generated thereby, as well as the communication of any\ninformation concerning such pool, shall be subject to the strict supervision of\nthe commission. (t) No\nreduction in guaranteed distributions. Advertised added monies or\nminimum distributions shall not apply to intermediate or final distributions, unless a wager correctly selects winners of all six designated races, or five\nwinners and no more than one all-win of the pick-six pool. A guaranteed minimum\ndistribution or guaranteed added money amount, once advertised, may not be\nreduced and shall continue to be guaranteed by the track operator for every\npick-six pool for the balance of the meeting. (u) Interfacing of off-track\nwagers. Interfacing of off-track wagers shall be accomplished\naccording to procedures approved by the commission. In the event there is a\nfailure to interface all such wagers with on-track wagers in accordance with\nsuch procedures, the procedure for distribution of the pool and computation of\npayoff prices shall be approved by the commission. (v) Trust funds. Carry-over\nmonies shall be held in a separate account in trust by track operators for the\nbenefit of participants in pick-six pools until distributed. (w) Seed money or insurance\nallocation. A percentage designated by the track operator and approved\nby the commission, not exceeding two percent of the total daily pick-six\njackpot pool wagering, shall be held apart by the track operator from the\ntakeout of each pick-six jackpot pool to reimburse such track operator for the\ncost of any insurance it may secure to guarantee minimum distributions to\nwinners of such pools, or to reimburse a track operator for funds such track\noperator expends for added money or guaranteed minimum distributions to winners\nof such pools. Any accumulation of such allocations not necessary to reimburse\na track for expenditures actually incurred for such purposes shall be added to\nthe amounts distributable in the pool designated for final distribution for the\nmeeting. (x) Copies of this section\nshall be made available free of charge by the track to the public in the public\nbetting area of the track. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
