Tit. 3 § 112.1 - General statement\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis Supervisory Procedure is designed to provide the\n\nSuperintendent of Banks with detailed information concerning the planned\nclosings of branch offices by State-chartered banking organizations, the\navailability of alternative financial services within the general area served\nby such branches, and the economic impact upon the community resulting from\nsuch closings, and to provide the superintendent with authority to conduct\nmeetings with banking organizations and community groups in areas where a\nbranch closing is planned. A sale or other transfer of a branch office which\ndoes not result in any material reduction in the financial services offered at\nsuch location shall not be deemed to be a closing of such branch, notwithstanding the fact that the ownership of such branch has been transferred\nfrom a banking organization to another banking institution. Provided that the\nreport and notice are given as required in sections 112.2 and\n112.3\nof this Procedure, nothing\ncontained in this Procedure shall prevent a banking organization from closing a\nbranch.
