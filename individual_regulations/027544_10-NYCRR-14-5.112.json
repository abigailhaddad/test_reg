Tit. 10 §§ 14-5.112 - Definition of sanitization; general requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Sanitization is effective bactericidal treatment by heat or chemical means, acceptable to the permit-issuing official, which destroys pathogens on surfaces treated. (b) The following are acceptable methods of sanitizing: (1)\nimmersion for at least one-half minute in clean hot water at a temperature of not less than 170° F (76.7° C); (2)\nimmersion for at least one minute in a clean solution containing at least 50 parts per million of available chlorine at a temperature of at least 75° F (23.9° C); (3)\nimmersion for at least one minute in a clean solution containing at least 12.5 parts per million of available iodine and having pH not higher than 5.0, and at a temperature of at least 75° F (23.9° C); (4)\nimmersion in a clean solution containing any other chemical sanitizing agent, acceptable to the State Commissioner of Health, that will provide the equivalent bactericidal effect of a solution containing at least 50 parts per million of available chlorine as hypochlorite at a temperature of at least 75° F (23.9° C) for one minute; or\n(5)\nswabbing with a solution of at least twice the strength required for that sanitizing solution when used for immersion. (c) Chemicals used for sanitizing are not to have concentrations which will leave toxic residues on surfaces treated. A test kit or other device is to be provided and used that accurately measures the parts-per-million concentration of the solution used. (d) Chemicals, heat or other process used for sanitizing is to produce an average plate count per utensil surface examined of not more than 100 colonies and free from coliform organisms. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n14-5.112\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
