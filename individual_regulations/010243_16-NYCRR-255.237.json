Tit. 16 § 255.237 - Preheating\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Carbon steel\nthat has a carbon content in excess of 0.32 percent (heat analysis) or a carbon\nequivalent (C + 1/4 Mn) of 0.65 percent (heat analysis) must he preheated for\nwelding. (b) Carbon steel that has\na lower carbon content or carbon equivalent than the steels covered by\nsubdivision (a) of this section must be preheated for welding when preheating\nwill alleviate existing conditions that would limit the welding technique or\ntend to adversely affect the quality of the weld. (c) When steel materials with different\npreheat temperatures are being preheated for welding, the higher temperature\nmust be used. (d) Preheating may be\naccomplished by any suitable method, provided that it is uniform and that the\ntemperature does not fall below the prescribed minimum during the actual\nwelding operation. (e) Preheat\ntemperature must be monitored to ensure that the required preheat temperature\nis reached before, and maintained during, the welding operation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.237\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
