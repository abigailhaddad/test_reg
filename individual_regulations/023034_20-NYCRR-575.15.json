  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 575.15 - Determination of tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1411, 1420\n(a) If the required return is not filed, or\nif a filed return is incorrect or incomplete, the department will determine the\ntax due from whatever records and information are available, including the\nassessed valuation of the real property or interest therein and other\nappropriate factors. Notice of such determination will be given to the person\nliable for the payment of the tax. (b) The provisions of the Civil Practice Law\nand Rules, or any other law relative to limitations of time for the enforcement\nof a civil remedy, do not apply to any proceeding or action taken by New York\n\nState or the Commissioner to levy, appraise, assess, determine or enforce the\ncollection of any tax or penalty provided by Article 31 of the Tax Law. No\ndetermination of tax due shall be made after the expiration of more than three\nyears from the date of the filing of a return; provided, however, that where no\nreturn has been filed as provided by law or in the case of a willfully false or\nfraudulent return, the tax may be assessed at any time. (c) Where, before the expiration of the\nperiod prescribed for the determination of tax due, a taxpayer has consented in\nwriting that such period be extended, the amount of any tax due may be\ndetermined at any time within such extended period. The period so extended may\nbe further extended by subsequent consents in writing made before the\nexpiration of the extended period. (d) The notice of determination finally and\nirrevocably fixes the tax unless: (1)\n\nThe\nperson assessed petitions the Division of Tax Appeals for a hearing within 90\ndays from the date of the notice; or\n(2)\n\nThe department redetermines the amount of\ntax due. In any case before the Division of Tax Appeals, the burden of proof is\non the petitioner. After a hearing has been held, the Division of Tax Appeals\nshall provide copies of the determination of the administrative law judge to\nthe petitioner and to the department. The determination of the administrative\nlaw judge may be reviewed by the Tax Appeals Tribunal as provided by section\n2006.7 of the Tax Law. Furthermore, the petitioner can petition for a judicial\nreview of the decision of the Tax Appeals Tribunal as provided by section\n2016\nof the Tax Law. (See Part 3000 of this Title.)\n(e) Before the petitioner can initiate a\nproceeding for judicial review, the petitioner must first deposit the tax, penalties and interest due with the department and also file with the\ndepartment an undertaking in such amount and with such sureties as a justice of\nthe Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding is\ndismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner will pay all costs and charges\nwhich may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding. At the option of the\npetitioner, such undertaking filed with the department may be in a sum\nsufficient to cover the taxes, penalties and interest thereon stated in such\ndetermination plus the costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of\nthe proceeding, in which event the petitioner shall not be required to deposit\nsuch taxes, penalties and interest as a condition precedent to the\napplication. (f) A person liable\nfor the tax may consent to have the tax due finally and irrevocably fixed, prior to the ninety-day period referred to in subdivision (d) of this section, by filing with the department a signed consent statement on such form as the\ndepartment prescribes. The signed consent statement may be filed whether or not\na determination of tax pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section has been\nissued by the department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
