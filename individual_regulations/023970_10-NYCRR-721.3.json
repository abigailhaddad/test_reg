The\nsurface travel time to reach a Level II hospital, a Level III hospital, or an\nRPC within the geographic area or affiliative perinatal network, under usual\ntravel conditions shall be no more than two hours. Transfer decisions must be\nbased on the appropriate level of perinatal care required, and care shall be\nprovided at a hospital offering the appropriate level of care which is\naccessible and convenient to the mother's place of residence whenever\nfeasible; (6)\nthe geographic\ndistribution of designated hospitals throughout the state to ensure access to\nappropriate levels of care throughout the state; and\n(7)\nsuch other additional information as the\ncommissioner may require to make the designation. (b) Designation process. (1)\n\nEach hospital certified to provide\nperinatal services shall complete a designation survey by the department and\nverify specific data about its maternal and newborn discharges. The department\nshall assess the results of the survey and data in order to assign a\ndesignation. The department may require an on-site review of services at a\nhospital before making a designation, in which case the hospital shall\nparticipate and cooperate in the review and provide any additional information\nrequested. A hospital shall receive its designation only after this process is\ncomplete and the department has obtained and considered all relevant\ninformation to its satisfaction. (2)\n\nThe perinatal designation of a hospital\nshall appear on the hospital's operating certificate. (3)\n\nPerinatal designation on the maternity\ninformation leaflet. The hospital's perinatal designation and a brief\ndefinition of the Level shall be included in the maternity information leaflet\ndistributed to each prospective maternity patient, pursuant to Public Health\n\nLaw section 2803-j(1). (c) Redesignations. (1)\nA hospital may apply to change its\ndesignation no sooner than one year following its most recent\ndesignation. (2)\n\nThe department may\ninitiate a review and monitor compliance with the definitions, standards and\ncriteria set forth in this Part by perinatal services and RPCs at any\ntime. (3)\n\nThe department may change\na designation if it finds that a hospital perinatal service or RPC no longer\nmeets the definition, standards and criterion for its current\ndesignation. (4)\n\nMaintenance of\nminimum volume standards. To ensure that service capability and staff\ncompetence are maintained for Level II, Level III, or an RPC, a hospital which\nfails to meet minimum volume standards and is seeking to maintain its\ndesignation, or applying for another designation, shall present evidence that\nthe annual minimum volume standards will be achieved within one year following\nthe decision to allow the hospital to remain at the present level of\ndesignation or the initiation of the new designation. Minimum volume standards\nmay be waived by the department if the department determines that a waiver will\nimprove access while maintaining high quality care. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
