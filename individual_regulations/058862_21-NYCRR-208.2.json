  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 208.2 - Leases\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Leases for the\nright to construct and/or maintain and operate fiber optic equipment may be\ngranted under the authority of section\n528\n(9)\nof the Public Authorities Law and shall\nbe limited to a period of no more than 10 years from the date on which they are\nmade. (b) The authority shall seek\nseparate proposals for each of its Hudson River facilities, except that the\n\nNewburgh-Beacon Bridge and the parallel Newburgh-Beacon Bridge may be deemed to\nbe a single facility for the purposes of this Part. Proposers seeking access to\nmore than one bridge may reply with a single proposal containing separate\ntechnical details rather than a separate proposal for each facility. Nothing\nherein shall be construed to prohibit any transportation corporation from being\nawarded leases to use more than one facility. (c) Unless engineering, bridge maintenance or\nmaintenance of traffic considerations require otherwise, the authority will not\naward an exclusive lease for sole access to any bridge by any lessee. In order\nto avoid interference with its regular operations, however, the authority does\nreserve the right to refrain, after the award of any lease or leases for access\nto any bridge, from the award of additional leases for access to the same\nbridge up to but not exceeding a period of 10 years. (d) The authority may also accept proposals\nfrom and award leases to two or more transportation corporations acting as a\njoint venture. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n208.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
