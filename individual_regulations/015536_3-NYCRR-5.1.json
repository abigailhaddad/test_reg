  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 5.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn order to maintain and enhance the safety and soundness of\nforeign banks' New York offices, the Banking Board is establishing criteria\nwhich would require under certain circumstances that such offices utilize\nindependent external and internal auditors satisfactory to the superintendent. The Banking Board believes that the foreign bank office's annual ROC-A\nexamination rating serves as a straightforward and meaningful measure to\ndetermine whether foreign bank offices require such additional assistance. Nothing contained in this Part shall be deemed to limit the authority of the\nsuperintendent under the provisions of the Banking Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n5.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
