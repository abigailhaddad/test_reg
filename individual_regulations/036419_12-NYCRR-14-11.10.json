  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-11.10 - Safety valves\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each miniature boiler shall be equipped with a sealed spring-loaded pop safety\nvalve not less than one-half inch in diameter. Where there is no extraction of\nsteam (closed system), a safety fracturing disk may be used in addition to the\nspring-loaded pop safety valve. (b) Each safety valve shall be plainly marked by the manufacturer in such a way\nthat the markings will not be obliterated in service. The markings may be\nstamped on the casing, or stamped or cast on a plate or plates securely\nfastened to the casing, and shall comply with sections 14-9.4 to\n14-9.15, inclusive, of this\n\nPart. (c) The safety valve or\nvalves shall be connected to the boiler independently of any other steam\nconnection, without any unnecessary intervening pipe or fitting. Such\nintervening pipe or fitting, if unavoidable, shall be not longer than the\ncorresponding face-to-face dimension of a tee fitting of the same diameter, and\nthe minimum opening therethrough shall be at least equal to the area of the\nvalve inlet. No valve of any description shall be placed between the safety\nvalve or valves and the boiler, nor on the discharge pipe from the safety valve\nto the atmosphere. (d) To insure\nthe safety valve being free, each valve shall have a substantial lifting device\nby which the valve disk may be lifted from its seat when there is at least 75\npercent of full working pressure in the boiler. All safety valves shall be\nmounted with their spindles vertical in an upright position and freely\naccessible. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-11.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
