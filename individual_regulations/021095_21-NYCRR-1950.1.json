Tit. 21 § 1950.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Unless the\ncontext specifically indicates otherwise, the meaning of terms used in this\n\nPart shall be as follows: (1)\n\nAcceptable\nbackflow prevention device means an air gap, reduced pressure zone device or\ndouble-check valve assembly, as used to contain potential contamination within\na facility, acceptable to the director. (2)\n\nAct or Water Board Act means the Niagara\n\nFalls Water Authority Act, codified as section 1230-a et seq. of titles 10-B\nand 10-C of article 5 of the Public Authorities Law. (3)\n\nAesthetically objectionable facility\nmeans a facility in which substances are present which, if introduced into the\npublic water supply system, could be a nuisance to other water customers but, would not adversely affect human health. Typical examples of such substances\nare: food grade dyes, hot water, stagnant water from fire lines in which no\nchemical additives are used, and similar substances as the director may\ndetermine from time to time. (4)\n\nAir gap separation means a physical separation between the discharge end of a\npotable water supply and an open or nonpressure receiving vessel. An accepted\nair gap separation shall be at least double the diameter of the supply pipe\nmeasured vertically above the flood rim of the vessel, in no case less than one\ninch. (5)\n\nApproved water supply\nmeans any water supply approved by a public health agency of the State or its\npolitical subdivisions where the property serviced by such supply is\nlocated. (6)\n\nBackflow means the\nflow of water or other liquids, mixtures, or substances into the distributing\npipes of a potable supply of water from any source or sources other than its\nintended source. Back-siphonage is one type of backflow. (7)\n\nBack-siphonage means backflow resulting\nfrom negative pressure in the distributing pipes of a potable water\nsupply. (8)\n\nBoard or water board\nmeans the Niagara Falls Water Board established pursuant to section 1231-b of\nthe Water Board Act, and its directors, employees, agents, together with any\nauthorized contractor or any other person acting with written authority on\nbehalf of the board.

(12)\n\nCity means the City of Niagara Falls, NY, its employees and agents, together\nwith any authorized contractor and any other person acting with written\nauthority on behalf of the city. (13)\n\nContainment means cross-connection\ncontrol which isolates the user's entire facility from the public water system\nso as to provide the protection necessary to prevent contamination of the\npublic water supply in the event of backflow from the user's\nfacility. (14)\n\nContamination means\nthe presence of any foreign substance (organic, inorganic, radiological, or\nbiological) in water that tends to degrade its quality so as to constitute a\nhazard or impair the usefulness of the water. (15)\n\nCross-connection means any physical\nconnection between a potable water supply and any waste pipe, soil pipe, sewer, drain, or any unapproved source or system. It includes any potable water supply\noutlet which is submerged or can be submerged in wastewater and/or any other\nsource of contamination. (16)\n\nDirector and department mean, without other designation, the executive director\nof the water board, or other person or persons designated by the director to\nact in his or her stead, and the department of water facilities of the water\nboard, respectively. (17)\n\nDouble-check valve assembly means an assembly of at least two independently\nacting acceptable check valves, including tightly closing shutoff valves\nlocated at each end of the assembly with suitable connections for testing the\nwater tightness of each check valve.

(19)\n\nHealth hazard\nmeans any conditions, devices, or practices in the water supply system and its\noperation which create or, in the judgment of the director may create a danger\nto the health and well-being of the user. An example of a health hazard is a\nstructural defect in the water supply system whether of location, design, or\nconstruction that regularly or occasionally may prevent satisfactory\npurification of the water supply or cause it to be polluted from extraneous\nsources. (20)\n\nPerson means any\nnatural person, firm, trustee, executor, personal representative, partnership, association, limited partnership, limited liability company, limited liability\npartnership, joint venture or corporation, or other legal entity whatsoever. The masculine gender shall include the feminine, and the singular shall include\nthe plural where indicated by the context.

This definition includes any devices and systems used in the\nstorage, treatment, recycling and reclamation of sewage or industrial wastes of\na liquid nature and any sewers, pipes, conveyances and appurtenances that\ntransport wastewater to or from the water board's treatment plant. For the\npurposes of these regulations, POTW shall also include any sewers that\ntransport wastewater to the POTW from persons outside the water board's service\narea who are, by contract or agreement with the water board, users of the water\nboard's publicly-owned treatment works.

During normal\nflow and at the cessation of normal flow the pressure between these two checks\nshall be less than the upstream (supply) pressure. In case of leakage of either\ncheck valve, the differential relief valve, by discharging to the atmosphere, shall operate to maintain the pressure between the checks at less than the\nsupply pressure. The unit must include tightly closing shutoff valves located\nat each end of the device, and each device shall be fitted with properly\nlocated test cocks. (24)\n\nSignificant industrial user means any person who: (i) discharges wastewater subject to\ncategorical pretreatment standards under\n40 CFR\n403.6\nand 40 CFR chapter I, subchapter\nN; or\n(ii)\ndischarges an average of\n25,000 gallons per day, or more of process wastewater to the water board's\npublicly owned treatment works (POTW) (excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling\nand boiler blowdown wastewater); contributes a process wastestream which makes\nup five percent or more of the average dry weather hydraulic or organic\ncapacity of the water board's POTW treatment plant; or is designated as such by\nthe control authority as defined in\n40 CFR\n403.12(a)\non the basis that\nthe industrial user has a reasonable potential for adversely affecting the\nwater board's POTW operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or\nrequirement.
