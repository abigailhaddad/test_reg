(c) Procedure for dealing the cards. (1)\n\nAll cards used in Spanish 21 shall be\ndealt from a dealing shoe specifically designed for such purpose and located on\nthe table to the left of the dealer. (2)\n\nThe dealer shall remove cards from the\nshoe with the dealer's left hand, turn the cards face up, and then place the\ncards on the appropriate area of the layout with the dealer's right hand, except that the dealer has the option to deal cards to the first two betting\npositions with the dealer's left hand. (3)\n\nAfter each full set of cards is placed in\nthe shoe, the dealer shall remove the first card from the shoe face down and\nplace such card in the discard rack. Each new dealer who comes to the table\nshall also burn one card as set forth in this paragraph before the new dealer\ndeals any cards to the players. The burn card shall be disclosed if requested\nby a player. (4)\n\nAt the\ncommencement of each round of play, the dealer shall, starting on the dealer's\nleft and continuing around the table, deal the cards in the following order: (i) one card face up to each box on the\nlayout in which a wager is contained; (ii)\none card face up to the\ndealer; (iii)\na second card face up\nto each box on the layout in which a wager is contained; and\n(iv)\none card face down to the dealer, which\nshall be known as the hole card. The gaming facility may, in its discretion, choose to\ndeliver all determinate cards to the player before the dealer receives the\ndealer's second card. (5)\n\nAfter two cards have been dealt to each\nplayer, the dealer shall, beginning from the dealer's left, announce the point\ntotal of each player. As each player's point total is announced, such player\nshall indicate whether the player wishes to surrender, double down, split\npairs, stand or draw, as provided for by this Part. (6)\n\nAs each player indicates a decision, the\ndealer shall deal face up whatever additional cards are necessary to effectuate\nsuch decision consistent with this section and shall announce the new point\ntotal of such player after each additional card is dealt. (7)\n\nAfter decisions of each player have been\nimplemented and all additional cards have been dealt, the dealer shall expose\nthe dealer's hole card. Any additional cards required to be dealt to the hand\nof the dealer shall be dealt face up. After the dealer's hand has been\ncompleted, the dealer shall announce the point count. If the gaming facility\nchooses to deliver all determinate cards to the player before the dealer\nreceives the dealer's second card, the dealer shall remove the next card from\nthe dealing shoe and place such card face up on the layout next to the dealer's\nhole card. (d) Spanish\n21 match the dealer wager. A gaming facility may provide a match the dealer\nwager as an additional wager. (1)\nA player's\nmatch the dealer wager shall not affect the player's wager on the underlying\nhand. A dealer's blackjack shall have no effect on a player's match the dealer\nwager. The match the dealer wager shall be available only on tables using a\nsix- or eight-deck multi-shuffle device. (2)\n\nPrior to the first card being dealt for\neach round of play, each player who has placed a Spanish 21 wager may make a\nmatch the dealer wager by placing chips or plaques on the designated area of\nthe Spanish 21 layout. The minimum and maximum wagers permitted by the gaming\nfacility shall be inscribed on the table layout or posted on a sign at each\ntable offering the match the dealer wager. (3)\n\nThe dealer shall then announce, \"no more\nbets\" and deal the initial two cards to all players and the dealer. Prior to\nany additional cards being dealt to any player at the table and before any card\nreader device is used, the dealer shall, starting with the player farthest to\nthe dealer's right and continuing counter-clockwise around the table, settle in\nsuccession all match the dealer wagers by collecting all losing wagers and\npaying all winning wagers. (4)\nA\nmatch the dealer wager shall be paid when either of the player's initial two\ncards match the dealer's initial card. Any card with a point value of 10 (jack, queen, king) shall be deemed a match only if the cards are of identical\ndescription (e.g., jack-jack, queen-queen, or king-king, but not jack-queen, etc.). If both of the initial cards dealt to a player match the dealer's\ninitial card, the player shall be paid for each card. (5)\nA gaming facility shall post its match\nthe dealer wager pay table at each Spanish 21 table offering the match the\ndealer wager. A gaming facility may change pay tables at such facility's\ndiscretion at any time after the conclusion of a round of play, upon prior\nnotice to the commission. A gaming facility may choose from one of the\nfollowing pay tables for the match the dealer wager: Hand: Pay table A (six decks)\n\nPay table B (eight decks)\n\nEach matching card of a different\nsuit\n4:1\n3:1\n\nEach matching card of the same\nsuit\n9:1\n12:1\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
