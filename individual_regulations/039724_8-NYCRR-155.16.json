(c) The commissioner will rank all\ngrant applications according to the degree of imminent hazard to health\npresented by the asbestos materials, using an exposure assessment scale. The\nexposure assessment scale shall be based on the nature and magnitude of the\nexisting and potential hazards presented by the asbestos materials, and shall\ntake into account the following factors: (1)\nthe nature and condition of the asbestos material, including the degree of\nfriability and asbestos content; (2)\nthe extent of damage to the asbestos\nmaterial, including water damage; (3)\nthe exposed surface area; (4)\nthe accessibility of the asbestos\nmaterial; (5)\nthe degree of\nactivity and movement of the material; and\n(6)\nthe degree of exposure to an air plenum\nor direct air stream.

Grant applications\nwhich receive the highest ranking will be approved first, and, subject to the\navailability of funds, additional applications will be approved in the\ndescending order of their ranking on the exposure assessment scale. In the\nevent that two or more applications have identical rankings on the exposure\nassessment scale and sufficient funds are not available for all such\napplications, the commissioner may, to the extent that funds are available, approve such applications or combination of applications as will, in the\njudgment of the commissioner, result in the abatement of an imminent hazard to\nthe health of the greatest number of persons. (e) Grants shall be awarded for amounts of 60\npercent of approved costs.
