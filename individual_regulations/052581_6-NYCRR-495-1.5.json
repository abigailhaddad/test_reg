  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 495-1.5 - GIE Emissions Limit\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Beginning\n\nJanuary 1, 2030, a GIE owner's rolling 3-year average GIE emissions as\ncalculated pursuant to section 495-1.7(a)-(c) of this Part and subject to\ndepartment approval per section 495-1.8 of this Part, cannot exceed their\nemissions limit calculated as follows. (b) Baseline System Capacity. GIE owners must\ncalculate their baseline system capacity for each covered insulating gas for\nthe first reporting year as follows. Click\nto view image\nwhere: Cbl,j is the baseline system capacity in pounds for\ncovered insulating gas j in the first reporting year; n is the number of GIE devices k that were active GIE\ninsulated with covered insulating gas j at some point during the first\nreporting year; dk,j is the number of days during the first reporting\nyear that GIE device k with covered insulating gas j was in active\nservice; Ck,j is the covered insulating gas at activation in\npounds for covered insulating gas j of GIE device k; and\nD is the number of days in the first reporting\nyear. (c) Baseline CO2e\n\nCapacity. GIE owners must calculate their baseline CO2e capacity for each\ncovered insulating gas j for the first reporting year as follows: Click\nto view image\nwhere: CO2ebl,j is the baseline CO2e capacity for each covered\ninsulating gas j expressed as metric tons CO\n2\ne in the\nfirst reporting year; m is the number of covered insulating gases j; GWPj is the GWP20 of the covered insulating gas j; Cbl,j is the baseline system capacity calculated pursuant\nto section 495-1.5(b) of this Part; and\n2204.62 is the number of pounds in a metric ton. (d) Emissions Limit. GIE owners\nshall establish their emissions limit using the following formula: Click\nto view image\nwhere: Emissions Limit is the GIE Owner's emissions limit in\nmetric tons CO2e; EF is the appropriate emission factor from section\n495-1.5(e) of this Part; and\nCO2ebl,j is the baseline CO2e capacity as calculated\npursuant to section 495-1.5(c) of this Part. (e) The emissions factor (EF) for years 2030\nthrough 2034 shall be 1.0, and 0.95 for 2035 and each subsequent\nyear. (f) Combining of GIE Owners. Whenever multiple GIE owners combine to be under the same GIE owner, the GIE\nowner's new emissions limit will be the sum of the emission limits that would\nhave been established for each GIE owner had the GIE owners not combined. All\nGIE owners who have combined must notify the department that the combination\nhas occurred within 30 days of the effective date of the combination. The\nnotification must include the date of the combination, the names and\nidentification numbers (if assigned) of the GIE owners who combined, the name\nof the new GIE owner following the combination, the emission limits previously\nassigned to each GIE owner, the new GIE owner's emissions limit, the reason(s)\nfor the change, a description of the relationship between the entities being\ncombined (e.g., that they have a common parent organization), and the\nappropriate attestation statement from section 495-1.8(c) of this\n\nPart. (g) Splitting of a GIE Owner. Whenever a GIE owner splits into multiple GIE owners, the emissions limit that\nwould have been assigned to the original GIE owner must be split and assigned\nto the new GIE owners proportionally based on each new GIE owner's equity share\nof the original system's capacity at the time of the split, calculated pursuant\nto section 495-1.6 of this Part. All GIE owners who have split from a former\nGIE owner must notify the department that the split has occurred within 30 days\nof the effective date of the split. The notification must include the date of\nthe split, the name and identification number (if assigned) of the GIE owner\nthat split, the names of the new GIE owners following the split, the emissions\nlimit previously assigned to the GIE owner that split, the new GIE owner's\nbaseline CO2e capacity at the time of the split, the new GIE owner's emissions\nlimit, the reason(s) for the change, a description of the relationship between\nthe entities being split (e.g., that they have a common parent organization but\nare independent limited liability companies), and the appropriate attestation\nstatement from section 495-1.8(c) of this Part. (h) The department will evaluate compliance\nwith the emissions limit through the reporting requirements described in\nsection 495-1.8 of this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n495-1.5\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 24, 2024/Volume XLVI, Issue 52, eff. 1/9/2025\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
