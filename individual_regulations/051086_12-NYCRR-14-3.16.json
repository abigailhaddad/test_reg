  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-3.16 - Welded patches\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Flush patches. The weld around a flush patch shall be a full penetration weld\nand the accessible surfaces shall be ground flush where required by the\napplicable section of the ASME Code. The welds shall be subjected to the\nnondestructive examination method used in the original construction or an\nacceptable alternate. Flush welded patches shall be applied as specified in\n\nFigure 14-3.17-1 or by other equivalent methods. (b) Tube patches. In some situations, it is\nnecessary to weld a flush patch on a tube, such as replacement of tube sections\nresulting in the restriction of accessibility around the complete circumference\nof the tube, or when it is necessary to repair a small bulge. This is referred\nto as a window patch. Window patches shall be applied as specified in Figure\n14-3.17-2 or by other equivalent methods. (c) Lapped and fillet welded patches. Lapped\nand fillet welded patches may be applied provided they are not exposed to\nradiant heat. Lapped and fillet welded patches shall be applied on the pressure\nside of the sheet. Lapped and fillet welded patches shall have a minimum lap of\n1/2 inch. If the area to be patched includes a riveted seam, rivets shall be\nremoved before the patch is applied and new rivets driven before the patch is\nwelded at the edges. New staybolts shall be installed in the patched area, and\nthe heads of the staybolts shall be covered by welding. FIGURE 14-3.17(1)\nFLUSH PATCHES\nImage\n\nBefore installing a flush patch, the defective metal\nshall be removed until sound metal is reached. The patch shall be rolled or\npressed to the proper shape or curvature. The edges shall align without\noverlap. In stayed areas, the weld seams shall come between\nstaybolt rows and riveted seams. Patches shall be made from material that is at least\nequal in quality and thickness to the original material. Patches may be of any shape or size. Corners of patches\nshall have a radius of such size as is necessary to avoid creating a stress\npoint. FIGURE 14-3.17(2)\nTUBE WINDOW PATCHING METHOD\nImage\n\nIt may be necessary to weld a flush patch on a tube, since in some situations, accessibility around the complete circumference of\nthe tube is restricted. Window patches shall be applied as follows: a. The patch shall be made from tube material\nof the same type, diameter and thickness as the one being repaired. b. Fitup of the patch is important to weld\nintegrity. The root opening shall be uniform around the patch. c. The gas tungsten arc welding process shall\nbe used for the initial pass on the inside of the tube and for the initial pass\njoining the patch to the tube. d. The balance of the weld may be completed by any appropriate welding\nprocess. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-3.16\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
