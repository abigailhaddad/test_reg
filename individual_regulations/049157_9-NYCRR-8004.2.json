  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8004.2 - Review of Condition Violation, Initial Actions and Case Designation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a parole\nofficer having charge of a releasee shall have probable cause to believe that\nsuch person has violated one or more of the conditions of their release in an\nimportant respect, the officer shall report such fact to a member of the board\nor a designated officer. Designated officer shall mean a senior parole officer, supervising parole officer, deputy regional director, regional director, deputy\ndirector of operations, the director of operations, chief of the parole\nviolation unit, assistant chief of the parole violation unit, and any officer\nwho has been provided with specific authorization by the Board of\n\nParole. (b) Probable cause exists\nwhen evidence or information which appears reliable discloses facts or\ncircumstances that would convince a person of ordinary intelligence, judgment\nand experience that it is more probable than not that the subject releasee has\ncommitted the acts in question. Such apparently reliable evidence may include\nhearsay. (c) Where there is\nprobable cause to believe that a releasee has violated one or more of the\nconditions of their release in an important respect, a notice of violation may\nbe issued. A notice of violation may be approved for prosecution and issuance\nby any member of the Board or a designated officer. (d) Subject to the further requirements set\nforth in this Part and Part 8005 of this Title, a warrant for retaking and\ntemporary detention may issue when there is probable cause to believe that the\nreleasee has violated one or more of the conditions of their release in an\nimportant respect. A warrant for retaking and temporary detention may be issued\nby any member of the Board or a designated officer, except that no officer\nshall issue a warrant in a case where they are the one who furnishes the report\nupon which it is based, including those cases wherein the notice of violation\nhad been approved at a time wherein warrant issuance was not\nexpected. (e) The written violation\nof release report or an attendant form shall identify and designate the case as\neither a non-technical or technical violation matter, and when a technical\nviolation matter, include explanation as to whether reincarceration is possible\nat the conclusion of the parole revocation case. Such designation may be\nappropriately modified at any time. The designation will be as follows: (1)\n\nTechnical violation case, no\nreincarceration. This is the designation for a case involving only technical\nviolations by the releasee, for which no periods of reincarceration / time\nassessments may be imposed should all charges be sustained at a final parole\nrevocation hearing. (2)\n\nTechnical\nviolation case, reincarceration possible. This is the designation for a case\ninvolving only technical violations by the releasee, but wherein\nreincarceration is possible if at least one of the current charges is sustained\nat a final revocation hearing. The Department should provide explanation to\ninclude identification of both the current charge(s) and prior sustained\nviolation(s), if any, that forms the specific factual basis for this\ndesignation, as well as the permissible periods of reincarceration possible in\nthe current case. (3)\n\nNon-technical\nviolation case. This is the designation for a case that meets the definition of\nnontechnical violation provided in section\n8000.2\nof this Title, and in such\ncircumstance, it shall be made notwithstanding the inclusion of technical\nviolation charges. (f) The case designation required by subdivision (e) of this section shall not\ncontrol any aspect of the disposition of a parole revocation case, and any\nnon-compliance with the requirements of that subdivision or any other errors\nwith respect to the case designation or modifications thereof, shall not\nprovide basis for the vacating of a notice of violation or warrant or for any\nother form of dismissal of the case.
