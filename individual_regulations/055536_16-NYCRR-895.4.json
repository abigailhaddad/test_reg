(4)\n\nWaiver requests regarding\nparagraph (b)(1) of this section shall be submitted by joint petition of the\nfranchising authority and the cable television franchisee. Any such petition\nmay seek permission to substitute a commitment not required by this Part in\nlieu of one or more standards that are required. (g) Severability. If any provision of this\nsection or the application of such provision is held invalid by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction, the remainder of this section or the application of the\nprovision to other circumstances shall not be affected thereby. [FN1] If a single public access channel is shared by two or\nmore municipalities, the joint designation of a single entity is\nencouraged. [FN2] Where an educational or a governmental channel is\nshared by more than one school district or local government or combination\nthereof, administration of such channel(s) on a cooperative basis is\nencouraged.
