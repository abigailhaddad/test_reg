  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 277.5 - Replacement housing payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Replacement housing payments for 180-day homeowner-occupants. (1)\n\nEligibility. A displaced person is\neligible for the replacement housing payment for a 180-day homeowner-occupant\nif the person: (i) has actually owned and\noccupied the displacement dwelling for not less than 180 days immediately prior\nto the initiation of negotiations; and\n(ii)\npurchases and occupies a decent, safe\nand sanitary replacement dwelling within one year after the later of the\nfollowing dates (except that the agency may extend such one year period for\ngood cause): (a) the date the person receives\nfinal payment for the displacement dwelling or the date the required amount is\ndeposited; or\n(b) the date the\nagency identifies for the displacee replacement housing actually available\nwithin the limits of the offer extended for replacement housing. (2)\n\nAmount of payment\n\nThe replacement housing payment for an eligible 180- day homeowner-occupant may\nnot exceed $22,500. (See also section\n277.5\n[d]\n). The\npayment under this section is limited to the amount necessary to relocate to a\ncomparable replacement dwelling within one year from the date the displaced\nhomeowner-occupant is paid for the displacement dwelling, or the date such\nperson is initially offered a comparable replacement dwelling, whichever is\nlater. The payment shall be the sum of: (i) the amount by which the cost of a replacement dwelling exceeds the acquisition\ncost of the displacement dwelling as determined in accordance with paragraph\n(3) of this subdivision; (ii)\nthe\nincreased interest costs and other debt service costs which are incurred in\nconnection with the mortgage(s) on the replacement dwelling as determined in\naccordance with paragraph (4) of this subdivision; and\n(iii)\nthe reasonable expenses incidental to\nthe purchase of the replacement dwelling as determined in accordance with\nparagraph (5) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nPrice differential. (i) Basic computation. The price differential\nto be paid under subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph is the amount which must\nbe added to the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling to provide a\ntotal amount equal to the lesser of: (a) the\nreasonable cost of a comparable replacement dwelling as determined in\naccordance with section\n277.5\n(c)(1); or\n(b) the purchase price of the\ndecent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling actually purchased and occupied\nby the displaced person. (ii)\n\nMixed-use and multi-family properties. If the displacement dwelling was part of a property that contained another\ndwelling unit and/or space used for nonresidential purposes, and/or is located\non a lot larger than typical for residential purposes, only that portion of the\nacquisition payment which is actually attributable to the displacement dwelling\nshall be considered its acquisition cost when computing the price\ndifferential. (iii)\n\nInsurance\nproceeds. To the extent necessary to avoid duplicate compensation, the amount\nof any insurance proceeds received by a person in connection with a loss to the\ndisplacement dwelling due to a catastrophic occurrence (fire, flood, etc.)\nshall be included in the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling when\ncomputing the price differential. (iv)\n\nOwner retention of displacement\ndwelling. If the owner retains ownership of the displacement dwelling, moves it\nfrom the displacement site and reoccupies it on a replacement site, the\npurchase price of the replacement dwelling shall be the sum of: (a) the cost of moving and restoring the\ndwelling to a condition comparable to that prior to the move; and\n(b) the cost of making the unit a decent, safe, and sanitary replacement dwelling; and\n(c) the current fair market value for\nresidential use of the replacement site, unless the claimant rented the\ndisplacement site and there is a reasonable opportunity for the claimant to\nrent a suitable replacement site; and\n(d) the retention value of the dwelling, if\nsuch retention value is reflected in the \"acquisition cost\" used when computing\nthe replacement housing payment. (4)\n\nIncreased mortgage interest costs. The\npayment shall be an amount which will reduce the mortgage balance on the\nreplacement dwelling to an amount which would be amortized with the same\nmonthly payment for principal and interest as that for the mortgage(s) on the\ndisplacement dwelling. In addition, payments shall include other debt service\ncosts, if not paid as incidental costs, and shall be based only on bona fide\nmortgages that were valid liens on the displacement dwelling for at least 180\ndays prior to the initiation of negotiations. Subparagraphs (i)-(v) of this\nparagraph shall apply to the computation of the increased mortgage interest\ncosts payment, which payment shall be contingent upon a mortgage being placed\non the replacement dwelling. (i) The payment\nshall be based on the unpaid mortgage balances on the displacement dwelling; however, in the event the person obtains a smaller mortgage than the mortgage\nbalance(s) computed in the buydown determination, the amount computed as the\nbuydown payment must be adjusted to reflect the change. This can be done\nthrough proration by dividing the amount of the actual replacement mortgage by\nthe computed eligible replacement mortgage amount. This calculation provides a\npercentage factor which can be applied to the computed buydown amount resulting\nin an adjusted increased mortgage interest payment. In the case of a home\nequity loan the unpaid balance shall be that balance which existed 180 days\nprior to the initiation of negotiations or the balance on the date of\nacquisition, whichever is less. (ii)\n\nThe payment shall be based on the\nremaining term of the mortgage(s) on the displacement dwelling or the term of\nthe new mortgage, whichever is shorter. (iii)\n\nThe interest rate on the new mortgage\nused in determining the amount of the payment shall not exceed the prevailing\nfixed interest rate for conventional mortgages currently charged by mortgage\nlending institutions in the area in which the replacement dwelling is\nlocated. (iv)\n\nPurchaser's points\nand loan origination or assumption fees, but not seller's points, shall be paid\nto the extent: (a) they are not paid as\nincidental expenses; (b) they do\nnot exceed rates normal to similar real estate transactions in the\narea; (c) the agency determines\nthem to be necessary; and\n(d) the\ncomputation of such points and fees shall be based on the unpaid mortgage\nbalance on the displacement dwelling, less the amount determined for the\nreduction of such mortgage balance under this paragraph. (5)\n\nIncidental expenses. The\nincidental expenses to be paid under subparagraph (2)(iii) of this subdivision\nor section\n277.5\n(b)(3)(i)\nare\nthose necessary and reasonable costs actually incurred by the displaced person\nincident to the purchase of a replacement dwelling and customarily paid by the\nbuyer, including: (i) legal, closing and\nrelated costs, including those for title search, preparing conveyance\ninstruments, notary fees, preparing surveys and plats and recording\nfees; (ii)\nlender, FHA or VA\napplication and appraisal fees; (iii)\nloan origination or assumption fees\nthat do not represent prepaid interest; (iv)\ncertification of structural soundness\nand termite inspection when required; (v) credit report; (vi)\nowner's and mortgagee's evidence of\ntitle, e.g., title insurance, not to exceed the costs for a comparable\nreplacement dwelling; (vii)\nescrow\nagent's fee; (viii)\n\nState revenue\nor documentary stamps, sales or transfer taxes (not to exceed the costs for a\ncomparable replacement dwelling); (ix)\nsuch other costs as the agency\ndetermines to be incidental to the purchase. (6)\n\nRental assistance payment for 180-day\nhomeowner. A 180-day homeowner-occupant, who could be eligible for a\nreplacement housing payment under paragraph (1) of this subdivision but elects\nto rent a replacement dwelling, is eligible for a rental assistance payment not\nto exceed $5,250, computed and disbursed in accordance with subdivision (b) of\nthis section. (b) Replacement housing payment for 90-day occupants. (1)\n\nEligibility. A tenant or owner-occupant\ndisplaced from a dwelling is entitled to a payment not to exceed $5,250 for\nrental assistance, as computed in accordance with paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, or downpayment assistance, as computed in accordance with\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision, if such displaced person: (i) has actually and lawfully occupied the\ndisplacement dwelling for at least 90 days immediately prior to the initiation\nof negotiations; and\n(ii)\nhas\nrented, or purchased, and occupied a decent, safe and sanitary replacement\ndwelling within one year (unless the agency extends this period for good cause)\nafter: (a) for a tenant, the date the person\nmoved from the displacement dwelling; or\n(b) for an owner-occupant, the later of: (1)\nthe date the person receives final\npayment for the displacement dwelling; or\n(2)\nthe date the person moves from the\ndisplacement dwelling. (2)\n\nRental assistance payment. (i) Amount of payment. An eligible displaced\nperson who rents a replacement dwelling is entitled to a payment not to exceed\n$5,250 for rental assistance. (See also section\n277.5\n[d].) Such\npayment shall be 42 times the amount obtained by subtracting the base monthly\nrental for the displacement dwelling from the lesser of: (a) the monthly rent and estimated average\nmonthly cost of utilities for a comparable replacement dwelling; or\n(b) the monthly rent and estimated average\nmonthly cost of utilities for the decent, safe and sanitary replacement\ndwelling actually occupied by the displaced person. (ii)\n\nBase monthly rental for displacement\ndwelling. The base monthly rental for the displacement dwelling is the lesser\nof: (a) the average monthly cost for rent and\nutilities at the displacement dwelling for a reasonable period prior to\ndisplacement, as determined by the agency. (For an owner- occupant, use the\nfair market rent for the displacement dwelling. For a tenant who paid little or\nno rent for the displacement dwelling, use the fair market rent, unless its use\nwould result in a hardship because of the person's income or other\ncircumstances); (b) thirty (30)\npercent of the person's average gross household income. (If the person refuses\nto provide appropriate evidence of income or is a dependent, the base monthly\nrental shall be established solely on the criteria in clause (2)(ii)(a) of this\nsubdivision. A full time student or resident of an institution may be assumed\nto be a dependent, unless the person demonstrates otherwise); (c) the total of the amounts designated for\nshelter and utilities if receiving a welfare assistance payment from a program\nthat designates the amounts for shelter and utilities. (iii)\n\nManner of disbursement. A rental\nassistance payment may, at the agency's discretion, be disbursed in either a\nlump sum or in installments. However, except as limited by paragraph (c)(6) of\nthis section, the full amount vests immediately, whether or not there is any\nlater change in the person's income or rent, or in the condition or location of\nthe person's housing. (3)\n\nDownpayment assistance payment. (i) Amount of payment. An eligible displaced\nperson who purchases a replacement dwelling is entitled to a downpayment\nassistance payment in the amount the person would receive under paragraph (2)\nof this section if the person rented a comparable replacement dwelling. However, the payment to a displaced homeowner shall not exceed the amount the\nowner would receive under section\n277.5\n(a)(2)\nif the\n180-day occupancy requirement was met. A displaced person eligible to receive a\npayment as a 180-day owner-occupant under section\n277.5\n(a)(1)\nis not\neligible for this payment. (ii)\n\nApplication of payment. The full amount of the replacement housing payment for\ndownpayment assistance must be applied to the purchase price of the replacement\ndwelling and related incidental expenses. (c) Additional rules governing replacement\nhousing payments. (1)\n\nDetermining cost of\ncomparable replacement dwellings. The upper limit of a replacement housing\npayment shall be based on the cost of a comparable replacement dwelling. (i) If available, at least three comparable\nreplacement dwellings shall be examined and the payment computed on the basis\nof the dwelling most nearly representative of, and equal to, or better than, the displacement dwelling. An adjustment shall be made to the asking price of\nany dwelling, to the extent justified by local market data. An obviously\noverpriced dwelling may be ignored. (ii)\n\nIf the site of the comparable\nreplacement dwelling lacks a major exterior attribute of the displacement\ndwelling site, (e.g., the site is significantly smaller or does not contain a\nswimming pool), the value of such attribute shall be subtracted from the\nacquisition cost of the displacement dwelling for purposes of computing the\npayment. (iii)\n\nIf the acquisition\nof a portion of a typical residential property causes the displacement of the\nowner from the dwelling and the remainder is a buildable residential lot, the\nagency may offer to purchase the entire property. If the owner refuses said\noffer to sell the remainder, the fair market value of the remainder may be\nadded to the acquisition cost of the displacement dwelling for purposes of\ncomputing the replacement housing payment. (iv)\n\nTo the extent feasible, comparable\nreplacement dwellings shall be selected from the neighborhood in which the\ndisplacement dwelling was located or, if that is not possible, in nearby or\nsimilar neighborhoods where housing costs are generally the same or\nhigher. (2)\n\nInspection\nof replacement dwelling. Before making a replacement housing payment or\nreleasing a payment from escrow, the agency or its designated representative\nshall inspect the replacement dwelling and determine whether it is a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling. (3)\n\nPurchase of replacement dwelling. A displaced person is considered to have met\nthe requirement to purchase a replacement dwelling, if the person: (i) purchases a dwelling; or\n(ii)\npurchases and rehabilitates a\nsubstandard dwelling; or\n(iii)\nrelocates a dwelling which the person owns or purchases; or\n(iv)\nconstructs a dwelling on a site the\nperson owns or purchases; or\n(v) contracts for the purchase or construction of a dwelling on a site provided by\na builder or on a site the person owns or purchases; or\n(vi)\ncurrently owns a previously purchased\ndwelling and site, valuation of which shall be on the basis of current fair\nmarket value. (4)\n\nOccupancy requirements for displacement or replacement dwelling. No person\nshall be denied eligibility for a replacement housing payment solely because\nthe person is unable to meet the occupancy requirements set forth in these\nregulations for a reason beyond the person's control, including: (i) a disaster, an emergency, or an imminent\nthreat to the public health or welfare, as determined by the President, State\nor the agency; or\n(ii)\nanother\nreason, such as a delay in the construction of the replacement dwelling, military reserve duty, or hospital stay, as determined by the agency. (5)\n\nConversion of payment. A\ndisplaced person who initially rents a replacement dwelling and receives a\nrental assistance payment under section\n277.5\n(b)(2)\nis\neligible to receive a payment under section\n277.5\n(a) or\nsection\n277.5\n(b)(3)\nif the\nperson meets the eligibility criteria for such payments, including purchase and\noccupancy within the prescribed 1 year period. Any portion of the rental\nassistance payment that has been disbursed shall be deducted from the payment\ncomputed under section\n277.5\n(a) or\nsection\n277.5\n(b)(3). (6)\n\nPayment after death. A replacement\nhousing payment is personal to the displaced person and on the person's death\nthe undisbursed portion of any such payment shall not be paid to the heirs or\nassigns, except that: (i) The amount\nattributable to the displaced person's period of actual occupancy of the\nreplacement housing shall be paid. (ii)\n\nThe full payment shall be disbursed in\nany case in which a member of a displaced family dies and the other family\nmembers continue to occupy a decent, safe and sanitary replacement\ndwelling. (iii)\n\nAny portion of a\nreplacement housing payment necessary to satisfy the legal obligations of an\nestate in connection with the selection of a replacement dwelling by or on\nbehalf of a deceased person shall be disbursed to the estate. (d) Replacement housing\nof last resort. (1)\n\nDetermination to provide\nreplacement housing of last resort. Whenever a program or project cannot\nproceed on a timely basis because comparable replacement dwellings are not\navailable within the monetary limits for owners or tenants as specified in\nsection\n277.5\n(a) or\nsection\n277.5\n(b), as\nappropriate, the agency shall provide additional or alternate assistance under\nthe provisions of this subdivision. Any decision to provide last resort housing\nassistance must be adequately justified either: (i) On a case-by-case basis, for good cause, which means that appropriate consideration has been given to: (a) the availability of comparable housing in\nthe project or program area; and\n(b) the resources available to provide\ncomparable housing; and\n(c) the\nindividual circumstances of the displaced person; or\n(ii)\n\nBy a determination that: (a) there is little, if any, comparable\nreplacement housing available to displaced persons within an entire project or\nprogram area and, therefore, last resort housing assistance is necessary for\nthe area as a whole; and\n(b) a\nproject or program cannot be advanced to completion in a timely manner without\nlast resort housing assistance; and\n(c) the method selected for providing last\nresort housing assistance is cost-effective, considering all elements which\ncontribute to total project or program costs. (2)\n\nBasic rights of persons to be displaced. Notwithstanding any provision of this subdivision, no person shall be required\nto move from a displacement dwelling unless comparable replacement housing is\navailable to such person. No person may be deprived of any rights provided\nunder this Part. The agency shall not require any displaced person to accept a\ndwelling provided by the agency under this Part (unless the agency and the\ndisplaced person have entered into a contract to do so) in lieu of any\nacquisition payment or any relocation payment for which the person may\notherwise be eligible. (3)\n\nMethods\nof providing comparable replacement housing. The agency shall have broad\nlatitude in implementing this section, but implementation shall be for\nreasonable cost, on a case-by-case basis unless an exception to case-by-case\nanalysis is justified for an entire project. (i) The methods of providing housing of last\nresort include, but are not limited to: (a) a\nreplacement housing payment in excess of the limits set forth in section\n277.5\n(a) or\nsection\n277.5\n(b). A rental\nassistance subsidy under this section may be provided in installments or in a\nlump sum at the agency's discretion; (b) rehabilitation of and/or additions to an\nexisting replacement dwelling; (c) the construction of a new replacement dwelling; (d) the relocation and, if necessary, rehabilitation of a dwelling; (e) the purchase of land and/or a replacement dwelling by the agency and subsequent\nsale or lease to or exchange with a displaced person; (f) the removal of barriers to the\nhandicapped; and\n(g) the change in\nstatus of the displaced person, with the person's concurrence, from tenant to\nhomeowner when it is more cost-effective to do so, as in cases where a\ndownpayment may be less expensive than a last resort rental assistance\npayment. (ii)\n\nUnder\nspecial circumstances, consistent with the definition of a comparable\nreplacement dwelling, modified methods of providing housing of last resort\npermit consideration of replacement housing based on space and physical\ncharacteristics different from those in the displacement dwelling, including\nupgraded, but smaller replacement housing that is decent, safe and sanitary and\nadequate to accommodate individuals or families displaced from marginal or\nsubstandard housing with probable functional obsolescence. In no event, however, shall a displaced person be required to move into a dwelling that is\nnot functionally equivalent to the displacement dwelling. (iii)\n\nThe agency shall provide assistance\nunder this subdivision to a displaced person who is not eligible to receive a\nreplacement housing payment under section\n277.5\n(a) or\nsection\n277.5\n(b) because\nof failure to meet the length-of-occupancy requirement when comparable\nreplacement rental housing is not available at rental rates within the person's\nfinancial means, which is 30 percent of the person's gross monthly household\nincome. Such assistance shall cover a period of 42 months. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n277.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
