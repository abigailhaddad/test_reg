(e) Application of tolerances. The\ncontents of individual packages in the lot, based on sample inspection, are\nsubject to the following limitations: (1)\n\nPackages may contain not more than double any specified tolerance except that\nat least two defective and two off-size specimens may be permitted in any\npackage: provided, that the averages for the entire lot are within the\ntolerances specified for the grade.
