Such request shall identify the record constituting a\ntrade secret and the reasons why disclosure of such record would cause\nsubstantial injury. The request shall indicate, if appropriate: (1)\nthe specific record requested to be\nconsidered a trade secret, including, where applicable, page, form, line, chart, or table designation; (2)\nthe confidential nature of the record, including a description of the nature\nand extent of the injury to the person's competitive position such as unfair\neconomic or competitive damage which would be incurred were the record to be\ndisclosed; (3)\nwhether the record\nis treated as confidential by the submitter, including whether it has been made\navailable to others; (4)\nwhether\nany patent, copyright, or similar legal protection exists for the\nrecord; (5)\nwhether the public\ndisclosure of such record is otherwise restricted by law, and the specific\nsource and contents of such restrictions; (6)\nthe date upon which such record will no\nlonger need to be kept confidential, if applicable; (7)\nwhether the request itself constitutes a\nrecord which, if disclosed, would defeat the purpose for which trade secret\nstatus is sought; (8)\nwhether the\nrecord is known outside of the business of the submitter; (9)\nthe extent to which the record is known\nby the employees and others involved in the business of the\nsubmitter; (10)\nthe value of the\nrecord to the submitter and to its competitors; (11)\nthe amount of effort or money expended\nby the submitter in developing the record; (12)\nthe ease or difficulty with which the\nrecord could be properly acquired or duplicated by others; and\n(13)\nany other factors considered\nrelevant.
