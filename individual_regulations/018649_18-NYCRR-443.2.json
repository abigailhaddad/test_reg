If an\napplicant discloses in the sworn statement that he/she or any other person over\nthe age of 18 currently residing in the home has been convicted of a crime, the\nagency must determine, in accordance with guidelines developed and disseminated\nby the Office of Children and Family Services to the extent consistent with\nsection\n443.8\nof this Part, whether to\napprove such applicant. If the agency determines that it will approve the\napplicant to receive a foster care placement, the agency must maintain a\nwritten record, as part of the application and home study file of such\napplicant, of the reason(s) why the applicant was determined to be appropriate\nand acceptable to be certified or approved as a foster parent; and\n(v) completed fingerprint cards for the\napplicant(s) and each person over the age of 18 currently residing in the home\nof such applicant(s). The authorized agency must promptly submit such\nfingerprint cards to the Office of Children and Family Services for forwarding\nto the Division of Criminal Justice Services to perform a criminal history\nrecord check by the Division of Criminal Justice Services and the Federal\n\nBureau of Investigation. The authorized agency must use the information\nobtained through the criminal history record check(s) in accordance with\nsection\n443.8\nof this Part; (14)\nacknowledge, within 10 days\nof receipt of a completed application, receipt of such form and either reject\nthe applicant for home study or accept the applicant for home study.

A person whose\napplication is not accepted must be advised in writing of the reason(s) for\nrejection; (16)\nrequire that a\nmedical report form must be filed with the agency either prior to or after\nacceptance for a home study. The completion of the home study required by this\n\nPart must be conditioned upon the submission of an acceptable medical report\nform. The medical report form must cover a physical examination of the\napplicant(s) conducted not more than one year preceding the date that the\napplication is submitted to an authorized agency that was conducted by a\nphysician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner or other licensed and\nqualified health care practitioner, as appropriate, regarding the members of\nthe foster family's general health, that indicates the absence of communicable\ndisease, infection or illness or any physical or mental conditions which might\naffect the proper care of a foster child, or that presence of any identified\naffliction does not pose a risk to the health and safety of children. (17)\nif the applicant and the applicant's\nfamily have previously completed a medical exam for an adoption study, that\nmedical report will satisfy the requirement of paragraph (16) of this\nsubdivision if the report has been completed within the past year; (18)\nunless an application has been rejected\nprior to submission of the medical report form in accordance with paragraph\n(16) of this subdivision, within 15 days of receipt of a medical report form an\nagency must acknowledge receipt of such form and must either accept or reject\nthe applicant for a home study. A person whose application is not accepted\nbased on an unacceptable medical report must be advised in writing of the\nreasons for such rejection; (19)\ntreat all reopenings of foster homes that have closed as requests for a new\ncertificate or approval. A new application must be completed regardless of how\nlong the home has been closed.

(20)\n\nIn addition to the\nrequirements set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision, the\nauthorized agency to which the person has applied for certification or approval\nas a foster parent must review information available in the CONNECTIONS system\nto determine whether such person previously held a certificate or letter of\napproval as a foster parent and, if so, whether such certificate or letter of\napproval was revoked, not renewed, or a foster child was removed from the\napplicant's home for health and safety reasons and must consider such\ninformation in determining whether a certificate or letter of approval should\nbe issued to such applicant. All such inquiries must be completed and evaluated\nbefore the authorized agency may issue a certificate or letter of approval to\nthe applicant. (c) Home study. Authorized agencies must complete a home study within\nfour months after acceptance of an application unless delays occur as a result\nof circumstances beyond the control of the agency or unless the schedule for\ninterviews with the applicant is changed by mutual consent of the applicant and\nthe agency representative. (1)\nA home\nstudy and evaluation of the members of the foster family household or the\nrelative's family household must determine compliance with all of the following\ncriteria for certification or approval: (i) Age. Each foster parent must be over the age of 21. (ii)\n\nHealth. Each member of the household of\nthe foster family must be in good physical and mental health and free from\ncommunicable diseases. However, physical handicaps or illness of foster parents\nor members of their household must be a consideration only as they affect the\nability to provide adequate care to foster children or may affect an individual\nchild's adjustment to the foster family. Cases must be evaluated on an\nindividual basis with assistance of a medical consultant when indicated. A\nwritten report from a physician, physician assistant, nurse practitioner or\nother licensed and qualified health care practitioner as appropriate, on the\nhealth of a family, including a complete physical examination of the applicant, must be filed with the agency initially and biennially thereafter. Additional\nmedical reports must be furnished upon the request of either the agency worker\nor the foster parent. Such reports must conform to the standards set forth in\nthis Part. (iii)\n\nEmployment. Employment of a foster parent outside the home must be permitted when there are\nsuitable plans for the care and supervision of the child at all times, including after school and during the summer. Such plans must be made part of\nthe foster family record and must receive prior agency approval, unless only\none of the two foster parents is working outside the home. (iv)\n\nMarital status. The marital status of an\napplicant may be a factor in determining whether or not a certification or\napproval will be granted only as it affects the ability to provide adequate\ncare to foster children. Changes in marital status of certificate and letter of\napproval holders must be reported to the authorized agency and existing\ncertificates or letters of approval may be revoked and new certificates or\nletters of approval issued consistent with the best interests of the\nchild. (v) Character. Each\napplicant for certification or approval must be required to provide the agency\nwith the names of three persons who may be contacted for references. The agency\nmust seek signed statements from these persons attesting to the applicant's\nmoral character, mature judgment, ability to manage financial resources and\ncapacity for developing a meaningful relationship with children, or utilize\nin-person interviews attesting to the same. (vi)\n\nAbility and motivation. The agency must\nexplore each applicant's understanding of the role of a foster parent and the\napplicant's ability, motivation and psychological readiness to be a foster\nparent in accordance with guidelines issued by the office. The agency also must\nexplore the understanding of the other members of the household about foster\ncare and their concept of a foster child's role in the family. (2)\n\nAuthorized agencies must\nadvise applicants at the outset of the home study process that the agency\ndecision to either certify or approve or not to certify or approve them for\nfoster family care will be presented in writing, and that applicants who are\nrejected will be offered a personal interview in accordance with the provisions\nof this Part. (3)\n\nWhen an\nauthorized agency decides to discontinue a home study or to deny certification\nor approval upon completion of the home study, it must advise the applicant in\nwriting of the reasons for the agency's decision and must offer an interview to\ndiscuss the decision. (4)\nA plan to\ndiscontinue a home study or to deny certification or approval for foster family\ncare must be reviewed and approved by one or more supervisory level personnel\nunless the home study was discontinued at the request of the\napplicant. (5)\n\nWhen an agency\ndenies an application for certification or approval on the basis, in whole or\nin part, that the Office of Children and Family Services has notified the\nagency that the applicant is the subject of an indicated report of child abuse\nor maltreatment on file with the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and\n\nMaltreatment, the applicant may request a hearing in accordance with the\nprovisions of this section and section\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law. (6)\n\nAn\napplication for certification or approval that has been pending for six months\ndue to failure of the applicant to provide information requested or to\ncooperate with the approval or certification process will be considered\nexpired. This expiration will require a new application for those prospective\nfoster parents who still seek certification or approval.
