(1)\n\nOnly locations approved by the permit-issuing official as part of the camp's safety plan can be used for swimming. (2)\n\nAdequate light must be present to effectively supervise swimming activities. Swimming shall be prohibited between sunset and sunrise at wilderness swimming sites. Lighting for indoor and nighttime swimming pool use must comply with Subpart 6-1 of this Title. (3)\n\nSwimming pools and bathing beaches operated as part of a children's camp shall comply with Part 6 of this Title, and the following: (i) The swimming pool or bathing beach shall be directly supervised by a camp aquatics director.

Non-swimmers shall be confined to the area appropriate to their assessed swimming ability. Non-swimmers shall be conspicuously identified to be readily distinguishable from swimmers except where non-swimmers are restricted from entering the swimmer area by a physical barrier such as a swim crib or dock, or are in a separate pool only for non-swimmers. Non-swimmers shall be restricted to water less than chest deep, except: (a) during learn-to-swim programs that use a supervision protocol determined by the State Commissioner of Health to protect a camper from injury or drowning; or\n(b) when counselors are in the water and directly supervise a maximum of three non-swimmers in shallow water in the non-swimmer area. (iii)\n\nPermanent swimming areas shall have supervised entrances and exits, lifeguard station providing an unobstructed view of the swimming area, and lifesaving equipment. Swimming pools shall be protected by fences: entrance gates shall be locked except during periods when a lifeguard is on duty. (iv)\nA buddy system and board system of supervising and checking bathers must be described in the camp's approved safety plan and implemented. It must include, as a minimum: (a) an accounting system which identifies each bather by name, the bather's swimming ability and the swim area to which the bather is assigned; (b) a method of recording the entry to and exit from the swim area for each bather; (c) the assignment of each bather to a buddy who must have the same level of swimming ability.

When children are unable to comprehend or implement the buddy system, another method which the permit-issuing official has determined provides an equivalent level of bather safety, supervision and accountability for these children may be substituted for the buddy system and board system. The method must be described in the camp's approved safety plan. A \"lost swimmer\" plan, which details all procedures to be followed, including clearing the water, searching and supervising campers present, is required and must be included in the camp's approved safety plan.
