WHEREAS, this winter storm is anticipated to produce snowfall\namounts of up to 24 inches, at a rate of up to three inches per hour, wind\ngusts as high as 60mph, and coastal flooding in low lying areas. These\nconditions are anticipated to cause widespread power outages and road closures, travel disruptions, and damage to public and private property throughout the\nimpacted areas and will pose a threat to the public health and safety. NOW, THEREFORE, I, ANDREW M. CUOMO, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution of the\n\nState of New York and Section 28 of Article 2-B of the Executive Law, do hereby\nfind that a disaster is imminent for which the affected local governments are\nunable to respond adequately.
