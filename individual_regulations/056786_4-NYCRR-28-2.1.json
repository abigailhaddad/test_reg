  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 §§ 28-2.1 - Sick leave\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Effective\n\nJanuary 1, 1986, this section shall apply to all appointees not subject to the\nprovisions of section\n28-1.3\nof this Part. (b) Sick leave is absence with pay\nnecessitated by the illness or disability of the employee, including illness or\ndisability caused by pregnancy or childbirth. (c) Employees who are on the payroll on the\ndate on which sick leave credits are otherwise to be granted shall be entitled\nto eight days of sick leave credits for each 12 months of service up to a total\nof 200 days. Effective January 1, 2000, up to 200 days of such credits may be\nused to pay for health insurance in retirement in accordance with section\n167\n(4)\nof the Civil Service Law. Such sick leave\nshall be credited as follows: (1)\n\nFour days\nof sick leave credits upon completion of six months of State service and four\ndays of such credits following completion of each six additional months of\n\nState service; provided, however, that any eligible employee electing to\nparticipate in the Income Protection Plan pursuant to Part 78 of this Title\n(President's Regulations) shall immediately receive four days of such sick\nleave credit on the effective date of such election. (2)\n\nPart-time employees shall be granted sick\nleave credits not to exceed four days following completion of each six months\nof State service which credits shall be prorated based on the percentage of\nfull-time service such employee is scheduled to work on each sick leave grant\ndate. (3)\n\nEmployees who are not in\npay status on a date on which such sick leave would otherwise be credited, shall be entitled to receive such sick leave credit on the date they return to\npay status and the date on which such sick leave credits are to be thereafter\ncredited shall be revised accordingly. (d) An employee absent on sick leave shall\nnotify the appropriate supervisor of such absence and the reason therefor on\nthe first day of such absence and within two hours after the beginning of the\nemployee's workday; provided, however, that where the work is such that a\nsubstitute may be required, the appointing authority may require earlier\nnotification, but not more than two hours prior to the beginning of the\nemployee's workday. Sick leave credits may be used in such units as the\nappointing authority may approve, but the appointing authority shall not\nrequire that sick leave credits be used in units greater than one-quarter\nhour. (e) Before absence for\npersonal illness may be charged against accumulated sick leave credits, the\nappointing authority may require such proof of illness as may be satisfactory\nto it, or may require the employee to be examined, at the expense of the\ndepartment or agency, by a physician designated by the appointing authority. In\nthe event of failure to submit proof of illness upon request, or in the event\nthat, upon such proof as is submitted or upon the report of medical\nexamination, the appointing authority finds that there is not satisfactory\nevidence of illness sufficient to justify the employee's absence from the\nperformance of his/her duties, such absence may be considered as unauthorized\nleave and shall not be charged against accumulated sick leave credits. Abuse of\nsick leave privileges shall be cause for disciplinary action. (f) The appointing authority may require an\nemployee who has been absent because of personal illness, prior to and as a\ncondition of return to duty, to be examined, at the expense of the department\nor agency, by a physician designated by the appointing authority, to establish\nthat such employee is not disabled from the performance of his/her normal\nduties and that the return to duty will not jeopardize the health of other\nemployees. (g) In addition to\npersonal illness of the employee, the following types of absence when approved\nby the appointing authority, may be charged against accumulated sick leave\ncredits: illness or death in the employee's family, provided, however, that\ncharge for such absence shall not exceed a maximum of 15 days in any one year; absence of an employee certified by an examining physician as benefiting from\nthe use of a service animal in performing major life activities, or who is\nregistered with the New York State Commission for the Blind and Visually\n\nHandicapped as legally blind, or certified by an examining physician or\nlicensed optometrist as legally blind, as manifested by visual acuity of 20/200\nor less in the better eye with best correction or a visual field of 20 degrees\nor less, or who has a hearing impairment manifested by a speech discrimination\nscore of 40 percent or less in the better ear with appropriate correction as\ncertified by an examining physician or by a licensed audiologist or\notorhinolaryngologist, for the purpose of obtaining a guide dog or service\nanimal and required training related thereto; provided, however, that charge\nfor such absence shall not exceed a maximum of 26 days in any one calendar\nyear; and personal visits to a doctor or dentist. Proof of the need for such\nabsence, satisfactory to the appointing authority, may be required. (h) When an employee is transferred, such\nemployee's accumulated sick leave credits shall also be transferred. When an\nemployee is separated from service for other than disciplinary reasons and is\nsubsequently reinstated or reemployed within one year after such separation, or\nis reinstated by action of the State Civil Service Commission, or is reinstated\nor reemployed while eligible for reinstatement from a preferred list, sick\nleave credits accumulated and unused at the time of separation shall be\nrestored; provided, however, that such sick leave credits shall not be restored\nexcept where leave records satisfactory to the appointing authority and the\n\nDepartment of Civil Service are available. (i) Every per diem and hourly paid employee\nemployed on a full-time basis appointed on or after January 1, 1986, with no\ncreditable State service prior to such date as defined in section\n28-1.3\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Part shall, on the date such employee becomes subject to these rules, be\ngranted four days of sick leave credits and that date shall become one of the\nemployee's sick leave grant dates; provided, however, a per diem or hourly paid\nemployee initially appointed on or after January 1, 1986, who is given\nanticipated eligibility shall be granted sick leave in accordance with\nsubdivision (c) of this section.
