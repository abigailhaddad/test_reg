(b) Actions\npursuant to subdivision (a) of this section may be without prejudice to the\nrecommencement of the revocation case or issuance of a new notice of violation\nand/or warrant based upon the same charges, as the Board member\ndirects. (c) Following a waiver by\nthe releasee of a preliminary parole revocation hearing or a finding of a\npreponderance of the evidence at a preliminary hearing, upon application of the\n\nDepartment submitted to the Board and prior to any appearance at a final\nhearing, upon agreement of three Board members, the notice of violation or\nwarrant may be vacated with the releasee restored to supervision under such\ncircumstances as are deemed appropriate. (d) Where a final revocation hearing has not\nyet commenced by the swearing of witnesses and the taking of testimony or\nevidence, the revocation case, notice of violation, and delinquency, if any, may be cancelled by three members of the Board of Parole or the administrative\nlaw judge, who shall state their reasons in writing for the cancellation at or\nbefore the time of the final hearing but prior to the swearing of witnesses and\nthe taking of testimony or evidence. In cases where the alleged violator is\nserving a sentence for a felony offense under articles 120, 125, 130, 135, 160, 230, 235, 255, 263, 265, 485 or 490 of the Penal Law, or where the releasee has\nbeen granted early conditional parole for deportation only or conditional\nparole for deportation only pursuant to section\n259-i (2)\n(d) of the Executive Law, such cancellation\ncan only be effectuated by the three members of the Board. Cancellation under\nthis subdivision shall not preclude a subsequent notice of violation or warrant\nbased on the same charges. (e) Where a final revocation hearing has commenced by the swearing of witnesses and\nthe taking of testimony or evidence, a revocation case may no longer be\ncancelled except following dismissal of all violation charges at the conclusion\nof a final revocation hearing. A cancellation under this subdivision shall\npreclude a subsequent notice of violation or warrant based upon the same\nviolation charges. (f) A warrant\nmay be withdrawn or cancelled without a cancellation of the revocation\ncase. (g) Cancellation of the\nrevocation case pursuant to this section shall also cancel the delinquency that\nmay have been declared pursuant to subdivision (a) of section\n8004.10\nof this Part.
