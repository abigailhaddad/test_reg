  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 550.6 - Variances\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any person or\nother entity discharging effluents is relieved of the requirements for such\neffluents contained in section\n550.2\n(e)(3) and\n(4)\nof this Part if at all times of the year\nthe waters into which the discharge enters meet the requirements of section\n550.2\n(c) of this\n\nPart. The foregoing applies only if the discharger who is discharging\nbiochemical oxygen demand or total suspended solids or both has a permit from\nthe United States Environmental Protection Agency or the State pursuant to\nsection 402 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act amendments of 1972\n(33 USC\n1342\n), which permit has requirements or\nlimitations relating to discharge of biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended\nsolids, or both, as the case may be, and the discharger is complying with those\nrequirements or limitations. (b) Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to encourage or give the\nsanction of the Interstate Environmental Commission to the degradation of any\nwaters which are of a quality consistent with these regulations. Accordingly, it is the responsibility of any discharger determining that he will proceed\nunder these variance provisions to plan and operate his facilities and\nprocesses with due regard for present and changing conditions of, and affecting\nthe waters in, his area. It shall not be a defense to a violation that the\ndischarger did not anticipate or was not aware of changes which have resulted\nin the applicability of section\n550.2\n(e)(3) and\n(4)\nof this Part, to his effluent\ndischarge. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n550.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
