  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 891.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In Table I an item number is assigned consecutively to\neach specifically designated waters or portion thereof. (b) Waters index number, as\nappearing in Table I, shall mean that number or abbreviation assigned to any\ndesignated waters or portion thereof for the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering or index system used to\nidentify specific waters of New York State was adapted from that used by the\n\nNew York State Conservation Department in its biological survey series of\nreports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a drainage area, such\nas a river, large lake, bay or sound is usually referred to by name or an\nabbreviation. Tributaries of primary river waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Tributaries of primary lake, bay or sound\nwaters are consecutively numbered in a clockwise order from a defined point, usually the outlet of the primary waters. Subtributaries are numbered as\nencountered along the tributary proceeding from its mouth to the source, and in\nlike manner all of its other stream courses are so numbered. Ponds and lakes\nare numbered in the order they are encountered within the system. Tributaries\nof such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing\nclockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. The numbers\nassigned to such lakes and ponds are prefixed by the letter P. When isolated\nlakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for\nconvenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any waters to\nwhich no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the waters\nunder consideration by the New York State Conservation Department in its\n\nBiological Survey of the Fresh Waters of Long Island\nin 1938, and has been closely followed in connection with the numerical identification\nof the waters with the following exceptions: Some of the stream numbers do not\nrun consecutively due to the omission of streams originally shown on the older\nmaps employed by the Conservation Department at the time of its 1938 survey but\nnot shown on later editions of maps reproduced herein. Conversely, streams, lakes and ponds not shown on the older maps but appearing on the newer maps are\ndesignated by suffix letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of the designated waters may be outlined as follows: The index\nused to identify the designated waters is based on the system of numbering the\nfresh waters draining Long Island proper. The streams of Long Island have been\nconsecutively numbered starting at Fort Hamilton and proceeding in a clockwise\ndirection around the island, such numbers being prefixed by the abbreviation\nLI. However, certain bays and inlets have not been referenced by this numbering\nsystem, but are cited by name and description. (4)\n\nThe following table will illustrate how\nthe designated waters may be identified through the use of the waters index\nsystem: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\n\nNone assigned\n\nJamaica Bay Rockaway Inlet Gerritsen Inlet Dead\n\nHorse Bay\n\nWaters identified by name and description and not\nused to index tributaries. LI 249\n\nOld Mill Creek\n\nThe 249th stream encountered on Long Island\nproceeding in a clockwise direction around the island from Fort Hamilton. LI 249-2\n\nRalph Creek\n\nThe second tributary proceeding upstream from the\nmouth of Old Mill Creek. LI 241-1-P 1023\n\nGonselyeas Pond\n\nThe 1023rd pond or lake encountered in the Long\n\nIsland waters index system. The body of water is on the first tributary of LI\n241 (Hook Creek). (c) The abbreviations\ntrib. and\ntribs., indicating tributary and tributaries, shall mean\nany stream, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other\nstream, pond or other body of surface water; where no tributary or tributaries\nare mentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include only the\nstream, pond or other body of water referenced by such waters index number; where a tributary or tributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically designated waters shall include the stream, pond or other body\nof water referenced by such waters index number and all tributaries thereof, which are shown on the reference maps, excluding numbered ponds, unless\nexceptions as expressly stated. (d) Name, as appearing in Table I, shall mean the name by which\nthe specifically designated waters are known and which name may appear on the\nreference maps. In cases of specifically designated waters which have no name, the named waters to which the unnamed waters are tributary are identified as\nfar as possible. (e) Description. The column headed \"Description\" contains designations of\nsegments or sections of waters under consideration to which a particular\nassignment of a class and standards shall apply. Also included in this column\nis any useful information pertinent to the classification or standards. (f) Map Ref. No., as appearing in Table I, means map reference number and indicates one or more\nof the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely or in part in\nsection\n891.9, infra, on\nwhich maps the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown\nwithin the topographical limit line of the described drainage basins or areas. Index for map numbers is shown on Map 2, section\n891.8, infra. The\nfollowing maps were produced from original maps which may be procured through\nthe Washington Distribution Section, Geological Survey, Silver Spring, Maryland. Map Ref.
