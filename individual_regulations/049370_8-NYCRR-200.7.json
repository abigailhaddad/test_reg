If the parents disagree with the\nrecommendation of the committee on special education, they may request that the\nboard of education appoint an impartial hearing officer to review that\nrecommendation, and the hearing officer shall consider, together with all other\nrelevant information, the evaluation conducted by the State-supported school.

The decision of the hearing officer may be appealed in\naccordance with section\n4404\nof the\n\nEducation Law.

The decision of the impartial hearing officer may be\nappealed in accordance with section\n4404\nof the\n\nEducation Law.

Appointments\nfor severely physically disabled students to attend the Henry Viscardi School\nshall be on a day basis only. (v) The commissioner, or his or her designee, in determining whether to appoint the\nstudent to a State-operated school, shall consider whether the placement at the\n\nState- operated school is an appropriate placement in the least restrictive\nenvironment, taking into account any alternative placement recommended by the\nschool district responsible for the student. (3)\n\nIf the commissioner, or his or her\ndesignee, determines that placement in the State- operated school is not in the\nleast restrictive environment or otherwise disagrees with the recommendation of\nthe State-operated school, the commissioner shall state his or her reasons in\nwriting and shall send the recommendation back to the multidisciplinary team of\nthe State- operated school for reconsideration, with notice to the parents and\nthe school district responsible for the student.
