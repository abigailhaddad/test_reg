  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 157.2 - Application for automatic extension of time for filing New York State income tax returns\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ndepartment will grant an automatic extension of time to file a New York State\nincome tax return beyond the date prescribed for filing the return upon the\nproper application by the individual, partnership, or fiduciary required to\nfile the return. The length of time of the automatic extension for a New York\n\nState individual income tax return is six months. Except as to electing large\npartnerships allowed an automatic six-month extension for Federal purposes, which shall be allowed an automatic six-month extension for filing their New\n\nYork State partnership returns, the length of time of the automatic extension\nfor a New York State partnership or fiduciary return is five months. Consistent\nwith section\n657\nof the Tax Law, the automatic extension may be granted for a different length\nof time to conform to extensions for comparable Federal forms. The application\nfor an automatic extension must be filed on or before the date prescribed for\nfiling the appropriate return. (b) The department will set forth in the appropriate forms and instructions the\ndifferent methods, along with the terms and conditions for each, for\nindividuals, partnerships, and fiduciaries to make proper application for the\nautomatic extension of time to file a New York State income tax return. The\nmethods may include, but are not limited to, the use of the appropriate New\n\nYork State application form, the corresponding Federal application form, electronic filing, and the department's web site application process. (c) (1)\n\nIn\nthe case of an individual or a fiduciary, the application for automatic\nextension of time for filing a New York State income tax return must be\naccompanied by a full remittance of the amounts properly estimated as New York\n\nState personal income tax, City of New York tax, and City of Yonkers tax\nremaining unpaid as of the date prescribed for filing the return. For purposes\nof this Part, the New York State personal income tax means the amount of New\n\nYork State personal income tax imposed under article 22 of the Tax Law; the\n\nCity of New York tax means the City of New York personal income tax imposed\nunder chapter 17 of title 11 of the Administrative Code of the City of New\n\nYork; and the City of Yonkers taxmeans the City of Yonkers income tax surcharge\non residents imposed under article IX of the Codes and Ordinances of the City\nof Yonkers and the City of Yonkers earning tax on nonresidents imposed under\narticle X of the Codes and Ordinances of the City of Yonkers. (2)\n\nIn the case of an individual or a\nfiduciary, and notwithstanding any other provision of this Title, the\napplication for automatic extension of time for filing the income tax return\nmust be accompanied by a full remittance of any sales and compensating use\ntaxes remaining unpaid as of the date prescribed for filing the income tax\nreturn (see part R3 of chapter 62 of the Laws of 2003, as amended by part V of\nchapter 686 of the Laws of 2003). (d) Any automatic extension of time for\nfiling a New York State income tax return granted under this section will not\noperate to extend the time for the payment of any New York State personal\nincome tax, City of New York tax, City of Yonkers tax, or sales and\ncompensating use taxes due on the return. (However, see section\n157.5\nof this Part for extension of time for payment of New York State personal\nincome tax, City of New York tax, and City of Yonkers tax. Also, see section\n2392.1\nof this\n\nTitle for provisions relating to the presumption of reasonable cause for\npurposes of not imposing the late payment addition to tax.)\n(e) Except in undue hardship cases, the\ndepartment will not grant an extension of time to file a New York State income\ntax return unless the provisions for application set forth both in this section\nand in the appropriate forms and instructions have been met.
