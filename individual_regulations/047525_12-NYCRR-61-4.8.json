  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 61-4.8 - Standards of conduct for blasting operations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Handling, placing and detonating\nexplosives. (1)\n\nAll blasting operations shall\nbe performed under the supervision of a blaster-in-charge. (2)\n\nNo individuals other than the\nblaster-in-charge, certified blasters and other authorized blasting assistants\nshall be allowed in the blasting site after the loading of explosives has begun\nuntil such time as the all clear is given by the blaster-in-charge after the\ndetonation. (3)\n\nThe work of\nhandling and placing explosives in preparation for a blast shall be performed\nonly by: (i) the blaster-in-charge; or\n(ii)\na certified blaster acting\nwithin the scope of the classification for which they are certified; or\n(iii)\nauthorized blasting\nassistants under the direct supervision of the certified blaster or the\nblaster-in-charge. (4)\n\nThe detonation of explosives shall be under the control of the\nblaster-in-charge. The detonation of explosives may be performed by a\ndesignated authorized blasting assistant under the direction of the\nblaster-in-charge. (b) Charging. In charging holes for blasting, only non sparking material shall be\nused for tamping and loading. (c) Fuse requirements. Any fuse which varies more than 10 percent from an average\nspeed when burned unconfined in the open at sea level in three-foot lengths\nshall not be used. Any fuse that burns faster than 90 seconds per three-foot\nlength with more than an allowable variation of 10 percent, when burned\nunconfined in the open at sea level, shall not be used. Any 40 second/foot fuse\nlength less than 36 inches shall not be used. This shall not apply to\nlog-splitting wedges, the fuses for which may be not less than 12 inches in\nlength. Fuses shall be cut and capped in safe, dry locations posted with \"NO\nSMOKING\" signs. (d) Notice of\nblast. The blaster-in-charge shall be responsible for making sure that timely\naudible notice of every blast is given to every person in danger thereof, and\nshall not allow any blast to be detonated until all persons have been removed\nto safe locations. (e) Maximum A.C. voltage of electric blast. The A.C. voltage used to detonate any blast shall\nnot exceed 440 volts. (f) Blasting\noperations during electrical storms. All blasting operations and any handling\nof explosives shall be stopped immediately upon the approach of an electrical\nstorm, and all persons shall immediately retire to a place of safety. (g) Blasting near radio frequency energy\nsources. All blasting operations conducted in areas that could be affected by\nradio frequency radiation hazards from either permanent or mobile sources shall\nbe conducted in compliance with IME No. 20. (h) Assembly of blasting caps. Blasting caps\nshall be crimped to fuses only with implements designed for that specific\npurpose. (i) Permanent electric\nblasting lines. Permanent electric blasting lines shall be properly supported, insulated and kept in good repair. (j) Branch circuits. If branch circuits are\nused when blasts are fired from power circuits, safety switches located at safe\ndistances from the blast areas shall be provided in addition to the main\nblasting switch. (k) Blasting\nswitches. Blasting switches shall be locked in the open position except when\nclosed to fire and blast. Lead wires shall not be connected to the blasting\nswitch until the shot is ready to be fired, except for permanent electric\nblasting lines. (l) Electric\ncircuits. Electric circuits from blasting switches to the blast area shall not\nbe grounded. (m) Detonating-cord\nknots. All detonating-cord knots shall be tight and all connections shall be\nkept at right angles to the trunk lines. (n) Monitoring blasts. Blasts shall be\nmonitored for ground vibration and airblast as required by article 8 of IME no. 3. When seismographs are used they shall be properly calibrated as recommended\nby the manufacturer and monitored by a qualified operator trained by the\nmanufacturer of the device or individuals certified by the\nmanufacturer. (o) Blasting mat. Wherever any person may be endangered from the material being blasted, such\nmaterial shall be covered on all exposed sides with a strong woven matting of\nwire rope not less than one-half inch in diameter, or other equivalent covering\nwhich will be effective in preventing particles from being projected into the\nair by the blast. (p) Public\nutilities. Explosives shall not be detonated in violation of the requirements\nof subdivisions 1 and 2 of section\n322-a\nof\nthe General Business Law of New York State relating to operations carried out\nin the vicinity of public utility facilities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n61-4.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
