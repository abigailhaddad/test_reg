  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 227-1.3 - Particulate emissions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon\npromulgation of this regulation, no owner or operator of an existing stationary\ncombustion installation which fires oil or oil in combination with other liquid\nor gaseous fuels shall be allowed to emit particulate matter in excess of 0.10\npound per million Btu heat input. Within four years of the promulgation of this\nregulation, no owner or operator of an existing stationary combustion\ninstallation firing solid fuel shall be allowed to emit particulate matter in\nexcess of 0.10 pound per million Btu heat input. Upon the commencement of\noperation, no owner or operator of a new stationary combustion installation\nshall be allowed to emit particulate matter in excess of 0.10 pound per million\n\nBtu heat input. The above emission limits apply to stationary combustion\ninstallations with a maximum heat input capacity equal to or exceeding: (1)\n1 million Btu per hour firing any amount\nof solid fuel; or\n(2)\n50 million\n\nBtu per hour firing oil or oil in combination with other liquid or gaseous\nfuels. (b) When two or\nmore stationary combustion installations are connected to a common air cleaning\ndevice and/or stack, the total heat input of all the connected emission sources\nshall be the heat input for the purpose of determining the applicability of\nsubdivision (a) of this Section, unless there is a limit in the facility's\npermit that prohibits operation of the connected emission sources below the\nspecified heat inputs in subdivision (a) of this Section. (c) All stationary combustion installations\nsubject to the requirements of this subpart shall perform an annual tune-up of\ntheir equipment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n227-1.3\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register February 10, 2021/Volume XLIII, Issue 06, eff. 2/25/2021\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
