Such State\napproval will be dependent on a review of data submitted by the local social\nservices district covering such factors as quality, standards, adequacy of\nprotection, extent and duration of coverage, and cost analyses which\ndemonstrate that the plan will assure prompt, adequate medical care to\nindividuals at reasonable cost.
