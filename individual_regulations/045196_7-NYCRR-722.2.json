  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 722.2 - General information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Local\npost offices provide facilities with bulk delivery service only, sorting all\nmail by facility address, not the individual addressee. The post office's\nresponsibility ends when such mail is delivered to the facility\naddress. (b) Once the mail is\ndelivered in bulk to the facility, it becomes the responsibility of the\ndepartment to see that each individual inmate receives all mail addressed to\nhim/her. (c) A postal change of\naddress order, which normally provides for the forwarding of an individual's\nmail, is not honored by the post office for the forwarding of inmate mail as\nthis is handled as \"bulk delivery.\" Therefore, the forwarding of inmate mail is\nthe responsibility of the department. (d) Facilities must comply with the United\n\nStates Postal Service requirements which require the facility to assume\nfinancial responsibility for forwarding any inmate mail it opens. Each facility\nwill be required to establish a procedure to verify the presence of inmates at\nthe facility prior to opening inmates' mail. When the facility opens the letter\nof an inmate no longer at the facility, it has the option of using the facility\nmail pouch or returning it to the post office for forwarding. When it is\nreturned to the post office for forwarding, it must be placed in a new\nenvelope, be properly addressed and be stamped with the appropriate amount of\npostage. (e) Facilities are also\nrequired to assume responsibility for any accountable mail for which they sign. Accountable mail is deemed to be any mail which requires a signature to be\nreceived. Once the facility signs for accountable mail, it will assume\nresponsibility for any financial cost of forwarding it to the inmate. The\nfacility will forward legal (i.e., from a judge, clerk of court or attorney), accountable mail forthwith and assume financial liability if forwarded through\nthe post office. Non-legal accountable mail may be forwarded in the facility's\nmail pouch if forwarded within five business days. (f) The correspondence unit at the facility\nwhich receives the mail is responsible for checking to see if the inmate is in\nthe facility and for the proper delivery or forwarding of all inmate\nmail.
