A specific review or update of each individual's program narrative\nshall be required on an annual basis. All staff who are responsible for\nimplementation of components of the program narrative shall participate in the\nannual review. More frequent reassessments of the individual's strengths and\nneeds as part of the program narrative will formally occur only when necessary, as indicated by dramatic changes in client behavior or interest, or by staff\nconcerns that warrant such reassessment.
