  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.14 - Secure landburial facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to owners and\noperators of facilities that dispose of hazardous waste in landfills, except as\nsection\n373-2.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. (b) Site characteristics. (1)\n\nThe soil beneath the facility shall have\na hydraulic conductivity of 10\n-5\ncentimeter per\nsecond or less, as determined by in-situ hydraulic conductivity test methods, and shall be subject to the approval of the department. (2)\n\nNo waste shall be closer than 10 feet to\nan aquifer or bedrock. (3)\n\nNo\nfacility shall be located over ground-water recharge areas serving public water\nsupplies. (4)\n\nFacilities shall be\nlocated at an elevation not less than five feet above a flood plain, unless\nprovisions have been made to prevent the encroachment of flood\nwaters. (5)\n\nAll fill areas or\nexcavations shall terminate no closer than 50 feet from the boundary lines of\nthe property on which the secure landburial facility is operated. (6)\n\nThe required horizontal separation\nbetween deposited hazardous waste and any surface waters shall be determined\nfor each secure landburial facility by reference to soil attenuation\ncharacteristics, drainage and natural man-made barriers. (c) Design and operating\nrequirements. (1)\n\nAny landfill that is\nnot covered by paragraph (3) of this subdivision or section\n373-3.14\n(j)(1)\nof\nthis Part must have a liner system for all portions of the landfill (except for\nexisting portions of such landfill). The liner system must have: (i) a liner that is designed, constructed and\ninstalled to prevent any migration of wastes out of the landfill to the\nadjacent subsurface soil or ground water or surface water at any time during\nthe active life (including the closure period) of the landfill. The liner must\nbe constructed of materials that prevent wastes from passing into the liner\nduring the active life of the facility. The composition and thickness of the\nliner, and the hydraulic conductivity of any natural material required as part\nof the liner, shall be subject to the approval of the department. In no case\nshall the hydraulic conductivity of any approved liner consisting of natural\nmaterial to be greater than 10\n-7\ncentimeter per\nsecond. The liner must be: (a) constructed of\nmaterials that have appropriate chemical properties and sufficient strength and\nthickness to prevent failure due to pressure gradients (including static head\nand external hydrogeologic forces), physical contact with the waste or leachate\nto which they are exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of installation and\nthe stress of daily operation; (b) placed upon a foundation or base capable of providing support to the liner and\nresistance to pressure gradients above and below the liner to prevent failure\nof the liner due to settlement, compression or uplift; and\n(c) installed to cover all surrounding earth\nlikely to be in contact with the waste or leachate; and\n(ii)\na leachate collection and removal system\nimmediately above the liner that is designed, constructed, maintained and\noperated to collect and remove leachate from the landfill. The commissioner\nwill specify design and operating conditions in the permit to ensure that the\nleachate depth over the liner does not exceed 30 cm (one foot). The liner may\ninclude an uppermost layer designed to protect against damage during\nconstruction of that part of the liner materials that prevent wastes from\npassing into the liner. The leachate collection and removal system must be: (a) constructed of materials that are: (1)\nchemically resistant to the waste managed\nin the landfill and the leachate expected to be generated; and\n(2)\nof sufficient strength and thickness to\nprevent collapse under the pressures exerted by overlying wastes, waste cover\nmaterials, and by any equipment used at the landfill; and\n(b) designed and operated to function without\nclogging through the scheduled closure of the landfill. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator will be\nexempted from the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision if the\ncommissioner finds, based on a demonstration by the owner or operator, that\nalternative design and operating practices, together with location\ncharacteristics, will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituents (see\nsection\n373-2.6\n[d]\nof this\n\nSubpart) into the ground water or surface water at any future time. In deciding\nwhether to grant an exemption, the commissioner will consider: (i) the nature and quantity of the\nwastes; (ii)\nthe proposed alternate\ndesign and operation; (iii)\nthe\nhydrogeologic setting of the facility, including the attenuative capacity and\nthickness of the liners and soils present between the landfill and ground water\nor surface water; and\n(iv)\nall\nother factors which would influence the quality and mobility of the leachate\nproduced and the potential for it to migrate to ground water or surface\nwater. (3)\n\nThe owner or\noperator of each new landfill unit on which construction commences after\n\nJanuary 29, 1992, each lateral expansion of a landfill unit on which\nconstruction commences after July 29, 1992, and each replacement of an existing\nlandfill unit that is to commence reuse after July 29, 1992 must install two or\nmore liners and a leachate collection and removal system above and between such\nliners. Construction commences\nis as defined in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle under \"existing facility.\"\n(i) (a) The liner system must include: (1)\na top liner designed and constructed of\nmaterials (\ne.g., a geomembrane) to prevent the migration of\nhazardous constituents into such liner during the active life and post-closure\ncare period; and\n(2)\na composite\nbottom liner, consisting of at least two components. The upper component must\nbe designed and constructed of materials (\ne.g., a geomembrane)\nto prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into this component during\nthe active life and post-closure period. The lower component must be designed\nand constructed if a breach in the upper component were to occur. The lower\ncomponent must be constructed of at least three feet (91 cm) of compacted soil\nmaterial with a hydraulic conductivity of no more than 1 ×-\n10\n-7\ncm/sec. (b) The liners must comply with clauses\n(1)(i)(\na\n), (\nb\n), and (\nc\n) of\nthis subdivision. (ii)\n\nThe leachate collection and removal system immediately above the top liner must\nbe designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to collect and remove\nleachate from the landfill during the active life and post-closure care period. The commissioner will specify design and operating conditions in the permit to\nensure that the leachate depth over the liner does not exceed 30 cm (one foot). The leachate collection and removal system must comply with clauses\n(iii)(\nc\n) and (\nd\n) of this paragraph. (iii)\n\nThe leachate collection and removal\nsystem between the liners, and immediately above the bottom composite liner in\nthe case of multiple leachate collection and removal systems, is also a leak\ndetection system. This leak detection system must be capable of detecting, collecting, and removing leaks of hazardous constituents at the earliest\npracticable time through all areas of the top liner likely to be exposed to\nwaste or leachate during the active life and post-closure care period. The\nrequirements for a leak detection system in this paragraph are satisfied by\ninstallation of a system that is, at a minimum: (a) constructed with a bottom slope of one\npercent or more; (b) constructed of\ngranular drainage materials with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 ×-\n10\n-2\ncm/sec or more and a thickness of 12 inches\n(30.5 cm) or more; or constructed of synthetic or geonet drainage materials\nwith a transmissivity of 3 ×- 10\n-5\nm\n2\n/sec or more; (c) constructed of materials that are\nchemically resistant to the waste managed in the landfill and the leachate\nexpected to be generated, and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent\ncollapse under the pressures exerted by overlying wastes, waste cover\nmaterials, and equipment used at the landfill; (d) designed and operated to minimize\nclogging during the active life and post-closure care period; and\n(e) constructed with sumps and liquid removal\nmethods (\ne.g., pumps) of sufficient size to collect and remove\nliquids from the sump and prevent liquids from backing up into the drainage\nlayer. Each unit must have its own sumps(s). The design of each sump and\nremoval system must provide a method for measuring and recording the volume of\nliquids present in the sump and of liquids removed. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator shall collect and\nremove pumpable liquids into the leak detection system sumps to minimize the\nhead on the bottom liner. (v) The\nowner or operator of a leak detection system that is not located completely\nabove the seasonal high water table must demonstrate that the operation of the\nleak detection system will not be adversely affected by the presence of ground\nwater. (4)\n\nThe\ncommissioner may approve alternate design or operating practices to those\nspecified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision if the owner or operator\ndemonstrates to the commissioner that such design and operating practices, together with location characteristics: (i) will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituent into the ground water\nor surface water at least as effectively as the liners and leachate collection\nand removal systems specified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision; and\n(ii)\nwill allow detection of\nleaks of hazardous constituents through the top liner at least as\neffectively. (5)\n\nThe\ndouble liner requirement set forth in paragraph (3) of this subdivision may be\nwaived by the commissioner for any monofill, if: (i) the monofill contains only hazardous\nwastes from foundry furnace emission controls or metal casting molding sand, and such wastes do not contain constituents which would render the wastes\nhazardous for reasons other than the toxicity characteristic in section\n371.3\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, with EPA hazardous waste numbers D004 through D017; and\n(ii)\n(a) (1)\nthe monofill has at least one liner for\nwhich there is no evidence that such liner is leaking; (2)\nthe monofill is located more than\none-quarter mile from an underground source of drinking water (as that term is\ndefined in section\n370.2\n[b]\nof this\n\nTitle); and\n(3)\nthe monofill is in\ncompliance with generally applicable ground-water monitoring requirements for\nfacilities with Part 373 permits; or\n(b) the owner or operator demonstrates that\nthe monofill is located, designed and operated to assure that there will be no\nmigration of any hazardous constituent into ground water or surface water at\nany future time. (6)\n\nThe owner or operator of any replacement\nlandfill unit is exempt from paragraph (3) of this subdivision if: (i) the existing unit was constructed in\ncompliance with the design standards of section 3004(o)(1)(A)(i) and (o)(5) of\nthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle); and\n(ii)\nthere is no reason\nto believe that the liner is not functioning as designed. (7)\n\nThe owner or operator must design, construct, operate and maintain a run-on control system capable of preventing\nflow onto the active portion of the landfill during peak discharge from at\nleast a 25-year storm. (8)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must design, construct, operate and maintain a runoff\nmanagement system to collect and control at least the water volume resulting\nfrom a 24-hour, 25-year storm. (9)\n\nCollection and holding facilities (\ne.g., tanks or basins)\nassociated with run-on and runoff control systems must be emptied or otherwise\nmanaged expeditiously after storms to maintain design capacity of the\nsystem. (10)\n\nIf the landfill\ncontains any particulate matter which may be subject to wind dispersal, the\nowner or operator must cover or otherwise manage the landfill to control wind\ndispersal. (11)\n\nThe commissioner\nwill specify in the permit all design and operating practices that are\nnecessary to ensure that the requirements of this subdivision are\nsatisfied. (d) Double-lined landfills are not exempt from section\n373-2.6\nground-water protection\nrequirements. (e) Monitoring and inspection. (1)\n\nDuring construction or installation, liners and cover systems (e.g., membranes, sheets or coatings) must be inspected for uniformity, damage and imperfections\n(e.g., holes, cracks, thin spots or foreign materials). Immediately after\nconstruction or installation: (i) synthetic\nliners and covers must be inspected to ensure tight seams and joints and the\nabsence of tears, punctures or blisters; and\n(ii)\nsoil-based and admixed liners and covers\nmust be inspected for imperfections, including lenses, cracks, channels, root\nholes or other structural nonuniformities, that may cause an increase in the\npermeability of the liner or cover. (2)\n\nWhile a landfill is in operation, it must\nbe inspected weekly and after storms to detect evidence of any of the\nfollowing: (i) deterioration, malfunctions or\nimproper operation of run-on and runoff control systems; (ii)\nproper functioning of wind dispersal\ncontrol systems, where present; and\n(iii)\nthe presence of leachate in and proper\nfunctioning of leachate collection and removal systems, where\npresent. (3)\n(i) An owner or operator required to have a\nleak detection system under paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section must record\nthe amount of liquids removed from each leak detection system sump at least\nonce each week during the active life and closure period. (ii)\n\nAfter the final cover is installed, the\namount of liquid removed from each leak detection system sump must be recorded\nat least monthly. If the liquid level in any sump stays below its pump\noperating level for two consecutive months, the amount of liquid in the sump\nmust be recorded at least quarterly. If the liquid level in the sump stays\nbelow its pump operating level for two consecutive quarters, the amount of\nliquid in the sump must be recorded at least semi-annually. If at any time\nduring the post-closure care period the pump operating level is exceeded at\nunits on quarterly or semi-annual recording schedules, the owner or operator\nmust return to monthly recording of the amount of liquid removed from each sump\nuntil the liquid level again stays below the pump operating level for two\nconsecutive months. (iii)\n\nPump operating level\nis a liquid level proposed by the owner\nor operator and approved by the commissioner based on pump activation level, sump dimensions, and level that avoids backup into the drainage layer and\nminimizes head in the sump. (f) Surveying and recordkeeping. The owner or operator of a landfill must maintain the\nfollowing items in the operating record required under section\n373-2.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart: (1)\non a map, the exact\nlocation and dimensions, including depth, of each cell with respect to\npermanently surveyed bench marks; and\n(2)\nthe contents of each cell and the\napproximate location of each hazardous waste type within each cell. (g) Closure and post-closure\ncare. (1)\n\nAt final closure of the\nlandfill or upon closure of any cell, the owner or operator must cover the\nlandfill or cell with a final cover designed and constructed to: (i) provide long-term minimization of\nmigration of liquids through the closed landfill; (ii)\nfunction with minimum\nmaintenance; (iii)\npromote drainage\nand minimize erosion or abrasion of the cover; (iv)\naccommodate settling and subsidence so\nthat the cover's integrity is maintained; and\n(v) have a permeability less than or equal to\nthe permeability of any bottom liner system or natural subsoils\npresent. (2)\n\nAfter final\nclosure, the owner or operator must comply with all post-closure requirements\ncontained in section\n373-2.7\n(g)-(j)\nof\nthis Subpart, including maintenance and monitoring throughout the post-closure\ncare period (specified in the permit under section\n373-2.7\n[g]\n). The\nowner or operator must: (i) maintain the\nintegrity and effectiveness of the final cover, including making repairs to the\ncap as necessary to correct the effects of settling, subsidence, erosion or\nother events; (ii)\nmaintain and\nmonitor the leak detection system, in accordance with clause (c)(3)(iii)(d) and\nsubparagraph (iv), and paragraph (e)(3) of this section, and comply with all\nother applicable leak detection system requirements of this Subpart; (iii)\ncontinue to operate the leachate\ncollection and removal system until leachate is no longer detected; (iv)\nmaintain and monitor the ground-water\nmonitoring system and comply with all other applicable requirements of section\n373-2.6\nof this Subpart; (v) prevent run-on and runoff from eroding or\notherwise damaging the final cover; and\n(vi)\nprotect and maintain surveyed bench\nmarks used in complying with subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (3)\n\nDuring the\npost-closure care period, if liquid leaks into a leak detection system, the\nowner or operator must notify the commissioner of the leak, in writing, within\nseven days after detecting the leak. The commissioner will modify the permit to\nrequire compliance with the requirements of section\n373-2.6\nof this\n\nSubpart. (h) Special requirements for ignitable or reactive waste. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision, and in subdivision (l) of this section, ignitable or reactive\nwaste must not be placed in a landfill, unless the waste and the landfill meet\nall applicable requirements of Part 376 of this Title, and: (i) the resulting waste, mixture or\ndissolution of material no longer meets the definition of ignitable or reactive\nwaste under section\n371.3\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(ii)\nsection\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (2)\n\nExcept for prohibited wastes which remain\nsubject to treatment standards in section\n376.4\nof this Title, ignitable\nwastes in containers may be landfilled without meeting the requirements of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, provided that the wastes are disposed of in\nsuch a way that they are protected from any material or conditions which may\ncause them to ignite. At a minimum, ignitable wastes must be disposed of in\nnonleaking containers which are carefully handled and placed so as to avoid\nheat, sparks, rupture or any other condition that might cause ignition of the\nwastes; must be covered daily with soil or other noncombustible material to\nminimize the potential for ignition of the wastes; and must not be disposed of\nin cells that contain or will contain other wastes which may generate heat\nsufficient to cause ignition of the waste. (i) Special requirements for\nincompatible wastes. Incompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and materials\n(see Appendix 29 of this Title for examples), must not be placed in the same\nlandfill cell, unless section\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (j) Special requirements for liquid\nwaste. (1)\n\nBulk or noncontainerized\nliquid waste or waste containing free liquids (whether or not sorbents have\nbeen added) must not be placed in a landfill. (2)\n\nContainers holding free liquids must not\nbe placed in a landfill unless: (i) all\nfree-standing liquid: (a) has been removed by\ndecanting, or other methods; (b) has been mixed with sorbent or solidified so that free-standing liquid is no\nlonger observed; or\n(c) has been\notherwise eliminated; or\n(ii)\nthe container is very small, such as an\nampule; or\n(iii)\nthe container is\ndesigned to hold free liquids for use other than storage, such as a battery or\ncapacitor; or\n(iv)\nthe container is\na lab pack, as defined in subdivision (l) of this section, and is disposed of\nin accordance with subdivision (l) of this section. (3)\n\nTo demonstrate the absence or presence of\nfree liquids in either a containerized or a bulk waste, the following test must\nbe used: Method 9095 (Paint Filter Liquids Test) as described in \"Test Methods\nfor Evaluating Solid Wastes, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" (EPA Publication No. SW-846 [see section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle]). (4)\n\nSorbents used to treat\nfree liquids to be disposed of in landfills must be nonbiodegradable. Nonbiodegradable sorbents are: materials listed or described in subparagraph\n(i) of this paragraph; materials that pass one of the tests in subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph; or materials that are determined by the department to\nbe nonbiodegradable through the Part 370 petition process. (i) Nonbiodegradable sorbents. (a) Inorganic minerals, other inorganic\nmaterials, and elemental carbon (\ne.g., aluminosilicates, clays, smectites, Fuller's earth, bentonite, calcium bentonite, montmorillonite, calcined montmorillonire, kaolinite, micas [illite], vermiculites, zeolites; calcium carbonate [organic free limestone]; oxides/hydroxides, alumina, lime, silica [sand], diatomaceous earth; perlite\n[volcanic glass]; expanded volcanic rock; volcanic ash; cement kiln dust; fly\nash; rice hull ash; activated charcoal/activated carbon); or\n(b) High molecular weight synthetic polymers\n(\ne.g., polyethylene, high density polyethylene (HDPE), polypropylene, polystyrene, polyacrylate, polynorborene, polyisobutylene, ground synthetic rubber, cross linked allylstyrene and tertiary butyl\ncopolymers). This does not include polymers derived from biological material or\npolymers specifically designed to be degradable; or\n(c) Mixtures of these nonbiodegradable\nmaterials. (ii)\n\nTests for\nnonbiodegradable sorbents. (a) The sorbent\nmaterial is determined to be nonbiodegradable under ASTM Method G21-70 (1984a)\n- Standard Practice for Determining Resistance of Synthetic Polymer Materials\nto Fungi (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). (b) The sorbent material is\ndetermined to be nonbiodegradable under ASTM Method G22-76 (1984b) - Standard\n\nPractice for Determining Resistance of Plastics to Bacteria (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). (c) The sorbent material is\ndetermined to be nonbiodegradable under OECD test 301B: (CO\n2\n\nEvolution [Modified Sturm Test]) as incorporated by\nreference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (k) Special requirements for\ncontainers. Unless they are very small, such as an ampule, containers\nmust be either: (1)\nat least 90\npercent full when placed in the landfill; or\n(2)\ncrushed, shredded, or similarly reduced\nin volume to the maximum practical extent before burial in the\nlandfill. (l) Disposal of small containers of hazardous waste in overpacked drums (lab\npacks). Small containers of hazardous waste in overpacked drums\n(lab packs) may be placed in a landfill if the following requirements are\nmet: (1)\n\nHazardous waste must be\npackaged in nonleaking inside containers. The inside containers must be of a\ndesign and constructed of a material that will not react dangerously with, be\ndecomposed by or be ignited by, the contained waste. Inside containers must be\ntightly and securely sealed. The inside containers must be of the size and type\nspecified in the Federal Department of Transportation (DOT) hazardous materials\nregulations ( 49 CFR parts\n173, 178\nand\n179; see 6 NYCRR\n370.1\n[e]), if those\nregulations specify a particular inside container for the waste. (2)\n\nThe inside containers must be overpacked\nin an open-head Federal DOT-specified metal shipping container (\n49 CFR\nparts\n178 and 179; see 6 NYCRR\n370.1\n[e]) of no more than 416-liter (110-gallon)\ncapacity and surrounded by, at a minimum, a sufficient quantity of sorbent\nmaterial, determined to be nonbiodegradable in accordance with paragraph (j)(4)\nof this section to completely sorb all of the liquid contents of the inside\ncontainers. The metal outer container must be full after it has been packed\nwith inside containers and sorbent material. (3)\n\nThe sorbent material used must not be\ncapable of reacting dangerously with, being decomposed by, or being ignited by\nthe contents of the inside containers in accordance with section\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. (4)\n\nIncompatible\nwastes, as defined in 6 NYCRR\n370.2\n(b), must not be placed in the same outside\ncontainer. (5)\n\nReactive wastes, other than cyanide or sulfide-bearing waste as defined in section\n371.3\n(d)(1)(v)\nof\nthis Title, must be treated or rendered nonreactive prior to packaging in\naccordance with paragraphs (1) through (4) of this subdivision. Cyanide and\nsulfide bearing reactive waste may be packed in accordance with paragraphs (1)\nthrough (4) of this subdivision without first being treated or rendered\nnonreactive. (6)\n\nSuch disposal is\nin compliance with the requirements of Part 376 of this Title. (i) Persons who incinerate lab packs\naccording to the requirements in section\n376.4\n(c)(3)(i)\nof\nthis Title may use fiber drums in place of metal outer containers. Such fiber\ndrums must meet all USDOT specifications and be overpacked according to the\nrequirements in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (m) Special requirements for hazardous\nwastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 and F027. (1)\n\nHazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 and F027 must not be placed in a landfill unless the owner or operator\noperates the landfill in accordance with a management plan for these wastes\nthat is approved by the commissioner pursuant to the standards set out in this\nparagraph, and in accordance with all other applicable requirements of this\n\nSubpart. The factors to be considered are: (i) the volume and the physical and chemical\ncharacteristics of the wastes, including their potential to migrate through the\nsoil or to volatize or escape into the atmosphere; (ii)\nthe attenuative properties of underlying\nand surrounding soils or other materials; (iii)\nthe mobilizing properties of other\nmaterials codisposed with these wastes; and\n(iv)\nthe effectiveness of additional\ntreatment, design or monitoring requirements. (2)\n\nThe commissioner may determine that\nadditional design, operating and monitoring requirements are necessary for\nlandfills managing hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 and F027 to\nreduce the possibility of migration of these wastes to ground water, surface\nwater or air to protect human health and the environment. (n) Action leakage rate. (1)\n\nThe commissioner shall approve an action\nleakage rate for landfill units subject to paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this\nsection. The action leakage rate is the maximum design flow rate that the leak\ndetection system (LDS) can remove without the fluid head on the bottom liner\nexceeding one foot. The action leakage rate must include an adequate safety\nmargin to allow for uncertainties in the design (\ne.g., slope, hydraulic conductivity, thickness of drainage material), construction, operation, and location of the LDS, waste and leachate characteristics, likelihood and amounts of other sources of liquids in the LDS, and proposed\nresponse actions (\ne.g., the action leakage rate must allow for\ndecreases in the flow capacity of the system over time resulting from siltation\nand clogging, rib layover and creep of synthetic components of the system, overburden pressures, etc.). (2)\n\nTo\ndetermine if the action leakage rate has been exceeded, the owner or operator\nmust convert the weekly or monthly flow rate from the monitoring data obtained\nunder paragraph (e)(3) of this section, to an average daily flow rate (gallons\nper acre per day) for each sump. Unless the commissioner approves a different\ncalculation, the average daily flow rate for each sump must be calculated\nweekly during the active life and closure period, and monthly during the\npost-closure care period when monthly monitoring is required under paragraph\n(e)(3) of this section. (o) Response actions. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of landfill units\nsubject to paragraph (c)(3) or (4) of this section must have an approved\nresponse action plan before receipt of waste. The response action plan must set\nforth the actions to be taken if the action leakage rate has been exceeded. At\na minimum, the response action plan must describe the actions specified in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nIf the flow rate into the leak detection\nsystem exceeds the action leakage rate for any sump, the owner or operator\nmust: (i) notify the commissioner in writing\nof the exceedance within seven days of the determination; (ii)\nsubmit a preliminary written assessment\nto the commissioner within 14 days of the determination, as to the amount of\nliquids, likely sources of liquids, possible location, size, and cause of any\nleaks, and short-term actions taken and planned; (iii)\ndetermine to the extent practicable the\nlocation, size, and cause of any leak; (iv)\ndetermine whether waste receipt should\ncease or be curtailed, whether any waste should be removed from the unit for\ninspection, repairs, or controls, and whether or not the unit should be\nclosed; (v) determine any other\nshort-term and longer-term actions to be taken to mitigate or stop any leaks; and\n(vi)\nwithin 30 days after the\nnotification that the action leakage rate has been exceeded, submit to the\ncommissioner the results of the analyses specified in subparagraphs (iii), (iv), and (v) of this paragraph, the results of actions taken, and actions\nplanned. Monthly thereafter, as long as the flow rate in the leak detection\nsystem exceeds the action leakage rate, the owner or operator must submit to\nthe commissioner a report summarizing the results of any remedial actions taken\nand actions planned. (3)\n\nTo make the leak and/or remediation determinations in subparagraphs (2)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this subdivision, the owner or operator must: (i) (a) assess the source of liquids and amounts of liquids by source; (b) conduct a fingerprint, hazardous\nconstituent, or other analyses of the liquids in the leak detection system to\nidentify the source of liquids and possible location of any leaks, and the\nhazard and mobility of the liquid; and\n(c) assess the seriousness of any leaks in\nterms of potential for escaping into the environment; or\n(ii)\ndocument why such assessments are not\nneeded.
