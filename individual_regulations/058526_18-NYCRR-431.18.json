(3)\n\nIndian child's\ntribe\nmeans the Indian tribe of which an Indian child is a member or\nis eligible for membership. If the Indian child meets the definition of an\n\nIndian child in more than one tribe, deference should be given to the tribe in\nwhich the Indian child is already a member, unless otherwise agreed to by the\ntribes. In the case of an Indian child who is a member of or eligible for\nmembership in more than one tribe, the tribes must be given an opportunity in\nany involuntary child-custody proceeding to determine which tribe should be\ndesignated as the Indian child's tribe. If they are able to agree, the\nagreed-upon Indian tribe should be the designated as the Indian child's tribe\nby the court in which the involuntary child custody proceeding with respect to\nthe Indian child is pending. If the tribes are unable to agree, the court will\ndesignate the Indian child's tribe with which the Indian child has the more\nsignificant contacts taking into consideration: (i) preference of the parents for membership\nof the child; (ii)\nlength of past\ndomicile or residence on or near the reservation of each tribe; (iii)\ntribal membership of the custodial\nparent or Indian custodian; (iv)\ninterest asserted by each tribe in response to the notice that the Indian child\nis involved in a child custody proceeding; (v) whether there has been a previous\nadjudication with respect to the child by a court of one of the tribes; and\n(vi)\nself-identification by the\nchild, if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to meaningfully\nself-identify. (4)\n\nChild custody proceedings\nmeans and includes any action, other\nthan an emergency proceeding, that may culminate in one of the following: (i) foster care placement, which means any action to remove an Indian child from his or her parent or\n\nIndian custodian for temporary placement in a foster home or foster care\nfacility or the home of a guardian or conservator where the parent or Indian\ncustodian cannot have the child returned upon demand, but where parental rights\nhave not been terminated; (ii)\nthe\ntermination of parental rights, which means any action to\nterminate the parent-child relationship; (iii)\npre-adoptive\nplacement, which means the temporary placement of an Indian child in a\nfoster home or foster care facility after the termination of parental rights, but prior to or in lieu of adoptive placement; and\n(iv)\nan\nadoptive placement, which means the permanent placement of an Indian child for adoption, including\nany action for a final decree of adoption.

(7)\n\nEmergency proceeding\nmeans and includes any court action that involves an emergency removal or\nemergency placement of an Indian child.

Such efforts must be tailored to the facts and circumstances of the case and\nmust involve and use available resources of the child's extended family, the\ntribe, Indian social services agencies and individual Indian care givers. Active efforts must be documented in the Indian child's case record. (e) In any child custody proceeding initiated\nby a social services official pursuant to section\n358-a\nor\n384-b\nof\nthe Social Services Law or article 7, 10 or 10-C of The Family Court Act, the\nsocial services official must routinely inquire whether the child is an Indian\nand notify the Family Court in writing where there is reason to know the child\ninvolved is an Indian. If the social services official subsequently receives\ninformation that provides reason to know that the child is an Indian child, such social services official must notify the court in writing. (f) (1)\nA\nsocial services official which provides an Indian child with foster care or a\nvoluntary authorized agency which provides foster care to an Indian child\npursuant to a purchase of service agreement with such district in any foster\ncare or pre-adoptive placement of an Indian child must place such Indian child\nin the least-restrictive setting that: (i) most approximates a family, taking into consideration sibling\nattachment; (ii)\nallows the Indian\nchild's special needs, if any, to be met; and\n(iii)\nis in reasonable proximity to the\n\nIndian child's home, extended family, or siblings. (2)\n\nSuch social services official or\nvoluntary authorized agency must in the absence of good cause to the contrary, place the child according to the following preferences: (i) first, with a member of the Indian\nchild's extended family, as such term is defined by the law or custom of the\n\nIndian child's tribe or, in the absence of such law or custom, with a person\nwho has reached the age of 18 and who is the child's grandparent, aunt or\nuncle, brother or sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, niece or nephew, first or second cousin or stepparent; (ii)\nsecond, in a foster home licensed, certified, approved or specified by the Indian child's tribe; (iii)\nthird, with Indian foster parents who\nhave been licensed, certified or approved by a social services district or\nvoluntary authorized agency to provide foster care services; and\n(iv)\nfourth, in a foster care facility for\nchildren approved by an Indian tribe or operated by a Indian organization which\nhas a program suitable to meet the needs of the child. (3)\n\nGood cause not to follow the order of\npreference set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision must be based on one\nor more of the following considerations: (i) the request of one or both of the biological parents, if they attest that they\nhave reviewed the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of\npreference or of the child if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to\nunderstand the decision that is being made; (ii)\nthe extraordinary physical, mental or\nemotional needs of the Indian child, such as specialized treatment services\nthat may be unavailable in the community where families who meet the placement\npreferences live; (iii)\nthe\nunavailability of a suitable placement after a diligent search has been\nconducted for families meeting the preference criteria established in paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision and not one has been located. For the purpose of this\nanalysis, the standards for determining whether a placement is unavailable must\nconform with prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community\nin which the Indian child's parent or extended family resides or with which the\n\nIndian child's parent or extended family members maintain social and cultural\nties. A diligent attempt to find a suitable family must include at a minimum, contact with the child's tribal social services program, a search of all State\nor county listings of available Indian homes and contact with nationally or\nlocally known Indian program with available placement resources; or\n(iv)\nthe presence of a sibling attachment\nthat can be maintained only through a particular placement. (4)\n\nIf the Indian child's tribe\nhas established by resolution an order of preference different than that\nestablished in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the social services official\nor voluntary authorized agency must follow the order of preference established\nby the resolution, provided the placement would be in the least restrictive\nsetting appropriate to the particular needs of the child. (5)\n\nWhere a parent of an Indian child has\nvoluntarily consented to the transfer of care and custody of the child to an\nauthorized agency and has expressed a desire to the agency for anonymity, the\nsocial services official or voluntary authorized agency must consider the\ndesire for anonymity in applying the preferences established in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision or the preferences established by resolution of the child's\n\nIndian tribe. A request for anonymity does not otherwise release the social\nservices official or voluntary authorized agency from any duty of compliance\nwith the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 ( P.L. 95-608) or this section, including, but not limited to, verification of whether the child is an Indian\nchild as defined in subdivision (a) of this section. (6)\n\nAll foster care placements made by social\nservices officials or voluntary authorized agencies pursuant to this\nsubdivision must be made in foster homes which have been certified or approved\nby a social services district or voluntary authorized agency or in foster care\nfacilities licensed by the Office of Children and Family Services. (7)\n\nThe standards to be applied by a social\nservices official or the voluntary authorized agency in approving placements\nthat comply with the preference requirements of this subdivision must be the\nprevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the\nparent or extended family resides or which the parent or extended family\nmembers maintain social and cultural ties. (g) (1)\nA\nsocial services official or voluntary authorized agency that places an Indian\nchild in an adoptive home must, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, place the child according to the following preferences: (i) first, with a member of the Indian\nchild's extended family, as such term is defined by the law or custom of the\n\nIndian child's tribe or, in the absence of such law or custom, with a person\nwho has reached the age of 18 and who is the child's grandparent, aunt or\nuncle, brother or sister, brother-in-law or sister-in-law, niece or nephew, first or second cousin or stepparent; (ii)\nsecond, with other members of the Indian\nchild's tribe; and\n(iii)\nthird, with other Indian families. (2)\n\nGood cause not to follow the order of\npreference set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision must be based on one\nor more of the following considerations: (i) the request of one or both of the biological parents, if they attest that they\nhave reviewed the placement options, if any, that comply with the order of\npreference, or the child when the child is of sufficient age and capacity to\nunderstand the decision that is being made; (ii)\nthe extraordinary physical or emotional\nneeds of the Indian child, such as specialized treatment services that may be\nunavailable in the community where families who meet the placement preferences\nlive; (iii)\nthe unavailability of\nsuitable families for placement after a diligent search has been completed for\nfamilies meeting the preference criteria established by paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. For the purposes of this analysis, the standards for determining\nwhether a placement is unavailable must conform to the prevailing social and\ncultural standards of the Indian community in which the Indian child's parent\nor extended family resides or with which the Indian child's parent or extended\nfamily members maintain social and cultural ties. A diligent attempt to find a\nsuitable family must include at a minimum, contact with the child's tribal\nsocial services program, a search of all State or local listings of available\n\nIndian homes and contact with nationally or locally known Indian programs with\navailable placement resources; or\n(iv)\nthe presence of a sibling attachment\nthat can be maintained only through a particular placement. (3)\n\nIf the Indian child's tribe\nhas established by resolution an order of preference different than that\nestablished in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the social services official\nor voluntary authorized agency must follow the order of preference established\nby the resolution, provided the placement would be in the least restrictive\nsetting appropriate to the particular needs of the child. (4)\n\nWhere a parent of an Indian child has\nvoluntarily consented to the transfer of guardian and custody of the child to\nan authorized agency and has expressed a desire to the agency for anonymity, the social services official or voluntary authorized agency must consider the\ndesire for anonymity in applying the preferences established in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision or the preferences established by resolution of the child's\n\nIndian tribe. A request for anonymity does not otherwise release the social\nservices official or voluntary authorized agency from any duty of compliance\nunder the Indian Child Welfare Act ( P.L. 95-608) or this section, including, but not limited to, verification whether the child is an Indian child as\ndefined in subdivision (a) of this section. (5)\n\nThe standards to be applied by a social\nservices official or voluntary authorized agency in approving placements which\ncomply with the preference requirements of this subdivision must be the\nprevailing social and cultural standards for the Indian community which the\nparent or extended family resides or with which the parent or extended family\nmembers maintain social and cultural ties. (h) When a local social services official is\naware that a child in receipt of foster care or adoption services is an Indian\nchild or that an application for foster care or adoption services is being\nsubmitted on behalf of an Indian child, the official shall determine to the\nextent possible whether the child is a resident, domiciliary or ward of a\ntribal court in New York State or another state. If the child is a resident, domiciliary or ward of a tribal court in New York State or another state, the\nlocal social services official shall advise the Family Court that the child\nshould be returned to the jurisdiction of the tribal court. In the event that\nthe court orders the child returned to the jurisdiction of the appropriate\ntribal court, the social services official may provide social services and/or\nfoster care services to the child for 30 days after such order. The services\nprovided to the child during this period shall be subject to reimbursement in\naccordance with the provisions of section\n153\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
