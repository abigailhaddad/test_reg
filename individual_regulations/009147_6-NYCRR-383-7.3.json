  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 383-7.3 - Design and construction requirements for associated facilities and support systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General\nrequirements. (1)\n\nThe design life of each\nassociated facility and support system must be consistent with the performance\nobjectives and the required period for which the facility or system must\nreliably function. (2)\n\nDesign\ndetails of the associated facilities and support systems, including all utility\nservices, must be provided as part of the application. The design details must\ndescribe each associated facility and support system including components; design criteria codes; standards used for design; and the impact of the\nshutdown of the associated facility or support system on overall land disposal\nfacility operations. (b) Utility systems. The land disposal facility design must provide for utility\nsystems and services necessary for facility construction and operation, including communication, electrical service, water supply, lighting, sanitary\nwaste disposal, fuel delivery, and storage. Details on the design of each\nsystem must be provided as part of the application and include a designation of\nsystem components, design criteria, codes, and standards used in the design, the impact of system failure on facility operation, and necessary emergency\nstandby or backup systems to be incorporated. (c) Security. The land disposal facility\ndesign must include site security facilities in accordance with Subpart 383-14\nof this Part. (d) Receiving area. The land disposal facility design must include a receiving area that will\nprovide adequate space, based on the expected rate and frequency of waste\nshipments to the facility, for the temporary storage of waste prior to\ninspection. (e) Inspection and\ntesting facilities. The land disposal facility design must include facilities\nfor the waste package inspection and testing program required by section\n383-8.4\nof this Part. (f) Facilities for unacceptable wastes. The\nland disposal facility design must include a separate area of adequate size for\nstorage of unacceptable wastes awaiting reprocessing, repackaging, or return to\nthe generator or shipper, and facilities properly equipped to isolate and\nreturn or reprocess all unacceptable waste received. (g) Temporary storage facilities. The land\ndisposal facility design must include facilities for temporary storage of waste\nat the disposal facility. The temporary storage facilities must be designed to: (1)\nsafely store, at a minimum, a six-month\nvolume of waste; (2)\nprovide\nshielding which meets the requirements of section\n382.13\nof this Title; (3)\nkeep the waste dry, protected from the\nelements and major natural phenomena, and segregated from other activities on\nthe site that could adversely affect the integrity of the waste package or the\nwaste form; (4)\nprovide the\nseparate storage areas required by section\n383-8.5\n(c)(3) and\n(4)\nof this Part; (5)\nstore and prevent the decomposition of\nthe radioactive wastes identified in section\n383-8.3\n(a)(1) through\n(3)\nof this Part prior to incineration on the\nsite, if applicable (for example, by storage in a freezer); (6)\nprovide for prompt response to\nfires; (7)\nprovide for ease of\ndecontamination and minimization of the spread of contamination; and\n(8)\nprovide for waste minimization for waste\ngenerated at the disposal site. (h) Waste treatment facilities. Unless\nprovisions are made for off-site waste treatment, the land disposal facility\ndesign must include on-site waste treatment facilities that are capable of\ntreating and packaging for disposal all waste generated from on-site activities\nincluding equipment and vehicle washdown; runoff collection; waste packaging, volume reduction, inspection, testing, sampling, analysis, treatment, incineration, and handling; and environmental monitoring. (i) Site grading and surface water control. The disposal site design must include grading and surface water control\nfeatures to direct surface water drainage and upgradient surface water away\nfrom the disposal units at velocities and gradients that would not result in\nerosion or deposition that could adversely affect the ability of the land\ndisposal facility to meet the performance objectives. (j) Surface drainage collection and\ntreatment. The land disposal facility design must include one or more surface\ndrainage systems serving those portions of the site on which waste is present\nat any time for any reason, including transportation, receipt, inspection, storage, treatment, or disposal. These surface drainage systems must meet the\nfollowing requirements: (1)\n\nEach surface\ndrainage system must be designed to handle the peak runoff from a 1-in-500 year\ndesign storm. (2)\n\nThe design of the\nsurface drainage systems must provide for the collection, sampling, treatment\n(if necessary), and release of the collected runoff in accordance with the\napplicable requirements of this Title. (k) Fire prevention and protection\nprovisions. The land disposal facility design must incorporate provisions for\nadequate fire prevention and protection including necessary equipment, systems, and facilities for preventing fires and protecting the land disposal facility\nand personnel from fire and radiation exposure hazards in case of a fire. The\nfire prevention and protection provisions must meet the following minimum\nrequirements: (1)\n\nAll fire prevention and\nprotection provisions must be designed and constructed in accordance with the\n\nNational Fire Protection Association Codes NFPA 801-1991, Recommended Fire\n\nProtection Practice for Facilities Handling Radioactive Materials and NFPA\n901-1990, Uniform Coding for Fire Protection (see section\n383-1.8\nof this Part). (2)\n\nFire protection systems must include\non-site and off-site warning systems and an on-site alarm system for reporting\nand responding to a fire. (3)\n\nThe\nfire prevention and protection provisions must include fire-retardant building\nmaterials, fire detection equipment, fire fighting equipment, fire\nextinguishing systems. (4)\n\nThe fire\nprevention and protection provisions must be designed to respond to all\ncredible fires that may occur at the land disposal facility including the\nfollowing: (i) fires in closed disposal\nunits; (ii)\nfires in disposal units\nthat have not yet been closed; (iii)\nfires in the waste storage area; and\n(iv)\nfires resulting from\ntransportation accidents. (l) Emergency facilities. The land disposal\nfacility design must include emergency facilities for responding to radioactive\nwaste spills, personnel injuries, and other operation emergencies. The\nfollowing emergency systems and facilities must be included in the land\ndisposal facility design: (1)\nemergency\npersonnel showers and decontamination facilities which must be clearly posted\nand located in potential hazard areas for quick and easy access for personnel\ndecontamination purposes; (2)\non-site warning and alarm systems to alert on-site personnel of an accident\noccurrence and the need for response; (3)\non-site facilities to administer first\naid and treatment to injured personnel; (4)\non-site laboratories to promptly analyze\nenvironmental radiation samples; (5)\nan on-site emergency control center; and\n(6)\non-site emergency training\nfacilities. (m) Emergency standby power and systems. The land disposal facility must be\ndesigned and constructed to include emergency standby power and/or adequate\nbackup systems to maintain, during a power outage or other related emergency\noccurrence, the operation of all systems that are essential to facility\noperation and/or health and safety including the following: (1)\nsecurity and alarm systems; (2)\nmonitoring and operations warning\nsystems; (3)\nventilation systems in\nwaste storage and handling areas and buildings; (4)\nlighting in all critical operations\nareas; and\n(5)\nother essential\nsystems and services that, were they to become inoperable, would pose a\npotential health risk to the facility personnel, the surrounding public, and/or\nthe environment. (n) Incinerators. Incinerators on the site must comply with the applicable\nprovisions of Parts 200, 201, 211, 212, 219, 257, and 373 of this\n\nTitle. (o) The land disposal\nfacility must include adequate office space for the department's on-site\nenvironmental monitors as required by section\n383-15.1\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n383-7.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
