  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6.17 - Executive order no. 17: establishing the joint enforcement task force on employee misclassification\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, an increasing number of employers in New York and\nelsewhere are improperly classifying individuals they hire as \"independent\ncontractors\", even when those workers legally should be classified as\n\"employees\" (hereinafter referred to as \"employee misclassification\"); and\nWHEREAS, employers sometimes engage in employee\nmisclassification in an attempt to avoid the employers' legal obligations under\nthe federal and state labor, employment and tax laws, including laws governing\nminimum wage, overtime, prevailing wage, unemployment insurance, workers'\ncompensation insurance, temporary disability insurance, wage payment and income\ntax; and\nWHEREAS, employee misclassification has a significant\nadverse impact on the residents, businesses and economy in New York, because\nthis practice: (1)\ndeprives\nvulnerable workers of protections and benefits that they need and to which they\nare legally entitled; (2)\nreduces\ncompliance with employment and safety standards; (3)\ngives employers who misclassify their\nemployees an improper competitive advantage over law-abiding businesses; (4)\ndeprives the State of\nsubstantial revenues; and\n(5)\nimposes indirect costs on the State from decreased legitimate business activity\nand increased demand for social services; and\nWHEREAS, a recent study based on audits of New York\nemployment records between 2002 and 2005 found that up to 10% of the employees\ncovered by the audits may have been misclassified; and\nWHEREAS, law enforcement activities in this area\nhistorically have been divided among various agencies, reducing the efficiency\nand effectiveness of enforcement; and\nWHEREAS, enforcement efforts to address the problem of\nemployee misclassification can be enhanced and made more efficient through\ninteragency cooperation, information sharing, and joint prosecution of serious\nviolators; and\nWHEREAS, the creation of joint task forces has proven to be\nan effective mechanism for coordinating and enhancing labor law enforcement, including efforts by other States to address the problem of employee\nmisclassification; NOW THEREFORE, I, Eliot Spitzer, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the Constitution\nand laws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: 1.
