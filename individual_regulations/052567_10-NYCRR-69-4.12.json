Such monitoring may include site visits: (1)\n\nThe service coordinator shall report to the municipality, in a format and frequency determined by the municipality, on the delivery of services to an eligible child in accordance with the child's individualized family service plan. (i) The municipality may submit a written request to the parent, in accordance with section\n69-4.17\n(b) of this Subpart, requesting that the parent select a new service coordinator, if the municipality finds that the service coordinator has not been fulfilling his or her responsibilities to the child and family or that services have not been provided in accordance with the child's individualized family service plan. If the parent consents to the request, the individualized family service plan shall be reviewed, in accordance with procedures set forth in section\n69-4.11\n(b) of this Subpart, and amended to include the name of the new service coordinator responsible for implementation of the individualized family service plan. (ii)\n\nThe municipality may require the service coordinator to select a new provider of service if the municipality finds that services have not been delivered in accordance with the child's individualized family service plan. In such cases, the early intervention official shall provide written notice to the parent of the determination, in accordance with procedures set forth in section\n69-4.17\n(b) of this Subpart. (2)\n\nIf the early intervention official determines that the evaluator has not complied with the Public Health Law or requirements in section\n69-4.8\nof this Subpart in conducting an evaluation to determine eligibility, the early intervention official may require that the evaluator immediately submit additional documentation to support the eligibility determination of a child for the Early Intervention Program.
