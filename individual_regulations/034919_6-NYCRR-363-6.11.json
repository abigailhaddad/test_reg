  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.11 - Leachate collection and gas condensate pipes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The following requirements apply to\nleachate collection and gas condensate pipes: (1)\n\nThe primary and secondary leachate\ncollection and removal system and the gas collection condensate piping system\nmust be designed and built to allow for representative sampling of leachate and\ncondensate and to operate with proper maintenance without clogging during the\nlandfill's active life and post-closure care period. The primary collection\npipe network must be sized for peak flow attributed to a 24-hour-25-year storm\nto be removed from the landfill cell within seven days or less. (2)\n\nAll leachate collection pipe networks\nlocated in the primary and secondary leachate collection and removal systems\nmust be designed to allow for accessibility of equipment for effective video\nmonitoring, routine cleaning and maintenance of key collection lines in each\nseparately operating cell. (3)\n\nAll\nleachate conveyance lines, gas condensate lines and appurtenances, including\nmanholes, sumps, and metering pits located outside the liner system of the\nlandfill must be designed to have double containment and must be constructed to\nprovide for effective leak detection and collection. (4)\n\nLeachate conveyance lines, gas condensate\nlines and appurtenances including manholes, sumps, and metering pits located\noutside the landfill liner system are not required to maintain the minimum\nseparation of five feet from the seasonal high groundwater table, and are not\nrequired to maintain the minimum separation of ten feet from bedrock. (b) Materials required. The\nleachate collection pipes must: (1)\nbe a\nminimum of eight inches in inside nominal diameter for primary pipes and six\ninches in inside nominal diameter for secondary pipes; (2)\nhave adequate structural strength to\nsupport the maximum static and dynamic loads and stresses that will be imposed\nby the overlying material, including the drainage layer, liners, waste\nmaterial, and any equipment used in the construction and operation of the\nlandfill; and\n(3)\nbe chemically\ncompatible with leachate. (c) Construction requirements. Leachate\ncollection pipes must be installed in accordance with the requirements of the\napproved engineering drawings, reports, and specifications and must be designed\nto have a minimum slope of one percent. (d) Certification requirements. The project\nengineer must certify that the requirements of paragraphs 363-6.6(a)(3) and (4)\nof this Subpart are met and that all leachate collection pipes are cleaned, debeaded and inspected upon completion of construction using video inspection\nequipment or other methods acceptable to the department to verify that the\nsystem is free of obstructions and construction-related debris.
