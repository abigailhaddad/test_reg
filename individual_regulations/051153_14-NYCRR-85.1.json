  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 85.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part is\nintended to promote the application of the most effective methods by which the\nmentally ill, mentally retarded and alcoholics may be helped to achieve maximum\nself-sufficiency while providing for their safety and general well-being to the\nextent that it does not prevent them from the practice of social skills in the\nnatural round of life. (b) The\npurpose of therapeutic programs for the mentally ill or the mentally retarded\nis to improve the social competence of those they serve. Outpatient or\nambulatory programs contribute to the accomplishment of this purpose by\nfostering the practice of social skills in the natural round of life. There\nare, however, differences between mental illness and mental retardation which\nrequire varying emphases in programs. An essential program component for the\nmentally ill is psychiatric treatment; for the mentally retarded primary\nmodalities are therapeutic education and training. It is, however, a common\npurpose addressed to social competence which has led to most development of\nshort-term problem-oriented treatment approaches, group methods, and services\nto family members together, regardless of the mental condition. (c) The Mental Hygiene Law requires the\ncertification of any nonresidential or outpatient facility operated by a\ncorporation or a public agency to provide examination, diagnosis, care, treatment, rehabilitation or training to people with a disturbance in behavior, feeling, thinking or judgment so severe as to require care and treatment to\npeople with subaverage intellectual functioning which originates during the\ndevelopmental period and is associated with impairment in adaptive behavior, or\nto people who habitually use alcoholic beverages to the extent that this is\nbeyond their control or endangers health, safety or welfare. A number of terms\nare in common usage to refer to such facilities, among them being psychiatric\nclinic, mental health clinic, child guidance clinic, day hospital, day training\ncenter and alcoholism clinic. In an effort to make more comfortable their\nutilization by the mentally handicapped, some outpatient facilities have made\nuse of less distinctive titles. (1)\n\nWhile\nmany forms of organized community supportive services available to the general\npublic are of great value to those with mental handicaps as well, and are made\navailable to them as needful members of the general public, this Part is not\nintended to apply to such services in the absence of a primary purpose to\nprovide services to the mentally disabled as defined in the Mental Hygiene\n\nLaw. (2)\n\nSpecialized methods of\ntraining the mentally ill and mentally retarded in life skills on an outpatient\nbasis having become an established service for the mentally disabled, this Part\nis intended to apply to nonresidential facilities which provide day training\nprograms or day treatment programs for the mentally disabled. (d) This Part prescribes standards\nfor certification. Certification of itself does not confer eligibility to\nreceive financial support from any governmental source. (e) It is the intent of this Part to foster\nincreased responsibility of outpatient facilities for the mentally disabled to\nevaluate and review their own services. The number and type of services may\nvary among different outpatient facilities depending upon local needs, the age\ngroups and diagnostic groups served, the services provided by others in the\nsame geographic area, the availability of staff, and the service capacity of\nthe outpatient facility. This Part does not stipulate any specific modalities\nof care, staff training and experience or numbers, or admission criteria. They\nrequire, however, that the facility prepare an adequate plan for services which\naddresses these issues and establishes organization policies and procedures\nwhich will facilitate implementation of the plan.
