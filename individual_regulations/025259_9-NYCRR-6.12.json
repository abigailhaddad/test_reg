  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6.12 - Executive order no. 12: representation of child care providers\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, child care providers perform an essential service\nfor working parents and guardians in this state by creating a safe, enjoyable\nand educational home-like environment for their children; and\nWHEREAS, many of New York's children spend a significant\npart of their crucial, early years of development under the supervision of\nchild care providers; and\nWHEREAS, to promote the availability of affordable quality\nchild care, it is in the public interest for New York to maintain a child care\ndelivery system that fosters a multiplicity of quality child care options to\ndeliver these vital services; and\nWHEREAS, some child care providers receive compensation or\nbenefits, or work in conditions, that may not be commensurate with the value of\nthe work that they perform; and\nWHEREAS, long hours, limited benefits and low pay for child\ncare providers can drive them from the market, thereby limiting the\navailability of quality care; and\nWHEREAS, the State of New York regulates certain child care\nproviders, and provides social services districts with funding through block\ngrants to assist low income families in purchasing child care; and\nWHEREAS, many child care providers lack an organized voice\nin governmental decisionmaking on issues that impact the manner in which they\ncarry out their profession; and\nWHEREAS, creating a framework for child care providers to\nsecure representation can help improve the environment in which they work, and\nthe benefits and funding that they receive; and\nWHEREAS, child care providers should be given the option to\norganize themselves and select representatives for the purpose of discussing\nwith the State the conditions of their employment, the stability, funding and\noperation of child care programs, and the expansion of quality child\ncare; NOW, THEREFORE, I, Eliot Spitzer, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the\nlaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: 1. For purposes of this Order, \"child care\nprovider\" shall mean an operator of a group family day care home as defined in\n\nSocial Services Law § 390(1)(d) or a family day care home as defined in\n\nSocial Services Law § 390(1)(e), or an individual providing child care in\na residence to one or more children who are receiving child care assistance\nunder Title 5-C of the Social Services Law under circumstances where the\nindividual is not required to be licensed or registered under Social Services\n\nLaw § 390, or to be licensed under the Administrative Code of the City of\n\nNew York. 2. Soley for purposes of\nthis Order, New York's child care providers shall be divided into four\nrepresentation units: (a) all child care\nproviders in New York City who are paid from funds administered by New York\n\nCity pursuant to Social Services Law § 410-u; (b) all registered or licensed child care\nproviders in New York City who are not paid from funds administered by New York\n\nCity pursuant to Social Services Law § 410-u; (c) all registered or licensed child care\nproviders outside New York City; and\n(d) all child care providers outside New York\n\nCity who provide child care in a residence to one or more children who are\nreceiving child care assistance under Title 5-C of the Social Services Law\nunder circumstances where the individual is not required to be licensed or\nregistered under Social Services Law § 390. 3. For the purposes of this Order, New York\n\nState shall recognize as the representative of the child care providers in any\nunit set forth in Paragraph 2 of this Order such representative as is\ndesignated by a majority of the providers in the unit. 4. Any prospective representative may\ndemonstrate majority designation by submitting authorization cards approving\nits representation, signed within twelve months of their submission by the\nmajority of providers comprising the unit, to the State Employment Relations\n\nBoard or any successor agency (\"SERB\") for the purpose of such review. SERB or\nits designee shall review the cards and, if it determines that they constitute\nat least 50 percent plus one of the providers in the unit at issue, shall\ncertify the party making the application as the designated representative of\nthat unit. If SERB determines that the cards constitute at least 30 percent of\nthe providers in the unit at issue, but no more than 50 percent, it shall\nconduct an election in a manner directed by SERB, and consistent with its\nstandard election procedures, to determine if the majority of members designate\nthe prospective representative. 5. Any relevant state agencies, including the Office of Children and Family\n\nServices (\"OCFS\"), shall provide SERB with such reasonable information as is\nnecessary in determining the size of the units and the identities of their\nmembers, subject to any limitations on dissemination of such information that\nthe agency believes necessary to protect confidentiality, or as otherwise\nrequired by law. 6. Any party\nseeking to challenge the status of a unit representative designated under the\nprocedures of this Order may submit information to SERB indicating that a\nmajority of the unit wishes to be represented by a different representative, or\ndo not wish to be represented under the terms of this Order. SERB shall\ndetermine whether the information provides a reasonable basis for such a\nconclusion. If SERB so determines, it shall adopt such process as it believes\nto be warranted to ascertain the majority's choice of representation, including\nby the submission of authorization cards or election, unless such process had\nbeen undertaken in the previous two years. 7. OCFS shall meet with designated\nrepresentatives of those units of child care providers determined pursuant to\nthe procedures set forth in this Order, either separately or jointly, for the\npurpose of entering into a written agreement to the extent feasible. The\nagreement may address the stability, funding and operation of child care\nprograms; expansion of quality child care; and improvement of working\nconditions, including subsidies, benefits or payment, for child care providers. If the issues under discussion require the participation and approval of other\nstate agencies, those agencies shall participate in the discussions. Nothing in\nthis Order shall require that an agreement be reached on any such\nmatters. 8. In the event that\nagreement is reached it shall be embodied in writing between OCFS and any other\naffected agency, and the designated representative for the applicable unit\ncovered by the agreement. The agreement shall be binding on the State of New\n\nYork, contingent upon the successful completion of such regulatory or\nlegislative action as may be required to implement the terms of the\nagreement. 9. If any provisions of\nthe agreement require legislative action, or require the appropriation of funds\nin order to be effective, the parties will jointly seek legislation or\nappropriation. If any provisions of the agreement require the adoption or\nmodification of rules and regulations of any department or agency of State\ngovernment to be effective, the department or agency shall seek the adoption or\nmodification of such rules or regulations through appropriate regulatory\naction, as consistent with the New York State Administrative Procedure Act. In\nseeking such legislation or regulatory change, nothing in this Order shall bar\nthe State and its agencies from applying, or require the State and its agencies\nto apply, the same terms contained in any agreement under this Order to any\nchild care providers not represented by the unit(s) that signed the agreement, including child care centers, to the extent the State and its agencies deem\nappropriate. 10. In the event any\ndispute arises under the terms of this Order, on the application of any unit\nrepresentative, OCFS or any other involved state agency, SERB may direct the\nparties to engage in non-binding mediation under such terms and conditions as\nit may deem appropriate. 11. Nothing in this Order shall: a. permit child\ncare providers collectively to engage in any strike or work action to secure\nany right or privilege from the State or any of its agencies or political\nsubdivisions; b. render any child\ncare provider a state officer or public employee, or in any way imply any\nemployer-employee relationship between the child care operator and the State or\nits subdivisions for any purpose, including but not limited to any public\nretirement system, membership in any public health insurance program, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, disability coverage, New York\n\nCivil Service Law, or indemnification under New York Public Officers\n\nLaw; c. alter in any way any\ncurrent regulations, policies or procedures for health, safety, discipline, inspection or enforcement applicable to child care providers or programs, or\notherwise interfere with any enforcement procedures of OCFS or any other\nagency, unless agreed to and enacted, in accordance with the provisions of this\n\nOrder; d. interfere with the\nexisting relationship between consumers and child care providers, including the\nexisting rights of parents or guardians to choose their own provider, or to\nterminate that provider's services at any time; e. interfere with any ability that child care\nproviders, or any organization that represents such providers, may otherwise\nhave to meet or correspond with, or otherwise appear before, state agencies in\nregard to any matter of relevance, including any matter under discussion or set\nforth in any agreement between the agency and a unit representative; or f. create any contractual rights or obligations.
