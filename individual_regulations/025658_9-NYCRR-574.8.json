  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 574.8 - Conversion of resort hotels, rental cottages and group camps\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For purposes of\napplying the conversion provision of section 81 l(l)(b) of the Adirondack Park\n\nAgency Act, structures associated with resort hotels, rental cottages and group\ncamps shall only include a single or multiple family dwelling, dormitory, hotel, main lodge, cabin, cottage, bungalow, bunkhouse or other structure which\nis permanently affixed to the land and is suitable for conversion to single\nfamily residential use, taking into account its existing character, condition\nand facilities, and general site considerations. (b) In the review of conversions pursuant to\nsection 811(1)(b) of the Adirondack Park Agency Act, the agency will apply the\nfollowing criteria: (1)\nA structure shall be\nconverted only at its existing location unless the agency determines that the\npurposes and policies of the Adirondack Park Agency Act would be better served\nby the removal of the structure to, or the replacement of the structure at, a\ndifferent location on the project site. (2)\nA single structure containing over 1,250\nsquare feet of net interior floor space as of May 22, 1973 may be converted to\nmore than one single family residential unit at the approximate rate of one\nunit for each 1,250 square feet of floor space in the structure prior to\nconversion; however, there shall be no fixed square footage requirement for the\nresulting units. (3)\n\nFor the\npurpose of determining whether any additional principal buildings may be\nconstructed on the project site, each single family residential unit resulting\nfrom the conversion shall be considered a new principal building, and the\noverall intensity guidelines will be applied pursuant to the Adirondack Park\n\nAgency Act and section 547.7 of this Part. All contiguous or adjacent lands\nassociated with the prior use or in the same ownership shall be included in the\narea upon which the overall intensity guidelines will be applied. (c) The agency will, upon request\nand after an application is complete, advise whether a conversion proposal\nmeets the criteria of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n574.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
