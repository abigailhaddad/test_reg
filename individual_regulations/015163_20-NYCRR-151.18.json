  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 151.18 - Group New York State nonresident personal income tax return for nonresident professional athletes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Subchapter, a qualified\nnonresident member of a professional athletic team required to file a New York\n\nState personal income tax return pursuant to section\n651\nof the Tax Law (see section\n151.2\nof this Part) may, in lieu of filing an individual New York State personal\nincome tax return, elect to be included on a group nonresident income tax\nreturn (hereinafter referred to in this section as group return). All\nparticipating individuals must have the same accounting period. (b) Definitions. For purposes of this\nsection: (1)\n\nThe term professional athletic\nteam includes any professional sports team, including, but not limited to, a\nbaseball, basketball, football, soccer, or hockey team. A team is a single\norganization represented by a number of persons associated together in\ncollective play and supporting duties. Affiliated teams that compete in\ndifferent leagues shall be considered separate teams (e.g., major and minor\nleague teams). (2)\n\nThe term member\nof a professional athletic team shall include employees who are active players, players on the disabled list, and any persons required to travel and who travel\nwith and perform services on behalf of a professional athletic team on a\nregular basis. This includes, but is not limited to, coaches, managers, and\ntrainers. (3)\n\nThe term qualified\nmember of a professional athletic team means a member of a professional\nathletic team who meets all of the following conditions: (i) the member must be a nonresident\nindividual of New York State for the entire taxable year; (ii)\nthe member must not have maintained a\npermanent place of abode in New York State at any time during the taxable\nyear; (iii)\nif such member or such\nmember's spouse received compensation which is considered to be New York State\nsource income, pursuant to section\n132.22\nof this Title, from more than one professional athletic team during the taxable\nyear, such member or spouse is included on a group return for each team. In no\nevent shall a member or a member's spouse be allowed to file on a group basis\nfor the same taxable year in which a New York State individual income tax\nreturn is filed for such member or member's spouse; (iv)\nthe member and member's spouse must: (a) have no income derived from or connected\nwith New York State sources for the entire taxable year other than compensation\nreceived for services rendered as a member of a professional athletic team (as\ndetermined pursuant to section\n132.22\nof this Title). However, nonresident members with New York source income from\nsources other than a professional athletic team may be eligible to file on a\ngroup return under the provisions of section\n151.21\nof this Part; (b) not be subject to\nthe minimum income tax (see section\n602\nof the\n\nTax Law); or\n(c) not be subject to\nthe separate tax on the ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution (see\nsection\n603\nof the Tax Law); and\n(v) the member of a professional\nathletic team must waive the right to claim: (a) the New York standard or itemized\ndeduction; (b) dependent\nexemptions; (c) any credits against\n\nNew York State personal income tax; and\n(d) the exclusion against the total of wages\nfor purposes of the City of New York or City of Yonkers Nonresident Earnings\n\nTaxes. (c) Request for permission. A professional\nathletic team may request permission to file a group return on behalf of\nparticipating members of such team by submitting an application on a form\nprescribed by the department for such purpose (or replica, reproduction, computer-prepared form or other such form containing the prescribed\ninformation). The application must be accompanied by an individual power of\nattorney (or other evidence of authority acceptable to the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance) from each electing qualified member authorizing a common\nagent to represent such electing qualified member of a professional athletic\nteam in making, executing, or filing the return. The request must be sent to\n\nAssistant Director, Registration and Licensing Services Bureau, New York State\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, Building 8, Room 408, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. Request for permission to file a group return must be made by\nthe 30th day following the close of the taxable year for which the election is\nrequested. Permission to file a group return will be restricted to qualified\nmembers of a professional athletic team electing to participate in the filing\nof a group return. In no event shall more than one group return be filed in any\ntaxable year for the same professional athletic team. Upon receipt of a\nproperly completed application, the department will determine whether or not\nthe initial approval will be granted and will notify the team accordingly. The\ndepartment's approval to file a group return is tentative pending receipt of\nthe final group return and subject to revision or revocation on audit. A return\nfiled on a group basis does not constitute a request for permission to file a\ngroup return. A request to file a group return must include the following\ninformation: (1)\nthe name and address of the\nprofessional athletic team; (2)\nthe\nname or names of the representative(s) having the authority to act as agent(s)\nof electing qualified members of the professional athletic team, the name of\nthe representative's firm, if applicable, and the street address, city, state, and postal ZIP code of the representative's place of business; (3)\nthe identifying number (i.e., social\nsecurity number and/or employer identification number) of the representative\nhaving the authority to act as agent of the professional athletic team for the\npurposes of filing a group return; and\n(4)\nthe first taxable year for which the\ngroup return will be filed. (d) Form of return on group basis. The group\nreturn is required to be filed on the form prescribed by the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance and in the manner prescribed by the department. The group\nreturn must contain the special identifying number which will be assigned to\nthe professional athletic team upon approval by the department. The special\nidentifying number will remain in effect each year unless reassigned or\nrevoked. The group return must be signed by the representative having legal\nauthority to act as agent for all electing qualified members of the\nprofessional athletic team. In such case, the agent and each electing member\nare individually responsible for his or her part in making and signing the\nreturn. Each such agent or member, as the case may be, will incur liability for\nthose penalties provided by the Tax Law that may be imposed with respect to\nsuch individual's acts in making and signing erroneous, false, or fraudulent\n\nNew York State income tax returns. The fact that an agent's name is signed to a\ngroup return is prima facie evidence for all purposes that such return was\nactually signed by such agent. (See section\n158.12\nof this Title for Requirements Applicable To Tax Return Preparer.) The group\nreturn must be sent to New York State Income Tax, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. (e) The filing of a group\nreturn will be considered as a group of separate returns which will meet the\nindividual filing requirements of this Part. The Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance retains the right to require the filing of an individual New York State\nnonresident personal income tax return by any of the individual\nmembers. (f) The filing of a group\nreturn must include an individual power of attorney (or other evidence of\nauthority acceptable to the Department of Taxation and Finance) from each newly\nelecting qualified member which authorizes the representative of the\nprofessional athletic team to act as agent in making, executing, and filing a\ngroup return on behalf of such electing member who had not previously filed a\npower of attorney (or other evidence acceptable to the Department of Taxation\nand Finance) and a detailed schedule indicating the name of the professional\nathletic team, the special identifying number assigned to such team, and the\ntaxable year as shown on the group return. Also, for each electing qualified\nmember of the professional athletic team, such return must include the\nfollowing information: (1)\nthe member's name\nand address (in alphabetical order by last name or other order acceptable to\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance); (2)\nthe member's social security\nnumber; (3)\nthe total compensation\nreceived during the taxable year for services rendered as a member of the\nprofessional athletic team, both within and without New York State; (4)\nthe number of duty days spent within New\n\nYork State rendering services for the team and the total number of duty days\nspent both within and without New York State during the taxable year (see\nsection\n132.22\nof this Title); (5)\nthe amount of\ntotal compensation paid by the team allocable to New York State, pursuant to\nsection\n132.22\nof this Title, for each member; (6)\nthe New York State personal income tax as determined in accordance with\nsubdivision (g) of this section for each member; (7)\nthe New York State estimated income tax\nor withholding tax, as the case may be, paid by or on behalf of each member\n(wage and tax statements must accompany the filing of the group\nreturn); (8)\nthe balance due or\noverpayment (any overpayment will not be refunded, but applied to the\nrespective member's estimated income tax for the following year); (9)\nwhere such member is employed by more\nthan one professional athletic team during the taxable year, the name or names\nof such other professional athletic team; and\n(10)\nany other information the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance may require. (g) New York State personal income tax. For\npurposes of this section, a participating member's New York State personal\nincome tax is determined by multiplying such member's compensation allocable to\n\nNew York State (as determined under section\n132.22\nof this Title) by the highest effective rate of New York State personal income\ntax for the applicable taxable year. (h) If a group return is not filed for a\ntaxable year after approval has been granted, the approval to file a group\nreturn will be revoked for subsequent taxable years unless the professional\nathletic team requests permission from the department for\nreinstatement. (i) Where a\nprofessional athletic team elected to file group required installments pursuant\nto section\n185.3\n(k)(2)\nof this Title, and later determines that an individual electing member will not\nparticipate in the filing of a group return or where such individual electing\nmember fails to qualify, pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the\nprofessional athletic team should notify the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance, in writing, by the 15th day of the second month following the close of\nthe taxable year in which the member elects not to participate or fails to\nqualify, as the case may be. This will enable the department sufficient time to\ntransfer required installments of estimated tax paid on behalf of such member\non a group basis to an individual account. An electing qualified member of a\nprofessional athletic team may not change such member's election to file on a\ngroup basis to an individual basis after the 15th day of the fourth month\nfollowing the close of the taxable year in which the election is effective. (See section\n161.3\nof this Title.)\n(j) A professional\nathletic team that has been granted approval by the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance to file a group return for electing nonresident athletes must notify\nthe department, in writing, if such team decides that it will not be filing a\ngroup return for a taxable year. Such decision will revoke approval by the\ndepartment for such team to file a group return in subsequent taxable years\nunless the team requests permission from the department for\nreinstatement.
