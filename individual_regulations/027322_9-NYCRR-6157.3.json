  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6157.3 - Limits on administrative expenses\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Limits on allowable administrative\nexpenses. No less than 75 percent of the covered operating expenses of a\ncovered provider paid for with State funds or State-authorized payments shall\nbe program services expenses rather than administrative expenses. This\npercentage shall increase by five percent each year until it shall be no less\nthan 85 percent in 2015 and for each year thereafter. In determining whether an\nexpense is a program service expense or an administrative expense, a covered\nprovider may allocate a portion of the expense to each type if such allocation\nis supported by the nature of the expense. Such allocation may include\nallocation of portions of an employee's time and compensation to administrative\nor program services. Commencing on July 1, 2013, the limits on allowable\nadministrative expenses pursuant to this Part shall be effective and applicable\nto each covered provider on the first day of each provider's respective covered\nreporting period. (b) Subcontractors and agents of covered providers. The restriction on allowable\nadministrative expenses in subdivision (a) of this section and the reporting\nrequirements in section\n6157.6\nof this Part shall apply to\nsubcontractors and agents of covered providers if and to the extent that such a\nsubcontractor or agent has received State funds or State-authorized payments\nfrom the covered provider to provide program or administrative services during\nthe reporting period and would otherwise meet the definition of a covered\nprovider but for the fact that it has received State funds or State-authorized\npayments from the covered provider rather than directly from a governmental\nagency. A covered provider shall incorporate into its agreement with such a\nsubcontractor or agent the terms of these regulations by reference to require\nand facilitate compliance. Upon request, covered providers shall promptly\nreport to the funding or authorizing agency the identity of such subcontractors\nand agents, along with any other information requested by that agency or by the\ncommissioner or his or her designee. A covered provider shall not be held\nresponsible for a subcontractor's or agent's failure to comply with these\nregulations. (c) Covered providers\nreceiving state funds or state-authorized payments from county or local\ngovernment or from entity contracting on its behalf. The commissioner or his or\nher designee, rather than the county or local unit of government or an entity\ncontracting on behalf of such government, shall be responsible for obtaining\nthe necessary reporting from and compliance by such covered providers, and\nshall issue guidance to affected county and local governments to set forth the\nprocedures by which the commissioner or his or her designee shall do\nso. (d) Covered providers with\nmultiple sources of state funds or state-authorized payments. If a covered\nprovider receives State funds or State-authorized payments from multiple\nsources, the provider's compliance with the restriction on allowable\nadministrative expenses in subdivision (a) of this section shall be determined\nbased upon the total amount program services expenses and administrative\nexpenses paid for by such funding received from all of such sources. As set\nforth in section\n6157.6\nof this Part, the covered\nprovider shall report all of such State funds and State-authorized payments, and the expenses paid for by such funding, in the form and at the time\nspecified by the commissioner or his or her designee. (e) Other limits on administrative expenses. If the contract, grant, or other agreement is subject to more stringent limits\non administrative expenses, whether through law or contract, such limits shall\ncontrol and shall not be affected by the less stringent limits imposed by these\nregulations. However, the definition and interpretation of terms in this Part\nshall not be affected or limited by the definition or interpretation of terms\nin other regulations or agreements. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n6157.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
