  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.609 - Change in class location: required study\n\nState Regulations\n\nAt least once every five years or whenever an increase in\npopulation density indicates either a change in class location for a segment of\nan existing steel pipeline operating at a hoop stress that is more than 40\npercent of SMYS, or that the hoop stress corresponding to the established\nmaximum allowable operating pressure for a segment of existing pipeline is not\ncommensurate with the present class location, the operator shall immediately\nmake a study to determine: (a) the\npresent class location for the segment involved; (b) the design, construction, and testing\nprocedures followed in the original construction, and a comparison of these\nprocedures with those required for the present class location by the applicable\nprovisions of this Part; (c) the\nphysical condition of the segment to the extent it can be ascertained from\navailable records; (d) the\noperating and maintenance history of the segment; (e) the maximum actual operating pressure and\nthe corresponding operating hoop stress, taking pressure gradient into account, for the segment of pipeline involved; and\n(f) the actual area affected by the\npopulation density increase, and physical barriers or other factors which may\nlimit further expansion of the more densely populated area. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.609\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
