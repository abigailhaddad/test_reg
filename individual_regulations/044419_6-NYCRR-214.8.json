  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 214.8 - Charging hole lids and offtake piping\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Charging hole lids. No more than two\npercent of all oven lids may emit visible emissions, as measured in accordance\nwith the procedure set forth in subdivision (c) of this section. (b) Offtake piping. No more than 10 percent\nof the offtake piping on a single battery may emit visible emissions, as\nmeasured in accordance with the procedure set forth in subdivision (c) of this\nsection. (c) For the purpose of\ndetermining compliance with subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section, visible\nemissions are those emissions of any degree of opacity greater than zero\nobserved to be leaking from any point on the battery topside except from oven\nflue caps and between refractory bricks. (1)\n\nCompliance with the standard for charging hole lids will be determined while\nwalking topside along the length of the battery, observing each oven lid for\nonly that time necessary to determine whether or not there is a visible\nemission coming from the charging hole casting and lid interface, but will not\ninclude smoke from burning of smoldering excess topside coal. The observer will\nthen shift attention to the adjacent oven lids and check for emissions in the\nsame manner. The observer will continue this procedure along the entire length\nof the battery. For the purpose of inspection, an ignited dampered oven\nrequires that a flame is observed above any one charging hole. The dampered\noven will be included in the calculations for determining the percentage of\nleaking lids if there is no flame visible above the plane of the opening on any\nsingle charging hole. The percentage of leaking lids will be calculated by\ndividing the number of leaking lids by the total number of lids on the\nin-service ovens on the battery and multiplying by 100. Oven lids on a maximum\nof six dampered ovens are exempt from this procedure provided they are\nignited. (2)\n\nCompliance with the\nstandard for offtake piping will be determined while walking topside as close\nas possible to the centerline of the battery and observing the offtake piping\nof each oven for only that time necessary to determine whether or not there is\na visible emission coming from the offtake piping on that oven. In the event\nsuch positioning results in an obstructed view, the observer may assume other\npositioning to allow a clear view of the emissions. The observer will then\nshift attention to the adjacent offtake piping and check for emissions in the\nsame manner. The observer will continue this procedure along the entire length\nof the battery. For the purpose of inspection, an ignited dampered oven\nrequires that a flame is observed above any offtake piping cap opening. The\ndampered oven will be included in the calculations for determining the\npercentage of leaking offtake piping if there is no flame visible above the\nplane of the opening on the offtake pipe. The percentage of leaking offtake\npiping will be calculated by dividing the number of leaking offtake piping by\nthe total number of offtake piping on the in-service ovens on the battery and\nmultiplying by 100. Offtake piping on an oven being charged and on a maximum of\nsix dampered ovens, including an oven being pushed is exempt from this\nprocedure provided that emissions from the dampered ovens are ignited once the\noven is dampered. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n214.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
