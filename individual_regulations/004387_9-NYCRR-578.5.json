  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 578.5 - Values of particular wetlands\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following list describes several wetland covertypes and\nmost other wetland characteristics and assigns one of four value ratings to\neach. Wetlands may have one or several of these characteristics. The value\nratings indicate the overall worth of a given wetland, and in combination with\nthe standards in sections 578.6 through\n578.10\nof this Part, will provide\ngeneral guidance to applicants whether a permit will be issued pursuant to this\n\nPart. Values of Particular Wetland\n\nCovertypes\n\nValue Rating\n(a) Bogs\nare relatively specialized\ncommunities which often contain unusual plant or animal species, including many\ntypical of boreal zones, and are usually very slow-growing. 2\n(b) Classic or kettlehole bogs\nare\nvery rare, support a limited community of plants highly specialized for life in\nbogs and are very sensitive to disruption and slow to recover. 1\n(c) Emergent marsh\nis the most\nvaluable individual covertype and one of the highest in productivity of all\ntemperate ecosystems. The emergent vegetation provides nesting habitat, food\nand cover for many waterfowl and other wildlife, provides large annual\nincreases in biomass, and cycles large quantities of nutrients into food\nchains. Emergent marshes usually contrast with surrounding areas in physical\nstructure and therefore provide habitat diversity and \"edge.\" Where purple\nloosestrife\n(Lythrum salicaria)\nor reed\n(Phragmites\naustralis)\nconstitute approximately two-thirds or more of the wetland, however, the value assigned is lower (3) as these species are less productive\nand support much less wildlife use than other marsh species. 2\n(d) Deciduous swamps\nare\nfrequently used by nesting and migrating waterfowl. They are also heavily used\nby other birds and wildlife. Deciduous swamps are often intermittently flooded\nand desiccated. Their soils exhibit high fertility which promotes rapid plant\ngrowth and a wide variety of flora and fauna. Windthrow of the shallow rooted\ntrees found in such swamps tends to create habitat variety. During the growing\nseason, such swamps transpire and filter great quantities of water, contributing to the maintenance of water quality and the moderation of\nmicro-climatic conditions. 2\n(e) Deep water marsh\nmay be an\nimportant food source for waterfowl and is frequently a valuable area for fish\nspawning and nurseries. When located adjacent to a larger waterbody it is\nvaluable as well as a water storage area. 3\n(f) Shrub swamps\ngenerally have\nvariable values for fish and wildlife. Since they are likely to be of different\nvegetational structure than surrounding or adjoining areas, they often supply\nsignificant nesting and other wildlife habitat. Shrub swamps adjacent to\npermanent bodies of water are frequently flooded and provide additional water\nstorage capacity to ameliorate downstream flooding. Shrub swamps may also be\nlocated in zones subject to scouring by ice or other waterborne debris. In\nthese areas, shrub swamps, which contain species resistant to scouring damage, stabilize soil and prevent erosion and downstream sedimentation. 3\n(g) Wetlands composed of two or more\nstructural groups\nhave greater value as fish or wildlife habitat. Three structural groups are recognized for determining this value: 2\n(1) low types, found in wet meadows and emergent\nmarshes; (2) shrubs and trees, found in deciduous, coniferous\nand shrub swamps; (3) flat or water, found in deep water marshes, open\nwater and mudflats. A group must comprise at least 10 percent of the\nwetland area to be counted as a separate structural group for the purposes of\nthis subdivision. (h) Coniferous swamps\nare capable of\ntranspiring large quantities of water over a major portion of the year. This\nprocess may, during the summer, contribute to the maintenance of low soil and\nwater temperatures critical to the survival of cold water fish in streams fed\nby or running through such swamps. 4\n(i) Wet meadows, when associated\nwith other covertypes, are valuable for wildlife, including nesting by wetland\nbirds. When associated with open water and certain other wetland covertypes, wet meadows may also be valuable for fish spawning. When not associated with\nother wetland covertypes, however, wet meadow is likely to be of relatively\nlower value. 4\n(j) Artificial mudflats\nusually have\nlimited or no values for fish and wildlife due to the unpredictability and\nusually prolonged duration of exposure. 4\n\nWetlands Related to Surface Water\n\nSystems\n(k) Wetlands associated with open\nwater\nprovide breeding and spawning areas as well as food and cover\nfor wildlife and fish using the open water. They are an integral part of open\nwater ecosystems and provide natural nutrient exchange. They purify water\nentering the open water and may improve its quality whether measured in rate of\nflow, dissolved oxygen content, clarity, or ionic content. They often provide\ntemporary storm water storage and ameliorate downstream flooding. Wetlands with over 20 acres within the mean high water mark of lakes, ponds, rivers and streams\nare integral parts of those water bodies and\ncan dramatically affect quality and flow in those waterbodies and are rated\nhighest (1). Wetlands with under two acres in size or not within the\nmean high water mark\nare of much less importance to the adjoining\nwater body and are rated lower (3). 2\n(l) Wetlands that are not part of permanent\nsurface water systems\nhave lower hydrological value and are less\nsupportive of fish and waterfowl. 4\n\nWetlands with Values due to Productivity or\n\nDiversity\n(m) Wetlands with unusual species abundance\nor diversity\nare unique ecosystems which may contain large heron\nrookeries, may be the site of other colonial nesting grounds, may be used\nintensively by migrating birds, or may contain some other abundance or\ndiversity of wildlife or fish. They are relatively more valuable if they are\nunique or exemplary compared to other wetlands in the State, in the\n\nAdirondacks, or in the county in which they are located, and are rated highest\n(1). 2\n(n) Wetlands with a total alkalinity of at\nleast 50 ppm\nare valuable for fish and wildlife since their buffering\ncapacity promotes conditions favorable to the growth of vegetation, providing\ngood wildlife habitat. Alkalinity also indicates natural fertility of the\nunderlying substrate, with potentially high productivity and nutrient\nturnover. 3\n(o) Wetlands adjacent to fertile\nupland, indicated by the presence of growing crops or soils suitable\nfor growing crops in the immediate vicinity, are valuable as fish and wildlife\nhabitat due to higher levels of available plant and nutrients and trace\nelements reaching the wetland. 3\n\nWetlands with Values due to Presence of\n\nThreatened or Endangered Species\n(p) Wetlands with significant evidence of use\nas key habitat for endangered or threatened wildlife species\ncontribute significantly to the survival prospects for that species. Wetlands\nproviding resident habitat for a species considered endangered or threatened in\n\nNew York State or the Adirondack Park are the most critical. Wetlands providing\nmigratory habitat, while also essential for perpetuation of the species, are\nrated lower (2). 1\n(q) Wetlands containing an endangered or\nthreatened plant species\nsimilarly contribute to the prospects for\nsurvival of such species. If five or fewer sites are known where the plant\noccurs within New York State or the Adirondack Park, the wetland provides\nvirtually irreplaceable habitat. Wetlands providing any habitat supporting\nplants endangered or threatened in New York State or the Adirondack Park are\nnevertheless valuable (2). 1\n\nWetlands with Values Due to Geological\n\nFeatures\n(r) Wetlands containing, owing their\nexistence to, or ecologically associated with high quality or \"textbook\nexamples\" of geological features\nare generally of scientific and\neducational interest. 3\n(s) Wetlands with slopes greater than one\npercent\nhave little hydrologic value due to decreased water\nretention. 4\n\nWetlands with Values due to Social\n\nFactors\n(t) Wetlands located in towns where wetlands\nor wetlands of the same covertype are one percent or less of total\nacreage\nare valuable due to comparative rarity. 2\n(u) Wetlands that are among the three largest\nin\nthe town in which located are assigned high values due to\ncomparative rarity. Wetlands among the three largest of the same covertype are\nvaluable for the same reason (3). 2\n(v) Wetlands with island(s) present\nwithin their boundaries provide nesting and refuge for wildlife, visual variety\nand interest, and an opportunity for recreational or educational\nactivities. 3\n(w) Wetlands of demonstrable historical, archeological or paleontological significance\nare generally of high\nvalue for scientists and laymen alike depending upon the specific historic\nevent, or archeological or paleontological feature involved. 3\n(x) Wetlands that contribute significantly to\nopen space or aesthetic values in a hamlet, moderate intensity or low intensity\nuse area\nserve to preserve open space and aesthetic values in areas\nwhere most growth will and should occur according to the Adirondack Park land\nuse and development plan map. They often provide welcome visual relief due to\ntheir natural character, and opportunities for wildlife viewing within built-up\nareas. 3\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
