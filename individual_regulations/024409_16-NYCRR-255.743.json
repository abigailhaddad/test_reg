Tit. 16 § 255.743 - Pressure-limiting and -regulating stations: testing relief device\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Overpressure\nprotection devices shall be tested in place annually to determine if they are\nin proper working condition. They are to be subjected to such maintenance and\noverhaul as may be indicated by said tests. Overpressure protection devices\nused solely for the protection of \"fuel piping\" as, for example, to compressors\nat the compressor stations, shall be tested and inspected in like\nmanner. (b) Nonworking monitoring\nregulator equipment shall be subject to an annual performance test and shall be\ninternally inspected and overhauled if so required by the results of the\ntest. (c) An annual review of the\nrequired capacity of the relieving equipment at each station shall be made and\nthese required capacities compared with the calculated or experimentally\ndetermined recorded relieving capacity of the installed equipment for the\noperating conditions under which it works. (d) If the relieving equipment is of\ninsufficient capacity, a new or additional device shall be installed to provide\nthe additional capacity required or the station regulator capacity reduced\ncommensurate with the existing relief capacity.
