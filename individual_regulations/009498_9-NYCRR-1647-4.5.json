  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1647-4.5 - Accumulation of reserve\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\namount set aside for replacement reserves at the end of each calendar quarter\nand credited to account 2510, Replacement Reserve, shall be equal to one\nquarter of the annual provision for the given year scheduled to be made as per\n\nTable II of the schedule of replacement reserve requirements (see § 1647-\n4.3, subd. [b]). No deduction shall be made from the quarterly provision for\ncharges for replacements incurred during the quarter. Interest on investments\nof reserves shall be accrued and recorded separately in account 2511, Interest\n\nEarned on Reserve Fund Investments (see §\n1647-4.3, subd. [c])\n(b) Provisions for replacements are based on\neither of two methods of accumulation, as follows: (1)\n\nInterest savings method. In this method\nthe annual contributions, previously determined, are based on the savings in\ninterest charges on the indebtedness of the local agency to the State of New\n\nYork arising out of the periodical reductions, by way of amortization, of that\nindebtedness in accordance with the terms of the loan contract. This saving is\nthe difference between the amount charged, on the accrual basis, to account\n4716, Interest on Indebtedness, for a given fiscal year and the amount of the\nannual interest charge on the original indebtedness. The annual provision, under this method, will ordinarily, be equal to the interest saving for the\nyear, but is subject to adjustment at the direction of the division, or with\nits prior authorization and approval, as a result of the periodical review of\nthe adequacy of the reserve. The interest savings method results in a level\nmaximum rent charge, particularly during the early years of operation, but has\nthe disadvantage of being only incidentally related to the replacement\nrequirements. It cannot be used if the interest rate is too low. (2)\n\nSinking fund method. In this method, the\nannual contributions, previously determined, are based on an analysis of the\nlife expectancies of the various classes of assets to be replaced over the\nstatutory life of the project, as described in subdivision (b) of section\n1647-4.3. The annual provision, under this method, is also subject to adjustment at the direction of the\ndivision, or with its prior authorization and approval, as a result of the\nperiodical review of the adequacy of the reserve. The sinking fund method\nresults in higher initial rent charges which may later be offset by interest\nsavings, but has the advantage of being directly related to the replacement\nrequirements. (c) The\nlocal agency will be advised by the division as to which method of accumulating\nreserves will be applicable to a particular project. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1647-4.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
