Tit. 20 § 361.1 - Releases of liens\n\nState Regulations\n\nUnder articles 10, 10-C and 26 of the Tax Law, the State\n\nTax Commission is authorized to issue releases of liens imposed by said\narticles on real property of decedents. Such releases will be issued, upon\napplication therefor, in accordance with the following rules: (a) Where an order has been entered exempting\nan estate from the taxes imposed by article 10, 10-C or 26, a release will be\nissued for any real property disclosed in the proceeding. (b) Where an order has been entered assessing\na tax under article 10, 10-C or 26, a release will be issued for any real\nproperty set forth in the return of the estate, provided the tax which is a\nlien on such real property, together with interest thereon, is paid. (c) Where a proceeding to assess a tax under\narticle 10, 10-C or 26 is pending at the time of the application, and an\nadequate estimated payment on account of the tax has been made, a release will\nbe issued. (d) Where no order\nfixing the tax or exempting the estate has been entered, no proceeding is\npending and no estimated tax paid under article 10, 10-C or 26, the following\nprocedure should be followed: (1)\n\nWhere the\napplication is made by the executor, administrator, trustee, or beneficiary of\nan estate, the application must be accompanied by an affidavit setting forth\nthe date of decedent's death, all the decedent's property subject to tax, the\nallowable deductions, the persons interested in the estate and the amount of\nthe distributive share of each beneficiary. If it appears from such affidavit\nthat no tax is due, a release will be promptly issued but if it appears\ntherefrom that a tax is due, it must be paid before a release will be\nissued. (2)\n\nWhere the application\nis made by any other person, it must be accompanied by an affidavit setting\nforth the relationship, directly or indirectly, of the applicant to the\ndecedent and to any person interested in the estate, and the reason the\napplicant seeks the release. Such affidavit shall also set forth the date of\nthe decedent's death, all of decedent's property subject to tax, the allowable\ndeductions, the persons interested in the estate and the amount of the\ndistributive share of each beneficiary.

The affidavit should also outline the proceedings, if any, in the\n\nSurrogate's Court in regard to the decedent's estate, the assessed value of the\nreal property for which a release is sought, (i) at the time of decedent's\ndeath, and (ii) as shown on the last preceding assessment roll, and the names\nof owners of such real property after the decedent's death, so far as they\nappear upon the public records. A release will be issued dependent upon the\nfacts in each case upon such conditions as will not jeopardize the revenues of\nthe State. (e) Each\napplication for a release must be accompanied by the statutory fee of $2 with\nrespect to article 10, and $10 with respect to articles 10-C and 26, made\npayable to the State Tax Commission, and: (1)\nwhere acceptable to the clerk of the county in which the real property is\nsituated, the section, block, and lot numbers, and/or the book of deeds or\nliber number (including the page number), tax map number (where applicable), and the complete address of the property; or\n(2)\nin those counties where the information\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision is not acceptable, the legal description\n(metes and bounds) of the real property, in duplicate.
