  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 598.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Physical and\nbehavioral health conditions (\ni.e., mental illness and/or\nsubstance use disorders) often occur at the same time. Persons with behavioral\ndisorders frequently experience chronic illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. These illnesses can be prevented\nand are treatable. However, barriers to primary care, as well as the difficulty\nin navigating complex healthcare systems, are a major obstacle to individuals\nwith behavioral health disorders seeking treatment for their physical\nconditions. (b) Primary care\nsettings have, at the same time, become a gateway to the behavioral health\nsystem, as people seek care for mild to moderate behavioral health needs\n(\ne.g., anxiety, depression, or substance use) in primary\nhealth care settings. Health care providers have long recognized that many\npatients have both physical and behavioral health care needs, yet physical and\nbehavioral health care services have traditionally been provided and paid for\nseparately. Even behavioral health services have traditionally been treated in\na bifurcated system (\ne.g., substance use disorder treatment is\ntreated separately from mental health treatment). (c) The term\nintegrated care\ndescribes the systematic coordination of primary and behavioral health\ncare services. The growing awareness of the prevalence and cost of comorbid\nphysical and behavioral health conditions, and the increased recognition that\nintegrated care can improve outcomes and achieve savings, has led to increasing\nacceptance of delivery models that integrate physical and behavioral health\ncare. Moreover, most patients prefer to have their physical and behavioral\nhealth care delivered in one place, by the same team of clinicians. (d) Accordingly, these regulations will\nprescribe standards for the integration of physical and behavioral health care\nservices in certain outpatient programs licensed by the Department of Health, the Office of Mental Health, and/or the Office of Alcoholism and Substance\n\nAbuse Services. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 14\n§\n598.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
