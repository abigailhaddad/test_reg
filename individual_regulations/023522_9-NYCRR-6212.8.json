  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6212.8 - Record processing during conversion and maintenance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The county\nboard shall adopt, and ensure compliance with, procedures to guarantee the\nsecurity and integrity of registration poll records during conversion and\nmaintenance. A copy of these procedures shall be filed with the State Board at\ntime of making application for discontinuance of registration poll records (see\nsection\n6212.12\n[a]\nof this\n\nPart.)\n(b) When such documents are\nremoved from ledgers, they shall be maintained and processed in uniquely\nidentified batches. Each batch and each document therein shall be accounted for\nthrough use of logs which record every processing transaction in which it is\ninvolved, from the time of removal from the ledger until returned to the\nledger. For each transaction the log shall indicate the action taken, date, time and by whom. (c) Any of the\nfollowing may be used as a source document for a voter signature image: (1)\n\nThe original registration poll record or\na replacement registration poll record created because the preceding one was\nfilled to capacity. A signature appearing either on the front or on the back of\na registration poll record may serve as the basis for the computer\nimage. (2)\n\nAny other original voter\nregistration record including school board registration, military registration, special Federal registration, change of name registration and Federal Post Card\n\nApplication (FPCA). (3)\n\nAbsentee\nvoting application. (4)\n\nAbsentee\nballot envelope. (5)\n\nAffidavit\nballot envelope. (6)\n\nRegistration\npoll list or the challenge report used in connection with that list. (7)\n\nSpecial form, card, or letter mailed to a\nvoter for the purpose of obtaining a signature. (d) Standards for quality of the signature\nimage and facsimile shall be established by the board and applied by staff in\nproducing the signature image for the file. Such standards shall include, but\nnot be limited to, provisions to assure: (1)\nthat the image produced for a particular voter's registration record is the\nsignature of the voter; (2)\nthat\nthe image is properly positioned; and\n(3)\nthat the quality of the image on the\nscreen is such that a hard copy facsimile generated from it will enable an\nelection inspector to make a comparison between the facsimile and the signature\nthe voter signs on election day. (e) If, in the judgment of the board, the\nquality and usefulness of a signature image in the file can be improved by\nsubstituting therefor one created from a different signature of the same voter, that substitution may be made. (f) All records in the computer registration files shall be verified by the local\nboard before they are used to generate a registration poll list. That\nverification process shall include at least the following: (1)\nconfirmation that every eligible voter is\non the file; and\n(2)\nconfirmation\nthat the signature facsimile included in each record is the correct signature\nfor that voter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n6212.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
