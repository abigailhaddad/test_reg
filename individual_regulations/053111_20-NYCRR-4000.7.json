  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 4000.7 - Miscellaneous provisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Service and filing of documents. (1)\n(i) All requests and other documents served\non, or filed with, the Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services shall be\nmade either by delivery in person during business hours to its Albany offices, or by mail properly addressed to such offices. (ii)\n\nIn general and except as otherwise\nprovided for in this Chapter or the Tax Law, where any document required to be\nserved or filed within a prescribed period or on or before a prescribed date\nunder the authority of section 170.3 -a of article 8 of the Tax Law is, after\nsuch period or date, delivered by United States mail to the appropriate address\nof the Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services, the date of the United\n\nStates postmark as stamped on the envelope or other wrapper in which such\ndocument is contained will be deemed to be the date of service or filing. A\nsimilar rule applies with respect to certain designated delivery services. See\nsection\n2399.2\n(a)(1)\nof this Title. Where delivery is made by courier, delivery messenger or similar\nservice that is not a designated delivery service, the date of receipt by the\n\nBureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services will be deemed to be the date of\nservice or filing. (iii)\n\nIn\naddition to the methods prescribed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, requests for a conciliation conference may also be filed with the Bureau of\n\nConciliation and Mediation Services in any other manner as prescribed by the\ndepartment. (2)\n\nMailing\nrequirements. Any document which is not received by the Bureau of Conciliation\nand Mediation Services within the prescribed period or on or before the\nprescribed date will not be considered to be timely served or timely filed\nunless it is mailed in accordance with all of the following requirements: (i) The document must be contained in an\nenvelope or other appropriate wrapper properly addressed to the Bureau of\n\nConciliation and Mediation Services at the address designated by the Department\nof Taxation and Finance. (ii)\n\nThe\nenvelope or wrapper containing the document must be deposited in the mail of\nthe United States within the prescribed period or on or before the prescribed\ndate with sufficient postage prepaid. For this purpose, such document is\nconsidered to be deposited in the mail of the United States when it is\ndeposited with the domestic mail service of the United States Postal Service. The domestic mail service of the United States Postal Service includes mail\ntransmitted within, among, and between the United States, its territories and\npossessions, and Army - Air Force (APO) and Navy (FPO) post offices. (iii)\n(a) If the postmark on the envelope or wrapper containing the document is made by\nthe United States Postal Service, such postmark must bear a date stamped by the\n\nUnited States Postal Service which is within the prescribed period or on or\nbefore the prescribed date for service or filing. If the postmark stamped by\nthe United States Postal Service on the envelope or wrapper does not bear a\ndate which falls within such prescribed period or on or before such prescribed\ndate for service or filing, the document will not be considered to be timely\nserved or filed, regardless of when the envelope or wrapper was deposited in\nthe mail. Accordingly, the sender assumes the risk that the envelope or wrapper\nwill bear a postmark date stamped by the United States Postal Service within\nthe prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date for service or\nfiling, but see paragraph (3) of this subdivision with respect to the use of\nregistered mail or certified mail to avoid this risk. Furthermore, if the\npostmark made by the United States Postal Service on the envelope or wrapper\ncontaining the document is not legible, the provisions of clause (c) of this\nsubparagraph shall apply, unless the person who or which is required to serve\nor file the document can prove when the postmark was impressed by the United\n\nStates Postal Service. (b) (1)\n\nIf the postmark on the envelope or\nwrapper containing the document is made by other than the United States Postal\n\nService (i.e., metered mail); (i) the\npostmark so made must bear a date which falls within the prescribed period or\non or before the prescribed date for service or filing of the document; and\n(ii)\nthe document must be\nreceived by the Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services not later than\nthe time when an envelope or other appropriate wrapper which has sufficient\npostage prepaid and is properly addressed, mailed and sent by the same class of\nmail would ordinarily be received at the address designated by the department\nif it were postmarked at the same point of origin by the United States Postal\n\nService on the last day of such prescribed period or on the prescribed date for\nservice or filing. (2)\n\nIn a case where the document is received after the time when a document so\nmailed and so postmarked by the United States Postal Service would ordinarily\nbe received at the address designated by the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance, such document will be treated as having been received at a time when a\ndocument so mailed and postmarked would ordinarily have been received, if the\nperson who or which is required to serve or file the document establishes: (i) that it was actually deposited in the\nmail before the last collection of the mail from the place of deposit which was\npostmarked (except for metered mail) by the United States Postal Service within\nthe prescribed period or on or before the prescribed date of service or\nfiling; (ii)\nthat the delay in\nreceiving the document was due to a delay in the transmission of the mail; and\n(iii)\nthe cause of such\ndelay. (3)\n\nIf the\nenvelope or wrapper containing the document has a postmark made by the United\n\nStates Postal Service in addition to the postmark not so made, the postmark\nwhich was not made by the United States Postal Service will be disregarded, and\nwhether the envelope or wrapper was mailed in accordance with this subdivision\nwill be determined solely by approving the provisions of clause (a) of this\nsubparagraph. (c) If the\nenvelope or wrapper containing the document bears sufficient prepaid United\n\nStates postage but is missing any postmark whatsoever, the document must be\nreceived by the Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services not later than\nthe time when an envelope or wrapper which has sufficient postage prepaid and\nis properly addressed, mailed and sent by the same class of mail would\nordinarily be received at he address designated by the department if it were\npostmarked at the same point of orgin by the United States Postal Service on\nthe last day of such prescribed period or on the prescribed date of service or\nfiling. In a case where the document is received after such time, the\nprovisions of clause (b) (2) of this subparagraph shall apply. (3)\n(i) If an envelope or wrapper containing a\ndocument is sent by United States registered mail, the date of such\nregistration is treated as the postmark date and the date of service or\nfiling. (ii)\n\nIf an envelope or\nwrapper containing a document is sent by United States certified mail and the\nsender's receipt for certified mail is postmarked by the postal employee to\nwhom such envelope or wrapper is presented, the date of the postmark on such\nreceipt for certified mail is treated as the postmark date and the date of\nservice or filing. (4)\n\nIf the envelope or wrapper containing the document is mailed in a foreign\ncountry, the date of receipt of the envelope or wrapper by the Bureau of\n\nConciliation and Mediation Services will be deemed to be in the date of service\nor filing. (5)\n\nThe term document, as used in this subdivision, means any request for a conciliation conference or\nother paper required to be served or filed within a prescribed period or on or\nbefore a prescribed date under the authority of any provision of section 170.3\n-a of article 8 of the Tax Law. See Part 3000 of this Title for service and\nfiling of documents with the Division of Tax Appeals. (6)\n\nService of documents on parties by the\n\nBureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services can be made in the same manner\nand the same rules regarding date of service or filing as set forth in this\nsection shall apply. Service of conciliation orders shall be made by registered\nor certified mail. (b) Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. For purposes of section 170.3 -a of\narticle 8 of the Tax Law, when the last day prescribed for service or filing of\na document or performing any act falls on a Saturday, Sunday or a day which is\na legal holiday in the State of New York, the performance of such acts will be\nconsidered timely if performed on the next succeeding day which is not a\n\nSaturday, Sunday or legal holiday. (c) Extension of time. The Bureau of\n\nConciliation and Mediation Services may, on its own or at the request of any\nparty, grant a continuance, extension of time or adjournment for good cause, provided no statutory prohibition exists.
