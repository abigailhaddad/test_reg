(5)\n\"CTDI\n100\n\" is the dose measurement made with a 16cm diameter (head/pediatric body) or a 32cm diameter (body) acrylic phantom. The measurements are made utilizing a 100mm long pencil ionization chamber. Readings are made with the ion chamber in both the center (axial or central dose) position and near surface slots of the phantom (the peripheral dose). (6)\n\"CTDI\nw\n\", the weighted or blended dose, is calculated by adding together two-thirds of the CTDI\n100\nperipheral dose with one-third of the CTDI100 axial or center dose. (CTDI\nw\n= 2/3 CTDI\n100\nperipheral + 1/3 CTDI\n100\naxial or center). CTDIw represents an average dose in the x and y planes. (7)\n\"CTDI\nvol\n\" represents the integrated dose over the total volume that is irradiated, CTDI\nvol\n= (1/PITCH) x (CTDI\nw\n), where \"Pitch\" is defined as the table travel per rotation divided by the collimation of the x-ray beam. CTDI\nvol\nrepresents the average dose in the x, y and z planes. (8)\n\"CT conditions of operation\" means all selectable parameters governing the operation of a CT x-ray system including nominal tomographic section thickness, filtration, and the technique factors. (9)\n\"CT dosimetry phantom\" means the phantom used for determination of the dose delivered by a CT x-ray system.

The phantom shall be at least 14 centimeters in length and shall have diameters of 32.0 centimeters for testing any CT system designed to image any section of the body (whole body scanners) and 16.0 centimeters for any system designed to image the head (head scanners) or for any whole body scanner operated in the head scanning mode. The phantom shall provide means for the placement of a dosimeter(s) along its axis of rotation and along a line parallel to the axis of rotation 1.0 centimeter from the outer surface and within the phantom. (10)\n\"Dose length product\" (DLP) is defined as the CTDI\nvol\ntimes the irradiated length of the body for the whole series of images that are taken during a CT scan. (11)\n\"Picture Archiving and Communication System (PACS)\" is a medical imaging technology that provides access to and storage for medical images from multiple modalities. It is comprised of an image acquisition system, display, network and data storage or archiving system. (12)\n\"Reference plane\" means a plane which is displaced from and parallel to the tomographic plane. (13)\n\"Scan\" means the complete process of collecting x-ray transmission data for the production of a tomogram or a series of tomograms. (14)\n\"Scan increment\" means the amount of relative displacement of the patient with respect to the CT x-ray system between successive scans measured along the direction of such displacement. (15)\n\"Technique\" means the settings selected on the control panel of the equipment and may include the position of the x-ray tube, image intensifier and patient.

(f) Operating Procedures and Policies\n(1)\n\nThe CT x-ray system shall not be operated on a human being except by a physician or by a radiologic technologist licensed pursuant to Article 35 of the Public Health Law who has been specifically trained in its operation. (2)\n\nThe registrant shall ensure that each CT x-ray system has a radiation protection survey or other measurement and assessment of exposure to persons in controlled and non-controlled areas made at the time of installation. Additional radiation protection surveys shall be done after any change in the radiation installation or equipment which might cause a significant increase in radiation hazard. (3)\n\nEach CT x-ray system shall have available at the control panel written information regarding the operation and calibration of the CT x-ray system. Such information shall include: (i) Dates of the latest calibration and QC checks and the location within the facility where the results of those tests may be obtained; (ii)\n\nInstructions on the use of the CT dosimetry phantom(s) including a schedule of QC tests that are appropriate for the system as determined by the manufacturer, allowable variations for the indicated parameters, and the results of at least the most recent spot checks conducted on the system; (iii)\nA current set of default protocols are available at the control panel (either electronically or as a document) which specifies for each routine examination the CT conditions of operation and the slice thickness, spacing between slices and/or pitch; (iv)\nA list of techniques optimized for the body part being imaged to obtain a quality image and to ensure that the lowest amount of radiation is used as consistent with good medical practice. (4)\n\nIf the QC testing on the CT x-ray system identifies that a system operating parameter has exceeded a tolerance as specified in the Quality Assurance manual, use of the CT x-ray system on patients shall be limited to those exceptions permitted by established written instructions of the licensed medical physicist or radiologist. Upon completion of corrective action, the QC testing shall be repeated to verify that the system is back within tolerance. (5)\n\nCommencing one (1) year after the effective date of these regulations, each registrant performing CT scans on human beings shall ensure that for each scan, the radiation dose delivered by the scanner to a reference phantom or the dose received by the patient is saved and recorded. The dose delivered shall be recorded as Computed Tomography Dose Index volume (CTDI\nvol\n), dose length product (DLP) or other dosimetry metric published in the peer reviewed scientific literature and acceptable to the Department. The dose received by a patient shall be recorded as organ dose or other dosimetry metric published in the peer reviewed scientific literature and acceptable to the Department. (6)\n\nThe displayed dose shall be verified on an annual basis by or under the supervision of a licensed medical physicist to ensure that the equipment manufacturer's displayed dose is within 20% of the measured dose. (7)\n\nEighteen months after the effective date of these regulations, each current registrant that performs diagnostic CT scans on human beings shall be accredited by a nationally recognized accreditation program that is acceptable to the Department. A facility performing CT that loses their existing accreditation or a registrant or licensee that fails to obtain accreditation must report this fact within 30 days to the Department. After the effective date of these regulations new licensees or registrants will have 18 months to become accredited, but must demonstrate that they have initiated the accreditation process within 90 days of the start of operations. (8)\n\nEach registrant that performs CT scans on human beings shall establish and implement a policy and a procedure to ensure that: (i) a request for a CT scan originates from a physician or other authorized health care practitioner familiar with the patient's clinical condition; and\n(ii)\nthe request includes sufficient information to demonstrate the medical indication for the CT examination and allow for the proper performance and interpretation of the CT scan.
