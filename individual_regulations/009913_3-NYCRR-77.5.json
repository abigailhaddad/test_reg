  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 77.5 - Letters of credit\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor purposes of sections\n235\n(8-c)\nand\n380-k\nof the\n\nBanking Law, a commercial, corporation or business loan shall be deemed to\ninclude commercial letters of credit and standby letters of credit as a\ncategory of commercial loan transaction so long as they meet the requirements\nof this section. However, all amounts to be drawn under commercial letters of\ncredit and the amounts for which a savings bank or savings and loan association\nmakes a commitment under a standby letter of credit are to be aggregated and\nshall usually be considered unsecured loans. Consequently, they shall be\nsubject to the 15 per centum unsecured loan limit per borrower. The following\nrequirements apply to commercial letters of credit and to standby letters of\ncredit: (a) each letter of credit must\nconspicuously state that it is a letter of credit; (b) the institution's undertaking must\ncontain a specified expiration date or must be for a definite term; (c) the institution's undertaking must be for\na stated and limited amount; (d) the institution's obligation to pay must arise only upon presentation of a\ndraft or other documents as specified in the letter of credit and the\ninstitution must not be called upon to determine questions of fact or law at\nissue between the parties to the underlying transaction; and\n(e) the customer of the institution must have\nan unqualified obligation to reimburse the savings bank or savings and loan\nassociation for payments made under the letter of credit. All amounts representing obligations entered into under\ncommercial or standby letters of credit must be reported to the Board of\n\nTrustees of the savings bank or the Board of Directors of the savings and loan\nassociation in the same manner as set forth for loans in section\n252\nof the Banking\n\nLaw. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n77.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
