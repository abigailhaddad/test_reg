If a county does not adopt a local law or\nordinance within 90 days of the date the official applicable freshwater\nwetlands map is filed by the department, regulatory authority is retained by\nthe department until the county assumes regulatory authority pursuant to the\nact and this Part. The department will remain as the regulatory authority in\nthose areas of the State where no local government has assumed authority and\nduring the time in which a local government is in the process of assuming\npursuant to this section.

He will also identify those areas of concern, as\npracticable, to assist the local government in bringing its local law or\nordinance into compliance. The local government must then bring its law into\ncompliance and resubmit it to the commissioner, pursuant to this subdivision, along with a statement indicating the necessary changes made in the law. The\ncommissioner will then process the loal law pursuant to this\nsubdivision. (f) A local\nlaw or ordinance pursuant to the act cannot be implemented until applicable\nfreshwater wetland maps have been filed by the department.

(2)\n\nWhen the commissioner has determined that\nthe local government does not possess the necessary technical or administrative\ncapability pursuant to the act and this Part, the commissioner will notify the\nlocal government in his written findings, that it has not met the standards of\nconditions stated in the act and this Part.

A local government will be\nafforded an opportunity for a hearing before its jurisdiction is\nsuperseded. (l) A local government\nmay certify in writing that it does not want to assume or retain regulatory\nauthority or that it does not possess the technical capacity or the procedures\nto effectively carry out the requirements of the act and transfer its\njurisdiction to the county or to the department, as the case may be, in\naccordance with section 24-0503 of the act. A village, town or city making such\ncertification must send it by certified mail to the chief executive officer of\nthe county; a county making such certification must send it by certified mail\nto the commissioner. (m) In\naccordance with the procedures outlined in subdivisions (e) and (i) of this\nsection, the department must be notified of changes in the capability of a\nlocal government which would impair its ability to effectively implement the\nact and the provisions of this Part. (n) Any local government that defaults or\ntransfers its jurisdiction or has its jurisdiction superseded, may recover its\nauthority by adopting a local law or ordinance and/or certifying as to its\ntechnical and administrative capability, as the case may be, pursuant to\nsubdivision 24-0501.6 of the act and the provisions of this Part.
