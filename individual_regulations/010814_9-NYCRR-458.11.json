(b) In\nrural districts, the advance distance will depend upon the speed limit, prevailing speed of approaching traffic, character of road alignment and nature\nof the topography. Subject to adjustment for specific conditions, the advanced\ndistance for warning signs shall normally be between 250 feet and 750\nfeet. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
