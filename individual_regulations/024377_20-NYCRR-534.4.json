  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 534.4 - Refunds and credits for omnibus carriers engaged in local transit service\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1119(b)\n(a) Definitions. (1)\n\nOmnibus carrier. For\npurposes of this section, an\nomnibus carrier\nis a carrier that\nprovides local transit service in this State and that operates pursuant to a\ncertificate of public convenience and necessity issued by the Commissioner of\n\nTransportation of this State or by a like officer or agency of the United\n\nStates or pursuant to a contract, franchise, or consent between the carrier and\na city in this State having a population of more than one million inhabitants, or any agency of such city. (2)\n\nOmnibus. For purposes of this section, an\nomnibus\nis a motor vehicle with a seating capacity of more\nthan seven passengers used for the transportation of passengers for hire. Such\nterm does not include a taxicab. (3)\n\nLocal transit service. For the purposes of this section, local transit service\nmeans\na mass transit service (as distinguished from a charter, contract, school bus, sight-seeing or other service) provided by an omnibus carrier in which\npassengers are carried by omnibuses from one point in this State to another\npoint in this State and in performance of which the omnibuses either: (i) regularly pick up or discharge passengers\nat their convenience or at bus stops on the street or highway, as distinguished\nfrom buildings or facilities used for bus terminals or stations; or\n(ii)\npick up and discharge passengers at bus\nterminals or stations, the distance between which is not more than 75 miles, measured along the route traveled by the bus. Example 1: Buses of the X Company operate, pursuant to a certificate\nof convenience and necessity from the Commissioner of Transportation, from a\nterminal in the city of A to a station in the city of B, proceed to a station\nin the city of C and continue to a terminal in the city of D. All of the cities\nand all of the mileage are within the State of New York. The distance along the\nroute traveled from A to B is 80 miles, from B to C is 80 miles and from C to D\nis 60 miles. Between A and B these buses pick up and discharge passengers at\nstops along the highway, but they do not do this between B and C and C and D. Between A and B and C and D these buses are operated in local transit service, but not between B and C. Example 2: Buses of the Y Company operate from a terminal in A, a city\nwithin the State of New York, to a terminal in B, a city outside the State of\n\nNew York. Between the terminal in A and the State boundary, the buses do not\npick up or discharge any passengers. These buses are not being operated in\nlocal transit service because they are not carrying passengers from one point\nin this State to another point in this State. Example 3: Buses of the Z Company operate from a terminal in A to a\nstation in B and proceed to a terminal in C. Cities A and C are in New York\n\nState and city B is outside of New York State. The distance between each of the\ncities along the route traveled is 20 miles. The company carries passengers\nfrom city A to cities B and C. The buses will be considered as operating in\nlocal transit service since the total distance between points A and C is less\nthan 75 miles, even though the distance from A to C includes some mileage\noutside of the State. Example 4: Assume the facts in example 3, except that the distance\nbetween each of the cities is 40 miles. The buses will not be considered as\noperating in local transit service, since the total distance between points A\nand C is greater than 75 miles. The fact that the company carries passengers\nfrom city A to city B, a distance of 40 miles does not qualify such carriage as\na local transit service because it is not between two points within the State\nof New York. (4)\n\nVehicle mileage. Vehicle mileage\nmeans the\nnumber of miles run by all omnibuses operated by a carrier in the performance\nof local transit service plus the number of idle miles run to the point at\nwhich service begins and from the point at which such service terminates. Such\nmileage includes only miles operated within New York State. (5)\n\nTotal mileage operated. Total mileage operated\nincludes the vehicle mileage computed\nin paragraph (4) of this subdivision, plus the number of miles operated in\ncharter service, school contract service, other contract service, excursion\nservice, sight-seeing service, and all other passenger service which is not\nincluded within the meaning of vehicle mileage. Such mileage includes only\nmiles operated within New York State. (6)\n\nLocal transit service percentage. (i) The\nlocal transit service\npercentage\nis the proportion that the carrier's vehicle mileage\noperated in local transit service, as defined in paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision, bears to the carrier's total mileage operated in this State, as\ndefined in paragraph (5) of this subdivision, for the calendar year immediately\npreceding the end of the quarterly return period to which such refund or credit\nrelates. (ii)\n\nSpecial computation\nfor the first four quarterly returns of an omnibus carrier not engaged in local\ntransit service in the preceding calendar year. Such a carrier shall compute\nthe local transit service percentage by determining the proportion that the\nvehicle mileage operated in local transit service in this State in the first\nthree months of operation bears to the total mileage operated in this State in\nsuch period. Example 5: Under the facts of Example 3 set forth in paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision, omnibus carrier Z operates its buses for 65,000 miles. Of\nthis number of miles, 17,500 miles are between the terminal in city A and the\nstation in city B, of which 1,000 miles are operated outside of New York State. 17,500 miles are operated between the station in city B and the terminal in\ncity C, of which 4,000 miles are operated outside of the State. 15,000 miles\nare operated in school bus contract service in New York State and 15,000 miles\nare operated in charter service in New York State. Vehicle mileage consists of\n30,000 miles which is composed of the 16,500 miles traveled in New York State\nbetween cities A and B and the 13,500 miles traveled in New York State between\ncities B and C. Total mileage consists of 60,000 miles which is all of the\nmiles operated except the 5,000 miles operated out of the State. The local\ntransit service percentage is 50 percent (the percentage that 30,000 miles\nbears to 60,000 miles). (b) Allowability of refund or credit of\ntax paid. (1)\n\nAn omnibus carrier\nengaged in local transit service is allowed a refund or credit of tax paid with\nrespect to the purchase, lease, or use of an omnibus. (2)\n(i) An\nomnibus carrier engaged in local transit service is allowed a refund or credit\nof tax paid with respect to its purchase or use of motor fuel or diesel motor\nfuel, parts, equipment (including supplies) actually used or consumed only on\nor in omnibuses and with respect to its purchase of maintenance services or\nrepairs actually performed on an omnibus. (ii)\n\nThe following lists of equipment and\nsupplies are intended to indicate the scope of items applicable to omnibus\ncarriers covered by section\n1119 (b)\nof the Tax Law. These lists are not all inclusive. (a) Items\nof equipment, and of supplies that are eligible for refund or credit of tax\npaid are: (1)\ngrease, lubricating oils and\nfluids, and anti-freeze; (2)\nfirst\naid kits; (3)\nfire\nextinguishers; (4)\nfare boxes; and\n(5)\nsanitary supplies and\nchemicals, provided such items are actually used or consumed only on\nor in omnibuses. (b) Items of equipment, and of supplies that\nare not eligible for refund or credit of tax paid are: (1)\nrepair trucks and supervisory vehicles, and fuel; parts, and lubricants used in the operation, maintenance and repair\nof such vehicles; (2)\ntools and\nequipment used in garages; (3)\noffice, terminal and station equipment, furniture and fixtures; (4)\nlog books; and\n(5)\ntickets. (iii)\n\nIf parts, equipment, or fuel are\npurchased and placed in inventory, a refund or credit will be allowed for the\nquarter in which purchased if they are actually used or consumed on omnibuses\nin such quarter, or if a statement is furnished by the carrier that such items\nwill actually be used or consumed only on or in omnibuses. Example 6: An omnibus carrier purchases log books, desks, and chairs\nfor a waiting room, 20,000 gallons of motor fuel, 20 carburetors, and is\ncharged by a local garage for 200 hours of service. Omnibuses of the carrier\nuse 15,000 gallons of motor fuel, require 15 carburetors, and 150 hours of\nservice time. Repair vehicles use 3,000 gallons of motor fuel, require 3\ncarburetors and 30 hours of service time. Supervisors' cars require 2,000\ngallons of motor fuel, 2 carburetors and 20 hours of service time. The only\npurchases eligible for a refund or credit are those actually used on or\nconsumed in the operation or repair of the omnibus itself. Accordingly, only\nthe cost of 15,000 gallons of motor fuel, 15 carburetors and 150 hours of\nservice time is eligible for refund or credit of tax paid. The cost of the\nremaining motor fuel, carburetors, hours of service time, log books, desks and\nchairs is not eligible. (c) Determination of amount of refund\nor credit. The refund or credit is determined in accordance with the\nfollowing table: If the local transit service percentage\nis: The refund or credit\nis: Less than 10 percent\n\nNone\n10 percent\n10 percent of the combined State and local taxes\npaid\n\nGreater than 10 percent but less then 70 percent\n10 percent plus the product of 1.5 times each whole\npercent in excess of 10 percent of the combined State and local taxes paid\n70 percent or more\n100 percent of the combined State and local taxes\npaid\n\nExample 7: Under the facts of example 5, set forth in paragraph (6) of\nsubdivision (a) of this section, it was determined that the local transit\nservice percentage of omnibus carrier Z is 50 percent. Omnibus carrier Z is\nentitled to a refund of 70 percent of the tax paid on items eligible for such\nrefund or credit, computed as follows: initial 10%\n= 10% +\n40% × 1.5\n=\n60%\nTotal\n70%\n(d) Application for credit or refund. An application for refund or credit must be filed with the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance and must cover a period of not less than\nthree months. (For the administrative provisions on applying for credit or\nrefund, see section\n534.2\nof this Part.)\n(e) Records to be maintained. (1)\n\nAn\nomnibus carrier must maintain records relating to its purchases or rentals of\nall omnibuses, parts, equipment (including supplies), motor fuel or diesel\nmotor fuel, maintenance services or repairs, purchased and used in the\noperation of its omnibuses which disclose: (i) the vendor's name; (ii)\nthe invoice number; (iii)\nthe invoice date; (iv)\nthe amount of the purchase; (v) the amount of the sales tax paid on the\ninvoice; and\n(vi)\na brief\ndescription of the item(s) purchased. (2)\n\nAn omnibus carrier must maintain records\nwhich disclose: (i) vehicle mileage operated\nin local transit service in this State; (ii)\nnumber of miles operated in the State\nthat qualify as charter service, school contract service, excursion service, sight-seeing service, and other passenger service not included within the\nmeaning of vehicle mileage in local transit service; and\n(iii)\ntotal mileage operated within the\n\nState.
