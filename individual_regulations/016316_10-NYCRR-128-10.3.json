Tit. 10 §§ 128-10.3 - Tests for analytical determination of concentrations of elements\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following tests and methods are used by the department in assessing the impacts of a regulated activity on a reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake. An applicant may conduct sampling in waters owned by the city as set forth herein with prior authorization by the department. (a) Collection of samples and assessment of impacts. (1)\n\nIn conducting tests or making analytical determinations to ascertain conformity or nonconformity with the standards set forth in Subpart 128-4 of this Part, samples should be collected from locations which are representative of the general quality of water in the watercourse, reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake. (2)\n\nIn assessing the impact of a proposed regulated activity on a watercourse, reservoir, reservoir stem, or controlled lake, or in determining compliance with the standards set forth in Subpart 128-4 of this Part, the department will examine the impacts of the proposed activity throughout the year and the impacts on the photic, metalimnion and hypolimnion zones of the reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake. (3)\n\nImpacts on reservoirs will be determined on the basis of samples taken on a schedule which is sufficient to reflect temporal variability and to meet regulatory requirements. (4)\n\nSampling locations in reservoirs will include: dams, intakes, mid-pool stations, and main tributaries into each reservoir. At every station, an integrated sample of the photic zone shall be taken. At deeper stations, samples will be collected from the metatimnion and hypolimnion. (5)\n\nReservoir stem samples should be collected in the section of the reservoir stem that is free-flowing and unimpeded by the reservoir when the impoundment is at full pool elevation. (b) Tests and analytical determinations. Tests or analytical determinations to determine compliance or noncompliance with the water quality standards in Subpart 128-4 of this Part should be made in accordance with: (1)\n\nStandard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 12th edition, 1965, Table 18, Qualitative Description of Odors, page 306.
