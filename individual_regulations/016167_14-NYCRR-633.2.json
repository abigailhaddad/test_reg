  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 633.2 - Intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To set forth\nspecific minimum requirements and standards for ensuring and/or promoting the\nprotection of the people served, with developmental disabilities, with which\nfacilities operated or certified by OPWDD shall comply. (b) To provide the basis to agencies whereby\nthey shall develop and implement written agency/facility (see glossary)\nspecific policies/procedures (see glossary), which reflect compliance with this\n\nPart. Such policies/procedures shall become part of the agency/facility policy\nand/ or procedure manual(s). Upon development, such policies/procedures shall\nbe implemented and the agency/facility shall be responsible for ensuring\nongoing compliance with said policies/ procedures. (c) In reviewing the continued eligibility of\na facility for an operating certificate, OPWDD shall survey for compliance with\nall standards of certification (see glossary) herein and any other regulatory\nrequirements applicable to that class of operating certificate. OPWDD may make\ninquiries into and evaluate evidence of noncompliance with the principles of\ncompliance (see glossary) applicable to the class of operating certificate. (1)\n\nPrinciples of compliance set forth the\nbasic conditions for the operation of a facility. Principles of compliance\nidentify those requirements in which the State has a substantive interest\nbecause they are the basic and necessary conditions of participation with which\na facility is to comply. (i) Principles of\ncompliance establish basic and necessary conditions with which a facility must\nbe in compliance in order to receive and maintain certification. (ii)\n\nSuch principles shall focus on\nparticular service or administrative components of a facility and/or on an\nentire certification classification. The intent of such principles is to\nclearly indicate the scope and extent of the State's interest. (iii)\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, an\nagency/facility shall have the authority to demonstrate through policies, procedures, other documents, or any means, the methods and practices it will\nutilize to establish and ensure continued compliance with such\nprinciples. (iv)\n\nThese documents\nand/or means shall be made available to, or verified by, OPWDD to assess\ncompliance and to grant initial certification. (2)\nOPWDD reserves the right to monitor\ncompliance at any time pursuant to the responsibilities of the commissioner\nunder the Mental Hygiene Law. Facilities will not be routinely examined against\nprinciples of compliance at surveys for recertification. The process whereby\nprinciples of compliance shall be reviewed and/or enforced shall be contingent\nupon the following premises: (i) A mechanism\nfor informal reconsideration or review shall be established for resolution of\ndisputed issues relative to compliance. (ii)\n\nPrinciples of compliance and standards\nof certification are written to stand independently of one another; however, standards may reflect and/or explicate concepts or requirements set forth in\nprinciples. (iii)\n\nAt the time of\ninitial certification, a facility shall be examined against the concepts and\nrequirements set forth in the principles of compliance. (iv)\n\nAfter initial certification, OPWDD shall\npresume compliance with principles of compliance unless there is an indication\nof noncompliance brought to its attention. Except in the instance of those\nsituations which pose a threat to the health and safety of persons served, noncompliance shall require more than one violation of the principle, unless\nthe situation is pervasive, systemic or egregious. (v) Anyone who has cause to question whether\na facility is operating in conformance with required regulations has a right to\nbring that concern to the attention of OPWDD. (vi)\n\nThe process whereby an allegation of\nnoncompliance with a principle of compliance will be handled shall take into\nconsideration the orderly collection of information, evaluation of the\ninformation, determination of an appropriate course of action, and the\nrecording of same. (vii)\n\nSurvey\nis a term that will be used only in relation to\nsurveyor activity directly linked to determining conformity with standards of\ncertification and other pertinent regulations. (viii)\n\nRoutine surveys for recertification\nshall be based solely on the requirements set forth in standards of\ncertification and any other pertinent regulations. (ix)\n\nThe fundamental focus of surveyors when\nonsite at a facility for recertification purposes shall be to determine\ncompliance with standards of certification. They are not charged with primary\nresponsibility of looking for indications of noncompliance in relation to\nprinciples. (x) Surveyors visiting\na facility to determine compliance with standards of certification shall not\ncite the facility for noncompliance with a principle. Whenever possible, surveyors shall bring additional matters of concern to the attention of the\nfacility during the exit interview. (xi)\n\nThe review of and inquiry into concerns\nbrought to the attention of OPWDD shall be done by those with training to\nunderstand and apply principles of compliance from a broad base of\nexperience. (xii)\n\nAny reviews or\ninquiries shall provide for the use of experiential judgment on the part of\nthose doing the review or inquiry. (xiii)\n\nAn inquiry into an indication of\nnoncompliance with principles of compliance shall not be viewed as or termed a\n\"survey.\"\n(xiv)\n\nAn inquiry into an\nindication of noncompliance shall be for the purpose of OPWDD ascertaining, through the collection of information, that a facility is not conforming to the\nprinciple(s) of compliance in question. It shall not be conceived as a process\nwhereby a facility is compelled to prove compliance: rather, one whereby OPWDD\nsubstantiates that there is a violation. (xv)\n\nWhen an inquiry results in the\nvalidation of an expressed concern, the facility shall be notified of the\nfinding by way of a preliminary report. At that time, the agency/facility shall\nbe given the opportunity to respond and, if considered necessary by the\nfacility, to access an informal reconsideration or review mechanism prior to\nthe issuance of a formal notification of violation of a principle(s) of\ncompliance and the request for a course of action to correct the\nviolation. (xvi)\nOPWDD shall\nprovide an equitable mechanism, whereby there shall be an informal\nreconsideration or review, whenever the facility is concerned with the\ndetermination of noncompliance or the adequacy of the agency's/facility's plan\nof corrective action. The goal of such mechanism shall be to facilitate, whenever possible, resolution of disputes. Such mechanisms shall not neutralize\nor obstruct OPWDD's ability to implement article 16 actions\n(\ni.e., suspension, revocation or limitation of an operating\ncertificate) at any time subsequent to identification of a\nviolation(s). (xvii)\n\nAppropriate\nB/DDSO's (see Glossary) shall be advised of actions taken relative to\nnoncompliance issues at facilities in their service areas. (3)\n\nStandards of\ncertification\nare those criteria which OPWDD specifies as necessary to\nbe met in order for a facility to demonstrate that it can and does provide the\nappropriate environment in which to adequately address the matters of quality\nof care and welfare, rights, safety and/or fiscal accountability as they relate\nto persons receiving services. Surveys are conducted for the purpose of\ndocumenting conformity with standards of certification. Such conformance or an\nacceptable plan of correction is the basis for issuing an operating certificate\nand/or renewing an operating certificate and constitutes one of the underlying\npremises justifying OPWDD's continued presumption of a facility's compliance\nwith the principles of certification. Standards of certification shall be\nsurveyed contingent upon the following premises: (i) By definition, all standards of\ncertification shall be met for a facility to be certified/recertified. Compliance with standards of certification shall include an acceptable plan of\ncorrective action. Except in the instance of those situations which pose a\nthreat to the health and safety of persons receiving services, noncompliance\nshall require more than one violation of the standard, unless the situation is\npervasive, systemic or egregious. (ii)\n\nIn order to obtain initial\ncertification, facilities shall be reviewed and surveyed against both\nprinciples of compliance and standards of certification to assure that the\nfacility, its program and physical plant are in compliance with the\nregulation. (iii)\n\nSurveys for\nrecertification will focus on determining compliance with the specified\nstandards of certification. (iv)\n\nAs\na survey for recertification focuses on standards of certification, the survey\ninstrument shall not instruct the surveyor to review any principles of\ncompliance. (v) The survey shall be\nconducted to ensure the facility's adequacy for\ncertification/recertification. (vi)\n\nSurveys, or portions thereof, shall be conducted when the individuals are at\nthe facility. This will enable surveyors to rely more on observation and\nconversation and less on written documentation as means of verification of\ncompliance with the standards of certification. (vii)\n\nThe interpretation of a specific\nstandard of certification shall never be more restrictive than the written\nstandard. (viii)\n\nOnly paperwork\nexplicitly required by the standard of certification shall be included in the\nsurvey process. (ix)\n\nThe survey\nprocess shall be conducted with a maximum of efficiency and a minimum of\nintrusion. (x) Prior to issuance of\ninitial certification, the agency's/facility's policy and procedure manual\nshall be made available to the OPWDD Division of Quality Assurance for its\ndiscretionary review of any topics related to the principles of compliance and\nstandards of certification, as required by applicable regulation. After initial\ncertification, the agency's/facility's policy and/or procedure manual, and any\nsubsequent changes thereto, will be presumed to be compliant, unless a review\nfor cause determines that this is not so. (xi)\n\nIf the explicit condition(s) of the\nstandard of certification are met, the surveyor shall not further evaluate the\nagency's/facility's means of demonstrating compliance beyond the explicit\nconditions. (xii)\n\nIn State-owned or\n\nState-leased buildings, where physical plant deficiencies do not place\nindividuals in imminent danger of their health or safety, the statement of\ndeficiency shall note the noncompliance, but no plan of corrective action on\nthe part of a facility shall be required. (xiii)\n\nIn order to assure an adequate\nregulatory base to protect a person's rights, both this Part and Part 686 of\nthis Title shall have the same effective date [January 31, 1988]. (xiv)\n\nThe process to be followed for\ncertification and recertification shall not require an agency/facility to\nimplement a plan of corrective action prior to its approval by OPWDD. (d) The OPWDD\ncertification process defined in subdivision\n633.2\n(c) of this\nsection is superseded by requirements in Part 619 of this Title, Certification\nof Facilities and Services. (e) OPWDD expects ongoing compliance with both principles of compliance and\nstandards of certification included in this Part. Therefore, such compliance is\nthe responsibility of the agency and is necessary for continued participation\nas a certified facility or funding as an approved program or service. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
