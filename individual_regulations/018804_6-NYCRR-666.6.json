  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 666.6 - Boundaries of river areas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Boundaries will be established subject to the finding of the commissioner that\nthey are consistent with the purposes and policies of the act and facilitate\nthe management objectives thereof. Boundaries will be delineated and\nestablished to include within the river area those natural, cultural and\nrecreational features whose protection and preservation are necessary to\naccomplish the purposes of the act. Such features may include: scenic areas; natural, scientific and cultural features; flood plains and wetlands; significant fish and wildlife habitats; watershed and hydrological aquifer\nfeatures, ecologically important areas and river-related outdoor recreational\nfacilities. In delineating a river area boundary, consideration may be given to\nthe existence of property boundaries or regulatory boundaries. (b) In recreational river areas, the\ndepartment may designate specific areas as communities that meet the criteria\nfor such areas as specified in section\n666.3\n(m) of this\n\nPart. Also, any local government partially or wholly within a designated river\ncorridor may submit to the department the boundary of a proposed community\ndesignation. Such proposal will include specific boundaries and supporting\ninformation relative to the criteria. The department will publish a notice in\nthe Environmental Notice Bulletin and in at least one newspaper having general\ncirculation in the area of any departmental or local governmental proposal for\na community designation and may hold a public hearing prior to making a\ndecision to adopt, modify or reject such proposal. Boundaries may not exceed a\nwidth of one-half mile from each bank of the river. (c) Boundaries will be established by the\ncommissioner following a public hearing held in or near the river area after a\nriver has been included in the system. The department will publish notices in\nthe Environmental Notice Bulletin and in at least one newspaper having general\ncirculation in the area at least 30 days in advance of any such departmental\nhearing. Failure of any person to be aware of the hearing will not invalidate\nthe boundary subsequently established. Within the Adirondack Park, the\nboundaries will be mutually agreed upon by the department and the Adirondack\n\nPark Agency. (d) Upon establishment\nof the boundary, the commissioner will file a map and narrative description of\nsame with the clerk of each county in which the designated portion of the river\nis located. The commissioner will also notify affected local governments and\nstate agencies of same and provide them with a map and narrative description of\nthe boundary. A notice of establishment of the boundary will be placed in the\n\nEnvironmental Notice Bulletinand a map and narrative description of the\nboundary will be provided to interested parties upon request. (e) Boundaries may be established or amended\nindependently or concurrent with the process of adopting a river management\nplan and any complementary regulations for an individual designated river, as\nprovided by section\n666.7\nof this Part. (f) Upon the designation of a river in the\nsystem and until boundaries for the river are established, the provisions of\nthis Part will be applicable within one-half mile from each bank of the\nriver. (g) Unless otherwise\nspecified, the boundaries of river areas described as a uniform distance from a\nriver bank will themselves wind and turn as the river does. All distances from\na river will be measured horizontally from the bank of the river. (h) The commissioner may amend the boundaries\nof any river area after a public hearing, at the initiative of the department\nor as may be requested by any other person, if in the judgment of the\ncommissioner such amendment would further the purposes and policies of the act\nand more aptly facilitate the management objectives thereof. Notice of the\nhearing will be provided in the same manner as when boundaries are established\noriginally. (i) Upon request by any\nlandowner, tenant, mortgagee, contract vendee or optionee or other person\nhaving a legal interest in a given property, the department will determine the\nterminal points of the river area or classified sections thereof and the bank\nat relevant points along the river area.
