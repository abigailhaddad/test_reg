  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 621.11 - Applications for permit renewals, reissuances and modifications, including transferring or relinquishing permits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Unless instructed\notherwise, applications to renew or modify permits, except SPDES permit\nrenewals, must be submitted to the regional permit administrator of the region\nin which the facility is located (see section\n621.19\nof this Part). Applications\nmust provide information supporting the action sought, and, if for a\nmodification, must include a statement of necessity or reasons for\nmodification. (1)\n\nApplications for renewal\nmust be submitted no less than 180 days prior to permit expiration for the\nfollowing permit types: HWMF, RAPs, Air State Facility permits, title V\nfacility permits, and title IV facility permits, SWMF permits, Water Withdrawal\npermits, Long Island Well permits, Radiation Control permits, and Mined Land\n\nReclamation permits. (2)\n\nApplications for renewal of permit types not listed above in paragraph (1) of\nsubdivision (a) of this section and are listed in subdivision (m) of this\nsection must be submitted no less than 30 days prior to the\nexpiration. (3)\n\nThe foregoing\ndeadlines apply unless otherwise stated as a condition of the permit. (b) SPDES Renewals. Applications\nfor all SPDES permit renewals must be submitted on forms prescribed by the\ndepartment and sent to the Chief Permit Administrator, Division of\n\nEnvironmental Permits, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233-1750. (1)\nSPDES permits renewed pursuant to the\nadministrative renewal procedures contained in Subpart 750-1 of this Title are\nsubject to the public notice, comment, and hearing procedures of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nApplications for renewal\nmust be submitted no less than 180 days prior to permit expiration. (3)\n\nRenewal of a SPDES permit will be treated\nas a new application where the facility that would be or is the source of the\npermitted discharge has not operated during the term of the permit. If the\nrenewal is of a delegated SPDES permit, it will be subject to a full technical\nreview. (c) Transfers. Applications for the transfer of permits in effect, or pending permit\napplications, to a different permittee or applicant, or to change the name of\nthe permittee or applicant, must be submitted on a form prescribed by the\ndepartment and must be done in consideration of the following: (1)\n\nApplications should be submitted at least\n30 days prior to transfer, unless a different time period is required by\nspecific program statute or regulation. (2)\n\nTransfer of permits is not allowed for\nwater withdrawal permits or waste transporter permits including LLRW\ntransporter permits. These activities require the submission of a new\napplication by the proposed new permittee. (3)\n\nThe applicant for permit transfer\nproposes no significant change in the design or operation of the previously\napproved project that was permitted. (4)\n\nThe new permittee must satisfy required\nfinancial obligations and insurance coverage. (5)\nA new permittee may be subject to a\nrecord of compliance review before a decision on permit transfer is\nrendered. (6)\n\nAny noncompliance by\nthe existing permittee, associated with the permits proposed to be transferred, must be resolved to the department's satisfaction. (d) Relinquishments. A permittee may\nrelinquish a permit by sending a written notification to the regional permit\nadministrator of the Region in which the facility is located (See section\n621.19\nof this Part). The\nnotification must: (1)\nidentify the permit to\nbe relinquished by its permit number; (2)\nstate why the permit is being\nrelinquished; (3)\ndescribe how the\nprovisions and conditions of the permit have been satisfied; and\n(4)\nprovide an explanation of any remaining\nactions required at the site or facility prior to terminating the remaining\nterm of the permit. (e) In reviewing a request to relinquish a permit, the department must confirm\nwhether or not permit provisions and conditions have been satisfied, including\npost operational requirements. The department will provide written verification\nof its concurrence with permit relinquishment or provide reasons why the permit\nmust remain in effect. (f) The\ndepartment must notify the applicant and its representative, if applicable, by\nmail of the department's decision on renewals, modifications, reissuances\n(pursuant to subdivision (n) of this section), transfers, or relinquishment of\npermit requests on or before 15 days after receipt of the application except as\nprovided in subdivisions (h), (i), and (j) of this section. (1)\n\nThe department's failure to find a timely\nrenewal application insufficient within 15 days of the department's receipt of\nthe application for renewal or 60 days for delegated permits, will result in\nthe application being deemed sufficient under section 401 of the State\n\nAdministrative Procedure Act. (2)\n\nWhere an application for permit renewal is timely filed, but determined\ninsufficient, and the applicant subsequently provides required information\nprior to permit expiration, the application will be considered both timely and\nsufficient. (3)\n\nWhen the department\nproposes modifications to the provisions of a permit, including permit\nconditions, in conjunction with an application for permit renewal, the\ndepartment must notify the applicant of the proposed changes to the permit\neither through a draft permit on which the applicant will be provided the\nopportunity to review and comment, or by notification pursuant to Section\n621.13\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (4)\n\nAn application for\nrenewal, modification, transfer or permit relinquishment may be denied for\nfailure to meet any of the standards or criteria applicable under any statute\nor regulation pursuant to which the renewal or modification is sought, and\napplicable findings required by article 8 of the ECL or for any of the reasons\nset forth in section\n621.13\n(a)(1)-(6)\nof this Part. (g) If the\ndecision is to deny the permit or requested action under transfer or\nrelinquishment or to issue a permit with substantive conditions, the applicant\nmay request an adjudicatory proceeding by writing the regional permit\nadministrator or the chief permit administrator, as instructed in the decision\nnotification, within 30 days of mailing of the decision to deny or date the\npermit with substantive conditions is issued. The applicant must also submit a\ncopy of a written request for an adjudicatory proceeding to the chief\nadministrative law judge. When a permit decision or notice of intent has been\nissued for a delegated permit, the request for an adjudicatory proceeding must\nalso comply with the requirements of section\n624.2\nof this Title and for SPDES\npermits, the request for an adjudicatory proceeding must also comply with the\nrequirements of section 750-1.26 of this Title. The adjudicatory proceeding\nwill commence within 60 days of the chief administrative law judge's receipt of\nthe applicant's request. (h) The\ndepartment may determine that an application for renewal or modification will\nbe treated as a new application for a permit in the following circumstances: (1)\nthe application involves a material\nchange in existing permit conditions or in the scope of the permitted actions\n(non-material changes include administrative changes such as transfer of\nownership or changes in legally responsible parties, correction of\ntypographical errors, updates to facility or permittee contacts, and routine\nupdates to operational plans); (2)\nthere is newly discovered material information or there has been a material\nchange in environmental conditions, relevant technology or applicable law or\nregulations since the issuance of the existing permit; (3)\na hearing or opportunity for public\ncomment is required by law or the department determines that an opportunity for\npublic comment or hearing is necessary; (4)\nthe renewal application is not timely or\nsufficient; (5)\nany of the grounds\nlisted in Section\n621.13\n(a)(1)-(6)\nof this Part apply; or\n(6)\nwhere\nany regulations or law pertaining to permits subject to this Part specify that\npermit renewals or modifications shall be treated as new applications. In such circumstances, on or before 15 days after receipt\nof an application, the department must mail the applicant notice of its\ndetermination, and a determination of whether the application is\ncomplete. (i) Applications for the renewal or modification of delegated permits and permits\ncontaining Federally enforceable emission caps will be treated as new\napplications under this Part and are major. Minor modifications of title V\nfacility and Air State Facility permits as set forth in Subparts 201-5 and\n201-6 of this Title will be treated as new minor projects under this Part. This\nparagraph does not apply to: (1)\nminor\nmodifications for HWMF permits as set forth in section\n373-1.7\nof this Title; (2)\nadministrative amendments of Title V\nfacility permits as set forth in Part 201 of this Title; or\n(3)\nminor modifications of SPDES permits as\nset forth in 40 CFR\n122.63, July 1, 1987 (see section\n621.16\nof this Part). (j) If the department or its agent\nfails to mail the applicant the notice of its decision as required in\nsubdivision (f) or (h) of this section, the applicant is entitled to make\nnotice of that failure and receive a decision within five working days pursuant\nto section\n621.10\n(b) and (c)\nof this Part. (k) Notwithstanding\nany other provision of this section, section\n621.3\n(d) and (e)\nof this Part shall apply. (l) Pursuant to section 401(2) of the State Administrative Procedure Act, when a\ntimely and sufficient application for renewal of a permit for an activity of a\ncontinuing nature per subdivisions (a), (b), and (m) of this section is\nsubmitted, the existing permit does not expire until the department has made a\nfinal decision on the renewal application and if the renewal application is\ndenied, the permit is in effect until the last day for seeking review of the\ndenial or any later date set by a court order. (m) Activities of a continuing nature are\nthose undertaken pursuant to the following permits: (1)\nHWMF; (2)\nRAPs; (3)\n\nAir pollution control (Air State\nfacility, Title V facility and Title IV facility); (4)\nSWMF; (5)\n\nWater Withdrawal and Long Island\n\nWells; (6)\n\nRadiation\n\nControl; (7)\n\nMined Land\n\nReclamation; (8)\nSPDES; (9)\n\nWaste Transporter; and\n(10)\nLNG/LPG. (n) Reissuances. Activities undertaken\npursuant to permit types not listed in subdivision (m) of this section are not\nsubject to the provisions of subdivision (l) of this section. However, expired\npermits for such activities may be reissued for a new permit term where the\ncriteria in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this subdivision are met: (1)\nthere is no change in the activities to\nbe undertaken from those that were previously permitted; (2)\nthere has been no material change in\nenvironmental conditions; (3)\nthe\nrequest for reissuance of the permit is made within two years of the date the\nprevious permit expired; (4)\nif\napplicable, all fees and sureties are paid; (5)\nthere are no outstanding violations of\nthe ECL, or other environmental laws administered by the department at the\nfacility or site that is the subject of the previous permit; and\n(6)\nthe time period from the effective date\nof the initially issued permit to the expiration date of the reissued permit\nmust not exceed 10 years.
