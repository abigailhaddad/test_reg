Tit. 20 §§ 4-2.15 - Receipts received by credit card processors\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A(5)(c)(4))\n(a) For purposes of this Part, the following\ndefinitions shall apply: (1)\n\nCredit card\nprocessor means an entity, whether it is a corporation or an unincorporated\nentity, that derives 50% or more of its gross receipts from any or all of the\nfollowing: credit card authorization processing, clearing processing, settlement processing, and volume-based activities. In the case of a combined\nreport, whether an entity is a credit card processor is determined on a\ncorporation-by-corporation basis. The apportionment rules described in this\nsection and section 210-A(5)(c)(4) shall apply only to those receipts generated\nby the entities in the combined report that qualify as credit card\nprocessors. (2)\n\nAuthorization\nprocessing means the routing of transaction data from a merchant to an acquirer\nbank or from an acquirer bank to an issuer bank for approval or rejection and\nthe routing of that approval or rejection back to the originating party. Authorization includes the various data enhancement and security services the\ncredit card processor performs on the transaction data during the process of\nrouting the data between the acquirer bank and the issuer bank. (3)\n\nClearing processing means the service of\nprocessing of a batch of hundreds or thousands of previously-authorized\ntransactions to determine the net amounts due to or from issuer banks and\nacquirer banks. (4)\n\nSettlement\nprocessing means the service of delivering instructions for the actual movement\nof funds between issuer banks and acquirer banks that reflects the amounts\ndetermined to be due to or from each entity during clearing\nprocessing. (5)\n\nCredit card\nprocessor's network means the hardware and software that enable a credit card\nprocessor to facilitate the transfer of financial transaction information to\nand from issuer banks and acquirer banks and, in the case of a third-party\nprocessor, to and from merchants, including by any of the following: receiving, processing, and relaying such financial transaction information. (6)\n\nVolume-based activities means services\nthat are charged to customers measured on the dollar volume or number of credit\ncard transactions, but not those activities described elsewhere in this\nsubdivision. (7)\n\nAccess point means\na physical location at which a credit card processor's customers access or may\naccess the credit card processor's network. (8)\n\nPercent of New York State access points\nmeans the number of access points located in New York State divided by the\ntotal number of access points in the United States. (9)\n\nAcquirer bank means a financial\ninstitution that contracts with merchants to accept payments by credit\ncard. (10)\n\nIssuer bank means a\nfinancial institution that issues credit cards to account holders. (b) (1)\n\nExcept as provided for in paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision, the amount of receipts from authorization processing, clearing processing, and settlement processing earned by credit card processors\nincluded in New York receipts is the product of all such receipts and the\npercent of the credit card processor's New York State access points that could\ngenerate receipts subject to this paragraph. All such receipts are included in\neverywhere receipts. (2)\n\nIf the\ncredit card processor is a third-party processor and, after exercising due\ndiligence, cannot identify the access points for its authorization, clearing, and settlement processing transactions on behalf of issuer banks or acquirer\nbanks, the amount of receipts from those transactions earned from banks with\nbilling addresses, kept in the normal course of the credit card processor's\noperations, in New York State shall be included in New York receipts. All such\nreceipts are included in everywhere receipts. (c) (1)\n\nExcept as provided for in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the amount of all\nother receipts, including receipts from volume-based activities, received by\ncredit card processors not specifically addressed in subdivisions (1) through\n(9) of section 210-A shall be included in New York receipts by multiplying the\ntotal amount of such other receipts by the average percentage of: (i) 8%; and\n(ii)\nthe percent of the credit card\nprocessor's New York State access points. (2)\n\nIf the credit card processor is a\nthird-party processor that uses the provisions of paragraph (2) of subdivision\n(b) of this section, then the amount of all other receipts, including receipts\nfrom volume-based activities, received by such credit card processor not\nspecifically addressed in subdivisions (1) through (9) of section 210-A\nincluded in New York receipts shall be determined by multiplying the total\namount of such other receipts by the average percentage of: (i) 8%; and\n(ii)\nthe percent of its customers with\nbilling addresses in New York State. (d) If it shall appear that the receipts\nincluded in New York receipts pursuant to this section do not accurately\nreflect the locations where such receipts of the credit card processor are\nearned because the credit card processor has receipts arising from activities\noutside of the United States, then the credit card processor is authorized to\ncalculate New York receipts pursuant to this section based on the New York\n\nState percentage of total access points, which shall be calculated by dividing\nthe number of access points physically located in New York State by the total\nnumber of access points used to generate the receipts being apportioned under\nthis section. The corporation bears the burden of proof to demonstrate that\napplying the apportionment rules contained in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this\nsection do not result in an accurate apportionment of the receipts subject to\nthe rules in this section within New York State.
