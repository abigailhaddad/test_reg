  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 202-2.4 - Procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Submission\ndates for emission statements. Emission statements shall report actual annual\nemissions generated from the facility during the previous calendar year and\nmust be submitted by the deadlines set forth below. (1)\n\nUntil a facility is required to submit\nannual emission statements electronically, emission statements submitted via\ncourier must be postmarked (or equivalent) to the department no later than\n\nApril 15th of each year. (2)\n\nUntil\na facility is required to submit annual emission statements electronically, emission statements submitted electronically must be received by the department\non or before April 15th of each year. (3)\n\nOnce a facility is required to submit\nannual emission statements electronically, emission statements must be\nsubmitted to the department per the following schedule beginning the reporting\nyear that a Title V permit containing a condition mandating electronic\nsubmittal is issued: (i) March 15th of each\nyear for facilities with 3 or fewer processes listed in their Title V\npermit; (ii)\n\nMarch 31st of each\nyear for facilities with 4 to 6 processes listed in their Title V\npermit; (iii)\n\nApril 15th of each\nyear for facilities with 7 to 12 processes listed in their Title V permit; or\n(iv)\n\nApril 30th of each year for\nfacilities with 13 or more processes listed in their Title V permit. (4)\nA facility may submit its\nemission statement via courier per the schedule in paragraph 202-2.4(a)(3) of\nthis Subpart in lieu of electronic submission under the following conditions: (i) data cannot be labeled as confidential\nbusiness information using the electronic interface by the facility in\naccordance with Part 616 of this Title; or\n(ii)\nthe facility receives permission from\nthe department after demonstrating a need to submit via courier due to a\nfailure of the electronic reporting interface. (b) If a facility's submission's date occurs\non a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the annual emission statement must\nbe postmarked or submitted no later than the next business day immediately\nfollowing the submission date. (c) Not withstanding subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section, the department\nreserves the right to extend the submission deadline provided a facility can\ndemonstrate by clear and convincing evidence, that due to unavoidable\ncircumstances, it is unable to have the completed emission statement postmarked\nor submitted on or before the submission date. All extension requests are\nsubject to the approval of the department and will be granted on a case-by-case\nbasis. Extension requests must be submitted to the department in writing or by\nemail by the facility fifteen days before the submission date and must include, at a minimum, the following information: (1)\nthe reason(s) for the extension request; and\n(2)\nthe date the statement will be\nsubmitted. (d) Emission\nestimates shall be based on the owner's or operator's use of the methods listed\nbelow and should be consistent with the compliance determination and monitoring\nmethods specified in the Title V operating permit. The methods are generally\nlisted in order of most preferred to least preferred. Facility owners or\noperators shall utilize the method which results in the best possible emission\nestimate: (1)\ncontinuous emissions monitoring\nsystems (CEMS); (2)\nmaterial\nbalance calculations or fuel analysis; (3)\nstack test of emissions, including date\nof test; (4)\nstack test of\nemissions from identical or similar emission sources; (5)\npublished emission factors; (6)\nmodeling, emission estimation\nsoftware; (7)\nbest engineering\njudgment; and\n(8)\nmanufacturer's\nguarantee. (e) The use of\nCEMS data is required for all processes where such equipment is installed. Owners or operators who utilize CEMS must account for emissions occurring\nduring all hours of operation, including those hours for which valid CEMS data\nwas not obtained. Emissions from hours when CEMS data was not collected must be\nestimated by using the procedures given in subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (f) Data substitution\nprocedures used to satisfy subdivision (e) of this section above shall comply\nwith the following: (1)\nfor units and\ncontaminants that are subject to 40 CFR part\n75, applicable data substitution\nprocedures from that regulation shall be used; or\n(2)\nfor units and/or contaminants not subject\nto 40 CFR part\n75; (i) the 90th percentile\nvalue of all hourly values measured during the previous 90 days while burning\nthe same fuel shall be used; or\n(ii)\nmethods specified in the hierarchy\nlisted under subdivision (d) of this section may be used, subject to the\napproval of the department. (g) If a source owner or operator is required\nto use a specific monitoring method to demonstrate compliance with other\napplicable requirements, the department may require that the emission estimates\nfor the corresponding processes in the emission statement be based on\ninformation obtained from that specific monitoring method. The department may\nreject the use of a proposed method for a particular process if it can be\ndemonstrated that the method does not provide a reliable representation of\nemissions. (h) Any owner or operator\nof a reportable facility shall transmit the emission statement to the\ndepartment in a format acceptable to the department. With the prior approval of\nthe department, an emission statement which meets the requirements of this\nsection may be submitted on electronic storage media or transmitted\nelectronically. Any electronic submissions must be properly formatted for\nprinting and accompanied by an acceptably signed certification page, or the\noriginal signed certification page must be submitted under separate\ncover. (i) The owner or operator of\na facility may request that certain information submitted in an emission\nstatement be designated as a trade secret or confidential commercial\ninformation, in accordance with Part 616 of this Title. The determination\nwhether to grant such a request shall be made by the department in accordance\nwith the procedures contained in Part 616 of this Title, taking into account\napplicable State and Federal laws on public disclosure. All information\nrequired on the annual emission statement must be reported to the department. The department may withhold certain process level information from public\ndisclosure, where the department or a court of competent jurisdiction\ndetermines that such information constitutes trade secrets or confidential\ncommercial information within the meaning of Part 616 of this Title, the Public\n\nOfficers Law or other applicable State or Federal law. (j) Department review and approval. The\ndepartment shall notify the facility if any part of the submitted emission\nstatement is incomplete or incorrect. The department will allow the facility up\nto 15 business days following the facility's receipt of the department's notice\nto provide the required contents of the emission statement. If a complete and\naccurate emission statement is not submitted to the department by the\nsubmission date or within 15 days after receipt of the department's\nnotification of an incomplete or incorrect emission statement, the facility may\nbe subject to enforcement action including but not limited to monetary\nfines.
