(b) Agricultural districting advisory\ncommittee means a committee, established by a county legislative body pursuant\nto section\n302\nof the Agriculture and Markets Law, to advise the county legislative body and\nto work with the county planning board, in relation to the establishment, modification or termination of agricultural districts. (c) Agricultural soil group means one of ten\nmineral soil groups or four organic soil groups established by this\nsystem. (d) Agricultural value\nassessment means an annual assessment of land used in agricultural production\nwhich satisfies the requirement of section\n305\nor\n306\nof the Agriculture and Markets Law and is thereby subject to an agricultural\nvalue ceiling. (e) Agricultural\nvalue per acre means the average value per acre of land used in agricultural\nproduction as determined annually on the basis of its agricultural value\nwithout consideration for other potential uses. (f) Assessor means the person having the\npower to assess property for taxation. (g) Board means the State Board of\n\nEqualization and Assessment. (h) Commissioner means the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of the State of\n\nNew York. (i) Commitment means a\ndeclaration by the owner of land used in agricultural production located\noutside of an agricultural district that such land will be used exclusively for\nagricultural production for the next succeeding eight years. (j) Cultivated land means land used for\ngrowing crops, hay, pasture, and permanent pasture for the preceding two\nyears. (k) Department means the New\n\nYork State Department of Agriculture and Markets. (l) Farm woodland means any land of two acres\nof more which is used primarily for the production of woodland\nproducts. (m) Land classification\nsystem means the system established by the commissioner incorporating soil\nproductivity and capability for use by the State Board of Equalization and\n\nAssessment in determining agricultural value per acre, pursuant to section\n304\nof the Agriculture and Markets Law. (n) Mineral soils means all those soils that\ndo not meet the criteria for organic soils established by this Part. (o) Nonagricultural land means land used for\nnonagricultural purposes. (p) Organic soils means muck soils which consist of well-decomposed organic\nmaterials ranging in depth from 16 to 100 inches located over mineral soil\ndeposits. The classification of these soils is defined in Soil Taxonomy--A\nBasic System of Soil Classification for Making and Interpreting Soil Surveys, U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation System, Agricultural Handbook No. 436. (q) Soil capability means the physical\nability of the soil to maintain agricultural production without sustaining\ndamage to the soil structure of the surface layer while being adequately\nprotected from erosion and other means of deterioration. (r) Soil map means a map, on file with the\ncounty soil and water conservation district office, showing the distribution of\nsoil mapping units in relation to the prominent physical and cultural features\nof the earth's surface. (s) Soil\nmap unit means the name of a specific kind of soil including its slope and\nother specific features as designated by a specific soil symbol on a soil\nmap. (t) Soil productivity means\nthe average yield for a specified crop under a prudent system of\nmanagement. (u) Soil productivity\nindex system means the system developed by Cornell University, Department of\n\nAgronomy, in cooperation with the U.S.D.A. Soil Conservation Service, Syracuse, NY to be used to establish an individual soil's productivity rating. (v) Soil scientist means a person having\nspecial knowledge of the physical, chemical and biological sciences applicable\nto the genesis and morphology of soils as natural bodies and of the methods to\ndescribe, classify and map soil units. This person must possess a minimum of\ntwo years experience in classifying and mapping soils and at least a bachelors\ndegree, with 30 semester hours or equivalent in biology, physical science and\nearth science with a minimum of 15 semester hours in soil science. Individuals\nwho do not meet the above minimum qualifications but who possess at least 10\nyears experience mapping soils are qualified if they have completed at least 10\nsemester hours in soil science. (w) County soil and water conservation district means the district created pursuant\nto section\n6\nof the Soil and Water Conservation Districts\n\nLaw. (x) Total digestible nutrients\n(TDN) means a standard evaluation of the digestibility of a particular\nlivestock feed, including all the digestible organic nutrients: protein, fiber, nitrogen-free extract, and fat. (y) Universal soil loss equation means an equation used for the design of water\nerosion control systems. The equation is set forth in Agricultural Handbook\n#537--Predicting Rainfall Erosion Losses, Science and Education Administration, 1978, as: A = RK(LS)CP\nwherein: A = average annual soil loss in tons per acre per year\nR = rainfall factor\nK = soil erodibility factor\n(L = length of slope and\nS = percent of slope factor)\nC = cropping and management factor\nP = conservation practice factor\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
