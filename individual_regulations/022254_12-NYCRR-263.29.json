  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 263.29 - Certification of representatives; requests for review\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Hearing officer\ncertification. The hearing officer, upon the completion of their\ninvestigation, shall certify to the parties the name or names of the\nrepresentatives selected, if any, or make other disposition of the\nmatter. (b) Finality of\ncertification and filing request for review. The certification issued\nby the hearing officer shall be final and binding and the obligation to bargain\nshall attach. Objections to the hearing officer's decision and certification\nmay be filed with the board in accordance with section\n263.28\nof this Part. The board\nwill only grant review under compelling circumstances. Accordingly, a request\nfor review may be granted only upon one or more of the following grounds: (1)\n\nThat a substantial question of law or\npolicy is raised because of: (i) The absence\nof; or\n(ii)\nA unexplained departure\nfrom officially reported FLFLPA or applicable SERA precedent. (2)\n\nThat the hearing officer's\ndecision on a substantial factual issue is clearly erroneous on the record and\nsuch error prejudicially affects the rights of a party. (3)\n\nThat the conduct of any hearing or any\nruling made in connection with the proceeding has resulted in prejudicial\nerror. (4)\n\nThat there are\ncompelling reasons for reconsideration of an important board rule or\npolicy. (c) Contents of request for review. A request for review must be a\nself-contained document enabling the board to rule on the basis of its contents\nwithout the necessity of recourse to the record; however, the board may, in its\ndiscretion, examine the record in evaluating the request. Such request may not\nraise any issue or allege any facts not timely presented to the hearing\nofficer. (d) Effect of\nrequest for review. The grant of a request for review shall not stay\nthe hearing officer's action unless otherwise ordered by the board. (e) Expedited treatment. All\nrequests for review shall be afforded expedited treatment by the\nboard. (f) Preclusion. The hearing officer's actions are final unless a\nrequest for review is granted. Failure to request review shall preclude such\nparties from relitigating, in any related subsequent unfair labor practice\ncharge proceeding, any issue which was, or could have been, raised in the\nrepresentation proceeding. Denial of a request for review shall constitute an\naffirmance of the hearing officer's action which shall also preclude\nrelitigating any such issues in any related subsequent unfair labor practice\nproceeding. (g) Transmission of the record. Immediately upon issuance of an\norder granting a request for review by the board, the hearing officer shall\ntransmit the record to the board. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
