  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 366.2 - Establishing date of filing for documents transmitted to the comptroller via facsimile (\"fax\") machine\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhenever a statute requires that document be filed with the\n\nComptroller, as Administrative Head of the New York State and Local Retirement\n\nSystems, within a prescribed period of time or by a specified date, such\ndocument will be considered filed on the date that it has been successfully\ntransmitted via facsimile (\"fax machine\") to the Retirement System. Notwithstanding the fact that the filing date may be established as the date of\nsuccessful transmission via facsimile (\"fax\") machine, no document shall be\ndeemed filed on the basis of successful facsimile transmission unless the\noriginal document is subsequently received by the Retirement\n\nSystem. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n366.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
