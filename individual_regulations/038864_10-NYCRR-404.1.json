  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 404.1 - Background and Intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Physical\nand behavioral health conditions (i.e., mental illness and/or substance use\ndisorders) often occur at the same time. Persons with behavioral disorders\nfrequently experience chronic illnesses such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. These illnesses can be prevented and are\ntreatable. However, barriers to primary care, as well as the difficulty in\nnavigating complex health care systems, are a major obstacle to individuals\nwith behavioral health disorders seeking treatment for their physical\nconditions. (b) Primary care\nsettings have, at the same time, become a gateway to the behavioral health\nsystem, as people seek care for mild to moderate behavioral health needs (e.g., anxiety, depression, or substance use) in primary health care settings. Health\ncare providers have long recognized that many patients have both physical and\nbehavioral health care needs, yet physical and behavioral health care services\nhave traditionally been provided and paid for separately. Even behavioral\nhealth services have traditionally been treated in a bifurcated system (e.g., substance use disorder treatment is treated separately from mental health\ntreatment). (c) The term\n\"integrated care\" describes the systematic coordination of primary and\nbehavioral health care services. The growing awareness of the prevalence and\ncost of comorbid physical and behavioral health conditions, and the increased\nrecognition that integrated care can improve outcomes and achieve savings, has\nled to increasing acceptance of delivery models that integrate physical and\nbehavioral health care. Moreover, most patients prefer to have their physical\nand behavioral health care delivered in one place, by the same team of\nclinicians. (d) Accordingly, these\nregulations will prescribe standards for the integration of physical and\nbehavioral health care services in certain outpatient programs licensed by the\n\nDepartment of Health, the Office of Mental Health, and/or the Office of\n\nAlcoholism and Substance Abuse Services.
