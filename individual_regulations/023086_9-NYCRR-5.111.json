  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5.111 - Executive order no. 111: directing state agencies to be more energy efficient and environmentally aware: \"green and clean state buildings and vehicles\"\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, New York is dedicated to the mutually compatible\ngoals of environmental protection and economic growth; WHEREAS, New York has adopted measures designed to allow\nenergy markets to operate more competitively and has significantly reduced\ntaxes in order to reduce energy costs and encourage continued economic\ngrowth; WHEREAS, the generation and use of energy has a significant\nimpact on the environment, contributing to emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, greenhouse gases, and other pollutants; WHEREAS, State government is a major consumer of energy, spending approximately $300 million per year and purchasing approximately 1,500\nnew vehicles annually with a concomitant impact on the environment; and\nWHEREAS, it is appropriate that State government assume a\nleadership role in promoting the efficient use of energy and natural resources\nin the interest of the long-term protection and enhancement of our environment, our economy, and the health of our children and future generations of New\n\nYorkers. NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE E. PATAKI, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\n\nLaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: I. New Energy Efficiency Goals\n\nAll agencies and departments over which the Governor has\n\nExecutive authority, and all public benefit corporations and public authorities\nthe heads of which are appointed by the Governor (hereinafter referred to as\n\"State agencies and other affected entities\"), shall seek to achieve a\nreduction in energy consumption by all buildings they own, lease or operate of\n35 percent by 2010 relative to 1990 levels. All State agencies and other\naffected entities shall establish agency-wide reduction targets and associated\nschedules to reach this goal and shall also be responsible for establishing\npeak electric demand reduction targets for each state facility by 2005 and\n2010. No buildings will be exempt from these goals except pursuant to criteria\nto be developed by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority\n(\"NYSERDA\"), in consultation with the Division of the Budget (\"DOB\"), the\n\nOffice of General Services (\"OGS\") and the Advisory Council on State Energy\n\nEfficiency (\"Advisory Council\") as established herein. II. State Buildings Energy Efficiency\n\nPractices\nA. Existing Buildings. Effective immediately, State agencies and other affected\nentities shall implement energy efficiency practices with respect to the\noperation and maintenance of all buildings that they own, lease or operate. Such practices may include, but shall not be limited to: (1)\nshutting off office equipment when it is\nnot being used; (2)\nadjusting the\nsetting of space temperatures; (3)\nturning off lighting in unoccupied areas; (4)\ninspecting and re-commissioning or\nre-tuning heating, air conditioning and ventilation equipment to ensure optimal\nperformance; and\n(5)\ncycling and\nrestarting equipment on a staggered basis to shed electricity loads and\nminimize peak electricity demand usage. State agencies and other affected\nentities shall strive to meet the ENERGY STAR® building criteria for energy\nperformance and indoor environmental quality in their existing buildings to the\nmaximum extent practicable. Within 180 days of the date of this Executive\n\nOrder, NYSERDA shall develop guidelines to help agencies and other affected\nentities implement energy efficiency practices in their buildings. B. New Buildings and Substantial\n\nRenovation of Existing Buildings. In the design, construction, operation and maintenance of\nnew buildings, State agencies and other affected entities shall, to the maximum\nextent practicable, follow guidelines for the construction of \"Green\n\nBuildings,\" including guidelines set forth in Tax Law § 19, which created\nthe Green Buildings Tax Credit, and the U.S. Green Buildings Council's LEEDTM\nrating system. Effective immediately, State agencies and other affected\nentities engaged in the construction of new buildings shall achieve at least a\n20 percent improvement in energy efficiency performance relative to levels\nrequired by the State's Energy Conservation Construction Code, as amended. For\nsubstantial renovation of existing buildings, State agencies and other affected\nentities shall achieve at least a ten percent improvement. State agencies and\nother affected entities shall incorporate energy-efficient criteria consistent\nwith ENERGY STAR® and any other energy efficiency levels as may be\ndesignated by NYSERDA into all specifications developed for new construction\nand renovation. III. Procurement of Energy-Efficient Products\n\nEffective immediately, State agencies and other affected\nentities shall select ENERGY STAR® energy-efficient products when acquiring\nnew energy-using products or replacing existing equipment. NYSERDA shall adopt\nguidelines designating target energy efficiency levels for those products for\nwhich ENERGY STAR® labels are not yet available. IV. Purchase of Power from Renewable Sources\n\nState agencies and other affected entities with\nresponsibility for purchasing energy shall increase their purchase of energy\ngenerated from the following technologies: wind, solar thermal, photovoltaics, sustainably managed biomass, tidal, geothermal, methane waste and fuel cells. State agencies and other affected entities shall seek to purchase sufficient\nquantities of energy from these technologies so that 10 percent of the overall\nannual electric energy requirements of buildings owned, leased or operated by\n\nState agencies and other affected entities will be met through these\ntechnologies by 2005, increasing to 20 percent by 2010. No agency or affected\nentity will be exempt from these goals except pursuant to criteria to be\ndeveloped by NYSERDA, in consultation with DOB, OGS and the Advisory\n\nCouncil. V. Procurement of\n\nClean Fuel Vehicles\n\nState agencies and other affected entities shall procure\nincreasing percentages of alternative-fuel vehicles, including hybrid-electric\nvehicles, as part of their annual vehicle acquisition plans. By 2005, at least\n50 percent of new light-duty vehicles acquired by each agency and affected\nentity shall be alternative-fueled vehicles, and by 2010, 100 percent of all\nnew light-duty vehicles shall be alternative-fueled vehicles, with the\nexception of specialty, police or emergency vehicles as designated by DOB. State agencies and other affected entities that operate medium- and heavy-duty\nvehicles shall implement strategies to reduce petroleum consumption and\nemissions by using alternative fuels and improving vehicle fleet fuel\nefficiency. VI. Role of\nNYSERDA and Creation of the Advisory Council on State Energy Efficiency\nNYSERDA shall coordinate implementation of this Executive\n\nOrder and shall assist each agency and affected entity in the fulfillment of\nthe responsibilities imposed herein in a cost-effective manner.
