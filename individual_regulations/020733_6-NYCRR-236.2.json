  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 236.2 - Applicability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any owner or\noperator of a synthetic organic chemical manufacturing facility where such\nchemicals were being produced prior to the effective date of this Part, must: (1)\nprepare a leak detection and repair plan\nin accordance with section\n236.5\nof this Part; and\n(2)\nbe in compliance with the provisions of\nthis Part within 180 days of the effective date of this Part. (b) Any owner or operator of a\nsynthetic organic chemical manufacturing facility where such chemicals are\nfirst manufactured on or after the effective date of this Part is required to\ndemonstrate compliance with this Part upon start-up. (c) Components subject to Federal regulations\nwhich require either an equal or more stringent leak detection and repair\nprogram (i.e., equivalent or lower definition of leak and equivalent or more\nfrequent monitoring requirements), or equal or more stringent equipment\nspecifications, are deemed to be in compliance with the provisions of this Part\ncontingent on the source owner or operator complying with such Federal\nregulations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n236.2\n\nThe department is cognizant of pending National Emission\n\nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants which regulate process unit components\nto control fugitive emissions of volatile hazardous air pollutants. These\nstandards would regulate many of the same components as Part 236. Where the\n\nFederal standards are adopted to be more stringent than those of Part 236, the\ndepartment will accept compliance with the Federal standards in lieu of\ncompliance with this Part, contingent on the adoption and implementation of the\n\nFederal standards. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
