  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 522.3 - Legal base\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Section\n7.09\nof the\n\nMental Hygiene Law authorizes the Commissioner to adopt regulations necessary\nand proper to implement any matter under his or her jurisdiction. (b) Section\n29.23\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law authorizes directors of facilities operated by the\n\nOffice of Mental Health to receive or obtain funds or certain personal property\ndue or belonging to individuals receiving services from their facilities up to\nan amount or value not exceeding twenty-five thousand dollars, and to seek to\nplace, to the extent permissible by law, funds in excess of the appropriate\neligibility level for government benefits into a Medicaid exception trust, including a special needs trust or similar device, after the needs of the\nindividual have been met. The statute also mandates the director to seek to\nestablish such a trust when the director receives a windfall payment on behalf\nof an individual which, in combination with other funds held on behalf of such\nperson, would cause the individual to become ineligible for government\nbenefits. (c) Section\n33.07\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law requires the Commissioner of the Office of Mental Health\nto promulgate regulations regarding the management and protection of funds\nreceived by facility directors as representative payees for individuals\nreceiving services from their facilities. The statute also mandates the\ndirector of a facility operated by the Office of Mental Health to seek to\nestablish a Medicaid exception trust, including a special needs trust or\nsimilar device, when the director receives a lump sum retroactive benefit, as\ndefined in the statute, in his or her capacity as representative payee on\nbehalf of an individual which, in combination with other funds held on behalf\nof such person, would cause the individual to become ineligible for government\nbenefits. (d) 20 C.F.R. Section\n404.2040(d)\nprovides that\nrepresentative payees may not be required to use benefit payments to satisfy a\ndebt of the beneficiary, if the debt arose prior to the first month for which\npayments are certified to a payee. If the debt arose prior to this time, a\npayee may satisfy it only if the current and reasonably foreseeable needs of\nthe beneficiary are met. (e) Section\n43.03\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law recognizes that although the Commissioner of the Office\nof Mental Health is authorized to reduce or waive fees in cases of inability to\npay or other reason, the patient, and any fiduciary or representative payee\nholding assets for him or her, or on his or her behalf are jointly and\nseverally liable for the fees for services rendered to the patient.
