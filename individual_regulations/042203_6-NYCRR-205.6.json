  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 205.6 - Compliance provisions and test methods\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose of determining compliance\nwith the VOC content limits in section\n205.3\n(a) of this\n\nPart, the VOC content of a coating shall be determined by using the procedures\ndescribed in paragraphs (b)(l) or (2) of this section, as appropriate. The VOC\ncontent of a tint base shall be determined prior to the addition of the\ncolorant. If the manufacturer does not recommend thinning, the VOC content must\nbe calculated for the product as supplied. If the manufacturer recommends\nthinning, the VOC content must be calculated including the maximum amount of\nthinning solvent recommended by the manufacturer. If the coating is a\nmulti-component product, the container must display the VOC content as mixed or\ncatalyzed. If the coating contains silanes, siloxanes, or other ingredients\nthat generate ethanol or other VOCs during the curing process, the VOC content\nmust include the VOCs emitted during curing. (b) Calculation of VOC content. (1)\n\nWith the exception of low solids\ncoatings, determine the VOC content in grams of VOC per liter of coating\nthinned to the manufacturer's maximum recommendation, excluding the volume of\nany water and exempt compounds. Determine the VOC content using the following\nequation: VOC Content =\n(Ws - Ww -\nWec)\n/\n(Vm - Vw - Vec)\nwhere: VOC content = grams of VOC per liter of coating\n\nWs = weight of volatiles, in grams\n\nWw = weight of water, in grams\n\nWec = weight of exempt compounds, in grams\n\nVm = volume of coating, in liters\n\nVw = volume of water, in liters\n\nVec = volume of exempt compounds, in liters\n(2)\n\nFor low solids coatings, determine the VOC content in units of grams of VOC per liter of coating thinned\nto the manufacturer's maximum recommendation, including the volume of any water\nand exempt compounds. Determine the VOC content using the following equation: VOC Content (ls) =\n(Ws - Ww -\nWec)\n/\n(Vm)\nwhere: VOC content (ls) = the VOC content of a low solids coating\nin grams per liter of coating\n\nWs = weight of volatiles, in grams\n\nWw = weight of water, in grams\n\nWec = weight of exempt compounds, in grams\n\nVm = volume of coating, in liters\n(c) VOC content of\ncoating. To determine the physical properties of a coating in order\nto perform the calculations in subdivision (b) of this section, the reference\nmethod for VOC content is found at 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, method 24 (2000)\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), except as\nprovided in subdivisions (d) and (e) of this section. An alternate method to\ndetermine the VOC content of coatings is South Coast Air Quality Management\n\nDistrict Method 304-91 (Revised February 1996) (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). The exempt\ncompounds content shall be determined by methods referenced in ASTM D3960-05\n(2013), South Coast Air Quality Management District Method 303-91 (Revised\n\nAugust 1996), or Bay Area Air Quality Management District (BAAQMD) Method 41\n(Revised 2005), as applicable (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). To determine\nthe VOC content of a coating, the manufacturer may use 40 CFR part\n60, appendix\nA, method 24 (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), or an\nalternative method, as provided in subdivision (c) of this section, manufacturer's formulation data, or any other reasonable means for predicting\nthat the coating has been formulated as intended (\ne.g., quality assurance checks, recordkeeping). However, if there are any\ninconsistencies between the results of a 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, method 24\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) test and any\nother methods for determining VOC content, the 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, method 24 (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) results will\ngovern, except when an alternative method is approved as specified in\nsubdivision (d) of this section. The director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental Conservation may require the manufacturer to\nconduct a 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, method 24 (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) analysis to\ndetermine the VOC content. (d) Alternative test methods. Other test methods demonstrated to provide results that are\nacceptable for purposes of determining compliance with subdivision (c) of this\nsection, after review and approval in writing by the director, Division of Air\n\nResources, Department of Environmental Conservation and the EPA, may also be\nused. (e) Methacrylate\ntraffic coating markings. Analysis of methacrylate multicomponent coatings used as\ntraffic marking coatings shall be conducted according to a modification of 40\nCFR part\n60, appendix A, method 24 found at 40 CFR part 59, subpart D, appendix\nA\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). This method\nhas not been approved for methacrylate multicomponent coatings used for other\npurposes than as traffic marking coatings or for other classes of\nmulticomponent coatings. Notes\nN.Y.
