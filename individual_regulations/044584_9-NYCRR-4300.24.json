  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4300.24 - Hardware requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Cash/sell system. (1)\n\nAn authorized\npari-mutuel wagering entity shall use a cash/sell totalisator system. The\nsystem must comply with these rules regardless of the location of the central\nprocessing unit for the system. (2)\nA totalisator system must be a multi-computer or multi-processor system with\nvarying degrees of independence in the transaction processing and system\ncontrol functions distributed among the computers. At least one computer shall\nbe independent, sharing no loads or processing functions with the master\ncomputer. The computers must be configured so that if one computer actively\ntracking events fails, another computer will immediately take over all\nfunctions of the failed computer. (3)\n\nThe schematic chart, required pursuant to\nsubdivision (b) of this section must be submitted to the commission at least\ntwo weeks before the scheduled date for system installation and\ntesting. (b) Schematic\nchart. (1)\n\nThe totalisator company must\nprovide to the commission an overview of the equipment in the totalisator\nsystems in use at or by the New York facilities the company services. The\noverview must be a detailed schematic chart showing the interconnections of\neach piece of hardware. (2)\n\nThe\nchart must indicate, where appropriate, the part of the database each terminal\ncan access as well as the amount and degree of access each terminal has to the\napplication and operating system programs. User assignments must be determined\nby access, and the schematic chart must also reflect the usual and potential\nuser types assigned to each terminal. (3)\n\nIf the totalisator company desires to\nchange any component in the hardware layout, the company must revise the\nschematic chart and submit it to the commission within seven days of said\nchanges. (c) Peripherals. A totalisator system must include the following peripherals: (1)\na log printer for each computer if the\nsystem is unable to reproduce the logs upon request; (2)\na master control terminal(s) that allows\nthe operator to execute routine maintenance and operational functions based on\nindividual operator identification/authentication; (3)\nuser terminals that allow restricted\nsystem access to the stewards or racing judges allowing the order of finish to\nbe input; (4)\nwagering information\nscreen displays that meet the requirements of section\n4300.10\nof this Part (relating to\nwagering information); (5)\ndata\nstorage devices to record necessary system data; and\n(6)\nbackup devices capable of recording\ncomplete system information on removable media for storage and\nrestoration. (d) Stop\nwagering devices. (1)\n\nThe totalisator company\nshall install two separate devices that activate the stop wagering function of\nthe totalisator system in a manner consistent with stop wagering procedures\napproved by the commission. This requirement is applicable only to a host\nracetrack. (2)\n\nThe primary device\nmust be located near the stewards or racing judges, in a location approved by\nthe commission, to issue the stop wagering command during normal operations and\nactivate the \"off bell.\" This requirement is applicable only to a host\nracetrack. (3)\n\nThe secondary \"back\nup\" device must be installed in the totalisator room to allow the totalisator\noperator to issue the stop wagering command if a totalisator malfunction or\nhuman error prevents the totalisator system from activating the stop wagering\nfunction at the appropriate time. (4)\n\nThe totalisator company shall ensure that\nstop wagering occurs. (5)\n\nThe\ntotalisator company, for good reason, may request from the commission\nadditional or alternative stop wagering devices. (e) Tote board. The tote board must: (1)\nupdate the odds on each betting interest\nin the win pool at intervals of not more than 60 seconds, or at intervals\nexpressly directed by the commission; and\n(2)\nallow the stewards or racing judges or a\ndesignee of the stewards or racing judges to post the order of finish, the\nofficial sign, inquiry sign, objection sign, or dead heat sign. (f) Uninterruptible power supply\n(UPS). (1)\n\nThe computer system must be\nsupported by an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) to allow for system shutdown\nif a power failure occurs. In a system shutdown, all wagering data in the\ncomputer at the time of the failure must remain intact and all race and\nend-of-day reports must be produced. (2)\n\nThe UPS must be able to supply even power\nto the totalisator system, within accepted limits, when a power surge or drop\noccurs. (3)\n\nThe alarm associated\nwith the UPS must be readily recognizable by the totalisator operator from\ninside the totalisator room. (g) Wagering devices. (1)\nA local area network of wagering devices, also known as a cash/sell teller terminal, is not required to be intelligent, but must have an individual identity within the network. (2)\n\nThe programming of intelligent local area\nand remote wagering devices must be limited to communication with the main\ncomputer, maintenance routines, and dynamic terminal configuration\nroutines. (3)\nA program related to\nthe production or verification of the wager identification number printed on a\nmutuel ticket or assigned by the main computer may not reside in a wagering\ndevice. (4)\nA wagering device may\nnot access the wagering database except to conduct the wagering or cashing\nfunctions necessary for a teller to serve the public. (5)\nA wagering device may not be located in\nthe totalisator room or in its immediate vicinity. (h) Maintenance. A totalisator company shall\nprovide preventative maintenance to a totalisator system to ensure the system\nhardware will provide a high degree of reliability. Maintenance must include, but is not limited to, physical cleaning of system components and peripherals\nand testing the UPS for battery life and power stability. (i) Common pooling. (1)\n\nAn authorized pari-mutuel wagering entity\nshall use a totalisator system that operates in either a tote-to-tote network\nor a wagering device-to-tote network. The totalisator system must, without\nregard to the location of the CPU: (i) meet\nthe requirements of this Chapter; (ii)\ncomply with the rules; (iii)\nuse the inter-tote communication\nstandard prescribed by the commission; and\n(iv)\nuse the current version of standardized\ntrack codes recognized by the Association of Racing Commissioners International\n(ARCI) or other inter-tote communication standard prescribed by the\ncommission. (2)\n\nAn\nauthorized pari-mutuel wagering entity may common pool if all equipment used is\nof an approved type and in an approved location. (3)\n\nThe host racetrack for which a common\npool is created must also provide a totalisator system that: (i) directs each totalisator system involved\nwith the common pool regarding the pools offered, live and scratched betting\ninterest, common pool totals, network odds and probable payout, start and stop\nwagering commands, official orders of finish, deduction and payout\ncalculations; and\n(ii)\nproduces\nreports showing the amount wagered on each betting interest and pool from each\nsite, in accordance with the current inter-tote communication standard\nprescribed by the commission. (4)\nA totalisator company must file with the\ncommission the disaster recovery plan for the current operating year ensuring\nthat the authorized pari-mutuel wagering entity it provides services to may\ncontinue to conduct pari-mutuel wagering within a reasonable period of time in\nthe event of a disaster at the CPU's location. (j) Emergency procedures. (1)\n\nThe totalisator system must be supported\nby an uninterruptible power supply (UPS) as described in subdivision (f) of\nthis section. (2)\nA totalisator\ncompany must have emergency procedures to address a totalisator system failure. The procedures will apply whether the system is operating as a stand-alone\nwagering site for separate pool wagering or as a satellite in a common pool\nnetwork. (3)\n\nIf a hardware problem\noccurs, the tote operator may make an emergency fix to the totalisator system. Immediately after the fix has been made to the totalisator system, the\ntotalisator company shall file a written report with the commission that\nstates: (i) the situation that caused the need\nfor the fix; and\n(ii)\nthe\ncorrective changes the tote operator made. (k) Remote access. The totalisator company\nshall use a remote access server that records keystrokes for all users\naccessing the tote system. (l) Independent monitoring system. The totalisator company shall utilize an\nindependent real time transaction monitoring system approved by the commission. This system is to provide information in a read only format. At a minimum the\nsystem shall: (1)\nverify all transactions\nperformed by the totalisator; (2)\nprovide access to the commission and the authorized pari-mutuel wagering entity\nfor monitoring activity; (3)\nnotify\nthe authorized pari-mutuel wagering entity's mutuel manager or duly appointed\nrepresentative when the system detects a discrepancy in the totalisator\noperation and/or with the independent monitoring system automatically. The\nmutuel manager shall determine the cause of the error and make any necessary\nrepairs or adjustments pursuant to the rules and notify the commission\nimmediately after each occurrence; and\n(4)\nperform other requirements deemed\nappropriate by the commission.
