  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 11.9 - Reconnection of service, restoration of commodity supply, and conditions for ending suspension of distribution service\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Reconnection of service. This section\nsets forth procedures applicable where: only distribution service was provided\nby a utility and was disconnected or distribution service and commodity supply\nwere provided by and disconnected by the same utility. (1)\nA utility shall reconnect disconnected\nresidential service within 24 hours, unless prevented by circumstances beyond\nthe utility's control or unless a customer requests otherwise, in the following\nsituations: (i) receipt by the utility of the\nfull amount of arrears for which service was disconnected; (ii)\nagreement by the utility and the\ncustomer on a deferred payment plan and the payment of a downpayment, if\nrequired, under that plan; (iii)\nupon the direction of the commission or its designee; (iv)\nupon the receipt by the utility of a\ncommitment of a direct payment or written guarantee of payment from the social\nservices official of the social services district in which the customer\nresides; or\n(v) where a utility has\nnotice that a serious impairment to health or safety is likely to result if\nservice is not reconnected. Doubts as to whether reconnection of service is\nrequired for health or safety reasons shall be resolved in favor of\nreconnection. Comment:A utility may not insist upon payment of lawful\ncharges that did not provide the basis for disconnection before restoring\nservice under this subdivision. Similarly, under subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph, a utility may not insist on a downpayment in excess of one half the\narrears which formed the basis for the disconnection or three months' billing, whichever is less. In these circumstances, payment of other lawful charges that\ndid not form the basis for disconnection should be part of the installment\nplan, unless the customer elects to pay such charge immediately. (2)\n\nWhenever\ncircumstances beyond the utility's control prevent reconnection of service\nwithin 24 hours of any of the events specified in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, service shall be reconnected within 24 hours after those\ncircumstances cease to exist. (3)\n\nWhere any utility is required under these rules to reconnect service within 24\nhours and fails or neglects to do so without good cause as determined by the\ncommission or its designee, it shall forfeit to the customer the sum of $50 per\nday for each day or portion thereof that service is not supplied after the date\nthat service should have been supplied, in cases involving medical emergencies\n(section\n11.5\n[a]\nof this\n\nPart), the elderly, blind or disabled (section\n11.5\n[b]\nof this\n\nPart), heat-related service during cold weather periods (section\n11.5\n[c][1], [2] and\n[3]\nof this Part), or in cases where the\nutility has notice that the failure to reconnect service is likely to result in\na serious impairment to health or safety (subparagraph [1][v] of this\nsubdivision). In all other cases where the utility fails or neglects to\nreconnect service within 24 hours as required under these rules, it shall\nforfeit to the customer the sum of $25 per day for each day or portion thereof\nthat service is not supplied after the date that service should have been\nsupplied. In any case, the burden of showing good cause for any failure to\nreestablish service within 24 hours shall be upon the utility. Comment:Generally, a utility will be deemed to have met its\nburden where it demonstrates that timely reconnection was precluded by adverse\nweather conditions, serious physical impediments, health or safety\nconsiderations, new construction requirements, labor disputes, inability to\nobtain access, or legal constraints. (b) Restoration of commodity supply. This\nsubdivision sets forth procedures applicable where commodity was provided by\nand terminated by the same ESCO. (1)\n\nAn ESCO\nshall take all actions within its control and, where applicable, consistent\nwith provisions of its agreement to supply commodity, to restore terminated\nresidential service within 24 hours in the following situations: (i) receipt by the ESCO of the full amount of\narrears for which service was terminated; (ii)\nagreement by the ESCO and the customer\non a deferred payment plan and the payment of a downpayment, if required, under\nthat plan; (iii)\nupon the direction\nof the commission or its designee; (iv)\nupon the receipt by the ESCO of a\ncommitment of a direct payment or written guarantee of payment from the social\nservices official of the social services district in which the customer\nresides; or\n(v) where an ESCO has\nnotice that a serious impairment to health or safety is likely to result if\nservice is not restored. Doubts as to whether restoration of service is\nrequired for health or safety reasons shall be resolved in favor of\nrestoration. (2)\n\nWhere\nany ESCO is required under these rules to restore service within 24 hours and\nfails or neglects to do so without good cause as determined by the commission\nor its designee, it shall forfeit to the customer the sum of $50 per day for\neach day or portion thereof that service is not supplied after the date that\nservice should have been supplied, in cases involving medical emergencies\n(section\n11.5\n[a]\nof this\n\nPart), the elderly, blind or disabled (section\n11.5\n[b]\nof this\n\nPart), heat-related service during cold weather periods (section\n11.5\n[c][1], [2] and\n[3]\nof this Part), or in cases where the ESCO\nhas notice that the failure to restore service is likely to result in a serious\nimpairment to health or safety (paragraph [a][5] of this section). In all other\ncases where the ESCO fails or neglects to restore service within 24 hours as\nrequired under these rules, it shall forfeit to the customer the sum of $25 per\nday for each day or portion thereof that service is not supplied after the date\nthat service should have been supplied. In any case, the burden of showing good\ncause for any failure to reestablish service within 24 hours shall be upon the\nESCO. (c) Conditions for\nending suspension of distribution service. This subdivision sets forth the\nconditions for ending the suspension of a residential customer's distribution\nservice. Suspension of distribution service shall end upon the occurrence of\nany of the following conditions: (1)\nreceipt\nby a utility of the full amount of arrears for which service was\nterminated; (2)\nagreement by a\nutility and the customer on a deferred payment plan and the payment of a\ndownpayment, if required, under that plan; (3)\nupon the direction of the commission or\nits designee; (4)\nupon the receipt\nby a utility of a commitment of a direct payment or written guarantee in\naccordance with the Social Services Law; (5)\nwhere a utility has notice that a serious\nimpairment to health or safety is likely to result if service is not\nreconnected. Doubts as to whether reconnection of service is required for\nhealth or safety reasons shall be resolved in favor of reconnection; or\n(6)\nupon the expiration of one\nyear after such termination of commodity service, or upon the receipt of\npayments by or on behalf of the customer to the ESCO that requested the\nsuspension such that the amount paid by such customer to the ESCO plus the\namount previously paid the ESCO plus any charges paid to the distribution\nutility during the period when such customer's arrears accrued is equal to or\ngreater than the amount such customer would have paid if the entire utility\nservice had been obtained from the distribution utility during such\nperiod.
