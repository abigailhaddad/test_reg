  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 428.8 - Consultation process: exploration of feasible and prudent alternatives\n\nState Regulations\n\nTo the fullest extent possible it is the duty of every\n\nState agency to avoid or mitigate the adverse impacts of its undertakings on\neligible or registered properties. To protect these irreplaceable assets and\nmeet their legal obligations, agencies must make every effort to reconcile\ntheir programs with the public policy of the State regarding historic\npreservation by finding a feasible and prudent means to avoid or mitigate any\nadverse impact of the undertaking identified by the commissioner. To this end, the following procedures shall be followed: (a) If the commissioner determines that an\nundertaking will have an adverse impact on eligible or registered property\nrecommendations shall be formulated which the undertaking agency must consider\nwhen exploring all feasible and prudent alternatives. These recommendations\nshall accompany the notice of adverse impact given by the commissioner pursuant\nto section\n428.7. When\nappropriate, the commissioner's recommendations shall include methods and\nstandards for the curation and/or disposition of archaeological finds produced\nas a result of the undertaking. (b) Unless the agency elects to abandon the project, it shall fully explore and\ngive thorough consideration to the commissioner's recommendations and respond\nto them in writing within a reasonable time. The agency's response must specify\nif it agrees or disagrees with the commissioner's recommendations and, if it\ndisagrees, give the factual basis for its position. (c) If the agency disagrees with one of the\ncommissioner's recommendations. its response under subdivision (b) of this\nsection must also include an alternative proposal which, in the agency's\nopinion, would avoid or mitigate to the greatest extent possible the adverse\nimpacts identified by the commissioner. Any such proposal must include a\nstatement of the facts which support it. (d) In formulating recommendations or\nalternatives, both the commissioner and the undertaking agency must give\nprimary consideration to the State's historic preservation policy as expressed\nin article 14.00 of the Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Law. Other\nfactors such as cost, program needs, safety, efficiency, code requirements or\nalternate sites may also be considered. However, none of these factors standing\nalone shall be determinative of whether a particular proposal is feasible or\nprudent. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n428.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
