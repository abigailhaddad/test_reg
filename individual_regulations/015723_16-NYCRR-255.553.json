  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.553 - General requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\npressure must be increased gradually, at a rate that can be\ncontrolled. (b) Prior to the first\npressure increase and at the end of each incremental increase, the pressure\nmust be held constant while the entire segment of the pipeline that is affected\nis leakage surveyed. (c) Each\nhazardous leak detected must be repaired before a further pressure increase is\nmade. All leaks must be repaired as soon as possible following completion of\nthe upgrading. (d) Each operator\nwho upgrades a segment of pipeline shall retain for the life of the segment a\nrecord of each investigation required by this Part, of all work performed, and\nof each pressure test conducted, in connection with the upgrading. (e) Each operator who upgrades a segment of\npipeline shall establish a written procedure that will ensure compliance with\neach applicable requirement of this Part. (f) Except as provided in section\n255.555\n(c) of\nthis Part, the new maximum allowable operating pressure may not exceed the\nmaximum that would be allowed under sections 255.619 and\n255.621\nof this Part for a new\nsegment of pipeline constructed of the same materials in the same location. However, when uprating a steel pipeline, if any variable necessary to determine\nthe design pressure under the design formula (section\n255.105\nof this Part) is unknown, the MAOP may be increased as provided in section\n255.619\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.553\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
