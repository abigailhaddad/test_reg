  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 202.42 - Bifurcated trials\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Judges are encouraged to order a\nbifurcated trial of the issues of liability and damages in any action for\npersonal injury where it appears that bifurcation may assist in a clarification\nor simplification of issues and a fair and more expeditious resolution of the\naction. (b) Where a\nbifurcated trial is ordered, the issues of liability and damages shall be\nsevered and the issue of liability shall be tried first, unless the court\norders otherwise. (c) During the voir dire conducted prior to the liability phase of the trial, if\nthe damage phase of the trial is to be conducted before the same jury, counsel\nmay question the prospective jurors with respect to the issue of damages in the\nsame manner as if the trial were not bifurcated. (d) In opening to the jury on\nthe liability phase of the trial, counsel may not discuss the question of\ndamages. However, if the verdict of the jury shall be in favor of the plaintiff\non the liability issue or in favor of the defendant on any counterclaim on the\nliability issue, all parties shall then be afforded an opportunity to address\nthe jury on the question of damages before proof in that regard is presented to\nthe jury. (e) In the\nevent of a plaintiff's verdict on the issue of liability or a defendant's\nverdict on the issue of liability on a counterclaim, the damage phase of the\ntrial shall be conducted immediately thereafter before the same judge and jury, unless the judge presiding over the trial, for reasons stated in the record, finds such procedures to be impracticable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\n§\n202.42\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
