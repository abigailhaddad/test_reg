  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 575.8 - Cooperative housing corporation transfers\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1405-B\n(a) Notwithstanding the definition of\ncontrolling interest contained in section\n575.1\n(b) of this Part or anything to the contrary contained in section\n575.1\n(e)(1)\nof this Part, the real estate transfer tax applies to: (1)\nthe original conveyance of shares of\nstock in a cooperative housing corporation in connection with the grant or\ntransfer of a proprietary leasehold by the cooperative housing corporation or\ncooperative plan sponsor; and\n(2)\nthe subsequent conveyance of such stock in a cooperative housing corporation in\nconnection with the grant or transfer of a proprietary leasehold by the owner\nthereof. (b) Transfers of shares in a cooperative housing corporation pursuant to\ncontracts dated on or before February 16, 1989. Transfers of\ncooperative shares pursuant to a binding written contract\n(\ne.g. a written agreement to purchase shares) entered into on\nor before February 16, 1989 are not subject to tax (see section\n575.5\nof this Part). The fact that the real property (the building containing the\ncooperative units) was transferred on or before February 16, 1989 or that the\ncontract to transfer such property was entered into prior to such date is\nirrelevant for purposes of determining if the transfer of shares in a\ncooperative corporation are subject to tax. Also, the transfer of the real\nproperty to the cooperative housing corporation is subject to tax whether or\nnot the transfer occurred pursuant to a binding written contract entered into\non or before February 16, 1989. Example: The sponsor of a cooperative housing corporation\ntransferred a building containing ten apartments to the cooperative corporation\non January 30, 1989, and took back 100 shares of cooperative stock (the unsold\nshares as of the date of transfer to the cooperative housing corporation). As\nof February 1, 1989, the sponsor had entered into subscription agreements for\n50 shares in connection with the granting of proprietary leases to five\napartments. On March 1, 1989, the sponsor entered into subscription agreements\nfor the remaining 50 shares. However, the 100 shares were not transferred until\n\nJuly 3, 1989. The 50 shares transferred pursuant to the subscription agreements\nentered into as of February 1, 1989 would not be subject to tax. The 50 shares\ntransferred pursuant to subscription agreements entered into on March 1, 1989\nare subject to tax. (c) Credit for tax previously paid. (1)\n\nIn the case of conveyances described in\nparagraph (a)(1) of this section, a credit shall be allowed for a proportionate\npart of the amount of any tax paid upon the conveyance to the cooperative\nhousing corporation of the real property comprising the cooperative dwelling or\ndwellings to the extent that such conveyance effectuated a mere change of\nidentity of form of ownership of such property and not a change in the\nbeneficial ownership of such property. (2)\n\nThe amount of the credit is determined by\nmultiplying the amount of tax paid upon the conveyance to the cooperative\nhousing corporation by a percentage representing the extent to which such\nconveyance effectuated a mere change of identity or form of ownership and not a\nchange in the beneficial ownership of such property, and then multiplying the\nresult by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of stock\nconveyed in a transaction described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the\ndenominator of which is the total number of shares of stock of the cooperative\nhousing corporation (including any stock held by the corporation). (3)\n\nThe credit will not reduce the tax below\nzero. The credit will not be allowed for a tax paid more than 24 months prior\nto the date on which occurs the first in a series of conveyances of shares of\nstock in an offering of cooperative housing corporation shares as described in\nparagraph (a)(1) of this section. Example: The A B partnership, as sponsor, conveyed a building\ncontaining 10 apartments to cooperative housing corporation C in exchange for\nthe unsold shares of stock of C and paid real estate transfer tax of $5,000. Each of the 10 apartments in the building are allocated 5 shares of C's stock\nand, on the date of the conveyance of the building to C, the partnership sold\nshares of stock relative to two of the apartments (10 shares) which were\ntransferred directly from C to the unit purchasers, and the partnership took\nback the remaining 40 unsold shares. The transfer of the building to C is\nconsidered to constitute a 100 percent mere change of identity with no change\nin beneficial interest, since the 10 shares sold are considered to be first\ntaken back by the partnership and then sold to the unit purchasers. Therefore, the credit available to the partnership when it sells share of C is $5,000. (100 percent × $5,000.)\n(d) Information return. Every cooperative housing corporation must file an\ninformation return with the department by July 15th of each year covering the\npreceding period of January 1st through June 30th and by January 15th of each\nyear covering the preceding period of July 1st through December 31st. The first\ninformation return is due by January 15, 1990 for the period of July 1, 1989 to\n\nDecember 31, 1989. The return shall contain such information regarding the\nconveyance of shares of stock in the cooperative housing corporation as the\ndepartment may deem necessary, including but not limited to, the names, addresses and employer identification numbers or social security numbers of the\ngrantor and grantee, the number of shares conveyed, the date of the conveyance\nand the consideration paid for such conveyance.
