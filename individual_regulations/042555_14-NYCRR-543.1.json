  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 543.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Federal\n\nBrady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 (Brady Act) prohibits any person\nfrom selling or otherwise disposing of any firearm or ammunition to any person\nwho has been involuntarily \"committed to a mental institution\" (18 U.S.C. section\n922\n[d][4]) and further prohibits any\nperson who has been involuntarily \"committed to a mental institution\" from\nshipping or transporting in interstate or foreign commerce, or possessing in or\naffecting commerce, any firearm or ammunition; or receiving any firearm or\nammunition which has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign\ncommerce (18 U.S.C. section\n922\n[g][4]). (b) Under the Federal NICS Improvement\n\nAmendments Act of 2007, Public Law\n110-180, section 105, the Brady Act was\namended to establish the National Instant Criminal Background Check System\n(NICS). Upon being contacted by a Federal firearm licensee prior to\ntransferring a firearm to an unlicensed person, NICS will provide information\non whether a person is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm under\n\nState or Federal law. NICS contains records concerning certain events, such as\ncriminal convictions and mental health adjudications and findings that may\ndisqualify a person from purchasing a firearm. The 2007 amendments also require\nthe establishment of a \"certificate of relief from disabilities\" process to\npermit a person who has been or may be disqualified from possessing a firearm\npursuant to\n18\nU.S.C. section\n922(d)(4) and\n(g)(4)\nto petition for relief from that\ndisability. (c) Section 7.09 of the\n\nMental Hygiene Law authorizes the Office of Mental Health to collect, retain, modify or transmit data or records for inclusion in the NICS system for the\npurpose of responding to NICS queries regarding attempts to purchase or\notherwise take possession of firearms, as defined in\n18\nU.S.C. 921(a)(3). The\nrecords which the Office of Mental Health is authorized by law to collect, retain, modify, or transmit are expressly limited to persons who have been\ninvoluntarily committed pursuant to article 9 or 10 of the Mental Hygiene Law, article 730 or section\n330.20\nof the Criminal Procedure Law, section\n402\nor\n508\nof the\n\nCorrection Law or section\n322.2\nor\n353.4\nof the\n\nFamily Court Act. Mental Hygiene Law section 7.09 also requires the office to\npromulgate regulations establishing a \"certificate of relief from disabilities\"\nprocess for those persons whose records were provided to the Division of\n\nCriminal Justice Services or the Federal Bureau of Investigation by the office\npursuant to Mental Hygiene Law section 7.09, and who have been or may be\ndisqualified from possessing a firearm pursuant to\n18\nU.S.C. section\n922(d)(4) and\n(g)(4). (d) The purpose of these regulations is to\nestablish the required administrative \"certificate of relief from disabilities\"\nprocess for persons whose records were submitted to the NICS system by the\n\nOffice of Mental Health in accordance with section\n7.09\nof the\n\nMental Hygiene Law. (The Office of Mental Health has the authority under\nsection\n7.09\nof the\n\nMental Hygiene Law to transmit the records either directly to the NICS system\nor through the Division of Criminal Justice Services.) Such relief will be\nbased on a determination of whether the person's record and reputation are such\nthat he/she will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety\nand where granting the relief would not be contrary to the public\ninterest.
