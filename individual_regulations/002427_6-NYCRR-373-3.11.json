  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.11 - Surface impoundments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to owners and\noperators of facilities that use surface impoundments to treat, store, or\ndispose of hazardous waste, except as section\n373-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. (b) Action leakage rate. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of surface\nimpoundment units subject to paragraph (i)(1) of this section must submit a\nproposed action leakage rate to the commissioner when submitting the notice\nrequired under paragraph (i)(2) of this section. Within 60 days of receipt of\nthe notification, the commissioner will: establish an action leakage rate, either as proposed by the owner or operator or modified using the criteria in\nthis subdivision; or extend the review period for up to 30 days. If no action\nis taken by the commissioner before the original 60 or extended 90 day review\nperiod ends, the action leakage rate will be approved as proposed by the owner\nor operator. (2)\n\nThe commissioner\nshall approve an action leakage rate for surface impoundment units subject to\nparagraph (i)(1) of this section. The action leakage rate is the maximum design\nflow rate that the leak detection system (LDS) can remove without the fluid\nhead on the bottom liner exceeding one foot. The action leakage rate must\ninclude an adequate safety margin to allow for uncertainties in the design\n(\ne.g., slope, hydraulic conductivity, thickness of drainage\nmaterial), construction, operation, and location of the LDS, waste and leachate\ncharacteristics, likelihood and amounts of other sources of liquids in the LDS, and proposed response actions (\ne.g., the action leakage rate\nmust allow for decreases in the flow capacity of the system over time resulting\nfrom siltation and clogging, rib layover and creep of synthetic components of\nthe system, overburden pressures, etc.). (3)\n\nTo determine if the action leakage rate\nhas been exceeded, the owner or operator must convert the weekly or monthly\nflow rate from the monitoring data obtained under paragraph (e)(2) of this\nsection, to an average daily flow rate (gallons per acre per day) for each\nsump. Unless the commissioner approves a different calculation, the average\ndaily flow rate for each sump must be calculated weekly during the active life\nand closure period, and if the unit closes in accordance with subparagraph\n(f)(1)(ii) of this section, monthly during the post-closure care period when\nmonthly monitoring is required under paragraph (e)(2) of this\nsection. (c) Containment system. All earthen dikes must have a protective cover, such as\ngrass, shale or rock, to minimize wind and water erosion and to preserve their\nstructural integrity. (d) Waste analyses and trial tests. (1)\n\nIn addition to the waste analysis\nrequired by section\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart, whenever a surface impoundment is to be used to: (i) chemically treat a hazardous waste which\nis substantially different from waste previously treated in that impoundment; or\n(ii)\nchemically treat hazardous\nwaste with a substantially different process than any previously used in that\nimpoundment; the owner or operator must, before treating the different waste or\nusing the different process: (a) conduct\nwaste analyses and trial treatment tests (\ne.g., bench scale or\npilot plant scale tests); or\n(b) obtain written, documented information on similar treatment of similar waste\nunder similar operating conditions; to show that this treatment will comply\nwith section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. Note: As required by section\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart, the waste analysis plan must include analyses needed to comply with\nsubdivisions (g) and (h) of this section. As required by section\n373-3.5\n(c) of this\nsubpart, the owner or operator must place the results from each waste analysis\nand trial test, or the documented information, in the operating record of the\nfacility. (e) Monitoring and inspection. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator must inspect: (i) the freeboard level, at least once each\noperating day, to ensure compliance with paragraphs (i)(6) and (7) of this\nsection; and\n(ii)\nthe surface\nimpoundment, including dikes and vegetation surrounding the dike, at least once\na week, to detect any leaks, deterioration, or failures in the impoundment. Note: As required by section\n373-3.2\n(f)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart, the owner or operator must remedy any deterioration or\nmalfunction the owner or operator finds. (2)\n(i) An\nowner or operator required to have a leak detection system under paragraph\n(i)(1) of this section must record the amount of liquids removed from each leak\ndetection system sump at least once each week during the active life and\nclosure period. (ii)\n\nAfter the\nfinal cover is installed, the amount of liquid removed from each leak detection\nsystem sump must be recorded at least monthly. If the liquid level in any sump\nstays below its pump operating level for two consecutive months, the amount of\nliquid in the sump must be recorded at least quarterly. If the liquid level in\nthe sump stays below its pump operating level for two consecutive quarters, the\namount of liquid in the sump must be recorded at least semi-annually. If at any\ntime during the post-closure care period the pump operating level is exceeded\nat units on quarterly or semi-annual recording schedules, the owner or operator\nmust return to monthly recording of the amount of liquid removed from each sump\nuntil the liquid level again stays below the pump operating level for two\nconsecutive months. (iii)\n\nPump\noperating level is a liquid level proposed by the owner or operator and\napproved by the commissioner based on pump activation level, sump dimensions, and level that avoids backup into the drainage layer and minimizes head in the\nsump. The timing for submission and approval of the proposed pump operating\nlevel will be accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (f) Closure and\npost-closure care. (1)\n\nAt closure, the\nowner or operator must: (i) remove or\ndecontaminate all waste residues, contaminated containment system components\n(liners, etc.), contaminated subsoils, and structures and equipment\ncontaminated with waste and leachate, and manage them as hazardous waste unless\nsection\n371.1\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Title applies; or\n(ii)\nclose\nthe impoundment and provide post-closure care for a landfill under sections\n373-3.7 and\n373-3.14\n(d) of\nthis Subpart, including the following: (a) eliminate free liquids by removing liquid wastes or solidifying the remaining\nwastes and waste residues; (b) stabilize remaining wastes to a bearing capacity sufficient to support the\nfinal cover; and\n(c) cover the\nsurface impoundment with a final cover designed and constructed to: (1)\nprovide long-term minimization of the\nmigration of liquids through the closed impoundment; (2)\nfunction with minimum\nmaintenance; (3)\npromote drainage\nand minimize erosion or abrasion of the cover; (4)\naccommodate settling and subsidence so\nthat the cover's integrity is maintained; and\n(5)\nhave a permeability less than or equal to\nthe permeability of any bottom liner system or natural subsoils\npresent. (2)\n\nIn addition to the requirements of\nsection\n373-3.7\nand section\n373-3.14\n(d) of\nthis Subpart, during the post-closure care period, the owner or operator of a\nsurface impoundment in which wastes, waste residues, or contaminated materials\nremain after closure in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (1)(ii)\nof this subdivision must: (i) maintain the\nintegrity and effectiveness of the final cover, including making repairs to the\ncover as necessary to correct the effects of settling, subsidence, erosion, or\nother events; (ii)\nmaintain and\nmonitor the leak detection system in accordance with section\n373-2.11\n(b)(3)(ii)(d) and\n(b)(3)(iii)\nof this Part, and paragraph\n(e)(2) of this section, and comply with all other applicable leak detection\nsystem requirements of this Subpart; (iii)\nmaintain and monitor the ground-water\nmonitoring system and comply with all other applicable requirements of section\n373-3.6\nof this Subpart; and\n(iv)\nprevent run-on and runoff\nfrom eroding or otherwise damaging the final cover. (g) Special\nrequirements for ignitable or reactive waste. (1)\n\nIgnitable or reactive waste must not be\nplaced in a surface impoundment unless the waste and impoundment satisfy all\napplicable requirements of Part 376 of this Title; and\n(i) the waste is treated, rendered or mixed\nbefore or immediately after placement in the impoundment, so that: (a) the resulting waste, mixture or\ndissolution of material no longer meets the definition of ignitable or reactive\nwaste under section\n371.3\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(b) section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with; (ii)\n(a) the waste is managed in such a way that it is protected from any material or\nconditions which may cause it to ignite or react; (b) the owner or operator obtains a\ncertification from a qualified chemist or engineer that, to the best of his or\nher knowledge and opinion, the design features or operating plans of the\nfacility will prevent ignition or reaction; and\n(c) the certification and the basis for it\nare maintained at the facility; or\n(iii)\nthe surface impoundment is used solely\nfor emergencies. (h) Special requirements for\nincompatible wastes. Incompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and\nmaterials (see Appendix 29, infra, for examples) must not be\nplaced in the same surface impoundment, unless section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (i) Design and operating requirements. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of each new surface\nimpoundment unit, each lateral expansion of a surface impoundment unit, and\neach replacement of an existing surface impoundment unit must install two or\nmore liners and a leachate collection and removal system between the liners, and operate the leachate collection and removal system, in accordance with\nsection\n373-2.11\n(b)(3)\nof\nthis Part, unless exempted under section\n373-2.11\n(b)(4), (5), or (6) of this Part. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator of each unit\nreferred to in paragraph (1) of this subdivision must notify the commissioner\nat least 60 days before receiving the waste. The owner or operator of each\nfacility submitting notice must file a Part 373 permit application within six\nmonths of the commissioner's receipt of such notice. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator of any replacement\nsurface impoundment unit is exempt from paragraph (1) of this subdivision if: (i) the existing unit was constructed in\ncompliance with the design standards of section 3004(o)(1)(A)(i) and (o)(5) of\nthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle); and\n(ii)\nthere is no reason\nto believe that the liner is not functioning as designed. (4)\n\nThe double liner requirement set forth in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision may be waived by the commissioner for any\nmonofill, if: (i) the monofill contains only\nhazardous wastes from foundry furnace emission controls or metal casting\nmolding sand, and the wastes do not contain constituents which would render the\nwastes hazardous for reasons other than the toxicity characteristic in section\n371.3\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, with EPA hazardous waste numbers D004 through D017; and\n(ii)\n(a) (1)\nthe monofill has at least one liner for\nwhich there is no evidence that such liner leaking. For the purposes of this\nparagraph, the term liner means a liner designed, constructed, installed and\noperated to prevent hazardous waste from passing into the liner at any time\nduring the active life of the facility, or a liner designed, constructed, installed and operated to prevent hazardous waste from migrating beyond the\nliner to adjacent subsurface soil, ground water or surface water at any time\nduring the active life of the facility. In the case of any surface impoundment\nwhich has been exempted from the requirements of paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision on the basis of a liner designed, constructed, installed and\noperated to prevent hazardous waste from passing beyond the liner, at the\nclosure of the impoundment the owner or operator must remove or decontaminate\nall waste residues, all contaminated liner material, and contaminated soil to\nthe extent practicable. If all contaminated soil is not removed or\ndecontaminated, the owner or operator of such impoundment must comply with\nappropriate post-closure requirements, including but not limited to\nground-water monitoring and corrective action; (2)\nthe monofill is located more than\none-quarter mile from an underground source of drinking water (as that term is\ndefined in section\n370.2\n[b]\nof this\n\nTitle); and\n(3)\nthe monofill is in\ncompliance with generally applicable ground-water monitoring requirements for\nfacilities with Part 373 permits; or\n(b) the owner or operator demonstrates that\nthe monofill is located, designed and operated so as to assure that there will\nbe no migration of any hazardous constituent into ground water or surface water\nat any future time. (5)\n\nIn the case of any unit in which the\nliner and leachate collection system has been installed pursuant to the\nrequirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the commissioner, when\nissuing the first permit, will not require that a new liner or leachate\ncollection system be installed, unless the commissioner has reason to believe\nthe liner is leaking. (6)\nA surface\nimpoundment must maintain enough freeboard to prevent any overtopping of the\ndike by overfilling, wave action, or a storm. Except as provided in paragraph\n(7) of this subdivision, there must be at least 60 centimeters (two feet) of\nfreeboard. (7)\nA freeboard level\nless than 60 centimeters (two feet) may be maintained if the owner or operator\nobtains certification by a qualified engineer that alternate design features or\noperating plans will, to the best of his or her knowledge and opinion, prevent\novertopping of the dike. The certification, along with a written identification\nof alternate design features or operating plans preventing overtopping, must be\nmaintained at the facility. (8)\n\nSurface impoundments that are newly subject to RCRA section 3005(j)(1) (see\nsection\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) due to the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics for\nthe identification of hazardous waste must be in compliance with paragraphs\n(1), (3), and (4) of this subdivision not later than 48 months after the\npromulgation of the additional listing or characteristic. This compliance\nperiod shall not be cut short as the result of the promulgation of land\ndisposal prohibitions under Part 376 of this Title or the granting of an\nextension to the effective date of a prohibition pursuant to section\n376.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, within this 48-month period. (j) Containment system. All earthen dikes must have a protective cover, such as\ngrass, shale, or rock, to minimize wind and water erosion and to preserve their\nstructural integrity. (k) Response actions. (1)\n\nThe owner\nor operator of surface impoundment units subject to paragraph (i)(1) of this\nsection must develop and keep on-site, until closure of the facility, a\nresponse action plan. The response action plan must set forth the actions to be\ntaken if the action leakage rate has been exceeded. At a minimum, the response\naction plan must describe the actions specified in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nIf the flow rate\ninto the leak detection system exceeds the action leakage rate for any sump, the owner or operator must: (i) notify the\ndepartment in writing of the exceedance within seven days of the\ndetermination; (ii)\nsubmit a\npreliminary written assessment to the commissioner within 14 days of the\ndetermination, as to the amount of liquids, likely sources of liquids, possible\nlocation, size, and cause of any leaks, and short-term actions taken and\nplanned; (iii)\ndetermine to the\nextent practicable the location, size, and cause of any leak; (iv)\ndetermine whether waste receipt should\ncease or be curtailed, whether any waste should be removed from the unit for\ninspection, repairs, controls, and whether or not the unit should be\nclosed; (v) determine any other\nshort-term and longer-term actions to be taken to mitigate or stop any leaks; and\n(vi)\nwithin 30 days after the\nnotification that the action leakage rate has been exceeded, submit to the\ncommissioner the results of the analyses specified in subparagraphs (iii)-(v)\nof this paragraph, the results of actions taken, and actions planned. Monthly\nthereafter, as long as the flow rate in the leak detection system exceeds the\naction leakage rate, the owner or operator must submit to the commissioner a\nreport summarizing the results of any remedial actions taken and actions\nplanned. (3)\n\nTo make the\nleak and/or remediation determinations in subparagraphs (iii)-(v) of this\nparagraph, the owner or operator must: (i) (a) assess the source of liquids and amounts\nof liquids by source; (b) conduct a\nfingerprint, hazardous constituent, or other analyses of the liquids in the\nleak detection system to identify the source of liquids and possible location\nof any leaks, and the hazard and mobility of the liquid; and\n(c) assess the seriousness of any leaks in\nterms of potential for escaping into the environment; or\n(ii)\ndocument why such assessments are not\nneeded. (k) Air emission standards. The owner or operator shall manage all hazardous waste\nplaced in a surface impoundment in accordance with the applicable requirements\nof sections 373-3.28 and\n373-3.29\nof this\n\nSubpart.
