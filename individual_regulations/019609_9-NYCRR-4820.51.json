Pre-drawn bingo games may be conducted\nas an early bird game in which the primary and consolation prize is based on a\npercentage of the gross receipts from bingo opportunities sold pursuant to\nsection\n4820.50\nof this Part, as a\nprogressive game in which the primary prize is increased after each occasion\nthat the winning pattern is not obtained within the specified number of calls\npursuant to section\n4820.20\nof this Part, or the prizes\nmay be based on fixed primary and consolation prizes listed on the\norganization's application for license and bingo program. Each pre-drawn bingo\ngame shall be conducted as follows: (a) the number of balls to be pre-drawn shall\nbe listed on the application for bingo license and the bingo program; (b) the time that the pre-drawing of the\nballs shall commence, and the time that the game will begin, shall be specified\non the application for bingo license and on the bingo program; (c) the pre-drawing of the numbers shall\nbegin not more than 45 minutes prior to the start of the game, and shall not\nbegin unless there are a number of players equal to at least 10 percent of the\nbingo seating capacity present to verify the integrity of the pre-drawing of\nthe numbered balls; (d) the initial\nnumber of calls required to win the primary prize shall not be less than\n48; (e) an announcement shall be\nmade immediately prior to the start of the game informing all attendees of the\nmaximum number of calls required to win the primary prize and the amount of the\nconsolation prize in the event that a winning full-card pattern is not obtained\nwithin the specified number of calls. An inquiry shall then be made to\ndetermine whether or not there are any holders of winning bingo face-cards\nbased on the pre-drawn numbers appearing on the display board. If there is a\nwinner, the scheduled primary prize shall be awarded. If there is no winner, the caller shall immediately draw and announce an additional ball or balls\nuntil a winner is determined, and either a primary prize or a consolation prize\nshall be awarded, depending on the number of calls required to obtain the\nwinning full-card pattern; (f) pre-drawn bingo games shall be conducted using only commission-approved\ntear-open or sealed bingo opportunities, which shall be constructed in such a\nmanner, and of such material, so as to prevent the viewing of the numbers\nprinted thereon until the purchasing player opens the opportunity by tearing\noff perforated edges or otherwise breaking a secured seal thereon enclosing the\nface-card. All bingo opportunities used in pre-drawn games shall be marked with\nindelible ink daubers; (g) tear-open or sealed bingo opportunities shall not be exchanged, except as\notherwise permitted by section\n4820.12\nof this Part, unless the\ntear-open or sealed bingo opportunities provided in the exchange are of a\ndifferent color and series than the opportunities originally sold, and that the\nplayer exchanging an opportunity is sold two of the different colored\nopportunities for the same price as the original opportunity surrendered.

The receptacle, the caller and the assistant caller pre-drawing balls\nfrom the receptacle shall be visible to the majority of players. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
