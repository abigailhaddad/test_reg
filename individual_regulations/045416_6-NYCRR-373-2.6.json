  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.6 - Releases from solid waste management units\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n(i) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the regulations in\nthis section apply to owners and operators of facilities that treat, store or\ndispose of hazardous waste. The owner or operator must satisfy the requirements\nidentified in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph for all wastes (or\nconstituents thereof) contained in solid waste management units at the facility\nregardless of the time the waste was placed in such units. (ii)\n\nAll solid waste management units must\ncomply with the requirements in subdivision (l) of this section. A surface\nimpoundment, waste pile, land treatment unit or landfill that receives\nhazardous waste after July 26, 1982 (hereinafter referred to as a regulated\nunit) must comply with the requirements of subdivisions (b) through (k) in lieu\nof subdivision (l) for purposes of detecting, characterizing and responding to\nreleases to the uppermost aquifer. The financial responsibility requirements of\nsubdivision (l) of this section apply to regulated units. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator is not subject to\nregulations under this section if: (i) the\nowner or operator is exempted under section\n373-2.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart; (ii)\nthe owner or operator\ndesigns and operates a pile in compliance with section\n373-2.12\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart; (iii)\nthe\ncommissioner finds, pursuant to section\n373-2.13\n(h)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart, that the treatment zone of a land treatment unit that qualifies\nas a regulated unit does not contain levels of hazardous constituents that are\nabove background levels of those constituents by an amount that is\nstatistically significant, and if an unsaturated zone monitoring program\nmeeting the requirements of section\n373-2.13\n(f) of\nthis Subpart has not shown a statistically significant increase in hazardous\nconstituents below the treatment zone during the operating life of the unit. An\nexemption under this paragraph can only relieve an owner or operator of\nresponsibility to meet the requirements of this section during the post-closure\ncare period; (iv)\nthe commissioner\nfinds that there is no potential for migration of liquid from a regulated unit\nto the uppermost aquifer during the active life of the regulated unit\n(including the closure period) and the post-closure care period specified under\nsection\n373-2.7\n(g) of this\n\nSubpart. This demonstration must be certified by a qualified geologist or\ngeotechnical engineer. In order to provide an adequate margin of safety in the\nprediction of potential migration of liquid, the owner or operator must base\nany predictions made under this paragraph on assumptions that maximize the rate\nof liquid migration; or\n(v) the\ncommissioner finds that the unit: (a) is a\nstructure designed by a professional engineer registered in New York\n\nState; (b) does not receive or\ncontain liquid waste or waste containing free liquids; (c) is designed and operated to exclude\nliquid, precipitation, and other run-on and runoff; (d) has both inner and outer layers of\ncontainment enclosing the waste; (e) has a leak detection system built into\neach containment layer; (f) has a\nprogram which will provide continuing operation and maintenance of these leak\ndetection systems during the active life of the unit and the closure and\npost-closure care periods; and\n(g) to a reasonable degree of certainty, will not allow hazardous constituents to\nmigrate beyond the outer containment layer prior to the end of the post-closure\ncare period. (3)\n\nThe regulations under this section apply\nduring the active life of the regulated unit (including the closure period). After closure of the regulated unit, the regulations in this section: (i) do not apply if all waste, waste\nresidues, contaminated containment system components and contaminated subsoils\nare removed or decontaminated at closure; (ii)\napply during the post-closure care\nperiod under section\n373-2.7\n(g) of this\n\nSubpart if the owner or operator is conducting a detection monitoring program\nunder subdivision (i) of this section; or\n(iii)\napply during the compliance period\nunder subdivision (g) of this section if the owner or operator is conducting a\ncompliance monitoring program under subdivision (j) or a corrective action\nprogram under subdivision (k). (4)\n\nRegulations in this Subpart may apply to\nmiscellaneous units when necessary to comply with section\n373-2.24\n(b), (c) and\n(d) of this Subpart. (5)\n\nThe regulations of this section apply to\nall owners and operators subject to the requirements of section\n373-1.2\n(e)(3)\nof\nthis Part, when the department issues either a post-closure permit or an\nenforceable document (as defined in section\n373-1.2\n[e][3]\nof\nthis Part), at the facility. When the department issues an enforceable\ndocument, references in this section to in the permit mean in the enforceable\ndocument. (6)\n\nThe department may\nreplace all or part of the requirements of subdivisions (b) through (k) of this\nsection applying to a regulated unit with alternative requirements for\ngroundwater monitoring and corrective action for releases to groundwater set\nout in the permit (or in an enforceable document) (as defined in section\n373-1.2\n[e][3]\nof\nthis Part) where the department determines that: (i) the regulated unit is situated among\nsolid waste management units (or areas of concern), a release has occurred, and\nboth the regulated unit and one or more solid waste management unit(s) (or\nareas of concern) are likely to have contributed to the release; and\n(ii)\nit is not necessary to apply the\ngroundwater monitoring and corrective action requirements of subdivisions (b)\nthrough (k) of this section because alternative requirements will protect human\nhealth and the environment. (b) Required programs. (1)\n\nOwners and operators subject to this\nsection must conduct a monitoring and response program as follows: (i) Whenever hazardous constituents under\nsubdivision (d) of this section from a regulated unit are detected at the\ncompliance point under subdivision (f), the owner or operator must institute a\ncompliance monitoring program under subdivision (j). Detected\nis defined as statistically significant evidence of contamination as described\nin paragraph (i)(7) of this section. (ii)\n\nWhenever the ground-water protection\nstandard under subdivision (c) of this section is exceeded, the owner or\noperator must institute a corrective action program under subdivision (k). Exceeded\nis defined as statistically significant evidence of\nincreased contamination as described in paragraph (j)(8) of this\nsection. (iii)\n\nWhenever hazardous\nconstituents under subdivision (d) of this section from a regulated unit exceed\nconcentration limits under subdivision (e) in ground water between the\ncompliance point under subdivision (f) and the downgradient facility property\nboundary, the owner or operator must institute a corrective action program\nunder subdivision (k). (iv)\n\nIn all\nother cases, the owner or operator must institute a detection monitoring\nprogram under subdivision (i) of this section. (2)\n\nThe commissioner will specify in the\nfacility permit the specific elements of the monitoring and response program. The commissioner may include one or more of the programs identified in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision in the facility permit as may be necessary to\nprotect human health and the environment, and will specify the circumstances\nunder which each of the programs will be required. In deciding whether to\nrequire the owner or operator to be prepared to institute a particular program, the commissioner will consider the potential adverse effects on human health\nand the environment that might occur before final administrative action on a\npermit modification application to incorporate such a program could be\ntaken. (c) Ground-water protection standard. The owner or operator must comply with conditions\nspecified in the facility permit that are designed to ensure that hazardous\nconstituents under subdivision (d) of this section detected in the ground water\nfrom a regulated unit do not exceed the concentration limits under subdivision\n(e) in the uppermost aquifer underlying the waste management area beyond the\npoint of compliance under subdivision (f) during the compliance period under\nsubdivision (g). The commissioner will establish this ground-water protection\nstandard in the facility permit when hazardous constituents have been detected\nin the groundwater. (d) Hazardous constituents. (1)\n\nThe\ncommissioner will specify in the facility permit the hazardous constituents to\nwhich the ground-water protection standard of subdivision (c) of this section\napplies. Hazardous constituents are constituents identified in Appendix 23, infra, that have been detected in ground water in the\nuppermost aquifer underlying a regulated unit, and that are reasonably expected\nto be in or derived from waste contained in a regulated unit, unless the\ncommissioner has excluded them under paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nThe commissioner\nwill exclude an Appendix 23 constituent from the list of hazardous constituents\nspecified in the facility permit if the commissioner finds that the constituent\nis not capable of posing a substantial present or potential hazard to human\nhealth or the environment. In deciding whether to grant an exemption, the\ncommissioner will consider the following: (i) potential adverse effects on ground-water quality, considering: (a) the physical and chemical characteristics\nof the waste in the regulated unit, including its potential for\nmigration; (b) the hydrogeological\ncharacteristics of the facility and surrounding land; (c) the quantity of ground water and the\ndirection of ground-water flow; (d) the proximity and withdrawal rates of ground-water users; (e) the current and future uses of ground\nwater in the area and any quality standards established for those ground\nwaters; (f) the existing quality of\nground water, including other sources of contamination and their cumulative\nimpact on the ground-water quality; (g) the potential for health risks caused by\nhuman exposure to waste constituents; (h) the potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents; and\n(i) the persistence and permanence of the\npotential adverse effects; and\n(ii)\npotential adverse effects on hydraulically connected surface-water quality, considering: (a) the volume and physical and\nchemical characteristics of the waste in the regulated unit; (b) the hydrogeological characteristics of\nthe facility and surrounding land; (c) the quantity and quality of ground water, and the direction of ground-water flow; (d) the patterns of rainfall in the\nregion; (e) the proximity of the\nregulated unit to surface waters; (f) the current and future uses of surface\nwaters in the area and any water quality standards established for those\nsurface waters; (g) the existing\nquality of surface water, including other sources of contamination and the\ncumulative impact on surface-water quality; (h) the potential for health risks caused by\nhuman exposure to waste constituents; (i) the potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents; and\n(j) the persistence and\npermanence of the potential adverse effects. (3)\n\nIn making any\ndetermination under paragraph (2) of this subdivision about the use of ground\nwater in the area around the facility, the commissioner will consider any\nidentification of underground sources of drinking water and exempted aquifers\nmade under\n40 CFR\n144.8\n(see section 370.1[e] of this\n\nTitle). (e) Concentration limits. (1)\n\nThe\ncommissioner will specify in the facility permit concentration limits in the\nground water for hazardous constituents established under subdivision (d) of\nthis section. The concentration of a hazardous constituent: (i) must not exceed the background level of\nthat constituent in the ground water at the time that limit is specified in the\npermit; or\n(ii)\nfor any of the\nconstituents listed in Table 1, must not exceed the respective value given in\nthat table if the background level of the constituent is below the value given\nin Table 1; or\n(iii)\nmust not\nexceed an alternate limit established by the commissioner under paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision. TABLE 1\nMAXIMUM CONCENTRATION OF CONSTITUENTS FOR\nGROUND-WATER PROTECTION\nMaximum\n\nConstituent\n\nConcentration\n(mg/l)\n\nArsenic\n0.025\n\nBarium\n1.0\n\nCadmium\n0.01\n\nChromium\n0.05\n\nLead\n0.025\n\nMercury\n0.002\n\nSelenium\n0.01\n\nSilver\n0.05\n\nEndrin (1,2,3,4,10,10-hexachloro-1, 7-epoxy-1, 4, 4a, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9a- octahydro-1, 4-endo, endo-5, 8-dimethano naphthalene)\n\nNot detectable*\nLindane (1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane, gamma\nisomer)\n\nNot detectable*\nMethoxychlor [1,1,1-Trichloro-2, 2-bis\n(p-methoxy-phenylethane)]\n0.035\n\nToxaphene (C10 Hl0 C6, Technical chlorinated\ncamphene, 67-69 percent chlorine)\n\nNot detectable*\n2, 4-D (2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid)\n0.0044\n2,4,5-TP Silvex (2,4,5 Trichlorophenoxypropionic\nacid)\n0.00026\n\nNote: Not detectable\nmeans any test or\nanalytical determination referenced in section\n703.4\nof this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nThe\ncommissioner will establish an alternate concentration limit for a hazardous\nconstituent if the commissioner finds that the constituent will not pose a\nsubstantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment as\nlong as the alternate concentration limit is not exceeded. In establishing\nalternate concentration limits, the commissioner will consider the following\nfactors: (i) potential adverse effects on\nground-water quality, considering: (a) the\nphysical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the regulated unit, including its potential for migration; (b) the hydrogeological characteristics of\nthe facility and surrounding land; (c) the quantity of ground water and the\ndirection of ground-water flow; (d) the proximity and withdrawal rates of ground-water users; (e) the current and future uses of ground\nwater in the area and any water quality standards established for those ground\nwaters; (f) the existing quality of\nground water, including other sources of contamination and their cumulative\nimpact on the ground-water quality; (g) the potential for health risks caused by\nhuman exposure to waste constituents; (h) the potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents; and\n(i) the persistence and permanence of the\npotential adverse effects; and\n(ii)\npotential adverse effects on hydraulically connected surface-water quality, considering: (a) the volume and physical and\nchemical characteristics of the waste in the regulated unit; (b) the hydrogeological characteristics of\nthe facility and surrounding land; (c) the quantity and quality of ground water, and the direction of ground-water flow; (d) the patterns of rainfall in the\nregion; (e) the proximity of the\nregulated unit to surface waters; (f) the current and future uses of surface\nwaters in the area and any water quality standards established for those\nsurface waters; (g) the existing\nquality of surface water, including other sources of contamination and the\ncumulative impact on surface-water quality; (h) the potential for health risks caused by\nhuman exposure to waste constituents; (i) the potential damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation and physical structures caused by exposure to waste constituents; and\n(j) the persistence and\npermanence of the potential adverse effects. (3)\n\nIn making any\ndetermination under paragraph (2) of this subdivision about the use of ground\nwater in the area around the facility, the commissioner will consider any\nidentification of underground sources of drinking water and exempted aquifers\nmade under\n40 CFR\n144.8\n(see section 370.1[e] of this Title). (f) Point of\ncompliance. (1)\n\nThe commissioner will\nspecify in the facility permit the point of compliance at which the\nground-water protection standard of subdivision (c) of this section applies, and at which monitoring must be conducted. The point of compliance is a\nvertical surface located at the hydraulically downgradient limit of the waste\nmanagement area that extends down into the uppermost aquifer underlying the\nregulated units. (2)\n\nThe waste\nmanagement area is the limit projected in the horizontal plane of the area on\nwhich waste will be placed during the active life of a regulated unit. (i) The waste management area includes\nhorizontal space taken up by any liner, dike or other barrier designed to\ncontain waste in a regulated unit. (ii)\n\nIf the facility contains more than one\nregulated unit, the waste management area is described by an imaginary line\ncircumscribing the several regulated units. (g) Compliance period. (1)\n\nThe commissioner will specify in the\nfacility permit the compliance period during which the ground-water protection\nstandard of subdivision (c) of this section applies. The compliance period is\nthe number of years equal to the active life of the waste management area\n(including any waste management activity prior to permitting) and the closure\nperiod. (2)\n\nThe compliance period\nbegins when the owner or operator initiates a compliance monitoring program\nmeeting the requirements of subdivision (j) of this section. (3)\n\nIf the owner or operator is engaged in a\ncorrective action program at the end of the compliance period specified in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, the compliance period is extended until the\nowner or operator can demonstrate that the ground-water protection standard of\nsubdivision (c) of this section has not been exceeded for a period of three\nconsecutive years. (h) General groundwater monitoring requirements. The owner or operator must comply with the following\nrequirements for any groundwater monitoring program developed to satisfy\nsubdivision (i), (j) or (k) of this section: (1)\n\nThe groundwater monitoring system must\nconsist of a sufficient number of wells, installed at appropriate locations and\ndepths to yield groundwater samples from the uppermost aquifer that: (i) represent the quality of background\ngroundwater that has not been affected by leakage from a regulated unit; (a) a determination of background groundwater\nquality may include sampling of wells that are not hydraulically upgradient of\nthe waste management area where: (1)\nhydrogeologic conditions do not allow the owner or operator to determine what\nwells are hydraulically upgradient; and\n(2)\nsampling at other wells will provide an\nindication of background ground-water quality that is representative or more\nrepresentative than that provided by the upgradient wells; and\n(ii)\nrepresent the\nquality of groundwater passing the point of compliance; and\n(iii)\nallow for the detection of\ncontamination when hazardous waste or hazardous constituents have migrated from\nthe waste management area to the uppermost aquifer. (2)\n\nIf a facility contains more than one\nregulated unit, separate ground-water monitoring systems are not required for\neach regulated unit, provided that provisions for sampling the ground water in\nthe uppermost aquifer will enable detection and measurement at the compliance\npoint of hazardous constituents from the regulated units that have entered the\nground water in the uppermost aquifer. The commissioner may require separate\nmonitoring systems for separate waste management components. (3)\n\nAll monitoring wells must be cased in a\nmanner that maintains the integrity of the monitoring-well bore hole. This\ncasing must be screened or perforated and packed with gravel or sand, where\nnecessary, to enable collection of ground-water samples. The annular space\n(\ni.e., the space between the bore hole and well casing) above\nthe sampling depth must be sealed to prevent contamination of samples and the\nground water. (4)\n\nThe ground-water\nmonitoring program must include consistent sampling and analysis procedures\nthat are designed to ensure monitoring results that provide a reliable\nindication of ground-water quality below the waste management area. At a\nminimum, the program must include procedures and techniques for: (i) sample collection; (ii)\nsample preservation and\nshipment; (iii)\nanalytical\nprocedures; and\n(iv)\nchain of\ncustody control. (5)\n\nThe\nground-water monitoring program must include sampling and analytical methods\nthat are appropriate for ground-water sampling and that accurately measure\nhazardous constituents in ground-water samples. (6)\n\nThe ground-water monitoring program must\ninclude a determination of the ground-water surface elevation each time ground\nwater is sampled. (7)\n\nIn detection\nmonitoring or where appropriate in compliance monitoring, data on each\nhazardous constituent specified in the permit will be collected from background\nwells and wells at the compliance point(s). The number and kinds of samples\ncollected to establish background shall be appropriate for the form of\nstatistical test employed, following generally accepted statistical principles. The sample size shall be as large as necessary to ensure with reasonable\nconfidence that a contaminant release to groundwater from a facility will be\ndetected. The owner or operator will determine an appropriate sampling\nprocedure and interval for each hazardous constituent listed in the facility\npermit which shall be specified in the unit permit upon approval by the\ncommissioner. This sampling procedure shall be: (i) a sequence of at least four samples, taken at an interval that assures, to the greatest extent technically feasible, that an independent sample is obtained, by reference to the uppermost aquifer's\neffective porosity, hydraulic conductivity, and hydraulic gradient, and the\nfate and transport characteristics of the potential contaminants; or\n(ii)\nan alternate sampling procedure proposed\nby the owner or operator and approved by the commissioner; or\n(iii)\nin developing the data base used to\ndetermine a background value for each parameter or constituent, the owner or\noperator must take a minimum of one sample from each well and a minimum of four\nsamples from the entire system used to determine background ground-water\nquality, each time the system is sampled. (8)\n\nThe owner or operator will specify one of\nthe following statistical methods to be used in evaluating groundwater\nmonitoring data for each hazardous constituent which, upon approval by the\ncommissioner, will be specified in the unit permit. The statistical test chosen\nshall be conducted separately for each hazardous constituent in each well. Where practical quantification limits (pql's) are used in any of the following\nstatistical procedures to comply with subparagraph (9)(v) of this subdivision, the pql must be proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the\ncommissioner. Use of any of the following statistical methods must be\nprotective of human health and the environment and must comply with the\nperformance standards outlined in paragraph (9) of this subdivision. (i) A parametric analysis of variance (ANOVA)\nfollowed by multiple comparisons procedures to identify statistically\nsignificant evidence of contamination. The method must include estimation and\ntesting of the contrasts between each compliance well's mean and the background\nmean levels for each constituent. (ii)\n\nAn analysis of variance (ANOVA) based on\nranks followed by multiple comparisons procedures to identify statistically\nsignificant evidence of contamination. The method must include estimation and\ntesting of the contrasts between each compliance well's median and the\nbackground median levels for each constituent. (iii)\nA tolerance or prediction interval\nprocedure in which an interval for each constituent is established from the\ndistribution of the background data, and the level of each constituent in each\ncompliance well is compared to the upper tolerance or prediction\nlimit. (iv)\nA control chart\napproach that gives control limits for each constituent. (v) Another statistical test method submitted\nby the owner or operator and approved by the commissioner. (9)\n\nAny statistical method chosen under\nparagraph (8) of this subdivision for specification in the unit permit shall\ncomply with the following performance standards, as appropriate: (i) The statistical method used to evaluate\nground-water monitoring data shall be appropriate for the distribution of\nchemical parameters or hazardous constituents. If the distribution of the\nchemical parameters or hazardous constituents is shown by the owner or operator\nto be inappropriate for a normal theory test, then the data should be\ntransformed or a distribution-free theory test should be used. If the\ndistributions for the constituents differ, more than one statistical method may\nbe needed. (ii)\n\nIf an individual\nwell comparison procedure is used to compare an individual compliance well\nconstituent concentration with background constituent concentrations or a\nground-water protection standard, the test shall be done at a Type I error\nlevel no less than 0.01 for each testing period. If a multiple comparisons\nprocedure is used, the Type I experimentwise error rate for each testing period\nshall be no less than 0.05; however, the Type I error of no less than 0.01 for\nindividual well comparisons must be maintained. This performance standard does\nnot apply to tolerance intervals, prediction intervals or control\ncharts. (iii)\n\nIf a control chart\napproach is used to evaluate ground-water monitoring data, the specific type of\ncontrol chart and its associated parameter values shall be proposed by the\nowner or operator and approved by the commissioner if he or she finds it to be\nprotective of human health and the environment. (iv)\n\nIf a tolerance interval or a prediction\ninterval is used to evaluate ground-water monitoring data, the levels of\nconfidence and, for tolerance intervals, the percentage of the population that\nthe interval must contain, shall be proposed by the owner or operator and\napproved by the commissioner if he or she finds these parameters to be\nprotective of human health and the environment. These parameters will be\ndetermined after considering the number of samples in the background data base, the data distribution, and the range of the concentration values for each\nconstituent of concern. (v) The\nstatistical method shall account for data below the limit of detection with one\nor more statistical procedures that are protective of human health and the\nenvironment. Any practical quantification limit (pql) approved by the\ncommissioner under paragraph (8) of this subdivision that is used in the\nstatistical method shall be the lowest concentration level that can be reliably\nachieved within specified limits of precision and accuracy during routine\nlaboratory operating conditions that are available to the facility. (vi)\n\nIf necessary, the statistical method\nshall include procedures to control or correct for seasonal and spatial\nvariability as well as temporal correlation in the data. (10)\n\nGround-water monitoring data collected\nin accordance with paragraph (7) of this subdivision including actual levels of\nconstituents must be maintained in the facility operating record. The\ncommissioner will specify in the permit when the data must be submitted for\nreview. (i) Detection monitoring program. An owner or operator required to establish a detection\nmonitoring program under this section must, at a minimum, discharge the\nfollowing responsibilities: (1)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must monitor for indicator parameters (\ne.g., specific conductance, total organic carbon or total organic halogen waste\nconstituents, or reaction products that provide a reliable indication of the\npresence of hazardous constituents in groundwater. The department will specify\nthe parameters or constituents to be monitored in the facility permit, after\nconsidering the following factors: (i) the\ntypes, quantities and concentrations of constituents in wastes managed at the\nregulated unit; (ii)\nthe mobility, stability and persistence of waste constituents or their reaction products in\nthe unsaturated zone beneath the waste management area; (iii)\nthe detectability of indicator\nparameters, waste constituents and reaction products in ground water; and\n(iv)\nthe concentrations or\nvalues and coefficients of variation of proposed monitoring parameters or\nconstituents in the ground-water background. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator must install a\nground-water monitoring system at the compliance point as specified under\nsubdivision (f) of this section. The ground-water monitoring system must comply\nwith subparagraph (h)(1)(ii), and paragraphs (h)(2)-(3) of this\nsection. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator\nmust conduct a ground-water monitoring program for each chemical parameter and\nhazardous constituent specified in the permit pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision in accordance with paragraph (h)(7) of this section. The owner or\noperator must maintain a record of ground-water analytical data as measured and\nin a form necessary for the determination of statistical significance under\nparagraph (h)(8) of this section. (4)\n\nThe department will specify the\nfrequencies for collecting samples and conducting statistical tests to\ndetermine whether there is statistically significant evidence of contamination\nfor any parameter or hazardous constituent specified in the permit under\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision in accordance with paragraph (h)(7) of this\nsection. (5)\n\nThe owner or operator\nmust determine the ground-water flow rate and direction in the uppermost\naquifer at least annually. (6)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must use procedures and methods for sampling and analysis\nthat meet the requirements of paragraphs (h)(4)-(5) of this section. (7)\n\nThe owner or operator must determine\nwhether there is statistically significant evidence of contamination for any\nchemical parameter or hazardous constituent specified in the permit pursuant to\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision at a frequency specified under paragraph (4)\nof this subdivision. (i) In determining\nwhether statistically significant evidence of contamination exists, the owner\nor operator must use the method(s) specified in the permit under paragraph\n(h)(8) of this section. These method(s) must compare data collected at the\ncompliance point(s) to the background ground-water quality data. (ii)\n\nThe owner or operator must determine\nwhether there is statistically significant evidence of contamination at each\nmonitoring well at the compliance point within a reasonable time period after\ncompletion of sampling. The commissioner will specify that time period in the\nfacility permit, after considering the complexity of the statistical test and\nthe availability of laboratory facilities to perform the analysis of\nground-water samples. (8)\n\nIf the owner or operator determines, pursuant to paragraph (7) of this subdivision, that there is statistically\nsignificant evidence of contamination for chemical parameters or hazardous\nconstituents specified pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision at any\nmonitoring well at the compliance point, he or she must: (i) notify the commissioner of this finding\nin writing within seven days. The notification must indicate what chemical\nparameters or hazardous constituents have shown statistically significant\nevidence of contamination; (ii)\nimmediately sample the groundwater in all monitoring wells at the compliance\npoint and determine whether constituents in the list of Appendix 33 of this\n\nTitle are present and, if so, at what concentration. However, the department, on a discretionary basis, may allow sampling for a site-specific subset of\nconstituents from the Appendix 33 list of this part and other\nrepresentative/related waste constituents; (iii)\nfor any Appendix 33 compounds found in\nthe analysis pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, the owner or\noperator may resample within one month or at an alternative site-specific\nschedule approved by the department and repeat the analysis for those compounds\ndetected. If the results of the second analysis confirm the initial results, then these constituents will form the basis for compliance monitoring. If the\nowner or operator does not resample for the compounds in subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph, the hazardous constituents found during this initial Appendix\n33 analysis will form the basis for compliance monitoring. (iv)\nwithin 90 days, submit to the\ncommissioner an application for a permit modification to establish a compliance\nmonitoring program meeting the requirements of subdivision (j) of this section. The application must include the following information: (a) an identification of the concentration of\nany Appendix 33 constituent detected in the ground water at each monitoring\nwell at the compliance point; (b) any proposed changes to the ground-water monitoring system at the facility\nnecessary to meet the requirements of subdivision (j) of this\nsection; (c) any proposed additions\nor changes to the monitoring frequency, sampling and analysis procedures or\nmethods, or statistical methods used at the facility necessary to meet the\nrequirements of subdivision (j) of this section; (d) for each hazardous constituent detected\nat the compliance point, a proposed concentration limit under subparagraph\n(e)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section, or a notice of intent to seek an alternate\nconcentration limit under paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and\n(v) within 180 days, submit to the\ncommissioner: (a) all data necessary to\njustify an alternate concentration limit sought under paragraph (e)(2) of this\nsection; and\n(b) an engineering\nfeasibility plan for a corrective action program necessary to meet the\nrequirements of subdivision (k) of this section, unless: (1)\nall hazardous constituents identified\nunder subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph are listed in Table 1 in subdivision\n(e) of this section and their concentrations do not exceed the respective\nvalues given in that Table; or\n(2)\nthe owner or operator has sought an alternate concentration limit under\nparagraph (e)(2) of this section for every hazardous constituent identified\nunder subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (9)\n\nIf the owner or operator\ndetermines, pursuant to paragraph (7) of this subdivision, that there is a\nstatistically significant difference for chemical parameters or hazardous\nconstituents specified pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision at any\nmonitoring well at the compliance point, he or she may demonstrate that a\nsource other than a regulated unit caused the contamination or that the\ndetection is an artifact caused by an error in sampling, analysis, or\nstatistical evaluation or natural variation in the groundwater. While the owner\nor operator may make a demonstration under this paragraph in addition to, or in\nlieu of, submitting a permit modification application under subparagraph\n(8)(iv) of this subdivision, the owner or operator is not relieved of the\nrequirement to submit a permit modification application within the time\nspecified in subparagraph (8)(iv) of this subdivision unless the demonstration\nmade under this paragraph successfully shows that a source other than a\nregulated unit caused the increase, or that the increase resulted from error in\nsampling, analysis or evaluation. In making a demonstration under this\nparagraph, the owner or operator must: (i) notify the commissioner in writing, within seven days of determining\nstatistically significant evidence of contamination at the compliance point, that he or she intends to make a demonstration under this paragraph; (ii)\nwithin 90 days, submit a report to the\ncommissioner which demonstrates that a source other than a regulated unit\ncaused the contamination, or that the contamination resulted from error in\nsampling, analysis or evaluation; (iii)\nwithin 90 days, submit to the\ncommissioner an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate\nchanges to the detection monitoring program at the facility; and\n(iv)\ncontinue to monitor in accordance with\nthe detection monitoring program established under this section. (10)\n\nIf the owner or operator\ndetermines that the detection monitoring program no longer satisfies the\nrequirements of this section, he or she must, within 90 days, submit an\napplication for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes to the\nprogram. (j) Compliance monitoring program. An owner or operator required to establish a compliance\nmonitoring program under this section must, at a minimum, discharge the\nfollowing responsibilities: (1)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must monitor the ground water to determine whether regulated\nunits are in compliance with the ground-water protection standard under\nsubdivision (c) of this section. The commissioner will specify the ground-water\nprotection standard in the facility permit, including: (i) a list of the hazardous constituents\nidentified under subdivision (d) of this section; (ii)\nconcentration limits under subdivision\n(e) for each of those hazardous constituents; (iii)\nthe compliance point under subdivision\n(f); and\n(iv)\nthe compliance period\nunder subdivision (g). (2)\n\nThe owner or operator must install a\nground-water monitoring system at the compliance point as specified under\nsubdivision (f) of this section. The ground-water monitoring system must comply\nwith subparagraph (h)(1)(ii) and paragraphs (h)(2)-(3) of this\nsection. (3)\n\nThe commissioner will\nspecify the sampling procedures and statistical methods appropriate for the\nconstituents and the facility, consistent with paragraphs (h)(7) and (8) of\nthis section. (i) The owner or operator must\nconduct a sampling program for each chemical parameter or hazardous constituent\nin accordance with paragraph (h)(7) of this section. (ii)\n\nThe owner or operator must record\nground-water analytical data as measured and in the form necessary for the\ndetermination of statistical significance under paragraph (h)(8) of this\nsection for the compliance period of the facility. (4)\n\nThe owner or operator must determine the\nground-water flow rate and direction in the uppermost aquifer at least\nannually. (5)\n\nThe department will\nspecify the frequencies for collecting samples and conducting statistical tests\nto determine statistically significant evidence of increased contamination in\naccordance with paragraph (h)(7) of this section. (6)\n\nAnnually, the owner or operator must\ndetermine whether additional hazardous constituents from Appendix 33, which\ncould possibly be site-related compounds, but are not on the detection\nmonitoring list in the permit, are actually present in the uppermost aquifer\nand, if so, at what concentration pursuant to procedures in paragraph (i)(7) of\nthis section. To accomplish this, the owner or operator must consult with the\ndepartment. The department will determine on a case-by-case basis: which sample\ncollection event during the year will involve enhanced sampling; the number of\nmonitoring wells at the compliance point to undergo enhanced sampling; the\nnumber of samples to be collected from each of these monitoring wells; and, the\nspecific constituents from Appendix 33 of this Title for which these samples\nmust be analyzed. If the enhanced sampling event indicates that Appendix 33\nconstituents are present in the groundwater that are not already identified in\nthe permit as monitoring constituents, the owner or operator may resample\nwithin one month or at an alternative site-specific schedule approved by the\ndepartment, and repeat the analysis. If the second analysis confirms the\npresence of new constituents, the owner or operator must report the\nconcentration of these additional constituents to the department within seven\ndays after completion of the second analysis and add them to the monitoring\nlist. If the owner or operator chooses not to resample, then he or she must\nreport the concentrations of these additional constituents to the department\nwithin seven days after completion of the initial analysis and add them to the\nmonitoring list. Notwithstanding the above reporting requirements, any other\napplicable statutory and regulatory reporting requirements apply. (7)\n\nThe owner or operator must use procedures\nand methods for sampling and analysis that meet the requirements of paragraphs\n(h)(4)-(5) of this section. (8)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must determine whether there is statistically significant\nevidence of increased contamination for any chemical parameter or hazardous\nconstituent specified in the permit, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, at a frequency specified under paragraph (5) of this subdivision. (i) In determining whether statistically\nsignificant evidence of increased contamination exists, the owner or operator\nmust use the method(s) specified in the permit under paragraph (h)(8) of this\nsection. The method(s) must compare data collected at the compliance point(s)\nto the concentration limit for that constituent developed in accordance with\nsubdivision (e) of this section. (ii)\n\nThe owner or operator must determine\nwhether there is statistically significant evidence of increased contamination\nat each monitoring well at the compliance point, within a reasonable time\nperiod after completion of sampling. The commissioner will specify that time\nperiod in the facility permit, after considering the complexity of the\nstatistical test and the availability of laboratory facilities to perform the\nanalysis of ground-water samples. (9)\n\nIf the owner or operator determines, pursuant to paragraph (8) of this subdivision, that any concentration limits\nunder subdivision (e) of this section are being exceeded at any monitoring well\nat the point of compliance, he or she must: (i) notify the commissioner of this finding\nin writing within seven days. The notification must indicate what concentration\nlimits have been exceeded; and\n(ii)\nsubmit to the commissioner an application for a permit modification to\nestablish a corrective action program meeting the requirements of subdivision\n(k) of this section within 180 days, or within 90 days if an engineering\nfeasibility study has been previously submitted to the commissioner under\nsubparagraph (i)(8)(v) of this section. The application must, at a minimum, include the following information: (a) a\ndetailed description of corrective actions that will achieve compliance with\nthe ground-water protection standard specified in the permit under paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision; and\n(b) a\nplan for a ground-water monitoring program that will demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the corrective action. Such a ground-water monitoring program\nmay be based on a compliance monitoring program developed to meet the\nrequirements of this section. (10)\n\nIf the owner or operator determines, pursuant to paragraph (8) of this subdivision, that the ground-water\nconcentration limits under this section are being exceeded at any monitoring\nwell at the point of compliance, he or she may demonstrate that a source other\nthan a regulated unit caused the contamination or that the detection is an\nartifact caused by an error in sampling, analysis or statistical evaluation or\nnatural variation in the ground water. In making a demonstration under this\nparagraph, the owner or operator must: (i) notify the commissioner in writing, within seven days, that he or she intends\nto make a demonstration under this paragraph; (ii)\nwithin 90 days, submit a report to the\ncommissioner which demonstrates that a source other than a regulated unit\ncaused the standard to be exceeded or that the apparent noncompliance with the\nstandards resulted from error in sampling, analysis or evaluation; (iii)\nwithin 90 days, submit to the\ncommissioner an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate\nchanges to the compliance monitoring program at the facility; and\n(iv)\ncontinue to monitor in accordance with\nthe compliance monitoring program established under this section. (11)\n\nIf the owner or operator\ndetermines that the compliance monitoring program no longer satisfies the\nrequirements of this section, the owner or operator must, within 90 days, submit an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes\nto the program. (k) Corrective action program. An owner or operator required to establish a corrective\naction program under this section must, at a minimum, do the following: (1)\n\nThe owner or operator must take\ncorrective action to ensure that regulated units are in compliance with the\nground-water protection standard under subdivision (c) of this section. The\ncommissioner will specify the ground-water protection standard in the facility\npermit, including: (i) a list of the\nhazardous constituents identified under subdivision (d) of this\nsection; (ii)\nconcentration limits\nunder subdivision (e) for each of those hazardous constituents; (iii)\nthe compliance point under subdivision\n(f); and\n(iv)\nthe compliance period\nunder subdivision (g). (2)\n\nThe owner or operator must implement a\ncorrective action program that prevents hazardous constituents from exceeding\ntheir respective concentration limits at the compliance point by removing the\nhazardous waste constituents or treating them in place. The permit will specify\nthe specific measures that will be taken. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator must begin\ncorrective action within a reasonable time period after the ground-water\nprotection standard is exceeded. The commissioner will specify that time period\nin the facility permit. If a facility permit includes a corrective action\nprogram in addition to a compliance monitoring program, the permit will specify\nwhen the corrective action will begin and such a requirement will operate in\nlieu of subparagraph (j)(9)(ii) of this section. (4)\n\nIn conjunction with a corrective action\nprogram, the owner or operator must establish and implement a ground-water\nmonitoring program to demonstrate the effectiveness of the corrective action\nprogram. Such a monitoring program may be based on the requirements for a\ncompliance monitoring program under subdivision (j) of this section and must be\nas effective as the program in determining compliance with the ground-water\nprotection standard under subdivision (c) and in determining the success of a\ncorrective action program under paragraph (5) of this subdivision, where\nappropriate. (5)\n\nIn addition to the\nother requirements of this subdivision, the owner or operator must conduct a\ncorrective action program to remove or treat in place any hazardous\nconstituents under subdivision (d) of this section that exceed concentration\nlimits under subdivision (e) of this section in ground water: (i) Between the compliance point under\nsubdivision (f) of this section and the downgradient facility property\nboundary. (ii)\n\nBeyond the facility\nboundary, where necessary to protect human health and the environment, unless\nthe owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner\nthat, despite the owner's or operator's best efforts, the owner or operator was\nunable to obtain the necessary permission to undertake such action. The owner\nor operator is not relieved of responsibility to clean up a release that has\nmigrated beyond the facility boundary where off-site access is denied. On-site\nmeasures to address such releases will be determined on a case-by-case basis. The permit will specify the measures to be taken. (iii)\n\nCorrective action measures under this\nparagraph must be initiated and completed within a reasonable period of time, considering the extent of contamination. (iv)\n\nCorrective action measures under this\nparagraph may be terminated once the concentration of hazardous constituents\nunder subdivision (d) of this section is reduced to levels below their\nrespective concentration limits under subdivision (e) of this\nsection. (6)\n\nThe owner\nor operator must continue corrective action measures during the compliance\nperiod to the extent necessary to ensure that the ground-water protection\nstandard is not exceeded. If the owner or operator is conducting corrective\naction at the end of the compliance period, that corrective action must be\ncontinued for as long as necessary to achieve compliance with the ground-water\nprotection standard. The owner or operator may terminate corrective action\nmeasures taken beyond the period equal to the active life of the waste\nmanagement area (including the closure period) if the owner or operator can\ndemonstrate, based on data from the ground-water monitoring program under\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision, that the ground- water protection standard\nof subdivision (c) of this section has not been exceeded for a period of three\nconsecutive years. (7)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must report in writing to the department on the effectiveness of the\ncorrective action program. The owner or operator must submit these reports\nannually unless directed by the department to submit the reports\nsemi-annually. (8)\n\nIf the owner or\noperator determines that the corrective action program no longer satisfies the\nrequirements of this section, the owner or operator must, within 90 days, submit an application for a permit modification to make any appropriate changes\nto the program. (l) Corrective action for solid waste management units. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of a facility which\nhas, had, should have had, or is seeking a permit for the treatment, storage or\ndisposal of hazardous waste must institute corrective action as necessary to\nprotect human health and the environment for all releases of hazardous waste or\nconstituents from any solid waste management unit at the facility, regardless\nof the time the waste was placed in such unit. (2)\n\nCorrective action will be specified in\nthe permit or order in accordance with this subdivision and section\n373-2.19\nof this Subpart. The\npermit or order will contain schedules of compliance for such corrective action\n(where such corrective action cannot be completed prior to issuance of the\npermit or order) and assurances of financial responsibility as defined in\nsection\n373-2.8\nof this Subpart, except\nthat language is added to the financial assurance mechanism to include\ncorrective action; or as specified in the Part 373 permit for completing such\ncorrective action. (3)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must implement corrective actions beyond the facility property\nboundary, where necessary to protect human health and the environment, unless\nthe owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the commissioner\nthat, despite the owner's or operator's best efforts, the owner or operator was\nunable to obtain the necessary permission to undertake such actions. The owner\nor operator is not relieved of responsibility to clean up a release that has\nmigrated beyond the facility boundary where off-site access is denied. On-site\nmeasures to address such releases will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Assurances of financial responsibility for such corrective action must be\nprovided. (4)\n\nThis subdivision does\nnot apply to remediation waste management sites unless they are part of a\nfacility subject to a permit for treating, storing or disposing of hazardous\nwastes that are not remediation wastes.
