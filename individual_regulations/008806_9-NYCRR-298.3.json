  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 298.3 - Inventory control and accounting systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Inventory Control. The Bureau of Federal\n\nProperty Assistance system consists of an on-line computer system to process, track and report on the process of acquiring Federal surplus property and\ndistributing it to New York State donees. The program does not have a warehouse\nbut operates on a direct distribution basis to the donees. (1)\n\nReceipt. All property that is received by\nan approved SF123 is catalogued into an online system. The original government\nacquisition cost value is assigned to all items received. Also, the system\nidentifies all passenger vehicles, any single item having an acquisition cost\nof $5,000 or more, and items subject to special restrictions such as special\ndemilitarized items and items for cannibalization. (2)\n\nDistribution. Distribution of property is\nmade only to recognized authorized donee representatives whose signatures are\non file with the SASP. All items issued are listed on a pickup notice (CS403)\nbearing the terms and conditions of donation and are receipted for by the\nauthorized representative of the donee. All items distributed are identified by\na respective SF123 identification and item number. These records establish a\nchain of custody and distribution trail from receipt to final disposition of\nthat said item and facilitates internal control. (3)\n\nReport. At the end of every quarter a\nreport is submitted to GSA (3040 Report) showing total acquisition cost of\nitems received for the period and the total items distributed within that time\nperiod and to what type of organization. The system keeps track of when the\ndonee receives the item and if special \"terms and conditions\" or compliance\nwindows apply to that item. (b) Accounting System. (1)\n\nThe fiscal accounting of the SASP is\nperformed in conjunction with the Office of Financial Administration of the\n\nState Office of General Services, in accordance with the New York State\n\nEducation Law and associated rules and regulations. (2)\n\nThe property accounting and inventory\nsystem employed by the SASP provides and maintains all the records and accounts\nrequired for a full accounting of all property requested, received, issued and\ndisposed of, income, expenses and monthly financial status including: (i) Register of property applied for and\nreceived. (ii)\n\nAll distribution\ndocuments. (iii)\n\nMonthly invoice\nstatements. (iv)\n\nAccounts\nreceivable reports. (v) Monthly\nregister and report of distribution. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
