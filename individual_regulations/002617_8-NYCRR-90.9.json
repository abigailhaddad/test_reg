(a) Definitions. As used in this section and in Education Law, section\n273(1)(f)(5): (1)\n\nChartered and registered\nlibrary means public, free association and Indian libraries, as defined in\nsection\n253\nof the\n\nEducation Law, which are chartered by the Regents or incorporated under a\ngeneral or special act of the Legislature, registered by the department in\naccordance with the provisions of section\n254\nof the\n\nEducation Law and sections\n90.1, 90.2 and\n90.8\nof this Part, and members of\npublic library systems. Library also means each public or free association\nlibrary serving a city with a population of 100,000 or more which merged with\nthe public library system on or before January 1, 1976. Libraries serving\ncities with populations over one million are not chartered and registered\nlibraries within the meaning of this section. (2)\n\nLibrary system means an approved public\nlibrary system as defined in section\n272\n(1)\nof the Education Law, and does not\ninclude library systems serving cities with populations over one\nmillion. (3)\n\nChartered service area\nmeans the geographic area served by a library as stated on charter documents\napproved by the Board of Regents and on file at the department. For the\npurposes of this section, the phrase \"and environs\" or its equivalent as\ncontained in any charter document will not be recognized by the commissioner as\na valid part of a library's chartered service area. For the purpose of this\nsection, areas served by the library under contract will not be recognized by\nthe commissioner as a valid part of a library's chartered service\narea. (4)\n\nThe population of the\nchartered service area shall be deemed to be that shown by the latest Federal\ncensus for the political subdivisions in the chartered service area. Such\npopulation shall be certified in the same manner as provided by section\n54\nof the\n\nState Finance Law except that such population shall include the reservation and\nschool Indian population and inmates of State institutions under the direction, supervision or control of the Department of Correctional Services, the Office\nof Mental Health, the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental\n\nDisabilities, the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services, and the\n\nDepartment of Social Services. In the event that any political subdivisions lie\nwithin larger political subdivisions in a chartered service area, only the\npopulation of the larger subdivision shall be used for the purpose of computing\n\nState aid. (b) Criteria\nfor eligibility. To be approved for local library services aid, a library\nshall: (1)\nbe chartered by the Regents or\nincorporated under a general or special act of the Legislature; (2)\nbe registered by the department in\naccordance with the provisions of section\n254\nof the\n\nEducation Law and sections\n90.1, 90.2 and\n90.8\nof this Part; (3)\nbe included in the membership of a public\nlibrary system, as recorded in the system's plan of service which has been\napproved pursuant to section\n272\nof the\n\nEducation Law; and\n(4)\nhave filed\nwith the department an annual report pursuant to sections\n215\nand\n263\nof the\n\nEducation Law by March 1st. Any library whose annual report for the preceding\nfiscal year is not received within 90 days after the end of a calendar year\nshall not participate in any apportionments of local library services aid for\nthe ensuing State fiscal year unless such neglect is duly excused by the\ncommissioner. (c) Determination of payment amounts. The determination of the payment amount for a\nlibrary for local library services aid is based on the provisions of section\n273\n(1)(f)(5)\nof the Education Law and the\nprovisions of this section. A library will be approved for payment of local\nlibrary services aid based on the population of its chartered service area as\non file at the department. (1)\n\nChanges in\nchartered service area. A library may request a change in chartered service\narea through a formal petition to the Board of Regents for an amendment to its\ncharter, or, in the event the library was created by special act of the\n\nLegislature and has not been chartered by the Regents or admitted to the\n\nUniversity of the State of New York, through an amendment to the special act. (i) A library will be approved for a payment\nof local library services aid based on the population of an amended chartered\nservice area in the calendar year following the year in which the charter\namendment was approved by the Regents. (ii)\n\nNo change in chartered service area will\nbe approved by the Board of Regents if the proposed chartered service area\ncontains partly or wholly within its boundaries the chartered service areas of\none or more other libraries. (2)\n\nPopulation of chartered service area. A\nlibrary will be approved for a payment of local library services aid based on\nthe population of chartered service area as defined in this section. In the\nevent that the chartered service area is not coterminous with a political\nsubdivision, the population of which is shown in the latest Federal census, such population shall be determined for the purpose of computation of State aid\npursuant to section\n273\n(1)(f)(5)\nof the Education Law by at least\none of the following means: (i) applying to\nthe population of such political subdivision the ratio which exists between the\nassessed valuation of the portion of such political subdivision included within\nthe chartered service area and the total assessed valuation of such political\nsubdivision; (ii)\nusing a\npopulation figure for the chartered service area as cited in a published source\nacceptable to the commissioner; (iii)\nusing a population figure for the\nchartered service area as attested to in writing by a Federal, State, regional, or local government official acceptable to the commissioner; (iv)\nin a case where there is no other\nreliable source for a population figure, using a population figure for the\nchartered service area as agreed to by the commissioner, the library board and\nthe director of the public library system. (d) Disbursement procedures. (1)\n\nPublic library systems shall submit an\napplication for local library services aid for their members on a form\nprescribed by the commissioner. The local library services aid payment to a\npublic library system will be disbursed when the annual reports of all its\nmember libraries have been received and approved by the commissioner. (2)\n\nThe commissioner will not make direct\npayments to any individual library. (e) Waivers. In any year in which the\ncommissioner has apportioned a reduction adjustment, any public or association\nlibrary may apply for a waiver in whole or in part of the standards of service\nset forth in section\n90.2\nof this Part. The application\nfor such waiver shall be submitted for such public or association library by\nthe public library system of which such library is a member. Such application\nshall be an addendum to the application prescribed in subdivision (d) of this\nsection. Such a waiver shall be granted by the department for the period of one\nyear provided that a public or association library demonstrates that standards\nof service, in part or in whole, cannot be met because local funding has been\nreduced or is insufficient or because of circumstances beyond such library's\ncontrol, such as a natural disaster. No waiver granted pursuant to this\nsubdivision shall be deemed to relieve a public or association library of any\nobligation imposed by any other provision of Federal or State law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
