Electrical\nand mechanical parts and design principles of the electronic associated\nhardware shall not subject a player to any physical hazards. (b) Environmental effects on system integrity\nstandard. A licensed independent testing laboratory shall perform certain tests\nto determine whether or not outside influences affect game fairness to the\nplayer or create cheating opportunities. An online system shall be able to\nwithstand the following tests, resuming game play without operator\nintervention: (1)\n\nElectromagnetic\ninterference. Systems shall not create electronic noise that affects the\nintegrity or fairness of the neighboring associated equipment. (2)\n\nElectrostatic interference. Protection\nagainst static discharges requires that the system's hardware be grounded in\nsuch a way that static discharge energy shall not damage or inhibit the normal\noperation of the electronics or other components within the system. A system\nmay exhibit temporary disruption when subjected to a significant electrostatic\ndischarge greater than human-body discharge, but such system shall exhibit a\ncapacity to recover and complete any interrupted function without loss or\ncorruption of any control or data information associated with such system. Such\ntests shall be conducted with a severity level of up to 27 kilovolts air\ndischarge. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5317.39\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 16, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 46, eff. 11/16/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
