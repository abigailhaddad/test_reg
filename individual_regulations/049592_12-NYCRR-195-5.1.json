  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 195-5.1 - Deductions for overpayments\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection 193, subdivision 1(c), of the New York State\n\nLabor Law permits an employer to make deductions from an employee's wages for\n\"an overpayment of wages where such overpayment is due to a mathematical or\nother clerical error by the employer.\" Such deductions are only permitted as\nfollows: (a) Timing and duration. The\nemployer may only recover such overpayments as were made in the eight weeks\nprior to the issuance of the notice described in subdivision (e) of this\nsection. The employer may make deductions to recover overpayments for a period\nof six years from the original overpayment. (b) Frequency. The employer shall recover\noverpayments by wage deduction no more frequently than once per wage payment, provided that such deduction complies with this Part. (c) Method of recovery. Overpayments may be\nrecovered through wage deduction or by separate transaction, as long as the\nprocedures of subdivisions (a) and (d) through (i) of this section are\nfollowed. For purposes of this section, payments referenced as wage deductions\nshall include separate transactions. (d) Limitations on the periodic amount of\nrecovery. An employer may recover overpayments by deducting the amount of the\noverpayment from the employee's wages if the deduction complies with any final\ndetermination made in accordance with the procedures required pursuant to\nsubdivision (g) of this section, and as follows: (1)\n\nIn such cases where the entire\noverpayment is less than or equal to the net wages earned after other\npermissible deductions in the next wage payment, the employer may recover the\nentire amount of such overpayment in that next wage payment. (2)\n\nWhere the recovery of an overpayment\nexceeds the net wages after other permissible deductions in the immediately\nsubsequent wage payment, the recovery may not exceed 12.5 percent of the gross\nwages earned in that wage payment nor shall such deduction reduce the effective\nhourly wage below the statutory State minimum hourly wage. (e) Notice of intent. The employer shall\nprovide the employee with notice of the intent to commence the deductions to\nrecover the overpayment. In such cases where the entire amount of the\noverpayment may be reclaimed in the next wage payment pursuant to paragraph\n(d)(1) of this section, notice shall be given at least three days prior to the\ndeduction. In all other cases, notice shall be given at least three weeks\nbefore the deductions may commence. Such notice shall contain the amount\noverpaid in total and per pay period, the total amount to be deducted and the\ndate each deduction shall occur followed by the amount of each deduction. The\nnotice shall also provide notice to the employee that he or she may contest the\noverpayment, provide the date by which the employee shall contest, and include\nthe procedure by which the employee may contest the overpayment and/or terms of\nrecovery, or provide a reference to where such procedure can be\nlocated. (f) Procedure. The\nemployer shall implement a procedure by which the employee may dispute the\noverpayment and terms of recovery, and/or seek a delay in the recovery of such\noverpayment. Dispute resolution provisions in collective bargaining agreements\nexisting at the time of issuance of these regulations which provide at least as\nmuch protection to the employee shall be deemed to be in compliance with this\nsection. Dispute resolution provisions in collective bargaining agreements\nexecuted after the issuance of these regulations which provide at least as much\nprotection to the employee and which specifically reference this section shall\nalso be deemed to be in compliance with this section. (1)\n\nThe employee may only respond within one\nweek from the date of the receipt of the notice of intent to recover\noverpayments that is prepared in accordance with subdivision (e) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nThe employer shall\nreply to the employee's response within one week of receipt of the employee's\nresponse. Such reply shall address the issues raised by the employee in his or\nher response, and contain a clear statement indicating the employer's position\nwith regard to the overpayment, including whether the employer agrees with the\nemployee's position(s) regarding the overpayment or disagrees with the\nemployee's position(s) and provide a reason why the employer agrees or\ndisagrees. (3)\n\nThe employer shall\ngive the employee written notice of the opportunity to meet with the employer\nwithin one week of receiving the employer's reply to discuss any disagreements\nthat remain regarding the deductions. (4)\n\nThe employer shall provide the employee\nwith written notice of the employer's final determination regarding the\ndeductions within one week of this meeting. In making a final determination\nregarding the existence of an overpayment, the employer shall consider the\nagreed upon wage rate paid to the employee and whether the alleged overpayment\nappeared to the employee to be a new agreed upon rate of pay. When making a\nfinal determination regarding the amount of the deduction to be made per pay\nperiod and the date such deduction(s) shall commence, the employer shall\nconsider the issues raised in the employee's request regarding the amount of\neach deduction. (g) Should employees avail themselves of the procedure set forth in subdivision (f)\nof this section, the employer may not commence taking the deduction until at\nleast three weeks after issuing the final determination. Where the entire\noverpayment may be reclaimed in the next wage payment after the overpayment, the employee shall provide their response to the employer within the two days\nof receipt of the notice set forth in subdivision (e) of this section to\npostpone the deduction while the procedure set for in subdivision (f) of this\nsection is followed. The employer is required to repay the employee for any\ndeduction found to be improper no later than the time period provided for\npayment of wages earned on the day of that determination, and is permitted to\nmake the repayment immediately. (h) The failure of an employer to afford this process to the employee will create\nthe presumption that the contested deduction was impermissible. (i) Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as abridging the rights of the employer or employee to seek redress\nin any other forum, including with the Department of Labor. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
