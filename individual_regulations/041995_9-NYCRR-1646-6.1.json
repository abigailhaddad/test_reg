  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-6.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) While the rents\nas fixed by a local agency for the project proper should result in no profit\nfrom operation, there may accrue a net deficit or income during the early\nstages of operation when interest, taxes, etc., are being charged to account\n1420. The early stages of operation of the project proper have been designated\nas the initial operating period, defined in paragraph 102 [FN*] as meaning \"the\nperiod beginning with the first day of the month in which income is first\nderived from rentals from the project proper and ending with the date of\nsubstantial completion\". The initial operating period therefore falls within\nthe development period and it is provided that the net operating deficit of the\nproject proper, if any, incurred during this period shall be considered a\ndevelopment cost and charged to account 1470.3, Net Deficit or (Income), and\nthat, if there should be net income during the period, it will be credited to\naccount 1470.3 and serve to reduce development cost. (b) Procedures applicable to the initial\noperating period have been described in other parts of this Subchapter, particularly in Part 1641, Account Classification, and in Part 1642, Basic\n\nInstructions. The purpose of the following sections is to supplement these\nprocedures and assemble them for ready reference. (c) Generally speaking, it will be necessary, during the initial operating period, to distinguish between expenditures which\nare properly chargeable to initial operating period expense and payable out of\nthe administration fund, as hereinafter described, and other expenditures, such\nas for direct costs (1410 group), carrying charges, and tenant selection costs\n(account 1470.1), which, to the extent set forth in the respective account\ndefinitions, do not constitute expenses of the initial operating period and are\npayable out of the development fund directly. [FN*] Paragraph 102 repealed by resolution filed\n\nOctober 5, 1962. See section\n1600.2, Definitions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1646-6.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
