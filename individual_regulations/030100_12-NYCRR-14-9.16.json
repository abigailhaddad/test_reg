  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.16 - Water gage glasses\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each boiler, except forced-flow steam generators with no fixed steam and\nwaterline, and high-temperature water boilers of the forced circulation type\nthat have no steam and waterline, shall have at least one water gage glass. Boilers operated at pressures over 400 psi shall be provided with two water\ngage glasses which may be connected to a single water column or connected\ndirectly to the drum. Two independent remote level indicators may be provided\ninstead of one of the two required gage glasses for boiler drum water level\nindication in the case of power boilers with all drum safety valves set at or\nabove 900 psi. When both remote level indicators are in reliable operation, the\nremaining gage glass may be shut off, but shall be maintained in serviceable\ncondition. When the direct reading of gage glass water level is not readily\nvisible to the operator in his working area, two dependable indirect\nindications shall be provided, either by transmission of the gage glass image\nor by remote level indicators. (b) The lowest visible part of the water gage glass shall be at least two inches\nabove the lowest permissible water level, at which level there will be no\ndanger of overheating any part of the boiler when in operation at that level. When remote level indication is provided for the operator in lieu of the gage\nglass, the same minimum level reference shall be clearly marked. (c) Connections from the boiler to the remote\nlevel indicator shall be at least 3/4 inch pipe size to and including the\nisolation valve and from there to the remote level indicator at least 1/2 inch\noutside diameter tubing. These connections shall be completely independent of\nother connections for any function other than water level indication. For\npressures of 400 psi or over, lower connections to drums shall be provided with\nshields, sleeves, or other suitable means to reduce temperature differentials\nin the shells or heads. (d) Forced-flow steam generators with no fixed steam and waterline and the\nhigh-temperature water boiler of the forced circulation type require no water\ngage glass or gage cocks. (e) Boilers of the horizontal firetube type shall be so set that when the water is\nat the lowest reading in the water gage glass there shall be at least three\ninches of water over the highest point of the tubes, flues, or crown\nsheets. (f) The bottom mounting for\nwater glass and for water column, if used, must extend not less than 11/2 inch\ninside the boiler and beyond any obstacle immediately above it, and the passage\ntherein must be straight and horizontal. (g) Tubular water glasses must be equipped\nwith a protecting shield. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.16\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
