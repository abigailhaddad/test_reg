  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 34.5 - Exceptions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe exceptions to the requirements imposed under section\n34.3\nof this Part are as\nfollows: (a) For any deposited item\ndrawn in an amount of more than $5,000, the availability of funds shall be\ndetermined according to the depositary bank's policy or, if the customer elects\nto have the item so cleared on a collection basis (i.e., noncash item basis). Where more than one item, each drawn in an amount no greater than $5,000, totalling an amount in excess of $5,000, is deposited in one business day, the\navailability of funds for the item or items that bring the amount deposited to\nan amount in excess of $5,000, shall be determined according to the depositary\nbank's policy or, if the customer elects to have the item(s) so cleared, on a\ncollection basis (i.e., noncash item basis). (b) With respect to items deposited by a new\ncustomer at a depositary bank, the availability of funds for any item deposited\nwithin 30 calendar days of the opening of an account by such customer shall be\nsubject to the depositary bank's policy. (c) If any account or combination of accounts\nof a customer has been overdrawn on three separate and distinct occasions\nwithin a six-month period all accounts of that customer will be subject to the\ndepositary bank's policy regarding the availability of funds, for a period of\nsix months commencing with the last return for insufficient funds. This\nexception does not include accounts with overdraft privileges established\npursuant to contractual agreement unless the customer's credit line has been\nexceeded. (d) In an instance where\nthe depositary bank in good faith doubts the collectibility of funds for an\nitem (e.g., suspicion of bankruptcy of the drawer of a check, suspicion of\nfraud), the depositary bank may make funds available for such item on a\ncollection basis, or according to the depositary bank's policy. The customer of\nthe account must be notified by the depositary bank of this action as soon as\npossible. (e) The availability of\nfunds shall be governed by the depositary bank's policy in the case of any\nitems drawn on an office, including an office of the depositary bank, located\noutside any of the United States and the District of Columbia. (f) Nothing contained in this Part shall\nprohibit a depositary bank and a retail customer from agreeing in writing to a\ngreater period of time than that prescribed by this Part for making funds\navailable for withdrawal because of special circumstances, provided that such\nagreement is not contained in a preprinted form and is not a usual, regular\nbusiness practice of the depositary bank. (g) Delay by a depositary bank beyond time\nlimits prescribed or permitted by this Part is excused if caused by\ninterruption of communication facilities, suspension of payments by another\nbank, war, emergency conditions or other circumstances beyond the control of\nthe depositary bank provided it exercises such diligence as the circumstances\nrequire.
