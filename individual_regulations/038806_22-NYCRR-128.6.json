  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 128.6 - Summoning of trial jurors and grand jurors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Trial jurors and grand jurors shall\nbe selected for summoning at random from prospective jurors previously\nqualified for service. In the alternative, the Chief Administrator of the\n\nCourts may direct that in any county trial jurors and grand jurors be selected\nfor summoning at random from the juror source lists and that their\nqualifications for service be determined during the summoning process in\naccordance with the procedures set forth in section\n128.5\nof this Part. (b) The commissioner of jurors\nshall determine the number of jurors to be selected for summoning and shall\nsummon such jurors, unless such number otherwise is specified by the Chief\n\nAdministrator of the Courts. At any time during a term of court in a county, the court may direct an additional specified number of jurors to be drawn, set\nthe time of the drawing, and require the commissioner to summon the additional\njurors, giving such notice as the court shall direct. The drawing shall be\nconducted in the same manner as a regular drawing. (c) Whenever practicable, the\nsummons shall be served by first class mail at least 14 days before the day the\njuror is required to appear, unless a shorter period is necessary to satisfy\ncourt requirements for sufficient jurors. The commissioner of jurors shall\nmaintain for one year a record of the date and reason when the mailing of the\nsummons occurred less than 14 days before the return date of the summons. If\nservice by first class mail cannot be made or is impracticable, the summons may\nbe served personally upon the juror by personal delivery to the juror, or to a\nperson of suitable age and discretion at the juror's residence or place of\nbusiness. (d) Jurors\nwho appear for the sole purpose of requesting an excuse, deferment or\npostponement from jury service shall not be entitled to any per diem fee or\nmileage allowance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\n§\n128.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
