  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 371.3 - Determination of initial eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn general, the scope of the social investigation shall\nconform to the policies set forth in sections 351.1 through\n351.4, 351.20 through\n351.24, 354.1, 354.2 and\n354.4\nof this Title, but these\nprocesses shall be modified to the extent indicated by the nature of\ninstitutional care and the needs of persons requiring such care. (a) Appropriate form of care. (1)\n\nPrimary emphasis shall be placed upon the\nform of care which will best meet the needs of the individual concerned. This\nshall include consideration of his previous living arrangements; his current\nphysical and mental condition; his ability to live outside the protected\nenvironment of an institutional setting; the availability and suitability of\ncare in a private home for the aged or a private home for adults for which an\napplicant may be eligible because of membership in a fraternal organization or\nother association or in a government home or institution for which an applicant\nmay be eligible because of veteran status; his personal wishes and those of his\nfamily. (2)\n\nResidents of public\nhomes, which are supported by county and State funds, are ineligible for\nsupplemental security income payments. (3)\n\nResidents of public homes who have\nmedical problems should be considered for possible placement in skilled nursing\nor intermediate care facilities. (b) Financial need. (1)\nA person for whom care in his own home is\nnot appropriate shall be eligible as public charge for public home care when\nhis own resources and available support from relatives are insufficient to\nprovide appropriate care elsewhere. (2)\n\nWhen care in a public home is determined\nto be the most suitable form of care, the application shall be accepted. Any\navailable income shall be applied as a refund against current operation and\nmaintenance costs of the institution. (3)\n\nResources shall be explored and utilized\nand recoveries reported in accordance with department regulations. An agency\nmay modify these policies when: (i) the\nindividual may reasonably be presumed to require only short-term care (not in\nexcess of 90 days) and the established local policy provides for modification\nof liquidation, adjustment and/or assignment requirements in such\ncases; (ii)\nthe individual has a\ndependent spouse who is aged or has short life expectancy and with whom he has\nlived prior to his admission; in such cases, a $250 burial reserve may be\npermitted for the spouse, in addition to a reserve for the applicant\nhimself.
