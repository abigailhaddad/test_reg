Tit. 20 § 159.2 - Form of report of change in Federal taxable income, items of tax preference, total taxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution, income tax withholding, disallowance of refund claim or credit for employment related expenses\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 659\n(a) General\n\nThe report referred to in section\n159.1\nof this Part must be made on the prescribed form with respect to a change or\ncorrection in Federal taxable income, Federal items of tax preference, total\ntaxable amount or ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution, the\n\nFederal credit for employment-related expenses and the disallowance in whole or\nin part of a claim for credit or refund of Federal income tax. A change or\ncorrection in the amount an employer is required to deduct and withhold from\nwages for Federal income tax withholding purposes should be reported by\nsubmitting to the Tax Commission a detailed explanation of the final Federal\ndetermination or renegotiation agreement together with a statement showing the\ninclusive dates of the period involved, the amount of new York State personal\nincome tax which should have been withheld and reported. The employer may\nsubmit either an amended form IT-2101 (PNS) or a copy of the final Federal\ndetermination or renegotiation agreement in lieu of submitting a detailed\nexplanation of the final Federal determination or renegotiation agreement. Any\n\nNew York State personal income tax which an employer is required to deduct and\nwithhold as a result of a Federal change or correction should accompany the\nreport required by section\n159.1\nof this Part. The prescribed form used to report the Federal change or\ncorrection must be accompanied by a copy of the final Federal determination or\nrenegotiation agreement as well as any of the pertinent data in all cases in\nwhich a New York State income tax refund, based on such final determination or\na renegotiation, is claimed. Where additional New York State income tax is due, the taxpayer may, in lieu of a copy of the final determination or renegotiation\nagreement, give full details of the changes on such prescribed form. The\nprescribed form used to report the Federal change or correction, together with\nany supplemental forms (where applicable) must be accompanied by full payment\nof any additional New York State income tax shown to be due thereon and must be\nforwarded separately from, and not as part of, any other report or New York\n\nState income tax return. The report must be made regardless of whether the\ntaxpayer believes any modification of such taxpayer's New York State income tax\nliability is required. However, a nonresident taxpayer must make such report, and must file such amended New York State income tax return with the Tax\n\nCommission as required by section\n159.3\nof this Part, only if the Federal change, results of renegotiation or amended\n\nFederal income tax return relates to an increase or decrease in such\nnonresident taxpayer's New York State income tax liability. (b) Husband and wife\nA husband and wife who file a joint Federal income tax\nreturn but file separate New York State personal income tax returns on one form\nmust file separate forms to report Federal adjustments affecting their separate\n\nNew York State personal income tax returns. Each report must show the changes\nmade on the Federal income tax return attributable to the reporting spouse. These separate reports must be filed together. If the Federal changes are\nattributable solely to one spouse, that spouse must file the prescribed form\nused to report the Federal changes. However, such form must include the name\nand social security number of the other spouse and contain a statement that the\n\nFederal changes do not affect the separate New York State personal income tax\nreturn of the other spouse. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n159.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
