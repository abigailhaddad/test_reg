  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 145-1.10 - Regents physician shortage scholarships\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Number. Thirty such awards shall be made\nannually. (b) Eligibility. (1)\nA candidate shall be eligible to compete\nfor such a scholarship if the candidate will begin or continue approved\nprofessional study of medicine or osteopathy during the college year\nimmediately following the college year in which the competition is\nheld. (2)\n\nCandidates will be placed\nwithin the appropriate priority group set forth in paragraph (a) of subdivision\n4 of section\n605\nof the\n\nEducation Law, ranked in accordance with family income. Candidates whose family\nincomes are identical will be ranked by score on an examination acceptable to\nthe commissioner. (c) Areas of shortage of physicians. For the purposes of this program, areas of\nshortage of physicians shall be designated by the Regents, after consultation\nwith the Commissioner of Health, and in accordance with criteria and standards\nestablished by the Regents. (d) Approved practice of medicine. (1)\n\nTo qualify\nfor cancellation of repayment pursuant to the terms of subdivision 4 of section\n605\nof the\n\nEducation Law, the recipient of an award must establish a practice of medicine\nor be employed as a licensed physician to serve an area designated by the\n\nRegents as having a shortage of physicians, and he must provide essentially\nfull-time direct patient care to the residents of such area. The prime\ncriterion which must be fulfilled in order for a physician to qualify for\napproval is that such medical practice or employment must serve to reduce the\nshortage of physicians providing direct patient care in the designated area. If\nagency, institution or government employment, or participation in a group\npractice of medicine, fulfills the foregoing requirements, such activity may be\napproved for the purposes of this program. Except as provided in paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision, the approved practice of medicine may not include service\nas intern or resident in an approved training program. (2)\n\nAward recipients who, on or after January\n1, 1988, commence an approved residency training program in family practice or\nan approved residency or fellowship training program in geriatrics at any\nlocation, or an approved residency training program in general internal\nmedicine, general pediatrics, general obstetrics and gynecology or emergency\nmedicine which is conducted in an area designated by the Regents as a primary\ncare physician shortage area, shall be credited with one month of service\ntoward fulfillment of their service obligation for every two months of service\ncompleted in such an approved residency training program, up to a maximum\ncredit of 18 months of service. (3)\n\nEntrance into an approved practice of medicine must begin not later than one\nyear after the completion of professional training and/or completion of active\nmilitary service, unless the Commissioner of Education shall specify a later\ndate upon a finding that such deferral is consistent with the purposes of the\n\nRegents physician shortage scholarship program. Professional training shall be\nconsidered to be the completion of all internships and residencies normally\nrequired by the recipient's field of specialization. Further, if an area is\ndesignated by the Regents as a shortage area at the time that an award\nrecipient completed his professional training and/or military service, the\npractice of medicine by this recipient in such area shall be considered as\napproved practice for purposes of this program, even if the designation of such\narea should subsequently be changed by the Regents. (e) Revocation of awards. Should an award\nrecipient at any point before completion of the medical degree program cancel\nor withdraw the agreement to practice medicine in an area having a shortage of\nphysicians, or should the award be revoked for other cause, the recipient shall\nnot thereafter be eligible for further awards under the provisions of\nsubdivision 3 or 4 of section\n605\nof the\n\nEducation Law, and if the recipient fails to comply with the requirements\nconcerning approved practice upon completion of h s professional training, the\nfull amount of the awards already received shall be subject to repayment, without regard to other Regents scholarship or tuition assistance program\nawards which the award recipient may otherwise have been entitled to receive\nfor medical study completed before such revocation. However, an award shall not\nbe revoked solely for reason of discontinuing residence in an area of shortage\nof physicians after the effective date of the award. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
