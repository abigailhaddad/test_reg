  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 234.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose\nof this Part, the general definitions of Part 200 of this Title\napply. (b) For the purpose of this\n\nPart, the following definitions also apply: (1)\n\nAlcohol. Ethanol, n-propanol, and\nisopropanol. (2)\n\nAlcohol\nsubstitute. A non-alcohol additive that contains VOC and is used in a fountain\nsolution to reduce the surface tension of water or to prevent piling (ink\nbuild-up). (3)\n\nAs applied. The VOC\nconcentration of ink, coating, or adhesive at the time it is applied to a\nsubstrate; or the alcohol (or alcohol substitute) concentration of a fountain\nsolution at the time it is applied to lithographic press plates. (4)\n\nCapture system. All equipment including, but not limited to, hoods, ducts, fans, booths, ovens, or dryers that contain, collect, and transport an air pollutant to control equipment. (5)\n\nCleaning materials. A liquid solvent or\nsolution used to remove ink and debris from the operating surfaces of the\nprinting press and its parts. For purposes of this rule, cleaning solutions\ninclude, but are not limited to blanket wash, roller wash, metering roller\ncleaner, plate cleaner, impression cylinder washes, rubber rejuvenators, and\nother cleaners used for cleaning a press, press parts, or to remove dried ink\nor coating from areas around the press. (6)\n\nCold-set printing process or non-heatset\nprinting process.A printing process that uses absorption, oxidation, ultraviolet light, electron bean or other non-heat method to cure the printing\nink. (7)\n\nComposite partial vapor\npressure. The sum of the partial pressure of the compounds defined as VOCs. VOC\ncomposite partial vapor pressure is calculated as follows: Image\n\nWhere: Wi =Weight of the \"i\"th VOC compound, in grams\n\nWw =Weight of water, in grams\n\nWc =Weight of exempt compound, in grams\n\nMwi =Molecular weight of the \"i\"th VOC compound, in\ng/g-mole\nMWw =Molecular weight of water, in g/g-mole\nMWc =Molecular weight of exempt compound, in\ng/g-mole\nPPc =VOC composite partial vapor pressure at 20° C (68° F), in mm Hg\n\nVpi =Vapor pressure of the \"i\"th VOC compound at 20° C (68°\nF), in mm Hg\n(8)\n\nControl\nequipment. The equipment used to destroy or remove VOC emissions from graphic\nart printing processes. (9)\n\nDigital\nprinting press. A printing press that transfers electronic files from a\ncomputer to an electronically driven output device that prints the image\ndirectly on a substrate. Also known as direct-to-media printing. (10)\n\nExcluded compound. A compound expressly\nexcluded from the definition of VOC in section\n200.1\nof this Title. (11)\n\nFlexographic printing process. A\nprinting process that raises the image to be applied above the non-image area\nand uses an image carrier made of rubber or other elastomeric\nmaterials. (12)\n\nFountain solution. A solution of water, VOC, gum arabic, and surfactants used for wetting\nlithographic press plates. (13)\n\nGraphic arts. Packaging rotogravure, publication rotogravure, flexographic, offset lithographic, letterpress and screen printing processes. (14)\n\nHeat-set printing process. A printing\nprocess that uses heat to evaporate ink oils from the printing ink. Hot air\ndryers are used to deliver the heat. (15)\n\nLetterpress printing process. A printing\nprocess in which the image is raised relative to the non-image and a paste ink\nis transferred from the image surface directly to the substrate. (16)\n\nMaximum permitted pounds of VOC per\ngallon of ink, coating or adhesive, minus water and excluded compounds, at\napplication. The permissible quantity of VOC per gallon of ink, coating or\nadhesive minus water and excluded compounds; calculated as follows: (VOC)a = (Dc)a ( (Wv)a - (Ww)a - (We)a)/1 - ( (Vw)a +\n(Ve)a)\nwhere: (VOC)a =VOC content of ink, coating or adhesive as\napplied, expressed as a mass of VOC, in pounds, per volume of coating, in\ngallons, minus water and excluded compounds\n(Dc) a =ink, coating or adhesive density as applied, in\npounds per gallon\n(Wv)a =the weight fraction of total VOC in the ink, coating or adhesive as applied\n(Ww)a =the weight fraction of water in the ink, coating or\nadhesive as applied\n(Vw)a =the volume fraction of water in the ink, coating or\nadhesive as applied\n(We) a =the weight fraction of excluded compounds in the\nink, coating or adhesive as applied\n(Ve) a =the volume fraction of excluded compounds in the\nink, coating or adhesive as applied. (17)\n\nOffset lithographic printing process. A\nplanographic printing process that chemically differentiates the image and\nnon-image areas and uses a lithographic plate to transfer the image to an\nintermediate surface which in turn transfers the image to the\nsubstrate. (18)\n\nOverall removal\nefficiency. The total reduction in VOC emissions considering the efficiency of\nboth the capture system and subsequent destruction or removal of these\nemissions by the control equipment prior to their release into the\natmosphere. (19)\n\nPackaging\nrotogravure printing process. A rotogravure printing process upon substrates\nthat are subsequently formed into wallpaper, packaging products, or labels for\narticles to be sold. (20)\n\nPrinting\npress. The equipment used to apply words, pictures, or designs to either a web, or a sheet. A web is a continuous substrate of paper, plastic, or other\nmaterial that is unwound from a roll, passed through ink or coating applicators\nand any associated drying areas. The press includes all ink and coating\napplicators and drying areas between unwind and rewind of the continuous\nsubstrate. A sheet consists of paper, plastic, or other material that is fed\nthrough the press sequentially and carried through the process on a moving\nbelt. The press includes all ink and coating applicators and drying operations\nfrom the time that the sheet is put on the moving belt until it is taken\noff. (21)\n\nPrinting process. Any of\nthe various ways a printing press is operated. (22)\n\nProof press. A printing press used only\nto check the quality of print color and editorial content. (23)\n\nPublication rotogravure printing\nprocess. A rotogravure printing process used to produce books, magazines, catalogs, brochures, directories, newspaper supplements and similar types of\nprinted material. (24)\n\nRotogravure\nprinting process. An intaglio printing process that transfers the inked image\nfrom minute etched or engraved wells on a plate or cylinder to the substrate\nthat is supported by an impression roller. (25)\n\nScreen printing process. A printing\nprocess that delivers ink through a woven mesh fitted with an ink blocking\nstencil. The stencil and mesh openings determine the form and dimensions of the\nimprint. Screen printing processes where the ink is applied by a hand held\nsqueegee are excluded from this definition. (26)\n\nSerigraph. Fine art created or\nreproduced using a screen printing press. (27)\n\nSolvent. A substance that is liquid at\nstandard conditions and is used to dissolve or dilute another substance; this\nterm includes, but is not limited to, organic materials used as dissolvers, viscosity reducers, degreasing agents, or cleaning agents. An excluded compound\nis not a solvent. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n234.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
