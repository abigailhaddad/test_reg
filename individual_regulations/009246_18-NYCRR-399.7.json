  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 399.7 - Administrative disqualification hearings (acts occurring on or after August 1, 1983)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Administrative disqualification hearings are defined in section\n399.1\n(d) of this\n\nPart, and are separate and distinct from administrative food stamp fraud\nhearings which are defined in section\n399.1\n(b). (b) Such hearings are scheduled by the\ndepartment at the request of the local social services district with the\ndepartment providing at least 30 days advance notice to the individual against\nwhom the hearing is requested. (c) Local social services district responsibilities with respect to the compilation\nand content of the evidentiary packet to accompany the district's hearing\nrequest are set forth in section\n399.3\n(i) of this\n\nPart. (d) Upon receipt of a local\nsocial services district's request for a hearing and accompanying evidentiary\npacket, the department will review the packet to determine if it contains\nsufficient documentary evidence to substantiate that an individual has\ncommitted one or more intentional program violations as defined in section\n399.1\n(c) of this\n\nPart. The department will make a further and concurrent determination as to\nwhether the evidentiary packet satisfies the provisions of section\n399.3\n(i). (e) Should the department's review of the\nevidentiary packet indicate that there is either insufficient documentary\nevidence to establish that an intentional program violation was committed or\nthat the packet does not comply with the provisions of section\n399.3\n(i) of this\n\nPart, the department will return the packet to the local social services\ndistrict as insufficient for scheduling. (f) Following a determination that the\nevidentiary packet is sufficient, the department shall schedule an\nadministrative disqualification hearing in accordance with subdivision (b) of\nthis section. The notice of hearing shall be mailed certified mail, return\nreceipt requested, to the recipient charged and shall contain a warning that a\ndetermination of intentional program violation will result in a 6-month\ndisqualification for the first violation, 12-month disqualification for the\nsecond violation and permanent disqualification for the third violation and a\nstatement of which penalty the local social services district believes is\napplicable to the case scheduled for a hearing as well as the information\ncontained in section\n399.6\n(d)(1)-(13)\nof this Part. (g) The department\nshall mail to the local social services district which requested the hearing\nnotification of the time, date and place of the hearing by regular mail at the\nsame time it mails notice of the hearing to the household member. (h) The department shall base a determination\nof intentional program violation on a showing by the local social services\ndistrict by clear and convincing evidence that the household member committed\nand intended to commit intentional program violation as defined in section\n399.1\n(c) of this\n\nPart. The burden of proof shall be on the local district. (i) If the department issues a decision\nconfirming the local social services district's determination of intentional\nprogram violation, no further administrative appeal exists. The household\nmember is entitled to seek relief in a court having appropriate jurisdiction. The period of disqualification may be subject to stay or other injunctive\nremedy by such a court. (j) If the\ndepartment's decision confirms the local social services district's\ndetermination of intentional program violation, the local social services\ndistrict shall mail to the household member found to have committed an\nintentional program violation, a written notice prescribed by the department\nprior to disqualification which shall conform to the requirements set forth in\nsection\n399.6\n(h) of this\n\nPart. (k) The department shall\nschedule hearings requested under the provisions of section\n399.6\n(h)(5)\nof\nthis Part in the same manner as any other fair hearing. (l) A pending administrative disqualification\nhearing shall not affect the individual or the household's right to be\ncertified and participate in the Food Stamp Program. (m) The local social services district shall\noffset any lost benefits to be restored to the household against the\noutstanding amount of the claim from the time it received the department's\ndecision until the claim is liquidated. The district shall send the household a\nwritten indication of each such offset transaction which shall indicate the\nclaim balance before offset, the amount of lost benefits offset and the\nremaining claim balance. (n) The\ntime and place of the hearing shall be arranged so that the hearing is\naccessible to the household member. If the household member or its\nrepresentative cannot be located or fails to appear at the hearing initiated by\nthe State agency, the hearing shall be conducted without the household member\nbeing present. Even though the household member is not present, the hearing\nofficial is required to carefully consider the evidence and determine if\nintentional program violation was committed based on clear and convincing\nevidence. If the household member is found to have committed an intentional\nprogram violation, but a hearing official later determines that the household\nmember or representative had good cause for not appearing, the previous\ndecision shall no longer remain valid and the State agency shall conduct a new\nhearing. The hearing official who originally rules on the case may conduct the\nnew hearing. The household member has 10 days from the date of the scheduled\nhearing to present reasons indicating a good cause for failure to appear. A\nhearing officer must enter the good cause decision into the record. (o) Conducting the hearing. (1)\n\nThe hearing officer shall advise the\nhousehold member or representative that they may refuse to answer questions\nduring the hearing. (2)\n\nThe burden\nof proof shall be on the local social services district. (3)\n\nAll provisions of the department's\nregulations regarding the conduct of fair hearings in the Food Stamp Program, which are not inconsistent with any of the specific provisions of this section, shall be applicable to these hearings. (p) The administrative disqualification\nhearing decision. The decision after hearing shall be based upon clear and\nconvincing evidence which demonstrates that the household member(s) committed, and intended to commit, one or more intentional program violations. (1)\n\nThe decision of the department shall\nspecify the reasons for the decision, identify the supporting evidence, identify the pertinent Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) regulation, and respond\nto reasoned arguments made by the household member or representative. (2)\n\nThe department shall conduct the hearing, arrive at a decision and forward the decision to the local district for\nimplementing action within 90 days (unless there is a client-requested\nadjournment) of the date of the initial notice from the department that the\nhearing has been scheduled. (q) A decision of intentional program\nviolation made after an administrative disqualification hearing cannot be\nreversed by a subsequent fair hearing decision. There is no right to appeal the\ndecision by a fair hearing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n399.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
