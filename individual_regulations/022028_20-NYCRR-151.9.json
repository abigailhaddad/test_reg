Where a resident or a nonresident individual has a\nshort taxable period due to a change in accounting period (see section 604 of\nthe Tax Law), such individual must file a New York State personal income tax\nreturn for such short taxable period if such individual meets any of the\nfollowing conditions: (1)\nsuch individual is\na resident of New York State and is required to file a Federal income tax\nreturn for such short taxable period; or\n(2)\nsuch individual's New York adjusted gross\nincome for such period, determined under Part 112 of this Title (if such\nindividual is a resident) or under Part 132 of this Title (if such individual\nis a nonresident), exceeds the prorated portion of such individual's New York\npersonal exemptions, i.e., the amount which bears the same ratio to the full\namount of New York personal exemptions as the number of months in the short\nperiod bears to 12 months. However, notwithstanding the provisions of the\npreceding sentence, a New York State nonresident personal income tax return\nmust be filed for such short taxable period where a nonresident individual\nincurs a net operating loss for New York State personal income tax purposes but\ndoes not incur a net operating loss for Federal income tax purposes; or\n(3)\nsuch individual's total New\n\nYork items of tax preference, determined under section\n122.1\n(b) of this Title (if such individual is a resident) or under section\n141.1\n(b) of this Title (if such individual is a nonresident), exceeds the allowable\nspecific deduction determined, respectively, under section\n122.7\n(a) or section\n141.2\n(a) of this Title; or\n(4)\nsuch\nindividual is subject to the separate tax imposed by section 601-D of the Tax\n\nLaw upon the termination during such period of a qualified higher education\nfund; or\n(5)\nsuch individual\nreceived a lump sum distribution during such period, any portion of which is\nsubject to the separate tax imposed by section 601-C of the Tax Law.
