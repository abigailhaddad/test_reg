(1)\n\nTenants intending to vacate\nprior to expiration of lease term should be required to give at least one\nmonth's advance notice of such intent in writing. (2)\n\nLiability for rent under a lease usually\nextends until expiration date of lease or until apartment is relet. (3)\n\nPossession of apartments abandoned by\ntenants may be recovered by the housing company through applicable legal\nproceedings. (b) Cooperatives. The procedure to be employed for termination of a cooperator's\ntenancy is set forth below. (1)\n\nCooperator\noffers, in writing, the stock for sale to the corporation or its designee, pursuant to the provisions of the company bylaws and occupancy\nagreement. (2)\n\nThis offer, which\nshall remain open for 90 days, shall constitute the mutual company becoming an\nagent for the sale of the stock. A nominal fee may be charged by the mutual\ncompany, subject to division approval, for acting in the capacity of the agent\nfor the stockholder. (3)\n\nAcceptance\nof the offer by the mutual company shall be indicated in writing which will\nthen closely inspect the apartment to determine damage beyond normal usage; any\ncosts involved for restoration, or unpaid charges are deducted from the equity\ndue the cooperator. (4)\n\nThe mutual\ncompany shall enter transfer of stock on its books and arrangements shall be\nmade for surrender of apartment. (5)\n\nCooperator thereafter surrenders\npossession of apartment at agreed time. (6)\n\nIf no waiting list exists and if the\nmutual company cannot arrange for stock sale within 90 days, the mutual company\nmust advise the cooperator that the shares may be sold on the open market, to\nany person acceptable to the mutual company, subject to income provisions for\nadmission, and approval of the division. (7)\n\nThe cooperator shall continue to be\nresponsible for all carrying charges and utility charges of said apartment for\n90 days from the date the apartment was surrendered in accordance with this\nsection or until the carrying charges and utility charges are assumed by a new\ncooperator, whichever is earliest. Such charges may be deducted from the sums\npaid by the cooperator for shares in the company. (c) Resale of cooperator's apartment. (1)\n\nAll mutual companies are required to\npermit a retiring cooperator to sell shares at a price not to exceed the\nconsideration he actually paid for such shares plus, where not already included\nin the consideration so paid by the retiring cooperator: (i) any capital assessments and voluntary\ncapital contributions, as approved by the division, and actually paid by the\nretiring cooperator to the corporation; and\n(ii)\na proportionate share of the actual\naggregate amortization paid on all existing and prior mortgages on the housing\nproject, in the reduction of the total outstanding principal indebtedness on\nthe project, as determined by the board of directors of the\ncorporation. (2)\n\nThe\nresale price shall not involve any funds of the mutual company, which will only\nact as an agent between the seller and the buyer. No payment shall be made to\nthe retiring cooperator until the buyer's payment has been received and\ncollected. Any obligation of the retiring cooperator to the mutual company\nshould be resolved before payment is released. (3)\n\nThe eligible applicants on the waiting\nlist shall be canvassed in accordance with the procedures outlined in Subpart\n1727-1 of this Part or, if such a canvass proves unproductive, the shares may\nbe offered to a purchaser acceptable to the company and the division. (4)\nA mutual company may never pay a retiring\ncooperator an amount in excess of par value for shares it may purchase in its\nown name. (5)\nA mutual company may\nassess a purchasing cooperator a reasonable administrative charge for the\npreparation and processing of purchase documents, to be established by the\nboard of directors of the mutual company, subject to the written approval of\nthe division.
