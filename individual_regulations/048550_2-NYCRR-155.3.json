  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 155.3 - Actuarial cost estimates\n\nState Regulations\n\nPrior to consideration of a resolution authorizing adoption\nof a State-administered defined benefit volunteer firefighter service award\nprogram, or the transfer of a locally-administered defined benefit volunteer\nfirefighter program to State administration, the governing board of a political\nsubdivision shall obtain from the program actuary an estimate of the annual\ncost of the State-administered defined benefit volunteer firefighter service\naward program. In making such estimate, the program actuary shall calculate\neach separate component of the total estimated cost of a proposed\n\nState-administered defined benefit volunteer firefighter service award program. In the case of a transfer of a locally-administered defined benefit volunteer\nfirefighter service award program to State administration, the program actuary\nshall also estimate the additional amount, if any, determined by the\nadministrator to be necessary to fully fund all existing obligations of such\nprogram, up to and including contributions for credit for a year of\nfirefighting service performed during the calendar year immediately preceding\nthe year in which State administration is anticipated to commence and unfunded\nprior service costs. To enable the program actuary to make such estimates, the\nsponsor and each volunteer fire company or volunteer fire department having\nmembers who are potential participants in the State-administered defined\nbenefit volunteer firefighter service award program shall provide to the\nprogram actuary such information as the program actuary may require, and the\nprogram actuary may rely upon such information in making such estimates. The\nprogram actuary shall make such estimates using the actuarial methodology and\nassumptions that would be used to calculate the contributions payable by the\nsponsor pursuant to section\n155.9\nof this Part. Before\nbeginning to make such estimates, the program actuary shall disclose to the\ngoverning board in writing the fee for preparing such estimates. The fee for\npreparing the estimates shall not exceed the amount which the program actuary\nis permitted to charge for such service pursuant to an agreement between the\nprogram actuary and the Comptroller. The cost of such estimates shall be a\ncharge against the sponsor. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n155.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
