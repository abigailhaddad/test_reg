  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2400.2 - Notice of failure to release a lien\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 3032(c) and (d)\n(a) Administrative review may be obtained by\nfiling a notice of failure to release a lien, as prescribed in subdivision (b)\nof this section, after the expiration of the 40-day period described in section\n2400.1\n(a)(1)-(2)\nof this Part. Filing such a notice of failure to release a lien is not a\nprerequisite to bringing a civil action for damages for failure to release a\nlien in the Court of Claims. Nor does filing such a notice extend the statute\nof limitations for bringing a civil action for damages in the Court of Claims. However, the amount of damages awarded in a civil action under section\n3032\nof the Tax Law may be reduced if the\ncourt determines that the plaintiff has not exhausted the available\nadministrative remedies within the department.
