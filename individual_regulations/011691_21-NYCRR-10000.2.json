  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 10000.2 - Procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Invoices. To\ninitiate any payment pursuant to a contract, a contractor shall submit a proper\ninvoice to the authority except where the contract provides that the contractor\nwill be paid at predetermined intervals without having to submit an invoice for\neach scheduled payment. A proper invoice shall contain a written request for\ncontract payment and shall set forth the description, price and quantity of\ngoods or services delivered or rendered in such form and supported by such\nother substantiating documentation as the authority may reasonably require. For\npurposes of these regulations, receipt of an invoice means (1) the date on\nwhich a proper invoice is actually received by the authority, or (2) the date\non which the authority receives the purchased goods, property or services\ncovered by the proper invoice, whichever is later. (b) Schedule of payment. (1)\n\nThe authority shall make payment under a\ncontract within 30 calendar days (excluding legal holidays) after receipt of a\nproper invoice for the amount of the payment then due. Where the contract\nprovides that the contractor will be paid at predetermined intervals without\nhaving to submit an invoice for each scheduled payment, payments shall be made\nby the payment due dates specified in accordance with the contract. (2)\n\nThe authority shall have 15 calendar days\nafter receipt of an invoice to notify the contractor of: (i) defects in the delivered goods or\nservices; (ii)\ndefect in the\ninvoice; or\n(iii)\nsuspected\nimproprieties of any kind. The existence of any defect or impropriety shall prevent the\ncommencement of the 30-day period specified in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, provided that the Authority notifies the contractor of the\nexistence of any such defect or impropriety within 15 calendar days of receipt\nof the invoice. If such notification is not given within 15 days, the number of\ndays allowed for payment once the defect or impropriety is cured will be\nreduced by the number of days between the 15th day and the day notification was\ngiven.
