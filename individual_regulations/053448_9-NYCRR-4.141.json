  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.141 - Executive order no. 141: authorizing the citizen's utility board access to state agency mailings\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the availability of adequate and affordable\nutility service for all residential customers is necessary for the preservation\nof the health and general welfare of the citizens of this State; WHEREAS, it is the policy of this State to foster and\nencourage citizen participation in utility matters and to facilitate effective\nrepresentation and advocacy of the interests of residential utility customers\nin the regulatory process to ensure that public policies affecting the\nprovision, quality and cost of utility service fairly reflect the needs and\nconcerns of those customers; WHEREAS, individual participation by residential utility\ncustomers in the regulatory process is impracticable because of the expertise\nrequired and the disproportionate expense of taking such action; WHEREAS, the Public Service Commission found, in Case\n28655, that the establishment of a Citizens' Utility Board (\"CUB\") would allow\nresidential customers to participate collectively and directly in the\nregulatory process and would further their interests; and\nWHEREAS, the Public Service Commission also found that\nproviding a CUB limited access to mailings directed to residential utility\ncustomers in order to facilitate increased utility consumer representation\nwould be in the public interest; NOW, THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: 1. A single statewide CUB that is certified\nby the Department of Public Service, pursuant to procedures established by the\n\nDepartment of Public Service and consistent with the criteria considered in\n\nCase 28655, as a single statewide entity representing the interests of\nresidential utility customers throughout New York State and open to membership\nby all such customers, shall have access to State agency mailings under the\nconditions contained in this Executive Order. 2. Certification of the CUB with an interim\nboard of directors by the Department of Public Service, with direction as to\nthe replacement of the interim board with a permanent board elected by the\nmembers, shall comply with the certification requirement. 3. For any mailing by a State agency of the\nsame or a substantially similar type of document to more than 50,000 people in\none year, the State agency shall, upon request by the statewide CUB, include\nenclosures prepared and provided by the CUB under the following conditions: The CUB must provide the appropriate agency or agencies\nwith its proposed enclosure at a time reasonably in advance of the\nmailing; The total number of State mailings to which the CUB may\nhave access shall not exceed four in any calendar year, provided that a series\nor group of the same or substantially similar mailings to over 50,000 people\nover the course of a 12-month period shall be considered one mailing for such\npurposes. In addition, the CUB shall not have access to such mailings three\nyears after the election of the first permanent board of directors or other\nequivalent entity, unless the Department of Public Service determines that\nadditional access is necessary; Enclosures proposed by the CUB shall be limited to\nproviding the following information: the purpose, history, nature, activities and achievements\nof the CUB; that membership in the CUB is open to residential utility\ncustomers; that the CUB is not connected to any utility company or\ngovernmental entity; that the CUB is a not-for-profit corporation directed by\nits consumer members; the procedure for contributing to or becoming a member of\nthe CUB; and\nthe yearly membership fee. 4. Upon furnishing a proposed enclosure to a\n\nState agency for mailing, the CUB shall certify that the proposed enclosure: is not false or misleading; and\nis limited to the information permitted in paragraph 3(c)\nof this Executive Order. A State agency may rely on the CUB's certification and is\nnot required to investigate the basis for the certification. However, in the event a State agency requested by the CUB\nto include an enclosure in the agency's mailing reviews the certification and\nthe proposed enclosure and determines that the proposed enclosure does not meet\nrequirements a) and b) of this paragraph, the agency shall return the enclosure\nto the CUB for revision. If the agency and the CUB are unable to agree on a\nrevision, the agency or the CUB may submit the enclosure to the Department of\n\nPublic Service. If the Department determines that the proposed enclosure is\nsuitable for mailing pursuant to requirements a) and b) of this paragraph, the\nagency shall include the enclosure in its mailing. The Department shall make a\ndetermination promptly, but in no event later than 30 days after its receipt of\nthe enclosure. 5. The CUB\nshall reimburse any State agency that mails a CUB enclosure for any reasonable\nincremental costs incurred by the State agency in complying with this Executive\n\nOrder above the agency's normal postage and handling costs, provided that: such State agency shall first furnish the CUB with an\nitemized accounting of such incremental costs; the CUB shall not be required to reimburse such State\nagency for postage costs if the weight of the CUB's enclosure does not increase\nthe cost of the mailing. If the CUB's enclosure increases the cost of the\nmailing, then it will be required to reimburse the State agency for postage\ncosts over and above what the agency's postage costs would have been without\nthe CUB's enclosure. 6. In\norder to facilitate the CUB's access to State mailings without the imposition\nof unnecessary incremental expenses, upon the CUB's request, a State agency\nshall furnish the CUB with an accurate description and/or cost estimate of an\neligible mailing, including the weight and size of the mailing, prior to\nsending the mailing. The description and/or cost estimate must be provided only\nto the extent reasonably practicable in consideration of the time necessary to\nrespond to the CUB's request and the need to proceed with a given\nmailing. 7. The requirement that\n\nState agencies afford the CUB access to mailings does not require any State\nagency to provide the CUB with a listing of the names or addresses of the\nindividuals to whom the mailing is sent nor does it abrogate, modify or in any\nway affect existing confidentiality or privacy protections that apply to\ninformation held by State agencies. 8. For purposes of this order, \"State agency\"\nand \"agency\" means any department, board, bureau, commission, division, office, council, committee, officer, institution or entity of the State, except that\nthe Public Service Commission and the Department of Public Service shall not be\nconsidered State agencies for purposes of this Executive Order.
