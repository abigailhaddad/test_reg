  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 42-2.8 - Anniversary values when insurance benefits are not level between anniversaries\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purposes of section\n4221 (c)(1) (k)(2) and (3)\nof the Insurance Law, the present value of the future guaranteed benefits payable between anniversaries are discounted to the anniversary preceding their payment using an effective rate of interest and assuming a uniform distribution of deaths or a constant force of mortality. The nonforfeiture interest rate and mortality assumptions for discounting are those required to demonstrate compliance with section\n4221 (c)(1)\nof the Insurance Law. (b) Alternatively, at the option of the life insurance company or fraternal benefit society, for the purposes of section\n4221 (c)(1) (k)(2) and (3)\nof the Insurance Law, the present value of the future guaranteed death benefits may be determined by substituting, for the death benefits payable during any year, a time and amount weighted average of the death benefits provided as payable at the end of the year. As an example, for a death benefit of $100,000 on an anniversary that increases after 8 months to $160,000, a death benefit of $120,000 payable at the end of the year may be substituted. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n42-2.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
