  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 201-6.5 - Special provisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'State\nenforceable requirements'. The department shall specifically designate as not\nbeing federally enforceable, any terms and conditions included in the permit\nthat are not required under the act or under any of its applicable\nrequirements. Terms and conditions so designated are not subject to the\nrequirements of section 201- 6.3 of this Subpart. (b) 'Additional permit conditions for\nfacilities subject to the Acid Rain Program of title IV of the act'. (1)\n\nWhere an applicable requirement of the\nact is more stringent than regulations promulgated under title IV of the act, both requirements shall be incorporated into the permit, and shall be\nenforceable by the department and the administrator. (2)\n\nEmissions exceeding any allowances that\nthe facility owner/operator lawfully holds under title IV of the act or the\nregulations promulgated thereunder shall be prohibited by the permit. However, the facility owner or operator is not required to cover its emissions at all\ntimes. Rather, the facility owner or operator need only have sufficient sulfur\ndioxide allowances to cover emissions at the end of the true-up period in each\nyear. (3)\n\nNo permit modification\nshall be required for increases in emissions that are authorized by allowances\nacquired pursuant to title IV, provided that such increases do not require a\npermit modification under any other applicable requirement. (4)\n\nNo limit shall be placed on the number of\nallowances held by the facility. The facility owner or operator may not, however, use allowances as a defense to noncompliance with any other applicable\nrequirement. (5)\n\nAny allowance\nshall be accounted for according to the procedures established in regulations\npromulgated under the acid rain provisions of title IV. (c) 'Emergency defense provision'. Each title\nV facility permit shall contain a condition that requires reporting of\nnoncompliance due to an emergency as described in Section\n201-1.5\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
