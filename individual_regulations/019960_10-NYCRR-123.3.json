(b) [Definitions.]\n(1)\n\nThe term reservoir wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to the reservoir on Marrowback Brook or to any additional reservoir which may be constructed or used for the purpose of this public water supply. (2)\n\nThe term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and include every spring, pond (other than the artificial reservoirs and filter basins), streams, ditch, gutter or other channel of every kind, the waters of which when running whether continuously or occasionally eventually flow or may flow into the public water supply of the village of Livonia. (3)\n\nWherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a reservoir or from a watercourse is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of such reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (c) Privies adjacent to any lake, reservoir or watercourse. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of any reservoir or within 50 feet of any watercourse tributary to this public water supply.

(4)\n\nThe excreta collected in the aforesaid removable receptacles shall be removed and the receptacles thoroughly cleaned and disinfected as often as may be found necessary to maintain the privy in proper sanitary condition and to effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents, while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal, shall be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises and the adjacent premises. (5)\n\nUnless otherwise specially ordered or permitted by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid removable receptacles permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits at a depth of not less than 12 inches below the surface of the ground and in such manner as to effectually prevent them being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at a distance not less than 500 feet from any reservoir or watercourse tributary to this public water supply. (6)\n\nWhenever it shall be found that, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or owing to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local condition, excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacles or from any trench or place of disposal may, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, be washed over the surface or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any reservoir or watercourse tributary to this public water supply, then the said privy or receptacles for excreta or the trench or place of disposal shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health.
