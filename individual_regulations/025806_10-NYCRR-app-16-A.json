COMBINATION RESPIRATORS\nAny combination of air-purifying and atmosphere-supplying respirators\n\nProtection factor for type and mode of operation as listed above\n30 CFR\n11, Sec. 11.63\n(b). FOOTNOTES\n1. For use in the selection of respiratory protective devices to be used only where contaminants have been identified and the concentrations for possible concentrations are known. 2. Only for shaven faces and where nothing interferes with the seal of tightfitting facepieces against the skin (Hoods and suits are excepted). 3. The mode symbols are defined as follows: CF = continuous flow\nD = demand\nNP = negative pressure (i.e. negative phase during inhalation)\nPD = pressure demand (i.e. always positive pressure)\nPP = positive pressure\nRD = demand recirculating (closed circuit)\nRP = positive pressure, recirculating (closed circuit)\n4. a. The protection factor is a measure of the degree of protection afforded by a respirator defined as the ratio of the concentration of airborne radioactive material outside the respiratory protective equipment to that inside the equipment (usually inside the facepiece) under conditions of use. It is applied to the ambient airborne concentration to estimate the concentrations inhaled by the wearer according to the following formula: Concentration inhaled =\nAmbient airborne concentration\n\nProtection Factor\nb. The protection factors apply: (i) Only for trained individuals wearing properly fitted respirators used and maintained under supervision in a well-planned respiratory protective program. (ii) For air-purifying respirators only with high efficiency particulate filters (above 99.97% removal efficiency by thermally generated 0.3 micro meter dioctyl phtalate (DOP) test) are used in atmospheres not deficient in oxygen and not containing radioactive gas or vapor respiratory hazards. (iii) No allowance is to be made for the use of sorbents against radioactive gases or vapors. (iv) For atmosphere supplying respirators only when supplied with adequate respirable or Respirable air shall be provided of the quality and quantity acquired in accordance with NIOSH/MSHA certification (described in 30 CFR Part\n11\n). Oxygen and air shall not be used in the same apparatus. 5. Excluding radioactive contaminants that present an absorption or submersion. For tritium oxide, approximately one half of the intake occurs by absorption through the skin so that an overall protection factor of less than 2 is appropriate when atmosphere-supplying respirators are used to protect against tritium oxide if the protection factor for a device is 5. The effective protection factor for tritium is about 1.4 for devices with protection factors of 10 the effective factor for tritium oxide is about 1.7 and for devices with protection factors of 100 or more the effective factor for tritium oxide is about 1.9. Air purifying respirators are not suitable for protection against tritium oxide. See also footnote i concerning supplied air suits. 6. Canisters and cartridges shall not be used beyond service-life limitations. 7. Under chin type only this type of respirator is not satisfactory for use where it might be possible (e.g. if an accident or an emergency were to occur) for the ambient airborne concentration to reach instantaneous values greater than 10 times the pertinent values in Schedule 1, Column 1 of Appendix 16-A Table 4 of this Part. This type of respirator is not suitable for protection against plutonium or other high-toxicity materials. The mask shall be tested for fit with irritant smoke, prior to use, each time it is donned. 8. a. Equipment shall be operated in a manner that ensures that proper flow rates are maintained. A protection factor of no more than 1000 may be used for test-and-certified supplied air hoods when a minimum air flow of 6 cubic feet per minute is maintained at the calibrated airline pressure gauges or flow measuring devices are used. A protection factor of up to 8000 may be used for tested and certified hoods only when the air flow is maintained at the manufacturer's recommended maximum rate for the equipment, the rate is greater than 6 cubic feet per minute, and calibrated airline pressure gauges or flow measuring devices are used. b. The design of the supplied-air hood or helmet (with a minimum flow of 6 cubic feet per minute of air) may determine the overall efficiency and the protection it provides. For example, some hoods aspirate contaminated air into the breathing zone when the wearer works with hands overhead. This aspiration may be overcome if a short cape-like extension to the hood is worn under a coat or overalls. Other limitations specified by the approval agency shall be considered before using a hood in certain types of atmospheres, such as the design and the permeability to the contaminant under conditions of use (see footnote 9). 9. Appropriate protection factors shall be determined taking into account the design of the suit and its permeability to the contaminant under conditions of use. There shall be a standby rescue person equipped with self-contained breathing apparatus and communications equipment whenever supplied-air suits are used. 10. No approved schedules are currently available for this equipment. Equipment shall be evaluated by testing or on the basis of reliable test information. 11. This type respirator may provide greater protection and may be used as an emergency device in unknown concentrations for protection against inhalation hazards. External radiation hazards and other limitations to permitted exposure such as skin absorption shall be taken into account in these circumstances. 12. Quantitative fit testing shall be performed on each individual and no more than 0.02% leakage is allowed with this type of apparatus. Perceptible outward leakage of gas from this or any positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus is unacceptable because service life will be reduced substantially. Special training in the use of this type of apparatus shall be provided to the wearer. Protection factor for type and mode of operation as listed above. Note 1: Protection factors for respirators approved by the U.S. Bureau of Mines and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, according to applicable approvals for respirators for type and mode of use to protect against airborne radionuclides, may be used to the extent that they do not exceed the protection factors listed in this table. The protection factors listed in this table may not be appropriate to circumstances where chemical or other respiratory hazards exist in addition to radioactive hazards. The selection and use of respirators for such circumstances should take into account applicable approvals of the U.S. Bureau of Mines and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. Note 2: Radioactive contaminants, for which the concentration values in Appendix 16-C, Table 1, Column 3 are based on internal dose due to inhalation, may present external exposure hazards at higher concentrations. Under these circumstances, limitations on occupancy may have to be governed by external dose limits.

amounts, the limit for the combination shall be derived as follows: determine, for each radionuclide in the combination, the ratio between the quantity present in the combination and the limit otherwise established for the specific radionuclide when not in combination. The sum of such ratios for all radionuclides in the combination may not exceed \"1\" - that is, unity. 1\n\nThe quantities listed above were derived by taking 1/10th of the most restrictive ALI listed in Table 1, Columns 1 and 2, of Appendix 16-C, rounding to the nearest factor of 10, and constraining the values listed between 37 BQ and 37 Mbq (0.001 and 1, 000µCI). Values of 3.7 Mbq (100 µCI) have been assigned for radionuclides having a radioactive half-life in excess of E+9 years, except thenium, 37 Mbq (1000 µCI) to take into account their low specific activity. *To convert µto Kbq, multiply the µCI value by 37.
