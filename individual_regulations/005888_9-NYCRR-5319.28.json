  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.28 - Voucher information\n\nState Regulations\nA voucher shall at a minimum contain the following\nprinted information: (a) gaming\nfacility identifier (It is permissible for this information to be contained on\nthe ticket stock itself); (b) machine number (or cashier/change booth location number, if voucher creation\noutside of the gaming device is supported); (c) date and time (24-hour format); (d) numeric dollar amount of the cash and/or\nthe promotional value of the voucher, displayed independently; (e) the cash value of the voucher displayed\nin text; (f) voucher sequence\nnumber, which refers to a sequential number generated by the gaming device and\nincludes the bank and game location; (g) validation number (including a copy of\nthe validation number on the leading edge of the voucher); (h) bar code or any machine readable code\nrepresenting the validation number; (i) type of transaction or other method of\ndifferentiating voucher types, assuming multiple voucher types are available. Additionally, it is strongly recommended that whenever the voucher type is a\nnon-cashable item, including a prize voucher that required attendant\nintervention to print and that contains an offset barcode that cannot be\ninserted into another gaming device to make additional wagers, that the ticket\nexplicitly expresses that it has \"no cash value\"; (j) indication of an expiration period from\ndate of issue, or date and time the voucher will expire (24-hour format). It is\npermissible for this information to be contained on the ticket stock itself\n(e.g., \"Expires in one year\"); and\n(k) if offline voucher issuance is supported, an offline authentication identifier shall, at a minimum, be printed on the\nimmediate next line following the leading edge validation number that in no way\noverwrites, or otherwise compromises, the printing of the validation number on\nthe ticket (not required for vouchers that are non-redeemable at a gaming\nmachine). The offline authentication identifier shall be derived by a hash, or\nother secure encryption method of at least 128 bits, that uniquely will\nidentify the voucher, verify that the voucher was created in the gaming\nfacility where the redemption is occurring and validate the amount of the\nvoucher. When a suitable authentication identifier is not printed on the\nvoucher, a gaming device shall only allow for one additional voucher print out\nafter such gaming device to system communications has been lost.
