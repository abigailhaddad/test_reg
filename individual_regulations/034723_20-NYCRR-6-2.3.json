  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 6-2.3 - Unitary business requirement\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-C)\n(a) General. For purposes of this Subchapter, the term \"unitary business\" shall be construed to the broadest extent permitted\nunder the U.S. Constitution as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, the\ncourts of this state and the New York State Tax Appeals Tribunal. (b) Attributes of a unitary business. (1)\nA unitary business is characterized by a\nflow of value as evidenced by functional integration, centralized management\nand economies of scale. (i) Functional\nintegration is characterized by transfers between, or pooling among, business\nactivities that significantly affect the operation of the business activities. Functional integration includes, but is not limited to, transfers or pooling\nwith respect to the business's products or services, technical information, marketing information, distribution systems, purchasing and intangibles. The\nuse of market-based or arm's length pricing for such transactions does not\nnegate the presence of functional integration. (ii)\n\nCentralized management exists when\ndirectors, officers, and/or other management employees jointly participate in\nthe management decisions that affect the respective business activities and\nthat may also operate to the benefit of the entire economic enterprise. Centralized management may exist even when day-to-day management responsibility\nand accountability have been decentralized, so long as the management has an\noperational role with respect to the business activities, such as participation\nin overall operational strategy for the business. (iii)\n\nEconomies of scale refers to a\nrelationship among and between business activities resulting in a significant\ndecrease in the average per unit cost of operational or administrative\nfunctions due to the increase in operational size. Economies of scale may exist\nfrom the inherent cost savings that arise from the presence of functional\nintegration or centralized management. (2)\n\nFunctional integration, centralized\nmanagement and economies of scale should be analyzed in conjunction with one\nanother for their cumulative effect. The determination of a unitary business\ndepends on all of the facts and circumstances of each case. (c) Presumptions. Without limiting\nthe scope of a unitary business, a unitary business will be presumed in the\nfollowing factual scenarios. The corporation or the commissioner may overcome\nthe presumption that the corporations in question are engaged in a unitary\nbusiness by the presentation of clear and convincing evidence. If the\nactivities of the corporations do not give rise to one of the presumptions set\nforth below, the presence of a unitary business will be determined based on all\nof the facts and circumstances of the case without the application of a\npresumption in favor of or against a finding of a unitary business. (1)\n\nHorizontal integration. Corporations that\nsatisfy the capital stock requirement are presumed to be engaged in a unitary\nbusiness when their primary activities are in the same general line of\nbusiness. (2)\n\nVertical integration. Corporations that satisfy the capital stock requirement are presumed to be\nengaged in a unitary business when the corporations are engaged in different\nsteps in a vertically structured enterprise. (3)\n\nStrong centralized management. Corporations that satisfy the capital stock requirement, and that might\notherwise be considered as engaged in more than one unitary business, are\npresumed to be engaged in one unitary business where there is strong central\nmanagement coupled with the existence of centralized departments or affiliates\nfor such functions as financing, advertising, research and development, or\npurchasing. (4)\n\nNewly-formed\ncorporations. A newly-formed corporation is presumed to be engaged in a unitary\nbusiness with its forming corporation or corporations in the taxable year of\nthe newly-formed corporation that includes the date the corporations satisfy\nthe capital stock requirement and starting from that date. (5)\n\nNewly-acquired corporations. A\nnewly-acquired corporation is presumed to be engaged in a unitary business with\nits acquiring corporation in the first taxable year that the corporations\nsatisfy the capital stock requirement and starting in that year, if the\ncorporations are engaged in a relationship described in paragraph 1, 2 or 3 of\nthis subdivision. (6)\n\nHolding\ncompanies. If a holding company, including a passive holding company, financial\nholding company, or a bank holding company, and one or more operating companies\ntogether satisfy the capital stock requirement, the holding company is presumed\nto be engaged in a unitary business with the operating company or\ncompanies. (d) Examples. The following examples are intended to illustrate the\npresumptions set forth above. For purposes of the illustrations, the\ncorporations referred to in the examples satisfy the capital stock\nrequirement. Example 1: Corporations A and B sell natural and organic\nfoods at their retail stores located throughout the United States. Corporation\nC sells the same types of foods at its retail stores located in Canada. Corporations A, B and C are presumed to be engaged in a unitary\nbusiness. Example 2: Corporation A is engaged in the exploration of\noil. Corporation B extracts the oil found by Corporation A. Corporation C\nprocesses the oil extracted by Corporation B. Corporation D sells the oil\nprocessed by Corporation C. Corporations A, B, C and D are presumed to be\nengaged in a unitary business. Example 3: Corporations A, B and C manufacture and sell\nchildren's apparel to customers located throughout the United States. Corporations D and E operate a chain of restaurants located in New York and\n\nFlorida. Corporation F provides centralized purchasing, advertising and finance\nservices to Corporations A, B, C, D and E. The executive officers of\n\nCorporation F are also actively engaged in the operations of Corporations A, B,C, D and E. Corporations A, B, C, D, E and F are presumed to be engaged in\none unitary business. Example 4: Corporation A contributes all of its\nintellectual property to Corporation B for 100% of Corporation B's capital\nstock. Corporations A and B are presumed to be engaged in a unitary business in\nthe first taxable year in which they satisfy the capital stock\nrequirement. Example 5: Corporation A acquires 51% of the capital\nstock of Corporation B. Corporation B distributes the products manufactured by\n\nCorporation A such that Corporations A and B are part of a vertically\nstructured business apart from satisfying the capital stock requirement. Corporations A and B are presumed to be engaged in a unitary business in the\nfirst taxable year that includes the acquisition. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
