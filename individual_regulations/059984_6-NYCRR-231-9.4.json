  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-9.4 - Setting the initial pal\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe PAL for a facility must be calculated as the sum of\nthe baseline actual emissions of the PAL contaminant for each emission source\nat the facility plus an amount equal to the applicable significant project\nthreshold for the PAL contaminant under Subpart 231-13 of this Part or under\nthe act, whichever is lower. (a) When\nestablishing the PAL for a particular PAL contaminant, only one 24 consecutive\nmonth period may be used to determine the baseline actual emissions for all\nemission sources. However, a different 24 consecutive month period may be used\nfor each different PAL contaminant. (b) Emissions associated with emission\nsources that were permanently shut down after this 24 consecutive month period\nmust be subtracted from the PAL calculation. (c) Emissions from a permitted emission\nsource or an exempt or trivial emission source on which actual construction\nbegan after the 24 consecutive month period, but has not yet commenced\noperation, must be added to the PAL calculation in an amount equal to the\npotential to emit of the emission source. (d) Where the department is aware of any\nfuture applicable requirement(s), prior to issuance of the permit which\nestablishes the PAL, the department will specify a reduced PAL in the permit to\nbecome effective on the future compliance date(s) of the applicable\nrequirement(s). For example, if the facility will be required to reduce\nemissions from industrial boilers in half from baseline emissions of 60 ppm NO\nx\nto a new rule limit of 30 ppm, the permit must contain\na future effective PAL that is equal to the current PAL reduced by half of the\noriginal baseline emissions of such emission source(s). (e) Commencing with the first day of the\nsixth year of the PAL, the PAL shall be reduced as follows: (1)\n\nThe PAL level shall be reduced to 75\npercent of the initial PAL level unless the owner or operator demonstrates that\na lesser level of reduction is justified in accordance with paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision. (2)\n\nThe owner or\noperator may seek an alternative reduced PAL level by demonstrating, at the\ntime of application for the PAL, that application of BACT and/or LAER\n(depending on whether attainment or nonattainment requirements apply) on all\nmajor PAL emission sources at the facility would not result in a 25 percent\nreduction in the initial PAL level, assuming operation of those major PAL\nemission sources at full capacity. In its application for a PAL, the owner or\noperator shall provide, as applicable, a BACT review in accordance with section\n231-8.7\nof this Part and/or a LAER\nanalysis in accordance with section\n231-6.5\nof this Part. Based on the\ninformation provided, the department may, in its sole discretion, authorize a\nreduction in the PAL to a level that would reflect the emissions from the\nfacility if all major PAL emission sources are operated at full capacity after\ncomplying with BACT and/or LAER, as applicable. In making these determinations, emissions from minor PAL emissions sources shall be held constant at the\ninitial baseline levels. In no event shall the reduced PAL level calculated in\nthis paragraph exceed the initial PAL level set in subdivisions (a) through (d)\nof this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n231-9.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
