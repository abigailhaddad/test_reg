(2)\n\nNot\naccepted for assistance. Applications are denied and not accepted for\nassistance when: (i) In the course of the\napplication interview the information given by the applicant establishes, without the need for further investigation, that he is ineligible. (ii)\n\nIneligibility is determined in the\ncourse of or upon completion of the investigation, or if the applicant refuses\nto comply with any requirement essential to the determination of\neligibility. (3)\n\nTerminations without decision. No decision is required when: (i) an application is withdrawn by the\napplicant; or\n(ii)\nthe social\nservices official documents that the applicant has died, cannot be located, or\nhas left the district prior to the completion of the investigation. (b) The decision to\naccept or deny the application must be made within 30 days from the date of\napplication for both family assistance and safety net assistance, except where\nthe applicant requests additional time or where difficulties in verification\nlead to an unusual delay, or for other reasons beyond the social services\nofficial's control. The applicant must be notified in writing of the decision\nin accordance with department regulations. The reason for the delay in deciding\nwhether to accept or deny an application must be recorded in the case record\nand communicated to the applicant.

It shall be the responsibility of the social services\nofficial to fully explore and develop all such resources. (2)\n\nThe amount of the initial grant of\nregularly recurring financial assistance for both family assistance and safety\nnet assistance must be computed starting with the date of establishment of\neligibility or the 30th day after the date of application, whichever is\nearlier.

(4)\n\nWhen eligibility has not been established\nbut immediate need is determined to exist, an emergency or predetermination\ngrant of assistance shall be made in accordance with department\nregulations.
