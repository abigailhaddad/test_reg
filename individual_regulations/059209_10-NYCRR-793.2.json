Tit. 10 § 793.2 - Eligibility, election, admission and discharge\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe governing authority shall ensure that: (a) except as prohibited by article 45 of the\n\nPublic Health Law or any other law or regulation, a patient referred to a\nhospice may be accepted from any source; (b) policies and procedures for admission and\ndischarge are developed and implemented; (c) any individual admitted to hospice is\ncertified as being terminally ill consistent with State and/or Federal\ndefinitions. Written certification of terminal illness is required for each\nelection period defined in paragraph (d)(4) of this section. If the hospice\ncannot obtain the written certification within two calendar days after the\nelection period begins, it must obtain an oral certification within two\ncalendar days and the written certification before it submits a claim for\npayment. (1)\n\nInitial certification of\nterminal illness must be obtained from either the medical director of the\nhospice or the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group provided\nfor in section\n793.4\nof this Part, and also from\nthe individual's attending physician, if the individual has an attending\nphysician. In connection with the initial certification, the medical director\nor physician designee must consider the following: (i) diagnosis of the primary terminal\ncondition, along with any supporting current clinically relevant\ninformation; (ii)\ndiagnoses, if any, along with any supporting current clinically relevant\ninformation; (iii)\ncurrent\nsubjective and objective medical findings; (iv)\ncurrent medication and treatment orders; and\n(v) information about the\nmedical management of any of the patient's conditions unrelated to the terminal\nillness. (2)\n\nSubsequent\ncertifications of terminal illness are obtained from the medical director of\nthe hospice or the physician member of the hospice interdisciplinary group and\nmust be based on the certifying individual's clinical judgment regarding the\nnormal course of the individual's illness. (3)\n\nAll certifications must: (i) specify that the individual's prognosis\nis for a life expectancy consistent with applicable State and Federal statutes\nfor purposes of payment; (ii)\ninclude clinical information and other documentation that support the medical\nprognosis; and\n(iii)\nbe filed in\nthe clinical record. (d) an individual who meets the hospice\neligibility requirements files an election statement with a particular hospice. If the individual is physically or mentally incapacitated, his or her\nrepresentative as provided for in section\n793.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart may file the election statement; (1)\n\nThe\nelection statement shall remain in effect as long as the individual remains in\nthe care of a hospice unless the individual revokes the election in accordance\nwith paragraph (3) of this subdivision or is discharged from the hospice in\naccordance with subdivision (e) of this section. He/she may at any time file an\nelection if again eligible for hospice care. (2)\n\nThe signed election statement must: (i) identify the hospice that will provide\ncare; (ii)\ninclude the individual's\nor representative's acknowledgment that he or she has been given a full\nunderstanding of the palliative rather than curative nature of hospice care; and\n(iii)\ninclude the effective\ndate of the election, which may be the first day of hospice care or a later\ndate, but no earlier than the date of the election statement. (3)\n\nAn individual or\nrepresentative may revoke the election of hospice care at any time by filing a\nsigned and dated revocation statement with the hospice. This statement must\ninclude the effective date for the revocation. (4)\n\nAn individual may elect to receive\nhospice care during one or more of the following election periods, which are\navailable in the order listed and may be selected separately at different\ntimes: (i) an initial 90-day\nperiod; (ii)\na subsequent 90-day\nperiod; (iii)\nan unlimited number\nof subsequent 60-day periods. (e) a patient is discharged only if: (1)\nthe patient moves out of the hospice's\nservice area or transfers to another hospice; (2)\nthe hospice determines that the patient\nno longer meets the eligibility criteria set forth in subdivision (c) of this\nsection; or\n(3)\nthe hospice\ndetermines, under a policy set by the hospice for the purpose of addressing\ndischarge for cause that the patient's (or other persons in the patient's home)\nbehavior is disruptive, abusive, or uncooperative to the extent that delivery\nof care to the patient or the ability of the hospice to operate effectively is\nseriously impaired. (i) The hospice must do\nthe following before it seeks to discharge a patient for cause: (a) advise the patient that a discharge for\ncause is being considered; (b) make\na serious effort to resolve the problem(s) presented by the patient's behavior\nor situation; (c) ascertain that\nthe patient's proposed discharge is not due to the patient's use of necessary\nhospice services; and\n(d) document\nthe problem(s) and efforts made to resolve the problem(s) and enter this\ndocumentation into the clinical record. (ii)\n\nPrior to discharging a patient, a\nwritten discharge order must be obtained from the hospice medical director. If\na patient has an attending physician involved in his or her care, this\nphysician should be consulted before discharge and his or her review and\ndecision included in the discharge note. (iii)\n\nPrior to discharging a patient or\ntransferring the patient from one hospice to another, continuing care and\nservices shall be arranged and a discharge summary completed as specified in\nsection\n794.4\nof this Title.
