The tenant's acceptance of such offer shall be entered on the designated\npart of the prescribed form, and returned to the landlord by certified mail. In\nthe event that such 90-day notice expires after the expiration of the lease, the provisions of subdivision (b) of this section shall govern. (b) (1)\n\nWhere the owner fails to offer a renewal of the lease in accordance with\nsubdivision (a) of this section, the tenant shall have the option of choosing: (i) whether the one-or two-year term of such\nlease whenever it is offered shall commence on the date a renewal lease would\nhave commenced had a timely offer been made; or\n(ii)\non the first rent payment date\ncommencing 90 days after the date that the owner does offer the lease to the\ntenant on the prescribed notice form. The guidelines rate applicable in such\ncases shall be the rate in effect on the first day subsequent to the expiration\nof the last lease or the rate in effect when the lease is renewed; whichever is\nlower. (2)\n\nWhere the\ntenant fails to timely renew an expiring lease or rental agreement offered\npursuant to this section, and remains in occupancy after expiration of the\nlease, such lease or rental agreement may be deemed to be in effect, for the\npurpose of determining the rent in an overcharge proceeding, where such deeming\nwould be appropriate pursuant to Real Property Law section 232-c. In such\nevent, the expiring lease will be deemed to have been renewed upon the same\nterms and conditions at the legal regulated rent, together with any guidelines\nadjustments that would have been applicable had the offer of a renewal lease\nbeen timely accepted. Unless otherwise dictated by Real Property Law section\n232-c, the effective date of the rent adjustment under the deemed renewal lease\nshall commence on the first rent payment date occurring no less than 90 days\nafter such offer is made by the owner.

(d) (1)\n\nUnless otherwise prohibited by occupancy\nrestrictions based upon income limitations pursuant to federal, state or local\nlaw, regulations or other requirements of governmental agencies, if an offer is\nmade to the tenant pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (a) of this\nsection, and such tenant has permanently vacated the housing accommodation, any\nmember of such tenant's family, as defined in section\n2500.2\n(n) of this\n\nTitle, who has resided with the tenant in the housing accommodation as a\nprimary residence for a period of no less than two years, or where such person\nis a \"senior citizen,\" or a \"disabled person\" as defined in paragraph (4) of\nthis subdivision, for a period of no less than one year, immediately prior to\nthe permanent vacating of the housing accommodation by the tenant, or from the\ninception of the tenancy or commencement of the relationship, if for less than\nsuch periods, shall be entitled to be named as a tenant on the renewal lease. A\ntenant shall be considered to have permanently vacated the subject housing\naccommodation when the tenant has permanently ceased residing in the housing\naccommodation. The continued payment of rent by the tenant or the signing of\nrenewal leases shall not preclude a claim by a family member as defined in\nsection\n2500.2\n(n) of this\n\nTitle in seeking tenancy. (2)\n\nThe\nminimum periods of required residency set forth in this subdivision shall not\nbe deemed to be interrupted by any period during which the \"family member\"\ntemporarily relocates because he or she: (i) is engaged in active military duty; (ii)\nis enrolled as a full time\nstudent; (iii)\nis not in residence\nat the housing accommodation pursuant to a court order not involving any term\nor provision of the lease, and not involving any grounds specified in the Real\n\nProperty Actions and Proceedings Law; (iv)\nis engaged in employment requiring\ntemporary relocation from the housing accommodation; (v) is hospitalized for medical treatment; or\n(vi)\nhas such other reasonable\ngrounds that shall be determined by the division upon application by such\nperson.

Failure of the tenant to provide\nsuch information to the owner, regardless of whether the owner requests the\ninformation, shall place upon all such persons not so made known to the owner, who seek to exercise the right to be named as a tenant on a renewal lease as\nprovided for in subdivision (d) of this section, the affirmative obligation to\nestablish such right. (f) For the purpose of determining whether an\nowner may charge the rent increases authorized pursuant to subdivision g of\nsection 6 of the act, every owner who enters into a renewal lease pursuant to\nsubdivision (d) of this section, shall notify the division, in a manner\nprescribed by the division, whether the tenant named on the lease in effect for\nthe housing accommodation at the time such notice is given was so named as the\nresult of the exercise of rights pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section, together with the commencement date of the first renewal lease for the housing\naccommodation on which such tenant was named. Such notice shall create a\nrebuttable presumption that the owner is entitled to collect such\nsum. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
