(6)\n\nBitter. Distasteful, similar to taste of\nquinine. Most frequently found in aged cheese. (7)\n\nFruity. A sweet fruit-like flavor\nresembling apples; generally increasing in intensity as the cheese\nages. (8)\n\nWhey-taint. A slightly\nacid flavor and odor characteristic of fermented whey caused by too slow\nexpulsion of whey from the curd. (9)\n\nOld milk. Lacks freshness. (10)\n\nLipase. A flavor suggestive of rancidity\nor butyric acid, sometimes associated with a bitterness. (11)\n\nSulfide. An objectionable flavor of\nhydrogen sulfide similar to the flavor of water with a high sulfur\ncontent. (12)\n\nForeign. Flavors not\nnormally associated with cheese, such as contaminants.

Somewhat less firm but not to the extent of materially injuring the keeping\nquality of the cheese. (3)\n\nOpen. Mechanical openings that are irregular in shape and are caused by workmanship\nand not gas fermentation. (4)\n\nSweet\nholes. Spherical gas holes, glossy in appearance; usually about the size of BB\nshots; also referred to as shot or Swiss holes. (5)\n\nWeak. Requires little pressure to crush, is soft but is not necessarily sticky like a pasty cheese. (6)\n\nPasty.

Loosely knit\nand tends to fall apart when rubbed between the thumb and fingers. (8)\n\nGassy. Gas holes of various sizes and may\nbe scattered. (9)\n\nPinny. Numerous\nvery small gas holes. (10)\n\nPractically free of gas. Limited gas or sweet holes are acceptable, provided\nthat the body or flavor is commensurate with standards set forth in section\n34.4\n(a)(1) and (2)\nof this Part.

Specks resembling grains of salt scattered throughout the cheese. They\nare generally associated with aged cheese. (e) With respect to finish and appearance: (1)\n\nWax or paraffin that adheres firmly to\nthe surface of the cheese. Thin or thick coating with no indication of\ncracking, breaking or loosening. (2)\n\nRind. Hard coating caused by the\ndesiccation of the surface of the cheese. (3)\n\nFirm sound rind. Possessing a firmness\nand thickness (not easily dented or damaged) consistent with the size of the\ncheese and which is dry, smooth, and closely knit, sufficient to protect the\ninterior quality from external defects; free from checks, cracks, breaks, or\nsoft spots. (4)\n\nBurst or torn\nbandage. A severance of the bandage usually occurring at the side seam or is\notherwise snagged or broken. (5)\n\nWrapper or covering. Transparent or opaque material (plastic film type or foil)\nnext to the surface of the cheese, used as an enclosure or covering of the\ncheese. (6)\n\nAdequately and securely\nenveloped.

(15)\n\nIrregular bandaging. Bandage improperly\nplaced in the hoop resulting in too much bandage on one end and insufficient on\nthe other causing overlapping; wrinkled and loose fitting. (16)\n\nLopsided. One side of the cheese is\nhigher than the other side. (17)\n\nHigh edge. A rim or ridge on the follower side of the cheese, which is raised\nin varying degrees. In extreme cases it may bend over. (18)\n\nDefective coating.

Its texture may or may\nnot be entirely broken down. (3)\n\nCured, sharp, aged or any other equivalent term shall mean moderate to well\ndeveloped degree of flavor and sharpness. Its texture shall be entirely free\nfrom curdiness. (4)\n\nExtra sharp, very sharp, old, tangy or any other equivalent term shall mean well developed\ndegrees of flavor and aroma so that its sharpness is clearly discernible to\ntaste and smell.
