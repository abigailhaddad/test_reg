  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 166-1.1 - Reasonable rate of return\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The reasonable rate of return shall be 18 percent. (b) The department accepts its consultant's methodology, and the resulting reasonable rate of return of 18 percent. The methodology appropriately measures rates of return by line of business in a single state, as the law requires, and, since it is based on an analysis of prior years' results, it is suitable for use in a retrospective review of profitability. (c) See section\n166-2.1\nof this Part for discussion of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n166-1.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
