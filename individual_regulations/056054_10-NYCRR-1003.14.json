  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 1003.14 - Legal Protections; State Action Immunity\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nAn\nACO certified pursuant to this Part shall not be considered to be in violation\nof Article 22 of the General Business Law relating to contracts or agreement in\nrestraint of trade if the ACO's actions qualify for the safety zone, subject to\nthe antitrust analysis set forth in the\n\nStatement of Antitrust\n\nEnforcement Policy Regarding Accountable Care Organizations Participating in\nthe Medicare Shared Savings Program\nissued by the Federal Trade\n\nCommission and U.S. Department of Justice and published in the Federal Register\non October 28, 2011. For ACOs that do not participate in one of the CMS\nAccountable Care Organization shared savings programs, certification under this\n\nPart will be considered equivalent to participation with CMS. (2)\n\nAs part of its application for a\ncertificate of authority under this Part, an ACO may request that the state\nprovide state action immunity from federal and state antitrust laws. An ACO\nrequesting review shall submit, in addition to the application materials\nrequired by this Part, any additional materials or information requested by the\n\nDepartment to make a state action immunity determination. The factors to be\nconsidered in evaluating requests for state action immunity pursuant to this\n\nPart shall include, but shall not be limited to: (i) the potential benefits of the ACO's\ncollaborative activities, including but not limited to the likelihood that one\nor more of the following may result from such activities: (a) Preservation of needed health care\nservices in the relevant primary service area that would be at risk of\nelimination in the absence of the ACO's collaborative activities\n(b) Improvement in the nature or distribution\nof health care services in the primary service area, including expansion of\nneeded health care services or elimination of unnecessary health care\nservices; (c) Enhancement of the\nquality of health care provided by the ACO and its participants; (d) Expansion of access to care by\nmedically-underserved populations; (e) Lower costs and improved efficiency of\ndelivering health care services; including reductions in administrative and\ncapital costs and improvements in the utilization of health care provider\nresources and equipment; or\n(f) Implementation of payment methodologies that control excess utilization and\ncosts, while improving outcomes; (ii)\nthe health care provider landscape of\nthe relevant primary service area, including the availability of suitable and\naccessible health care services and the level of competition in the primary\nservice area, the likelihood that other health care providers will enter or\nexit the primary service area, the health care workforce and the existence of\nunique challenges such as difficulties in recruiting and retaining health care\nprofessionals; (iii)\nthe potential\ndisadvantages of the ACO's collaborative activities; (iv)\nthe availability of arrangements that\nare less restrictive to competition and achieve the same benefits or a more\nfavorable balance of benefits over disadvantages attributable to any reduction\nin competition; (v) other benefits\nor disadvantages identified in the course of review; and\n(vi)\nthe extent to which active supervision\nis likely to mitigate any disadvantages. In determining whether to provide state action immunity, the\n\nDepartment may impose such conditions as necessary to ensure that the\nactivities of the ACO are consistent with the purposes of Article 29-E and/or\nare necessary to ameliorate any potential disadvantages. If the Department determines to provide state action\nimmunity, such determination shall be reflected on the certificate of authority\nor in an amendment thereto. In such case, the State shall provide active state\nsupervision and the ACO shall provide such materials or information as is\nrequested by the Department for such\npurpose. (b) An ACO certified pursuant to this Part\nshall not be considered to be in violation of Article 131-A of the Education\n\nLaw relating to fee splitting in the following circumstances: (1)\n\nWhen as a function or activity of the\nACO, the ACO enters into contracts or arrangements reasonably related to and\nnecessary for operations of the ACO; or\n(2)\n\nThe shared savings are: (i) Distributed to and among individuals or\nentities who were ACO participants during the year in which the shared savings\nwere earned; or\n(ii)\n\nUsed for\nactivities that are reasonably related to the purposes of the\nACO. (c) Health\ncare providers, as defined in Title 2-D of Article 2 of the Public Health Law, who participate in or contract with an ACO certified pursuant to this Part, and\nwho make referrals to other health care providers within the scope of the ACO's\nfunctions, activities and services, shall not be considered to be in violation\nof Title 2-D of Article 2 of the Public Health Law relating to health care\npractitioner referrals. (d) A\nmedical assistance provider, as defined in section\n366-d\nof\nthe Social Services Law, that enters into arrangements with an ACO certified\npursuant to this Part, one or more of its ACO participants, or a combination\nthereof, shall not be in violation of section\n366-d\nof\nthe Social Services Law. (e) In\norder to obtain the protections under subdivisions (b), (c), (d) and (e) of\nthis section, contracts or arrangements shall be authorized as reasonably\nrelated to the purposes of the ACO and contemporaneously documented by the\ngoverning body of the ACO and a description of the contract or arrangement\nshall be publicly disclosed; (1)\n\nThe\ndocumentation must be made available to the appropriate governmental agencies\nupon request and include the following: (i) A\ndescription of the contract or arrangement including all parties to the\narrangement; (ii)\n\nThe date and\npurpose of the contract or arrangement; (iii)\n\nThe items, services, facilities, and/or\ngoods covered by the contract or arrangement (including non-medical items, services, facilities or goods); (iv)\n\nThe financial or economic terms of the\narrangement; and\n(v) The date and\nmanner of the governing body's authorization of the contract or arrangement\nincluding the basis that the contract or arrangement is reasonably related to\nthe purposes of the ACO. (2)\n\nThe public disclosure shall be posted on\nthe ACO's website within 60 days of the governing body's authorization and\nshall not contain the financial or economic terms of the contract or\narrangement. Other proprietary or confidential business terms may also be\nomitted. The website posting must be such that generally used internet search\nengines will produce results listing the ACO's required\ndisclosure. (f) The\nprovision of health care services directly or indirectly by an ACO certified\npursuant to this Part shall not be considered the practice of a profession\nunder Title 8 of the Education Law.
