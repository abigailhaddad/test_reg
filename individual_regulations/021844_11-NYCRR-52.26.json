Changes in existing policies must be accompanied, where appropriate, by a suitable adjustment in the premiums. (c) Policies may provide for the exclusion of Medicare benefits when coverage continues beyond the covered person's eligibility for Medicare benefits, provided appropriate adjustment is made in the premium. (d) Where group coverage terminates upon retirement, insurers may insert a Medicare exclusion applicable to employees who continue to work after the date of eligibility for Medicare.
