Tit. 21 § 1551.5 - Responsibilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon initiation\nof a type I project, the SUCF general manager shall direct that an\nenvironmental impact assessment form be prepared. The completed environmental\nimpact assessment form shall be reviewed by an environmental quality review\ncommittee (hereinafter referred to as \"the committee\"), whose membership shall\ninclude: one appointee of the SUNY vice chancellor for capital facilities and\ntwo appointees of the SUCF general manager. (b) The environmental impact assessment form\nshall contain sufficient information for the committee to conduct an\nenvironmental analysis to determine whether the project may or will not have a\nsignificant effect on the environment, and will include identification of those\nother agencies, including Federal agencies, which have a relationship to the\nproject. (c) Programmatic or generic\nenvironmental impact statements, master or campuswide statements or statements\nfor comprehensive campus plans may be appropriate for use by the committee to\nassess the environmental effects of (1) a number of separate projects in a\ngiven campus area which, if considered singly may have minor effects, but if\nconsidered together may have significant effects, (2) a chain of contemplated\nprojects, (3) separate projects having generic or common impacts, or (4)\nprograms or plans having wide application or restricting the range of future\nalternative policies or projects. Such statements will eliminate multiple\nsequential reviews of the same or similar actions. No further EIS's need be\nprepared for projects which are included in such a statement. (d) However, amendments or supplements to\nsuch statements must be prepared to reflect impacts which are not addressed or\nadequately analyzed in such a statement as initially prepared. The public and\nother agencies shall be informed of such additions through the same\nnotification channels specified in section\n1551.6\nof this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
