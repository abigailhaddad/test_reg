Tit. 20 §§ 1-1.14 - Taxpayer\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, sections 208(2), 209(3)\n(a) The term \"taxpayer\" means any corporation\nthat is subject to the tax imposed by article 9-A. (b) The term \"taxpayer\" also includes a\nreceiver, referee, trustee, assignee or other fiduciary, or any officer or\nagent appointed by state or Federal court, who conducts the business of a\ncorporation. For example, a trustee who, under the authority of a Federal\ncourt, conducts the business of a corporation in bankruptcy is a taxpayer\nsubject to tax. If the activities of the trustee are limited to the liquidation\nof the business and the disposition of the assets of the corporation, neither\nthe trustee nor the corporation is subject to the franchise tax.
