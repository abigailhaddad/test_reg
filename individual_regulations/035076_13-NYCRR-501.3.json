(2)\nA \"finding of any violation\" shall not\ninclude preliminary relief granted based on a likelihood of success on the\nmerits and/or a weighing of relative harms. (3)\nA consent decree or other executed\nwritten agreement shall be deemed to be based upon a finding of a violation, and thus may subject the political subdivision to preclearance coverage, if the\nagreement contains a finding of noncompliance with one of the laws or\nconstitutional provisions enumerated in sections\n17-210(3)(a) and\n(b) of the Election Law, and contains no\nprovision denying liability with respect to such laws or constitutional\nprovisions.

(d) A\npolitical subdivision that is deemed a covered entity solely on the basis of\ncontaining a covered entity fully within its borders, pursuant to section\n17-210(3)(e)\nof the\n\nElection Law, shall be required to submit covered policies for preclearance\nonly to the extent that such policies affect elections held in the covered\nentity that is contained within such political subdivision's borders.
