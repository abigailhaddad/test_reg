  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 30-2.5 - Standards and criteria for conducting annual professional performance reviews of building principals under Education Law section 3012-d\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Ratings. Annual professional performance reviews conducted under\nthis section shall differentiate principal effectiveness resulting in a\nprincipal being rated highly effective, effective, developing or ineffective\nbased on multiple measures in the following two categories: the student\nperformance category and the school visit category. (b) Student performance\ncategory. Such category shall have at least one mandatory first\nsubcomponent and an optional second subcomponent as follows: (1)\n\nMandatory first subcomponent. (i) for a principal with at least 30 percent\nof his/her students covered under the State-provided growth measure, such\nprincipal shall have a State-provided growth score based on such model; and\n(ii)\nfor a principal where less\nthan 30 percent of his/her students are covered under the State-provided growth\nmeasure, such principal shall have a student learning objective (SLO), on a\nform prescribed by the commissioner, consistent with the SLO process determined\nor developed by the commissioner, that results in a student growth score; provided that, for any principal whose building or program includes courses\nthat end in a State-created or administered assessment for which there is no\n\nState-provided growth model, such assessment must be used as the underlying\nassessment for such SLO. Provided, however, that during the 2015-16 school\nyear, while the department transitions to a new computer based examination, the\ndistrict shall determine whether to use the New York State Alternate Assessment\n(NYSAA) as the underlying assessment for such SLO. In instances where a\ndistrict determines not to use the NYSAA, the district must determine whether\nto use SLOs based on a list of approved student assessments, or a district-\nor-BOCES-wide or school- or program-wide group, team, or linked results based\non State/Regents assessments, or other assessments approved by the department, as defined by the commissioner in guidance. The SLO process determined by the\ncommissioner shall include a minimum growth target of one year of expected\ngrowth, as determined by the superintendent or his or her designee. Such\ntargets, as determined by the superintendent or his or her designee, may take\nthe following characteristics into account: poverty, students with\ndisabilities, English language learners status and prior academic history. SLOs\nshall include the following elements, as defined by the commissioner in\nguidance: (a) student population; (b) learning content; (c) interval of instructional time; (d) evidence; (e) baseline; (f) target; (g) criteria for rating a principal highly\neffective, effective, developing or ineffective (HEDI); and\n(h) rationale; (iii)\nfor a principal of a building or\nprogram whose courses do not end in a State-created or administered test or\nwhere a principal growth score is not determined, districts shall use SLOs\nbased on a list of State approved student assessments. SLOs set for courses in\nthe principal's building which do not end in a State-created or administered\ntest may incorporate district or BOCES-wide or school or program-wide results\nfrom State-created or administered tests, or other student assessments approved\nby the department; (iv)\ndistricts\nshall develop back-up SLOs for all principals whose buildings or programs\ncontain courses that end in a State-created or administered test for which\nthere is a State-provided growth model, to use in the event that no\n\nState-provided growth score can be generated for such\nprincipals. (2)\n\nOptional\nsecond subcomponent. A district may select one or more other measures for the\nstudent performance category that shall be applied in a consistent manner, to\nthe extent practicable, across the district based on either: (i) a second State-provided growth score on a\n\nState-created or administered test; provided that a different measure is used\nthan that for the required subcomponent in the student performance category, which may include one or more of the following measures: (a) principal-specific growth computed by the\n\nState based on percentage of students who achieve a State-determined level of\ngrowth (\ne.g., percentage of students whose growth is above the\nmedian for similar students); (b) district- or BOCES-wide or school- or program-wide growth results using\navailable State-provided growth scores that are locally-computed; or\n(ii)\na growth score based on a\n\nState-designed supplemental assessment, calculated using a State-approved\ngrowth model. Such growth score may include district- or BOCES-wide or school-\nor program-wide group, team, or linked measures where the State-approved growth\nmodel is capable of generating such a score. (3)\n\nAll State-provided or approved growth\nscores must control for poverty, students with disabilities, English language\nlearners status and prior academic history. For SLOs, these characteristics may\nbe taken into account through the use of targets based on one year of expected\ngrowth, as determined by the superintendent or his or her designee. (4)\n\nThe district shall measure student growth\nusing the same measure(s) of student growth for all building principals within\nthe same building configuration or program. (c) Weighting of subcomponents within\nstudent performance category. (1)\n\nIf a\ndistrict does not locally select to use the optional second student growth\nsubcomponent, then the mandatory subcomponent shall be weighted at 100\npercent. (2)\n\nIf the optional second\nstudent growth subcomponent is selected, then the mandatory subcomponent shall\nbe weighted at a minimum of 50 percent and the optional second subcomponent\nshall be weighted at no more than 50 percent. (3)\n\nEach measure used in the student\nperformance category (State provided growth score, SLOs, State-designed\nsupplemental assessments) must result in a score between 0 and 20. The State\nwill generate scores of 0-20 for measures using a State-provided growth score. Districts shall calculate growth scores for SLOs in accordance with the minimum\npercentages prescribed in the table below; provided however that for principals\nof a building or program with small \"n\" sizes as defined by the commissioner in\nguidance, districts shall calculate scores for SLOs using a methodology\nprescribed by the commissioner in guidance and for principals in the City\n\nSchool District of the City of New York, districts shall calculate scores for\nSLOs using the methodology approved by the commissioner in its APPR plan. For\nall other measures that are not State-provided growth measures, scores of 0-20\nshall be computed locally in accordance with the State provided or approved\ngrowth model used.

Multiple measures shall be combined using a weighted average, to\nproduce an overall student performance category score of 0 to 20. Based on such\nscore, an overall student performance category rating shall be derived from the\ntable below: Overall Student Performance Category Score and\n\nRating\n\nMinimum\n\nMaximum\nH\n18\n20\nE\n15\n17\nD\n13\n14\nI\n0\n12\n(d) Principal school visits\ncategory. The school visits category for principals shall be based on\na State-approved rubric and shall include up to three subcomponents; two of\nwhich are mandatory and one of which is optional. (1)\n\nTwo mandatory subcomponents. A district\nshall evaluate a principal based on at least: (i) one school visit shall be based on a\n\nState-approved principal practice rubric conducted by the building principal's\nsupervisor or other trained administrator; and\n(ii)\na second school visit shall be conducted\nby either one or more impartial independent trained evaluator(s) selected and\ntrained by the district or in cases where a hardship waiver is granted by the\ndepartment pursuant to clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph, a\nsecond school visit shall be conducted by one or more evaluators selected and\ntrained by the district, who are different than the evaluator(s) who conducted\nthe evaluation pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph; or in cases\nwhere a hardship waiver is granted by the department pursuant to clause\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph, a second school visit shall be\nconducted as prescribed in clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph. An\nindependent trained evaluator may be employed within the district, but may not\nbe assigned to the same school building as the principal being evaluated; (a) a rural school district, as defined by\nthe commissioner in guidance, or a school district with only one registered\nschool pursuant to section\n100.18\nof the commissioner's\nregulations may apply to the department for a hardship waiver on an annual\nbasis, in a timeframe and manner prescribed by the commissioner, if due to the\nsize and limited resources of the school district, it is unable to obtain an\nindependent evaluator within a reasonable proximity without an undue burden to\nthe school district; (b) commencing\nwith the 2016-2017 school year, a school district may apply to the department\nfor a hardship waiver on an annual basis, on a form and in a timeframe\nprescribed by the commissioner, if the school district believes that compliance\nwith this clause would create an undue burden on the district in one or more of\nthe following areas: compliance with the independent evaluator requirement\nwould result in financial hardship; the district lacks professionally trained\nstaff to comply with the independent evaluator requirement; the district has a\nlarge number of principals; and/or compliance with the independent evaluator\nrequirement could impact safety and management of a building. A hardship waiver\ngranted by the department under this clause shall excuse, but not prohibit, school districts from conducting school visits by impartial independent trained\nevaluators for principals who received a rating of highly effective, effective, or developing in the preceding school year (\ne.g., school\ndistricts would be excused, but not prohibited, from conducting school visits\nby impartial independent trained evaluators for the 2016-2017 school year for\nprincipals who receive a rating of highly effective, effective, or developing\nfor the 2015-2016 school year; school districts would be required to conduct\nschool visits by impartial independent trained evaluators for the 2016-2017\nschool year for, at a minimum, principals who receive a rating of ineffective\nfor the 2015-2016 school year). For principals who are excused from the\nimpartial independent trained evaluator requirement pursuant to a hardship\nwaiver granted by the department under this clause, school districts shall\nconduct a second school visit, provided that such second school visit may be\nconducted by the principal's supervisor or any individual selected and trained\nby the school district. The two school visits for such principals could be\nperformed by the same individual. As part of its hardship waiver request, a\nschool district shall submit a plan for conducting school visits by the\nprincipal's supervisor or other individual selected and trained by the school\ndistrict in lieu of the impartial independent trained evaluator subcomponent. For the other principals in the district who must still receive a second school\nvisit by an impartial, independent trained evaluator (principals who, at a\nminimum, received an ineffective rating in the preceding school year), the\ndistrict must submit a plan for conducting such school visits. Once a hardship\nwaiver is approved by the department, it shall be considered part of the school\ndistrict's annual professional performance review plan for such school\nyear. (2)\n\nOptional third subcomponent. The school visit category may also include a third\noptional subcomponent based on school visits conducted by a trained peer\nadministrator rated effective or highly effective on his or her overall rating\nin the prior school year from the same or another school in the\ndistrict. (3)\n\nFrequency and\nduration of school visits. The frequency of school visits shall be established\nlocally. (4)\n\nAll school visits must\nbe conducted using a principal practice rubric approved by the commissioner\npursuant to an RFQ process, unless the district has a currently approved\nvariance from the commissioner. (i) Variance\nfor existing rubric. A variance may be granted to a district that seeks to use\na rubric that is either a close adaptation of a rubric on the approved list, or\na rubric that was self-developed or developed by a third-party, upon a finding\nby the commissioner that the rubric meets the criteria described in the RFQ, and the district has demonstrated that it has made a significant investment in\nthe rubric and has a history of use that would justify continuing the use of\nthat rubric. (ii)\n\nVariance for use\nof new innovative rubrics. A variance may be granted to a district that seeks\nto use a newly developed rubric, upon a finding by the commissioner that the\nrubric meets the criteria described in the RFQ and the district has\ndemonstrated how it will ensure inter-rater reliability and the rubric's\nability to provide differentiated results over time. (5)\n\nAll school visits for a principal for the\nyear must use the same approved rubric; provided that districts may locally\ndetermine whether to use different rubrics for a principal assigned to\ndifferent grade level configurations or building types. (6)\n\nAt least one of the mandatory school\nvisits must be unannounced. (7)\n\nSchool visits may not be conducted via video. (8)\n\nNothing in this Subpart shall be\nconstrued to limit the discretion of a board of education, superintendent of\nschools, or other trained administrator from conducting school visits of a\nprincipal in addition to those required under this section for non-evaluative\npurposes. (9)\n\nSchool visits may be\nbased only on observable rubric subcomponents. (10)\n\nThe evaluator may select a limited\nnumber of observable rubric subcomponents for focus on within a particular\nschool visit, so long as all observable leadership standards are addressed\nacross the total number of annual school visits. (11)\n\nLeadership standards and their related\nfunctions that are part of the rubric but not observable during the course of\nthe school visit may be observed through other natural conversations between\nthe principal and the evaluator and incorporated into the observation\nscore. (12)\n\nPoints shall not be\nallocated based on any artifacts, unless such artifact constitutes evidence of\na rubric subcomponent observed during a school visit. Points shall not be\nallocated based on professional goal-setting; however, organizational\ngoal-setting may be used to the extent it is evidence from the school visit and\nrelated to a component of the principal practice rubric. (13)\n\nEach subcomponent of the school visit\ncategory shall be evaluated on a 1-4 scale based on a State-approved rubric\naligned to the leadership standards and an overall score for the school visit\ncategory shall be generated between 1-4. Such subcomponent scores must\nincorporate all evidence collected and observed over the course of the school\nyear in that subcomponent. Scores for each subcomponent of the school visit\ncategory shall be combined using a weighted average, producing an overall\nschool visit category score between 1-4. In the event that a principal earns a\nscore of 1 on all rated components of the practice rubric across all school\nvisits, a score of 0 will be assigned. Weighting of Subcomponents with\n\nPrincipal School Visit Category. The weighting of the subcomponents with the\nprincipal school visit category shall be established locally within the\nfollowing constraints: (i) school visits\nconducted by a superintendent or other trained administrator shall be weighted\nat a minimum of 80 percent. (ii)\nschool visits conducted by independent impartial trained evaluators or other\nevaluators selected by the district if a hardship waiver is granted, shall be\nweighted at a minimum of 10 percent. (iii)\nif a district selects to use the\noptional third school visit subcomponent, then the weighting assigned to the\noptional school visits conducted by peers shall be established locally within\nthe constraints outlined in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph. (14)\n\nOverall\nrating on the principal school visits category. The overall principal school\nvisit score shall be converted into an overall rating, using cut scores\ndetermined locally for each rating category; provided that such cut scores\nshall be consistent with the permissible ranges identified below: (15)\n\nThe overall principal/school visit score\nshall be converted into an overall rating, using cut scores determined locally\nfor each rating category; provided that such cut scores shall be consistent\nwith the permissible ranges identified below: Overall Observation Category Score and\n\nRating\n\nMin\n\nMax\nH\n3.5 to 3.75\n4.0\nE\n2.5 to 2.75\n3.49 to 3.74\nD\n1.5 to 1.75\n2.49 to 2.74\nI\n0\n1.49 to 1.74\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
