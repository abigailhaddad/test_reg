Tit. 10 § 405.13 - Anesthesia services\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf anesthesia services are provided within a hospital, the hospital shall develop, implement and keep current effective written\npolicies and procedures regarding staff privileges consistent with provisions\nset forth in section\n405.4\nof this Part, the\nadministration of anesthetics, the maintenance of safety controls and the\nintegration of such services with other related services of the hospital to\nprotect the health and safety of the patients in accordance with generally\naccepted standards of medical practice and patient care. Such policies and\nprocedures shall be reviewed and updated as necessary, but at a minimum\nbiennially. Hospitals providing living liver donor transplants shall also\ncomply with the provisions contained in section\n405.31\n(p)(2)\nof\nthis Part. (a) Organization and\ndirection. Anesthesia services shall be directed by a physician who\nhas responsibility for the clinical aspects of organization and delivery of all\nanesthesia services provided by the hospital.

(2)\n\nAnesthesia service policies shall clearly outline requirements for orientation\nand continuing education programs for all staff, and staff compliance with such\nrequirements shall be considered at the time of reappointment or performance\nevaluation. Such training, clinical competencies and continuing education\nprograms shall be established that are relevant to care provided but must, at a\nminimum, include instruction in safety precautions, equipment usage and\ninspections, infection control requirements and any patients' rights\nrequirements pertaining to surgical/anesthesia consents. (3)\n\nThe director shall, in conjunction with\nthe medical staff, monitor the quality and appropriateness of anesthesia\nrelated patient care and ensure that identified problems are reported to the\nquality assurance committee and are resolved. (b) Operation and service\ndelivery. Policies governing anesthesia services shall be designed\nto ensure the achievement and maintenance of generally accepted standards of\nmedical practice and patient care. (1)\n\nAll anesthesia machines shall be numbered and reports of all equipment\ninspections and routine maintenance shall be included in the anesthesia service\nrecords. Policies and procedures shall be developed and implemented regarding\nnotification of equipment disorders/malfunctions to the director, to the\nmanufacturer and, in accordance with section\n405.8\nof this Part, to the\ndepartment. (2)\n\nWritten policies\nregarding anesthesia procedures shall be developed and implemented which shall\nclearly delineate pre-anesthesia and post-anesthesia responsibilities. These\npolicies shall include, but not be limited to, the following elements: (i) Pre-anesthesia physical evaluations shall\nbe performed by an individual qualified to administer anesthesia and recorded\nwithin 48 hours, prior to surgery. (ii)\n\nRoutine checks shall be conducted by the\nanesthetist prior to every administration of anesthesia to ensure the\nreadiness, availability, cleanliness, sterility when required, and working\ncondition of all equipment used in the administration of anesthetic\nagents. (iii)\n\nAll anesthesia care\nshall be provided in accordance with generally accepted standards of practice\nand shall ensure the safety of the patient during the administration, conduct\nof and emergence from anesthesia. The following continuous monitoring is\nrequired during the administration of general and regional anesthetics. Such\ncontinuous monitoring is not required during the administration of anesthetics\nadministered for analgesia or during the administration of local anesthetics\nunless medically indicated. (a) An\nanesthetist shall be continuously present in the operating room throughout the\nadministration and the conduct of all general anesthetics, regional\nanesthetics, and monitored anesthesia care. If there is a documented hazard to\nthe anesthetist which prevents the anesthetist from being continuously present\nin the operating room, provision must be made for monitoring the\npatient. (b) All patients must be\nattended by the anesthetist during the emergence from anesthesia until they are\nunder the care of qualified post-anesthesia care staff or longer as necessary\nto meet the patient's needs.

Such equipment or superior equipment shall be obtained and utilized by the\nhospital. (d) During the\nadministration and conduct of all anesthesia services the patient's oxygenation\nshall be continuously monitored to ensure adequate oxygen concentration in the\ninspired gas and the blood through the use of a pulse oximeter or superior\nequipment that is age and size appropriate. During every administration of\ngeneral anesthesia using an anesthesia machine, the concentration of oxygen in\nthe patient's breathing system shall be measured by an oxygen analyzer with a\nlow oxygen concentration limit alarm. (e) All patients' ventilation shall be\ncontinuously monitored during the conduct of anesthesia. During regional\nanesthesia, monitored anesthesia care and general anesthesia with a mask, the\nadequacy of ventilation shall be evaluated through the continual observation of\nthe patient's qualitative clinical signs. For every patient receiving general\nanesthesia with an endotracheal tube, the quantitative carbon dioxide content\nof expired gases shall be monitored through the use of endtidal carbon dioxide\nanalysis or superior technology. In all cases where ventilation is controlled\nby a mechanical ventilator, there shall be in continuous use an alarm that is\ncapable of detecting disconnection of any components of the breathing\nsystem. (f) The patient's\ncirculatory functions shall be continuously monitored during all anesthetics. This monitoring shall include the continuous display of the patient's\nelectrocardiogram, from the beginning of anesthesia until preparation to leave\nthe anesthetizing location, and the evaluation of the patient's blood pressure\nand heart rate at least every five minutes. (g) During every administration of\nanesthesia, there shall be immediately available a means to continuously\nmeasure the patient's temperature. (iv)\n\nAll equipment and services provided\nshall be age and size appropriate. (v) Intraoperative anesthesia records shall\ndocument all pertinent events that occur during the induction, maintenance, and\nemergence from anesthesia. These pertinent events shall include, but not be\nlimited to, the following: intraoperative abnormalities or complications, blood\npressure, pulse, dosage and duration of all anesthetic agents, dosage and\nduration of other drugs and intravenous fluids, and the administration of blood\nand blood components.
