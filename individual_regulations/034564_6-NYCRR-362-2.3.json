  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 362-2.3 - Design and operating requirements\n\nState Regulations\nA facility required to obtain a permit under this Subpart\nmust, in addition to the requirements identified in Part 360 of this Title, design, construct, maintain, and operate the facility in compliance with the\nfollowing criteria: (a) The facility\nmust accept and process only MSW. (b) Source-separated recyclables, source-separated household hazardous waste, source-separated electronic waste, source-separated rechargeable batteries, source-separated mercury-containing\nproducts, and other source-separated items that are subject to legislatively\nenacted stewardship programs in the State must not be accepted for treatment, except at facilities that are approved by the department to accept only\nsource-separated recyclables as feedstocks. Facilities must not accept\nsource-separated recyclables as feedstock unless, at the time of permitting, that feedstock has no recycling market as determined by the department. Viability of recycling markets will be evaluated at the time of each permit\nrenewal. (c) Friable\nasbestos-containing waste must not be accepted at the facility. (d) Radioactive waste detection procedures\nand requirements. (1)\nA fixed radiation\ndetection unit must be installed and operated at a location appropriate for the\nmonitoring of all incoming waste. (2)\n\nThe concentration of radium-226 in any\nwaste treated at the facility must not exceed 25 pCi/g however waste which\ntriggers the radiation detector can be accepted and evaluated according to the\nfacility's waste control plan in order to determine whether or not the waste\nmay be accepted at the facility. (3)\n\nThe investigation alarm setpoint of the\nradiation detector must be set at least two times, but no greater than five\ntimes, site background radiation levels. (4)\n\nBackground radiation readings at the\nfacility must be measured and recorded at least daily. (5)\n\nField checks of the radiation detector\nutilizing a known radiation source must be performed and recorded at least\nweekly. (6)\n\nThe radiation detector\nmust be calibrated at least annually or more often as recommended by the\nmanufacturer, and documentation describing the calibration must be maintained\nat the facility. (7)\n\nEach instance\nin which the radiation detector is triggered by a waste load must be documented\nand reported to the department within 24 hours. Recorded information must\ninclude the date the waste was received, transporter name, origin of the waste, truck number or other identifying marking, detector reading, disposition of the\nwaste, and date of disposition. (8)\n\nStaff training related to radiation detection system operating procedures and\nradiation investigation alarm response procedures must be conducted at least\nannually. (e) All\ntipping, sorting, processing, compaction, storage, and related activities must\nbe conducted in an enclosed building with adequate odor controls, provided, however, that nonputrescible waste or processed recyclables can be stored in\noutdoor areas in closed containers or covered trailers in accordance with\nsubdivisions (h), (i), and (j) of this section. (f) The processing, storage, loading, and\nunloading areas must be constructed of concrete or asphalt paving material and\nequipped with adequate drainage structures that are directed to enclosed tanks\nthat meet the requirements of subdivision\n360.19\n(n) of this\n\nTitle or a sanitary sewer system. (g) The area designated for unloading of all\nincoming loads (tipping floor) must be cleaned at the end of each operating day\nunless otherwise approved by the department. (h) Refuse-derived fuels and processed\nrecyclables must be stored separately and maintained in a manner that ensures\nmarketability is not adversely affected. (i) No waste can be stored unprocessed for\nmore than three calendar days. All residue or refuse-derived fuel must be\nremoved from the facility whenever storage capacity is reached or within three\ncalendar days of processing, whichever comes first. (j) Processed recyclables can be stored for a\nmaximum of 60 calendar days unless the following criteria are satisfied to\njustify a longer storage period, though in no case can the storage period\nexceed 180 calendar days: (1)\nthere is a\ndemonstrated need to store for a longer period, such as a market agreement with\nterms of receipt based on greater than 60-day intervals or volumes that can\ntake longer than 60 days to acquire; (2)\nthe facility has sufficient storage area\nto accommodate the amount of waste that will accumulate during the extended\nstorage period; (3)\nthe facility\nimplements an inventory control system, including daily logs, to ensure that\nthe processed recyclables do not remain at the facility for longer than the\nperiod approved; and\n(4)\nthe\nfacility notifies the department of their proposal to store processed\nrecyclables for greater than 60 days and includes justification based on the\nrequirements of this subdivision and obtains approval from the department. (k) The facility\nmaintains financial assurance in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of\nclosure of the facility as specified by sections\n360.21\nand\n360.22\nof this\n\nTitle. Notes\nN.Y.
