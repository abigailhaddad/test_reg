  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 890.12 - Coordinated operation of reservoirs during a lower basin drought warning and drought\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Banking and use of excess release quantity: New York City\nreservoirs. Prior to June 15 of each year and at any time the\nhydrologic conditions so warrant, the parties to the 1954 Supreme Court Decree, the Delaware River Basin Commission and the Delaware River Master will review\nexisting conditions in the basin and shall determine whether or not to bank the\n\"excess release quality\" provided pursuant to Section III, B.1.C of the Decree, as calculated for the seasonal period beginning June 15 and ending the\nfollowing March 15, for possible use to prevent lower basin \"drought\" or to\nprovide lower basin \"drought\" assistance. Relevant factors to be considered\ninclude precipitation in the basin, climatic predictions, streamflows, ground\nwater levels, soil moisture and other hydrologic date in making the\ndetermination with respect to the banking and use of the \"excess release\nquantity.\" The \"excess release quantity\" shall be reserved and placed in an\n\"excess release bank\" if the parties to the 1954 Decree, Delaware River Basin\n\nCommission and the River Master determine that \"drought\" conditions in the\nlower basin are expected or threatening. If the \"excess release quantity\" is\nreserved and banked, the excess release provisions set forth in Section\nIII.b.1.d of the Supreme Court Decree shall be deemed suspended for the balance\nof that water year beginning June 1 and ending May 31. The \"excess release\nbank\" shall be used, during that water year, to provide lower basin \"drought\"\nassistance releases to the Delaware River designed to assist in meeting the\n\nTrenton flow objective for lower basin \"normal\" conditions, or 3,000 cfs. Such\nlower basin \"drought\" assistance releases shall be made in quantities and at\nsuch times as determined by the Delaware River Basin Commission, and directed\nby the Delaware River Master. The lower basin \"drought\" assistance releases\nshall be made provided that the total combined storage available in the New\n\nYork City Delaware River Basin reservoirs exceed the \"drought warning\" criteria\nset forth in Figure 1 of section\n890.9\nof this Part. The total\nlower basin releases made from the New York City Delaware Basin reservoirs\nduring any water operations year under the provision of this section shall not\nexceed the total quantity available in the \"excess release bank\" available\nduring that same period. If, while banking excess releases, augmented\nconservation releases from the New York City Delaware River Basin reservoirs\nare made that would have been credited towards the \"excess release quantity\" in\nthe absence of banking, then that amount of augmented conservation release\nshall be deducted from the \"excess release bank.\"\n(b) Operations during lower basin\n\"normal\" conditions. When basinwide conditions are \"normal\" and lower basin\nconditions are \"normal\" (as defined by Beltzville Reservoir storage above\nelevation 615 m.s.l. and Blue Marsh Reservoir storage above elevation 283\nm.s.l.), the following provisions shall govern lower basin operations: (1)\n\nNew Jersey diversion. Diversions by the State of New Jersey during \"normal\"\nperiods, shall be computed as provided in section V.B. of the amended\n\nDecree of the U.S. Supreme Court in New Jersey\nv. New\n\nYork, 347 U.S. 995\n(1954)\nand its total diversion without compensating\nreleases shall not exceed 100 million gallons per day (mgd) as a monthly\naverage, with the diversion on any day not to exceed 120 million gallons, and\nits total diversion without compensating releases shall not exceed an average\nof 100 mgd during any calendar year. (2)\n\nTrenton flow objective. The minimum streamflow objective at the U.S.G.S. gaging\nstation located at Trenton, NJ, shall be 3,000 cfs. (3)\n\nPriority of releases. Releases shall be made from storage to maintain the\nminimum Trenton streamflow objective of 3,000 cfs in such quantities and at\nsuch times as determined by the Delaware River Basin Commission, and, in the\ncase of the New York City reservoirs, as directed by the Delaware River Master, in the following order of priority: (i) Releases from the \"excess release bank\"\nin the New York City Delaware Basin reservoirs, if available as provided under\nsubdivision (a) of this plan. (ii)\n\nReleases from Beltzville Reservoir from storage between elevations 628 and 615\nm.s.l. (73.7% of storage remaining), and/or releases from Blue Marsh Reservoir\nfrom storage between elevations 290 and 283 m.s.l. (68.9% of storage\nremaining). Releases may be made from either or both reservoirs considering\nwate quality needs in the Lehigh and Schuylkill Rivers. (c) Operations during lower\nbasin \"drought warning\" conditions. When the storage in Beltzville Reservoir falls below\nelevation 615 m.s.l. (73.7% of storage capacity) and the storage in Blue Marsh\n\nReservoir falls below elevation 283 m.s.l. (68.9% of storage capacity) the\n\nDelaware River Basin Commission shall declare a \"drought warning\" condition in\nthe lower basin, and the following operating provisions and actions shall\nautomatically be placed in effect: (1)\n\nNew Jersey diversion. The total diversion by the State of New Jersey during\nlower basin \"drought warning\" conditions in the lower basin shall be computed\nas a daily running average, commencing on the day such \"drought warning\"\nbecomes effective. The total diversion by New Jersey shall not exceed a running\naverage of 70 mgd with the diversion on any day not to exceed 120 million\ngallons per day. If the allowable diversion for any condition period following\nentry into \"drought warning\" operations is not fully used, the unused portion\nmay not be credited or used during subsequent periods. (2)\n\nTrenton flow objective. During lower basin \"drought warning\" periods, the minimum\nstreamflow objective at the U.S.G.S. gaging station located at Trenton, NJ, shall be established as set forth in Table 2 of section\n890.9\nof this Part, in accordance\nwith the seven-day average location of the 250-mg/l isochlor (the \"salt front\")\nin the Delaware Estuary. (3)\n\nPriority of releases. Releases shall be made from storage to maintain the\nminimum streamflow objectives set forth in Table 2 of section\n890.9\nof this Part, in such\nquantities and at such times as determined by the Delaware River Basin\n\nCommission, and in the case of the New York City reservoirs, as directed by the\n\nDelaware River Master, in the following order of priority: (i) Releases from the \"excess release bank\"\nin the New York City Delaware River Basin Reservoirs, if available, as provided\nunder subdivision (a) of this section. Because the \"excess release bank\" will\nhave been used under lower basin \"normal\" conditions, it would only be\navailable in the second or a subsequent year of a lower basin \"drought\" and\nlower basin \"drought warning.\"\n(ii)\n\nReleases from Beltzville Reservoir from storage between elevations 615 to 590\nm.s.l. (38% of storage remaining), and/or releases from Blue Marsh Reservoir\nfrom storage between elevations 283 and 273 m.s.l. (36.8% of storage\nremaining). Releases may be made from either or both reservoirs, considering\nwater quality needs in the Lehigh and Schuylkill Rivers. (4)\n\nReduction of conservation releases. In order to conserve storage, conservation releases from\nthe listed lower basin reservoirs shall be modified as set forth in Table 4 of\nsection\n890.9\nof this Part commencing with\nthe declaration of a lower basin \"drought warning\" condition. (5)\n\nConservation measures. The Delaware River Basin Commission and the lower basin\nstates will implement and encourage concerted voluntary water conservation\nmeasures and programs during the lower basin \"drought warning\"\ncondition. (6)\n\nConsultation\nby decree parties, the Delaware River Basin Commission, and Delaware River\n\nMaster. Within 30 days following triggering of lower basin \"drought warning\"\nconditions, the Delaware River Basin Commission shall convene the authorized\nrepresentatives of the States of Delaware, New Jersey and New York, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, City of New York and the Delaware River Master to\nreview current conditions and to consider and determine actions to be\nimplemented in the event of lower basin \"drought\" emergency conditions declared\npursuant to article 10.4 of the compact. (7)\n\nEnding lower basin \"drought warning.\"\nWhen the storage levels in Beltzville and Blue Marsh Reservoirs simultaneously\nexceed their respective lower basin \"drought warning\" storage levels for 30\nconsecutive days, or when either of those reservoirs spills, the lower basin\n\"drought warning\" operation shall automatically terminate and \"normal\"\noperations shall be resumed, unless the commission unanimously agrees\notherwise. (d) Operations during lower basin \"drought\" conditions. When storage in Beltzville Reservoir falls below\nelevation 590 m.s.l. (38.0% of storage capacity) and storage in Blue Marsh\n\nReservoir falls below elevation 273 m.s.l. (36.8% of capacity) and remains\nbelow such levels for three consecutive days, the Delaware River Basin\n\nCommission shall, pursuant to article 10.4 of the compact, declare a lower\nbasin \"drought\" emergency condition in the lower basin and the following\nprovisions shall automatically be placed in effect: (1)\n\nNew Jersey diversion. The total diversion by New Jersey during lower basin\ndrought conditions shall not exceed a running average of 65 mgd, for the\ncontinuous period commencing on the first day following declaration of the\nlower basin \"drought,\" with the diversion on any day not to exceed 120\nmgd. (2)\n\nTrenton flow\nobjective. During lower basin \"drought\" conditions, the minimum\nstreamflow objective at the U.S.G.S. gaging station located at Trenton, NJ\nshall be established as set forth in Table 2 of section\n890.9\nof this Part in accordance\nwith the seven-day average location of the 250 mgl isochlor (the \"salt front\")\nin the Delaware estuary. (3)\n\nReservoir operations. (i) If not previously\nagreed to, within three days following the triggering of lower basin \"drought\"\nconditions, the parties to the 1954 Decree in consultation with the Delaware\n\nRiver Basin Commission, shall consider and unanimously select, and the Delaware\n\nRiver Basin Commission shall implement, one of the six lower basin \"drought\"\nreservoir operations plans set forth in subdivision (e) of this section, or any\nother plan designed to meet then existing conditions. The parties may by\nunanimous agreement modify and adjust any such operations plan or plans as\nnecessary and appropriate to reflect actual conditions and needs. (ii)\n\nThe lower basin \"drought\" reservoir\noperations plans shall consider and include provision of staged releases, as\nappropriate, from the following storage: (a) Beltzville Reservoir storage between elevations 590 and 537 m.s.l. (4.65\nbillion gallons). (b) Blue Marsh\n\nReservoir storage between elevations 273 and 261 m.s.l. (1.77 billion\ngallons). (c) Lake Nockamixon\nstorage between elevations 395 and 325.5 m.s.l. (12.97 billion\ngallons). (d) Storage in Lake\n\nWallenpaupack and Mongaup facilities (29.81 and 15.38 billion gallons\nrespectively), subject to the conditions set forth in subparagraph (d)(3)(v) of\nthis section. (e) Any water from\nstorage in the New York City Delaware Basin Reservoirs in excess of 80 billion\ngallons above \"drought warning\" criteria as set forth in Figure 1 of section\n890.9\nof this Part, without\ncompensation. (f) Any water from\nstorage in the New York City Delaware Basin Reservoirs between 65 billion\ngallons and 80 billion gallons above \"drought warning\" criteria as set forth in\n\nFigure 1 of section\n890.9\nof this Part, with\ncompensation for the use of storage between 65 billion gallons and 80 billion\ngallons at the rate of 50% of actual releases made for lower basin \"drought\"\nassistance only if storage drops below the level of 65 billion gallons above\n\"drought warning.\" Credits will be added to the lower basin Drought Assistance\n\nReleases Credit Bank as defined in clause (d)(3)(iv)(\nb\n) of\nthis section and compensated for as provided in clause\n(d)(3)(iv)(\nc\n) of this section. (g) Up to 30 billion gallons from storage in\nthe New York City Delaware Basin Reservoirs between 30 billion gallons and 65\nbillion gallons above \"drought warning\" criteria as set forth in Figure 1 of\nsection\n890.9\nof this Part, subject to the\nconditions set forth in subparagraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section. (h) Available storage in Lake Hopatcong (1.9\nto 4.3 billion gallons) subject to the considerations set forth in subparagraph\n(d)(3)(vi) of this section. (iii)\n\nThe Delaware River Basin Commission, in consultation with the parties to the\n1954 Decree, shall consider requesting the temporary storage of water in\n\nFrancis E. Walter and Prompton Reservoirs for future use. (iv)\n\nNew York City Delaware Basin Reservoirs\n\nOperations. During a lower basin \"drought\" condition, an amount not to exceed\n30 billion gallons of storage between 30 billion gallons and 65 billion gallons\nabove the \"drought warning\" line in the New York City Delaware Basin Reservoirs\nmay be considered for inclusion in the lower basin \"drought\" reservoir\noperations plan to provide lower basin \"drought\" assistance releases to the\n\nDelaware River (in addition to such releases as may be needed to meet the\n\nMontague flow objective), in order to assist in meeting the Trenton flow\nobjectives, subject to the following conditions and limitations: (a) Lower basin \"drought\" assistance releases\nmay be made under this provision provided that the total combined storage\navailable in the New York City Delaware Basin Reservoirs exceeds by 30 billion\ngallons the \"drought warning\" criteria set forth in Figure 1 of section\n890.9\nof this Part. (b) The total quantity of supplemental\nreleases made from the New York City Delaware River Basin reservoirs from\nstorage between 30 billion gallons and 65 billion gallons above \"drought\nwarning\" criteria in any water year shall be credited to the City in a lower\nbasin \"Drought Assistance Releases Credit Bank\" at the rate of 100% of actual\nreleases made. (c) Except as\nprovided in items (\n3\n) and (\n4\n) of this\nsubclause, credits accumulated in the lower basin \"Drought Assistance Releases\n\nCredit Bank\" shall be carried forward to the following water years, and\ncompensated for as follows: (1)\n\nCredits shall\nfirst be used to reduce the \"excess release quantity\" for the water year\nbeginning the following June as provided under section III.B.1.c of the 1954\ndecree. (2)\n\nAny remaining credits\nshall be compensated by a proportionate reduction in the basic Montague flow\nobjective provided under the 1954 Supreme Court decree and section\n2.5.3 of the Compact. The amount\nand timing of such reductions shall be determined by the Delaware River Master, in consultation with the commission and parties to the 1954 decree. To the\nmaximum extent possible and considering the hydrological condition of the New\n\nYork City Delaware River Basin reservoirs and upper basin streamflows, such\ncredits will be worked off on days when releases are required to meet Montague\nflow objectives, and Trenton flows exceed the applicable flow objective without\naugmentation from lower basin storage as ordered by the Delaware River Basin\n\nCommission. (3)\n\nShould any credits\nstill remain at the end of the following water year, the procedure as outlined\nin subclause (d)(3)(iv)(\na\n)(\n1\n) and\n(\n2\n) of this section shall be repeated for subsequent years as\nnecessary to totally deplete the lower basin \"Drought Assistance Releases\n\nCredit Bank\", except as provided in subclause (\n4\n) of this\nclause. (4)\n\nIn the event that any\n\nNew York City Delaware Basin Reservoir refills and spills, all credits\naccumulated in the lower basin \"Drought Assistance Releases Credit Bank\" shall\nbe cancelled. (v) Power reservoir releases. During lower\nbasin \"drought\" condition, the Delaware River Basin Commission may direct\nreleases from storage in Lake Wallenpaupack and the Mongaup facilities\naccording to subparagraphs (d)(3)(i)-(iv) of this section. The commission may\ndelegate to the River Master responsibility for directing operation of the Lake\n\nWallenpaupack and Mongaup facilities under the release schedules and drought\nmanagement policies of the commission. In order to conserve the waters of the\nbasin, releases from Wallenpaupack and Mongaup shall be made only when water is\nneeded to meet Trenton flow objectives. (a) Releases from Lake Wallenpaupack may be directed as needed to meet Trenton flow\nobjectives, provided that elevations do not drop below the elevations listed\nfor the following month according to Table 2 of section\n890.11\nof this Part. (b) Releases from the Mongaup reservoir\nsystem may be directed, as needed to meet Trenton flow objectives, following an\noperations rule curve based upon maximum available storage of 15.38 billion\ngallons for the total system and providing for refilling the system during the\nworst hydrologic year of record, maintaining a minimum release and maintaining\nminimum operating levels. In the absence of an operations rule curve for the\n\nMongaup system, releases shall be made from Mongaup facilities at a ratio of\napproximately 1 to 2 to the quantity of releases directed from Lake\n\nWallenpaupack. (c) If the Montague\nflow objective exceeds the sum of the New York City Delaware River Basin\nreservoir conservation releases plus uncontrolled flow at Montague by 350 cfs\nor more, then 350 cfs from the total Wallenpaupack and Mongaup directed\nreleases shall be credited toward the Montague flow objective, and any\nadditional releases required to meet the Montague flow objective shall be made\nfrom the New York City Delaware River Basin reservoirs. (d) If the Montague flow objective exceeds\nthe sum of New York City Delaware River Basin reservoir conservation releases\nplus uncontrolled flow at Montague by less than 350 cfs, then an amount from\nthe total Wallenpaupack and Mongaup directed releases, which is equal to the\ndifference between the Montague flow objective and the sum of New York City\nconservation releases plus uncontrolled flow at Montague, shall be credited\ntoward the Montague flow objective, and no additional releases shall be\nrequired from the New York City Delaware River Basin reservoirs to meet the\n\nMontague flow objective. (vi)\n\nIn selecting the reservoir operations\nplan and release scheduled to be implemented, the parties will consider the\nfollowing factors: (a) Lake Hopatcong is a\nprivately owned non-utility lake. (b) The water in any reservoir or lake may\nnot be available if under the provisions of a declaration of a drought\nemergency either within or outside of the basin by the Governor of New York, New Jersey, or Pennsylvania, such facility has been identified to provide\nsupplies for essential health and safety purposes. (c) There are flow constraints imposed by the\noutlet works. (d) There are release\nlimitations due to potential flooding conditions downstream. (e) The season and seasonal hydrologic\nconditions. (f) The status of\nstorage and probability of refill or drawdown for each reservoir. (g) The status of demands upon each\nreservoir. (h) The impact of\ndrought operations upon the authorized uses of each reservoir. (i) The condition of other water supplies, storage or sources available to the owners and operators of each\nreservoir. (j) The variable impact\nof observed and expected drought conditions in the drainage areas for each\nreservoir. (k) Salinity intrusion\nin the Delaware estuary. (l) Releases shall be made from storage to maintain the minimum Trenton streamflow\nobjectives set forth in Table 2, of section\n890.9\nof this Part, in such\nquantities and at such times as determined by the Delaware River Basin\n\nCommission, and, in the case of the New York City reservoirs, as directed by\nthe Delaware River Master, in accordance with the schedules and priorities set\nforth in the operating plan selected or modified by the parties under this\nsection. (e) Operations alternatives for lower\nbasin \"drought\" when basinwide conditions are \"normal.\"\nWhen storage in Beltzville Reservoir falls below\nelevation 590 m.s.l. (38.0% of storage capacity) and storage in Blue Marsh\n\nReservoir falls below elevation 273 m.s.l. (36.8% of capacity) and remains\nbelow such levels for three consecutive days, the Delaware River Basin\n\nCommission shall, pursuant to article 10.4 of the Compact, declare a lower\nbasin \"drought\" emergency condition in the lower basin and the following\nprovisions shall automatically be placed in effect: (1)\n\nNew Jersey diversion. The total diversion by New Jersey during lower basin\n\"drought\" conditions shall not exceed a running average of 65 mgd, for the\ncontinuous period commencing on the first day following declaration of the\nlower basin \"drought\", with the diversion on any day not to exceed 120\nmgd. (2)\n\nTrenton flow\nobjective. During lower basin \"drought\" conditions, the minimum\nstreamflow objective at the U.S.G.S. gaging station located at Trenton, NJ\nshall be established as set forth in Table 2 of section\n890.9\nof this Part in accordance\nwith the seven-day average location of the 250 mgl isochlor (the \"salt front\")\nin the Delaware estuary. (3)\n\nOperations alternatives. The alternatives for lower basin \"drought\" operations\npresented herein vary considerably and were specifically designed to be able to\naddress the wide range of conditions which may occur. For example, if a lower\nbasin \"drought\" triggers and the upper basin reservoirs are nearly full, then\nupper basin reservoirs may play a more significant role in helping to solve the\nlower basin crisis. On the other hand, if the lower basin is in a \"drought\"\ncondition and the basin as a whole is about to enter a \"drought warning\"\ncondition, then it would be appropriate to look to other sources such as power\ndams or recreation reservoirs for assistance. In that case, early mobilization\nof these additional sources would significantly reduce the severity of\nbasinwide \"drought\" conditions should they occur. A schematic guide for\nselecting alternatives for lower basin \"drought\" operations is presented in\n\nFigure 1-a of this section. Click\nto view image\n(i) Factors\nwhich would indicate the most favorabhle conditions for each alternative are\npresented below in the column entitled\n\nIndications. The\ncorresponding operations alternatives each present the order of\npriority\n*\nof augmented reservoir releases to\nmaintain Trenton flow objectives and are located in the column entitled\n\nOperations. (a) (a) Alternative\n1. Indications\n\nOperations\n\nApplication of Alternative 1 is\nindicated if the general hydrologic condition of the upper basin is much better\nthan the lower basin, based on various drought indicators, including\nprecipitation, streamflow, ground water levels and reservoir storage. Under\nthese conditions storage in the New York City Delaware River Basin reservoirs\nwould be high (\ni.e., 65 bg above the \"drought warning\" line), with a low projected demand on the reservoirs. Storage in the New York City\nnon-Delaware reservoirs would also be high. 1. Impound and use temporary storage in F.E. Walter\nand Prompton, if available. 2. Make additional releases from New York City\n\nDelaware Reservoir storage in excess of 80 bg above \"drought warning\" without\ncompensation, and in excess of 65 bg above \"drought warning\" with 50%\ncompensation if storage subsequently drops below 65 bg above \"drought warning\", to augment Delaware River flow. 3. Nockamixon from elev. 395 to elev. 385\n(68.7%/4.1bg)**\nUnder these conditions, Alternative 1\ncalls for New York City Delaware storage to be used heavily because there would\nnot be a basinwide \"drought\" condition. This alternative would use water which\nwould otherwise likely spill later during the water year. 4. Make 10 bg of additional releases from New York\n\nCity Delaware Reservoirs*** to augment Delaware River flow. 5. Make total of 5 bg release from Beltzville, Blue\n\nMarsh**** and Nockamixon, at maximum total release rate of 200 cfs, and release\nfrom Lake Hopatcong***** to elev. 919 (1.9 bg) at a maximum release rate of 75\ncfs. 6. Make 10 bg of additional releases from New York\n\nCity Delaware Reservoirs*** to augment Delaware River flow. 7. Make total of bg release from Beltzville, Blue\n\nMarsh ***** and Nockamixon, at maximum total release rate of 200 cfs. 8. Make 10 bg of additional releases from New York\n\nCity Delaware Reservoirs*** to augment Delaware River flow. 9. Make releases from Lake Wallenpaupack subject to\nthe elevation schedule, and make proportional releases from Mongaup\nstorage****** subject to minimum operating levels. 10. Make releases from Beltzville, Blue Marsh****\nand Nockamixon to elev. 537, 261 and 325.5 respectively at maximum total\nrelease rate of 200 cfs, and release from Lake Hopatcong***** to elev. 915.2\n(2.4 bg) at a maximum release rate of 75 cfs. * To be followed after the \"excess\nrelease bank\" has been exhausted. Order of priority would be reversed for\ncoming out of a drought condition. ** Loss of recreation below this\nlevel. *** New York City would be credited\nthis water against the following year's \"excess release quantity\" unless there\nis an intervening spell condition. In addition, these releases would only be\nmade when New York City Delaware reservoir storage is more than 30 billion\ngallons above the \"drought warning\" curve. The maximum cumulative amount of\nthese releases is 30 bg. **** Sufficient storage would be\nretained to supply the needs of the Western Berks Water Authority, required\nconservation releases and water quality augmentation needs on the Schuylkill\n\nRiver. ***** Use of water from Lake Hopatcong\nis subject to the considerations set forth in subsection d3(f). ****** Releases will be made from Lake\n\nWallenpaupack and the Mongaup Power Reservoir System simultaneously and\napproximately in a two to one ratio, respectively. (b) Alternative\n2. Indications\n\nOperations\n\nUse of Alternative 2 is indicated if\nthe general condition in the upper basin is moderately favorable\n(\ni.e., storage at least 30 bg above \"drought warning\" and less\nthan 65 bg above \"drought warning\"). This plan involves extra releases from the\n\nNew York City reservoirs drop to less than 30 bg above \"drought warning,\" then\nreleases from the power dams would be used instead. Because such releases would\ntend to increase the risk of the basin entering \"drought warning,\" this option\nshould only be considered if it triggers after September 1, when the risk of\ndrawing the basin into \"drought warning\" conditions is reduced. This would\nlimit the amount of time water would be needed as well as increase the\nprobability of refill before serious drawdown occurred. 1. Impound and use temporary storage in F.E. Walter\nand Prompton, if available. 2. Nockamixon from elev. 395 to elev. 385\n(68.7%/4.1 bg)**\n3. Make 10 bg of additional releases from New York\n\nCity Delaware reservoirs to augment Delaware River flow. To the extent New York\n\nCity Delaware reservoirs are unavailable, make releases for Trenton from Lake\n\nWallenpaupack subject to the elevation schedule, and make proportional releases\nfrom the Mongaup Power Reservoir System****** subject to minimum operating\nlevels. 4. Make total of 5 bg release from Beltzville, Blue\n\nMarsh**** and Nockamixon at maximum total release rate of 200 cfs, and releases\nfrom Lake Hopatcong***** to elev. 919 (1.9 bg) at a maximum release rate of 75\ncfs. 5. Make 10 bg of additional releases from New York\n\nCity Delaware Reservoirs*** to augment Delaware River flow. To the extent New\n\nYork City reservoirs are unavailable, make releases for Trenton from Lake\n\nWallenpaupack subject to the elevation schedule, and make proportional releases\nfrom the Mongaup Power Reservoir System****** subject to minimum operating\nlevels. 6. Make total of 5 bg release from Beltzville, Blue\n\nMarsh**** and Nockamixon, at maximum total release rate of 200 cfs. 7. Make 10 bg of additional releases from New York\n\nCity Delaware Reservoirs*** to augment Delaware River flow. To the extent New\n\nYork City Delaware reservoirs are unavailable, make releases for Trenton from\n\nLake Wallenpaupack subject to the elevation schedule, and make proportional\nreleases from the Mongaup Power Reservoir System****** subject to minimum\noperating levels. 8. Make releases from Beltzville, Blue Marsh****\nand Nockamixon, to elev. 537, 261 and 325.5 respectively, at maximum total\nrelease rate of 200 cfs, and release from Lake Hopatcong***** to elev. 915.2\n(2.4 bg) at a maximum release rate of 75 cfs. (c) Alternative\n3. Indications\n\nOperations\n\nThis alternative uses only lower basin\nreservoirs (\ni.e., located below Montague) and does not involve\nthe use of New York City or upper basin power reservoirs. This alternative\nprovides the least amount of storage with which to work. Two conditions\ncombined would indicate that application of Alternative 3 is appropriate - (1)\nthe New York City Delaware River Basin reservoirs are very close to entering a\n\"drought warning\" condition (\ni.e., storage in New York City\n\nDelaware reservoirs is less than 30 bg above the \"drought warning\" line when\nlower basin \"drought\" triggers) and the non-Delaware River Basin New York City\nsupplies and low; and (2) the lower basin \"drought\" occurs very late in the\nseason (\ni.e., after November 1). Under these seasonal\nconditions, the likelihood of the lower basin reservoirs emptying before the\nnatural refill period is low, and the required releases most likely can be made\nfrom the limited remaining contents of the lower basin reservoirs. 1. Impound and use temporary storage in F.E. Walter\nand Prompton, if available. 2. Nockamixon from elev. 395 to elev. 385\n(68.7%/4.1 bg)** and release from Lake Hopatcong to elev. 919 (1.9 bg) at a\nmaximum release rate of 75 cfs. 3. Make releases from Beltzville, Blue Marsh****\nand Nockamixon, to elev. 537,261 and 325.5 respectively, at maximum total\nrelease rate of 200 cfs, and release from Lake Hopatcong***** to elev. 915.2\n(2.4 bg) at a maximum release rate of 75 cfs. (d) Alternative\n4. Indications\n\nOperations\n\nThis alternative calls upon the upper\nbasin power company reservoirs for assistance. This alternative would be\nindicated when the New York City Delaware River Basin reservoirs are less than\n30 bg above the \"drought warning\" line and the lower basin triggers before\n\nNovember 1, thereby increasing the probable need for additional water, in this\ncase, the basin would have a high probability of entering a \"drought warning\"\ncondition, thus the City storage should be conserved. 1. Impound and use temporary storage in F.E. Walter\nand Prompton, if available. 2. Nockamixon from elev. 395 to elev. 385\n(68.7%/4.1 bg)**. 3. Make releases for Trenton from Lake\n\nWallenpaupack subject to the elevation schedule, and make proportional releases\nfrom the Mongaup Power Reservoir System***** subject to minimum operating\nlevels. 4. Make total of 5 bg release from Beltzville, Blue\n\nMarsh**** and Nockamixon, at maximum total release rate of 200 cfs, and release\nfrom Lake Hopatcong**** to elev. 919 (1.9 bg) at a maximum release rate of 75\ncfs. 5. Make releases for Trenton from Lake\n\nWallenpaupack subject to the elevation schedule, and made proportional releases\nfrom the Mongaup Power Reservoir System***** subject to minimum operating\nlevels. 6. Make releases from Beltzville, Blue Marsh****\nand Nockamixon, to elev. 537, 261 and 325.5 respectively, at maximum total\nrelease rate of 200 efs, and release from Lake Hopatcong***** to elev. 915.2\n(2.4 bg) at a maximum release rate of 75 cfs. (e) Alternative\n5. Indications\n\nOperations\n\nThis option proposes the early use of\nupper basin power company reservoirs followed much later by the use of New York\n\nCity storage. If a lower basin \"drought\" triggered early in the year\n(\ni.e., before September 1) and City storage were only 30 to 65\nbg above \"drought warning\" then there would be a distinct risk of the basin\nentering \"drought warning\" later and a strong chance that the lower basin\nreservoirs could be exhausted. This option, using upper basin power company\nstorage to conserve lower basin and New York City storage for later use, addresses these possibilities. 1. Impound and use temporary storage in F.E. Walter\nand Prompton, if available. 2. Nockamixon from elev. 395 to elev. 385\n(68.7%/4.1 bg)**. 3. Make releases for Trenton from Lake\n\nWallenpaupack subject to the elevation schedule, and make proportional releases\nfrom the Mongaup Power Reservoir System***** subject to minimum operating\nlevels. 4. Make releases from Beltzville, Blue Marsh****\nand Nockamixon, at maximum total release rate of 200 cfs, and release from Lake\n\nHopatcong***** to elev. 919 (1.9 bg) at a maximum release rate of 75 cfs. 5. Make releases for Trenton from Lake\n\nWallenpaupack subject to the elevation schedule, and make proportional releases\nfrom the Mongaup Power Reservoir System***** subject to minimum operating\nlevels. 6. Make total of 5 bg release from Beltzville, Blue\n\nMarsh**** and Nockamixon, at maximum total release rate of 200 cfs. 7. Make additional releases from New York City\n\nDelaware Reservoirs*** to augment Delaware River flow. 8. Make releases from Beltzville, Blue Marsh****\nand Nockamixon to elev. 537, 261 and 325.5 respectively, at maximum total\nrelease rate of 200 cfs, and release from Lake Hopatcong***** to elev. 915.2\n(2.4 bg) at a maximum release rate of 75 cfs. (f) Alternative\n6. Indications\n\nOperations\n\nThis option is similar to Alternative\n2 except that New York City releases would be made concurrently with releases\nfrom lower basin storage on a 50-50 basis. The conditions under which it would\nbe most appropriate would be similar to those for Alternative 2. 1. Impound and use temporary storage in F.E. Walter\nand Prompton, if available. 2. Nockamixon from elev. 395 to elev. 385\n(68.7%/4.1 bg)**. Make additional releases from New York City Delaware\n\nReservoirs*** to augment Delaware River flow, equal to and simultaneous with\nreleases from Nockamixon; to the extent New York City storage is unavailable, make releases for Trenton from Lake Wallenpaupack subject to the elevation\nschedule, and make proportional releases from the Mongaup Power Reservoir\n\nSystem***** subject to minimum operating levels. 3. Make releases from Beltzville, Blue Marsh****\nand Nockamixon to elev. 537, 261 and 325.5 respectively, at maximum total\nrelease rate of 200 cfs, and release from Lake Hopatcong to elev. 915.2 at a\nmaximum release rate of 75 cfs. Make additional releases from New York City\n\nDelaware Reservoirs*** to augment Delaware River flow, equal to and\nsimultaneous with releases from Beltzville, Blue Marsh, Nockamixon and\n\nHopatcong; to the extent New York City storage is unavailable. Make releases\nfor Trenton from Lake Wallenpaupack subject to the elevation schedule, and make\nproportional releases from the Mongaup Power Reservoir System***** subject to\nminimum operating levels. (4)\n\nReduction of conservation releases. In order to conserve storage, conservation releases from\nthe listed lower basin reservoirs shall continue to be modified in accordance\nwith Table 4 of section\n890.11\nof this Part for the\nduration of a lower basin \"drought\" condition. (5)\n\nConservation measures. Upon the declaration of a lower basin \"drought\"\nemergency, the lower basin states shall adopt and implement within the basin\ndrainage area below Montague comparable mandatory conservation measure, including restrictions on non-essential water uses, and shall implement other\nprovisions of \"drought\" contingency plans designed to achieve a target of 15\npercent reduction in depletive water use. The following water uses shall be\ndeemed non-essential: (i) Serving of\nwater to any patron of a restaurant, club or other eating place unless\nspecifically requested by such patron. (ii)\n\nThe use of water for ornamental\npurposes. (iii)\n\nThe use of water\nfor washing paved surfaces such as streets, sidewalks, outdoor plazas, driveways, garages, parking areas and patios. (iv)\n\nThe use of water for non-commercial\nwashing or cleaning of vehicles except for the windshields and windows and\nexcept for emergency vehicles. (v) The use of water for watering of established laws (\ni.e., those\nnot newly seeded, sodded or fertilized). (vi)\n\nThe use of water for watering or\nsprinkling any part of a golf course except for tees, greens, and\naprons. (vii)\n\nThe use of water for\nwatering non-commercial outdoor gardens, landscaped areas, trees, shrube and\nother outdoor plants except: water may be applied with a bucket, can or\nhand-held hose equipped with automatic shut-off valve. (6)\n\nEnding \"drought\". When the storage levels in Beltzville and Blue Marsh\n\nReservoirs simultaneously exceed their respective lower basin \"drought\" storage\nlevels for 30 consecutive days or either one of those reservoirs spills, the\nlower basin \"drought\" operation shall automatically terminate and either lower\nbasin \"drought warning\" or normal operations shall be resumed in accordance\nwith subdivision (b) or (c), unless the decree parties unanimously agree\notherwise. (f) Operations during basinwide drought warning or drought following lower\nbasin drought warning or drought. (1)\n\nSelection of alternate plans. If, following the triggering of a lower basin \"drought\"\nor lower basin \"drought warning\" under this plan, the combined storage in the\n\nNew York City Delaware River Basin Reservoirs declines to basinwide \"drought\nwarning\" or \"drought\" conditions as defined in section\n890.9\nof this Part, the parties to\nthe 1954 Decree shall select and agree to, and the Delaware River Basin\n\nCommission shall implement, the provisions of either paragraph (f)(2) or (f)(3)\nof this Plan. In the absence of unanimous agreement, the operating rules set\nforth in section\n890.9\nof this Part shall govern. The parties may be unanimous agreement modify and adjust either plan as\nnecessary and appropriate to respond to actual conditions. In selecting between\nthe alternative plans, and any modification thereto, the parties will consider\nthe following factors: (i) The extent\nand severity of drought conditions in various parts of the basin. (ii)\n\nThe season, and seasonal variation of\nhydrologic conditions. (iii)\n\nThe\nstatus of storage in all affected reservoirs, and the probability of refill or\ndrawdown for each reservoir. (iv)\n\nThe status of demands upon each reservoir. (v) The lead time needed to effect\nconservation measures and to reduce demand. (vi)\n\nThe prior availability of time and\nnotice to provide for adequate warning and preparation for drought response\nactions. (vii)\n\nThe need and ability\nto take expedited steps to conserve storage in the New York City and other\nbasin reservoirs. (2)\n\nCombined drought operations plan 1. (i) The\nschedules of phased reductions governing the maximum allowable rates of\ndiversion of waters of the Delaware River Basin by New York City, the minimum\ncompensating releases to be made by the City of New York Delaware River Basin\n\nReservoirs, and the streamflow objectives at the U.S.G.S. gaging station\nlocated at Montague, NJ, shall be as prescribed in section\n890.9\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nThe operation of Lake Wallenpaupack and\nthe Mongaup System Reservoirs shall be governed by the storage and release\nschedules prescribed in the operating plan for basinwide \"drought\" conditions. The commission may delegate to the River Master responsibility for directing\noperation of the Lake Wallenpaupack and Mongaup facilities under the release\nschedules and drought management policies of the commission. (iii)\n\nSo long as lower basin \"drought\nwarning\" or lower basin \"drought\" conditions prevail simultaneously with\nbasinwide \"drought warning\" and \"drought\" conditions, the maximum allowable\nrates of diversion of Delaware Basin waters by New Jersey, the streamflow\nobjectives at the U.S.G.S. gaging station located at Trenton, NJ, and the\noperation of storage in Beltzville Reservoir, Blue Marsh Reservoir, Lake\n\nNockamixon, Lake Hopatcong, and any storage made available in the F.E. Walter\nand Prompton Reservoirs shall be governed by the stricter of the provisions of\nsubdivisions (c) and (d) of the Lower Delaware River Basin Operating Plan, or\nthe provisions of section\n890.9\nof this Part, which permit\nlesser New Jersey diversions and lower Trenton flow objectives. (3)\n\nCombined drought operations\nplan 2. (i) If during the period May 1 to\n\nNovember 30, the combined storage in the New York City Delaware River Basin\n\nReservoirs is in the upper half of the \"drought warning\" condition identified\nin Figure 1 of section\n890.9\nof this Part, the maximum\nallowable rates of diversion of waters of the Delaware by New York City, the\nminimum compensating releases to be made by the New York City Delaware River\n\nBasin Reservoirs, and the streamflow objectives at the U.S.G.S. gaging station\nlocated at Montague, NJ, shall be as prescribed for lower half \"drought\nwarning\" in Tables 1 and 2 of section\n890.9\nof this Part. If the\ncombined storage in the New York City Delaware River Basin reservoirs\nsubsequently enters the lower half of the \"drought warning\" condition\nidentified in Figure 1 of section\n890.9\nof this Part, the maximum\nallowable rate of diversions of the Delaware Basin by New York City, the\nminimum compensating releases to be made by the New York City Delaware River\n\nBasin reservoirs, and the streamflow objectives at the U.S.G.S. gaging station\nlocated at Montague, NJ, shall be as prescribed for \"drought\" in Tables 1 and 2\nof section\n890.9\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nIf during the period December 1 to April\n30, the combined storage in the New York City Delaware River Basin Reservoirs\nfalls within the \"drought warning\" levels identified in Figure 1 of section\n890.9\nof this Part, the maximum\nrates of New York City diversions, the minimum compensating releases made by\nthe New York City Delaware River Basin Reservoirs, and the Montague streamflow\nobjectives shall be as prescribed for the applicable \"drought warning\" upper\nand lower half conditions set forth in Tables 1 and 2 of section\n890.9\nof this Part. Any subsequent\ntriggering of basinwide \"drought\" conditions shall be governed by Figure 1 of\nsection\n890.9\nof this Part. (iii)\n\nSo long as lower basin \"drought\nwarning\" or lower basin \"drought\" conditions prevail simultaneous with a\nbasinwide \"drought warning\" condition, the maximum rate of diversion by New\n\nJersey, the minimum streamflow objectives at Trenton, and the operation of\navailable storage in Beltzville Reservoir, Blue Marsh Reservoir, Lake\n\nNockamixon, Lake Hopatcong, and the F.E. Walter and Prompton Reservoirs shall\nbe governed by the provisions of subdivisions (c) and (d) of the Lower Delaware\n\nRiver Basin Drought Operating Plan. (iv)\n\nIn the event that following the\ntriggering of a lower basin \"drought warning\" or lower basin \"drought,\" the\ncombined storage in the New York City Delaware River Basin Reservoirs is in the\n\"drought\" levels identified in subparagraphs (f)(3)(i) and (ii) of this\nsection, whichever is applicable, the maximum rate of diversions by New York\n\nCity and New Jersey, the minimum rates of compensating releases, and the\nminumum streamflow objectives at Montague, NJ and Trenton, NJ shall be those\nset forth in Tables 1 and 2 of section\n890.9\nof this Part. The operation\nof all basin reservoirs shall be as prescribed in the plans for basinwide\ndrought reservoir operation. (v) The operation of Lake Wallenpaupack and the Mongaup System Reservoirs shall be\ngoverned by the storage and release schedules prescribed in the operating plan\nfor basinwide \"drought\" conditions. The commission may delegate to the River\n\nMaster responsibility for directing operation of the Lake Wallenpaupack and\n\nMongaup facilities under the release schedules and drought management policies\nof the commission.
