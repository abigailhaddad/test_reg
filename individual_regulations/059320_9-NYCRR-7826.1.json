  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7826.1 - Energy efficiency standards for residential and commercial water heaters\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. (1)\n\nWater heater means an\nautomatically controlled vessel designed primarily for heating water or heating\nand storing water to provide hot water service for domestic or sanitary\npurposes. (2)\n\nRecovery efficiency\nor thermal efficiency means the ratio of the heat absorbed by the water to the\nheat input delivered to the heating unit during the period that the water\ntemperature is raised from the initial temperature to the final water\ntemperature. (3)\n\nStandby loss means\nthe heat loss occurring while maintaining the final water temperature, over\nperiods when no hot water is being drawn from the water tank. (4)\n\nEnergy factor means the overall\nefficiency of a water heater based on its recovery efficiency, standby loss and\nany auxiliary power input. (5)\n\nSmoke spot number means the number corresponding to the spot on the Bacharach\nsmoke scale, or other equivalent smoke scale, most closely matching the shade\nof a test spot, which is obtained by pulling a fixed volume of flue gas through\na fixed area of standard filter paper. (6)\n\nStored thermal energy means the amount of\nenergy measured in Btu stored in the water heater, calculated as the product of\nthe manufacturer's specified storage capacity, the temperature difference\nbetween the initial and final water temperatures and the specific heat of\nwater. (7)\n\nTesting standard or TS\nmeans the testing standard referenced in Part 7816 of this Title to be used for\ndetermining compliance with this section. (b) Standards and testing requirements. (1)\n\nElectric storage water heaters subject to\n\nUnited States Department of Energy appliance efficiency test procedures shall\nhave an energy factor no less than.93 -.0013V, where V equals the\nmanufacturer's specified storage capacity in gallons, when calculated and\ntested in accordance with the procedures specified in TS-4a. (2)\n\nAll other electric storage water heaters\nshall have a standby loss not in excess of four watts per square foot of the\nnet surface area of the water heater when tested in accordance with TS-4a. The\nnet surface area of the water heater is equal to the sum of twice the mean\ncross-sectional area and the product of the length of the mean cross-section\nand the mean perimeter of the water heater, discounting any area which deviates\nfrom a regular geometric figure. (3)\n\nGas-fired water heaters subject to United\n\nStates Department of Energy appliance efficiency test procedures shall have an\nenergy factor no less than.6 -.0019V, where V equals the manufacturer's\nspecified storage capacity in gallons, when calculated and tested in accordance\nwith the procedures specified in TS-4a. (4)\n\nOil-fired water heaters subject to United\n\nStates Department of Energy appliance efficiency test procedures shall have an\nenergy factor no less than.59 -.0019V, where V equals the manufacturer's\nspecified storage capacity in gallons, when calculated and tested in accordance\nwith the procedures specified in TS-4a. (5)\n\nAll other gas-fired and oil-fired storage\nand nonstorage water heaters shall have a minimum thermal efficiency of 75\npercent, when tested in accordance with TS-4b. In addition, all other gas-fired\nand oil-fired storage water heaters shall have a standby loss not in excess of\na percent of the stored thermal energy equal to 2.3 plus the quotient of 67\ndivided by the manufacturer's specified storage capacity in gallons, when\ntested in accordance with TS-4b. With respect to oil-fired water heaters, testing shall assume a higher heating value of at least 138,500 Btu per gallon, the draft settings shall be in accordance with the manufacturer's\nspecifications, and the smoke level in the flue shall not exceed a smoke spot\nnumber of one. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n7826.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
