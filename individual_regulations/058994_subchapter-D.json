Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, ch. I, subch. D\nParts 35 through 39 contained in this Subchapter were\nrenumbered as part of a reorganization of the department's regulations. These\n\nParts were previously Parts 46 through 50. The rule making which renumbered\nthese Parts did not make substantive changes and did not seek to incorporate\nintervening changes in the law. The regulations should be read in conjunction\nwith current law. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
