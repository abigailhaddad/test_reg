Tit. 1 § 224.15 - Stayed or invalid sections\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf any section of this Part is stayed or held invalid, the\nremainder will stay in force. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n224.15\n\nAmended\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 20, 2019/Volume XLI, Issue 47, eff. 11/20/2019\n\nRenumbered from 224.17\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register April 23, 2025/Volume XLVII, Issue 16, eff. 4/23/2025\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. (a) Custom blending device\nshall mean any gasoline dispensing device that delivers a mixture of two gasoline products of different octane ratings. (b) Any blended fuel dispensed in the inspection and test of a custom blending device shall be returned to the lowest octane storage tank supplying that custom blending device. (c) Custom blending devices where the blending occurs after the measurement of the products shall be inspected and tested for accuracy according to the procedures set forth below. (1)\n\nAllow 10-second drain period each time test measure is emptied. To determine proper operation of totalizers, observe and record the totalizer indications before and after all test drafts. (2)\n\nTest at lowest octane. Set selector control so that lowest octane product is dispensed. Normal test - full flow - basic tolerance. If the first test is well within tolerance, proceed to paragraph (3) of this subdivision; otherwise repeat this test. (3)\n\nCheck computed price on both sides of dispenser. (4)\n\nTest at highest octane. Set selector control so that highest octane product is dispensed. Normal test - full flow - basic tolerance. If test is well within tolerance, proceed to paragraph (5) of this subdivision; otherwise repeat this test. (5)\n\nCheck computed price on both sides of dispenser. (6)\n\nTest at blend - select an intermediate blend. Special test -slow flow - basic tolerance. If test is well within tolerance and the error is less than or equals the average error of the previous two tests, proceed to paragraph (7) of this subdivision; otherwise slow flow test at first grade above lowest octane and first grade beneath highest octane (where applicable). (7)\n\nCheck computed price on both sides of dispenser. (8)\n\nSet money-value computation on other blends. Set selector control at each of the remaining blends and dispense one indicated gallon to check computed price. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
