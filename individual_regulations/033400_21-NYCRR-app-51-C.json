At the time of giving conditional approval to a\nproject, the issuer may authorize the applicant to undertake technical, engineering, economic, planning, environmental, feasibility or research\nstudies, reports or memoranda which are preliminary to and may support the\nformulation of proposals for the action provided no such preliminary approval\nshall require the issuer to make any final decision with respect to such action\nunless and until the requirements of this Part have been fulfilled.

Reconditioning of existing facilities and structures, including\nessentially maintenance-type work with improvements to correct substandard\nfeatures. Minor reconstruction of existing facilities and structures\nwithout making major expansion of said facilities or structures. These projects\nshall qualify as Type II only if the project requires: Less than a 50 percent expansion of said facilities, and\n\nNo physical effect on unusual or unique areas, including\n\nFederal or State registered historic sites and critical areas designated in 6\nNYCRR\n617.12\n\nType I(a) (22) and (23).

The conduct, preparation or review of technical, engineering, economic, planning, environmental, feasibility or research studies, reports or\nmemoranda which are preliminary to and may support the formulation of\nproposal(s) for action(s) which do not otherwise commit the issuer to commence\nor engage in such action.
