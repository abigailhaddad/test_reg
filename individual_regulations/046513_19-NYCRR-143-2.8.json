  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 §§ 143-2.8 - Ministerial nature of filing office duties and responsibilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The duties and\nresponsibilities of the filing offices with respect to the administration of\nthe UCC are ministerial. In accepting a document for filing (or in refusing to\nfile a document), a filing office makes no determination, and creates no\npresumption, with respect to any of the following: (1)\nwhether such document is (or is not)\nlegally sufficient; (2)\nwhether the\ninformation in such document is (or is not) correct; (3)\nwhether the name of any person is (or is\nnot) sufficiently provided in such document; (4)\nwhether the collateral is (or is not)\nproperly or sufficiently described in such document; (5)\nwhether any person, collateral, obligation, security interest, lease, consignment, bailment, sale, agricultural\nlien, or other transaction, lien or interest of any kind does (or does not)\nexist; (6)\nwhether any person does\n(or does not) have title to, possession of, or any other rights in, any\ncollateral or other property of any kind; (7)\nwhether such filing office is (or is not)\na proper office for the filing of such document; or\n(8)\nwhether some other or additional filing\nor act is (or is not) necessary to perfect, continue, terminate, assign, amend, give notice of, or otherwise affect any security interest, lease, consignment, bailment, sale, agricultural lien, or other lien or interest of any\nkind. (b) The name of a\ndebtor or secured party or other party will be entered in the UCC information\nmanagement system exactly as such name appears on the record to be filed\n(provided, however, that any filing office may, at its option, enter and store\nnames and other information in the UCC information management system in all\nuppercase, without regard to the case[s] used in the UCC document as submitted\nfor filing). The filing office assumes no responsibility for the correct\nspelling of a name, and will enter the data in accordance with the filer's\nspelling (provided, however, that any filing office may, at its option, enter\nand store names and other information in the UCC information management system\nin all uppercase, without regard to the case[s] used in the UCC document as\nsubmitted for filing). The filing office assumes no responsibility for\ndetermining whether the debtor's name complies with the requirements of section\n9-503 of the UCC. (c) Nothing in\nthis section prevents a filing office from communicating to a filer or a\nremitter that the filing office noticed an apparent or potential defect or\nerror in a document submitted for filing. However, a filing office is not\nrequired to search for any such defect or error, and a filing office is not\nrequired to notify any filer, remitter, or other person of any such defect or\nerror, or otherwise to call any such defect or error to the attention of any\nfiler, remitter, or other person. The responsibility for the legal\neffectiveness of a filing rests with the filer and remitter. Filing offices\nbear no responsibility for such effectiveness. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
