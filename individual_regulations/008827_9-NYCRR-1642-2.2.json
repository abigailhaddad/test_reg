  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-2.2 - Commitments\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll commitments of a local agency shall be of record. The power to make commitments resides in the governing body of the local\nagency. The local agency may, however, through its governing body, delegate\nauthority to make commitments to a designated person or persons. Such\ndelegation of authority shall be recorded in the minutes of the local agency\nand shall spell out clearly the person or persons designated and the extent of\nthe authority delegated. The bulk of the local agency's commitments will be in\nthe form of contracts and purchase orders. These shall be of record prior to\nthe date of service or the delivery of materials. Other commitments will take\nthe form of approved travel vouchers, payrolls, authorized rent and security\ndeposit refunds, etc. Certain commitments, such as contracts for the purchase\nof land and for the construction of the project, etc., require the prior\napproval of the division before being entered into. While all commitments shall\nbe of record, the point at which the commitment is reflected in the accounts\nwill depend on the nature of the commitment. Thus, commitments for development\ncontracts and changes therein will be fully reflected in the accounts, as they\nare entered into, as described in Part 1646, Development Period Accounting. Other commitments, such as purchase orders and travel vouchers, will be\nreflected in the accounts only as they are vouchered for payment, as described\nin section\n1642-2.4, etc. However, commitments\nfor services rendered or materials delivered as of the end of a fiscal year, which have not yet been vouchered for payment, should be reflected as accrued\nliabilities at the end of the fiscal year. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-2.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
