  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 980.9 - Responsibilities of current transportation providers in grant counties\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Regardless of\ntheir degree of participation in their county's coordinated service program, all public and private human service agencies or entities that apply for or\nhave received federal, state or local government aid that is or may be used, in\nwhole or in part, to provide and/or contract for passenger transportation\nservices, or agencies that otherwise provide, purchase or operate\ntransportation services, shall forward to their county's Services Coordinator\nthe following information: (1)\nthe annual\namounts and sources of federal, state or local financial aid they received that\nhave actually been used for passenger transportation in the two most recent\ncomplete program fiscal years; (2)\nthe annual costs of passenger transportation provided under their jurisdiction\nfor the two most recent complete program fiscal years; such costs shall be on a\nfully allocated basis and shall include appropriate pro-rated costs for agency\nactivities which encompass several functions; (3)\ncopies of their most recent request(s)\nfor federal, state or local aid that included a transportation component and\ntheir most recent approved request for same; and copies of the most recent\naudit or financial statement, if any, of their programs that included\ntransportation services; (4)\nany\ndata or other information requested by the county's Services Coordinator\nregarding the agency's transportation services, facilities, equipment, staffing\nor usage, and operation budgets, as may be necessary for the preparation, implementation or updating of the county's coordinated public transportation\nservice plan. In cases where any such data is not readily available, agencies\nshall make all records, files and other agency information, as is necessary to\ncomplete or calculate such data, available to their County's Services\n\nCoordinator for this purpose. (b) Current operators of passenger\ntransportation utilizing federal or state funds are encouraged to lease their\nvehicles to the CSO for use in the coordinated service. In some cases, county\ngovernments or appropriate State agencies may require this. Current providers\nof client-oriented transportation that join in the coordinated service are\nexpected to phase-out regular passenger transportation operating\nresponsibilities so that the productivity of the coordinated service will be\nmaximized. Current providers would purchase transportation service from the CSO\nfor their clients through tickets, monthly passes or other appropriate\nmechanisms. (c) Agencies which are\ncurrent purchasers of transportation receiving federal or state funds by or\nthrough the County, are expected to give preference to the CSO in purchasing\ntransportation service and client referral. (d) Current operators of vehicles purchased\nthrough the Section 16(b)(2) Program administered by the Department are\nencouraged to join the county's coordinated service by leasing their current\nvehicles to the CSO; if so they would then purchase service for their clients\nfrom the CSO. Future grants of 16(b)(2) vehicles to private, non-profit\norganizations in the rural county would be contingent upon such vehicles' full\ntime management and control by the CSO. (e) School districts are encouraged to\nparticipate in their county's coordinated service program as authorized in\n\nSection 1502 of the State Education Law. Section 1502 authorizes school\ndistricts to contract to store, maintain and repair any motor vehicle of and\nprovide driver training for any operator of any motor vehicle used to provide a\nportion of a county's coordinated public transportation service and owned by\nany municipal corporation or any not-for-profit organization. The board of\neducation of any school district is also authorized to contract with an\noperator of a coordinated public transportation service for the purpose of\nproviding a portion of that service.
