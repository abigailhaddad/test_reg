  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-1.4 - Fixed dollar minimum tax\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Generally, the fixed dollar minimum is the measure of the tax if such\ncalculation results in an amount of tax that is greater than or equal to the\nbusiness income base tax and greater than or equal to the capital base tax. The\namount of the fixed dollar minimum tax determined in section 210(1)(d) varies\nby the amount of New York receipts and the type of taxpayer. (b) (1)\n\nWhere a group of corporations files a combined report, the fixed dollar minimum\ntax attributable to the designated agent generally is the measure of the tax\nfor the combined group if such calculation results in an amount of tax greater\nthan or equal to the combined business income base tax and greater than or\nequal to the combined capital base tax. In addition, the tax on a combined\nreport must include the fixed dollar minimum tax for each member of the\ncombined group that is a taxpayer, other than the designated agent. Any\ncorporation included in the combined report that is not a taxpayer is not\nrequired to pay a fixed dollar minimum tax. (2)\n\nEach taxpayer member of the combined\ngroup, including the designated agent, must compute its own fixed dollar\nminimum tax based on its own New York receipts. Such receipts must be computed\non a separate company basis and determined without the consideration of\nintercorporate eliminations or deferrals. (c) For purposes of calculating the fixed\ndollar minimum tax, New York receipts are the receipts included in the\nnumerator of the apportionment factor for the taxable year. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n3-1.4\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
