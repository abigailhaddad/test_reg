  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 935.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In Table I an item number is assigned consecutively to each\nspecifically designated waters or portion thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in Table I shall mean that number or abbreviation assigned to any\ndesignated waters or portion thereof for the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering or index system used to\nidentify specific waters of New York State was adapted from that used by the\n\nNew York State Conservation Department in its biological survey series of\nreports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a drainage area, such\nas a river, large lake, bay or sound, is usually referred to by name or an\nabbreviation. Tributaries of primary river waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Tributaries of primary lake, bay or sound\nwaters are consecutively numbered in a clockwise order from a defined point, usually the outlet of the primary waters. Subtributaries are numbered as\nencountered along the tributary proceeding from its mouth to the source, and in\nlike manner all of its other stream courses are so numbered. Ponds and lakes\nare numbered in the order they are encountered within the system. Tributaries\nof such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing\nclockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. The numbers\nassigned to such lakes and ponds are prefixed by the letter P. When isolated\nlakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for\nconvenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any waters to\nwhich no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the waters\nunder consideration by the New York State Conservation Department in its\n\nBiological Survey of the Lower Hudson Watershed\nand\n\nBiological Survey of the Fresh Waters of Long Island\nin 1936\nand 1938, respectively, and has been closely followed in connection with the\nnumerical identification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on the older maps employed by the Conservation Department at\nthe time of its 1936 and 1938 surveys but not shown on later editions of maps\nreproduced herein. Conversely, streams, lakes and ponds not shown on the older\nmaps but appearing on the newer maps are designated by suffix letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to\nthe identification of the designated waters may be outlined as follows: Streams\ndraining Long Island proper are identified by waters index numbers prefixed by\nthe abbreviation \"LI.\" Streams draining the mainland and entering Long Island\n\nSound are identified by waters index numbers prefixed by the abbreviation\n\"LIS\". Waters of the East River are identified by waters index numbers prefixed\nby \"ER\". (4)\n\nThe following table\nwill illustrate how the designated waters may be identified through use of the\nwaters index system: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\nER\nEast River\n\nPrimary waters. ER 3\n\nBronx River\n\nThe third tributary entering East River above the\nmouth. ER 3-22\n\nGrassy Sprain Brook\n\nThe 22nd tributary entering the Bronx River. ER 3-22-4-P 1055\n\nGrassy Sprain Reservoir (located on the fourth\ntributary of Grassy Sprain Brook)\n\nThe 1,055th pond or lake encountered in the\nbiological survey area of the Lower Hudson River watershed. ER (10.1)\n\nEast River\nA point on the East River ten and one-tenth miles\nabove the mouth. LIS 8\n\nMamaroneck River\n\nThe eighth tributary entering Long Island Sound\nencountered in a clockwise direction from Throgs Point. LI 12\n\nFlushing Creek\n\nThe 12th stream encountered on Long Island\nproceeding in a clockwise direction around the island from Fort Hamilton. (5)\n\nThere are instances where a parenthetical\ndecimal number appears following the name. Such number appearing within the\nparentheses indicates the distance in miles above the mouth to a point on the\nidentified watercourse. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs., indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries, respectively, shall mean any\nstream, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other stream, pond or other body of surface water; where no tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated\nwaters shall include only the stream, pond or other body of water referenced by\nsuch waters index number; where a tributary, tributaries, subtributary or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, pond or other body of water\nreferenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and subtributaries\nthereof, which are shown on the reference maps, excluding numbered ponds, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\n\nTable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\nknown and which may appear on the reference maps. In cases of specifically\ndesignated waters which have no name, the named waters to which the unnamed\nwaters are tributary are identified as far as possible. (e) Description. The column headed\n\"Description\" contains designations of segments or sections of waters under\nconsideration to which a particular assignment of a class and standards shall\napply. Also included in this column is any useful information pertinent to the\nclassification or standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as appearing in Table I, means map reference\nnumber and indicates one or more of the following numbered maps reproduced\nherein completely or in part, on which maps the specifically designated waters\nand their index numbers are shown within the topographical limit line of the\ndescribed drainage basins or areas. An index for map numbers is shown on Map 2, section\n935.8, infra.
