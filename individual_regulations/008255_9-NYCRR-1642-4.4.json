  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-4.4 - Daily statement of operations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose of recording a summary of\nall transactions with tenants, a daily statement of operations shall be\nprepared. A specimen form of daily statement of operations is shown as Exhibits\n23 and 24 of Appendix S-8. At the close of each day, the accumulated total of\neach type of transaction, both for charges and credits, shall be recorded on\nthe appropriate line of the daily statement of operations. The daily statement\nof operations shall contain a line for each charge and credit heading used in\nthe tenants charge and credit book (Exhibit 25, Appendix S-8). Charges and\ncredits to tenants' accounts receivable shall be separated from charges and\ncredits to security deposits. (b) A\nlisting of miscellaneous charge and credit tickets shall be made daily and\nsummarized on the reverse side of the daily statement of operations. Where\nadjustments (supported by miscellaneous charge and credit tickets) have been\nmade for errors in posting or for cancellation of rents and other charges\npreviously made to tenants' accounts, the amounts of the adjustments shall be\nentered in the correction and adjustments columns, as either an addition or\ndeduction of the item. The amount entered in the net total column shall be the\namount entered in the total column plus or minus the adjustments recorded in\nthe correction column. (c) Alternative procedures for reflecting the scheduled charges to tenants for\nbasic rent and surcharges on the daily statement of operations for the first\nday of the month are possible. A recommended procedure is to enter the gross\nrent roll control figures (taken from the rent roll and vacancy loss control\nbook) for the basic rent schedule and surcharges on the first line of the\ncharges section, on the reverse side of the daily statement of operations, making the notation \"rent roll control\" in the ticket number column. The\nvacancy loss control figure of the first day of the month (taken from the rent\nroll and vacancy loss control book) is similarly entered on the first line of\nthe credits section, making the notation \"vacancy loss\" in the ticket number\ncolumn. Miscellaneous charge and credit tickets dated the first day of the\nmonth are then listed and analyzed in the manner previously described and the\ntotals at the end of the day transcribed to the front of the form. It is\nevident that, under this procedure, the net totals (column 5, Exhibit 23 of\n\nAppendix S-8) carried forward to the tenants charge and credit book will\nautomatically reflect the controlled scheduled authorized rent charges made to\ntenants on the first day of the month. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-4.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
