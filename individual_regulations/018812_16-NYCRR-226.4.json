Each utility shall have meter testing facilities that are\nadequately maintained, are provided with suitable equipment and kept in proper\ncondition for testing gas meters and auxiliary devices, and include at least\none bell prover with a capacity not under five cubic feet. (b) Notification. Each utility shall keep the\ndepartment staff informed of the location of each test facility where its\nmeters and accessories are tested, any change in the facility which may affect\nthe accuracy of its testing, and the number, type, and the most recent\ncertification date of each test-standard at that location. (c) Temperature. Each meter test location\nshall be maintained to minimize temperature fluctuations and assure temperature\nequilibrium between the room air, the testing equipment including the\nprover(s), the sealing medium in each bell prover and the air or other testing\nmedium supplied to each bell prover and the meters under test. Any temperature\nvariation shall be limited to 1° F or less between the items listed\nabove. (d) Temperature test\nconditions for testing temperature compensating gas meters: (1)\n\nAmbient temperature. The ambient\ntemperature test condition is the existing temperature that the gas meter is\nexposed to at the time of a meter test. With utility shop testing, the ambient\ntemperature is the normal proving room temperature. (2)\n\nAverage winter temperature. The average\nwinter temperature test is an approved gas meter test condition that represents\nthe average temperature environment that an outdoor gas meter is expected to be\nexposed to during the winter. This temperature is specified as 20° F for\nall utilities. (3)\n\nExtreme\ntemperature. The extreme temperature test condition for winter and summer are\nspecified gas meter test conditions of 0° F and 100° F, respectively. (e) Tests\nand inspections. All meter testing facilities shall be available for\ninspection, certification and reasonable use by the department staff. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
