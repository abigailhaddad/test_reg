(iv)\n\nShould the third-party testing conclude\nthat the water supplied by an existing, active water supply well met federal\n(see section 1100-15.1(j)(1)(i) of this Part) and state standards for potable\nwater (see 10 NYCRR Part\n75, Appendix 75-c) prior to construction, but failed\nto meet such standards post construction as a result of facility activities, the permittee shall cause a new water well to be constructed, in consultation\nwith the property owner, at least one hundred (100) feet from collection lines\nand access roads, and at least two hundred (200) feet from all other facility\ncomponents. The results of such tests and reports shall be made available to\nthe relevant municipalities upon request. (o) Threatened and Endangered\n\nSpecies. (1)\n\nFor facilities that\nwould impact NYS threatened or endangered species other than NYS threatened or\nendangered grassland birds or their habitat, the permittee shall implement an\napproved Net Conservation Benefit Plan (NCBP) that shall include the following: (i) A demonstration that the NCBP results in\na positive benefit on each of the affected species; (ii)\n\nDetailed explanation of the net\nconservation benefit to the species based on the actual location and type of\nminimization measures to be taken for each of the affected species; (iii)\n\nFull source information supporting a\ndetermination as to the net conservation benefit for each of the affected\nspecies; (iv)\nA consideration of\npotential minimization and mitigation measures for each of the affected\nspecies; (v) A consideration of\npotential sites for mitigation measures for each of the affected\nspecies; (vi)\n\nThe identification\nand detailed description of the mitigation actions that will be undertaken by\nthe permittee to achieve a net conservation benefit to the affected species, including, if applicable, payment of a required mitigation fee into the\n\nEndangered and Threatened Species Mitigation Fund established pursuant to\nsection 99(hh) of the New York State Finance Law; and\n(vii)\n\nTo the extent that physical mitigation\nwill be performed, a letter or other indication of the permittee's financial\nand technical capability and commitment to fund and execute such management, maintenance and monitoring for the life of the facility/term of the siting\npermit. (2)\n\nFor\nfacilities determined pursuant to the procedures set forth in section\n1100-2.13(e)(2) to have de minimis impacts to NYS threatened or endangered\ngrassland birds: (i) If an active nest is\nidentified within the facility site prior to or during construction, and the\nfacility results in adverse impacts to the nest or grasslands twenty-five (25)\nacres or more in size that were previously (during pre-application) or newly\n(prior to or during construction) determined to be occupied habitat, then the\npermittee shall coordinate with the NYSDPS and the Office to adjust the limits\nof disturbance and/or adjust the construction schedule to avoid work in the\narea until nesting has been completed or the permittee shall pay into the\n\nEndangered and Threatened Species Mitigation Bank Fund the required mitigation\nfee commensurate with the actual acreage taken. (3)\n\nFor facilities that will have more than a\nde minimis impact on NYS threatened or endangered grassland birds, the\npermittee shall implement the following as part of the NCBP: (i) The permittee shall implement\nenvironmental monitoring immediately prior to and during construction in the\noccupied habitat to search for NYS threatened or endangered species occurrence\nbased on the species' seasonal windows for presence. (ii)\n\nIf active nests of the NYS threatened or\nendangered species are found within the occupied habitat, then the permittee\nshall coordinate with the NYSDPS and the Office to adjust the limits of\ndisturbance and/or adjust the construction schedule to avoid work in the area\nuntil nesting has been completed. (iii)\n\nTo avoid direct impacts to NYS\nthreatened or endangered grassland bird species, the following work windows\napply for all ground disturbance and construction-related activities, including\nrestoration and equipment/component staging, storage, and transportation, within occupied habitat: (a) In NYS\nthreatened or endangered grassland bird occupied breeding habitat, work shall\nbe conducted only between August 16 and April 22; (b) In NYS threatened or endangered grassland\nbird occupied wintering habitat, work shall be conducted only between April 1\nand November 14; (c) In areas of\nthe facility where both breeding and wintering occupied habitat occurs, work\nshall be conducted only between August 16 and November 14, and between April 1\nand 22. (iv)\n\nIf fields\nwithin identified occupied breeding habitat are planted with row crops (e.g., corn, beans, or vegetables) in the farming season prior to the commencement of\nfacility construction and such fields were historically used for row crops\nduring at least one of the prior five (5) years, these fields will not be\nsubject to the construction timing restrictions set forth in subparagraphs\n(iii)( a) and ( c) of this paragraph. (v) If the permittee has identified\nconstruction activities that must occur between November 15 and March 31 in\nidentified NYS threatened or endangered grassland bird occupied wintering\nhabitat, or between April 23 and August 15 in identified NYS threatened or\nendangered grassland bird occupied breeding habitat outside of row crop areas\ndescribed above, the occupied habitat area(s) proposed for active construction\nshall be assessed by an on-site environmental monitor or biologist who shall\nconduct surveys for NYS threatened or endangered grassland bird species. The\nsurveys shall occur weekly until construction activities have been completed in\nthe occupied habitat area, unless otherwise agreed to by the Office. If no NYS\nthreatened or endangered grassland bird species are detected during the survey, the area shall be considered clear for seven (7) days, when another survey\nshall be performed. If NYS threatened or endangered grassland bird species are\ndetected, the permittee shall comply with subdivision (o)(7) of this\nsection. (vi)\n\nAll temporary\ndisturbance or modification of established grassland vegetation communities\nthat occurs as a result of facility construction, restoration, or maintenance\nactivities shall be restored utilizing a native herbaceous seed mix or the\npre-existing grassland vegetative conditions by re-grading and re-seeding with\nan appropriate native seed mix after disturbance activities are completed, unless returning to agricultural production or otherwise specified by the\nlandowner. These temporarily disturbed or modified areas include all areas\nwithin the facility site that do not have impervious cover, such as temporary\nroads, material and equipment staging and storage areas, and electric line\nrights of way. (vii)\n\nThe permittee\nshall implement the avoidance and minimization measures identified in section\n1100-2.13 of this Part and the other conditions herein to minimize potential\ntake of the species. (viii)\n\nTo the\nextent that the Office has determined that the facility would result in impacts\nto grassland bird occupied habitat requiring mitigation, the permittee shall\npay the required mitigation fee commensurate with the actual acreage of\noccupied habitat taken into the Endangered and Threatened Species Mitigation\n\nBank Fund with the sole purpose to conserve habitat of similar or higher\nquality or otherwise achieve a net conservation benefit to the impacted\nspecies. (ix)\n\nIf the permittee\nproposes a NCBP involving permittee-implemented grassland bird habitat\nconservation in lieu of payment of a mitigation fee pursuant to subparagraph\n(viii) of this paragraph, the required mitigation ratio shall be 0.4 acres of\nmitigation for every acre of occupied grassland bird breeding habitat\ndetermined to be taken and 0.2 acres of mitigation for every acre of occupied\ngrassland bird wintering habitat determined to be taken. These mitigation\nrequirements are based upon multiplying impacts by the ratios described above\nand dividing impacts by five lifecycles of habitat succession (e.g., a 30-year\nmitigation project term and 5-year timeframe in which unmanaged grassland would\nnaturally succeed into scrub/shrub habitat, minus one lifecycle to provide a\nnet conservation benefit). (4)\n\nFor facilities that will impact NYS\nthreatened or endangered bat species, the permittee shall implement the\nfollowing as part of the NCBP: (i) No facility\ncomponent shall be sited or located within one hundred fifty (150) feet of any\nknown northern long-eared bat maternity roost, within five hundred (500) feet\nof any known Indiana bat maternity roost, or one quarter (0.25) mile of any\nknown northern long-eared bat or Indiana bat hibernaculum. (ii)\n\nIf at any time during the life of the\nfacility, an active NYS threatened or endangered bat species maternity colony\nroost tree (or structure) is discovered within the facility site, the NYSDPS\nand the Office shall be notified within twenty-four (24) hours of discovery\n(during construction) and forty-eight (48) hours of discovery (during\noperation), and the colony site shall be marked. A five hundred (500)-foot\nradius around the colony shall be posted and avoided until notice to continue\nconstruction, ground clearing, grading, non- emergency maintenance or\nrestoration activities, as applicable, at that site is granted by the NYSDPS or\nthe Office. A re-evaluation of the potential impacts of the Project on listed\nbat species shall be provided to the NYSDPS and Office. (iii)\n\nTree Clearing Limitations for Northern\n\nLong-eared Bats\n(a) No tree clearing\nactivities shall occur at any time within one hundred fifty (150) feet of any\nknown maternity roost or one quarter (0.25) mile of any known\nhibernaculum.

This limitation does not include trees less than or equal to\nfour (4) inches in diameter at breast height (DBH). (c) From April 1 to October 31, the following\nrestrictions shall be implemented for all tree clearing activities in the\nfacility site, unless otherwise agreed by the Office: (1)\n\nThe permittee shall leave uncut all snag\nand cavity trees, as defined under the NYSDEC Program Policy ONRDLF-2 Retention\non State Forests, unless their removal is necessary for protection of human\nlife and property. This restriction pertains to trees that are greater than or\nequal to four (4) inches DBH. When necessary, snag or cavity trees may be\nremoved after being cleared by an environmental monitor who shall conduct a\nsurvey for bats exiting the tree. This survey shall begin thirty (30) minutes\nbefore sunset and continue until at least one (1) hour after sunset or until it\nis otherwise too dark to see emerging bats. Unoccupied snag and cavity trees in\nthe approved clearing area shall be removed within forty-eight (48) hours of\nobservation. (2)\n\nIf any bats are\nobserved flying from a tree, or from a tree that has been cut, tree clearing\nactivities within distances required in clause ( a) of this subparagraph, depending on the potential species present, shall be suspended and the NYSDPS\nand the Office shall be notified as soon as possible. The permittee shall have\nan environmental monitor present on site during all tree clearing activities. If any bat activity is noted, a stop work order will immediately be issued and\nshall remain in place until such time as the NYSDPS and the Office have been\nconsulted and authorize resumption of work. (iv)\n\nTree Clearing Limitations for Indiana\n\nBats. (a) No tree clearing activities shall\noccur at any time within five hundred (500) feet of any known maternity roost\nor one quarter (0.25) mile of any known hibernaculum. (b) All tree clearing activities (except for\nhazard tree removal to protect human life or property) occurring within two and\na half (2.5) miles of a maternity roost site or hibernaculum site, but not\nsubject to clause ( a) of this subparagraph, shall be conducted during the\nhibernation season (between November 1 and March 31), without further\nrestrictions unless otherwise approved by the Office. This limitation does not\ninclude trees less than or equal to four (4) inches in DBH or locations above\nthree hundred (300) meters in elevation. (c) From April 1 to October 31, tree clearing\nwithin two and a half (2.5) miles of a maternity roost site or hibernaculum\nsite is limited to trees less than or equal to four (4) inches in DBH or\nlocations above three hundred (300) meters in elevation. (d) Tree clearing may not reduce forest\nhabitat below thirty-five (35) percent of the landcover within two and a half\n(2.5) miles of the maternity roost site or hibernaculum site. (v) To minimize impacts to bats\nfrom wind facilities, the permittee shall comply with the following\nrequirements: (a) Curtailment is required for\nall wind facilities from July 1 - October 1 when wind speeds are at or below\nfive and a half (5.5) m/s and temperatures are at or above ten (10) degrees\n\nCelsius (fifty (50) degrees Fahrenheit) from thirty (30) minutes before sunset\nto thirty (30) minutes after sunrise. Curtailment shall be on an individual\nturbine basis and shall be determined by weather conditions as measured by each\nindividual weather station on the turbine nacelle. (b) The permittee shall submit a review of\ncurtailment operations to the Office as part of the post-construction bat\nmortality monitoring requirements set forth in the NCBP or every five (5) years\n(or sooner if requested by the permittee). The review shall assess if changes\nin technology or knowledge of impacts to bats supports modification of the\nexisting curtailment regime. Modifications to the existing curtailment regime\nthat further decrease mortality may be proposed or negotiated. Any such\nmodifications shall not be costlier than the existing curtailment regime, unless voluntarily supported by the permittee.

The permittee shall immediately stop work\nuntil authorized to proceed by the Office. (q) Wetlands. The permittee\nshall implement the following requirements for freshwater wetlands and adjacent\nareas subject to ECL article 24: (1)\n\nConstruction in Wetlands and Adjacent Areas. All construction\nactivities completed within wetlands and/or adjacent areas shall adhere to the\nfollowing requirements: (i) In breeding areas\nfor NYS threatened or endangered amphibian species, construction should not\noccur during the peak amphibian breeding season (April 1 to June 15) unless\nadditional measures are implemented to prevent impacts or exclude species from\nthe workspace, such as silt fences. (ii)\n\nWork should be conducted during dry\nconditions without standing water or when the ground is frozen, where\npracticable. (iii)\n\nExcavation, installation, and backfilling in wetlands shall be performed in one continuous\noperation. (iv)\n\nTemporary\nconstruction matting shall be used as necessary to minimize disturbance to the\nwetland soil profile during all construction and maintenance activities. All\ntemporary construction matting shall be removed as soon as practicable but no\nlater than four months following installation from the wetland and cleaned of\nany invasive species (seed, plant materials, insects, etc.) after\nconstruction/maintenance activities are completed and removal shall be verified\nwith the on-site environmental monitor after construction. Matting shall be\nremoved by equipment stationed on a mat or areas outside the wetland or\nadjacent area. (v) In the event\nthat construction results in an unanticipated alteration to the hydrology of a\nwetland (i.e., lowering), the breach shall be immediately sealed, and no\nfurther activity shall take place until the NYSDPS and the Office is notified\nand a remediation plan to restore the wetland and prevent future dewatering of\nthe wetland has been approved. (vi)\n\nBefore trenching occurs, upland sections of the trench shall be backfilled or\nplugged to prevent drainage of possible turbid trench water from entering the\nwetland. (vii)\n\nTrench\nbreakers/plugs shall be used at the edges of wetlands as needed to prevent\nwetland draining during construction. (viii)\n\nIn wetland areas, the topsoil shall be\nremoved and stored separate from subsoil. The top twelve (12) inches of wetland\ntopsoil shall be removed first and temporarily placed onto a geo-textile\nblanket. (ix)\n\nOnly the excavated\nwetland topsoil and subsoil shall be utilized as backfill, with the exception\nof clean bedding material for electrical collection lines and/or conduits, provided there is no change to the pre-construction contours upon restoration; and trench-breakers are used to prevent draining the wetland. (x) Subsoil dug from the trench shall be\nsidecast on the opposite side of the trench on another geo-textile blanket\nrunning parallel to the trench, if necessary. (xi)\n\nTrenches shall be backfilled with the\nwetland subsoil and the wetland topsoil shall be placed back on top. All excess\nmaterials shall be completely removed to upland areas more than one hundred\n(100) feet from the wetland and suitably stabilized. (xii)\n\nWhen backfilling occurs, the subsoil\nshall be replaced as needed, and then covered with the topsoil, suchthat the\nrestored topsoil is the same depth as prior to disturbance. (xiii)\n\nAll disturbed soils within wetlands\nand adjacent areas shall be seeded with an appropriate native wetland seed mix, shrubs, live stakes, or tree planting as site conditions and design allow, as\nappropriate for existing land uses. Straw mulch shall be maintained until the\ndisturbed area is permanently stabilized. Hay shall not be used for mulching of\nwetlands or adjacent areas. (xiv)\n\nIn agricultural or farmed wetlands, crop covers consistent with existing\nagricultural uses shall be utilized in all areas of soil disturbance. (xv)\n\nInstallation of underground collection\nlines in wetlands shall be performed using the following methods: (a) The permittee shall implement best\nmanagement practices to minimize soil compaction; (b) During excavation, all topsoil shall be\nstripped and segregated from subsoils. The permittee shall consolidate\ntrenching areas to the maximum extent practicable to minimize impacts to\nagricultural soils; (c) All\nreasonable efforts shall be made to backfill open trenches within the same\nworkday if rain is predicted and as soon as practicable otherwise; and\n(d) All excess materials shall\nbe completely removed from wetlands to upland areas. Excess topsoil from\nagricultural areas shall be spread within the immediate agricultural areas\nwithin the approved LOD, or within other nearby areas that will still be used\nfor agricultural production. (2)\n\nWetland Restoration. (i) Wetland restoration shall be completed\naccording to the approved Wetland Restoration and Mitigation Plan submitted\npursuant to section 1100-10.2(f)(2) of this Part. (ii)\n\nThe permittee shall restore disturbed\nareas, ruts, and rills within of NYSDEC-regulated wetlands and adjacent areas\nto original grades and conditions with permanent native revegetation and\nerosion controls appropriate for those locations. (iii)\n\nRestoration of temporary impacts to\nNYS-regulated wetlands and adjacent areas (as delineated pursuant to section\n1100-1.3(e) of this Part) to pre-construction contours shall be completed\nwithin forty-eight (48) hours of final backfilling of the trench/excavated\nareas and restored to pre-construction contours as soon as\npracticable. (iv)\n\nImmediately upon\ncompletion of grading, and as consistent with existing land use/land cover, the\narea shall be seeded with an appropriate native species mix for wetlands and\nupland areas adjacent to wetlands, except that adjacent areas may be reseeded\ndifferently at the request of the landowner. (v) The permittee shall attain eighty (80)\npercent vegetative cover across all disturbed soil areas by the end of the\nfirst full growing season following construction. Overall vegetative cover in\nrestored areas shall be monitored for a minimum of five (5) years. Postconstruction monitoring shall continue until an eighty (80) percent\nsurvivorship of native woody species or eighty-five (85) percent absolute cover\nof native herbaceous species appropriate wetland indicator status has been\nreestablished over all portions of the replanted area, unless the invasive\nspecies baseline survey indicates a smaller percentage of survivorship or cover\nof appropriate native species exists prior to construction. (3)\n\nCut\n\nVegetation. Cut vegetation in wetlands, with the exception of invasive\nspecies, may be left in place (i.e., drop and lop or piled in dry or seasonally\nsaturated portions of wetlands and adjacent areas to create wildlife brush\npiles). (4)\n\nAccess Roads\n\nThrough Wetlands. Installation of access roads through wetlands shall\nbe performed using the following methods: (i) Temporary access roads shall use timber/construction matting that is completely\nremoved after construction/maintenance activities are completed and removal\nshall be verified with the NYSDPS by the on-site environmental monitor after\nconstruction, or by the facility operator after maintenance work is\ncompleted. (ii)\n\nPermanent access\nroads shall use a layer of geotextile fabric and a minimum of six (6) inches of\ngravel shall be placed in the location of the wetland crossing after vegetation\nand topsoil is removed. Access roads shall be designed and constructed to\nadequately support the type and frequency of the anticipated vehicular traffic\nand include suitable culverting or other drainage infrastructure as needed to\nminimize the impact to wetland hydrology. (5)\n\nSolar Panel Support\n\nInstallation. Installation and construction techniques shall minimize\nthe disturbance of the wetland soil profiles (e.g., the use of helical screws\nand driven H-pile with no backfilling for solar arrays sites in\nwetlands). (6)\n\nTree\n\nClearing. Tree clearing shall be minimized to the extent practicable\nin wetlands and adjacent areas. (7)\n\nFill Placement. The placement of fill in wetlands shall be\ndesigned to maintain pre-construction surface water flows/conditions between\nremaining on- or off-site waters and to prevent draining of the wetland or\npermanent hydrologic alteration. This may require the use of culverts and/or\nother measures. Construction activity and final design shall not restrict or\nimpede the passage of normal or expected high flows. (8)\n\nConcrete Use. For\nactivities involving the placement of concrete into regulated wetlands, watertight forms shall be used. The forms shall be dewatered prior to the\nplacement of the concrete. The use of tremie-supplied concrete is allowed if it\ncomplies with NYS water quality standards. (9)\n\nStormwater Setback. Any\nnew stormwater management infrastructure shall be located outside of the\nwetland and adjacent area to the extent practicable. (10)\n\nMitigation. The\npermittee shall implement the approved Wetland Restoration and Mitigation Plan\nsubmitted pursuant to section 1100-10.2(f)(2) of this Part. (r) Work in NYS-protected\nwaters. The permittee shall implement the following: (1)\n\nDry Conditions. In-stream work shall only occur in dry conditions, using appropriate water\nhandling measures to isolate work areas and direct stream flow around the work\narea. Any waters accumulated in isolated work areas shall be discharged to an\nupland settling basin, field, or wooded area to provide for settling and\nfiltering of solids and sediment before water is return to the stream. If\nmeasures fail to divert all flow around the work area, in-stream work shall\nstop until dewatering measures are functioning properly. (2)\n\nIn-Water Work Windows. In-stream work shall be prohibited from September 15 through May 31 in cold\nwater fisheries and March 15 through July 15 in warm water fisheries unless the\npermittee receives site-specific approval from the Office. (3)\n\nStream Channels. The\nrestored stream channel shall be equal in width, depth, gradient, length and\ncharacter to the pre-existing stream channel and tie in smoothly to the profile\nof the stream channel upstream and downstream of the disturbance. The planform\nof any permanent stream shall not be changed, unless dictated by restoration or\nmitigation objectives. All disturbed stream banks shall be mulched within two\n(2) days of final grading, stabilized with one hundred (100) percent natural or\nbiodegradable fiber matting, and seeded with an appropriate riparian seed\nmix. (4)\n\nFelled Trees in an\nESA. Trees shall not be felled into an ESA stream or its stream bank. Snags which provide shelter in streams for fish shall not be disturbed unless\nthey cause serious obstructions, scouring or erosion. (5)\n\nCulvert Repairs. If a\nculvert is blocked or crushed, or otherwise damaged by construction or\nmaintenance activities, the permittee shall repair the culvert or replace it\nwith alternative measures appropriate to maintaining proper drainage, embedment\nand aquatic connectivity. (6)\n\nAccess Road Crossings of Streams. The creation, modification\nor improvement of any permanent road crossing of a NYS-protected waterbody\nshall meet the following requirements: (i) New culvert pipes that the permittee is required to install shall be designed\nto safely pass the one (1) percent annual chance storm event; (ii)\n\nCulvert pipes shall be embedded beneath\nthe existing grade of the stream channel; (iii)\n\nWidth of the structure shall be a\nminimum of one and a quarter (1.25) times the width of the mean high-water\nchannel, as practicable; and\n(iv)\n\nThe culvert slope shall remain consistent with the slope of the adjacent stream\nchannel. For slopes greater than three (3) percent, an open bottom culvert\nshall be used. (7)\n\nOverhead Lines Across NYSDEC-Protected Streams. If\nconstruction of overhead power line crossings requires cutting of trees or\nshrubs within fifty (50) feet of a NYS-protected waterbody: (i) Cut materials shall be left on the\nground; and\n(ii)\n\nStumps and root\nsystems shall not be damaged to facilitate stump sprouting. (8)\n\nStream Flows. During periods of work activity, flow immediately downstream of the work site\nshall equal flow immediately upstream of the work site. If measures fail to\ndivert all flow around the work area, in-stream work shall stop until\ndewatering measures are functioning properly. (9)\n\nNo Aquatic Impediments. In-stream work, including the installation of structures and bed material, but\nexcluding dewatering associated with dry trench crossings, shall not result in\nan impediment to aquatic organisms. All fish trapped within cofferdams shall be\nnetted and returned, alive and unharmed, to the water outside the confines of\nthe cofferdam, in the same stream. (10)\n\nDrop Height. Any\nin-stream structures placed in a stream shall not create a drop height greater\nthan six (6) inches. (11)\n\nRestoration and Mitigation. The permittee shall implement the\napproved Stream Restoration and Mitigation Plan submitted pursuant to section\n1100-10.2(f)(3) of this Part. (s) Agricultural Resources.
