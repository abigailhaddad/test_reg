Tit. 6 §§ 646-4.14 - Stormwater management plans and stormwater regulatory programs required\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\nmunicipality shall adopt a stormwater management plan, and a stormwater\nregulatory program designed to implement said plan. Stormwater management plans\nand regulatory programs and amendments thereto shall be consistent with the\nrequirements of this Subpart, and subject to the approval of the commission\nbefore they are effective. Plans and programs need not be adopted at the same\ntime. (b) The commission shall\ncontinue the Lake George Park Local Stormwater Planning Assistance Program with\nso much of its funds as are available for that purpose and shall continue to\ncomply with agreements made under that program to provide assistance for local\nstormwater planning. (c) A\nmunicipality may base its stormwater regulatory program upon the Model\n\nStormwater Management Ordinance, Appendix A (see section\n646-4.18\nof this Subpart) and shall modify the ordinance, if necessary, to conform to\nits plan and its land use planning procedures. Where a municipality has revised\nthe model ordinance so that it conforms to its plan and land use planning\nprocedures, the adoption of such an ordinance by the municipality shall require\ncommission approval in accordance with this Subpart. The adoption of the Model\n\nStormwater Management Ordinance, without revision, by a municipality as a local\nordinance or local law shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of this\n\nSubpart and shall be deemed an approved stormwater regulatory\nprogram. (d) The commission may\nenter into an agreement with any municipality for the shared implementation and\nenforcement of stormwater regulatory programs. Such agreements may include\ncommission delegation of some or all of the authority assumed pursuant to\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law, section 43-0112. (e) If any municipality fails to implement a\nstormwater regulatory program approved in accordance with this Subpart, the\ncommission shall assume, after providing for notice and an opportunity to be\nheard, by resolution, the authority to do so pursuant to section\n646-4.7\n(k) of this Subpart. Some sections within this Subpart, referring to stormwater\nregulatory standards and procedures, do not identify the entity which has\ndecisionmaking, implementation and enforcement authority with regard to such\nregulatory standards and procedures. These sections are to be read with the\nknowledge that the entity within such sections is either the commission or a\nmunicipality depending on who has the decisionmaking, implementation and\nenforcement authority pursuant to this Subpart. (f) No plan or program shall be required for\nthe Towns of Horicon, Lake Luzerne and Warrensburg. All development within\nthose municipalities and within the park and within the lake drainage basin\nshall be the subject of agreements between the respective municipality and the\ncommission pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section.
