Tit. 12 § 472.8 - Notice upon separation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every employer liable for contributions shall inform each employee of his right\nto file an application for unemployment benefits with a field office of the\n\nDepartment of Labor. Such information shall be given at the time of each\nseparation from his service if such separation is permanent or for an\nindefinite period. In case of temporary separation or any other interruption of\ncontinued services, such information shall be given only if the employer\nbelieves that it may result in more than three days of unemployment in any\nstatutory week for which the employee's compensation does not exceed the amount\nset forth in section 523 of the Unemployment Insurance Law. Such notice shall\nbe given in writing on a form furnished or approved the Department of Labor and\nshall include: (1)\nthe employer's name and\nregistration number; (2)\nthe\naddress of the employer to which a request for remuneration and employment\ninformation with respect to such employee must be directed; (3)\na statement advising the employee that he\nshould have the form in his possession if and when he reports to an insurance\noffice of the Department of Labor for the purpose of filing an application for\nbenefits; and\n(4)\nsuch other\ninformation as is required by the commissioner. Such notice need not be given if the employer's pay\nvouchers, envelopes or pay check stubs furnished to employees contain the\ninformation and statement required by paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this\nsubdivision.
