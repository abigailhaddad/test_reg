  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2102.4 - Grounds for decrease of maximum rent\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe administrator at any time, on his own initiative, or\non application of the owner or tenant, may order a decrease of the maximum rent\notherwise allowable, only on the grounds that: (a) (1)\n\nWhere a maximum rent has been established for a housing accommodation, other\nthan in a rooming house, pursuant to section\n2101.1\n(d) of this\n\nTitle, and the landlord has filed a proper and timely registration statement\npursuant to section\n2103.3\nof this Title, the\nadministrator may order a decrease in the maximum rent where such maximum rent\nis substantially higher than the maximum rents for comparable housing\naccommodations, giving due consideration to any factors bearing on the equities\ninvolved. (2)\n\nWhere a maximum rent\nhas been established for housing accommodations in rooming houses pursuant to\nsection\n2101.1\n(d), (e) or\n(h) of this Title, and the landlord has filed\na proper and timely registration statement pursuant to section\n2103.3\nof this Title, the\nadministrator may order a decrease in the maximum rent where such maximum rent\nis substantially higher than the maximum rents for comparable accommodations. Such comparability shall be limited to comparable accommodations in the same\nestablishment, if any. The administrator may also order a decrease in the\nmaximum rent where such maximum rent is based on a change in the number of\noccupants or the terms of occupancy and is higher than the amount by which the\nlandlord customarily varied the rent for such number of occupants or terms of\noccupancy as reflected by the maximum rents for such rooms or units and terms\nof occupancy in effect on March 1, 1950, and where the landlord had no such\ncustomary variation and the maximum rent established upon a change in the\nnumber of occupants or the terms of occupancy is more than the rental value of\nsuch changed occupancy. In all such cases the administrator may take into\nconsideration any factors bearing on the equities involved. (b) There has been a substantial\ndeterioration of the housing accommodations because of the failure of the\nlandlord to properly maintain the same, or there has been a decrease in the\ndwelling space, essential services, furniture, furnishings or equipment\nrequired under section\n2101.5\nof this Title. It shall be\nno defense to an application to decrease the maximum rent that furniture or\nfurnishings were removed on or after May 1, 1955 from a furnished housing\naccommodation with the consent of the tenant. (c) A municipal department having\njurisdiction certifies that the housing accommodation is a fire hazard or is in\na continued dangerous condition or detrimental to life or health, or is\noccupied in violation of law. (d) Under subdivision (b) of this section, the maximum rent of the housing\naccommodations shall be decreased by that amount which the administrator finds\nto be the reduction in the rental value of the housing accommodations because\nof the substantial deterioration or decrease in dwelling space, essential\nservices, furniture, furnishings or equipment. The administrator may, however, take into consideration all factors bearing on the equities involved. (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of\nthis Subchapter, where a maximum rent has been established for a housing\naccommodation in a rooming house, the administrator may order a decrease in the\nmaximum rent, having regard for any factors bearing on the equities involved, consistent with the purposes of the act to correct speculative, abnormal and\nunwarranted increases in rent. (f) (1)\n\nNo increase in maximum rent pursuant to\nthese regulations shall be collected from a tenant to whom there has been\nissued a tax abatement certificate pursuant to section\n467-b\nof the Real Property Tax Law as amended by chapter 689, Laws of New York, 1972\n(tax abatement for rent controlled property occupied by senior citizens) except\nas may be prescribed in such certificate. (2)\n\nThe administrator, upon application by\nthe tenant on prescribed forms shall issue such tax abatement certificate where\nhe finds that the tenant is eligible. A tenant shall be eligible for such tax\nabatement certificate if the requirements of section\n467-b\nof the Real Property Tax Law amended by chapter 689 are complied with, and the\ngoverning body of the city, town, or village wherein the housing accommodations\nare located has adopted a local law, ordinance, or resolution in accordance\nwith the provisions of said section. (g) The amount of the reduction in maximum\nrent ordered by the administrator pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section\nshall be reduced by any credit, abatement or offset in rent which the tenant\nhas received pursuant to section\n235-b\nof\nthe Real Property Law, that relates to one or more conditions covered by such\norder\n(h) There has been an\napproved conversion from master metering of electricity, with the cost of\nelectricity included in the rent, to individual metering of electricity, with\nthe tenant paying separately for electricity, and is in amounts set forth in a\n\nSchedule of Rent Reductions for different-sized rent controlled housing\naccommodations included in Operational Bulletin 2014-1 governing electrical\nconversions issued pursuant to this subdivision and section\n2109.8\nof this Title by DHCR, 92-31\n\nUnion Hall Street, Jamaica, Queens, New York, and available at DHCR's website\nat\nwww.hcr.ny.gov, and determined as\nfollows: (1)\n\nDirect Metering: Where the\nconversion is to direct metering of electricity, with the tenant purchasing\nelectricity directly from a utility, such Schedule of Rent Reductions is based\non the median monthly cost of electricity to tenants derived from data from the\n\nUnited States Census Bureau's \" New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey,\" as\ntabulated by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, 1 Centre Street, Suite\n2210, New York, New York, and available on its website at\nrentguidelinesboard.cityofnewyork.us, and as further adjusted where appropriate\nto reflect differences in electric rates outside New York City. The charge for\nelectricity is not part of the maximum rent and is not subject to this\n\nSubchapter. The resolution of any dispute arising from the billing or\ncollection of such charge is not within the jurisdiction of the Commission. A\nconversion to direct metering is required to include rewiring the building\nunless the owner can establish that rewiring is unnecessary. (2)\n\nSubmetering. Where the conversion is to\nsubmetering of electricity, with the tenant purchasing electricity from the\nowner or a contractor retained by the owner, who purchases electricity from a\nutility at the bulk rate, such Schedule of Rent Reductions is based on the\nmedian monthly cost of electricity to tenants derived from data from the United\n\nStates' Census Bureau's \" New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey,\" as\ntabulated by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, 1 Centre Street, Suite\n2210, New York, New York, and available on its website at\nrentguidelinesboard.cityofnewyork.us, adjusted to reflect the bulk rate for\nelectricity plus a reasonable service fee for the cost of meter reading and\nbilling, based on the maximum estimated fee included in the \"Residential\n\nSubmetering Manual\" revised October 2001, published by the New York State\n\nEnergy Research and Development Authority, 17 Columbia Circle, Albany, New\n\nYork, and available on its website at\nwww.nyserda.org, and further adjusted where\nappropriate to reflect differences in electric rates outside New York City, and\nreflected in Operational Bulletin 2014-1. The owner or contractor retained by\nthe owner is not permitted to charge the tenant more than the bulk rate for\nelectricity plus a reasonable service charge for the cost of meter reading and\nbilling. The charge for electricity as well as any related service surcharge is\nnot part of the maximum rent and is not subject to this Subchapter. The\nresolution of any dispute arising from the billing or collection of such charge\nor surcharge is not within the jurisdiction of the Commission. A conversion to\nsubmetering does not require rewiring the building provided the owner submits\nan affidavit sworn to by a licensed electrician that the existing wiring is\nsafe and of sufficient capacity for the building. (3)\n\nRecipients of Senior Citizen Rent\n\nIncrease Exemptions (SCRIE) or Disability Rent Increase Exemptions (DRIE). For\na tenant who on the date of the conversion is receiving a SCRIE or DRIE\nauthorized by section 26-405(m) of the City Rent and Rehabilitation Law, the\nrent is not reduced and the cost of electricity remains included in the rent, although the owner is permitted to install any equipment in such tenant's\nhousing accommodation as is required for effectuation of electrical conversion\npursuant to this subdivision. (i) After the\nconversion, upon the vacancy of the tenant, the owner, without making\napplication to the commission, is required to reduce the maximum rent for the\nhousing accommodation in accordance with the Schedule of Rent Reductions set\nforth in Operational Bulletin 2014-1, and shall not be subject to this\n\nSubchapter. As of June 14, 2019, fuel pass-along to tenants under rent control\nis prohibited. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, rule, regulation, chapter or administrative code, tenants of housing accommodations which are\nsubject to rent control under this chapter shall not be subject to a fuel\nadjustment or pass-along increase in rent and any such increase to such tenant\nshall be null and void. (ii)\n\nAfter\nthe conversion, if a tenant ceases to receive a SCRIE or DRIE, the owner, without making application to the commission, may reduce the rent in accordance\nwith the schedule of rent reductions set forth in Operational Bulletin 2014-1, and thereafter the tenant is responsible for the cost of his or her\nelectricity, and for the legal rent as reduced, including any applicable major\ncapital improvement rent increase based upon the cost of work done to\neffectuate the electrical conversion, for as long as the tenant is not\nreceiving a SCRIE or DRIE. Thereafter, in the event that the tenant resumes\nreceiving a SCRIE or DRIE, the owner, without making application to the\ncommission, is required to eliminate the rent reduction and resume\nresponsibility for the tenant's electric bills. (4)\n\nEvery three years, upon the publication\nof a new New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, and tabulation of the survey\ndata by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, DHCR shall issue a new\n\nOperational Bulletin governing electrical conversions setting forth rent\nreductions based on the new survey data, and shall move to amend the\nregulations to incorporate by reference the new Operational Bulletin, the new\n\nNew York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, and Rent guidelines Board tabulation. At such time as New York State Energy Research and Development Authority issues\na new Residential Electric Submetering Manual setting forth a new maximum\nestimated submetering service fee, DHCR shall move to amend the regulations to\nincorporate that document by reference. (i) (1)\n\nCertain conditions complained of as constituting a substantial deterioration of\na housing accommodation because of a reduction in an essential service may be\nde minimis in nature, and therefore do not rise to the level of a failure to\nmaintain an essential service for the purposes of this section. Such conditions\nare those that have only a minimal impact on tenants, do not affect the use and\nenjoyment of the premises, and may exist despite regular maintenance of\nservices. The following schedule sets forth conditions that will\ngenerally not constitute a failure to maintain an essential service. However, this schedule is not intended to be exclusive, and is not determinative in all\ncases and under all circumstances. Therefore, it does not include all\nconditions that may be considered de minimis, and there may be circumstances\nwhere a condition, although included on the schedule, will nevertheless be\nfound to constitute a decrease in an essential service.

(2)\n\nIn determining\nwhether a condition is de minimis, the administrator may consider the passage\nof time during which a disputed service was not provided and during which no\ncomplaint was filed by any tenant alleging failure to maintain such disputed\nservice, as evidencing that such service condition is de minimis, and therefore\ndoes not constitute a failure to maintain an essential service, provided that: (i) for purposes of this subdivision, the\npassage of four years or more shall be considered presumptive evidence that the\ncondition is de minimis, with such four-year period to be measured without\nreference to any changes in building ownership or the tenancy of the subject\nhousing accommodation; (ii)\nservices required to be provided by laws or regulations other than the Rent Law\nand this Subchapter shall not be subject to this\nsubdivision. (3)\n(i) Except as to complaints of inadequate\nheat and/or hot water, or applications relating to the restoration of rents\nbased upon the restoration of such services, whenever a complaint of\nbuilding-wide reduction in services, or a landlord's application relating to\nthe restoration of rents based upon the restoration of such services is filed, the tenants or owner may submit with the complaint, answer or application, the\ncontemporaneous affidavit of an independent licensed architect or engineer, substantiating the allegations of the complaint, answer, or application. The\naffidavit shall state that the conditions that are the subject of the\ncomplaint, answer or application were investigated by the person signing the\naffidavit and that the conditions exist (if the affidavit is offered by the\ntenants) or do not exist (if the affidavit is offered by the landlord).

The affidavit shall state when the\ninvestigation was conducted, must be submitted within a reasonable time after\nthe completion of the investigation, and when served by the administrator on\nthe opposing party, will raise a rebuttable presumption that the conditions\nthat are the subject of the complaint, answer or application exist (if the\naffidavit is submitted by the tenants), or do not exist (if the affidavit is\nsubmitted by the landlord). (ii)\n\nThe presumption raised by the affidavit may be rebutted only on the basis of\npersuasive evidence, including a counter affidavit by an independent licensed\narchitect or engineer, or a report of a subsequent inspection conducted, or a\nsubsequent violation imposed by a governmental agency, or an affirmation signed\nby 51 percent of the complaining tenants. Except for good cause shown, failure\nto rebut the presumption within 30 days will result in the issuance of an order\nwithout any further physical inspection of the premises by the\nadministrator. (iii)\n\nThere must be\nno common ownership, or other financial interest, between such architect or\nengineer, and the landlord or tenants, and the affidavit shall state that there\nis no such relationship or other financial interest. The affidavit must also\ncontain a statement that the architect or engineer did not engage in the\nperformance of any work, other than the investigation, relating to the\nconditions that are the subject of the affidavit, and must contain the original\nsignature and professional stamp of the architect or engineer, not a copy.
