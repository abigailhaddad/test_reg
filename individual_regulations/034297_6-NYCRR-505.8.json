  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 505.8 - Restrictions on regulated activities within natural protective feature areas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Nearshore\nareas. The following restrictions and requirements apply to regulated\nactivities in nearshore areas: (1)\n\nExcavating, grading, mining or dredging which diminishes the erosion protection\nafforded by nearshore areas is prohibited. However, coastal erosion management\npermits for dredging may be issued for constructing or maintaining navigation\nchannels, bypassing sand around natural and man-made obstructions, or\nartificial beach nourishment. (2)\n\nAll development is prohibited in nearshore areas unless specifically allowed by\nthis subdivision. (3)\n\nThe normal\nmaintenance of structures may be undertaken without a coastal erosion\nmanagement permit. (4)\n\nClean sand, or gravel of an equivalent or slightly larger grain size, is the only material\nwhich may be deposited within nearshore areas. Any deposition will require a\ncoastal erosion management permit. (5)\nA coastal erosion management permit is\nrequired for new construction, modification or restoration of docks, piers, wharves, groins, jetties, seawalls, bulkheads, breakwaters, revetments and\nartificial beach nourishment. Docks, piers, wharves or structures built on\nfloats, columns, open timber, piles or similar open-work supports having a top\nsurface area of 200 square feet or less, or docks, piers, wharves or other\nstructures built on floats and removed in the fall of each year, are expected\nfrom this permit requirement. (b) Beaches. The following restrictions and\nrequirements apply to regulated activities on beaches: (1)\n\nExcavating, grading or mining which\ndiminishes the erosion protection afforded by beaches is prohibited. (2)\n\nAll development is prohibited on beaches\nunless specifically allowed by this subdivision. (3)\n\nThe normal maintenance of structures may\nbe undertaken without a coastal erosion management permit. (4)\n\nThe restoration of existing structures\nthat are damaged or destroyed by events not related to coastal flooding and\nerosion may be undertaken without a coastal erosion management\npermit. (5)\n\nNonmajor additions to\nexisting structures that are damaged or destroyed by events not related to\ncoastal flooding and erosion may be undertaken without a coastal erosion\nmanagement permit. (6)\n\nThe\nfollowing restrictions apply to the use of motor vehicles on beaches: (i) motor vehicles must operate seaward of\nthe upper debris lines at all times. On those beaches where no debris line\nexists, motor vehicles must operate seaward of the toe of the primary dune; and\n(ii)\nmotor vehicles must not\ntravel on vegetation. (7)\nA coastal erosion management permit for\ndeposition of material on beaches will be issued only for expansion or\nstabilization of beaches; clean sand, or gravel of an equivalent or slightly\nlarger grain size, must be used. (8)\n\nBeach grooming or clean-up operations do\nnot require a coastal erosion management permit. (9)\nA coastal erosion management permit is\nrequired for new construction, modification or restoration of docks, piers, wharves, boardwalks, groins, jetties, seawalls, bulkheads, breakwaters, revetments, and artificial beach nourishment. Docks, piers, wharves or\nstructures built on floats, columns, open timber, piles or similar open-work\nsupports having a top surface area of 200 square feet or less, or docks, piers, wharves or other structures built on floats and removed in the fall of each\nyear, are excepted from this permit requirement. (10)\n\nActive bird nesting and breeding areas\nmust not be disturbed unless such disturbance is pursuant to a specific\nwildlife management activity approved in writing by the department. (c) Bluffs. The following\nrestrictions and requirements apply to regulated activities on bluffs. (1)\n\nExcavating, grading or mining of bluffs\nis prohibited, except where: (i) the minor\nalteration of a bluff is done in accordance with conditions stated in a coastal\nerosion management permit issued for the construction of an erosion protection\nstructure; or\n(ii)\na bluff cut is\nmade in a direction perpendicular to the shoreline to provide shoreline access. The ramp slope of bluff cuts must not be steeper than 1:6 and the side slopes\nmust not be steeper than 1:3, if not terraced or otherwise structurally\nstabilized. Side slopes and other disturbed nonroadway areas must be stabilized\nwith vegetation or other approved physical means, and completed roadways must\nbe stabilized and drainage provided for, all in accordance with terms and\nconditions of a coastal erosion management permit. (2)\n\nVehicular traffic is prohibited on\nbluffs. (3)\n\nAll development is\nprohibited on bluffs unless specifically allowed by this subdivision. (4)\n\nThe normal maintenance of structures may\nbe undertaken without a coastal erosion management permit. (5)\n\nThe restoration of existing structures\nthat are damaged or destroyed by events not related to coastal flooding and\nerosion may be undertaken without a coastal erosion management\npermit. (6)\n\nNonmajor additions to\nexisting structures may be allowed on bluffs pursuant to a coastal erosion\nmanagement permit. (7)\nA coastal\nerosion management permit is required for new construction, modification or\nrestoration of erosion protection structures, walkways or stairways. Elevated\nwalkways or stairways constructed solely for pedestrian use and built by or for\nan individual property owner for the limited purpose of providing noncommercial\naccess to the beach are excepted from this permit requirement. (8)\n\nActive bird nesting and breeding areas\nmust not be disturbed unless such disturbance is pursuant to a specific\nwildlife management activity approved in writing by the department. (9)\n\nAny grading, excavating, or other soil\ndisturbance conducted on a bluff must not direct surface water runoff over a\nbluff face. (d) Primary\ndunes. The following restrictions and requirements apply to regulated\nactivities on primary dunes: (1)\n\nExcavating, grading or mining of primary dunes is prohibited. (2)\n\nVehicular traffic is prohibited on\nprimary dunes, except in those areas designated by the department for dune\ncrossing. (3)\n\nNonmajor additions to\nexisting structures are allowed on primary dunes pursuant to a coastal erosion\nmanagement permit and subject to permit conditions concerning the location, design and potential impacts of the structure on the primary dune. (4)\n\nFoot traffic which causes sufficient\ndamage to primary dunes to diminish the erosion protection afforded by them is\nprohibited. Pedestrian passage across primary dunes must utilize elevated\nwalkways and stairways, or other specially designed dune-crossing structures\napproved by the department. (5)\n\nAll\ndevelopment is prohibited on primary dunes unless specifically allowed by this\nsubdivision. (6)\n\nThe normal\nmaintenance of structures may be undertaken without a coastal erosion\nmanagement permit. (7)\n\nThe\nrestoration of existing structures that are damaged or destroyed by events not\nrelated to coastal flooding and erosion may be undertaken without a coastal\nerosion management permit. (8)\nA\ncoastal erosion management permit is required for new construction, modification or restoration of stone revetments or other erosion-protection\nstructures compatible with primary dunes. Such erosion-protection structures\nwill only be allowed at the seaward toe of primary dunes and must not interfere\nwith the exchange of sand between primary dunes and their fronting\nbeaches. (9)\nA coastal erosion\nmanagement permit is required for new construction, modification or restoration\nof elevated walkways or stairways. Elevated walkways or stairways constructed\nsolely for pedestrian use and built by or for an individual property owner for\nthe limited purpose of providing noncommercial access to the beach are excepted\nfrom this permit requirement. (10)\n\nClean sand obtained from excavation, dredging or beach grading may be deposited\non a primary dune, or on an area formerly a primary dune, to increase its size\nor restore it. Such deposition must be vegetatively stabilized using native\nspecies tolerant to salt spray and sand burial, e.g., American beach grass. Such deposition requires a coastal erosion management permit. (11)\n\nVegetative planting and sand fencing, to\nstabilize or entrap sand in order to maintain or increase the height and width\nof dunes, does not require a coastal erosion management permit. Vegetative\nplantings must be of native species tolerant to salt spray and sand burial, e.g., American beach grass. (12)\n\nActive bird nesting and breeding areas must not be disturbed unless such\ndisturbance is pursuant to a specific wildlife management activity approved in\nwriting by the department. (e) Secondary dunes. The following\nrestrictions and requirements apply to regulated activities in areas identified\non coastal erosion hazard area maps as secondary dunes: (1)\n\nSecondary dunes must not be excavated, graded or mined such that the erosion protection afforded by them is\ndiminished. (2)\n\nClean sand obtained\nfrom excavation, dredging, or beach grading may be deposited on a secondary\ndune, or an area formerly a secondary dune, to increase its size or restore it. Such deposition must be vegetatively stabilized using native species tolerant\nto salt spray and sand burial, e.g., American beach grass. Such deposition\nrequires a coastal erosion management permit. (3)\n\nThe normal maintenance of structures may\nbe undertaken without a coastal erosion management permit. (4)\n\nThe construction, modification, or\nrestoration of a structure, or major addition to an existing structure, requires a coastal erosion management permit. Permit requirements include: (i) a new structure, or the restoration of or\nmajor addition to an existing structure, must be built on adequately anchored\npilings such that at least three feet of open space exists between the lowest, horizontal structural members, e.g., floor joists, and the surface of the\nsecondary dune; and\n(ii)\nthe space\nbelow the lowest horizontal structural members must be left open and free of\nobstructions. (5)\n\nExceptions. (i) The provision contained in\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision that requires obtaining a coastal erosion\nmanagement permit for the construction, modification, or restoration of a\nstructure or major addition to an existing structure, does not apply to\nelevated walkways or stairways constructed solely for pedestrian use and built\nby or for an individual property owner for the limited purpose of providing\nnoncommercial access to the beach. (ii)\n\nThe restoration of existing structures\nthat are damaged or destroyed by events not related to coastal flooding and\nerosion may be undertaken without a coastal erosion management\npermit. (6)\n\nNonmajor\nadditions to existing structures are allowed on secondary dunes pursuant to a\ncoastal erosion management permit. (7)\n\nVegetative planting and sand fencing, to\nstabilize or entrap sand to maintain or increase the height and width of dunes, does not require a coastal erosion management permit. Vegetative plantings must\nbe of native species tolerant to salt spray and sand burial, such as American\nbeach grass. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
