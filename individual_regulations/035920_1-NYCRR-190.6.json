The shell must be clean, unbroken and practically normal. The air cell must not exceed 1/8 inch in\ndepth, may show unlimited movement and may be free or bubbly. The white must be\nclear and firm so that the yolk is only slightly defined when the egg is\ntwirled before the candling light. The yolk must be practically free from\napparent defects. (b) A quality. The shell must be clean, unbroken and practically normal. The air cell must not\nexceed 3/16 inch in depth, may show unlimited movement, and may be free or\nbubbly. The white must be clear and at least reasonably firm so that the yolk\noutline is only fairly well defined when the egg is twirled before the candling\nlight. (c) B quality. The shell\nmust be unbroken, may be abnormal, and may have slightly stained areas. Moderately stained areas are permitted if they do not cover more than 1/32 of\nthe shell surface if localized, or 1/16 of the shell surface if scattered. Eggs\nhaving shells with prominent stains or adhering dirt are not permitted. The air\ncell may be over 3/16 inch in depth, may show unlimited movement, and may be\nfree or bubbly. The white may be weak and watery so that the yolk outline is\nplainly visible when the egg is twirled before the candling light. The yolk may\nappear dark, enlarged, and flattened, and may show clearly visible germ\ndevelopment. It may show other serious defects that do not render the egg\ninedible. Small blood spots or meat spots (aggregating not more than 1/8 inch\nin diameter) may be present. (d) Dirty. An individual egg that has an unbroken shell with adhering dirt or\nforeign material, prominent stains, or moderate stains covering more than\n1/32of the shell surface if localized, or 1/16 of the shell surface if\nscattered. (e) Check. An individual\negg that has a broken or cracked shell but with its shell membranes in tact and\nthe contents of which do not leak. A \"check\" is considered to be lower in\nquality than a \"dirty\". Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
