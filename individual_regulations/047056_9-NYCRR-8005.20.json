  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8005.20 - Final revocation hearing determination\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If the\npresiding officer is not satisfied that there is clear and convincing evidence\nin support of any of the violation charges, they must dismiss the charges and\nrestore the releasee to supervision. (b) If the presiding officer is satisfied\nthat there clear and convincing evidence in support of a violation charge or\ncharges, and that the alleged violator violated one or more of the conditions\nof release in an important respect, they shall so find. (c) Where one or more charges of violation\nare sustained pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, the presiding\nofficer shall revoke the violator's release. Upon a decision to revoke the\nviolator's release and following consideration of relevant mitigating and\naggravating factors as set forth in subdivision (g) of this section, the\npresiding officer may: (1)\nrestore such\nviolator to supervision, and in their discretion impose conditions directly\nrelated to such restoration, including but not limited to direction that the\nreleasee cooperate with re-entry services provided in the community by a\nqualified non-profit agency; or (2) where reincarceration is permitted, impose\none or more time assessments. The presiding officer shall impose the least\nrestrictive reasonable sanction. (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of\nthis Part, if in a case alleging non-technical violations the alleged violator, the Department and the presiding officer agree, the alleged violator's release\nmay be revoked upon a guilty plea to a charge other than one alleging conduct\nthat would constitute a felony or misdemeanor offense but with the\nunderstanding that they will be deemed, and treated as, a non-technical\nviolator. In such case if a period of reincarceration is directed, it shall be\nfor no less than 3 months. (e) Time\nassessments. (1)\nA time assessment may be\nimposed for each such sustained violation wherein reincarceration is permitted\nby the sustaining of such charge. When there is more than one time assessment\nimposed in the case, such time assessments will run concurrently. (2)\n\nTechnical violation cases. (i) Where one or more violation charges are\nsustained in a technical violation case for which reincarceration may have been\npossible, those current sustained charges and sustained charges in all prior\nrevocation cases on the instant term(s) must be reviewed to determine whether\nreincarceration is a permitted disposition in the current case, with the\nfollowing understanding: no period of reincarceration may be imposed for the\nfirst and second substantiated technical violations for which incarceration may\nbe imposed; up to seven days reincarceration may be imposed for the third\nsubstantiated technical violation for which incarceration may be imposed; up to\nfifteen days reincarceration may be imposed for the fourth substantiated\ntechnical violation for which incarceration may be imposed; up to thirty days\nreincarceration may be imposed for the fifth and subsequent substantiated\ntechnical violations for which incarceration may be imposed. (ii)\n\nUpon the review in subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph, the presiding officer may impose a time assessment only where\nthere are at least three qualifying \"for which incarceration may be imposed\"\nviolations sustained within the current case, or at least one such charge\nsustained in the current case which may be combined with such qualifying\nsustained prior violations on the instant term(s) as to reach the threshold of\nthree sustained such violations. (iii)\n\nNotwithstanding the above, in any case\nwherein a charge of absconding from supervision is sustained, a time assessment\nmay be imposed, with the following understanding: up to seven days\nreincarceration may be imposed for the first absconding violation, up to\nfifteen days reincarceration may be imposed for the second absconding\nviolation, and up to thirty days reincarceration may be imposed for the third\nor any subsequent absconding violation. Where a charge or charges of absconding\nare sustained in the current case, prior sustained absconding violations shall\nbe considered in accordance with this subparagraph but any absconding violation\nshall be considered in accord with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph where a\ngreater time assessment may result and provided moreover, nothing herein shall\nbe construed as prohibiting any other time assessments in such matter in accord\nwith subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (iv)\n\nWhere one or more time assessments are\nimposed in these cases, they are to be imposed in accordance with the\nunderstandings in this paragraph, with a presumption, in such instance, that\nthe maximum available period(s) of reincarceration will be imposed. (3)\n\nNon-technical violation cases. (i) Where one or more non-technical violation\ncharges alleging the commission of a new felony or misdemeanor offense are\nsustained in the current case, a time assessment for each such violation may be\nimposed, which shall be: no less than 6 months for a misdemeanor except one\nunder Penal Law Article 130; no less than 12 months for any felony, or for any\nmisdemeanor under Article 130. (ii)\n\nWhere the violator is serving a sentence for an offense defined in article 130\nof the penal law or section 255.26 or 255.27 of such law, and the sustained\ncharge(s) are considered non-technical in accordance with subdivision (a) of\nsection\n8004.8\nand are not for a felony or\nmisdemeanor offense, a time assessment for each such violation may be imposed, which shall be no less than 6 months. (iii)\n\nNothing herein shall be construed as\nprohibiting other time assessments in the case as may appropriately correspond\nto any sustained technical violation charges. (f) No violator shall be restored to\nsupervision in the community upon a decision revoking such violator's release\nunless the presiding officer concludes that such violator's needs, as related\nto the violative behavior, could be appropriately addressed in the community\nwith community supervision and that a restoration to supervision would not have\nan adverse effect on public safety and public confidence in the integrity of\nthe criminal justice system. The presiding officer may, when directing that the\nviolator be restored to supervision, impose appropriate special conditions of\nrelease. Such conditions may be modified or removed, solely upon the initiation\nof the Department, by a member or members of the Board of Parole. (g) Mitigating and aggravating factors. Where\none or more charges of violation are sustained pursuant to subdivision (b) of\nthis section and the violator's release is revoked, the resulting disposition\nshall be in the interests of public safety and justice. In all cases the\npresiding officer will consider mitigating and aggravating factors in\ndetermining the appropriate sanction.
