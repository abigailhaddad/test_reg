(1)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in\nsubdivisions (b) and (c) of this section, an employee necessarily absent from\nduty because of occupational injury or disease as defined in the Workers'\nCompensation Law, upon giving notice to his appointing authority that he is\nabsent on account of such injury or disease and that he claims benefits under\nsuch law, shall be allowed leave from his position for the period of absence\nnecessitated by such injury or disease, up to cumulatively one year including\nany periods of such absence during which the employee draws vacation, sick\nleave or other leave credits. Such leave may be extended for further periods in\nthe discretion of the appointing authority. (2)\n\nUpon granting workers' compensation leave\npursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of this section, the appointing authority\nshall provide the employee in writing with the notice specified in section\n5.9\n(b) of this\n\nTitle, within the time prescribed by that rule. (3)\n\nNo less than 30 days nor more than 60\ndays prior to the anticipated expiration of an employee's workers' compensation\nleave, or the effective date of a termination of the leave by the employer\npursuant to section\n71\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law upon a finding that the unfitness to perform the duties of\nthe position is permanent where that determination does not arise from a\nhearing, the appointing authority shall provide the employee in writing with\nthe notice specified in section\n5.9\n(c)(2)\nof this\n\nTitle. If for any reason less than 30 days would remain prior to the date of\ntermination of leave, if that termination is not the result of a hearing, service of the notice shall be deemed to be a grant by the appointing authority\nof an extension of the leave to a date 30 days from the date of service of this\nnotice. (b) Controverted\ncases. If the employee's claim for benefits under the Workers' Compensation Law\nis controverted by the State Insurance Fund (at the request of the appointing\nauthority or on its own initiative) and the appointing officer is so notified, the employee shall not be entitled to leave under this section. This shall not, however, adversely affect the employee's eligibility for leave under other\nprovisions of this Chapter. If final determination of the controverted claim is\nin favor of the employee, he shall be entitled to leave under this section, and\nall absences before such final determination, to the extent that the same were\nnecessitated by his occupational injury or disease, shall be deemed to have\nbeen pursuant to leave under this section. (c) Permanent incapacity. Leave under this\nsection may be withheld or terminated if the appointing authority determines\nthat the occupational injury or disease suffered by the employee is of such a\nnature as to permanently incapacitate him for the performance of the duties of\nhis position. (d) Pay during leave. An employee on leave under this section may receive pay, as follows: (1)\n\nThe appointing authority upon finding\nthat the employee is in fact disabled from the performance of his duties, may\ngrant the employee full pay during such leave not exceeding cumulatively six\nmonths. Such full pay may be granted irrespective of the employee's accrued\ncredits under this Chapter. (2)\n\nExcept when on full pay status under paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the\nemployee may draw accrued vacation, overtime and sick leave credits, subject to\nthe provisions of this Chapter pertaining thereto. (3)\n\nIf not drawing full pay under paragraph\n(1) or paragraph (2) of this subdivision, an employee may, in the discretion of\nthe appointing authority, be allowed to draw personal leave and sick leave at\nhalf pay for which he may be eligible under this Chapter. (e) Accrual of leave credits. An employee who\nreceives full pay for any period of leave under this section shall earn\nvacation and sick leave credits during such period. (f) Award credited to State. An award by the\n\nWorkers' Compensation Board of compensation for any period for which the\nemployee receives or received pay from the State shall be credited to the State\nas reimbursement of wages paid. (g) Restoration of leave credits. Leave credits, including sick leave at half pay, used by an employee during a period of absence for which an award of\ncompensation has been made and credited to the State as reimbursement for wages\npaid shall be restored to him in full; provided, however, that no restoration\nshall be made for any absence of less than a full day. Credits so restored may\nnot again be used for future absences attributable to the same injury. In the\nevent that the employee dies, resigns, retires or continues absent beyond one\nyear without further leave, cash payment for vacation and overtime credits, including any credits restored under this subdivision, shall be made in\naccordance with the appropriate provisions of this Chapter. In any other case, an employee restored to service after absence on leave under this section shall\nhave one year from the date of such restoration to reduce his accrued leave\ncredits to the limits prescribed in this Chapter. (h) Return to duty. Upon request of the\nemployee for restoration to duty at or prior to the expiration of the maximum\nperiod of allowed leave, the appointing authority, if in doubt as to whether\nthe employee is physically and mentally fit to perform the duties of the\nposition, may require the employee to undergo medical examination, by a\nphysician designated by the appointing authority, before the employee may be\nrestored to duty. If restoration to duty is denied, the employee may make\napplication therefor in the manner prescribed by section\n5.9\nof this Title. If an employee's\nemployment is terminated as a matter of law due to continued absence after the\nexpiration of the maximum period of allowed leave, or due to a finding of\npermanent disability, eligibility for reinstatement shall be governed by\nsection\n71\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law and section\n5.9\nof this Title. (i) Medical examination. In order to enable\nthe appointing authority to make such determinations as are authorized or\nrequired under this section, the appointing authority may require an employee\nat any time to be examined by a physician designated by the appointing\nauthority. (j) Where the appointing\nauthority has refused to grant the employee pay during leave pursuant to\nsubdivision (d) of this section, the employee may request the Civil Service\n\nCommission to review the determination of the appointing authority. If the\ncommission finds that such determination of the appointing authority is\narbitrary or unreasonable, it may reverse or modify such determination. Where\nthe appointing authority has withheld or terminated a leave of absence on the\nground that the occupational injury or disease is of such a nature as to\npermanently incapacitate the employee for performance of the duties of the\nposition, and the employee disputes the issue of permanence of incapacitation, the employee may apply for continued leave up to a maximum of one year in\naggregate, restoration to duty or reinstatement to employment, pursuant to the\nprocedures of section\n5.9\nof this Title. (k) Construction. This section shall not be\nconstrued to require extension of any employment beyond the time at which it\nwould otherwise terminate. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
