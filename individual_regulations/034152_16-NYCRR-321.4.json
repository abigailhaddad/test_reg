Tit. 16 § 321.4 - Submission of questions\n\nState Regulations\n\nTo maintain uniformity of accounting, utilities shall\nsubmit questions of doubtful interpretation to the commission for consideration\nand decision. Utilities shall also ask for instructions, if occasion arises, regarding the accounting for such transactions as spreading over a number of\nmonths relatively large income or expense items which if included in the\naccounts for a single month would seriously distort the accounts; the\ndisposition of items which relate to transactions which occurred prior to the\ncurrent calendar year but which were not recorded in the books of account in\nthe prior year and which are relatively so large that inclusion in the accounts\nfor a single year would seriously distort the accounts; and expenditures for\nreplacement of units of property leased from others. Ordinary delayed items\nshall be charged or credited to the same accounts which would have been charged\nor credited if the items had not been delayed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n321.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
