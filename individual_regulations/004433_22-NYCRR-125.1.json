Tit. 22 § 125.1 - Engagement of counsel\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Engagement of counsel shall be a\nground for adjournment of an action or proceeding in accordance with this\nrule. (b) Engagement\nof counsel shall mean actual engagement on trial or in argument before any\n\nState or Federal trial or appellate court, or in a proceeding conducted\npursuant to rule 3405 of the CPLR and the rules promulgated\nthereunder. (c) Subject to the provisions of subdivision (f) of this section, where an attorney\nhas conflicting engagements in the same court or different courts, the affected\ncourts shall determine in which matters adjournments shall be granted and in\nwhich matters the parties shall proceed. In making such decisions, they shall, to the extent lawful and practicable, give priority to actions and proceedings\nin the order in which matters are listed below: (1)\nchild protective\nproceedings; (2)\ncriminal proceedings or juvenile delinquency proceedings wherein the defendant\nor respondent is incarcerated; (3)\nproceedings based on acts which\nconstitute felonies; (4)\nproceedings based on acts which\nconstitute misdemeanors; (5)\nmatrimonial actions and\nproceedings; and\n(6)\ncivil actions and proceedings, including proceedings conducted pursuant to rule\n3405 of the CPLR and the rules promulgated thereunder. Where an attorney's\nconflicting engagements include two or more engagements within any one of these\ncategories of actions and proceedings, as between those engagements the\naffected courts shall give priority to those involving jury trials. (d) Subject to the\nprovisions of subdivisions (c) and (f) of this section, where an attorney has\nconflicting engagements, such attorney must proceed in whichever matter is\nentitled to a statutory preference or, if there is none and none of his or her\nengagements involves exceptional circumstances, in the particular matter first\nscheduled for the date on which the conflict arises. Matters involving\nexceptional circumstances shall be given priority over all others, except those\nentitled to statutory preference. A court may find exceptional circumstances\nwhere: (1)\nthere are four or\nmore attorneys engaged for a trial, hearing or appellate argument therein; (2)\na party or\nmaterial witness will be available for a trial or hearing therein only on the\ndate on which the conflict arises or on any subsequent date during the period\nsuch trial or hearing reasonably can be expected to extend; (3)\na party or material\nwitness thereto is afflicted with an illness which, because of its nature, requires that the trial of the action or proceeding be held on the date on\nwhich the conflict arises; or\n(4)\na trial therein must be conducted\nwithin statutory time limits and, if trial of the matter is not held on the\ndate on which the conflict arises, there is a reasonable probability that the\ntime limit applicable thereto will elapse. (e) (1)\n\nEach engagement shall be proved by\naffidavit or affirmation, filed with the court together with proof of service\non all parties, setting forth: (i) the title of the action or\nproceeding in which counsel is engaged; (ii)\nits general nature; (iii)\nthe court and part in\nwhich it is scheduled or, if it is a proceeding conducted pursuant to rule 3405\nof the CPLR, the court in which the underlying action was commenced; (iv)\nthe name of the judge or\npanel chairman who will preside over it; and\n(v) the date and time the engagement is\nto commence, or did commence, and the date and time of its probable\nconclusion. (2)\n\nIn determining an application for\nadjournment on the ground of engagement elsewhere, the court shall consider the\naffidavit of engagement and may make such further inquiry as it deems\nnecessary, including: (i) the\ndates on which each of the actions or proceedings involved were scheduled for\nthe date on which they conflict; (ii)\nwhether or not the actions or\nproceedings involved were marked peremptorily for trial or were the subject of\nsome other special marking; (iii)\nthe number of times each of the\nactions or proceedings involved was previously adjourned, and upon whose\napplication; (iv)\nif\nany of the attorneys representing a party to one of the actions or proceedings\ninvolved is a member or associate of a law firm or office employing more than\none attorney, the number of members or associates of his or her firm or office\nalso serving as cocounsel or otherwise involved in such action or proceeding, and their respective engagements elsewhere; and\n(v) if applicable, the period\nof time each of the actions or proceedings involved has been on a calendar from\nwhich it has been called. (f) Where a trial already has\ncommenced, and an attorney for one of the parties has an engagement elsewhere, there shall be no adjournment of the ongoing trial except in the sole\ndiscretion of the judge presiding thereat; provided that the judge presiding\nshall grant a reasonable adjournment where the engagement is in an appellate\ncourt. (g) This\nsubdivision shall apply where a date for trial of action or proceeding is fixed\nat least two months in advance thereof upon the consent of all attorneys or by\nthe court. In such event, the attorneys previously designated as trial counsel\nmust appear for trial on that date. If any of such attorneys is actually\nengaged on trial elsewhere, he or she must produce substitute trial counsel. If\nneither trial counsel nor substitute trial counsel is ready to try the case on\nthe scheduled date, the court may impose any sanctions permitted by\nlaw. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
