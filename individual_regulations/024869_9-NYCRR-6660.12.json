The ombudsman sha ll investigate a complaint, including but not\nlimited to a complaint related to abuse, neglect, or exploitation, for the\npurposes of resolving the complaint to the resident's satisfaction and/or\nprotecting the health, welfare, and rights of the resident. The o mbudsman may\nidentify, investigate and resolve a complaint impacting multiple residents or\nall residents of a facility. (b) Regardless of the source of the complaint, including when the source is the\nombudsman, the ombudsman must support and maximize resident participation in\nthe process of resolving the complaint as follows: (1)\n\nThe ombudsman shall offer privacy to the\nresident for the purpose of confidentially providing information and hearing, investigating and resolving complaints. (2)\n\nThe ombudsman shall personally discuss\nthe complaint with the resident (and, if the resident is unable to communicate\ninformed consent, the resident's representative) in order to: (i) determine the perspective of the resident\n(or resident representative, where applicable) of the complaint; (ii)\nrequest the resident (or resident\nrepresentative, where applicable) to communicate informed consent in order to\ninvestigate the complaint; (iii)\ndetermine the wishes of the resident (or resident representative, where\napplicable) with respect to resolution of the complaint, including whether the\nallegations are to be reported and, if so, whether ombudsman may disclose\nresident identifying information or other relevant information to the facility\nand/or appropriate agencies; (iv)\nadvise the resident (and resident representative, where applicable) of the\nresident's rights; (v) work with\nthe resident (or resident representative, where applicable) to develop a plan\nof action for resolution of the complaint; (vi)\ninvestigate the complaint to determine\nwhether the complaint can be verified; and\n(vii)\ndetermine whether the complaint is\nresolved to the satisfaction of the resident (or resident representative, where\napplicable). (3)\n\nWhere\nthe resident is unable to communicate informed consent, and has no resident\nrepresentative, the ombudsman shall: (i) take\nappropriate steps to investigate and work to resolve the complaint in order to\nprotect the health, safety, welfare and rights of the resident, including, where appropriate, following the provisions of 9 NYCRR\n6660.14; and\n(ii)\nto the best of the ombudsman's ability, determine whether the complaint was resolved to the satisfaction of the\nresident or complainant. (4)\n\nIn determining whether to rely upon a\nresident representative to communicate or make determinations on behalf of the\nresident related to complaint processing, the ombudsman shall ascertain the\nextent of the authority that has been granted to the resident representative\nunder court order (in the case of a guardian or conservator), by power of\nattorney, or other document by which the resident has granted authority to the\nrepresentative, or under other applicable state or federal law. (c) For purposes of this section, if a resident is unable to communicate his or her informed consent, or\nperspective on the extent to which the matter has been satisfactorily resolved, the ombudsman may rely on the communication of informed consent and/or\nperspective regarding the resolution of the complaint of a resident\nrepresentative so long as the ombudsman has no reasonable cause to believe that\nthe resident representative is not acting in the best interests.
