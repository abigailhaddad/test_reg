  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 701.7 - Procedures for inmates in special housing units (shu's)\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe IGP supervisor shall monitor and ensure the proper\nfunctioning of the grievance procedure in SHU's. The following minimal\nstandards shall be instituted to provide SHU inmates with access to the\nIGP: (a) Forms and envelopes. (1)\nA supply of inmate grievance complaint\nforms (form #2131) will be maintained in all special housing areas and will be\ngiven to inmates requesting them. The area supervisor is responsible for\nensuring that a supply of these forms is available at all times. Additional\nforms, when needed, will be obtained from the IGP supervisor's\noffice. (2)\n\nEnvelopes will be given\nto inmates for use in forwarding their completed grievance forms to the IGP\noffice. The sealed envelopes will assure the confidentiality of the inmate's\ncomplaint while enroute to the IGP office. (3)\n\nArea supervisors will ensure that the\ncompleted grievance forms are placed in sealed envelopes, collected and\nforwarded to the IGP office. (b) IGP deposit boxes. Where available, SHU\ninmates shall use centrally located IGP deposit boxes to send grievance forms\nand IGP correspondence to the IGP office. These boxes shall be kept locked at\nall times. The IGP supervisor and staff representatives (IGRC sergeant/\nofficer) will have the only keys to these boxes and will collect their contents\nat least two times per week. Broken boxes or locks will be reported to the IGP\nsupervisor immediately, and he or she will arrange for their repair or\nreplacement. In the interim, grievance forms shall be submitted as stated in\nparagraph (a)(3) of this section. (c) Rounds, access to IGP members and\nadvisors. (1)\n\nAn IGRC staff member (sergeant, officer) or grievance supervisor shall make rounds of all special housing areas\nat a reasonable time at least once a week to allow inmates direct access to the\nprogram. These rounds will give inmates who are having communication problems\nor difficulty writing their complaints an opportunity to request and receive\nassistance. Staff noting problems or requests for assistance shall report them\nto the IGP supervisor. The IGP supervisor will work with the deputy\nsuperintendent(s) of programs and/or security to obtain necessary\nassistance. (2)\n\nThe superintendent, at his/her discretion, may grant direct access to the full IGRC, or to either\nan inmate member or a staff member of the IGP office for those inmates in\ncertain special housing areas such as reception or transient units. (3)\n\nSince there is a security interest in\nrestricting confined inmates access to other inmates, the superintendent may\nprohibit any inmate in SHU from using another inmate as an advisor or from\nserving as an advisor to another inmate. Staff members from the IGRC or from\nthe facility at large can serve this function. A staff member must be willing\nto accept this function. (d) Attendance at hearings. A grievant\nconfined to SHU who will be released within 30 calendar days shall be given the\noption of having the hearing held in his/her absence or postponed until release\nfrom confinement. The grievant's decision shall be obtained in writing. If a\ngrievant is not scheduled for release from confinement within 30 calendar days, the hearing shall be held in his/her absence. (e) Time limits. The time limits for\nprocessing of grievances as delineated in section\n701.6\n(g) of this Part, also apply to grievances submitted from special housing\nunits. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n701.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
