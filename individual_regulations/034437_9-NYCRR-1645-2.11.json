  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-2.11 - Investment ledger\n\nState Regulations\n\nDetailed records shall be kept of all investments made\ndirectly by the local agency in a subsidiary investment ledger. A specimen\nledger sheet which reflects the procedures described in this Part, is appended\nas Exhibit 1 of Appendix S-10. A separate sheet should be maintained for each\nlot, by type of securities, acquired. For example, if $10,000 maturity value\nseries F bonds, and $20,000 series G bonds were acquired on May 1, 1956, separate ledger sheets would be set up for each lot. If $5,000, maturity value, series F bonds were acquired at a later date, a separate ledger sheet would, similarly be set up. The ledger sheets should be segregated by the funds and\neach investment of reserve funds should, further, be marked for the particular\nreserve to which the investment is applicable. The investment ledger should, at\nall times, reflect the current book value of each investment and the sum of the\nbalances should agree with the balances in the general ledger investment\naccounts (1170 group). The investment ledger should also reflect the current\nbalance for interest receivable on investments and the sum of the balances\nshould agree with the general ledger accrued interest account\n(1144). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1645-2.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
