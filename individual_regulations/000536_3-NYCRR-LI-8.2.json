  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 8.2 - Propriety of \"transfer\" charge by mortgagee upon change of mortgagor\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was informed that a mortgage investing\ninstitution had granted a conventional home mortgage loan in 1969 which by its\nterms did not allow the mortgagee to accelerate the mortgage indebtedness or\ndeclare it in default upon sale or transfer of the residence mortgaged. The\nmortgage debt bore the maximum rate permitted by law when made. A sale did\noccur, and the mortgagee attempted to impose a \"transfer fee\" on the assuming\nmortgagor. The department was asked whether in its opinion the charge was\nproper under Part 4 of the general regulations of the Banking Board, which was\napplicable because the loan postdated June 30, 1968. The department responded that on the facts presented it did\nnot see a legal justification for the charge. Since the loan already bore the\nmaximum legal rate in effect at the time it was made, imposing the additional\ncharge would be a usurious practice unless the charge fell within one of the\ncategories set forth in section\n4.3\nof Part 4. Since the purchaser\nof the home assumed the existing mortgage, the department recognized that\ncertain of these categories might be operative, such as legal services and\ndisbursements (section\n4.3\n[b] [5]\n), and\npossible fees and taxes for filing or recording whatever transfer, satisfaction\nor other documents might be necessary (section\n4.3\n[c] and [e]\n). However, the mortgagee should be prepared to itemize and justify these expenses\nand may not charge an undifferentiated aggregate \"transfer fee\". The department\nwas of the view that the foregoing principles would be equally applicable if\nthe purchaser had taken the property subject to the mortgage instead of\nassuming it. It was felt likely, however, that even fewer of the categories in\nsection\n4.3\nwould be operative in a\n\"subject to\" situation. DATED: May 1, 1973\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
