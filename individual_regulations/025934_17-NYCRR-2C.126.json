  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2C.126 - Driveway Entrance Plaques (NYW5-16P, NYW5-17P)\n\nState Regulations\n\nOption: 01 Driveway Entrance (NYW5-16P, NYW5-17P) plaques (see Sign\n\nDrawing SD-W16) may be used to supplement Intersection Warning signs (see\n\nSection\n2C.46\n) where it is necessary to\nwarn of driveway entrances or crossings. Standard: 02 An Intersection Warning sign supplemented with a\n\nDriveway Entrance plaque shall be called a Driveway Entrance assembly. 03 Driveway Entrance plaques shall not be used\nalone. Guidance: 04 Driveway Entrance assemblies should be used only where\nsight distance is critically limited and traffic conflict at the driveway\nlocation would not be expected, or where other conditions require warning for\ntraffic safety. 05 Where a series of two or more similar driveways requires\nwarning, one Driveway Entrance assembly should be used in advance of the first\ndriveway in the series with the appropriate Intersection Warning sign (W2-1, W2-7, or W2- 8). 06 The 24\" x 12\" (one-line) and 24\" x 18\" (two-line)\nplaques should be used to supplement 24\" and 30\" warning signs. The 36\" x 18\"\n(one-line) and 36\" x 24\" (two-line) plaques should be used to supplement 36\"\nand 48\" warning signs. Option: 07 Where appropriate, plural legends (e.g., \"DRIVEWAYS\"\ninstead of \"DRIVEWAY\") may be displayed on the Driveway plaque, and, where the\ndriveways are not all on the same side of the roadway, the W2-1 or W2-7 sign\nmay be used in the Driveway Entrance assembly. Guidance: 08 Driveway Entrance assemblies should not normally be used\nfor public highway intersections. 09 Part-time signs (see Section\n2A.03\n) should be used in Driveway\n\nEntrance assemblies where the associated activity (e.g., a truck entrance or\ncrossing) is periodic. Option: 10 Driveway Entrance assemblies may be used for public\nhighway intersections where such use would be in the public interest, provided\nthat: Other signs which would indicate the presence of the\nintersection are not used; and\n\nThe facility indicated on the Driveway plaque is the\nprimary generator of traffic entering or leaving the roadway at the\nintersection. Standard: 11 A Driveway Entrance assembly shall not be used where a\ndestination sign (see Section\n2D.37\n) identifies the entrance, or\nwhere the entrance is signalized. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2C.126\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
