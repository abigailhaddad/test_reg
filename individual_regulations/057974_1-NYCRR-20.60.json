  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 20.60 - Net pool obligation of handlers\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach handler's net pool obligation for milk received at\neach plant and unit shall be computed separately pursuant to subdivisions (a)\nthrough (d) of this section and then combined into one total to be adjusted by\nany credit applicable pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section to determine\nthe handler's total net pool obligation. (a) Multiply the quantity of milk in each\nclass remaining after the computation pursuant to paragraph (a)(19) of section\n20.45\nof this Part and the\ncorresponding step of subdivision (b) of section\n20.45\nby the applicable class price\nadjusted by the applicable differential pursuant to section\n20.52\nof this Part. (b) For each partial pool plant or partial\npool unit, multiply the quantity of pool milk in each class by the applicable\nclass price adjusted by the applicable differential pursuant to section\n20.52\nof this Part. (c) Deduct, in the case of each plant or unit\nnearer than the 201- to 210-mile zone and add, in the case of each plant or\nunit farther than the 201- to 210- mile zone, the sum obtained by multiplying\nthe quantity of pool milk received from dairy farmers by the differential in\ncolumn B of subdivision (c) of section\n20.52\nof this Part applicable at\nthe plant and the weighted average column B differential computed pursuant to\nsubdivision (d) of section\n20.52\napplicable to the\nunit. (d) Add the amounts computed\nin paragraphs (1) through (4) of this subdivision: (1)\n\nMultiply the pounds of overage deducted\nfrom each class pursuant to paragraph (a)(19) of section\n20.45\nof this Part and the\ncorresponding step of subdivision (b) of section\n20.45\nby the applicable class price\nadjusted by the differentials pursuant to sections 20.52 and\n20.81\nof this Part. (2)\n\nMultiply the pounds of skim milk and\nbutterfat in receipts of nonfluid milk products subtracted from Class I-A\npursuant to section\n20.45\n(a)(8)(i)\nof\nthis Part and the corresponding step of section\n20.45\n(b) of this\n\nPart and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat specified in section\n20.44\n(d)(3)(vii)\nof this Part by the difference between the Class I-A and Class III prices, each\nadjusted by the applicable differential pursuant to section\n20.52\nof this Part. (3)\n\nMultiply the pounds of skim milk and\nbutterfat in receipts of nonfluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to\nsection\n20.40\n(c) of this\n\nPart by the difference between the Class I price less $1 (but not to be less\nthan the Class III price) and the Class III price, both adjusted by the\napplicable differential pursuant to section\n20.52\nof this Part. Alternatively, the handler may, with respect to such receipts of nonfluid milk products\nprocessed from producer milk regulated under another Federal order, elect to\nmake payment to the producer-settlement fund of the other order at the\ndifference between the Class I price applicable under the other order at the\nlocation of the plant where the nonfluid milk products were processed (but not\nto be less than the Class III price) and the Class III price. This payment\noption shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the plant\nthat processed the nonfluid milk products is regulated under or more Federal\norders and payment may only be made to the producer-settlement fund of the\norder pricing a plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid milk\nproducts. This payment option shall not apply if the source of the nonfluid\nmilk products used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be determined by\nthe market administrator. (4)\n\nMultiply the quantity of skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated\nfluid milk products from plants other than those defined in section\n20.8\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Part or as a producer-handler and which are assigned to Class I pursuant\nto section\n20.40\n(c) of this\n\nPart or which are subtracted from Class I-A pursuant to section\n20.45\n(a)(8)(i)\nof\nthis Part and the corresponding step of section\n20.45\n(b) of this\n\nPart by the Class I price, adjusted by the applicable differential pursuant to\nsection\n20.52\nof this Part. (5)\n\nMultiply the producer-handler price\ndifferential by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I-A\npursuant to subparagraph (a)(7)(ii) of section\n20.45\nof this Part and the\ncorresponding step of subdivision (b) of section\n20.45\nof this Part. (6)\n\nMultiply the difference between the Class\nIII price for the preceding month and the Class I-A price or the Class II\nprice, as the case may be, for the current month, both applicable at the\nlocation of the nearest plant or unit from which an equivalent quantity of\n\nClass III milk was received in the preceding month, by the pounds of skim milk\nand butterfat subtracted from Class I-A and Class II pursuant to paragraph\n(a)(10) of section\n20.45\nof this Part and the\ncorresponding step of subdivision (b) of section\n20.45\nof this Part. (e) For pool plants that transfer\nbulk concentrated fluid milk products to other pool plants and other order\nplants, add or subtract the amount per hundredweight of any class price change\nfrom the previous month that results from any inventory reclassification of\nbulk concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. Any\nsuch applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant that used the\nconcentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid milk products were\nmade from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products received at the plant during\nthe prior month. (f) Deduct any\ncredit applicable pursuant to section\n20.55\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
