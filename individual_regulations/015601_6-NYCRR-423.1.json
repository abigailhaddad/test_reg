(b) A person who has filed\napplications for more than one mine may furnish a blanket bond for the total\namount of the financial obligation in lieu of individual bonds for each mine\nlocation.

This cost and the corresponding amount of the bond shall be determined\nby the department on the basis of an evaluation of the following factors: the\ntype of mine; the number of acres of affected land; the geographic location of\nthe mine; the proposed land-use objective and basic reclamation requirements; the length of the permit period; the proposed method and schedule of\nreclamation; and other criteria which may be considered relevant to the\nestimate. The bond shall be maintained for a period of two years after\ncompletion of reclamation as provided in section\n423.3\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (d) In lieu of the bond, the\napplicant may deposit cash or certified check, negotiable bonds of the United\n\nStates government, United States treasury notes, United States treasury\ncertificates of indebtedness, United States treasury bills, bonds or notes of\nthe State of New York, bonds of any political subdivision in the State of New\n\nYork, bonds of the New York State Housing Finance Agency or of other New York\n\nState agencies or authorities, or bonds of public corporations of the State of\n\nNew York, an irrevocable bank letter of credit, a certificate of deposit, or\nother forms of financial security acceptable to the department. Acceptable\nsubstitutes, if furnished, shall be kept on deposit with the department for the\nduration of the bond period. (e) If, in case of default, the amount of the bond established by the department is\nnot sufficient to cover the cost of reclaiming the affected land, the permittee\nshall be liable for the full additional costs. These additional funds shall be\nobtained by agreement with the permittee or, if necessary, by placing a lien on\nany or all materials, machinery, implements and tools of every description\nwhich may be found at the mine, or on other assets of the permittee.
