(f) Accountability\nsystem for schools and districts. (1)\n\nAccountability system for elementary and middle schools. (i) Elementary/Middle Schools identified for\nCSI. Every three years, beginning with the 2025-2026 school year based on\n2024-2025 school year results, a n elementary/middle school shall be\npreliminarily identified for CSI using the following decision table, which\ncombines the following measures of student performance for all students in the\nschool: (1)\n\nWeighted Average\n\nAchievement; (2)\n\nCore Subject\n\nPerformance; (3)\n\nStudent\n\nGrowth; (4)\n\nEnglish Language\n\nProficiency; and\n(5)\n\nAttendance. A\nschool shall be preliminarily identified for CSI if it meets scenario 1 or 2 of\nthe decision table below. If scenarios 1 and 2 do not identify a minimum of\nfive percent of the lowest performing Title 1 schools, scenario 3 will be\napplied. Provided that in order to be preliminarily identified using the\ndecision table below, a performance level must be assigned at a minimum to the\n\nWeighted Average Achievement measure and Core Subject Performance measure, and\none or more of the following measures: English Language Proficiency, Student\n\nGrowth, and/or Attendance. Decision Table for Identification of\n\nElementary/Middle Schools for Comprehensive Support and\n\nImprovement\n\nScenarios\n\nWeighted Average Achievement\n\nLevel\n\nCore Subject Performance\n\nLevel\n\nStudent Growth\n\nLevel\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency\n\nLevel\n\nAttendance\n\nLevel\n1\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nAt Least One Level 1\n2\n\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 1 or 2\n\nLevel 1 or 2\nor None*\nor None*\n3\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 2\n\nEither Level 2\n*None means there were not enough student results to meet\nthe minimum n - size requirement. (a) Weighted Average Achievement Level. For each public elementary/middle school\nwhose all students group meets the minimum n-size requirements as defined in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall\ncompute a Weighted Average Achievement Level using the results of ELA and\nmathematics assessments in grades 3-8 and science assessments for grades 5 and\n8 with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall first determine an ELA and a Mathematics Achievement Index\nfor each public school in the State. The ELA and the Math Achievement Index is\na number between 0-250 that is computed separately for ELA and math for a\nsubgroup by summing the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at\n\nLevel 2, plus the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level\n3 multiplied by 2, plus the number of continuously enrolled students who scored\nat Level 4 multiplied by 2.5 (numerator) and dividing this result by the\ngreater of the number of continuously enrolled students in the subgroup with\nvalid test scores or 95% of continuously enrolled students (denominator). The\nresult of this division is then multiplied by 100. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine a\n\nScience Achievement Index for each public school in the State. The Science\n\nAchievement Index is a number between 0-250 that is computed for Science for a\nsubgroup by summing the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at\n\nLevel 2, plus the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level\n3 multiplied by 2, plus the number of continuously enrolled students who scored\nat Level 4 multiplied by 2.5 (numerator), and dividing this result by the\ngreater of the number of continuously enrolled students in the subgroup with\nvalid test scores or 95% of continuously enrolled students (denominator). The\nresult of this division is then multiplied by 100. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then compute the\n\nWeighted Average Achievement Index, which is a number between 0-250 that is\ncomputed as the weighted average of the ELA, Mathematics, and Science\nachievement indices. (4)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then rank order schools based on their performance on the\n\nWeighted Average Achievement Index. (5)\n\nEach elementary/middle school will then\nbe assigned a Weighted Average Achievement Level from 1-4 based on such rank\nordering using the table below: Weighted Average Achievement\n\nRank\n\nWeighted Average Achievement\n\nLevel\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(6)\n\nThe resulting Weighted Average Achievement Level is then used in the table\ndescribed in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision as one of\nthe multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school shall be\npreliminarily identified for CSI. (b) Core Subject Performance Level. For each\npublic elementary/middle school whose all students group meets the minimum\nn-size requirements as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this\nsection, a Core Subject Performance Level using the results of ELA and\nmathematics assessments in grades 3-8 and science assessments in grades 5 and 8\nshall be computed by the Commissioner in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall first calculate a\n\nPerformance Index separately for ELA, mathematics, and science, using the\nfollowing formula for each subject: (i) The\nsum of the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level 2, plus\nthe number of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level 3 multiplied\nby 2, plus the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level 4\nmultiplied by 2.5 (numerator), divided by the number of valid test results for\ncontinuously enrolled students in ELA, mathematics, and science (denominator). The result of this division is then multiplied by 100 to determine the Index. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner\nshall then compute the Core Subject Performance Index, which is a number from\n0-250 that is computed by summing for elementary/middle-level ELA, mathematics, and science, the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level\n2, plus the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level 3\nmultiplied by 2, plus the number of continuously enrolled students who scored\nat Level 4 multiplied by 2.5 (numerator), and dividing the result by the number\nof valid test results for continuously enrolled students in ELA, mathematics, and science (denominator). The result of this division is then multiplied by\n100 to determine the Index. (3)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall establish static cut points every three years beginning with\n2023-2024 school year results based on ranked outcomes of the Core Subject\n\nPerformance Index. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, if\nthere are extraordinary or extenuating circumstances such as interrupted\nlearning, new assessments, or cancellation of examinations that impact student\noutcomes, the Commissioner will average three years of assessment data to\nestablish the static cut points. (4)\n\nEach elementary/middle school will then\nbe assigned a Core Subject Performance Level 1-4 based on static cut points\nestablished by ranked outcomes every three years beginning with 2023-2024\nschool year results as indicated in the table below: Core Subject Performance Index\n\nRank\n\nCore Subject Performance\n\nLevel\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(5)\n\nThe resulting Core Subject Performance Achievement Level is then used in the\ntable described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision as one\nof the multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school shall\nbe preliminarily identified for CSI. (c) Student Growth Level. For each public\nelementary/middle school whose all students group meets the minimum n-size\nrequirements as defined in subdivision (b)(1) of this section, a Student Growth\n\nLevel will be determined in accordance with the following steps: (1)\nA mean growth percentile for the all\nstudents group in each school shall be calculated by adding the student growth\npercentile scores for continuously enrolled students in grades 4-8 ELA to the\nstudent growth percentile scores for continuously enrolled students in grades\n4-8 math in the current year, and dividing the result by the total number of\nstudent growth percentile scores in those grades/subjects; (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then create a rank\nordered list of school performance based on the school's Mean Growth Percentile\nscore. (3)\nA Student Growth Level\nfrom 1-4 shall then be assigned to each school using the table below: Mean Growth Percentile\n\nStudent Growth Level\n45 or less\n1\n45.1 to 50\n2\n50.1 to 54\n3\n\nGreater than 54\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting Student Growth Level is then used in the table described in\nparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of student\nperformance to determine whether the school is preliminarily identified for\nCSI. (d) English Language\n\nProficiency Level. For each public elementary/middle school meeting the minimum\nn-size requirements as defined in subdivision (b)(1) of this section, the\n\nCommissioner shall compute an English Language Proficiency Level in accordance\nwith the following steps: (1)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall first determine an initial level of proficiency and the\ncorresponding years that the student was identified as an English Language\n\nLearner based upon the student's performance on the NYSESLAT in the initial\nyear of identification as an English Language Learner pursuant to Part 154 of\nthis Title. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner\nshall then determine progress rates for each student based on the years that\nthe student has been identified as an English language learner and the level\nachieved on the NYSESLAT in the first year in which the student was identified\nas an English Language Learner pursuant to Part 154 of this Title. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then calculate\neach school's success ratio based on all continuously enrolled students'\nresults compared to continuously enrolled students' progress rates, as\ndetermined by the Commissioner. Utilizing this information, each school shall\nthen be assigned an English Language Proficiency Level from 1-4 in accordance\nwith the following table: Success Ratio\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency\n\nLevel\n0-0.49\n1\n0.50-0.99\n2\n1.0-1.24\n3\n1.25+\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting English Language Proficiency Level is then used in the table\ndescribed in paragraph (1)(i) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures\nof performance to determine whether the school shall be preliminarily\nidentified for CSI. (e) Attendance Level. For each public elementary/middle school meeting the minimum\nn-size requirement pursuant to subdivision (b)(1) (xvi) of this section, the\n\nCommissioner shall compute an Attendance Level in accordance with the following\nsteps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall first\nassign Attendance Rate Levels from 1 to 4 to the attendance rate for each\nstudent enrolled for a minimum of 30 cumulative instructional days and in\nattendance at least one of those days. Excused and unexcused absences are\ncounted as absences. Suspensions are not counted as excused or unexcused\nabsences, as suspended students are required to be provided with instruction\nwhile they are suspended. At the elementary/middle level, Attendance is\ncalculated for grades 1-8 and ungraded age equivalent students. The Attendance\n\nRate Level will be based on the percentage of instructional days attended in\naccordance with the following table: % Instructional Days\n\nAttended\n\nAttendance Rate\n\nLevel\n85% or less\n1\n85.1 to 90%\n2\n90.1 to 95%\n3\n\nGreater than 95%\n4\n(2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then use student Attendance Rate Levels to calculate an\n\nAttendance Index for each subgroup in accordance with the following formula: (i) The sum of the number of students\nenrolled for 30 cumulative days and in attendance at least one of those days\nwho scored at Level 2, plus the number who scored at Level 3 multiplied by 2, plus the number who scored at Level 4 multiplied by 2.5 (numerator), divided by\nthe number of students enrolled for at least 30 cumulative instructional days\nand in attendance at least one of those days as defined in paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section (denominator). The result of the division is\nthen multiplied by 100. The result will establish an Attendance\n\nIndex. (3)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then assign an overall Attendance Level from 1-4 based on\nthe calculated Attendance Index using static cut points. The static cut points\nwill be established every three years beginning with the 2023-2024 school year\nresults based on ranked distribution as indicated in the following table: Attendance Index\n\nRank\n\nAttendance\n\nLevel\n10% or less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting Attendance Level is then used in the table described in\nsubparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision as one of multiple\nmeasures of performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily\nidentified for CSI. (f) For feeder schools: The Weighted Average Achievement Index and Level and the\n\nCore Subject Performance Index and Level of public schools and school districts\nserving grades 1 and/or 2, but not grade 3 or higher (hereafter referred to as\n\"feeder schools\"), will be determined using backmapping. In school districts\nwith such feeder schools, the grade 3 State assessment results for each feeder\nschool student will be attributed to the feeder school as well as to the school\nin which the student took the assessment. The student's results will be\nattributed to a feeder school only if the student was continuously enrolled in\nthe feeder school from BEDS day until June 1 of the school year in the highest\ngrade served by the feeder school. (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of this\nparagraph, for any measures of student performance, if the all students group\ndoes not meet the minimum n-size, as defined by subdivision (b)(1) of this\nsection, for the minimum number of measures as defined by subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph, the school shall be identified using the selfassessment\nprocess, as described in subdivision (b)(1) of this section. (ii)\n\nElementary/Middle Schools identified for Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI). An elementary/middle school shall be preliminarily identified for TSI if the\nschool meets the criteria for identification outlined in the table below for\nthree consecutive school years for the same accountability subgroup. (a) The decision table below combines\nmultiple measures of performance for accountability subgroups in the school\nusing the same methodology used to identify for CSI pursuant to subparagraph\n(i) of this paragraph and using the following accountability measures: (1)\n\nWeighted Average Achievement; (2)\n\nCore Subject Performance; (3)\n\nStudent Growth; (4)\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency; and\n(5)\n\nAttendance. (b) The identifications for TSI\nshall be based on the performance of accountability subgroups, as defined in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, and shall not include the\nperformance of the all students group; provided that, in order to be\npreliminarily identified using scenario 1 or 2 of the decision table below, a\nperformance level must be assigned to, at a minimum, the Weighted Average\n\nAchievement measure and Core Subject Performance measure and one or more of the\nfollowing measures: English Language Proficiency, Student Growth, and/or\n\nAttendance. Decision Table for Identification of\n\nElementary/Middle Schools for Targeted Support and Improvement\n\nScenarios\n\nWeightedAverage Achievement\n\nCore Subject\n\nPerformance\n\nStudent Growth\n\nEnglish\n\nLanguageProficiency\n\nAttendance\n1\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nAt Least One Level 1\n2\n\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 1 or 2\nor None*\nLevel 1 or 2\nor None*\n*None means there were not enough student results to meet\nthe minimum n-size requirement. (c) If a school meets the identification\ncriteria for CSI, ATSI, and TSI in an identification year in which schools are\nidentified for CSI, the school shall be identified for CSI; provided however\nthat if a school identified for CSI is removed from CSI identification and such\nschool meets the criteria for ATSI, the school shall be identified for ATSI. If\nthe school does not meet the identification criteria for CSI and ATSI, but one\nor more subgroups either meets the identification criteria for TSI or do not\nmeet the exit criteria for TSI, the school shall be identified for\nTSI. (d) If a school meets the\nidentification criteria for both CSI and TSI in an identification year in which\nschools are identified for CSI, the school shall be identified for CSI; provided, however, that if a school identified for CSI is removed from CSI\nidentification but one or more subgroups either meets the identification\ncriteria for TSI or does not meet the exit criteria for TSI, the school shall\nbe identified for TSI. (e) If a\nschool meets the identification criteria for both ATSI and TSI, the school\nshall be identified for ATSI; provided, however, that if a school identified\nfor ATSI is removed from ATSI identification and one or more subgroups either\nmeets the identification criteria for TSI or does not meet the exit criteria\nfor TSI, the school shall be identified for TSI. (f) When the Commissioner creates a\nrank-ordered list for the racial/ethnic subgroup(s) for purposes of\nidentification for TSI, one rank-ordered list will be generated for all\nracial/ethnic groups combined. (iii)\n\nElementary/Middle Schools identified\nfor ATSI. (a) Beginning with the 2018 - 2019\nschool year, for each year in which the Commissioner identifies schools for CSI\nbased on the performance of the all students group in accordance with\nsubparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) of this section, the\n\nCommissioner shall identify for ATSI any school identified for TSI with a\nsubgroup whose performance would have caused the school to be identified for\nCSI using the methods for identification specified in subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (b) For schools with\nsubgroups identified for ATSI for three consecutive years whose performance\ncauses the school to be identified for CSI using the methods for identification\nspecified in subdivision (f) of this section, the Commissioner shall identify\nsuch schools for CSI in each year in which the Commissioner identifies schools\nfor CSI in accordance with subparagraph (f)(1)(i) of this section. (2)\n\nAccountability\nsystem for high schools. (i) High Schools\nidentified for CSI. Every three years, beginning with the 2025-2026 school\nyears based on 2024-2025 school year results, a high school shall be\npreliminarily identified for CSI using the following decision table, which\ncombines the following measures of student performance for all students in the\nschool: (1)\n\nWeighted Average\n\nAchievement; (2)\n\nCore Subject\n\nPerformance; (3)\n\nGraduation\n\nRate; (4)\n\nEnglish Language\n\nProficiency; (5)\n\nAttendance; and\n(6)\n\nCollege, Career, and Civic\n\nReadiness; provided that in order to be preliminarily identified using the\ndecision table below a performance level must be assigned to, at a minimum, the\n\nWeighted Average Achievement, either Core Subject Performance or Graduation\n\nRate, and one or more of the following measures: English Language Proficiency; Attendance; or College, Career, and Civic Readiness (\"CCCR\"). A school shall be\npreliminarily identified for CSI if it meets scenario 1 or 2 of the decision\ntable below. If scenarios 1 and 2 do not identify a minimum five percent of the\nlowest performing of Title 1 schools, scenario 3 will be applied. Provided, however, that notwithstanding the table below, beginning with 2017-2018 school\nyear graduation results, any public high school with a Four-Year Graduation\n\nRate below 67 percent and a Five-Year or Six-Year Graduation Rate that is not\nat or above 67 percent will be preliminarily identified for CSI. Decision Table for Identification of High Schools for\n\nComprehensive Support and Improvement\n\nScenarios\n\nWeighted Average\n\nAchievement\n\nCore Subject\n\nPerformance\n\nGraduation\n\nRate\n\nEnglish Language\n\nProficiency\n\nAttendance\nCCCR\n1\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nLevel 1\n\nAt Least One Level 1\n2\n\nLevel 1 or 2\n\nEither Level 1\n\nAt Least One Level 1\n3\n\nLevel 1 or 2\n\nEither Level 1\n\nLevel 1 or 2 or None*\nLevel 1 or 2\n*None means there were not enough student results to meet\nthe minimum n-size requirement. (a) Weighted Average Achievement Level. For each public high school whose all\nstudents group (xi) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section,] meets\nthe minimum n-size requirements as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b)\nof this section, the Commissioner shall compute a Weighted Average Achievement\n\nLevel using the results of the ELA, mathematics, science, and social studies\nassessments for the Accountability Cohort with the following steps: (1)\nthe commissioner shall first calculate a\nperformance index separately for ELA, mathematics, science, and social studies\nat the secondary level using the following formula for each subject: (i) the sum of the ELA performance index\nmultiplied by three, plus the result of the mathematics performance index\nmultiplied by three, plus the result of the science performance index\nmultiplied by two, plus the result of the social studies performance Index\nmultiplied by one, divided by the sum of the multipliers used to make this\ncalculation; (2)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then combine the Performance Indices for ELA, mathematics, science, and social studies to calculate a Weighted Average Achievement Index\nin accordance with the following formula: (i) The sum of the ELA Performance Index multiplied by three, plus the result of\nthe Mathematics Performance Index multiplied by three, plus the result of the\n\nScience Performance Index multiplied by two, plus the result of the Social\n\nStudies Performance Index multiplied by two, divided by the sum of the\nmultipliers used to make this calculation. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then rank order\nschools based on their Weighted Average Achievement Index in accordance with\nsubclause (2) of this clause. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign a Weighted Average Achievement Level for all\nschools based on the rank ordering described in subclause (3) of this clause\nusing the table below: Weighted Average Achievement\n\nRank\n\nWeighted Average Achievement\n\nLevel\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(5)\n\nThe resulting Weighted Average Achievement Level is then used in the table\ndescribed in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision as one of\nmultiple measures of performance to determine whether the school shall be\npreliminarily identified for CSI. (b) Core Subject Performance Level. For each\npublic high school whose all students group meets the minimum n-size\nrequirement as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the\n\nCommissioner shall compute a Core Subject Performance Level using the results\nof ELA, mathematics, science, and social studies assessments in accordance with\nthe following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner\nshall first calculate a Performance Index separately for ELA, mathematics, science, and social studies at the secondary level using the following formula\nfor each subject: (i) The sum of the number\nof tested students in the Accountability Cohort who scored at Level 2, plus the\nnumber who scored at Level 3 multiplied by 2, plus the number who scored at\n\nLevel 4 multiplied by 2.5 (numerator), divided by the number of tested students\nin the Accountability Cohort as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of\nthis section (denominator). The result of this division is then multiplied by\n100 to establish the Performance Index for each subject\narea. (2)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then calculate the weighted average of the Performance\n\nIndices for ELA, mathematics, science, and social studies to calculate a Core\n\nSubject Performance Index in accordance with the following formula: (i) The sum of the ELA Performance Index\nmultiplied by three, plus the result of the Mathematics Performance Index\nmultiplied by three, plus the result of the Science Performance Index\nmultiplied by two, plus the result of the Social Studies Performance Index\nmultiplied by two, divided by the sum of the multipliers used to make this\ncalculation. (3)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then establish static cut points every three years, starting\nwith 2023-2024 school year results, based on ranked outcomes of the Core\n\nSubject Performance Indices in accordance with subclause (2) of this clause, except that upon a finding of extenuating or extraordinary circumstances, the\n\nCommissioner may average up to three years of the level cut points for all\naccountability subgroups to establish static cut points. Notwithstanding any\nother provisions of this section, if there are extraordinary or extenuating\ncircumstances such as interrupted learning, new assessments, or cancellation of\nexaminations that impact student outcomes, the Commissioner will average three\nyears of assessment data to establish the static cut points. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign a Core\n\nSubject Performance Level for all schools based on the rank-based static cut\npoints described in subclause (3) of this clause using the table below: Core Subject Performance Index\n\nRank\n\nCore Subject Performance\n\nLevel\n10% or less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(5)\n\nThe resulting Core Subject Performance Level is then used in the table\ndescribed in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision as one of\nthe multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school shall be\npreliminarily identified for CSI. (c) Graduation rate level. For each public\nhigh school meeting the minimum n size requirement pursuant to paragraph (b)(1)\nof this section, the commissioner shall compute a graduation rate level for the\nfour-year, five-year, and six-year graduation rate, as applicable in accordance\nwith the following steps: (1)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall first calculate the unweighted average of the Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation Rates. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall also create a\n\nGraduation Rate rank order list by rank ordering schools based on the\nunweighted average of the Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation\n\nRate. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall\nthen assign a Graduation Rate Level from 1 to 4 based on the rank ordering\ndescribed in subclause (2) of this clause using the table below: Graduation Rate Rank\n\nGraduation Rate Level\n10% or less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting Graduation Rate Level is then used in the table described in\nsubparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision as one of multiple\nmeasures of performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily\nidentified for CSI. (5)\n\nProvided, however, that notwithstanding the table above, any public high school with a\ngraduation rate of 67 percent or below on the Four-Year Graduation Rate cohort\nthat does not have a Five-Year or Six-Year Graduation Rate Cohort at or above\n67 percent shall be preliminarily identified for CSI. (d) English language proficiency level. For\neach public high school meeting the minimum n size requirements as defined in\nparagraph (b)(1) of this section, the commissioner shall compute an English\nlanguage proficiency level in accordance with the following steps: (1). the commissioner shall first determine\nan initial level of proficiency and the corresponding years that the student\nwas identified as an English language learner based upon the student's\nperformance on the NYSESLAT in the initial year of identification as an English\nlanguage learner pursuant to Part 154 of this Title; (2). the commissioner shall then determine\nprogress rates for each student based on the years identified as an English\nlanguage learner and the level achieved on the NYSESLAT in the first year in\nwhich the student was identified as an English language learner pursuant to\n\nPart 154 of this Title; (3). the\ncommissioner shall then calculate each school's success ratio based on all\ncontinuously enrolled students' results compared to the continuously enrolled\nstudents' progress rates, as determined by the commissioner. Utilizing this\ninformation, each school shall then be assigned an English language proficiency\nlevel from 1-4 in accordance with the following table: Success Ratio\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency\n\nLevel\n0 - 0.49\n1\n0.50 - 0.99\n2\n1.0 - 1.24\n3\n1.25+\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting English Language Proficiency Level is then used in the table\ndescribed in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision as one of\nmultiple measures of performance to determine whether the school shall be\npreliminarily identified for CSI. (e) Attendance Level. For each public high\nschool meeting the minimum n-size requirement pursuant to paragraph (1) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute an Attendance\n\nLevel in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall first assign\n\nAttendance Rate Levels from 1 to 4 to the attendance rate for each student\nenrolled for a minimum of 30 cumulative instructional days and in attendance at\nleast one of those days. Excused and unexcused absences are counted as\nabsences. Suspensions are not counted as excused or unexcused absences, as\nsuspended students are required to be provided with instruction while they are\nsuspended. At the high school level, Attendance is calculated for grades 9 -12\nand ungraded age equivalent students. The Attendance Rate Level will be\ndetermined in accordance with the following table: % Instructional Days\n\nAttended\n\nAttendance Rate\n\nLevel\n85% or less\n1\n85.1 to 90%\n2\n90.1 to 95%\n3\n\nGreater than 95%\n4\n(2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then use student Attendance Rate Levels to calculate an\n\nAttendance Index for each subgroup in accordance with the following formula: (i) The sum of the number of students\nenrolled for 30 cumulative days and in attendance at least one of those days\nwho scored at Level 2, plus the number who scored at Level 3 multiplied by 2, plus the number who scored at Level 4 multiplied by 2.5 (numerator), divided by\nthe number of students enrolled for at least 30 cumulative instructional days\nand in attendance at least one of those days as defined in paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (b) of this section (denominator). The result of the division is\nthen multiplied by 100. The result will establish an Attendance\n\nIndex. (3)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then assign an overall Attendance Level from 1-4 based on\nthe calculated Attendance Index using rank-based static cut points. The\nrank-based static cut points will be established every three years beginning\nwith the 2023-2024 school year results based on a ranked distribution as\nindicated in the following table: Attendance Rank\n\nAttendance Level\n10% or less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting Attendance Level is then used in the table described in\nsubparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision as one of multiple\nmeasures of performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily\nidentified for CSI. (f) For feeder schools: the weighted average achievement index and level, the core\nsubject performance index and level, the composite performance index and level, and the academic progress level of public schools, school districts, and\ncharter schools serving grades 1 and/or 2, but not grade 3 or higher (hereafter\nreferred to as feeder schools) will be determined using backmapping. In school\ndistricts with such feeder schools and in school districts that accept grade 3\nstudents from feeder schools in other school districts by contract, the grade 3\n\nState assessment results for each feeder school student will be attributed to\nthe feeder school as well as to the school in which the student took the\nassessment. The student's results will be attributed to a feeder school only if\nthe student was continuously enrolled in the feeder school from BEDS day until\nthe end of the school year in the highest grade served by the feeder school. For feeder schools, the combined composite performance and growth level will be\ndetermined using the elementary/middle-level ELA and math composite performance\nlevel only. (1)\n\nThe Index is calculated using\nthe number of students in the Four-Year Graduation Rate Cohort as of June 30 of\nthe reporting year plus any students not in the graduation rate cohort who earn\na Regents Diploma with a Seal of Biliteracy as the denominator. (2)\n\nThe numerator is the number of these\nstudents demonstrating success on specific college, career, and civic readiness\nmeasures multiplied by the weighting (0.5 to 2.0) assigned to each of these\nmeasures in accordance with the table below plus the number of students who\nearned a High School Equivalency diploma in the current reporting year or one\nof the previous two reporting years and did not have the High School\n\nEquivalency diploma count towards the College, Career, and Civic Readiness\nindex in a previous year, and students who earned a Regents Diploma with a Seal\nof Biliteracy in the reporting year, regardless of whether or not they were in\nthe Four-Year Graduation Rate Cohort. In accordance with the provisions of Section\n100.5\nof this Part: Regents Diploma with Advanced Designation, Regents or Local Diploma with CTE Endorsement, Cohort Regents Diploma with Seal\nof Biliteracy, Annual Regents Diploma with Seal of Biliteracy, Regents Diploma\nand score of 3 or higher on an Advanced Placement exam, Regents Diploma and\nscore of 4 or higher on an International Baccalaureate exam, P-Tech and Regents\n\nDiploma Requirements, Regents Diploma with Smart Scholars, Regents Diploma with\n\nSmart Transfer Early College, Regents Diploma with Seal of Civic Readiness, Regents Diploma and high school credit earned through participation in dual\nenrollment (in high school and accredited college) course, Skills and\nachievement commencement credential as provided in section\n100.6\n(a) of this\n\nPart and a Level 4 on the NYSAA in ELA, mathematics, and science for students\nwith disabilities as defined in section\n100.1\n(t)(2)\nof\nthis Part\n2.0\n\nRegents Diploma and high school credit earned\nthrough participation in an Advanced Placement course, Regents Diploma and high\nschool credit earned through participation in an International Baccalaureate\ncourse, Regents Diploma with Career Development and Occupational Studies (CDOS)\nendorsement, Skills and achievement commencement credential as provided in\nsection\n100.6\n(a) of this\n\nPart and Level 3 on the NYSAA for students in ELA, mathematics, and science\nwith disabilities as defined in section\n100.1\n(t)(2)\nof\nthis Part\n1.5\n\nRegents or Local Diploma only in accordance with\nprovisions of section\n100.5\nof this Part, Skills and\nachievement commencement credential as provided in section\n100.6\n(a) of this\n\nPart, and an achievement Level 2 on the NYSAA in ELA, mathematics, and\nscience\n1.0\n\nAnnual high school equivalency diploma recipients\n(included in the numerator but not denominator), New York State career\ndevelopment and occupational studies commencement credential as provided in\nsection\n100.6\n(b) of this\n\nPart\n0.5\n\nNo high school diploma or high school equivalency\ndiploma\n0\n\nTo determine the College, Career, and Civic Readiness\n\nIndex, the numerator is divided by the denominator, and the result is\nmultiplied by 100. (3)\n\nThe\n\nCommissioner shall then assign a College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level\nfrom 1 to 4 based on the ranking of the Index described in subclause (1) of\nthis clause using the table below: College, Career, and Civic\n\nReadiness Rank\n\nCollege, Career, and Civic\n\nReadiness Level\n10% or less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level is then used in the\ntable described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision as one\nof multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school is\npreliminarily identified for CSI. (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of this\nparagraph, for any measures of student performance, if the all students group\ndoes not meet the minimum n-size, as defined by subdivision (b)(1) of this\nsection, for the minimum number of measures as defined by subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph, the school shall be identified using the selfassessment\nprocess, as described in subdivision (b)(1) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nHigh Schools identified for Targeted Support and Improvement. A high school\nshall be preliminarily identified for TSI if the school meets the criteria for\nidentification outlined in the table below for three consecutive school years\nfor the same accountability subgroup, except that a school identified as a\n\nPriority or Focus School during 2017-2018 school year may be identified, using\n2017-2018 school year data only, if such school meets the criteria for\nidentification for TSI beginning with the 2018-2019 school year. (a) The decision table below combines\nmultiple measures for accountability subgroups in the school using the same\nmethodology used to identify schools for CSI pursuant to subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph and using the following accountability measures: (1)\n\nWeighted Average Achievement; (2)\n\nCore Subject Performance; (3)\n\nGraduation Rate; (4)\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency; (5)\n\nAttendance; and\n(6)\n\nCollege, Career, and Civic\n\nReadiness. (b) Schools\nidentified for TSI shall be based on the performance of accountability\nsubgroups, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, and\nshall not include the performance of the all students group; provided that in\norder to be preliminarily identified using the decision table below a\nperformance level must be assigned to, at a minimum, the Weighted Average\n\nAchievement, either Core Subject Performance or Graduation Rate, and one or\nmore of the following measures: English Language Proficiency; Attendance; and/or College, Career, and Civic Readiness.

(d) When the Commissioner\ncreates a rank-ordered list for the racial/ethnic subgroup (s) for purposes of\nidentification for TSI, one rank-ordered list will be generated for all\nracial/ethnic groups combined. (iii)\n\nHigh Schools identified for ATSI. (a) Beginning with the 2018-2019 school year, for each year in which the Commissioner identifies schools for CSI based on the\nperformance of the all students group in accordance with subparagraph (i) of\nparagraph (2) of subdivision (f) of this section, the Commissioner shall\nidentify for ATSI any high school identified for TSI with a subgroup whose\nperformance would have caused the school to be identified for CSI using the\nmethods for identification specified in subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (b) For schools with a\nsubgroup identified for ATSI for three consecutive years whose performance\nmeets the criteria to be identified for CSI using the methods for\nidentification specified in subdivision (f) of this section, the Commissioner\nshall identify such school for CSI for the subgroup in each year in which the\n\nCommissioner identifies schools for CSI in accordance with subparagraph (i) of\nparagraph (2) of subdivision (f) of this section. (3)\n\nTarget Districts. (i) Any school district with one or more\n\nSchools identified for CSI, ATSI, or TSI pursuant to the provisions of this\nsection shall be identified as a Target District. (g) For each school\npreliminarily identified for TSI, ATSI, or CSI and for each school district\npreliminarily identified as a Target District pursuant to subdivision (f) of\nthis section, the school district or charter school shall be allowed to present\nto the Commissioner additional data and/or any relevant information concerning\nextenuating or extraordinary circumstances faced by the school or district that\nshould be cause for the Commissioner not to identify the school for CSI, ATSI, or TSI or the district as a Target District. (h) Public notification of identification for\nCSI, ATSI, or TSI or as a Target District.

(m) Removal of schools\nfrom registration review, school phase-out or closure. (1)\n\nIn the event that a school has\ndemonstrated the progress necessary to be removed from registration review, the\nsuperintendent may petition the Commissioner to remove the school from\nregistration review. (2)\nA school\nshall not be removed from registration review if, in the Commissioner's\njudgment, conditions that may contribute to a poor learning environment, as\nidentified in paragraph (2) of subdivision (k) of this section, remain present\nin the school. (3)\n\nIn the event\nthat a school placed under registration review prior to the 2018-2019 school\nyear demonstrates that it has met its previously established progress targets\npursuant to paragraph (p) of section\n100.2\nor section\n100.18\nof this Part, but is\nidentified in the 2018-2019 school year for CSI pursuant to this section, the\nschool shall remain under registration review and shall follow the intervention\nrequirements pursuant to subdivision (i) of this section and meet the targets\nfor removal from the CSI support model pursuant to subdivision (j) of this\nsection, pursuant to a timeline prescribed by the Commissioner. (4)\n\nIn the event that a school placed under\nregistration review prior to the 2018-2019 school year demonstrates that it has\nmet its previously established progress targets pursuant to paragraph (p) of\nsection\n100.2\nor section 100,19 of this\n\nPart, and is not identified in the 2018-2019 school year for CSI pursuant to\nsubdivision (g) of this section, the school shall be removed from registration\nreview. (5)\n\nIn the event that a\nboard of education either seeks to phase out or close a school under\nregistration review or is required to close or phase out a school pursuant to\nparagraph (l)(3) of this section, the board of education (in New York City, the\nchancellor or chancellor's designee) shall submit for Commissioner's approval, a plan identifying the intervention that will be implemented and will result in\nphase out or closure, in the form and containing such content as prescribed by\nthe Commissioner. The Commissioner will consider the academic impact of such\nphase out or closure on other schools within the school district and may grant\napproval of such plan provided that: (i) official resolutions or other approvals to phase out or close the existing\nschool have been adopted by the local board of education (in New York City, the\nchancellor or chancellor's designee): (ii)\na formal phase out or closure plan has\nbeen developed and approved in accordance with the requirements of the\nintervention prescribed by the Commissioner pursuant to subdivision (i) of this\nsection: and\n(iii)\nparents, teachers, administrators, and community members have been provided an\nopportunity to participate in the development of the phase out or closure\nplan. (n) Accountability system for schools and districts based on 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 school year results. Provisions of this subdivision of this\nsection are pursuant to the provisions of this section prior to the 2025-2026\nschool year based on 2024-2025 school year results and may not reflect any\namendments to this section beginning in the 2025-2026 school year and any year\nthereafter. (1)\n\nDefinitions. Notwithstanding\nthe provisions of subdivision (b) of this section, the following definitions\nshall be used by the Commissioner to review school and district performance\nbased on 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 school year results. (i) Minimum n size\nshall\nmean the minimum number of student results that are included within an\naccountability subgroup to make an accountability determination on a particular\naccountability measure. For purposes of this subdivision, the minimum n size is\n30 unless otherwise provided. For the Weighted Average Achievement Index and\nthe Core Subject Performance Index, the minimum n size applies to the\ndenominator used to calculate the indices. For English Language Proficiency\n(ELP); Chronic Absenteeism (CA); and Graduation Rate, the minimum n size\napplies to the denominator used to calculate the rates. Provided, however, that\nwhere the Weighted Average Achievement Index student results for an\naccountability group are equal to or greater than 30, a Core Subject\n\nPerformance Index shall be computed for that accountability group so long as\nthere are a minimum of 15 student results for the Core Subject Performance\n\nIndex and the number of student results for the Core Subject Performance Index\nequals at least 50 percent of the number of results for the Weighted Average\n\nAchievement Index. Provided further that, where the Weighted Average\n\nAchievement Index student results for a high school accountability group are\nequal to or greater than 30, a graduation rate shall be computed for that\naccountability group so long as there are a minimum of 15 students in the\ngraduation cohort. (ii)\n\nAn\naccountability measure\nshall mean a measure used for the purpose of\nimplementing the system of accountability for schools and districts in\naccordance with the provisions of this section and shall include the following\nmeasures for elementary/middle schools: (1)\n\nWeighted Average Achievement Performance; (2)\n\nCore Subject Performance; (3)\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency; and\n(4)\n\nChronic Absenteeism as\ndescribed in this subdivision. High school accountability measures shall\ninclude the four preceding factors as well as Graduation\n\nRate. (iii)\n\nSchools identified for [comprehensive support] Comprehensive Support\nand [improvement] Improvement (CSI) (elementary and middle schools).

The Commissioner shall also identify for CSI\nthose public elementary/middle schools that do not receive Title I funds that\nmeet the criteria used to identify Title I schools for CSI. Provided further\nthat a school that had been identified for CSI during the 2021-2022 school year\nthat does not meet the criteria for exiting the CSI support model pursuant to\nparagraph (5) of this subdivision shall remain identified for CSI. (b) For the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 school\nyears, the Commissioner shall not newly identify schools for CSI and will\nresume CSI identifications in the 2025-2026 school year based on 2024-2025\nschool year results. (iv)\n\nSchools identified for CSI (high schools). The State shall\ndesignate high schools for CSI using the following criteria: (a) for the 2022-2023 school year, using\n2021-2022 school year results, the Commissioner shall identify a minimum five\npercent of the lowest performing public high schools that receive Title I funds\nfor CSI and shall identify schools for CSI based upon the results from the all\nstudents group based on the accountability measures described in this\nsubdivision. The Commissioner shall also identify for CSI those public high\nschools that do not receive Title I funds that meet the criteria used to\nidentify Title I schools for CSI. Any school with a 2017 Four-Year Graduation\n\nRate below 67 percent and a 2016 Five-Year or 2015 Six-Year Graduation Rate\nthat is not at or above 67 percent shall be preliminarily identified for CSI. Provided further that a school that had been identified for CSI during the\n2021-2022 school year that does not meet the criteria for exiting the CSI\nsupport model pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subdivision shall remain\nidentified for CSI. (b) For the\n2023-2024 and 2024-2025 school years, the Commissioner shall not newly identify\nschools for CSI and will resume CSI identifications in the 2025-2026 school\nyear based on 2024-2025 school year results. (v) Schools identified for Targeted\n\nSupport and Improvement (TSI) (elementary, middle, and high schools)\nshall mean a school with one or more consistently underperforming\naccountability subgroups based on the accountability measures described in this\nsubdivision. In addition, a school identified for TSI based upon 2018-2019\nschool year results with any accountability subgroup that meets the same\nscenario criteria used to identify schools for CSI pursuant to paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision based upon 2021-2022 school year results and that failed to\nmeet the modified criteria for exiting identification support models in this\nsubdivision shall be identified for Additional Targeted Support and Improvement\n(ATSI). Schools identified for TSI based upon 2017 - 2018 school year results\nfor which the identified subgroup(s) failed to meet the modified criteria for\nexiting the ATSI support model in this subdivision based on 2021-2022 school\nyear results shall remain identified for ATSI. (a) For the 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 school\nyears, the Commissioner shall not identify schools for ATSI, and will resume\nATSI identifications in the 2025-2026 school year based on 2024-2025 school\nyear results. (vi)\n\nTarget District\nshall mean any school district with one or\nmore schools identified for CSI, ATSI, or TSI. A\nTarget\n\nDistrict\nshall also mean any district whose district-wide performance\nlevels would cause a subgroup to meet the scenario in the decision table to be\nidentified for CSI, ATSI or TSI pursuant to the provisions of this\nsection. (vii)\n\nFor high school\nstudents, participation rate\nshall mean the percentage of\nstudents in grade 12 during the reporting year who have a valid score on an\napproved high school assessment.

If the identification\nof schools in Scenario 1 results in fewer than five percent of public\nelementary/middle schools in the state that receive Title I funds being\nidentified for CSI, the Commissioner shall then determine which schools in\n\nScenario 2 shall be identified for CSI. The Commissioner shall continue to make\ndeterminations regarding which schools shall be identified for CSI in\ndescending scenario number order until a minimum of five percent of public\nelementary/middle schools that receive Title I funds shall be identified. Once\na minimum of five percent of public elementary/middle schools that receive\n\nTitle I funds have been identified, schools in a higher numbered scenario shall\nbe removed from preliminary identification. (c) In the 2023-2024 school year based on\n2022-2023 school year results and in the 2024-2025 school year based on\n2023-2024 school year results, a threshold on the decision table shall be\ndetermined by progressing through the scenarios until a minimum of five percent\nof the lowest performing elementary/middle schools meet the criteria for\nidentification to determine the list of schools that meet exit criteria in\naccordance with the provisions of paragraph (5) of this subdivision. The\n\nCommissioner shall not identify schools for CSI at the elementary/middle level\nin the 2023-2024 school year based on 2022-2023 school year results or in the\n2024-2025 school year based on 2023-2024 school year results. (ii). Identification of\n\nElementary/Middle Schools for Targeted Support and Improvement (TSI). An\nelementary/middle school shall be preliminarily identified for TSI if an\naccountability subgroup met the criteria for identification for two consecutive\nyears between the 2021-2022 and 2023-2024 school years and that same subgroup\nmeets a scenario using the decision table in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, provided that only Scenario 1 and any other scenarios with numbers\nthat are lower than the highest numbered scenario for which a school was\nidentified for CSI shall be used to identify schools for TSI. (a) For the identification of schools for TSI\nbased on 2021-2022 school year results, the consecutive years will be based on\n2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school year results. (b) The identification of schools for TSI\nshall be based on the performance of accountability subgroups, as defined in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, and shall not include the\nperformance of the all students group; provided that, in order to be\npreliminarily identified using the decision table in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, a performance level must be assigned to, at a minimum, the Weighted\n\nAverage Achievement measure and one or more of the following measures: Core\n\nSubject Performance, English Language Proficiency, and/or Chronic\n\nAbsenteeism.

For each public high school whose all students subgroup meets\nthe minimum n-size requirements as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b)\nof this section, a Graduation Rate Level shall be assigned by the Commissioner. (i) The Commissioner shall first compute the\nschool's 2017 four-year, 2016 five-year, and 2015 six-year Graduation Rates, in\naccordance with subdivision (f) of this section. (ii)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then rank order\nschools based on the unweighted average of the four-year, five-year, and\nsix-year Graduation Rates. (iii)\n\nEach high school shall then be assigned a Graduation Rate Level from 14 based\non such rank ordering using the table below: Graduation Rate Rank\n\nGraduation Rate Level\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(4)\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency Level. For\neach public high school meeting the minimum n-size requirements as defined in\nparagraph (1) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute an English\n\nLanguage Proficiency Level in accordance with subdivision (f) of this\nsection: (5)\n\nChronic Absenteeism\n\nLevel. For each public high school whose all students subgroup meets the\nminimum n-size requirement pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the\n\nCommissioner shall compute a Chronic Absenteeism Level as follows: (i) The Commissioner shall first compute the\nschool's Chronic Absenteeism Rate, in accordance with subdivision (f) of this\nsection.

If the identification\nof schools in Scenario 1 results in fewer than five percent of public high\nschools in the state that receive Title I funds being identified for CSI, the\n\nCommissioner shall then determine which schools in Scenario 2 shall be\nidentified for CSI. The Commissioner shall continue to make determinations\nregarding which schools shall be identified for CSI in descending scenario\nnumber order until a minimum of five percent of public high schools that\nreceive Title I funds shall be identified. Once a minimum of five percent of\npublic high schools that receive Title I funds have been identified, schools in\na higher numbered scenario shall be removed from preliminary\nidentification. (c) In the\n2023-2024 school year based on 2022-2023 school year results and in the\n2024-2025 school year based on 2023-2024 school year results, a threshold on\nthe scenario tables shall be determined by progressing through the scenarios\nuntil a minimum of five percent of the lowest performing high schools meet the\ncriteria for identification to determine the list of schools that meet exit\ncriteria in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision. The Commissioner shall not identify schools for CSI in the\n2023-2024 and the 2024-2025 school years. (ii)\n\nIdentification of high schools for TSI. (a) A high school shall be preliminarily\nidentified for TSI if an accountability subgroup met the criteria for\nidentification for two consecutive years between the 2021-2022 and 2023-2024\nschool years and that same subgroup meets a scenario using the decision table\nin subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, provided that only Scenario 1 and any\nother scenarios with numbers that are lower than the highest numbered scenario\nfor which a school was identified for CSI shall be used to identify schools for\nTSI. (b) For the identification of\nschools for TSI based on 2021-2022 school year results, the consecutive years\nwill be 2018-2019 and 2021-2022 school year results. (c) The identification of schools for TSI\nshall be based on the performance of accountability subgroups, as defined in\nparagraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, and shall not include the\nperformance of the all students group; provided that, in order to be\npreliminarily identified using the decision table in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, a performance level must be assigned to, at a minimum, the Weighted\n\nAverage Achievement measure and Graduation Rate measures and one or more of the\nfollowing measures: Core Subject Performance, English Language Proficiency, and/or Chronic Absenteeism. (iii)\n\nIdentification of high schools for\nATSI. (a) The Commissioner shall identify for\nATSI any school identified for TSI in the 2019-2020 school year based upon\n2018-2019 school year results for which the identified subgroup meets the same\nscenario criteria used to identify schools for CSI pursuant to paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision and that failed to meet the modified criteria for exiting\nsupport models pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subdivision. The Commissioner\nshall not identify schools for ATSI at the high school level in the 2023-2024\nschool year based on 2022-2023 school year results and the 2024-2025 school\nyear based on 2023-2024 school year results. (b) Notwithstanding clause (a) of this\nsubparagraph, schools identified for TSI based on 2017-2018 school year results\nfor which the identified subgroup(s) failed to meet the modified criteria for\nexiting the ATSI support model based on 2021-2022 school year results shall\nremain identified for ATSI. (4)\n\nInterventions. Notwithstanding the\nprovisions of subdivision (i) of this section, interventions in schools\nidentified for CSI, ATSI, and TSI and interventions in Target Districts shall\nbe modified as follows: (i) Any school with\nany accountability measure of Level 1 for any subgroup, as calculated pursuant\nto subdivision (f) of this section, that is not a school identified for CSI, ATSI, or TSI, shall not require a needs assessment based on Level 1\nidentifications using 2021-2022, 2022-2023, or 2023-2024 school year\nresults. (ii)\n\nAnnual Achievement\n\nProgression target shall not be determined using results from the 2021-2022, 2022-2023, or 2023-2024 school years for schools identified for CSI. (iii)\n\nParticipation rate self-assessments and\nparticipation rate improvement plans shall not be required for any school based\non 2021-2022, 2022-2023, or 2023-2024 school year results. (5)\n\nRemoval from accountability support\nmodels. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (j) of this section, the\n\nCommissioner shall use the following procedures to exit schools from\nidentification for CSI, ATSI, and TSI and from Target District identification\nbased on 2021-2022, 2022-2023, or 2023-2024 school year results. (i) For elementary/middle schools: (a) For schools identified for CSI or ATSI, an increase between the school's performance in the 2021-2022 year compared to\nthe 2017-2018 school year, or the 2022-2023 year compared to the 2021-2022\nschool year, based on either the Core Subject Performance Index or the Weighted\n\nAverage Achievement Index for the identified subgroup. Provided, however, that\nan elementary/middle school may not exit the CSI or ATSI support model if the\nschool is identified for CSI or ATSI using 2021-2022 school year results or\nmeets the CSI identification criteria in the 2023- 2024 school year based on\n2022-2023 school year results. (b) Beginning with the 2023-2024 school year results, a school identified for CSI\nand ATSI may exit their support model if there is an increase in performance\nfor two consecutive years on either the Core Subject Performance Index or the\n\nWeighted Average Achievement Index. Provided, however, that an\nelementary/middle school may not exit their CSI or ATSI support model if the\nschool meets the criteria for identification for CSI or ATSI. (c) For schools identified for TSI, the\nschool is not identified for TSI using the 2021-2022 or 2022-2023 school year\nresults. (d) Beginning with the\n2023-2024 school year results, a school identified for TSI may exit their TSI\nsupport model if the school does not meet the TSI criteria for two consecutive\nyears. (ii)\n\nFor high\nschools: (a) For schools identified for CSI or\nATSI, an increase between the school's performance in the 2021-2022 school year\ncompared to the 2017-2018 school year, or the 2023-2024 year compared to the\n2021-2022 school year, based on the Weighted Average Achievement Index or the\nunweighted average of the Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation Rates\ncomputed pursuant to clause (f)(2)(i)(b) of this section for the identified\nsubgroup. Provided, however, that a high school may not exit their CSI or ATSI\nsupport model if the school is identified for CSI or ATSI using 2021-2022\nschool year results or meets the CSI or ATSI identification criteria in the\n2023-2024 school year based on 2022-2023 school year results. (b) Beginning with the 2023-2024 school year\nresults, a school identified for CSI or ATSI may exit the CSI or ATSI support\nmodel if there is an increase in performance for two consecutive years on\neither the Weighted Average Achievement Index or the Core Subject Performance\n\nIndex, or if the unweighted average of the Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year\n\nGraduation Rates is higher than the Graduation Rate at the time of\nidentification for two consecutive years. For schools identified for CSI for\nhaving Graduation Rate less than 67%, the school must have a Graduation Rate at\nor above 67% for two consecutive years to exit the CSI support model. Provided, however, that a high school may not exit the CSI or ATSI support model if the\nschool meets the criteria for identification as CSI or ATSI. (c) For schools identified for TSI, the\nschool is not identified for TSI using the 2021-2022 or 2022-2023 school year\nresults. (d) Beginning with the\n2023-2024 school year results, a school identified for TSI may exit the TSI\nsupport model if the school does not meet the TSI criteria for two consecutive\nyears.

(ii)\n\nGraduates are students in the Graduation Rate Cohort as defined in subparagraph (xvi) of this paragraph who earned a\n\nRegents\nor local diploma by August 31\nst\nof the reporting year. (iii)\n\nThe State baseline means the statewide performance of an accountability subgroup on an accountability measure that is used to establish the State Long-term goals and annual Measures of Interim Progress for that measure. A state baseline shall be established for the following accountability measures: Academic Progress in ELA: Academic Progress in Mathematics: the Four-Year Graduation Rate: the Five-Year Graduation rate: the Six-Year Graduation Rate: chronic absenteeism: and college, career, and civic readiness. (iv)\n\nSchool or district baseline mean the school or school district performance of an accountability subgroup on an accountability measure that is used to establish the school or school district's annual measures of interim progress for that subgroup on that measure. School and district baselines shall be established for the following accountability measures: Academic Progress in ELA: Academic Progress in Mathematics: the Four-Year Graduation Rate: the Five-Year Graduation Rate: the Six-Year Graduation Rate: Chronic Absenteeism: and College, Career, and Civic Readiness. Provided that for schools or districts with subgroups that fail to meet the minimum n size requirements, a school and/or district baseline will be established when such subgroup meets the minimum n size requirements, for the purpose of establishing Measures of Interim Progress. (v) State Measures of Interim Progress (State MIPs). For each accountability measure that a State baseline has been established, the Commissioner shall establish for each accountability subgroup annual State MIPs. Prior to the start of the 2018-19 school year, the Commissioner shall establish State MIPs for the 2017-2018 through the 2021-2022 school years. The Commissioner shall annually establish new State MIPs for the school year next succeeding the last school year for which State MIPs had been previously established. (vi)\n\nSchool and District Measures of Interim Progress (school and district MIPs). For each accountability measure for which a school or district baseline has been established, the Commissioner shall establish for each accountability subgroup annual school and district MIPs. Prior to the start of the 2018-2019 school year, the Commissioner shall establish school and district MIPs for the 2017-2018 through the 2021-2022 school years. The Commissioner shall annually establish new school and district MIPs for the school year next succeeding the last school year for which school and district MIPs had been previously established. In the event that a school and/or district undergoes a significant change in student enrollment as determined by the Commissioner, including but not limited to a change in grade configuration or a significant increase or decrease in numbers of students who are members of an accountability subgroup, the district may petition the Commissioner to revise the school and/or district specific MIPs assigned to one or more accountability subgroups for one or more accountability measures in the school. (vii)\n\nState Long-term goal shall mean the amount of progress the State expects each accountability subgroup to make, based on the State baseline, at the end of a five-year period towards achieving the State End-goal. Exceeding Long-term goal is determined by subtracting the Long-term goal from the State-End-goal, dividing by 2, and then adding the result to the Long-term goal. The outcome must be at or above that resulting number. (viii)\n\nState End-goal shall mean the ultimate desired performance at an undetermined future point for an accountability subgroup on an accountability measure for which a State Long-term goal has been established. (ix)\n\nStudent growth means the change in student achievement for an individual student between two or more points in time. (x) The Mean Student Growth Percentile means the result of a statistical model that calculates each student's change in achievement between two or more points in time on a State assessment and compares each student's performance to that of similarly achieving students. (xi)\n\nThe out-of-school suspension rate shall mean the number of students who were suspended from school (not including in-school suspensions) for one full day or longer anytime during the school year divided by the number of students enrolled on BEDS day of that school year commencing with data collected for the 2022-2023 school year. A student is counted only once, regardless of whether the student was suspended one or more times during the school year. For the 2023-2024 school year results, the Commissioner shall report for each accountability group for which a school or district is accountable a Level from 1-4 based on the out-of-school suspension rate. For the 2023-2024 school year results, districts must implement the provisions of 100.21(i)(4) for any schools that have an accountability group that performs at Level 1 on the out-of-school suspension indicator. Beginning with the 2024-2025 school year results, the out-of-school suspension indicator shall be incorporated into the methodology used to determine the accountability status of schools and districts under this section.

The result of this division is then multiplied by 100. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine a Science Achievement Index for each public school in the State. The Science Achievement Index is a number between 0-250 that is computed for Science for a subgroup by summing the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level 2, plus the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level 3 multiplied by 2, plus the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level 4 multiplied by 2.5 (numerator), and dividing this result by the greater of the number of continuously enrolled students in the subgroup with valid test scores or 95% of continuously enrolled students (denominator). The result of this division is then multiplied by 100. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then compute the Weighted Average Achievement Index, which is a number between 0-250 that is computed as the weighted average of the ELA, Mathematics, and Science achievement indices. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then rank order schools based on their performance on the Weighted Average Achievement Index. (5)\n\nEach elementary/middle school will then be assigned a Weighted Average Achievement Level from 1-4 based on such rank ordering using the table below: Weighted Average Achievement Rank\n\nWeighted Average Achievement Level\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(6)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then compute the Core Subject Performance Index, which is a number from 0-250 that is computed by summing for elementary/middle-level ELA, Mathematics, and Science, the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level 2, plus the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level 3 multiplied by 2, plus the number of continuously enrolled students who scored at Level 4 multiplied by 2.5 (numerator), and dividing this result by the number of valid test results for continuously enrolled students in ELA, Mathematics, and Science (denominator). The result of this division is then multiplied by 100 to determine the Index. (7)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then rank order schools by the Core subject Performance Index. (8)\n\nEach elementary/middle school will then be assigned a Core subject Performance Level 1-4 based on such rank ordering using the table below: Core subject\n\nCore\n\nPerformance Index Rank\n\nSubject Performance Level\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n(9)\n\nThe Commissioner shall combine the results of the Weighted Average Achievement Level as calculated in subclause (5) with the Core Subject Performance Index Level as calculated in subclause (8) to create a Composite Performance Index. The Composite Performance Index for elementary/middle schools is a calculation by which the results of the Weighted Average Achievement Level and the Core Subject Performance Index Level are combined to be used as a measure of academic achievement pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section. Provided that, for elementary/middle schools in the State with the same Composite Performance Index, the Commissioner shall rank order schools using the higher of the Weighted Average Achievement rank order as calculated in subclause (4) or the Core subject Performance Index rank order as calculated in subclause (7) of this clause. (10)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign a Composite Performance Achievement Level from 1-4 for all schools based on the Composite Performance Index rank ordering described in subclause (9) of this clause using the table below: Composite Performance Index Rank\n\nComposite Performance Level\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n\nThe resulting Composite Performance Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) of this section as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (11)\n\nIf the all students subgroup does not meet the minimum n size, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, then the school shall be identified using the established process for small schools (self-assessment process), as described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section. (b) Student Growth Level. For each public elementary/middle school whose all students subgroup meets the minimum n-size requirements as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, a Student Growth Level will be determined in accordance with the following steps: (1)\nA mean growth percentile for the all students subgroup in each school shall be calculated by adding the student growth percentile scores for continuously enrolled students in grades 4-8 ELA to the student growth percentile scores for continuously enrolled students in grades 4-8 math for the current and the previous two school years in which the State Grade 3-8 ELA and math assessments have been administered, and dividing the result by the total number of student growth percentile scores in those grades/subjects and years; (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then create a rank ordered list of school performance based on the school's Mean Growth Percentile score. (3)\nA Student Growth Level from 1-4 shall then be assigned to each school using the table below: Mean Growth Percentile\n\nStudent Growth Level\n45 or less\n1\n45.1 to 50\n2\n50.1 to 54\n3\n\nGreater than 54\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting Student Growth Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of student performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (c) Combined Composite Performance and Growth Level. For each public elementary/middle school meeting the minimum n-size requirement as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, a Combined Composite Performance and Student Growth Level shall be computed by the Commissioner in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall generate a combined Composite Performance and Student Growth rank ordered list by summing a school's Composite Performance Index final rank order as described in subclause (9) of clause (a) of this subparagraph and the school's Student Growth rank order as described in clause (b) of this subparagraph. (2)\n\nIf there is no Student Growth Level for the school because the all students subgroup did not meet the minimum n size for the Student Growth measure, then the Combined Composite Performance and Student Growth Level shall be determined using the Composite Performance Level only. (3)\nA Combined Composite Performance and Student Growth Level from 1-4 shall then be assigned to each school based on the school's placement on a rank ordered list in comparison with other schools in accordance with the following table: Rank Based on Combined Composite Performance and Student Growth\n\nLevel\n\nIn the lowest 10%\n1\n\nBetween 10 1% and 50%\n2\n\nBetween 50 1 and 75%\n3\n\nIn the highest 75%\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting Combined Composite Performance and Student Growth Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (d) English Language Proficiency Level. For each public elementary/middle school meeting the minimum n-size requirements as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute an English Language Proficiency Level in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall first determine an initial level of proficiency and the corresponding years that the student was identified as an English Language Learner based upon the student's performance on the NYSESLAT in the initial year of identification as an English Language Learner pursuant to Part 154 of this Title. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine progress rates for each student based on the years that the student has been identified as an English language learner and the level achieved on the NYSESLAT in the first year in which the student was identified as an English Language Learner pursuant to Part 154 of this Title. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then calculate each school's success ratio based on all continuously enrolled students' results compared to continuously enrolled students' progress rates, as determined by the Commissioner. Utilizing this information, each school shall then be assigned an English Language Proficiency Level from 1-4 in accordance with the following table: Success Ratio\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency Level\n0-0.49\n1\n0.50-0.99\n2\n1.0-1.24\n3\n1.25+\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting English Language Proficiency Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school shall be preliminarily identified as a CSI School. (e) Academic Progress Level. For each public elementary/middle school meeting the minimum-size requirement as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute an Academic Progress Level in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall calculate separate ELA and Mathematics Academic Achievement Indices from 0-250 for the all students subgroup in the school. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine a separate State MIP and Long-term goal for ELA and Mathematics. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall determine a separate school MIP in ELA and in Mathematics. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign an Academic Progress Level in ELA from 1-4 using the table below based on each of the following: whether or not the school's ELA Academic Achievement Index met, exceeded, or failed to meet: (1)\nthe State Long-term goal, (2)\nthe State MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school's MIP. (5)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign an Academic Progress Level in Mathematics from 1 to 4 using the table below based on each of the following: whether or not the school's Mathematics Academic Achievement Index met, exceeded, or failed to meet: (1)\nthe State Long-term goal, (2)\nthe State MIP and/or, (3)\nthe school's MIP. Did Not Meet Long-Term Goal\n\nMet Long-Term Goal\n\nExceeded Long-Term Goal\n\nDid not meet either MIP\nLevel 1\nN/A\nN/A\nMet lower of State or School MIP\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nMet higher of State or School MIP\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nLevel 4\n(6)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then average the ELA Academic Progress Level assigned in subclause (4) of this clause and the Mathematics Academic Progress Level assigned in subclause (5) of this clause. The resulting average Academic Progress Level will be rounded down to the nearest whole number that represents the level that will be used and an Academic Progress Level from 1-4 will be assigned. The resulting Academic Progress Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI School. (7)\n\nNotwithstanding the Academic Progress Level resulting from the table above, using the all students subgroup's baseline performance as measured by the previous school year test results, for purposes of the accountability designation, if the all students subgroup does not meet the lower of the State or school MIP but increases the Achievement Index by an amount at least equal to the difference between the higher of the school's current year MIP and prior year MIP or the current year State MIP and prior year State MIP, the all students subgroup will be assigned an Academic Progress Level 2. Provided further that, if the all students subgroup meets either but not both of the school and State MIP for that subgroup and makes progress that is\nequivalent\nto at least three times the difference between the lower of the school specific current and prior year MIPs and the State current and prior year MIPs for that subgroup, but if such progress is insufficient for the subgroup to meet the higher of the State or school MIP or the Long-term goal, the all students subgroup will be assigned an Academic Progress Level 3. (f) Chronic Absenteeism Level. For each public elementary/middle school meeting the minimum n-size requirement pursuant to subparagraph (xvii) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute a Chronic Absenteeism Level in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall first compute the school's Chronic Absenteeism Rate, which means the number of students enrolled during the school year in a school for a minimum of ten instructional days and in attendance at least one of those days who were absent (excused or unexcused) for at least 10 percent of enrolled instructional days divided by the total number of students enrolled during the school year, expressed as a percentage. Suspensions are not counted as excused or unexcused absences, as suspended students are required to be provided with instruction while they are suspended. At the elementary/middle level. Chronic Absenteeism is calculated for grades 1-8 and ungraded age\nequivalent\nstudents. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine a State MIP and Long-term goal for Chronic Absenteeism. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall also determine a school MIP for Chronic Absenteeism. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign a Chronic Absenteeism Level from 1-4 based on whether the school's Chronic Absenteeism Rate, as defined in this clause met, exceeded, or failed to meet: (1)\nthe State Long-term goal, (2)\nthe State MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school MIP. Utilizing this information, each school shall then be assigned a Chronic Absenteeism Level from 1-4 in accordance with the following table: Did Not Meet Long-Term Goal\n\nMet Long-Term Goal\n\nExceeded Long-Term Goal\n\nDid not meet either MIP\nLevel 1\nN/A\nN/A\nMet lower MIP\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nMet higher MIP\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nLevel 4\n(5)\n\nThe resulting Chronic Absenteeism Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (6)\n\nNotwithstanding the Chronic Absenteeism Level generated by the table above, for purposes of the accountability designation, if the all students subgroup does not meet the lower of the State or school MIP but decreases the Chronic Absenteeism Rate by an amount equal to the difference between the lower of the school's current year MIP and prior year MIP or the current year State MIP and prior year MIP for the all students subgroup, the all students subgroup will be assigned a Chronic Absenteeism Level 2. Provided further that, if the all students subgroup meets either but not both the school and State MIP for that subgroup and makes progress in decreasing the Chronic Absenteeism Rate that is\nequivalent\nto three times the difference between the lower of the school specific current and prior year MIP and the State current and prior year MIP for the all students subgroup, but if such progress is insufficient for the all students subgroup to meet the more rigorous of the State or school MIP or the State Long-term goal, the all students subgroup will be assigned a Chronic Absenteeism Level 3. (7)\n\nProvided further that, notwithstanding the Chronic Absenteeism Level determined pursuant to paragraphs (4), (5) and (6), the Commissioner may assign a Chronic Absenteeism Level 1 to an all students subgroup whose chronic absenteeism rate is below a percent established by the Commissioner and the Commissioner may assign a Chronic Absenteeism Level 2 to an all students subgroup whose chronic absenteeism rate is at or above a percent established by the Commissioner. (g) For feeder schools: The Weighted Average Achievement Index and Level, the Core Subject Performance Index and Level, the Composite Performance Index and Level, and the Academic Progress Level of public schools, school districts, and charter schools serving grades 1 and/or 2, but not grade 3 or higher (hereafter referred to as \"feeder schools\") will be determined using back mapping. In school districts with such feeder schools and in school districts that accept grade 3 students from feeder schools in other school districts by contract, the grade 3 State assessment results for each feeder school student will be attributed to the feeder school as well as to the school in which the student took the assessment. The student's results will be attributed to a feeder school only if the student was continuously enrolled in the feeder school from BEDS day until the end of the school year in the highest grade served by the feeder school. For feeder schools, the Combined Composite Performance and Growth Level will be determined using the Elementary/Middle-Level ELA and Math Composite Performance Level only. (ii)\n\nTargeted Support and Improvement (TSI) Elementary/Middle Schools. An elementary/middle school shall be preliminarily identified as a TSI school if the school meets the criteria for identification outlined in the table below for two consecutive school years for the same accountability subgroup, except that a school identified as a Priority or Focus School during the 2017-2018 school year may be identified, using 2017-2018 school year data only, if such school meets the criteria for identification as a TSI school beginning with the 2018-2019 school year. (a) The decision table below combines multiple measures of performance for accountability subgroups in the school using the same methodology used to designate CSI schools pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph and using the following accountability measures: (1)\n\nComposite Performance; (2)\n\nStudent Growth; (3)\n\nCombined Composite Performance and Student Growth; (4)\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency; (5)\n\nAcademic Progress; and\n(6)\n\nChronic Absenteeism. (b) The designations for TSI schools shall be based on the performance of accountability subgroups, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section and shall not include the performance of the all students accountability subgroup: provided that, in order to be preliminarily identified using the decision table below, a performance level must be assigned to, at a minimum, the Combined Composite Performance and Student Growth measure and one or more of the following measures: English Language Proficiency, Academic Progress, and/or Chronic Absenteeism.

(c) If a school meets the identification criteria for both a CSI and TSI school, the school shall be designated as a CSI school: provided however that if in the year in which a CSI school is removed from CSI identification and such school meets the criteria for a TSI school, the school shall be designated as a TSI school. (d) When the Commissioner creates a rank ordered list for the racial/ethnic subgroup for purposes of identification of TSI schools, one rank ordered list will be generated for all racial/ethnic groups combined. (iii)\nTSI schools identified for additional support. (a) Beginning with the 2018-2019 school year, for each year in which the Commissioner identifies CSI schools based on the performance of the all students subgroup in accordance with subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) of this section, the Commissioner shall identify for additional targeted support any TSI school with a subgroup whose performance would have caused the school to be identified as a CSI school using the methods for identification specified in subdivision (f) of this section. (b) Such school shall be identified for additional targeted support only if the school had been identified as a TSI school in the prior school year and remains so identified in the current school year. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (a) of this subparagraph, in assigning Performance Levels for the purpose of determining whether the performance of a subgroup in a TSI school would have caused the school to be identified as a CSI school, the Commissioner shall: (1)\n\nAssign to the subgroup the Weighted Average Achievement Level that would have been assigned to the all students subgroup with the same Weighted Average Achievement Index for purposes of identifying CSI schools. (2)\n\nAssign to the subgroup the Core Subject Performance Index Level that would have been assigned to the all students subgroup with the same Core Subject Performance Index for purposes of identifying CSI schools. (3)\n\nAssign to the subgroup the Composite Performance Achievement Level that would have been assigned to the all students subgroup with the same Weighted Average Achievement Level, Weighted Average Achievement Index ranking. Core Subject Performance Index Level and Core Subject Performance Index ranking for purposes of identifying CSI schools. (4)\n\nAssign to the subgroup the Student Growth Level that would have been assigned to the all students subgroup with the same Mean Student Growth Percentile for purposes of identifying CSI schools. (5)\n\nAssign to the subgroup the Combined Composite Performance and Student Growth Level that would have been assigned to the all students subgroup with the same Combined Composite Performance and Growth rank for purposes of identifying CSI schools. (6)\n\nFor measures of English Language Proficiency; Academic Progress: and Chronic Absenteeism as defined in subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall use the State MIP and State Long-term goal applicable to the all students subgroup to determine the subgroup's performance level on these measures. (2)\n\nAccountability system for high schools. (i) CSI schools. A high school shall be preliminarily identified as a CSI school using the following decision table, which combines multiple measures of performance for all students in the school, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, using the following accountability measures: (1)\n\nComposite Performance; (2)\n\nGraduation Rate; (3)\n\nCombined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate; (4)\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency; (5)\n\nAcademic Progress; (6)\n\nChronic Absenteeism; and\n(7)\n\nCollege, Career, and Civic Readiness: provided that in order to be preliminarily identified using the decision table below a performance level must be assigned to, at a minimum, the Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate measure and one or more of the following measures: English Language Proficiency: Academic Progress: Chronic Absenteeism: and/or College, Career, and Civic Readiness (\"CCCR\"). A school shall be preliminarily identified as a CSI school if it meets any of the conditions in the rows of the decision table below. Provided, however, that notwithstanding the table below, beginning with 2017-2018 school year graduation results, any public high school with a Four-Year Graduation Rate below 67 percent and a Five-Year or Six-Year Graduation Rate that is not at or above 67 percent will be preliminarily identified as a CSI school.

(a) Composite Performance Level. For each public high school whose all students group, as an accountability subgroup defined in subparagraph (x) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, meets the minimum n-size requirements pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, a Composite Performance Level using the results of the ELA, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies assessments for the Accountability Cohort shall be computed by the Commissioner in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall first calculate a Performance Index separately for ELA, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies at the secondary level using the following formula for each subject: (i) The sum of the number of students in the Accountability Cohort who scored at Level 2, plus the number who scored at Level 3 multiplied by 2, plus the number who scored at Level 4 multiplied by 2.5 (numerator), divided by the number of students in the Accountability Cohort as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of this section (denominator). The result of this division is then multiplied by 100 to establish the Performance Index for each subject area. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then combine the Performance Indices for ELA, Mathematics, Science, and Social Studies to calculate a Composite Performance Index in accordance with the following formula: (i) The sum of the ELA Performance Index multiplied by three, plus the result of the Mathematics Performance Index multiplied by three, plus the result of the Science Performance Index multiplied by two, plus the result of the Social Studies Performance Index multiplied by one, divided by the sum of the multipliers used to make this calculation. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then rank order schools based on their Composite Performance Index in accordance with subclause (2) of this clause, except that upon a finding of extenuating or extraordinary circumstances, the Commissioner may in creating the rank ordered list exclude from the rankings those schools that meet the criteria established in subparagraphs (vii) and (xviii) of paragraph (b) of this section as well as schools that are implementing a plan for school closure or phase out that has been\napproved\nby the Commissioner. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign a Composite Performance Achievement Level for all schools based on the rank ordering described in subclause (3) of this clause using the table below: Composite Performance Index Rank\n\nComposite Performance Achievement Level\n10% or Less\n1\n10.1 to 50%\n2\n50.1 to 75%\n3\n\nGreater than 75%\n4\n*\"The Commissioner may exclude from the rank ordered list schools defined in subparagraph (VII) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section or schools defined in subdivision 8 of section\n4001\nof the Education Law. The resulting Composite Performance Achievement Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school shall be preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (5)\n\nIf the all students subgroup does not meet the minimum n size for the Composite Performance Achievement Level, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, then the school shall be identified using the established self-assessment process, as described in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section. (b) Graduation Rate Level. For each public high school meeting the minimum n-size requirement pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute a Graduation Rate Level for the Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation Rate, as applicable in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall first determine a State MIP and Long-term goal based on the State Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation Rate. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall also determine a school MIP based on the school's Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation Rate. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign a Graduation Rate Level from 1 to 4 based on the average of the school's Four-Year, Five-Year and Six-Year Graduation Rates, as available, based on whether or not the school met, exceeded, or failed to meet each of the following: (1)\nthe State Long-term goal, (2)\nthe State MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school MIP for the Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation Rate in accordance with the following table: Did Not Meet Long-Term Goal\n\nMet Long-Term Goal\n\nExceeded Long-Term Goal\n\nDid not meet either MIP\nLevel 1\nN/A\nN/A\nMet lower MIP\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nMet higher MIP\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nLevel 4\n(4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then average the Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation Rate Level, as applicable to the school. The resulting average Graduation Rate Level will be rounded to the nearest level for a Graduation Rate Level from 1-4. (5)\n\nThe resulting Graduation Rate Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (6)\n\nAfter the Graduation Rate Level has been assigned to the school, the Commissioner shall create a Graduation Rate rank order list by first rank ordering schools by Graduation Rate Level and then rank ordering schools by their average Graduation Rate within each level. (7)\n\nProvided, however, that notwithstanding the table above, any public high school with a graduation rate of 67 percent or below on the Four-Year Graduation Rate cohort that does not have a Five-Year or Six-Year Graduation Rate Cohort at or above 67 percent shall be preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (8)\n\nProvided further that, notwithstanding the Graduation Rate Level generated by the table above, for purposes of the accountability designation, if the all students subgroup does not meet the lower of the State or school MIP but increases the graduation rate by an amount at least equal to the difference between the lower of the school's current year MIP and prior year MIP or the State's current year MIP and prior year MIP for the all students subgroup, the all students subgroup will be assigned a Graduation Rate Level 2. Provided further that, if the all students subgroup meets either but not both of the school and State MIP for the all students subgroup and makes progress that is at least equal to three times the difference between the lower of the school-specific current and prior year MIPs and the State's current and prior year MIPs for the all students subgroup, but if such progress is insufficient for the all students subgroup to meet the higher of the State or school MIP or the Long-term goal, the all students subgroup will be assigned a Graduation Rate Level 3. (9)\n\nProvided further that, notwithstanding the Graduation Rate Level determined pursuant to paragraphs (7) and (8), the Commissioner may assign a Graduation Level 1 to an all students subgroup whose unweighted average Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year graduation rates are below a percent established by the Commissioner and the Commissioner may assign a Graduation Level 2 to an all students subgroup whose unweighted average Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year graduation rates is at or above a percent established by the Commissioner. (c) Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate Level. For each public high school meeting the minimum n-size requirement as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, a Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate Level shall be computed by the Commissioner in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall generate a combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate rank ordered list by summing a school's Composite Performance Index rank order, as described in clause (a) of this subparagraph, and the school's Graduation Rate rank order as described in clause (b) of this subparagraph. (2)\nA Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate Level from 1-4 shall then be assigned to each school based on the school's Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate ranking in accordance with the following table. Rank Based on Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate Rankings\n\nCombined Composite Performance & Graduation Rate Level\n\nIn the lowest 10%\n1\n\nBetween 10.1% and 50%\n2\n\nBetween 50.1 and 75%\n3\n\nIn the highest 75%\n4\n*\"The Commissioner may exclude from the rank ordered list schools defined in subparagraph (VII) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section or schools defined in subdivision 8 of section\n4001\nof the Education Law. (3)\n\nThe resulting Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate Level shall then be used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI school: provided that if the all students subgroup does not meet the minimum n size for the Graduation Rate measure, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, then the Combined Composite Performance and Graduate Rate Level will be determined using the Composite Performance Level only. (d) English Language Proficiency Level. For each public high school meeting the minimum n-size requirements as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute an English Language Proficiency Level in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall first determine an initial level of proficiency and the corresponding years that the student was identified as an English Language Learner based upon the student's performance on the NYSESLAT in the initial year of identification as an English Language Learner pursuant to Part 154 of this Title. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine progress rates for each student based on the years identified as an English language learner and the level achieved on the NYSESLAT in the first year in which the student was identified as an English Language Learner pursuant to Part 154 of this Title. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then calculate each school's success ratio based on all continuously enrolled students' results compared to the continuously enrolled students' progress rates, as determined by the Commissioner. Utilizing this information, each school shall then be assigned an English Language Proficiency Level from 1-4 in accordance with the following table: Success Ratio\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency Level\n0-0.49\n1\n0.50-0.99\n2\n1.0-1.24\n3\n1.25+\n4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting English Language Proficiency Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school shall be preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (e) Academic Progress Level. For each public high school meeting the minimum n-size requirement as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute an Academic Progress Level in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall calculate separate ELA and Mathematics Academic Achievement Indices from 0-250 for the all students subgroup in the school. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine a separate State MIP and Long-term goal for ELA and Mathematics. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall determine a separate school MIP in ELA and Mathematics. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign an Academic Progress Level in ELA from 1-4 using the table below based on each of the following: whether or not the school's ELA Academic Achievement Index met, exceeded, or failed to meet: (1)\nthe State Long-term goal, (2)\nthe State MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school's MIP. (5)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign an Academic Progress Level in Mathematics from 1-4 using the table below based on whether the school's Mathematics Academic Achievement Index met, exceeded, or failed to meet: (1)\nthe State Long-term goal, (2)\nthe State MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school MIP. Did Not Meet Long-Term Goal\n\nMet Long-Term Goal\n\nExceeded Long-Term Goal\n\nDid not meet either MIP\nLevel 1\nN/A\nN/A\nMet lower of State or School MIP\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nMet higher of State or School MIR\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nLevel 4\n(6)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then average the ELA Academic Progress Level assigned in subclause (4) of this clause and the Mathematics Academic Progress Level assigned in subclause (5) of this clause. The resulting average Academic Progress Level will be rounded down to the nearest whole number that represents the level that will be used and an Academic Progress Level from 1-4 will be assigned. The resulting Academic Progress Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (7)\n\nNotwithstanding the Academic Progress Level resulting from the table above, using the all students subgroup's baseline performance as measured by the previous school year test results, for purposes of the accountability designation, if the all students subgroup does not meet the lower of the State or school MIP but increases the Achievement Index by an amount at least equal to the difference between the higher of the school's current year MIP and prior year MIP or the current year State MIP and prior year State MIP, the all students subgroup will be assigned an Academic Progress Level 2. Provided further that, if the all students subgroup meets either but not both of the school and State MIPs for that subgroup and makes progress that is\nequivalent\nto at least three times the difference between the lower of the school-specific current and prior year MIPs and the State current and prior year MIPs for that subgroup, but if such progress is insufficient for the subgroup to meet the higher of the State or school MIP or the Long-term goal, the all students subgroup will be assigned an Academic Progress Level 3. (f) Chronic Absenteeism Level. For each public high school meeting the minimum n-size requirement pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute a Chronic Absenteeism Level in accordance with the following steps: (1)\n\nThe Commissioner shall first compute the school's Chronic Absenteeism Rate, which means the number of students enrolled during the school year in a school for a minimum of ten instructional days and in attendance at least one of those days who were absent (excused or unexcused) for at least 10 percent of enrolled instructional days divided by the total number of students enrolled during the school year, expressed as a percentage. Suspensions are not counted as excused or unexcused absences, as suspended students are required to be provided with instruction while they are suspended. At the high school level, chronic absenteeism is calculated for grades nine-12 and ungraded age\nequivalent\nstudents. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then determine a State MIP and Long-term goal for Chronic Absenteeism. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall also determine a school MIP for Chronic Absenteeism. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign a Chronic Absenteeism Level from 1-4 based on whether the school's Chronic Absenteeism Rate, as defined in this clause met, exceeded, or failed to meet: (1)\nthe State Long-term goal, (2)\nthe State MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school MIP. Each school shall then be assigned a Chronic Absenteeism Level from 1-4 in accordance with the following table: Did Not Meet Long-Term Goal\n\nMet Long-Term Goal\n\nExceeded Long-Term Goal\n\nDid not meet either MIP\nLevel 1\nN/A\nN/A\nMet lower MIP\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nMet higher MIP\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nLevel 4\n(5)\n\nThe resulting Chronic Absenteeism Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (6)\n\nNotwithstanding the Chronic Absenteeism Level generated by the table above, for purposes of the accountability designation, if the all students subgroup does not meet the lower of the State or school MIP but decreases the Chronic Absenteeism Rate by an amount equal to the difference between the lower of the school's current year MIP and prior year MIP or the current year State MIP and prior year MIP for the all students subgroup, the all students subgroup will be assigned a Chronic Absenteeism Level 2. Provided further that, if the all students subgroup meets either but not both the school and State MIP for that subgroup and makes progress toward decreasing the Chronic Absenteeism Rate that is\nequivalent\nto three times the difference between the lower of the school specific current and prior year MIP and the State current and prior year MIP for the all students subgroup, but if such progress is insufficient for the all students subgroup to meet the higher of the State or school MIP or the State Long-term goal, the all students subgroup will be assigned a Chronic Absenteeism Level 3. (7)\n\nProvided further that, notwithstanding the Chronic Absenteeism Level determined pursuant to paragraphs (4), (5) and (6), the Commissioner may assign a Chronic Absenteeism Level 1 to an all students subgroup whose chronic absenteeism rate is below a percent established by the Commissioner and the Commissioner may assign a Chronic Absenteeism Level 2 to an all students subgroup whose chronic absenteeism rate is at or above a percent established by the Commissioner. (g) College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level. For each public high school meeting the minimum n-size requirement pursuant to paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall compute a College, Career, and Civic Readiness Index. (1)\n\nThe Index is calculated using the number of students in the 4-Year Graduation Rate Cohort as of June 30 of the reporting year plus any members of the English language learner subgroup who earn a\n\nRegents\n\nDiploma with a Seal of Biliteracy who are not members of the 4-Year Graduation Rate Cohort as the denominator. (2)\n\nThe numerator is the number of these students demonstrating success on specific college, career, and civic readiness using specific measures multiplied by the weighting (0.5 to 2.0) assigned to each of these measures in accordance with table below plus the number of students who earned a High School Equivalency diploma in the current reporting year and students who were members of the English language learner subgroup at the time of graduation who earned a\n\nRegents\n\nDiploma with a Seal of Biliteracy in the reporting year, regardless of whether or not they were in the 4-year Graduation Rate Cohort. In accordance with the provisions of Section\n100.5\nof this Part: Regents\n\nDiploma with Advanced Designation\n\nRegents\nor Local Diploma with CTE Technical Endorsement\n\nRegents\n\nDiploma with Seal of Biliteracy\n\nRegents\n\nDiploma and score of 3 or higher on an Advanced Placement exam\n\nRegents\n\nDiploma and score of 4 or higher on an International Baccalaureate exam\n\nRegents\nor Local Diploma and the passage of nationally certified Career and Technical\n\nEducation (CTE) examination\n\nRegents\n\nDiploma and high school credit earned through participation in dual enrollment (in high school and accredited college) course\n\nSkills and achievement commencement credential as provided in section\n100.6\n(a) of this\n\nPart and a Level 4 on the New York State Alternate Assessment for students with disabilities as defined in section\n100.1\n(t)(2)(iv)\nof this Part. Annual ELL and earned\n\nRegents\nwith Seal of Biliteracy in current reporting year and not in 4- year graduation-rate cohort\n2.0\n\nIn accordance with the provisions of Section\n100.5\nof this Part: Regents\n\nDiploma and high school credit earned through participation in an Advanced\n\nPlacement course\n\nRegents\n\nDiploma and high school credit earned through participation in an International\n\nBaccalaureate course\n\nRegents\n\nDiploma with Career Development and Occupational Studies (CDOS) endorsement\n\nSkills and achievement commencement credential as provided in section\n100.6\n(a) of this\n\nPart and Level 3 on the New York State Alternate Assessment for students with disabilities as defined in section\n100.1\n(t)(2)(iv)\nof this Part. 1.5\n\nRegents\nor Local Diploma only in accordance with provisions of section\n100.5\nof this Part Skills and achievement commencement credential as provided in section\n100.6\n(a) of this Part and an achievement Level 2 on the NYSAA\n1.0\n\nAnnual high school equivalency diploma recipients\n(included in numerator but not denominator)\n\nNew York State career development and occupational studies commencement credential as provided in section\n100.6\n(b) of this Part. 0.5\n\nNo high school diploma or high school equivalency diploma. 0\n\nTo determine the College, Career, and Civic Readiness Index, the numerator is divided by the denominator, and the result is multiplied by 100. (3)\n\nThe Commissioner shall then assign a College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level from 1 to 4 based on the table below and whether or not the College, Career, and Civic Readiness Index met, exceeded, or failed to meet each of the following: (1)\nthe State Long-term goal, (2)\nthe State MIP, and/or\n(3)\nthe school MIP. Did Not Meet Long-Term Goal\n\nMet Long-Term Goal\n\nExceeded Long-Term Goal\n\nDid not meet either MIP\nLevel 1\nN/A\nN/A\nMet lower MIP\nLevel 2\n\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nMet higher MIP\nLevel 3\n\nLevel 4\n\nLevel 4\n(4)\n\nThe resulting College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level is then used in the table described in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of this subdivision as one of multiple measures of performance to determine whether the school is preliminarily identified as a CSI school. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding the College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level generated by the table above, using the all students subgroup's baseline performance as measured by the previous school year test results, for purposes of the accountability designation, if the all students subgroup does not meet the lower of the State or school MIP but increases the College, Career, and Civil Readiness Index by an amount at least equal to the difference between the higher of the school's current year MIP and prior year MIP or the State current year MIP and prior year MIP, the all students subgroup will be assigned a College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level 2. Provided further that, if the all students subgroup meets either but not both of the school and State MIP for that subgroup and makes progress that is\nequivalent\nto at least three times the difference between the lower of the school-specific current and prior year MIPs and the State current and prior year MIPs for that subgroup, but if such progress is insufficient for the subgroup to meet the higher of the State or School MIP or the Long-Term Goal, the all students subgroup will be assigned a College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level 3, (6)\n\nProvided further that, notwithstanding the College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level determined pursuant to paragraph (3), (4), and (5), the Commissioner may assign a College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level 1 to an all students subgroup whose College, Career, and Civic Readiness Index is below a benchmark established by the Commissioner and the Commissioner may assign a College, Career, and Civic Readiness Level 2 to an all students subgroup whose College, Career, and Civic Readiness Index is at or above a benchmark established by the Commissioner. (ii)\n\nTargeted Support and Improvement High Schools. A high school shall be preliminarily identified as a TSI school if the school meets the criteria for identification outlined in the table below for two consecutive school years for the same accountability subgroup, except that a school identified as a Priority or Focus School during the 2017-2018 school year may be identified, using 2017-2018 school year data only, if such school meets the criteria for identification as a TSI school beginning with the 2018-2019 school year. (a) The decision table below combines multiple measures for accountability subgroups in the school using the same methodology used to designate CSI schools pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph and using the following accountability measures: (1)\n\nComposite Performance: (2)\n\nGraduation Rate: (3)\n\nCombined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate: (4)\n\nEnglish Language Proficiency: (5)\n\nAcademic Progress: (6)\n\nChronic Absenteeism: and\n(7)\n\nCollege, Career, and Civic Readiness. (b) The designations for TSI schools shall be based on the performance of accountability subgroups, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (b) of this section and shall not include the performance of the all students accountability subgroup: provided that in order to be preliminarily identified using the decision table below a performance level must be assigned to, at a minimum, the Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate measure and one or more of the following measures: English Language Proficiency: Academic Progress: Chronic Absenteeism: and/or College, Career, and Civic Readiness.

(c) If a high school meets the identification criteria for both a CSI and TSI school, the high school shall be designated as a CSI school: provided however that if in the year in which a CSI school is removed from CSI identification and such school meets the criteria for a TSI school, the school shall be designated as a TSI school. (d) When the Commissioner creates a rank ordered list for the racial/ethnic subgroup for purposes of identification of a TSI school, one rank ordered list will be generated for all racial/ethnic groups combined. (iii)\nTSI High Schools identified for additional support. (a) Beginning with the 2018-2019 school year, for each year in which the Commissioner identifies CSI schools based on the performance of the all students subgroup in accordance with subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (f) of this section, the Commissioner shall identify for additional targeted support any TSI high school with a subgroup whose performance would have caused the school to be identified as a CSI school using the methods for identification specified in subdivision (f) of this section. (b) Such high school shall be identified for additional targeted support only if the school had been identified as a TSI school in the prior school year and remains so identified in the current school year. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (a) of this subparagraph, in assigning Performance Levels for the purpose of determining whether the performance of a subgroup in a TSI school would have caused the school to be identified as a CSI school, the Commissioner shall: (1)\n\nAssign to the subgroup the Composite Performance Level that would have been assigned to the all students subgroup with the same Composite Performance Index for purposes of identifying CSI schools. (2)\n\nAssign to the subgroup the Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate Level that would have been assigned to the all students subgroup with the same Combined Composite Performance and Graduation Rate ranking for purposes of identifying CSI schools. (3)\n\nFor the Graduation Rate, Academic Progress, Chronic Absenteeism, and the College, Career, and Civil Readiness measures, the Commissioner shall use the State MIPS and Long-term goals applicable to the all students subgroup to determine the subgroup's levels on these indicators. (3)\n\nTarget Districts. (i) Any school district with one or more CSI or TSI schools identified pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be identified as a Target District. (ii)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this section to the contrary, the Commissioner shall apply the accountability measures for identification as a CSI or TSI school to the school district as a whole, and if such district meets the criteria for identification as a CSI or TSI school, the district shall be identified as a Target District in accordance with the timelines and procedures prescribed in this section for identification of CSI schools and TSI schools. (g) For each school preliminarily identified as a TSI school or CSI school, and for each school district preliminarily identified as a Target District pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section, the school district or charter school shall be given the opportunity to present to the Commissioner additional data and/or any relevant information concerning extenuating or extraordinary circumstances faced by the school or district that should be cause for the Commissioner not to identify the school as a CSI or TSI school or the district as a Target District. (h) Public notification of identification as a CSI or TSI school or a Target District. (1)\n\nUpon receipt of a designation as a CSI or TSI school or Target District, the board of education (in New York City, the chancellor or the chancellor's designee) or charter school board of trustees shall take appropriate action to notify the general public of the issuance of such designation. Such action shall include, but not be limited to, direct notification, within 30 days of receipt of the Commissioner's designation, in English and translated, when appropriate and to the extent practicable for the most frequently used languages in the district, into the recipient's native language or mode of communication, to persons in parental relation of children attending the school that it has been designated as a CSI or TSI school, or Target District and disclosure of such designation by the school district at the next public meeting of the local board of education or by the charter school board of trustees at the next public meeting. (2)\n\nEach school year during which a school remains identified as a CSI or TSI school or Target District, by June 30th or at the time of a student's initial application or\nadmission\nto the school, whichever is earliest, the board of education or charter school board of trustees shall provide direct notification to parents or other persons in parental relation to children attending the school or district, as applicable, that the school or district remains a CSI or TSI school or Target District, as applicable. Such notification shall include a summary of the actions that the school district and school are taking to improve student results and an explanation of any district programs of choice, magnet programs, transfer policies, or other options that a parent or a person in parental relation may have to place the child in a different public school within the school district. Such notification shall include the timelines and process for parents exercising their rights to school choice. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) or (2) of this subdivision, in the event that a CSI school has been identified as a struggling school or a persistently struggling school pursuant to section\n100.19\nof this Part and/or a school under registration review pursuant to this section, the district may use a single notification to fulfill the annual public notification requirements of this section and section\n100.19\n(c)(1)(ii)\nof this Part. (i) Interventions. Beginning with accountability designations made on or after July 1, 2018, all CSI and TSI schools and Target Districts shall implement all interventions applicable to such designations under this subdivision. Provided, however, that a charter school identified as a CSI or TSI school shall not be required to implement the interventions applicable to the school accountability designation pursuant to this subdivision and, in lieu of such interventions, such identified charter school shall take such actions as are required by its charter authorizer pursuant to Article 56 of the Education Law consistent with the charter agreement that each charter school has with its charter authorizer. Provided further, however, that any school identified as of June 30, 2018 as a priority or focus school pursuant to section\n100.18\nof this Part shall implement a school comprehensive education plan in the 2018-2019 school year that meets the requirements for such plan as specified in section\n100.18\nof this Part. Provided further that any school required to offer public school choice prior to July 1, 2018 pursuant to section\n100.18\nof this Part shall continue to permit any students to remain in the school to which they have transferred and provide transportation until such students have completed the highest grade level in the school to which such students have transferred, in the manner required by the provisions of section\n120.3\nof this Part. (1)\n\nInterventions for CSI Schools. (i) In the first school year in which the school is identified as a CSI school, the school must: (a) participate in a comprehensive needs assessment conducted in accordance with subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of this section: (b) develop, in consultation with parents, school staff, and other stakeholders pursuant to section\n100.11\nof this Part, a school comprehensive education plan as defined in subparagraph (viii) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of this section. Such plan shall: (1)\nbe formally\napproved\nby the board of education (in New York City, approved\nby the chancellor or chancellor's designee) and submitted for\napproval\nto the Commissioner by July 1 of the school year in which the plan is required to be implemented: (2)\nbe implemented no later than the first day of regular student attendance of the next school year after the school year in which the school was identified: (3)\nbe updated annually and incorporate the findings of the comprehensive needs assessment or progress needs assessment as applicable, and be implemented no later than the first day of regular student attendance of each year that the school remains a CSI school: (4)\nbe made widely available through public means by either posting on the district's or school's website, if one exists, or displayed conspicuously within the school, according to such timeline as may be prescribed by the Commissioner: (5)\nbe developed in consultation with parents, school staff, and others pursuant to section\n100.11\nof this Part: and\n(6)\ninclude a description of the goals, targets, and activities, and include timelines for the implementation of school-level evidence-based interventions and job-embedded professional development as defined in subparagraphs (v) and (ix) and of paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of this section. (c) limit incoming teachers transfers to teachers rated effective or highly effective pursuant to Education Law 3012-d by a school district in the previous school year, subject to collective bargaining as required under article 14 of the Civil Service Law, and require that any successor collective bargaining agreement authorize such transfers unless otherwise prohibited by law: (d) establish a participatory budgeting process as defined in subparagraph (x) subparagraph (4) of subdivision (b) of this section or provide opportunities for parent and student engagement in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner: (e) conduct parent, staff, and student surveys as defined in subparagraph (xi) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of this section: and\n(f) notify parents and the public of the school's designation as a CSI school in accordance with subdivision (i) of this section. (ii)\n\nIn the second school year of identification as a CSI school: (a) except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the school shall continue to implement the requirements established by subparagraph (i) of this subdivision, including the school comprehensive education plan: (b) obtain prior\napproval\nof the Commissioner for any significant modification to the school's\napproved\ncomprehensive education plan: (c) the principal must submit to the district on a quarterly basis a report of the leading indicators identified in the comprehensive education plan detailing the progress made toward meeting the goals set forth in the school's comprehensive education plan: (d) any CSI school that has met or exceeded its Annual Achievement Progression targets, as defined in paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of this section, in the first set of available annual assessment data following the school's identification will receive a progress needs assessment, which will inform the development of and/or any amendments or modifications to the school comprehensive education plan to be implemented in the following school year: (e) Any CSI school that has not met or exceeded its Annual Achievement Progression targets, as defined in paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of this section, in the first set of available annual assessment data following the school's identification, will receive either a progress needs assessment or a comprehensive needs assessment, as determined by the Commissioner and based on the needs of the school as exhibited by the most recent performance on the accountability measures. In addition to the needs assessment, as determined by the Commissioner, the district shall also submit a principal support report, as defined in subparagraph (xii) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of this section: (iii)\n\nIn the third school year of identification as a CSI school: (a) except as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the school must continue to implement the requirements established by subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, including the school comprehensive education plan: (b) the principal must continue to submit to the district on a quarterly basis a report of the leading indicators identified in the comprehensive needs assessment detailing the progress made toward meeting the goals set forth in the school comprehensive education plan: (c) Any CSI school that has met or exceeded its Annual Achievement Progression targets, as defined in paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of this section, in both the first set of available annual assessment data following the school's identification and the second set of available data following identification, will receive a progress needs assessment, which will inform the development of and/or any modifications to the school comprehensive education plan to be implemented in the following school year. Provided that, if such school makes sufficient progress to be removed from the accountability designation as set forth in subdivision (i) of this section, such school shall be removed from the designation as a CSI school: (d) Any CSI school that did not meet or exceed its Annual Achievement Progression targets as defined in paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of this section, based on the first set of available annual assessment data following the school's identification, but did meet, or exceeded, its Annual Achievement Progression targets based on the second set of available annual assessment data, will receive either a progress needs assessment, which will inform the development of the comprehensive education plan to be implemented in the following school year. (e) Any CSI that did not meet or exceed its Annual Achievement Progression target in the first and second set of available assessment data following the release of accountability determinations will receive a progress needs assessment or comprehensive needs assessment, as determined by the Commissioner and based on the needs of the school as exhibited by the most recent performance on the accountability measures. Provided that, if a progress needs assessment was conducted in previous year of identification, a comprehensive needs assessment must be completed. Any CSI school that did not meet its Annual Achievement Progression target in the first and second set of available assessment data following the release of accountability determinations will also be required to amend the current year's comprehensive education plan, and submit such amendment for the Commissioner's\napproval, within 60 days of the release of the school's Annual Achievement Progression results to identify how the school will partner with a BOCES, Regional Bilingual Educational Resource Network, Teacher Center, or other Regional Technical Assistance Center, or other technical assistance provider as determined by the Commissioner to support the implementation of its comprehensive education plan. Additionally, a Principal Needs Assessment, as defined in subparagraph (xiii) of paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of this section, will be added to the District Needs Assessment process for any district with a CSI school that does not reach its Annual Achievement Progression targets for two consecutive years: and\n(f) Any CSI school that met, or exceeded, its Annual Achievement Progression target as defined in paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of this section, based on the first set of available annual assessment data following the school's identification, but did not meet its Annual Achievement Progression target based on the second set of available annual assessment data, will receive either a progress needs assessment or a comprehensive needs assessment, as determined by the Commissioner and based on the needs of the school as exhibited by the most recent performance on the accountability measures. In addition to the needs assessment, as determined by the Commissioner the district shall also submit a principal support report, as defined in paragraph (4) of subdivision (a) of this section. (g) In any CSI school that has a decline in its Core Subject Performance Index for elementary/middle schools or its Composite Performance Index for high schools for the all students subgroup, as determined by the Commissioner, for two consecutive years, the school district must provide all students enrolled in the school with public school choice in accordance with section\n120.1\nand paragraph (4) of subdivision (b) of this section. Provided further that, in instances when there are no schools in Good Standing or TSI schools serving the grade levels served by the CSI school that is required to provide public school choice, the district shall ensure that the CSI school expends for Participatory Budgeting an amount equal to or greater than three times the amount expended by such school during the first year in which such school implemented Participatory Budgeting. The tripling of the amount to expend is considered to be a one-time action, and the school will be required to expend the resulting amount each year until it is no longer a CSI school (e.g., if district spent $2,000 in Year 1, such amount is tripled to $6,000 in Year 2, and the district must spend $6,000 in Year 3 and each year thereafter until it is no longer a CSI school). In instances when there are schools within the school district that are in Good Standing or TSI but the district is unable to fulfill all of the public school choice transfer requests submitted on behalf of students from the CSI school because there are not enough available seats to accommodate all transfer requests received, then the district must ensure that the CSI school expends for Participatory Budgeting an amount equal to or greater than at least two times the amount set aside at such school during the first year in which such school implemented participatory budgeting. The doubling of the amount to expend is considered to be a one time action, and the school will be required to expend the resulting amount each year until it is no longer a CSI school. Schools that are required to offer Public School Choice but were unable to do so and that instead fulfilled the annual participatory budgeting requirement identified in this subdivision through increasing opportunities for parent and student engagement as prescribed by the Commissioner will be required to provide additional opportunities for increased parent and student engagement in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner. (iv)\n\nFor any CSI school that is required to offer public school choice or increase the amount expended for Participatory Budgeting as outlined in clause (g) of subparagraph (iii), that school shall continue to provide all students enrolled in the school with public school choice during the period the school is identified as a CSI school. For schools that were unable to offer to public school choice as outlined in clause (g) of subparagraph (iii), and have fulfilled the annual participatory budgeting requirement described in this subdivision through an alternate means of increasing opportunities for parent and student engagement prescribed by the Commissioner will be required to continue to provide additional opportunities for increased parent and student engagement as outlined in clause (g) of subparagraph (iii) for each year the school is identified as a CSI school. If a school's designation as a CSI school is removed, the school shall no longer be required to provide all students in the school with public school choice in the following school year: provided further that any student receiving public school choice at the time the CSI designation is removed, shall continue to be provided the opportunity to remain in the school to which they have transferred and be provided with transportation until the student has completed the highest grade level in the school to which such students have transferred, in the manner required by the provisions of section\n120.3\nof this Part. (v) Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, a school district, on behalf of a transfer high school that has been identified as a CSI school, may petition the Commissioner to differentiate the required interventions for such transfer high school. Such petition may include, but need not be limited to, a request for one or more of the following: (a) the school comprehensive education plan shall be subject to\napproval\nonly by the district: (b) a transfer high school shall not be required to offer public school choice: (c) a transfer high school shall not be required to amend its school comprehensive education plan to partner with a BOCES, Regional Bilingual Educational Resource Network, Teacher Center, or other Regional Technical Assistance Center or other technical assistance provider as determined by the Commissioner to support the implementation of its school comprehensive education plan.

Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (j) of this section, the Commissioner shall use the following procedures to exit schools from identification for CSI, ATSI, TSI, and from Target District status based on 2021-2022, 2022-2023, or 2023-2024 school year results. (i) For elementary/middle schools: (a) For schools identified for CSI or ATSI, an increase between the school's performance in the 2021-2022 year compared to the 2017-2018 school year, or the 2022-2023 year compared to the 2021-2022 school year, based on either the Core Subject Performance Index or the Weighted Average Achievement Index for the identified subgroup. Provided, however, that an elementary/middle school may not exit CSI or ATSI status if the school is identified for CSI or ATSI using 2021-2022 school year results or meets the CSI identification criteria in the 2023-2024 school year based on 2022-2023 school year results. (b) Beginning with the 2023-2024 school year results, a school identified for CSI and ATSI may exit status if there is an increase in performance for two consecutive years on either the Core Subject Performance Index or the Weighted Average Achievement Index. Provided, however, that an elementary/middle school may not exit CSI or ATSI status if the school meets the criteria for identification as CSI or ATSI. (c) For schools identified for TSI, the school is not identified for TSI using the 2021-2022 or 2022-2023 school year results. (d) Beginning with the 2023-2024 school year results, a school identified for TSI may exit status if the school does not meet the TSI criteria for two consecutive years. (ii)\n\nFor high schools: (a) For schools identified for CSI or ATSI, an increase between the school's performance in the 2021-2022 school year compared to the 2017-2018 school year, or the 2023-2024 year compared to the 2021-2022 school year, based on the Weighted Average Achievement Index or the unweighted average of the Four-Year, Five-Year, and Six-Year Graduation Rates computed pursuant to clause (f)(2)(i)(b) of this section for the identified subgroup. Provided, however, that a high school may not exit CSI or ATSI status if the school is identified for CSI or ATSI using 2021-2022 school year results or meets the CSI or ATSI identification criteria in the 2023-2024 school year based on 2022-2023 school year results.

For schools identified for CSI for having Graduation Rate less than 67%, the school must have a Graduation Rate at or above 67% for two consecutive years to exit CSI status. Provided, however, that a high school may not exit CSI or ATSI status if the school meets the criteria for identification as CSI or ATSI.

(v) Notwithstanding the provision of subparagraph (j)(6)(ii) of this section, a Target District shall no longer be identified as a Target District if there is no school identified for CSI, ATSI, or TSI in the district. (6)\n\nIdentification of schools for public school registration review. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (k) and (l) of this section, the Commissioner shall neither place any schools under preliminarily registration review or registration review nor place any school into independent receivership based on 2021-2022 school year results.
