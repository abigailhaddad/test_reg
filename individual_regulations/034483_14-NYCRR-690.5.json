(iv)\n\nThe coordinator\nat the person's residential facility, if applicable, or case manager shall also\nbe invited to attend and participate in all interdisciplinary treatment team\nmeetings. (4)\n\nThe\ninitial individual program plan shall be developed by an interdisciplinary\ntreatment team which shall: (i) review current\nassessments and/or an existing individual program plan, if available. Assessments or plans developed within twelve months by another agency or\ncertified facility prior to enrollment shall be considered acceptable, based on\nreview and approval by the interdisciplinary treatment team; and\n(ii)\nin the absence of current and acceptable\nassessments and/or an individual program plan, conduct a preliminary screening\nof the person.

These plans shall contain, as appropriate, specific medical\nprescriptions or written direction (\ni.e., interventions, (see\nglossary). These plans shall contain, as appropriate, specific medical\nprescriptions or written direction (\ni.e., interventions, methodologies or strategies) from the interdisciplinary treatment team for all\nspecified services. Such services, interventions, and methodologies shall be\ndescribed in terms sufficiently clear to be understood by all parties\nparticipating in the implementation of the individual program plan. (7)\n\nThe day treatment facility\nshall provide to each person a range of allowable services to meet that\nperson's needs, as identified by the comprehensive functional assessment, and\nwhich are directed toward the acquisition of the behaviors and skills necessary\nfor the person to function with as much self determination and independence as\npossible, including, as appropriate, the prevention or deceleration of\nregression or loss of current optimal functional status. The outcomes (see\nglossary) to be achieved shall ensure promoting achievement of the following\noverall values, to the greatest extent possible: (i) independence - the person has\nopportunities to develop capacities that lessen his/her dependence; (ii)\ninclusion - the person has opportunities\nto engage in experiences and activities with those who are not\ndisabled; (iii)\nindividualization -\nthe person's self-esteem is developed by ensuring respect, by giving him/her\nmeaningful choices, and by providing services in terms of his/her unique and\nvalued individuality; and\n(iv)\nproductivity - the person is provided opportunities to make an increasingly\nmeaningful contribution to his/her living and community environment.

(iv)\n\nThe physician shall review and sign all\nreviews for those persons who are self-injurious, require daily individual\nattention from health care staff, or for whom a physician has determined that\nthere is the need for a physician's review and sign-off due to medication\nregimen, physical condition, etc. (e) Day treatment services to persons\nresiding in ICF/DDs. The following provisions, applicable to persons who reside in\nOPWDD certified or operated intermediate care facilities for persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities (ICF/DDs) and who are receiving services from a day\ntreatment facility, shall be met: (1)\n\nThe day treatment facility is responsible for providing during the day, a\nprogram of services, activities, and interventions, which are integrated and\nconsistent with the person's overall individual program plan, developed\npursuant to applicable ICF/DD regulations as referenced in Part 681 of this\n\nTitle.
