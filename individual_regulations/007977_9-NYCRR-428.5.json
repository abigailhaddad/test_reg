(b) Except as provided in section\n428.4\n(c) of this Part a request for an eligibility determination shall be made at a\nreasonable time prior to the implementation of the undertaking. The\ncommissioner, after notifying the APO in accordance with the provisions of\nsubdivision (d) of this section, will determine on a case-by-case basis what\nconstitutes a reasonable time, and this determination shall be\nconclusive. (c) The request, whether made by an APO or an interested party, shall be accompanied by\nsufficient information concerning the property for the commissioner to make an\ninformed and reasoned determination of eligibility.

The commissioner may ask the APO to submit a completed PRDS or any\nother information relating to the undertaking and give the APO an opportunity\nto comment on the request. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
