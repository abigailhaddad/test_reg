  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 151-4.1 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Special Disability Fund (\"SDF\") reimburses carriers and self-insured employers for all payments properly paid in accordance with Workers' Compensation Law sections 15(8) and 14(6). Specifically, where an employee with a \"permanent physical impairment\" incurs a subsequent disability as a result of a work-related injury or occupational disease that results in a permanent disability caused by both conditions combined, to a degree greater than what would have resulted from the second injury or occupational disease alone, the employer or carrier is reimbursed from the SDF for all benefits incurred after the first 260 weeks of disability. If the employee suffered the second injury before August 1, 1994, then the employer or carrier is reimbursed from the SDF for all benefits incurred after the first 104 weeks of the second injury. Further, if the second injury results in the employee's death, which would not have occurred except for the pre-existing permanent physical impairment, the employer or carrier is entitled to be reimbursed from the SDF for all benefits payable in excess of 260 weeks (or 104 weeks for accidents or disablements before August 1, 1994). The SDF funds its operations and claims payments by making annual assessments on insurers writing workers' compensation insurance in New York, self-insured employers (including political subdivisions), group self-insurers, and the State Insurance Fund. The combination of increasing requests for reimbursement from SDF, as well as the SDF's assessment funding mechanism, has resulted in a burden on New York State insurers and employers. In fact, assessments on insurers have increased by nearly 160 percent from 1999 to 2008, resulting in increased premium charges to employers. The Legislature enacted chapter 6 of the Laws of 2007, which amended Workers' Compensation Law section 15(8)(h), in order to close the SDF to claims for reimbursement for injuries or illnesses occurring on or after July 1, 2007, and to mandate that all claims for reimbursement be filed with the SDF prior to July 10, 2010. The legislation also amends Workers' Compensation Law section 32(i) to permit the chair of the Workers' Compensation Board to procure one or more private entities to assume the liability for, and management, administration or settlement of all or a portion of the claims in the special disability fund. Furthermore, Workers' Compensation Law, section 32(i)(5) mandates that no carrier, self-insured employer, or the State Insurance Fund may assume the liability for, management, administration or settlement of any claims on which it holds reserves, beyond such reserves as are permitted by regulation of the Superintendent of Financial Services. This purpose of this Subpart is to ensure than an insurer, self-insured employer, or State Insurance Fund does not over-reserve for claims if it voluntarily assumes the liability for, or management, administration or settlement.
