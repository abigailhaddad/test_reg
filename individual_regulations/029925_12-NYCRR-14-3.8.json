  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-3.8 - Welding repairs of cracks\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Removal of defects. A repair of a defect, such as a crack in a welded joint or\nbase material, may not be made until the defect has been removed. A suitable\nnondestructive examination method shall be used to assure complete removal of\nthe defect. If the defect penetrates the full thickness of the material, the\nrepair shall be made with a complete penetration weld such as a double butt\nweld or a single butt weld with or without backing. Note: Before repairing a cracked area, care should be\ntaken to investigate its cause and to determine its extent. Where circumstances\nindicate that the crack is likely to recur, consideration should be given to\nremoving the cracked area and installing a patch or other corrective\nmeasures. (b) Cracks in\nunstayed areas. Cracks in unstayed shells, drums or headers of boilers may be\nrepaired by welding, provided the cracks do not extend between rivet holes in a\nlongitudinal seam or parallel to a rivet seam within eight inches, measured\nfrom the nearest caulking edge. The total length may be welded, provided the\ncomplete repair is radiographed and stress relieved in accordance with section\n14-3.15\nof this Subpart. Cracks in\nunstayed areas shall be repaired as specified in figure 14-3.8(2) or by other\nequivalent methods. (c) Cracks in\nunstayed furnaces. Cracks of any length in unstayed boiler furnaces may be\nwelded provided the welds are thermally stress relieved in accordance with\nsection\n14-3.15\nof this Subpart. Welds\napplied from one side only shall be subject to the approval of the inspector. Field repair of cracks at the knuckle or the turn of the flange of the furnace\nopening require immediate replacement of the affected area. See Figure 14-3.8\n(1) which follows: FIGURE 14-3.8(1)--UNSTAYED BOILER FURNACES\nImage\n(d) Cracks between tube holes in water-tube\nboiler drums or in wrought or cast steel (but not cast iron) sectional headers\nmay be repaired by welding, provided the plate thickness does not exceed one\ninch and further provided that there are no more than two such cracks in any\none row in any direction, nor more than a total of four such cracks in any one\ndrum or header. The tubes on each side of a cracked ligament shall be removed\nbefore any welding is done, and after the welding is completed, the tube holes\nshall be reamed or otherwise properly prepared for reinstallation of the\ntubes. (e) Cracks in plain\ncircular, corrugated, Adamson ring or similar type furnaces may be repaired by\nwelding, provided they are locally stress relieved as required by section\n14-3.15\nof this Subpart. (f) Cracks in the flat portion of tube sheets\nadjacent to furnaces in Scotch marine boilers require immediate replacement of\nthe affected area. (g) Prior to\nrepairing a crack between tube holes in a boiler, the tubes at each end of the\ncrack shall be removed and, if considered necessary by the inspector, additional tubes shall be removed. When the welding is completed, the tube\nholes shall be reamed or otherwise properly prepared for reinstallation of the\ntubes. (h) Circumferential cracks\nin the knuckle or turn of a flange of a furnace or flue opening or adjacent to\na manhole opening of an unstayed head require immediate replacement of the\naffected area. FIGURE 14-3.8(2)--RIVET AND STAYBOLD HOLE CRACKS\nImage\n(i) Cracks radiating from rivet or staybolt\nholes may be repaired if the plate is not seriously damaged. If the plate is\nseriously damaged, it shall be replaced. The repair method shall be as follows: (1)\n\nPrior to welding, the rivets or staybolts\nfrom which the cracks extend and the adjacent rivets or staybolts shall be\nremoved. (2)\n\nIn riveted joints, tack bolts shall be replaced in alternate holes to hold the plate laps\nfirmly. (3)\n\nThe cracks shall then\nbe prepared for welding by chipping, grinding or gouging. (4)\n\nIn riveted joints, cracks which extend\npast the inner edge of the plate lap shall be welded from both sides. (5)\n\nRivet holes shall be reamed before new\nrivets are driven. (6)\n\nThreaded\nstaybolt holes shall be retapped and new staybolts properly driven and\nheaded. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-3.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
