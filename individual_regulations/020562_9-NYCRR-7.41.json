  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7.41 - Executive order. no. 41: requiring further environmental review of high-volume hydraulic fracturing in the marcellus shale\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the 2009 New York State Energy Plan supports the\ndevelopment of in-State energy resources, including natural gas, to achieve the\n\nPlan's multiple public policy objectives; and\nWHEREAS, low-volume hydraulic fracturing, or conventional\nfracking, has been used successfully and safely in New York State for many\nyears to extract natural gas consistent with the Generic Environmental Impact\n\nStatement (GEIS) for Oil, Gas and Solution Mining Regulatory Program\npromulgated by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation\n(Department) in 1992; and\nWHEREAS, new technologies have emerged, and are being\ndeployed in other states, to extract natural gas more efficiently through a\nprocess known as high-volume hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal\ndrilling; and\nWHEREAS, there is a need for further study of this new\ntechnology prior to deployment in New York State; and\nWHEREAS, in 2008, I directed the Commissioner of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation to initiate a formal public process to update the\n1992 GEIS to ensure that any new technologies deployed in New York State are\nfirst thoroughly analyzed and regulated to ensure that all environmental and\npublic health impacts are mitigated or avoided; and\nWHEREAS, the Department issued a draft scope for an updated\nGEIS on October 6, 2008, held public meetings in the Marcellus shale region, received more than 3,000 written comments, and issued a final scope for the\n\nSupplemental Generic Environmental Impact Statement (SGEIS) on February 6, 2009. The Department released the Draft SGEIS for public review and comment on\n\nSeptember 30, 2009, held four public hearings in the region and New York City, and received more than 13,000 written comments during a public comment period\nthat closed December 31, 2009; and\nWHEREAS, tens of thousands of citizens, landowners, local\ngovernments, large and small businesses, non-governmental organizations, and\nother stakeholders have expressed their heartfelt support for or opposition to\nthe new technology, but most agree that an objective, science-based analysis is\nthe best approach to setting new policy. NOW, THEREFORE, I, David A. Paterson, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nlaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: 1. The Department shall complete its review\nof the public comments, make such revisions to the Draft SGEIS that are\nnecessary to analyze comprehensively the environmental impacts associated with\nhigh-volume hydraulic fracturing combined with horizontal drilling, ensure that\nsuch impacts are appropriately avoided or mitigated consistent with the State\n\nEnvironmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA), other provisions of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law and other laws, and ensures that adequate regulatory measures\nare identified to protect public health and the environment; and\n2. On or about June 1, 2011, the Department\nshall publish a Revised Draft SGEIS, accept public comment on the revisions for\na period of not less than thirty days, and may schedule public hearings on such\nrevisions to be conducted in the Marcellus shale region and New York City; and\n3. Recognizing that, pursuant\nto SEQRA, no permits may be issued prior to the completion of a Final SGEIS, the Department, subsequent to the conclusion of the public comment period, shall report to the Governor on the status of the Final SGEIS and the\nregulatory conditions that are necessary to include in oil and gas well permits\nto protect public health and the environment. Signed: David A. PatersonDated: December 13, 2010\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n7.41\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
