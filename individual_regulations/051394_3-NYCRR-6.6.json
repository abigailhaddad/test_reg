  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 6.6 - Exemption from requirements of banking law, section 7010 concerning mandated number of meetings of boards of directors and executive committees of banks and trust companies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Banking Board hereby finds that the\npromulgation of this section is consistent with the policy of the State of New\n\nYork as declared in section 10 of the New York Banking Law and thereby protects\nthe public interest, including the interests of depositors, creditors, shareholders, stockholders and consumers and is necessary to achieve or\nmaintain parity between banks and trust companies and national banks with\nrespect to rights, powers, privileges, benefits, activities, loans, investments\nor transactions. (b) The Banking\n\nBoard hereby finds that section 7010 of the New York Banking Law mandates for\neach State-chartered bank and trust company that its board of directors must\nhold a regular monthly meeting at least 10 times a year and, during any three\nconsecutive calendar months, the board must meet at least twice, and that its\nexecutive committee shall meet at least once in each 30-day period during which\nthe board does not meet. (c) The\n\nBanking Board hereby finds that there are no provisions contained in Subchapter\nIII --Directors, title 12, United States Code, sections\n71\n-\n78, which require a national bank's board of directors to hold a specified number\nof meetings per annum, or which require executive committee meetings in the\nabsence of a board meeting. (d) The\n\nBanking Board hereby finds that title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, section\n7.2000(b) provides that to the extent not inconsistent with applicable Federal\nbanking statutes or regulations, or bank safety and soundness, a national bank\nmay elect to follow the corporate governance procedures of the law of the state\nin which the main office of the bank is located, the law of the state in which\nthe holding company of the bank is incorporated, the Delaware General\n\nCorporation Law, Delaware Code Ann. title 8 (1991, as amended 1994, and as\namended thereafter) or the Model Business Corporation Act (1984, as amended\n1994, as amended thereafter) and that such national bank shall designate in its\nbylaws the body of law selected for its corporate governance\nprocedures. (e) The Banking Board\nhereby finds that certain national banks which maintain their main offices in\n\nNew York have not elected to follow the corporate governance procedures of New\n\nYork, and finds further that the lack of any mandate to do so together act to\nplace State-chartered banks and trust companies at a competitive disadvantage\nin finding qualified individuals to serve on their boards of\ndirectors. (f) The Banking Board\nhereby finds that if a State-chartered bank or trust company is well\ncapitalized (as defined in 12 C.F.R. section\n325.103\n[b][1]), well managed (as\ndefined in\n12\nC.F.R. section\n362.17\n[e]) or, in the case of\na non-depository institution, is in satisfactory condition as determined upon\nexamination by the superintendent, and has been in existence for more than five\nyears, unless the superintendent, in his/her discretion, provides otherwise, its board of directors shall hold a regular meeting not less than six times a\nyear, provided that during any three consecutive calendar months the board\nshall meet at least once, and its executive committee shall not be required to\nmeet at least once in each 30-day period during which the board does not\nmeet. (g) The Banking Board hereby\nfinds that in circumstances where one or more of the required criteria set\nforth in subdivision (f) of this section are not present to enable a board of\ndirectors of a bank to conduct a minimum of six regular meetings, the board\nshall conduct no less than 10 regular meetings, and the executive committee\nshall meet at least once in each 30-day period during which the board does not\nmeet, unless otherwise permitted by the superintendent upon application; and in\nso acting the superintendent shall take into account all of the circumstances\nsurrounding such application, including the principles of safety and\nsoundness. (h) The Banking Board\nhereby determines that qualified State-chartered banks and trust companies are\nhereby exempt from the requirement contained in section\n7010\nof the\n\nBanking Law which requires that for each State-chartered bank and trust company\nits board of directors shall hold a regular monthly meeting at least 10 times a\nyear and its executive committee shall meet at least once in each 30-day period\nduring which the board does not meet.
