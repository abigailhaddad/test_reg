Verification of such rents\ncan be made by checking rent receipts, cancelled checks, and obtaining\ninformation from previous landlord. If previous rents are considered\ninequitable, either to tenant or to authority (as may occur when tenant is a\nrelative of previous landlord), or if there was no previous rent established, as in the case of owner-occupied home, the authority shall establish equitable\nrents subject to division approval. (b) Rents should not include utilities such\nas heat, gas and electricity, unless conditions such as a central heating\nsystem or a single meter necessitate their inclusion. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1626-1.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
