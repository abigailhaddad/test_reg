  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 79.26 - Vehicles subject to diesel emissions inspection\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nAll nonexempt diesel-powered motor\nvehicles, that have a maximum gross weight (MGW) over 8,500 pounds, are\nregistered in the NYMA, and are not subject to the OBD II emissions inspection, are subject to a test of the vehicle exhaust emissions (smoke opacity test) as\npart of the annual vehicle inspection. A vehicle required to have an exhaust\nemissions inspection under these regulations may be inspected only at an\nofficial diesel emissions inspection station. No other classification of\ninspection station may conduct inspections for vehicles requiring diesel\nemissions inspection unless a temporary certificate of emissions waiver (form\nVS-1078) has been issued for the vehicle and is presented to the inspection\nstation. Upon the vehicle's re-entry into the NYMA, a complete diesel\nsafety/emissions inspection must be performed. (2)\n\nNon-NYMA. (i) All diesel-powered motor vehicles that\nhave a maximum gross weight (MGW) over 8,500 pounds, and that are registered\noutside the NYMA are exempt from the diesel emissions inspection. If the\nvehicle is not subject to an OBD II emissions inspection, the motorist may\nrequest a diesel emissions inspection (smoke opacity test) by presenting the\nvehicle to an official diesel emissions station and requesting the\ninspection. (ii)\n\nIf a nonexempt\ndiesel-powered vehicle that has a maximum gross weight (MGW) over 8,500 pounds\nwith a registration from another state, or with a New York State registration\nwith an out-of-state address, is presented for inspection in the NYMA, the\nvehicle must receive a safety and diesel emissions inspection (smoke opacity\ntest), and must be issued a diesel safety/emissions inspection certificate if\nit passes the inspection unless the vehicle is subject to an OBD II emissions\ninspection. (b) Pre-emission inspection\ncheck\n(1)\n\nEach vehicle subject to the\ndiesel emissions (smoke opacity) test will first be visually inspected for the\nfollowing conditions: (i) Exhaust system -\nmission section or holes which would prohibit collection of exhaust\nsample. (ii)\n\nIf the vehicle was\noriginally equipped with a governor, determine that it is not missing, disconnected, or malfunctioning. (2)\n\nVehicles found having any of the\nconditions set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall not be\ninspected. This refusal shall not constitute an inspection, no inspection fee\nshall be charged, and the station shall instruct the motorist that the vehicle\nmust be returned in a repaired condition in order for an inspection to be\nperformed. (c) Standards. (1)\n\nThe New York State\n\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation in consultation with the Department of\n\nMotor Vehicles shall establish and modify periodically the standards of diesel\nemissions allowable in the exhaust emissions of vehicles subject to the diesel\nexhaust emissions (smoke opacity) test. (2)\n\nThe test limits established by the New\n\nYork State Department of Environmental Conservation in 6 NYCRR Part\n217\nmust be\nused when performing a diesel emissions (smoke opacity) test. (d) Diesel emissions test\nprocedure. Subject vehicles registered in the NYMA will receive this\ntest. The test will, in general, consist of entering appropriate vehicle data\non the form VS-1074SA, and obtaining a sample of the vehicle's exhaust per the\nequipment manufacturer's instructions. The system will measure the exhaust\nparticulates and indicate if the vehicle has passed or failed the emissions\ntest. The system will print out the results and a copy of the print out must be\ngiven to the customer. The inspection station must also retain a copy of the\ntest results, which will be attached to the motor vehicle inspection record\n(VS-1074SD). An emissions test will be considered invalid if the vehicle\ninspection system indicates an invalid test reading. In addition, vehicles\nsubject to the diesel emissions inspection are also subject to the procedures\nin subdivision (g) of this section. (e) Effect of failure of diesel\nemissions test. Subject vehicles must pass the safety inspection and the\nemissions test in order for any inspection certificate to be issued. If the\nvehicle fails to pass either the emissions test or the safety inspection, or\ncombination, an inspection rejection notice must be given to the operator. A\ncertificate of inspection cannot be issued until appropriate repairs are made\nto reduce the exhaust emissions level within the test limits or until\nappropriate repairs are made to the failed safety inspection items or both or\nuntil it qualifies for a diesel emissions waiver (VS-1079DE). The cost to\nrepair safety items does not count towards the emissions waiver cost\nlimit. (f) Diesel\nemissions reinspection procedure and fees. If a vehicle fails a safety and/or diesel emissions\ninspection, and is not removed from the station for repair, these shall be no\ncharge for reinspection of such vehicle. If a vehicle fails both the safety and\ndiesel emissions portions of the inspection, and is removed from the inspection\nstation for repairs, the inspection station or any other inspection station\nmust conduct a full inspection during the reinspection of the vehicle. If a\nvehicle fails the safety portion of an inspection but passes the diesel\nemissions portion, and is removed from the inspection station for repairs, and\nis brought back to the same inspection station within 30 days, the inspection\nstation shall conduct only the safety portion of the inspection and must charge\nonly the safety portion of the inspection fee as set forth in section\n79.7\n(c) of this\n\nPart. If a vehicle passes the safety portion of the inspection but fails the\ndiesel emissions portion, and is removed from the inspection station for\nrepairs, and is brought to the same inspection station within 30 days, the\ninspection station shall conduct only the diesel emissions portion of the\ninspection and must charge only the diesel emissions portion of the inspection\nfee as set forth in section\n79.7\n(c) of this\n\nPart. An inspection station to which a vehicle is presented for reinspection\nmore than 30 days after rejection must perform a full inspection. If a vehicle\nis presented for reinspection to a station other than the station that rejected\nthe vehicle, a full inspection must be performed. (g) Emissions control devices. Vehicles subject to the diesel emissions inspection program\nmust be inspected for the presence and condition of devices designed to control\ndiesel emissions. The vehicle must be rejected if any such device is missing, disconnected, or disabled. The certified motor vehicle inspector shall inspect\nthose emissions control devices that the motor vehicle was originally equipped\nwith by the manufacturer, and those emissions control devices that have been\nretrofitted into the motor vehicle in accordance with State or Federal laws or\nregulations. (h) Diesel emissions inspection waiver. (1)\n\nIf a vehicle fails, after proper repair, the reinspection of the emissions portion, a certificate of inspection must be\noffered by the official diesel emissions inspection station if all of the\nfollowing conditions are met: (i) The safety\ninspection has been passed. (ii)\n\nAll emissions control devices have passed inspection. The cost for replacement\nof missing emissions control devices or warranty repairs does not count towards\nthe emissions waiver cost limits. The cost to repair safety items does not\ncount towards the emissions waiver cost limit. (iii)\n\nEmissions repairs and adjustments have\nbeen properly made and documented and the cost equals or exceeds the value\ncontained in the table below for the proper maximum gross weight (MGW)\ncategory. The waiver amounts in the table may be adjusted to account for\nincreases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Minimum hardship waiver\nrepair costs by MGW\nMGW\nMinimum repair cost\nfor waiver\n8,501 to 18,000 lbs\n$1,000\n18,001 to 26,000 lbs\n$2,000\n\nOver 26,000 lbs\n$4,000\n(2)\n\nIf all of the above conditions are met, the inspector will be allowed to issue the inspection certificate(s) for the\nvehicle. Check the \"repair waiver issued\" box on the reverse side of the\n\"safety/diesel emissions\" sticker VS-1082D and punch the appropriate expiration\nmonth. The inspector must fill out a diesel emission inspection certification\nand waiver form (form VS-1079DE), and that form, along with copies of the\nrepair invoices verifying that the required repairs have been performed, must\nbe retained by the station for a period of two years. Copies of all the above\ndocuments and a copy of form VS-1079DE must be mailed to the Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation (DEC) at the address on the form within three days\nof issuing the waiver. (3)\n\nThe\ncommissioner or an agent of the commissioner reserves the right to inspect a\nvehicle before or after the waiver is issued to verify that proper repairs have\nbeen made and the costs have been documented.
