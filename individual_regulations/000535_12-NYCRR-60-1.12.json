Tit. 12 §§ 60-1.12 - Insurer's duties and responsibilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The insurer shall apply each incentive\nthat is granted by the department and the superintendent to the employer's next\npolicy renewal period following the date of the department's approval\ncertificate. The implementation of the incentive for individually self-insured\nemployers will be subject to the annual renewal process required by Part 315 of\nthis Title. (b) If an employer\nobtains workers' compensation insurance from a different insurer than the\ninsurer that originally provided the employer its WSLPIP incentive, the new\ninsurer shall continue to apply the required incentive in accordance with the\nregulations established by the superintendent pursuant to section\n134\n(6)\nof the Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw. (c) The insurer providing a\ncredit pursuant to this Part shall report annually to the commissioner and the\nsuperintendent, in a form prescribed by the superintendent, the total number of\nemployers insured during the prior year that received a premium credit for each\nWSLPIP program, and the total amount of the credit provided by the\ninsurer. (d) For individually\nself-insured employers, the chair of the board shall maintain the information\nrequired by this Part and provide it to the commissioner and the superintendent\nupon request. However, for purposes of this Part, an individually self-insured\nemployer's \"premium credit\" refers to the employer's security deposit\nadjustment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
