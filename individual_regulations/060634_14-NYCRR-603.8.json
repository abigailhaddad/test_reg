Tit. 14 § 603.8 - Grounds for denial of access to records\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A request for a record may be denied for\nany of the following reasons: (1)\n\nThe record\nis exempted from disclosure by other State or Federal statute. Examples of\nstatutes which limit public access to records are: (i) section\n33.13\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law, which restricts access to information about individuals\n(see section\n603.13\n[b]\nof this\n\nPart), including identification of individuals and their clinical\nrecords; (ii)\nsection\n3101\n(d) of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, which restricts access to records prepared solely for purposes of litigation; and\n(iii)\nsections\n1306\nand\n1395bb\nof\ntitle 42 of the United States Code, which restrict public access\nto hospital survey reports prepared by the Joint Commission on the\n\nAccreditation of Hospitals (JCAH). (2)\n\nDisclosure of the record could impair\npresent or imminent contract awards or collective bargaining\nnegotiations. (3)\n\nThe record\ncontains trade secrets or is maintained for the regulation of commercial\nenterprise, and the disclosure of such record could cause substantial injury to\nthe competitive position of the subject enterprise. (4)\n\nThe record was complied for law\nenforcement purposes and disclosure could: (i) interfere with law enforcement investigations or judicial\nproceedings; (ii)\ndeprive a person\nof his or her right to a fair trial or impartial adjudication; (iii)\nidentify a confidential source or\ndisclose confidential information relating to a criminal investigation; or\n(iv)\nreveal nonroutine criminal\ninvestigative techniques or procedures. (5)\n\nDisclosure of the record could endanger\nthe life or safety of any person. If the records access officer has a concern\nthat such might be the case, he or she may require the requester to identify\nhimself or herself and state the reason why the record is being\nrequested. (6)\n\nThe record is\ninteragency or intra-agency materials, but not: (i) a statistical tabulation (see section\n603.13\n[g]\nof this\n\nPart) or factual tabulation (see section\n603.13\n[c]\n) or\ndata; (ii)\ninstructions to staff\nwhich affect the public; or\n(iii)\nfinal agency policy or determination. (7)\n\nDisclosure of the record would jeopardize\nan agency's capacity to guarantee the security of its information technology\nassets, such assets encompassing both electronic information systems and\ninfrastructures. (8)\n\nThe record\nconsists of examination questions or answers which are requested prior to final\nadministration of such questions. (9)\n\nThe record of the type described by the\nrequester does not exist. (b) Nothing in this Part shall require\ndisclosure of the name or home address of the following persons: (1)\napplicants for appointment to public\nemployment; or\n(2)\nbeneficiaries of\na public employees' retirement system. (c) Nothing in this Part shall require\ndisclosure of the home address of the following persons, unless such disclosure\nis to recognized employee organizations pursuant to section 89.7 of the Public\n\nOfficers Law: (1)\npresent or former officers\nor employees; or\n(2)\nretirees of a\npublic employees' retirement system. (d) A request for a record must be denied if: (1)\n\nDisclosure is prohibited under article\n6-A of the Public Officers Law, known as the Personal Privacy Protection\n\nLaw. (2)\n\nDisclosure would\nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. (i) An invasion of personal privacy includes, but is not limited to, any of the following: (a) disclosure of employment, medical or\ncredit histories or personal references of applicants for employment and\ncurrent employees; (b) disclosure\nof the medical or personal records of an individual receiving services or\napplicant for services of an OPWDD-operated and/or certified\nfacility; (c) sale or release of\nlists of names and addresses if such lists would be used for commercial or\nfundraising purposes. If the request is for a list of names and addresses, the\nrecords access officer may ask the requester to identify himself or herself and\nstate the purpose of the request; (d) disclosure of information of a personal\nnature when disclosure would result in economic or personal hardship to the\nsubject and when such information is not relevant to the work of OPWDD; or\n(e) disclosure of information of\na personal nature reported in confidence to OPWDD and not relevant to the\nordinary work of OPWDD. (ii)\n\nDisclosure shall not be construed to\nconstitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy: (a) when identifying details are deleted; or\n(b) when the person or persons\nto whom the record pertains consent to disclosure in writing; or\n(c) when, upon presenting reasonable proof of\nidentity, a person seeks access to records pertaining to himself or herself\nunder the provisions of the Personal Privacy Protection Law and Part 604 of\nthis Title. (iii)\n\nNotwithstanding the above, access to an individual's clinical records within\nthe scope of section\n33.13\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law shall be exclusively governed by such section of the\n\nMental Hygiene Law.
