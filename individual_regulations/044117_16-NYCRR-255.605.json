  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.605 - Essentials of operating and maintenance plan\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach operator shall include, as a minimum, the following\nin its operating and maintenance plan as applicable: (a) detailed instructions for employees\ncovering operating and maintenance procedures during normal operations and\nrepairs; (b) procedures required to\nbe included by the provisions of the welding, joining, corrosion control, upgrading, operations, maintenance, and accidents and leaks sections of this\n\nPart; (c) specific programs\nrelating to facilities presenting the greatest hazard to public safety either\nin an emergency or because of extraordinary construction or maintenance\nrequirements; (d) provision for\nperiodic inspections to ensure that operating pressures are appropriate for the\nclass location; (e) precautions to\nbe taken when excavation is performed in the vicinity of any underground gas\nfacility; (f) procedures to\ncorrect, within specified timeframes, deficiencies found during any\ninspections, evaluations, reviews, etc. required by this Part; (g) criteria employed to determine business\ndistricts for the purpose of compliance with section\n255.723\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Part; (h) criteria employed to\nidentify those conditions at leak hazard locations which necessitate that the\ninterval between surveillances be shortened; (i) details of how an operator plans to\ncomply with any requirement of this Part that is written in nonspecific\nlanguage. For example, section\n255.805\n(b) of\nthis Part states that \"Each operator shall.. establish a means by which it\ndetermines the appropriate surveillance interval at leak locations under frost\nconditions.. \" the details required by this subdivision would necessitate the\noperator to specify the established means; (j) instructions enabling personnel who\nperform operation and maintenance activities to recognize conditions that may\nbe safety-related conditions that are subject to the reporting requirements of\nsection\n255.831\nof this Part; (k) procedures for making construction\nrecords, maps, and operating history available to appropriate\npersonnel; (l) procedures for start\nup and shut down of any section of pipeline in a manner designed to assure\noperation within the maximum allowable operating pressure limits prescribed by\nthis Part, plus the build-up allowed for operation of pressure limiting and\ncontrol devices; (m) procedures for\nmaintaining compressor stations, including provisions for isolating units or\nsections of pipe and for purging before returning to service; (n) procedures for starting, operating, and\nshutting down gas compressor units; (o) procedures for periodic review of the\nwork done by operator personnel to determine the effectiveness and adequacy of\nthe procedures used in normal operation and maintenance and modifying the\nprocedures when deficiencies are found; (p) procedures for adequate precautions in\nexcavated trenches to protect personnel from the hazards of unsafe\naccumulations of vapor or gas, and making available when needed at the\nexcavation, emergency rescue equipment including a breathing apparatus and a\nrescue harness and line; (q) responding promptly to a report of a gas odor inside or near a building, unless\nthe operator's emergency procedures under section\n255.615\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Part specifically apply to these reports; and\n(r) for transmission lines, other than those\noperated in connection with the operator's distribution system, procedures for\nthe following to provide safety when operating design limits have been\nexceeded: (1)\nresponding to, investigating and\ncorrecting the cause of: (i) unintended\nclosure of valves, or shutdowns; (ii)\nincrease or decrease in pressure or flow\nrate outside normal operating limits; (iii)\nloss of communications; (iv)\noperation of any safety device; and\n(v) any other foreseeable\nmalfunction of component, deviation from normal operation, or personnel error\nwhich may result in a hazard to persons or property; (2)\nchecking variations from normal\noperation, after abnormal operation has ended, at sufficient critical locations\nin the system to determine continued integrity and safe operation; (3)\nnotifying responsible operator personnel\nwhen notice of an abnormal operation is received; (4)\nperiodically reviewing the response of\noperator personnel to determine the effectiveness of the procedures controlling\nabnormal operation and taking corrective action where deficiencies are\nfound; (s) implementing\nthe applicable control room management procedures required by section\n255.631\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.605\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
