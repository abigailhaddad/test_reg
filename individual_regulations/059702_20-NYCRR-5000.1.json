  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 5000.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\n\nCommissioner of Taxation and Finance, or such person as may be designated by\nthe commissioner, may compromise any civil liability arising from a tax or\nother imposition which is administered by the commissioner, prior to the time\nthe tax, other imposition or administrative action becomes finally and\nirrevocably fixed and is no longer subject to administrative review. The\n\nAttorney General may compromise any such liability after reference of a case to\nthe Department of Law for prosecution or defense, but prior to the time the\ntax, other imposition or the administrative action taken by the commissioner is\nno longer subject to judicial review. Any such liability may be compromised\nonly upon one or both of the following two grounds: (1)\ndoubt as to liability; or\n(2)\ndoubt as to collectibility or where\ncollection in full would cause an individual taxpayer undue economic hardship\n(see section\n5005.1\n[b][3]\nof this Title for information on undue economic hardship). (b) No such liability will be compromised\nunder this Part if the liability has been established by a valid warrant or\njudgment. (c) An offer in\ncompromise will not be accepted for any reason where acceptance of such an\noffer would undermine voluntary compliance with taxes or other impositions\nadministered by the commissioner or would not be in the best interests of the\n\nState. Factors indicating that an offer would undermine voluntary compliance or\nwould not be in the best interests of the State may include a taxpayer's\noverall history of noncompliance, a taxpayer's deliberate actions to evade\npayment, and a taxpayer's encouragement of others to refuse to comply with the\ntax laws. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n5000.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
