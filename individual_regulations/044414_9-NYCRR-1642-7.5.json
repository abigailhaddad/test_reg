  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-7.5 - Reconciliation of inventory accounts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where commodities, supplies and materials\nare charged in the first instance to an inventory account, the perpetual\ninventory will currently reflect the value of the inventory (on the first- in, first-out basis) as well as the physical quantities. The value of the inventory\nwill be furnished to the accounting section each month. This figure shall agree\nwith the net difference between the debits and credits to the general ledger\ninventory account during the month. Any difference between the balances should\nbe reconciled. (b) A physical\ninventory of commodity materials and supplies shall be taken at the end of each\nsix-month period (September 30th and March 31st) and checked against the\nperpetual inventory card balances. After the inventory card balances have been\nreconciled with the actual inventory, the accounting section will be furnished\nwith a listing of the reconciled card balances. The total of the listings shall\nbe compared with the general ledger inventory control accounts and every\nattempt shall be made to reconcile any differences which exist. When such\nreconciliation has been effected, the adjustment necessary to bring the general\nledger inventory account into agreement with the actual inventory balance shall\nbe made. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-7.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
