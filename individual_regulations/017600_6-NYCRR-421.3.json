Tit. 6 § 421.3 - Refusal to renew, suspension or revocation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The department may refuse to renew a\npermit, in whole or in part, upon a finding that the permittee is in repeated\nor willful violation of any of the terms of the permit; title 27; or any rule, regulation, standard or condition promulgated pursuant thereto. When the\ndepartment denies an application for renewal of a permit, the permit shall\nexpire as scheduled unless a hearing is requested by the permittee prior to\nsaid expiration date. In the latter case, the permit will be extended until a\ndate which an order of the department made after such hearing may provide. Such\nextension shall not be construed as condonation by the department of the\npermittee's actions prior to or during the extension period. (b) The department may suspend or revoke a\npermit, in whole or in part, upon a finding that the permittee is in repeated\nor willful violation of any of the terms of the permit, or provisions of title\n27, or for repeated or willful deviation from the mined land-use plan. Suspension or revocation of a permit shall become effective 15 days after the\nmailing or service of notice to the permittee unless a hearing requested by the\npermittee, in which case such action will be effective upon any date which an\norder of the department made after such hearing may provide.
