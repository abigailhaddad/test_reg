  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 13.1 - Transportation of dead human bodies by common carrier\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe transportation of dead bodies by common carrier, defined for the purposes of this Part as a carrier licensed or authorized to transport cargo by any of the following: New York State Department of Transportation; Interstate Commerce Commission; Federal Aviation Administration; or United States Coast Guard, shall be conducted in such manner as not to be a menace to health and shall conform to the following requirements: (a) Burial-transit permit required. A burial-transit permit issued by the local registrar of vital statistics must accompany each dead body transported by a common carrier. (b) Transportation of dead human bodies by common carrier. Transportation of dead bodies by common carrier shall be permitted only under the following conditions: (1)\ndead bodies shall be encased in a rigid container which is so constructed as to withstand hazards associated with the methods of transportation used. In order to prevent the leakage of body fluids either the dead body must be placed in a leak-proof pouch within the container, or the container must be leakproof or the container must be placed in a leak-proof container; and\n(2)\nall dead bodies shall be clothed or covered by a shroud or other body covering, all external body orifices shall be closed with absorbent cotton and a name tag affixed to the dead body giving the name of the deceased as it appears on the death certificate. (c) Exceptions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, a permit for the burial or cremation of human remains issued by the authorized agency of any municipality or county within the United States, of any State, territory or possession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or of any foreign state within whose jurisdiction the death or fetal death occurred, which specifies the cemetery or crematory, may be accepted by the person in charge of the cemetery or crematory in lieu of a permit issued by a registrar of vital statistics of this State. If a permit issued in another jurisdiction does not specify the cemetery or crematory, or if the cemetery or crematory specified is not the actual place of intended burial or cremation, it shall not be accepted by the person in charge of a cemetery or crematory, but shall be exchanged for a permit issued by the registrar of vital statistics in the registration district where the burial or cremation of the remains was originally intended.
