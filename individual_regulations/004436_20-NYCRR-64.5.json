  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 64.5 - Bonds or other security\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 422, 423, 431(3)\n(a) The Department of Taxation and Finance\nmay require any distributor of alcoholic beverages to file or deposit and\nmaintain with the department: (1)\na bond\nissued by a surety company which is (i) authorized to transact business in New\n\nYork State; (ii) registered with and under the supervision of the Insurance\n\nDepartment of New York State; and (iii) approved by the Superintendent of\n\nInsurance as to solvency and responsibility; or\n(2)\nsuch other acceptable security enumerated\nin subdivision (c) of this section. Such bond or security must be in such amount as the\ndepartment may require to secure the payment of any liability of such\ndistributor pursuant to article 18 of the Tax Law. A bond or acceptable\nsecurity may be required to be filed or deposited with the department before a\ndistributor is registered or at any time thereafter and such bond or security\nis subject to being increased at any time it is deemed necessary as a\nprotection to the revenues under article 18 of the Tax Law. (b) (1)\n\nPrior to the approval of an application\nfor registration as a distributor of alcoholic beverages or during any\nsubsequent review of a registered distributor, the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance, in determining the need for and the amount or sufficiency of a bond, may: (i) require and analyze an estimated\nsix-month tax liability of the applicant or of the distributor based on\nanticipated or representative sales and uses of alcoholic beverages and the\ntypes of alcoholic beverages at issue; (ii)\nrequire and analyze current financial\nstatements of the applicant or distributor which have been independently\ncertified as to reliability by a licensed public accountant or by a certified\npublic accountant pursuant to an audit conducted by such accountant, with\nparticular emphasis on the ratio of current assets to current liabilities and\nnet worth (total assets less total liabilities) as determined in accordance\nwith generally accepted accounting principles; (iii)\nevaluate any independent information\nconcerning an applicant's or distributor's nature of operations, reliability, overall financial status, liquidity, or history of financial solvency and\nstability; and\n(iv)\nreview the\ntaxpayer's compliance record to determine whether there are or were any\ndelinquencies in filing returns and/or payment of taxes as an alcoholic\nbeverage distributor or for any other taxes due New York State for which the\napplicant or distributor may be or may have been responsible. (2)\n(i) Current financial\nstatements\nas used in this paragraph means certified financial\nstatements for a 12-month period of time ended not more than 18 months prior to\nthe date such statements are submitted to the department. Where such certified\nfinancial statements are for a period ended more than six months prior to the\ndate of submission, in addition to such certified financial statements, interim\nfinancial statements (on a monthly, quarterly or yearly basis) must be\nsubmitted to the department for a period of time ending within such six-month\nperiod. All financial statements submitted to the department must reflect the\nindividual activities of the applicant or of the distributor, as the case may\nbe. Where a certification is applicable to a consolidated group of entities, the financial spreadsheets upon which the certification was based, together\nwith an analysis of all intercompany accounts, must also be provided. The\ndepartment may require an unqualified opinion in support of such statements\nwhere it deems such an opinion necessary. (ii)\n\nIf an applicant or a distributor fails\nto supply current financial statements which have been independently certified\nby a licensed public accountant or by a certified public accountant and/or\nfails to supply an unqualified opinion where necessary in support of such\nstatements, as required by this subdivision, the applicant will not be\nregistered or such distributor's registration will be cancelled. However, on\npetition, either through the hearing process or on the motion of the\ndepartment, the requirements for a certification by a licensed public\naccountant or by a certified public accountant and for an unqualified\nsupporting opinion may be waived. If such requirements are waived, the\ndepartment may instead require alternative certification or require the\napplicant or distributor to file a bond in such amount as is deemed\nappropriate, regardless of the net worth or financial status of the applicant\nor distributor. (3)\n\nIn\ngeneral and provided there is no information which would indicate otherwise, an\napplicant or a distributor will be, or will not be, required to file and\nmaintain with the department a bond pursuant to the provisions of this\nparagraph. Provided further, unless the applicant, distributor or the\ndepartment can establish otherwise, to negate valuation considerations (\ne.g., cost-to-market, intangibles, collectibility of\nreceivables, intercompany accounts, etc.) only 80 percent of net worth shall be\nrecognized for purposes of determining the amount of a bond. (i) Generally, if an applicant's or a\ndistributor's ratio of current assets to current liabilities (current ratio) is\nat least one-to-one and 80 percent of the net worth is equal to or greater than\nthe six-month tax liability, a bond will not be required. (ii)\n\nGenerally, if an applicant's or a\ndistributor's current ratio is at least one-to-one and 80 percent of the net\nworth is less than the six-month tax liability, a bond will be required for the\ndifference between 80 percent of the net worth and the six-month tax\nliability. (iii)\n\nGenerally, if an\napplicant's or a distributor's current ratio is less than one-to-one and 80\npercent of the net worth is equal to or greater than the six-month tax\nliability, a bond will be required for one third of the six-month tax\nliability. (iv)\n\nGenerally, if an\napplicant's or a distributor's current ratio is less than one-to-one and 80\npercent of the net worth is less than the six-month tax liability, a bond will\nbe required for the greater of: (a) the\ndifference between 80 percent of the net worth and the six-month tax liability; or\n(b) one third of such six-month\ntax liability. (v) Generally, the amount of a bond shall not exceed the estimated or\nrepresentative six-month tax liability of the applicant or of the distributor. Where the six-month tax liability cannot be determined, for example where the\napplicant or distributor is unable to furnish an average monthly amount of\nalcoholic beverages sold or used within the State, the amount of a bond\nrequired to be filed and maintained with the department may be fixed by the\ndepartment on any reasonable basis. (vi)\n\nIn addition to subparagraphs (i) through\n(v) of this paragraph, the amount of a bond required, if any, may be adjusted\nwhere any information indicates the need for a bond in greater or lesser\namount. (c) (1)\n\nIn lieu of the bond referred to in\nsubdivision (b) of this section, an applicant or distributor may deposit with\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance other security, approved by the\ndepartment, in such amounts as it may require. Among the kinds of security\nwhich may be acceptable are the following: (i) certificated United States Treasury Bonds; (ii)\ncertificated bonds of New York\n\nState; (iii)\ncertificated bonds of\nany political subdivision of New York State having general governmental powers\nand in connection with which the credit of the political subdivision is pledged\nfor the payment of the interest and principal due on such bonds; (iv)\nfinancial institution passbooks and\ncertificates of deposit; (v) irrevocable standby letters of credit made payable to the New York State\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance; and\n(vi)\nany other forms of security acceptable\nto the Department of Taxation and Finance. (2)\n(i) Bonds offered as collateral under this subdivision must be certificated and may\nbe either bearer or registered bonds, having maturity dates at least five years\nsubsequent to the date of deposit with the Department of Taxation and Finance. The amount of the bonds will generally be based on the fair market value, not\nto exceed par value on maturity, determined as of the date of deposit. If such\nbonds are of the coupon type, the interest coupons must be attached. Certificated registered bonds offered as collateral must be in the name of the\ndistributor and must be accompanied by a properly executed assignment or power\nof attorney with respect to such bonds in such form as the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance may require. (ii)\n\nAny interest accruing on bonds offered\nas collateral under this subdivision shall belong to the distributor. (3)\n(i) Financial institution passbooks and\ncertificates of deposit offered as collateral under this subdivision must\nrepresent money on deposit with a financial institution approved by the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. Certificates of deposit must have maturity\ndates at least one year subsequent to the date of deposit with the Department\nof Taxation and Finance. Additionally, financial institution passbooks and\ncertificates of deposit offered under this subdivision must be: (a) prepared in the name of the\ndistributor; (b) accompanied by a\nsigned undated withdrawal slip; (c) accompanied by a properly completed letter of transmittal in such form as the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance may require, advising that the proceeds of\nsuch passbook accounts or certificates of deposit may be withdrawn by the\ndepartment and applied against any liability of such distributor pursuant to\narticle 18 of the Tax Law; provided, however, that any interest accruing on\nsuch accounts or certificates shall belong to the distributor; and\n(d) accompanied by a letter prepared on the\nletterhead of the financial institution and signed by an officer of such\nfinancial institution: (1)\nidentifying the\npassbooks or certificates of deposit by account number and confirming that\nwithdrawal of principal from the passbook or certificate of deposit offered as\ncollateral will not be permitted without written consent from the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance; and\n(2)\nstating that any right of setoff which the financial institution may possess\nagainst the distributor resulting from a defaulted obligation of such\ndistributor shall be subservient to the interest of the Department of Taxation\nand Finance in the passbook or certificate of deposit offered as\ncollateral. (ii)\n\nAny interest accruing on passbooks or\ncertificates offered as collateral under this subdivision shall belong to the\ndistributor. (4)\n\nStandby\nletters of credit offered as collateral under this subdivision must: (i) be irrevocable for such period of time as\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance shall determine; (ii)\nbe made payable to the New York State\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance; (iii)\nbe issued or confirmed by a bank\napproved by the Department of Taxation and Finance; and\n(iv)\ncontain such other payment terms as are\nacceptable to the Department of Taxation and Finance. (5)\n\nAny security deposited with the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance pursuant to this subdivision must have a\nfair market value at least equal to the amount of any bond required pursuant to\nsubdivision (b) of this section. Fair market value greater than the par value\nof the security on maturity will not be recognized. Accepted marketable\nsecurities deposited as security under this subdivision shall be kept in the\njoint custody of the Comptroller and the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance\nand may be sold by the Department of Taxation and Finance, should it become\nnecessary to do so in order to recover any sums due from the distributor\npursuant to article 18 of the Tax Law. No such sale shall be had until after\nthe distributor has had an opportunity to litigate the validity of any tax at\nissue, in the manner set forth in section\n430\nof the Tax Law, if such distributor\nelects to do so. Upon any such sale of securities, the surplus, if any, above\nthe sums due under article 18 of the Tax Law, shall be returned to such\ndistributor. (d) The\nregistration of a distributor of alcoholic beverages may be denied or cancelled\nupon a failure to file or increase the amount of a bond or a failure to deposit\nor increase the amount of acceptable security when required by the department, or for any failure to maintain in full force and effect such bond or security. A bond may be required to be filed with the department, acceptable security may\nbe required to be deposited with the department or the amount of such bond or\nsecurity may be required to be increased at any time it is deemed necessary to\nsecure the payment of any sums due pursuant to article 18 of the Tax Law.

In addition to\ndenying or cancelling the registration of a distributor of alcoholic beverages, in the case of the failure to file a bond or deposit acceptable security or\nincrease the amounts thereof, the Department of Taxation and Finance may\nforward a written statement of facts showing such failures to the New York\n\nState Liquor Authority and may request the revocation or suspension of any\nlicense or licenses of such applicant or distributor on account of such\nfailures. (e) Any determination\npursuant to this section with respect to the necessity for or the amount of a\nbond or acceptable security or any increase to the amounts of such bond or\nsecurity may be challenged through a hearing process, provided a petition for\nreview of such determination is timely filed.
