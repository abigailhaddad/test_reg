Providers shall establish written protocols to ensure reports\ninvolving multiple mandated reporters are properly made and\ndocumented. (f) The Office shall\ndevelop protocols in consultation with the Justice Center to assist providers\nin appropriately and therapeutically responding in circumstances where patients\nhave a demonstrated pattern of frequently reporting allegations of abuse or\nneglect that are not reasonably reliable (i.e., there is no possibility that an\nallegation is true).
