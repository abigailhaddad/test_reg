  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 590.7 - \"in lieu of\" moving expenses for business or farm occupants\n\nState Regulations\n\"In lieu of\" actual, reasonable and necessary moving\nexpenses, searching fees and actual direct losses of tangible personal\nproperty, a business or farm operation is eligible for a payment equal to the\naverage annual net earnings of the displaced business or farm, except such\npayment shall not be less than $2,500 nor more than $10,000 providing the\nfollowing requirements are met: (a) Business. The owner of the business eligible for relocation expenses must\nsubmit a written application as prescribed by the commissioner, with\neligibility for payment contingent upon the State's determination that the\nbusiness: (1)\ncannot be relocated without a\nsubstantial loss of patronage, herein defined as the average dollar volume of\nbusiness transacted during the two taxable years immediately preceding the year\nin which the business is relocated; and\n(2)\nis not part of a commercial enterprise\nhaving at least one other establishment which is not being acquired by the\n\nState or the United States and which is engaged in the same or similar\nbusiness; and\n(3)\nthe business\ncontributes materially to the income of the displaced owner. (b) Farm. The owner of a displaced\nfarm operation must submit a written application as prescribed by the\ncommissioner, with eligibility for payment contingent upon the State's\ndetermination that: (1)\nthe farm operator has\ndiscontinued or relocated his entire operation at the present location; and\n(2)\nin the case of a partial\ntaking, the property remaining after the acquisition is no longer an economic\nunit as determined by the State in its appraisal process. (c) The department will calculate a payment\n\"in lieu of\" moving expenses equivalent to the average annual net earnings. The\nterm \"average annual net earnings\" means one-half of any net earnings of the\nbusiness or farm before Federal, State and local income taxes during the two\ntaxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which the business or\nfarm is relocated. Such earnings shall include any compensation paid by the\nbusiness or farm to the owner and his or her immediate family during the base\nyear period. In the case of a corporation, earnings shall include any\ncompensation paid by the corporation to the owner of a majority interest in the\ncorporation. For purposes of determining majority ownership, stock held by a\nperson and his or her immediate family shall be treated as one unit. (d) If the business or farm affected can show\nthat it was in business 12 consecutive months during the two taxable years\nprior to the taxable year in which it is required to relocate; had income\nduring such period and is otherwise eligible, the owner of a business is\neligible to receive the \"in lieu of\" payment. Where the business was in\noperation for 12 consecutive months or more but was not in operation during the\nentire two preceding taxable years, the payment shall be computed by dividing\nthe net earnings by the number of months the business was operated and\nmultiplying by 12. A taxable year is defined as any 12-month period used by the\nbusiness in filing income tax returns. (e) For the owner of a business or farm to be\nentitled to this payment, the business or farm must provide information to\nsupport the net earnings. State or Federal income tax returns for the years in\nquestion are acceptable as evidence of earnings. Any commonly accepted method\nof verifying earnings may be offered provided it grants the State the right to\nreview the records and accounts of the business or farm. The eligible person\nwill be notified in writing by the department regarding his or her eligibility\nand the amount of the \"in lieu of\" payment, if any, will be set forth\ntherein. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n590.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
