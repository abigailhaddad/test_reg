  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-1.6 - Bank reconciliation\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe actual cash balance as set forth in the bank's\nstatement shall be reconciled monthly with the corresponding general ledger\naccounts. The difference between the bank balance and the ledger account is\ngenerally the result of outstanding checks and deposits in transit, but there\nmay be items such as bank charges to be considered and errors in the bank\nstatement such as improper charges and credits. The verification of the bank\nbalance shall include a careful examination of the cancelled checks, each check\nbeing scrutinized as to amounts, dates, and indorsements, and compared to the\nvoucher and other documents supporting the disbursements. Check books shall be\nexamined and all spoiled or voided checks accounted for. Outstanding checks\nwhich are not presented for payment within a reasonable time after issuance\nshall be investigated. Checks representing transfers between funds shall be\nnoted and compared with the deposits representing transfers. The bank\nreconciliation may be made in the cash disbursements ledger or may be filed\nwith the respective bank statement and should be in a form similar to the\nfollowing: Balance, per bank statement 3/31/56\n$10,000.00\n\nDeduct-outstanding checks: #21 2/6/56 $300.00\n#26 2/28/56 400.00\n#39 3/30/56 900.00\n1,600.00\n$ 8,400.00\n\nAdd: deposit in transit credited by bank\n4/3/56\n1,200.00\n\nGeneral ledger balance 3/31/56\n$9,600.00\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
