Tit. 9 § 426.1 - Authority and purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) These\nregulations implement article 14 of the Parks, Recreation and Historic\n\nPreservation Law, which was enacted by the New York State Historic Preservation\n\nAct of 1980 (chapter 354 of the Laws of 1980). The act became effective on\n\nAugust 22, 1980. (b) The purpose of\nthe State Historic Preservation Act is to continue and advance the State's\nhistoric preservation programs and activities, to continue the responsibility\nfor the coordination of such programs and activities with the Commissioner of\n\nParks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, to foster consistency of State\nactivities with historic preservation policy, to encourage and assist local\ngovernments in local preservation programs and activities, and to encourage and\nassist private agencies and individuals undertaking preservation by private\nmeans. (c) The act declares it to\nbe the public policy and in the public interest of this State to engage in a\ncomprehensive program of historic preservation. (d) The act authorizes the Commissioner of\n\nParks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, in consultation with the State\n\nBoard for Historic Preservation, to establish the New York State Register of\n\nHistoric Places, consisting of sites, districts, structures, buildings, areas\nor objects above or below the surface of the earth whether on land or in the\nwaters of the State, together with any designated improvements thereon, significant in the history, architecture, archeology or culture of the State, its communities or the nation. (e) The act requires State agencies to consult with the commissioner if it appears\nthat any project which is being planned may or will cause any change, beneficial or adverse, in the quality of any historic, architectural, archeological or cultural property that is listed on the National Register of\n\nHistoric Places or property listed on the State Register of Historic Places or\nthat is determined by the commissioner to be eligible for listing on the State\n\nRegister of Historic Places. It requires State agencies, to the fullest extent\npracticable, consistent with other provisions of the law, to avoid or mitigate\nadverse impacts to such properties, to fully explore all feasible and prudent\nalternatives and to give due consideration to feasible and prudent plans which\nwould avoid or mitigate adverse impacts to such property.
