  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 509.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Influenza\nis an unpredictable disease that can cause serious illnesses, death, and\nhealthcare disruption during any given year. Recent influenza seasons in New\n\nYork State have been worse than those experienced a decade ago. (b) In response to this increased public\nhealth threat, New York must take active steps to prevent and control\ntransmission of seasonal influenza. The seriousness of the continuing influenza\nthreat and the failure of the health care system to achieve acceptable\nvaccination rates through voluntary programs necessitate further\naction. (c) Although masks are not\nas effective as vaccination, evidence indicates that wearing a surgical or\nprocedure mask will lessen transmission of influenza from patients experiencing\nrespiratory symptoms. It is also known that persons incubating influenza may\nshed the influenza virus before they have noticeable symptoms of influenza. The\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that patients who\nmay have an infectious respiratory illness wear a mask when not in isolation\nand that healthcare personnel wear a mask when in close contact with\nsymptomatic patients. Further, the Infectious Disease Society of America\nrecommends that healthcare personnel who are not vaccinated for influenza wear\nmasks. (d) Recently, the New York\n\nState Department of Health (DOH) adopted regulations at 10 NYCRR section 2.59\nto require all unvaccinated personnel in certain health settings to wear\nsurgical or procedure masks during the time when the Commissioner of Health\ndetermines that influenza is prevalent. Specifically, the DOH regulations apply\nto general hospitals, nursing homes, diagnostic and treatment centers, certified home health agencies, long term home health care programs, acquired\nimmune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) home care programs, licensed home care\nservice agencies, limited licensed home care service agencies and hospices\n(licensed by DOH under Public Health Law, articles 28, 36 and 40). (e) It is critical for the Office of Mental\n\nHealth to join in a statewide effort to reduce the morbidity and mortality of\ninfluenza, by combining efforts and pursuing a common path of prevention and\nintervention. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 14\n§\n509.1\n\nAdopted, New\n\nYork State Register, Volume XXXVI, Issue 22, effective\n6/4/2014\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
