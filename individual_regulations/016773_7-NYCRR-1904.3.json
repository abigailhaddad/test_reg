Tit. 7 § 1904.3 - Relapse Program\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf an inmate who is participating in a continuous temporary\nrelease program receives a urinalysis or breathalyzer test that is positive for\ndrugs or alcohol in violation of his memorandum of agreement, he may, after\nbeing reviewed and approved by the Temporary Release Committee (TRC) and the\nsuperintendent, in accordance with section\n1904.2\n(i)-(k)\nof this Part, be given the opportunity to enter a relapse program for alcohol\nand substance abuse treatment. Participation in the Relapse Program will be\nbased upon the inmate's consent to the following agreement: RELAPSE PROGRAM AGREEMENT\nI want to participate in the Relapse Program which is part\nof the Continuous Temporary Release Program. I understand that the results of a\nurinalysis/breathalyzer test dated __ constitute a violation of Departmental, institutional and/or temporary release program rules and regulations. I also\nunderstand that, based upon the subject test results, I would ordinarily be\nserved with a misbehavior report alleging a violation of the Standards of\n\nInmate Behavior and be referred to the Temporary Release Committee for a\ntemporary release removal proceeding. I agree, however, to waive service of a\nmisbehavior report and any disciplinary proceeding on this issue. I further\nagree to participate in the Department's Relapse Program for alcohol and\nsubstance abuse treatment. I understand that I will have only one opportunity\nto participate in the Relapse Program. I understand that I will be transferred\nto a general confinement facility in order to participate in the Relapse\n\nProgram and that the Relapse Program will last approximately sixty days. I\nrealize that, in some instances, the Program will be shorter. Thereafter, if I\nhave successfully completed the Treatment Program, I will be returned to full\nparticipation in the continuous temporary release program. I also understand and agree that I can be removed from the\n\nRelapse Program at any time in accordance with the provisions of section\n1904.1. I further understand and agree that, if I am removed from the Relapse Program, I will not be reinstated to the continuous temporary release program. I also\nunderstand, however, that I may subsequently, reapply for participation in the\ncontinuous temporary release program pursuant to applicable Department\neligibility requirements. I have read and fully understand and agree to the above\nterms and conditions.
