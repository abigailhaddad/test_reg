  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1§ 1.7 - Samples of vitamin D milk to be procured for testing\n\nState Regulations\nA representative sample of vitamin D milk produced by each\nprocessor shall be obtained by the commissioner or by some person designated by\nhim for such purpose at intervals of approximately six months, and may be\nprocured more often if the commissioner deems necessary. The samples so\nobtained shall be delivered to the approved laboratory selected by the\nprocessor to be bio-assayed. The producer of the vitamin D milk shall in each\ninstance bear the cost of such tests. In his discretion, however, the\ncommissioner, if satisfied from accurate and continuous records showing the\namount and type of concentrate added to milk and the quantity of vitamin D milk\nproduced, may forego the procurement and the bio-assaying of one or more\nperiodical samples. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1§\n1.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
