  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-7.3 - Temporary use of permanent elevators\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Temporary use permitted. Passenger or\nfreight elevators being installed in buildings or other structures for\npermanent use may be used before completion of the building or other structure\nduring construction to carry persons or material, or both, provided such\nelevators conform to the following requirements: (b) Hoistway enclosures. The hoistway of any\nsuch elevator shall be enclosed with its permanent enclosure and permanent\ndoors or such hoistway shall be enclosed with either solid or openwork\nmaterial, except for access openings, as follows: (1)\n\nOpenwork enclosures shall be either wire\nmesh of at least No. 18 U.S. gage steel or expanded metal of at least No. 18\nU.S. gage. The openings of such openwork material shall reject a one-half inch\ndiameter ball. Such enclosures shall be provided with unperforated kick plates\ninstalled at every floor level above the lowest floor. Where a counterweight is\nprovided such openwork enclosure shall be covered on the counterweight side\nwith wire mesh of not less than No. 18 U.S. gage steel with openings that will\nreject a one-half inch diameter ball. Such mesh covering shall extend the full\nwidth of the counterweight plus one foot on each side. (2)\n\nSolid enclosures shall consist of\npartitions of exterior grade plywood at least three-eighths inch thick or of\nother material of equivalent strength. (3)\n\nEvery such enclosure shall be so\nsupported and braced that when subjected to a horizontal pressure of 100 pounds\napplied at any point the resulting deflection shall not exceed one inch and\nshall not reduce the running clearance to less than one inch. (c) Hoistway doors. Where\npermanent hoistway doors are not in place, temporary hoistway doors shall be\nprovided as follows: (1)\n\nEvery floor landing\nopening in a hoistway enclosure shall be provided with a solid door extending\nacross the full width of the opening and not less than 78 inches in height. The\nclearance between the bottom of any such door and the floor shall be not less\nthan one inch nor more than two inches. Each such door shall be provided with a\nvision panel of not more than 80 square inches in area. Every such vision panel\nshall be covered with wire mesh of No. 18 U.S. gage steel with openings which\nwill reject a one-half inch diameter ball. Each such hoistway door shall be\nprovided with a lock or latch which is openable from the hoistway side only and\ninaccessible from the landing side. (2)\n\nIf the hoistway door at the lowest\nterminal landing is locked automatically when closed with the car at the\nlanding, such door shall be provided with a means to unlock it from the landing\nside to permit access to the car. Such means shall be accessible only to\ndesignated persons. (3)\n\nWhere such\nhoistway doors are of the vertical sliding type, they shall be of a type that\nrequires counterweights. Provisions shall be made for the containment of the\ncounterweights if their means of suspension should fail. (d) Elevator car. Except where permanent\nelevator cars are used, temporary elevator cars used in permanent hoistways\nshall be constructed to conform to the following requirements: (1)\n\nFrame. The frame of every such car shall\nconsist of a safety plank and vertical stiles gusseted to a crosshead\nconstructed of steel channels. Such frame shall be designed and constructed to\ncarry safely all the loads intended to be imposed thereon. Steel diagonal\nbracing shall be provided to support the four corners of the car\nplatform. (2)\n\nPlatform. The\nplatform of every such car shall consist of a channel steel or aluminum frame\nand steel or aluminum stringers assembled as a unit and secured to the safety\nplank. Platform flooring shall be constructed of steel or aluminum plate or of\nwood. If wood is used, it shall be of structural grade lumber not less than two\ninches thick and shall be protected on the underside by steel sheeting of at\nleast No. 26 U.S. steel. Such flooring shall be securely fastened to the car\nplatform. (3)\n\nCar enclosures. Such\ntemporary elevator cars shall be enclosed on the top and on all sides except\nthose sides used as entrance and exit openings. Such enclosures shall consist\nof planking at least two inches thick, laid tight, or of other material of\nequivalent strength. The top of every such elevator car shall have an emergency\nexit opening in the enclosure of not less than 400 square inches in area with\nthe least dimension at least 16 inches. Such emergency exit openings shall be\nprovided with hinged hatch covers. (4)\n\nCar doors or gates. (i) Each such car shall be provided with a\ncar door or gate on the landing side. Such door or gate shall be at least six\nfeet in height and shall be of construction equivalent in strength to that of\nthe car enclosure. (ii)\n\nEvery\nopening in such car door or gate shall be of such size and shape as to reject a\nthree-inch diameter ball. (iii)\n\nEvery such car door or gate shall be equipped with an approved electric contact\nso arranged that the car cannot be operated unless the door or gate is within\ntwo inches of full closure. Such electric contact shall not be readily\naccessible from within the car. (iv)\n\nSuch car doors or gates shall be of the\nhorizontally or counterweighted vertically sliding type. Where a horizontal\ngate is used, such gate may be arranged to swing inward when fully\ncollapsed. (5)\n\nCar\ncontrols. The car controls of such elevators shall be so arranged that such\ncars can be operated or controlled only from within the cars. (e) Elevator operators. Such\nelevator cars shall be operated only by competent, trained, designated\npersons. (f) Testing. Prior to the\ninitial use of any temporary elevator installed in a permanent hoistway, such\nelevator shall be tested by a designated person. Such testing shall be in\naccordance with the following requirements: (1)\n\nThe car of such elevator shall be loaded\nto its rated capacity and operated at its rated speed to the upper and lower\nlimits of its travel at least twice in order to test the operation of the upper\nand lower auomatic limit devices as well as the operation of the hoisting\nmachine brake at various levels of the hoistway. (2)\n\nWith the rated load in place, the car\nsafeties shall be actuated by tripping the governor by hand while the car is\ntraveling downward at rated speed. (3)\n\nSuch test shall be repeated with no load\nat least once every month while the elevator is in use by operating at a slow\nspeed and tripping the governor by hand. (4)\nA written report of each test shall be\nmade and signed by the designated person making such tests. Such reports shall\ninclude the dates, test loads and speeds involved as well as the test results. Such written reports shall be kept in a log book on the job site available for\nexamination by the commissioner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
