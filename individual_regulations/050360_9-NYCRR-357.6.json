Tit. 9 § 357.6 - Probation intake\n\nState Regulations\n\nPrior to commencing diversion services, probation shall\nreview the complaint to determine whether it is within the scope of FCA article\n7. (a) Where the behavior meets the\ncriteria set forth in FCA article 7, pre-diversion services may be provided as\nan alternative to probation intake. (b) Where it is determined that the complaint\nis within the scope of FCA article 7 and the complainant seeks preliminary\nprocedure services, probation shall confer with any person seeking to file a\npetition, the potential respondent, family, and other interested persons\nconcerning the provision of diversion services before any petition may be\nfiled. This shall include: (1)\noffering\ncommunity-based alternatives to pre-dispositional placement where appropriate\nand available; (2)\nscheduling and\nholding at least one conference with the youth and his or her family and the\nperson or representatives of the entity seeking to file a petition under this\narticle concerning alternatives to filing a petition and services that are\navailable. Where feasible, such conference shall be held jointly with all\nparties present; (3)\nthe use of\neffective client engagement skills such as motivational interviewing with the\nyouth, and where practicable, his/her family; (4)\nidentifying the level of youth risk for\ncontinuing in the behaviors underlying the presenting problem using a\n\nState-approved risk and needs assessment. A youth presenting as low risk shall\nbe considered for prompt termination of diversion efforts with minimal\nprobation intervention services; (5)\nproviding, at the first contact, information on the availability of or referral to services in the geographic\narea where the youth and family are located to reduce the risk of continuing in\nthe presenting behaviors and prevent the filing of a petition under this\narticle; including: (i) residential respite: availability of a residential respite program, for up to 21 calendar days, if\nthe youth and parent(s) or other persons legally responsible for his/her care\nagree; (ii)\ncrisis intervention: availability of other non-residential crisis intervention programs such as\nfamily crisis counseling or alternative dispute resolution programs; (iii)\nshort-term safe house services: availability of safe house services when the youth has been identified as\nsexually exploited; and\n(iv)\ninformal respite: availability of a temporary location (usually the home of a\nfamily member or close friend) where the youth may stay during times of\nescalating/increased stress or conflict in the youth's primary\nresidence. (6)\nadvising\nthe youth and parent(s) or other person(s) legally responsible for his/her care\nof their rights and responsibilities, including the fact that they may be\nbarred from filing a petition where diversion services have been terminated\nbecause of their failure to consent to or participate in diversion\nservices. (c) Where the\ncomplainant is a school district or local educational agency, probation shall\nreview the steps taken by the school district or local educational agency to\nimprove the youth's attendance and/or conduct in school and attempt to engage\nthe school district or local educational agency in further diversion attempts, if it appears that such attempts will be beneficial to the youth. (d) Where the complainant states that the\nyouth has run away or is staying away from home, the probation department: (1)\nshall gather information from the\nparent(s) or other person(s) legally responsible for his/her care regarding\npossible contact information, and what efforts have been made to locate the\nyouth; and\n(2)\nmay attempt to\ncontact a runaway or stayaway youth for the purpose of engaging the youth and\nfamily in diversion services; and\n(3)\nshall inform the parent(s) or other\nperson(s) legally responsible for his/her care that they must file a report\nwith police where it is determined that the youth's whereabouts are unknown; and\n(4)\nmay refer the matter for\npetition for the purpose of seeking a warrant where efforts to locate and\nengage the youth are unsuccessful. (e) Probation shall attempt to secure from\nthe parent(s) or other person(s) legally responsible for his/her care all\nnecessary consents for release of information regarding the youth, and shall\nfurther request from the school certain information deemed pertinent to the\npresenting behaviors. For school-based complaints, where parents refuse such\nconsent, probation may refer the matter for petition for the purpose of\nrequesting a court order to direct either the parent or other person(s) legally\nresponsible for his/her care to sign a release of information for school\nrecords or for the court on its own volition, to direct the release of\ninformation from school authorities. Where appropriate, probation may recommend\nthat the school pursue an educational neglect report. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
