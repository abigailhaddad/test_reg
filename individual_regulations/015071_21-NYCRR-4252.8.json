  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 4252.8 - Matching investment funds requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nAt such time as an investment entity has invested 50 percent\nof the program funds committed to such investment entity and annually\nthereafter, the aggregate investments of program funds by the investment entity\nin beneficiary companies shall be leveraged with matching investment funds from\nprivate sources of capital, excluding investments after the initial funding\nround, at a ratio equal to or greater than two to one. Investments made in\nfunding rounds prior to the date of the initial investment of program funds\nshall not be counted toward satisfying this matching investment funds\nrequirement. Funding provided by the State of New York, including, but not\nlimited to, small business technology investment fund proceeds, does not\nsatisfy this matching investment funds requirement. In the case of two or more\ninnovate NY investment entities investing in the same beneficiary company in\nthe same investment round, matching funds from all private sources shall be\napplied as determined by the investment entities but no amount shall be applied\nas matching funds more than once. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n4252.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
