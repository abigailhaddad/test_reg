  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 375-1.8 - Remedial program\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The goals\nof each remedial program are set forth respectively in sections\n375-2.8, 375-3.8\nand\n375-4.8\nof this Part. To achieve\nthe applicable goals the remedial program may include, but not be limited to, the actions set forth in this section. (1)\nA\nsite may be divided into operable units, as defined in section 375- 1.2(af) of\nthis Subpart. (2)\n\nMultiple work\nplans and reports may be approved for a site, as set forth in section\n375-1.6\nof this Subpart. (3)\n\nAll remedial programs shall address bulk\nstorage tanks or containment vessels, source removal and control and\ngroundwater protection and control measures, as set forth in subdivisions (b)\nthrough (d) of this section. (4)\n\nRemedy selection at a site may consider the use of innovative technologies\nwhich are demonstrated to be feasible to meet the remediation\nrequirements. (5)\n\nWhere the\nremedial program for a site requires ongoing site management, a site management\nplan will be developed for the site which will include, as applicable for the\nremedial program, the following plans: (i) institutional and engineering control plan; (ii)\nmonitoring plan; and/or\n(iii)\noperation and maintenance\nplan. (6)\n\nThe remedial\nprogram at a site shall analyze the impact of contamination at a site on the\nfollowing environmental media: (i) soil; (ii)\ngroundwater; (iii)\nsurface water and sediments; (iv)\nsoil vapor; (v) ambient air; and\n(vi)\nbiota. (7)\n\nWhere an interim remedial measure is\nproposed at a site, such measure will be conducted pursuant to a\ndepartment-approved work plan. Such work plan shall require the submission of a\nfinal report upon conclusion of the measure. (b) Bulk storage tanks and containment\nvessels. (1)\n\nAll known petroleum storage\ntanks on the site, which are under the ownership or control of the remedial\nparty, shall be registered as set forth in section 612.2 of this\n\nTitle; (2)\n\nAll known chemical\nstorage tanks on the site, which are under the ownership or control of the\nremedial party, shall be registered as set forth in section\n596.2\nof this Title; (3)\n\nAll such known tanks that are\nout-of-service, which are under the ownership or control of the remedial party, shall be closed as set forth in section 613.9 of this Title (in the case of\npetroleum storage tanks) or section 598.10 of this Title (in the case of\nchemical storage tanks); and\n(4)\n\nWhere any contaminant is found to be stored on the site in containment vessels\nother than storage tanks (such as drums, transformers, sumps, and pits), or\nwhere petroleum storage tanks or chemical storage tanks are discovered on site\nduring the course of the remedial program and such tanks contain any\ncontaminant, such contaminants shall be removed and disposed of in accordance\nwith all applicable State and Federal requirements within a schedule approved\nby the department. (c) Source removal and control measures. The following is the hierarchy of source\nremoval and control measures which are to be used, ranked from most preferable\nto least preferable: (1)\n\nRemoval and/or\ntreatment. All sources, concentrated solid or semi-solid hazardous substances, dense non-aqueous phase liquid, light non-aqueous phase liquid and/or grossly\ncontaminated media shall be removed and/or treated; provided however, if the\nremoval and/or treatment of all such contamination is not feasible, such\ncontamination shall be removed or treated to the greatest extent\nfeasible. (2)\n\nContainment. Any\nsource remaining following removal and/or treatment set forth in this\nsubdivision shall be contained; provided however, if full containment is not\nfeasible, such source shall be contained to the greatest extent\nfeasible. (3)\n\nElimination of\nexposure. Exposure to any source remaining following removal, treatment and/or\ncontainment set forth in this subdivision shall be eliminated through\nadditional measures, including but not limited to, as applicable, the timely\nand sustained provision of alternative water supplies and the elimination of\nvolatilization into buildings; provided however, if such elimination is not\nfeasible such exposure shall be eliminated to the greatest extent\nfeasible. (4)\n\nTreatment of source\nat the point of exposure. Treatment of the exposure resulting from a source of\nenvironmental contamination at the point of exposure, as applicable, including\nbut not limited to, wellhead treatment or the management of volatile\ncontamination within buildings, shall be considered as a measure of last\nresort. (d) Groundwater\nprotection and control measures. (1)\n\nOn-site\ngroundwater contamination. All remedial programs shall consider the protection\nof groundwater and will consider department guidance including, but not limited\nto, any groundwater remediation strategy issued as set forth in ECL 15-3109. The following are the measures to be considered: (i) source removal or control as set forth in\nsubdivision (c) of this section; (ii)\ngroundwater quality restoration. Restoration of groundwater shall be evaluated to determine the feasibility of\nmeasures to restore groundwater quality to meet applicable standards and\nguidance of this section; (iii)\nplume containment/stabilization. All remedies shall, to the extent feasible, prevent the further migration of groundwater plumes, whether on-site or\noff-site; provided, however that a volunteer in the Brownfield Cleanup Program\nshall only be obligated to evaluate the feasibility of containing the plume\non-site. The development of alternatives will include an evaluation of feasible\nremedial alternatives that can achieve groundwater plume\ncontainment/stabilization. (2)\n\nOff-site source of groundwater\ncontamination with no on-site source (or contribution). (i) On-site groundwater contamination may be\nattributed to an off-site source if the department determines that: (a) no act of the remedial party has\ncontributed to the upgradient contamination, or caused such contamination to\nbecome worse; (b) there is an\noff-site source of contamination, located on one or more upgradient locations, that has impacted on-site groundwater as a result of the migration of the\ncontaminant in, or on, the groundwater; and\n(c) there is not an on-site source(s) that\nmay be causing or contributing more than inconsequential amounts to the\ngroundwater contamination. (ii)\n\nWhere the department has determined that\nthe criteria in this paragraph have been satisfied, the remedial party shall: (a) have no remedial responsibilities with\nrespect to such groundwater contamination migrating under the site; (b) continue to satisfy the conditions in\nsubparagraph (2)(i) of this subdivision; (c) identify a remedy for the site which\neliminates or mitigates, to the extent feasible, the impact of any off-site\ncontamination entering the site. (3)\n\nOff-site source of groundwater\ncontamination with an on-site source (or contribution): (i) on-site groundwater contamination may be\nattributed to both an on-site and an off-site source, if the department\ndetermines that: (a) there is an off-site\nsource of contamination, located at one or more upgradient locations, that has\nimpacted on-site groundwater as a result of the migration of the contaminant\nin, or on, the groundwater; and\n(b) there is an on-site source(s) that may be contributing to the groundwater\ncontamination; and\n(ii)\nwhere the department has determined that the criteria in subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph exist, the remedial party shall: (a) identify a remedy for the site which\nincludes removal, containment or treatment of the on-site sources contributing\nto the groundwater contamination; and\n(b) include in the remedy actions which\neliminate or mitigate on-site environmental or public health exposures, to the\nextent feasible, resulting from any off-site contamination entering the\nsite. (4)\n\nGroundwater protection decisionmaking shall consider the following factors set\nforth at ECL 15-3109 and any groundwater strategy issued pursuant thereto: (i) recognition that both short- and\nlong-term remediation strategies may be necessary to address groundwater\ncontamination; (ii)\nidentification\nof the long-term groundwater remedial activities that are required to be taken\nby the State pursuant to this Part for sites which the department has\ndetermined pose a significant threat as set forth in section\n375-2.7; and\n(iii)\nestablishment of criteria for the\nprioritization of long-term groundwater remediation activities to be performed\nby the department. Such criteria shall include, but not be limited to: (a) the current or reasonably anticipated\nfuture use of contaminated groundwater as drinking water; (b) the current or reasonably anticipated\nfuture use of a groundwater aquifer into which contaminated groundwater is\nflowing as drinking water; (c) the\ncurrent or reasonably anticipated future use of contaminated groundwater for\nnon-potable purposes including, but not limited to, recreational uses, institutional uses and agricultural or non-agricultural irrigation; (d) community needs; (e) feasibility of remediation; and\n(f) protection of natural resources and\nminimizing the impairment of the resource; and\n(iv)\nnotwithstanding clauses (iii)(a) through\n(f) of this paragraph, while the current use of groundwater as drinking water\nmay be considered, the absence of such use shall not exclude the need for\nremediation. (e) Scope of the investigation. (1)\n\nThe goals of a remedial investigation\ninclude, but are not limited, to the: (i) delineation of the aerial and vertical extent of the contamination at, and\nemanating from all media at the site and the nature of that\ncontamination; (ii)\ncharacterization of the surface and subsurface characteristics of the site, including topography, surface drainage, stratigraphy, depth to groundwater, and\nany aquifers that have been impacted or have the potential to be\nimpacted; (iii)\nidentification of\nthe sources of contamination, the migration pathways and actual or potential\nreceptors of contaminants; (iv)\nevaluation of actual and potential threats to public health and the\nenvironment; (v) production of data\nof sufficient quantity and quality to support the necessity for, and the\nproposed extent of, remediation and to support the evaluation of proposed\nalternatives. (2)\n\nSuch\ninvestigation shall emphasize data collection, sampling and monitoring, as\nnecessary, and includes but is not limited to: (i) characterization of site geologic and\nhydrogeologic conditions, including groundwater flow, contaminant movement, and\nthe response of the groundwater system to extraction; (ii)\nassessment of the existing and potential\nimpact of groundwater contamination on private or community water supply wells, surface water quality, air quality, and indoor air quality; (iii)\nsampling and analysis necessary to\ngather sufficient information to evaluate human and environmental exposure\npathways, as well as, any actual or potential adverse effects due to site\ncontamination; and\n(iv)\ndelineation\nof the nature and extent of contamination sufficient to determine the necessity\nfor, and the proposed extent of remediation, in order to support the\ndevelopment and evaluation of proposed alternatives in the remedy selection\nprocess. (3)\n\nHistorical\ndata may be submitted in lieu of collecting new data or to supplement new data\nprovided the appropriate quality assurance requirements are met and the data\nwas collected in a manner consistent with appropriate sampling protocols. All\ninformation relevant to the ongoing work must be referenced in the reports\nincluding sampling protocols. (f) Remedy selection. A remedy shall be\nselected upon consideration of these nine factors: (1)\n\nOverall protectiveness of the public\nhealth and the environment. (2)\n\nStandards, criteria and guidance. The remedy will: (i) conform to standards and criteria that\nare generally applicable, consistently applied, and officially promulgated, that are either directly applicable, or that are not directly applicable but\nare relevant and appropriate, unless good cause exists why conformity should be\ndispensed with. Good cause exists if any of the following is present: (a) the proposed action is only part of a\ncomplete program or project that will conform to such standard or criterion\nupon completion; (b) conformity to\nsuch standard or criterion will result in greater risk to the public health or\nto the environment than alternatives; (c) conformity to such standard or criterion\nis technically impracticable from an engineering perspective; (d) the program or project will attain a\nlevel of performance that is equivalent to that required by the standard or\ncriterion through the use of another method or approach; and\n(ii)\nconsider applicable\ndepartment guidance. (3)\n\nLong-term effectiveness and permanence: A program or project that achieves a\ncomplete and permanent cleanup of the site is preferred over a program or\nproject that does not do so. (4)\n\nReduction in toxicity, mobility or volume of contamination through treatment. A\nprogram or project that permanently and significantly reduces the toxicity, mobility or volume of contamination is to be preferred over a program or\nproject that does not do so. The following is the hierarchy of technologies\nranked from the most preferable to the least preferable: (i) destruction, on-site or\noff-site; (ii)\nseparation or\ntreatment, on-site or off-site; (iii)\nsolidification or chemical fixation, on-site or off-site; and\n(iv)\ncontrol and isolation, on-site or off-site. (5)\n\nShort-term impacts and\neffectiveness. (6)\n\nImplementability. (7)\n\nCost-effectiveness, including capital costs and annual site maintenance plan\ncosts. (8)\n\nCommunity\nacceptance. (9)\n\nLand use, provided\nthe department determines that there is reasonable certainty associated with\nsuch use. In assessing reasonable certainty, the department shall consider: (i) the current, intended, and reasonably\nanticipated future land uses of the site and its surroundings in the selection\nof the remedy for soil remediation under the brownfield cleanup and\nenvironmental restoration programs, and may consider land use in the State\n\nSuperfund Program, where cleanup to pre-disposal conditions is determined not\nfeasible; (ii)\nthe department's\ndetermination on the use of the site will be in accordance with subdivision (g)\nof this section; (iii)\nthe\nreasonably anticipated future use of the site and its surroundings, which shall\nbe documented in the analysis of alternatives, taking into consideration\nfactors including, but not limited to, the following: (a) current use and historical and/or recent\ndevelopment patterns; (b) applicable zoning laws and maps; (c) brownfield opportunity areas as\ndesignated set forth in GML 970-r; (d) applicable comprehensive community master\nplans, local waterfront revitalization plans as provided for in EL article 42, or any other applicable land use plan formally adopted by a\nmunicipality; (e) proximity to real\nproperty currently used for residential use, and to urban, commercial, industrial, agricultural, and recreational areas; (f) any written and oral comments submitted\nby members of the public on the proposed use as part of the activities\nperformed pursuant to the citizen participation plan; (g) environmental justice concerns, which for\npurposes of this Subpart, include the extent to which the proposed use may\nreasonably be expected to cause or increase a disproportionate burden on the\ncommunity in which the site is located, including low-income minority\ncommunities, or to result in a disproportionate concentration of commercial or\nindustrial uses in what has historically been a mixed use or residential\ncommunity; (h) Federal or State\nland use designations; (i) population growth patterns and projections; (j) accessibility to existing\ninfrastructure; (k) proximity of\nthe site to important cultural resources, including Federal or State historic\nor heritage sites or native American religious sites; (l) natural resources, including proximity of\nthe site to important Federal, State or local natural resources, including\nwaterways, wildlife refuges, wetlands, or critical habitats of endangered or\nthreatened species; (m) potential\nvulnerability of groundwater to contamination that might emanate from the site, including proximity to wellhead protection and groundwater recharge areas and\nother areas identified by the department and the State's comprehensive\ngroundwater remediation and protection program established in ECL article 15, title 31; (n) proximity to flood\nplains; (o) geography and geology; and\n(p) current institutional\ncontrols applicable to the site. (g) Use of a site. The use of a site, or\nportion of a site, shall be for either unrestricted or restricted use. (1)\n\nSuch uses fall into one of the following\ncategories: (i) Unrestricted use which is a\nuse without imposed restrictions, such as environmental easements or other land\nuse controls; or\n(ii)\n\nRestricted\nuse which is a use with imposed restrictions, such as environmental easements, which as part of the remedy selected for the site require a site management\nplan which relies on institutional controls or engineering controls to manage\nexposure to contamination remaining at a site. (2)\n\nRestricted uses include: (i) Residential use which is the land use\ncategory which allows a site to be used for any use other than raising live\nstock or producing animal products for human consumption. Restrictions on the\nuse of groundwater are allowed, but no other institutional or engineering\ncontrols are allowed relative to the residential use soil cleanup objectives. This is the land use category which will be considered for single-family\nhousing; (ii)\n\nRestricted-residential use which is the land use category which shall only be\nconsidered when there is common ownership or a single owner/managing entity of\nthe site. Restricted-residential use: (a) shall, at a minimum, include restrictions which prohibit: (1)\nany vegetable gardens on a site, although\ncommunity vegetable gardens may be considered with department approval; and\n(2)\nsingle-family housing; and\n(b) includes active\nrecreational uses, which are public uses with a reasonable potential for soil\ncontact; (iii)\n\nCommercial use which is the land use category which shall only be considered\nfor the primary purpose of buying, selling or trading of merchandise or\nservices. Commercial use includes passive recreational uses, which are public\nuses with limited potential for soil contact; and\n(iv)\n\nIndustrial use which is the land use\ncategory which shall only be considered for the primary purpose of\nmanufacturing, production, fabrication or assembly processes and ancillary\nservices. Industrial use does not include any recreational component. (3)\n\nThe department may approve a\nremedial program which relies upon no restrictions on use (unrestricted use) or\non a range of restrictions on use (restricted uses). The following hierarchy\nrepresents the range from a less restrictive to a more restrictive land use: (i) residential; (ii)\nrestricted-residential; (iii)\ncommercial; and\n(iv)\nindustrial. (4)\n\nThe department's determination of the\nallowable use of a site as part of a remedial program: (i) is not a determination by the department\nrelative to a specific future use; (ii)\nis the least restrictive use of the\nsite, as set forth in paragraph three of this subdivision, allowed by such\nremedial program and would allow all more restrictive uses to occur on the site\n(e.g., a site cleanup to a commercial use would also be protective of\nindustrial use); and\n(iii)\nmay\ndisregard the remedial party's proposed use and approve a remedy upon a use\nwhich is consistent with existing zoning laws or maps. (5)\n\nWhere the use of the site proposed for a\nremedial program does not conform with applicable zoning laws or maps or the\nreasonably anticipated future use of the site as determined by the department, the department shall not approve a remedy based on such non-conforming use\n(e.g., the department cannot approve a cleanup to commercial uses for a\nproperty with residential zoning), unless it: (i) is based on a cleanup level that would\nrequire a less restrictive use of the site than would be allowed based upon\ncurrent zoning laws or maps (e.g., the department may approve a cleanup to\nresidential levels for a property which is zoned for commercial use); or\n(ii)\ncan be shown to the\ndepartment's satisfaction that zoning changes are or will be sought, in which\nevent the department will conditionally approve the remedy but will not issue a\ncertificate of completion until such use is consistent with existing zoning\nlaws or maps. (6)\n\nFor\npurposes of determining the appropriate land use category, the remedial party\nwill consider the nature of the uses and the activities which are occurring, or\nmay occur, at the site: (i) on the ground\nlevel of any structure; (ii)\non the\nsurrounding land; or\n(iii)\nin the\nsubsurface to a depth of 15 feet below the surface of the site. (h) Institutional\ncontrols, engineering controls and environmental easements. (1)\n\nInstitutional and engineering controls. A\nremedy that includes institutional controls and/or engineering controls must\ninclude the following: (i) a complete\ndescription of any use restrictions and/or institutional controls, their role\nin achieving the remedial objectives of the remedy and the mechanisms that will\nbe used to implement, maintain, monitor, and enforce such restrictions and\ncontrols; (ii)\na complete\ndescription of any engineering controls and any site management plan\nrequirements, including the mechanisms that will be used to continually\nimplement, maintain, monitor, and enforce such controls and\nrequirements; (iii)\nan evaluation\nof the reliability and viability of the long-term implementation, maintenance, monitoring, and enforcement of any proposed institutional or engineering\ncontrols and analysis of the costs of implementing, maintaining, monitoring and\nenforcing such controls, including costs that may be borne by state or local\ngovernments. To accomplish this: (a) the\nremedial party must submit to the department a detailed written estimate of the\nlong-term cost, in current dollars, for implementing the institutional or\nengineering controls. The cost estimate must be based on the cost of\nimplementing the institutional or engineering controls as set forth in the\nremedial work plan; and\n(b) the\ncost estimate for implementing the institutional/engineering controls must\nreflect consideration of the size, type, and location of the area subject to\nthe institutional or engineering controls; the remedy and the nature and extent\nof contamination subject to the institutional/engineering controls; (iv)\nan analysis sufficient to\nsupport a conclusion that effective implementation, maintenance, monitoring and\nenforcement of institutional and/or engineering controls can be reasonably\nexpected; (v) where required by the\ndepartment, financial assurance, in accordance with section\n375-1.11\n(c) of\nthis Subpart, to ensure the long term implementation, maintenance, monitoring, and enforcement of any such controls; and\n(vi)\nany engineering control must be used in\nconjunction with institutional controls to ensure the continued integrity of\nsuch engineering control. (2)\n\nEnvironmental easements. (i) Any institutional controls, engineering\ncontrols, use restrictions and/or any site management requirements applicable\nto the remedial site will be contained in an environmental easement, which\nshall be: (a) created and recorded pursuant\nto ECL article 71, title 36; (b) in\na form and manner as prescribed by the commissioner; (c) in compliance with GOL 5-703(1) and ECL\n71-3605(2); and\n(d) recordable\npursuant to R PL 291. (ii)\n\nAgents, employees or other\nrepresentatives of the State may enter and inspect the property burdened by an\nenvironmental easement with reasonable prior notice to the property owner, to\nassure compliance with the restrictions identified by the environmental\neasement. (3)\n\nInstitutional control/engineering control certification. (i) The owner or the remedial party at a site\nat which institutional or engineering controls are employed as part of a\nremedy, must annually submit, unless an alternate certification period is\nprovided in writing by the department, a written certification: (a) by a professional engineer, or by such\nother qualified environmental professional as the department may find\nacceptable as set forth in ECL 27- 1415(b); or\n(b) where the only control is an\ninstitutional control on the use of the property, the certification may be made\nby the property owner. (ii)\n\nThe certification shall be included in a\nreport summarizing the site management effort for the certification period, in\nsuch form and manner as the department may require, and shall certify that: (a) the inspection of the site to confirm the\neffectiveness of the institutional and engineering controls required by the\nremedial program was performed under the direction of the individual identified\nin subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (b) the institutional controls and/or\nengineering controls employed at such site: (1)\nare in-place; (2)\nare in the department-approved format; and\n(3)\nthat nothing has occurred\nthat would impair the ability of such control to protect the public health and\nenvironment; (c) the\nowner will continue to allow access to such real property to evaluate the\ncontinued maintenance of such controls; (d) nothing has occurred that would\nconstitute a violation or failure to comply with any site management plan for\nsuch controls; (e) the report and\nall attachments were prepared under the direction of, and reviewed by, the\nparty making the certification; (f) to the best of his/her knowledge and belief, the work and conclusions described\nin this certification are in accordance with the requirements of the site\nremedial program, and generally accepted engineering practices; and\n(g) the information presented is accurate and\ncomplete. (iii)\n\nOnly one\nsuch certification shall be filed per site. If a site is comprised of multiple\nproperties or parcels, the remedial party shall arrange to file one\nconsolidated certification. (iv)\n\nIn\nthe event that the certification cannot be provided due to a failure of one or\nmore of the institutional or engineering controls, the department will be\nprovided: (a) timely notification explaining\nthe cause for such failure; (b) a\nwork plan to implement the corrective measures necessary in order to be able to\nprovide the certification; and\n(c) a schedule for those corrective measures. (v) In addition to the periodic reporting\nrequirement, the remedial party shall timely notify the department of failures\nof one or more of the institutional or engineering controls and shall provide a\nwork plan to remedy the failure of the institutional or engineering\ncontrol. (vi)\n\nThe work plan\nreferenced in subparagraphs (iv) and (v) of this paragraph will be reviewed by\nthe department as set forth in section\n375-1.6\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart and the corrective measures shall be implemented in accordance with the\napproved work plan. A certification, meeting the requirements of subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph, shall be submitted upon completion of the corrective\nmeasures. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
