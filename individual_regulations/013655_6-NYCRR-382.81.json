  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 382.81 - Waste characteristics\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nfollowing requirements are minimum requirements for all classes of waste and\nare intended to facilitate handling at the disposal site and provide protection\nof health and safety of personnel at the disposal site. (1)\n\nWaste must not be packaged for disposal\nin cardboard or fiberboard boxes. (2)\n\nLiquid waste must be solidified or\nstabilized by other methods. Only those methods approved by the department in\nthe permit may be used. Liquid waste packaged in absorbent materials is not\nacceptable for disposal. (3)\n\nFree-standing and noncorrosive liquids in solid waste and solidified or\nstabilized liquid waste must be minimized to the extent reasonably achievable, but in no case must the amount of liquid exceed one-half percent (0.5 percent)\nof the waste volume. (4)\n\nWaste must\nnot be readily capable of detonation or of explosive decomposition or reaction\nat normal pressures and temperatures, or of explosive reaction with\nwater. (5)\n\nWaste must not contain, or be capable of generating, quantities of toxic gases, vapors or fumes harmful\nto persons transporting, handling or disposing of the waste. This does not\napply to low-level radioactive gaseous waste packaged in accordance with\nparagraph (7) of this subdivision. (6)\n\nWaste must not be pyrophoric. Pyrophoric\nmaterials contained in waste must be treated, prepared and packaged to be\nnonflammable. (7)\n\nWaste in a\ngaseous form must be packaged at a pressure that does not exceed 1.5\natmospheres at 68° F (20° C). Total activity must not exceed 100 curies\nper container. (8)\n\nWaste containing\nhazardous, biological, pathogenic or infectious material must be treated to\nminimize the potential hazard from the nonradiological materials. (b) The requirements in this\nsection are intended to provide stability of the waste. Stability is intended\nto ensure that the waste does not structurally degrade and affect overall\nstability of the site through slumping, collapse, or other failure of the\ndisposal unit and thereby lead to water infiltration. Stability is also a\nfactor in limiting exposure to an inadvertent intruder, since it provides a\nrecognizable and nondispersible waste. (1)\n\nWaste must have structural stability. A structurally stable waste form will\ngenerally maintain its physical dimensions and its form, under the expected\ndisposal conditions, such as weight of overburden and compaction equipment, the\npresence of moisture, and microbial activity, and internal factors such as\nradiation effects and chemical changes. Structural stability can be provided by\nthe waste form itself, processing the waste to a stable form, or placing the\nwaste in a disposal container or structure that provides stability after\ndisposal. (2)\n\nVoid spaces within\nthe waste and between the waste and its container must be minimized. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n382.81\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
