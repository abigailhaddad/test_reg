Tit. 18 § 519.11 - Scheduling and adjourning the hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The hearing will be held at a time and in\nan office of the department which are convenient to the appellant, as far as\npracticable. (b) Requests for\nadjournments of any scheduled hearing must be in writing and made as far in\nadvance of the scheduled hearing date as practicable, upon notice to the\nopposing party. Adjournments will not be routinely given as hearing dates are\nconsidered dates certain. However, upon written request, an appellant or the\ndepartment may have the hearing rescheduled to another date upon a showing of\ngood cause. Claims of court engagement will require submission of a detailed\naffidavit of actual engagement and claims of illness will require medical\ndocumentation. Adjournments in contemplation of settlement will require the\nconsent of both parties. (c) During\nthe course of a hearing, the hearing officer may adjourn the hearing when\nfundamental fairness would best be served by adjourning the hearing. (d) Written requests to adjourn a hearing\nmade prior to the date of the hearing must be made to the Bureau of Special\n\nHearings in accordance with the instructions in the notice of hearing. Requests\nfor adjournments made on the day of the hearing must be in writing to the\nhearing officer. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
