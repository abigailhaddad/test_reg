Tit. 9 § 2506.8 - Determination of legal regulated rents; penalties; fines; assessment of costs; attorney's fees; rent credits; where the proceeding is commenced on or after June 14, 2019\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. (1)\n\nBase Date: For the purposes of this\nsection, the Base Date shall be the date of the most recent reliable annual\nrent registration statement, filed and served upon a tenant six or more years\nprior to the filing of a complaint of overcharge or the initiation of a\nproceeding to determine the legal regulated rent of an apartment. Any\nregistration statement filed contemporaneously with a certification of service\nshall be presumed to have been served upon the tenant in occupancy. In no event\nshall the base date be prior to June 14, 2015. Absent an exception set forth in\n2506.1, if no base date can be determined subsequent to June 14,2015, the base\ndate shall be June 14, 2015. (2)\n\nReliable rent registration statement: A rent registration shall be considered\nto be reliable if, prior to the filing of such registration statement, and\nsubsequent to June 14, 2015, the rent history contains no unexplained increases\nin the rent. (b) The\ndivision shall consider all available reasonably necessary evidence when making\na determination as to the reliability of a rent registration statement, including but not limited to: (1)\nany rent\nregistration or other records filed with the state division of housing and\ncommunity renewal, or any other state, municipal or federal agency, regardless\nof the date to which the information on such registration refers; (2)\nany order issued by any state, municipal\nor federal agency; (3)\nany records\nmaintained by the owner or tenants; and\n(4)\nany public record kept in the regular\ncourse of business by any state, municipal or federal agency. (c) The division shall set the\nlegal regulated rent by adding any lawful rent increases and adjustments to the\nrent on the base date. (d) The\ndivision shall examine the rent prior to the base date and subsequent to June\n14, 2015 to make a determination as to: (1)\nwhether the legality of a rental amount charged or registered is reliable in\nlight of all available evidence including, but not limited, to whether an\nunexplained increase in the registered or lease rents, or a fraudulent scheme\nto destabilize the housing accommodation, rendered such rent or registration\nunreliable. (2)\nwhether an\naccommodation is subject to the emergency tenant protection act or the rent\nstabilization law; (3)\nwhether an\norder issued by the division of housing and community renewal or by a court, including, but not limited to an order issued pursuant to section\n2503.4\n(a) of this\n\nTitle, or any regulatory agreement or other contract with any governmental\nagency, and remaining in effect within six years of the filing of a complaint\npursuant to this section, affects or limits the amount of rent that may be\ncharged or collected; (4)\nwhether\nan overcharge was or was not willful; (5)\nwhether a rent adjustment that requires\ninformation regarding the length of occupancy by a present or prior tenant was\nlawful; (6)\nthe existence or terms\nand conditions of a preferential rent, or the propriety of a legal registered\nrent during a period when the tenants were charged a preferential\nrent; (7)\nthe legality of a rent\ncharged or registered immediately prior to the registration of a preferential\nrent; or\n(8)\nthe amount of the\nlegal regulated rent where the apartment was vacant or temporarily exempt on\nthe date six years prior to a tenant's complaint. (e) The division shall examine the rent prior\nto June 15, 2015, pursuant to section\n2506.1\nof this Part. (f) A tenant may file a complaint of\novercharge at any time. (g) An\nowner may, prior to the issuance of an order determining the existence of an\novercharge, file late registration statements. Provided that increases in the\nlegal regulated rent were lawful except for the failure to file a timely\nregistration, the owner, upon the service and filing of a late registration, shall not be found to have collected an overcharge at any time prior to the\nfiling of the late registration. (h) (1)\n\nAny\naffected tenant shall be given notice of and an opportunity to commence a\nsubsequent proceeding or an opportunity to join in any proceeding commenced by\nthe division pursuant to this section. (2)\n\nWhere a complainant pursuant to this\nsubdivision vacates the housing accommodation, and the division continues the\nproceeding, the division shall give any affected tenant notice of and an\nopportunity to commence a subsequent proceeding or an opportunity to join in\nsuch proceeding. (i) Damages\n(1)\n\nAny owner who is found by the\ndivision, after a reasonable opportunity to be heard, to have collected any\nrent or other consideration in excess of the collectable rent shall be ordered\nto pay to the tenant a penalty equal to three times the amount of such excess, except as provided in subdivision (f) of this section. If the owner establishes\nby a preponderance of the evidence that the overcharge was not willful, the\ndivision shall establish the penalty as the amount of the overcharge, plus\ninterest, which interest shall accrue from the date of the first overcharge on\nor after the base date, at the rate of interest payable on a judgment pursuant\nto section\n5004\nof the Civil Practice Law and Rules, and the order shall direct such a payment to be made to the tenant. (2)\n\nAny recovery of overcharge penalties, including treble damages, where appropriate, shall be limited to the six years\npreceding the complaint, provided, however, that there shall be no recovery of\ntreble damages for overcharges that occurred prior to June 15, 2017, and no\nrecovery of damages for overcharges that occurred prior to June 15, 2015. After\na complaint of rent overcharge has been filed and served on an owner, the\nvoluntary adjustment of the rent and/or the voluntary tender of a refund of\nrent overcharges shall not be considered by the division as evidence that the\novercharge was not willful. (3)\nA\npenalty of three times the overcharge may not be based upon an overcharge\nhaving occurred prior to April 1, 1984. (4)\n(i) Complaints filed prior to April 1, 1984 shall be determined in accordance with\nthe ETPA and this Title provisions in effect on March 31, 1984, except that an\novercharge collected on or after April 1, 1984 may be subject to treble damages\npursuant to this section. (ii)\n\nComplaints filed on or after April 1, 1984 and prior to June 14, 2019 shall be\ndetermined pursuant to section\n2506.1\nof this Part. (5)\n\nThe division shall determine\nthe owner's liability between or among two or more tenants found to have been\novercharged during their particular occupancy of a housing accommodation, and\nat its discretion, may require the owner to make diligent effects to locate\nprior tenants who are not parties to the proceeding, and to make refunds to\nsuch tenants or pay the amount of such penalty as a fine. (6)\n\nAn owner who is found to have overcharged\nby the division shall be assessed and ordered to pay as an additional penalty\nthe reasonable costs and attorney's fees of the proceeding, and except where\ntreble damages are awarded, interest from the date of the overcharge occurring\non or after April 1, 1984, at the rate of interest payable on a judgment\npursuant to section\n5004\nof the Civil Practice Law and\n\nRules. (7)\nA tenant may recover any\novercharge penalty established by the division by deducting it from the rent\ndue to the present owner at a rate not in excess of 20 percent of the amount of\nthe penalty for any one month's rent. If no such rent credit has been taken, the order of the division awarding penalties may be entered, filed and enforced\nby a tenant in the same manner as a judgment of the Supreme Court, on a form\nprescribed by the division, provided that the amount of the penalty exceeds\n$1,000 or the tenant is no longer in possession. Neither of these remedies are\navailable until the expiration of the period in which the owner may institute a\nproceeding pursuant to Part 2510.12 of this Title. (8)\n\nResponsibility for overcharges. (i) For overcharges collected prior to April\n1, 1984, an owner will be held responsible only for his or her portion of the\novercharges, in the absence of collusion or any relationship between such owner\nand any prior owners. (ii)\n(a) For overcharge complaints filed or\novercharges collected on or after April 1,1984, a current towner shall be\nresponsible for all overcharge penalties, including penalties based upon\novercharges collected by any prior owner. However, in the absence of collusion\nor any relationship between such owner and any prior owner, where no records\nsufficient to establish the legal regulated rent were provided at a judicial\nsale, or such other sale effected in connection with, or to resolve, in whole\nor in part, a bankruptcy proceeding, mortgage foreclosure action or other\njudicial proceeding, an owner who purchases upon or subsequent to such sale\nshall not be liable for overcharges collected by any owner prior to such sale, and treble damages upon overcharges that he or she collects which result from\novercharges collected by any owner prior to such sale. An owner who did not\npurchase at such sale, but who purchased subsequent to such sale, shall also\nnot be liable for overcharges collected by any prior owner subsequent to such\nsale to the extent that such overcharges are the result of overcharges\ncollected prior to such sale. (b) Court-appointed Receivers. A Receiver who is appointed by a court of competent\njurisdiction to receive rent for the use or occupation of a housing\naccommodation shall not, in the absence of collusion or any relationship\nbetween such Receiver and any owner or other Receiver, be liable for\novercharges collected by any owner or other Receiver, and treble damages upon\novercharges that he or she collects which result from overcharges collected by\nany owner or other Receiver, where records sufficient to establish the legal\nregulated rent have not been made available to such Receiver. Penalties\npursuant to this subdivision shall be subject to the time limitations set forth\nin paragraph (2) of subdivision (a) of this section. (9)\n\nThis subdivision shall not be\nconstrued to entitle a tenant to more than one refund for the same\novercharge. (j) Where no\nrent history for the housing accommodation is available, the rent shall be\ndetermined in the manner set forth in Section\n2509.2\nof this Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
