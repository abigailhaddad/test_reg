  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 1204.17 - Authorities and public benefit corporations\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhere a State authority or public benefit corporation\nparticipates in the construction of a new building or in the conversion, alteration, addition, or repair of an existing building and where upon its\ncompletion such building will be in the custody of an entity other than a State\nagency, administration and enforcement of the Uniform Code with respect to the\nconstruction, conversion, alteration, addition or repair will be the\nresponsibility of the code enforcement agency generally performing those\nfunctions at the location of the work. The responsibility of a local code\nenforcement agency may be suspended during the period of the work if, acting\npursuant to an express statutory grant, the authority or public benefit\ncorporation exercises such discretion. In that event, a construction-permitting\nagency will be responsible for administration and enforcement of the Uniform\n\nCode with regard to the particular project. If previously designated as a\nconstruction-permitting agency, the particular authority or public benefit\ncorporation participating in the project may serve as the agency responsible\nfor administration and enforcement of the code. A construction-permitting\nagency will be similarly responsible where the Uniform Code is applied in lieu\nof local building construction regulations. Upon completion of the work, administration and enforcement of the Uniform Code will revert to the local\nagency ordinarily responsible for same. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n1204.17\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
