  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 263.22 - Showing of interest\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Showing of interest to director of PEPR. All petitions for\ncertification, or motions to intervene, shall be accompanied by a showing of\ninterest. Such showing of interest shall be submitted with the petition, but\nshall not\nbe served on any other party. (1)\n\nSufficiency of showing of\ninterest. A showing of interest demonstrating majority support for an\nemployee organization shall be sufficient for certification without\nelection. (2)\nA showing of interest\nof at least 30 percent of employees in the unit alleged to be appropriate shall\nbe sufficient for the director of PEPR to order an election to determine\nemployees' choice, if any, of an exclusive representative for collective\nbargaining. (3)\n\nIn the event that\nthe showing of interest represents less than 30 percent of employees in the\nunit alleged to be appropriate, the director of PEPR shall dismiss the\npetition. (b) Confidentiality of showing of interest. All showings of\ninterest shall be kept confidential and shall not be disclosed to any of the\nparties named in the petition. (c) Selection of Employee Organization Where Only One Such Organization is\n\nInvolved. As permitted by section 705.1 -a of SERA, where the choice\navailable to employees in a negotiating unit is limited to selecting or\nrejecting a single labor organization, a showing of interest consisting of dues\ndeduction authorizations sufficient to demonstrate majority support for a\nsingle labor organization, along with a petition for certification, shall\nsuffice to warrant certification of said labor organization without\nelection. (d) Selection of\n\nEmployee Organization in General. As permitted by section 705.1 of\nSERA, a petition for certification may be accompanied by dues deduction\nauthorizations, individually signed petitions in favor of recognition, membership cards, or other evidence of support for or designation of the labor\norganization as collective bargaining representative. If the evidence is\nsufficient to demonstrate majority support of a single labor organization in a\nunit alleged to be appropriate, the labor organization shall be certified\nwithout an election. (e) Timeliness of showing of interest. All evidence submitted to\nestablish a showing of interest must be signed and dated within one year of\ntheir submission. A showing of interest may consist of any combination of the\nevidence set forth in sections\n263.22\n(c) and (d)\nof this Part. Designation cards shall be submitted in alphabetical order. The director of PEPR may require that an alphabetized\nlisting of the names of the signatories on individually signed and dated\npetitions be filed within a reasonable period of time after submission of the\nshowing of interest petitions. If such an alphabetized listing is required, the\nperson or persons filing the listing shall simultaneously file with the\ndirector of PEPR a signed declaration that the listing sets forth only the\nnames of the signatories on the showing of interest petitions. This listing is\nto be provided only to the director of PEPR or their designee, and\nshall\nnot\nbe provided to other parties. (f) Declaration of\nauthenticity. A declaration of authenticity shall be filed by the\npetitioner or, in the case of a motion to intervene, by the movant, simultaneously with the filing of the showing of interest. Declarations need\nnot be notarized or otherwise sworn. Such declaration shall contain the\nfollowing: (1)\nthe name of the individual\nexecuting the declaration and a statement of the declarant's authority to\nexecute it; and\n(2)\na declaration\nthat, upon the declarant's personal knowledge or upon the declarant's\ninquiries, the persons whose names appear on the evidence submitted have\nthemselves signed such evidence on the dates specified thereon, and that the\npersons specified as current members are in fact current members and that\ninquiry was made regarding their inclusion in the negotiating unit which is the\nsubject of the representation petition. If the declaration is upon inquiries\nthe declarant has made, and not upon the declarant's personal knowledge, the\ndeclarant shall specify the nature of those inquiries. (g) Investigation. If at any\npoint the hearing officer has a good faith question regarding the veracity of\nthe showing of interest, the hearing officer may conduct an investigation to\nascertain whether the evidence submitted is accurate. If it is determined after\ninvestigation that the evidence is fraudulent or that the declaration is false, such reasonable action as is appropriate to protect the integrity of the\nprocedures of the board in connection with the pending matter shall be taken. Such a determination and such action taken shall be reviewable by the board. Any exceptions shall be filed with the board within two days of the hearing\nofficer's determination. The board will grant such cases expedited\ntreatment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
