  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 185.3 - Failure to pay estimated tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 685(c)\n(a) Addition to tax. [Tax Law, § 685(c)(1)-(4)]\n(1)\n\nGeneral\n(i) Except as otherwise provided in section\n685\nof the Tax Law, in the case of any\nunderpayment of estimated tax by an individual, there shall be imposed an\naddition to the tax for the taxable year. (ii)\n\nSuch addition to the tax is determined\nby applying to the amount of the underpayment for the period of underpayment: (a) the applicable rate established under\nsection 697(j) of article 22 of the Tax Law (see Part 2393 of this Title); or\n(b) if no rate is set, the rate\nspecified in section\n685 (c)(1)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (2)\n\nAmount and period of underpayment. (i) The\namount of the underpayment is the excess of (\na\n) the required\ninstallment (see paragraph [4] of this subdivision) over (\nb\n)\nthe amount, if any, of the installment paid on or before the due date for the\ninstallment (see paragraph [3] of this subdivision). (ii)\n\nThe period of the underpayment will run\nfrom the due date of the required installment to whichever of the following\ndates is the earlier: (a) the 15th day of the\nfourth month following the close of the taxable year; or\n(b) with respect to any portion of the\nunderpayment, the date on which such portion is paid. For purposes of this\nclause, a payment of estimated tax will be credited against unpaid required\ninstallments in the order in which such installments are required to be\npaid. (3)\n\nNumber and due dates of required installments. (i) General. For purposes of this\nsubdivision, there will be four required installments for each taxable year. Generally, an individual must make such individual's first installment by April\n15th. Such individual may either pay all of the estimated tax at that time or\npay in four equal installments that are due on April 15th; June 15th; September\n15th; and January 15th of the following taxable year. (ii)\n\nIn some instances, such as a change in\nincome, deductions or exemptions, an individual may be required, in order to\navoid the addition to tax referred to in this subdivision, to make such\nindividual's first installment after April 15th. In such case, the installment\ndue dates are as follows: If such requirement is met\nafter: Installment due dates\nare: Percentage of Required Installment\n\nDue: March 31st and before June 1st\n\nJune 15, September 15th and January 15th of the\nfollowing taxable year. 50 percent due on June 15th, 25 percent due on\n\nSeptember 15th, and 25 percent due on January 15th of the following taxable\nyear. May 31st and before September 1st\n\nSeptember 15th and January 15th of the following\ntaxable year. 75 percent due on September 15th and 25 percent due\non January 15th of the following taxable year. August 31st\n\nJanuary 15th of the following taxable year. 100 percent due on January 15th of the following\ntaxable year. (4)\n\nRequired installment. (i) General. Except as provided in paragraph\n(5) of this subdivision, the amount of any required installment will be 25\npercent of the required annual payment. (ii)\n\nThe required annual payment for purposes\nof subparagraph (i) of this paragraph is the lesser of: (a) 90 percent of the tax shown on the return\nfor the taxable year (or, if no return is filed, 90 percent of the tax for such\nyear); or\n(b) 100 percent of the\ntax shown on the return of the individual for the preceding taxable year\n(provided such individual had filed a return for such year and such year was a\ntaxable year of 12 months). (5)\n\nLower required installment. (i) General. In the case of any required\ninstallment, if the individual establishes that such individual's annualized\nincome installment (see subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph) is less than the\nrequired installment determined under paragraph (4) of this subdivision (this\ncould occur if an individual did not receive such individual's taxable income\nevenly throughout the year): (a) the amount of\nsuch required installment will be the annualized income installment; and\n(b) any reduction in a required\ninstallment which results from the application of this paragraph will be\nrecaptured by increasing the amount of the next required installment determined\nunder paragraph (4) of this subdivision, by the amount of such reduction and by\nincreasing subsequent required installments to the extent that such reduction\nhas not previously been recaptured under this clause. (ii)\n\nThe annualized income installment, in\nthe case of any required installment, is the excess, if any, of: (a) an amount equal to the applicable\npercentage of the tax for the taxable year computed by placing on an annualized\nbasis the taxable income and minimum taxable income for months in the taxable\nyear ending before the due date for the installment, over\n(b) the aggregate amount of any prior\nrequired installments for the taxable year. The applicable percentage of tax, which will be computed without regard to any increase in the rates applicable\nto the taxable year unless such increase was enacted at least 30 days prior to\nthe due date of the installment, will be as follows: Required\ninstallments\n\nApplicable\npercentage\n1st installment\n221/2 percent\n2nd installment\n45 percent\n3rd installment\n671/2 percent\n4th installment\n90 percent\n\nThe provisions of this subparagraph, with respect to\ndetermining an individual's annualized income installment for each installment\nperiod, can be illustrated as follows: Step 1: Annualized the taxable income and minimum taxable\nincome for the months in the taxable year ending before the due date of the\ninstallment period and compute the tax due on this amount. Step 2: Multiply the tax computed in Step 1 by: 221/2\npercent if the payment due date is April 15th; 45 percent if the payment due\ndate is June 15th; 671/2 percent if the payment due date is September 15th; or\n90 percent if the payment due date is January 15th of the following taxable\nyear. Step 3: Figure the total of the required installments or\nannualized income installments for the preceding payment periods and subtract\nthis amount from the amount in Step 2. Step 4: The result of Step 3 is the annualized income\ninstallment for the applicable installment period. If the annualized income installment for the installment\nperiod is less than the required installment, the individual need only pay such\nannualized income installment. (b) Definitions. [Tax Law, § 685(c)(5)(A)] For purposes of this section\nand section\n185.4\nof this Part, the term\ntax\nmeans: (1)\nthe tax imposed under article 22 of the\n\nTax Law; minus\n(2)\n(i) the credits allowed against these taxes, other than the credit under section\n673\nof the Tax Law relating to tax withheld\non wages (see Part 173 of this Title). (ii)\n\nThe credit for the taxable year under\nsection\n673\nof the Tax Law (see Part 173 of this\n\nTitle) is deemed to be a payment of estimated tax. An equal part of such amount\nis deemed paid on each installment due date for such taxable year. However, if\na taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, the amounts to withheld are deemed to be payments of estimated tax on the dates\non which such amounts were actually withheld. (c) Rule for returns filed on or before\n\nJanuary 31st. [Tax Law, § 685(c)(5)(B)] If, on or before January 31st\nof the following taxable year: (1)\na\ntaxpayer files a return for the taxable year and pays in full the amount\ncomputed on the return as payable; then\n(2)\nno addition to tax will be imposed under\nsection\n685 (c)\nof the Tax Law (see\nsubdivision [a] of this section) with respect to any underpayment of the fourth\nrequired installment for the taxable year. (d) Rules for farmers and\nfishermen. [Tax Law, § 685(c)(5)(C)]\n(1)\n(i) General. If an individual is a farmer or fisherman (see subparagraph [ii] of\nthis paragraph) for any taxable year: (a) there will be only one required installment for the taxable year; (b) the due date for such installment will be\n\nJanuary 15th of the following taxable year; (c) the amount of such installment will be\nthe required annual payment determined as follows: (1)\n66\n2\n/\n3\npercent of the tax\nshown on the return for the taxable year (or, if no return is filed, 66\n2\n/\n3\npercent of the tax for\nsuch year); or\n(2)\n100 percent of\nthe tax shown on the return of the individual for the preceding taxable year\n(provided such individual had filed a return for such year and such year was a\ntaxable year of 12 months); (d) the provisions of subdivision (c) of this\nsection (Rule for returns filed on or before January 31st) will be applied by: (1)\nsubstituting March 1st for January 31st; and\n(2)\ntreating the required\ninstallment described in clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph as\nthe fourth required installment. (ii)\n\nAn individual is a farmer or fisherman, for purposes of this subdivision, for any taxable year, if such individual's\n\nNew York adjusted gross income from farming (see paragraph [2] of this\nsubdivision) or fishing (see paragraph [3] of this subdivision) is: (a) at least two thirds of such individual's\ntotal New York adjusted gross income from all sources for the taxable year; or\n(b) at least two thirds of such\nindividual's total New York adjusted gross income from all sources shown on\nsuch individual's return for the preceding taxable year. (2)\n\nFarming, New York adjusted\ngross income from farming is the income resulting from oyster farming, the\ncultivation of the soil, the raising or harvesting of any agriculture or\nhorticultural commodities and the raising of livestock, bees or poultry. In\nother words, the requisite percentage of New York adjusted gross income must be\nderived from the operations of a stock, dairy, poultry, fruit or truck farm, or\nfrom a plantation, ranch, nursery, orchard or oyster bed. If an individual\nreceives for the use of his land income in the form of a share of the crops\nproduced thereon, such income is from farming. (3)\n\nFishing. New York adjusted gross income\nfrom fishing is the income resulting from the catching, harvesting, cultivating, or farming of any kind of fish, shellfish (for example, clams and\nmussels), crustacea (for example, lobsters, crabs and shrimp), sponges, seaweeds or other aquatic forms of animal and vegetable life. Income from\nfishing includes the income received by an officer or member of the crew of a\nvessel while the vessel is engaged in any such activity, whether or not the\nofficer or member of the crew is himself so engaged, and, in the case of an\nindividual who is engaged in any such activity in the employ of any person, it\nincludes the income received by such individual from such employment. In\naddition, income received for services performed as an ordinary incident to any\nsuch activity is income from fishing. Similarly, for example, income from\nfishing includes income received from the shore services of an officer or\nmember of the crew of a vessel engaged in any such activity, if such services\nare an ordinary incident to any such activity. Services performed as an\nordinary incident to such activities include, for example, services performed\nin such cleaning, icing and packing of fish as are necessary for the immediate\npreservation of the catch. (e) Fiscal years. [Tax Law, § 685(c)(5)(D)] The provisions of this section\napply to a taxable year other than a calendar year by the substitution of the\ncorresponding fiscal year months for the calendar months referred to in this\nsection. Therefore in the case of an individual on a fiscal year basis, the\ndates prescribed for payment of installments of estimated tax will be the 15th\nday of the fourth month, the 15th day of the sixth month, the 15th day of the\nninth month of the taxable year and the 15th day of the first month of the\nsucceeding taxable year. For example, if an individual having a fiscal year\nending on June 30th, first met the requirements (in order to avoid the addition\nto tax referred to in subdivision (a) of this section) to pay estimated tax on\n\nJanuary 15th, the estimated tax should have been paid in two equal\ninstallments, one on March 15th and the other on or before July 15th; unless\nsuch individual elected to pay the full amount due on the due date of the first\ninstallment, March 15th. (f) Short taxable year. [Tax Law, § 685(c)(5)(E)]\n(1)\n(i) General. Installments of estimated tax may not be made for a period of more\nthan 12 months. For purposes of this subdivision, a taxable year of 52 or 53\nweeks is deemed to be a period of 12 months. If a taxpayer must make\ninstallments of estimated tax in order to avoid the addition to tax referred to\nin subdivision (a) of this section and a short taxable year is involved (see\nsections\n105.1\nthrough\n105.3\nof this Title), separate installments of estimated tax for such fractional part\nof the year will be due, except as otherwise provided in section\n185.4\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nFor purposes of\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the estimated tax is to be paid in equal\ninstallments. (a) If the requirement to pay\nestimated tax in order to avoid the addition to tax referred to in subdivision\n(a) of this section is met on or before the first day of the fourth month of\nthe short taxable year, the installment due dates are: the 15th day of the\nfourth month of such taxable year, the 15th day of the sixth month of such\ntaxable year, the 15th day of the ninth month of such taxable year (unless the\nshort taxable year closed prior to such sixth or ninth month, in which case the\nrespective installment will be eliminated) and the 15th day of the first month\nof the succeeding taxable year. (b) If the requirement to pay estimated tax in order to avoid the addition to tax\nreferred to in subdivision (a) of this section is met after the first day of\nthe fourth month but before the second day of the sixth month of the short\ntaxable year, the installment due dates are: the 15th day of the sixth month of\nsuch taxable year, the 15th day of the ninth month of such taxable year (unless\nthe short taxable year closed prior to such ninth month, in which case the\ninstallment will be eliminated) and the 15th day of the first month of the\nsucceeding taxable year. (c) If the\nrequirement to pay estimated tax in order to avoid the addition to tax referred\nto in subdivision (a) of this section is met after the first day of the sixth\nmonth but before the second day of the ninth month of the short taxable year, the installment due dates are: the 15th day of the ninth month of such taxable\nyear and the 15th day of the first month of the succeeding taxable\nyear. (d) If, however, the period\nfor which installments of estimated tax are due is: (1)\nat least four months but less than six\nmonths; (2)\nat least six months but\nless than nine months and the requirement to pay estimated tax in order to\navoid the addition to tax referred to in subdivision (a) of this section is not\nmet until after the first day of the fourth month; or\n(3)\none of nine months or more and such\nrequirement is not met until after the first day of the sixth month, the\ninstallment of estimated tax may be paid in one installment on or before the\n15th day of the succeeding taxable year. Example 1: Assume an individual's short taxable year is the period\nof 10 months from January 1, 1990 to October 31, 1990 and such individual met\nthe requirement to pay estimated tax in order to avoid the addition to tax\nreferred to in subdivision (a) of this section on or before April 1, 1990. Such\nestimated tax is payable in four equal installments: due on April 15th, June\n15th, September 15th and November 15th. Example 2: Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that the\nrequirement to pay estimated tax in order to avoid the addition to tax referred\nto in subdivision (a) of this section was met on April 30, 1990. Such estimated\ntax is payable in three equal installments: due on June 15th, September 15th\nand November 15th. (2)\n\nIn the case of a short taxable year of a\nfarmer or fisherman who is required to pay estimated tax in order to avoid the\naddition to tax referred to in subdivision (a) of this section, the installment\nis due on or before the 15th day of the month immediately following the close\nof the short taxable year. (g) Joint estimated tax of husband and\nwife. [Tax Law, § 685(c)(5)(F)]\n(1)\n\nGeneral. A husband and wife may make the\nrequired annual payment determined under subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (4) of\nsubdivision (a) of this section as if they were one taxpayer. If joint\ninstallments of estimated tax are made by such husband and wife, the liability\ndetermined under paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of this section is joint and\nseveral. While joint installments may be made by a husband and wife, even\nthough they are not living together, no such installments may be made if such\nhusband and wife are separated under a decree of divorce or separate\nmaintenance, or if they have different taxable years. If joint installments are\nmade, the tax, as defined in subdivision (b) of this section, must be estimated\nas if a joint New York State personal income tax return will be filed for the\ntaxable year. (2)\n\nApplication to\nseparate New York State personal income tax returns. The fact that joint\ninstallments of estimated tax are made by a husband and wife will not preclude\nthem from filing separate New York State personal income tax returns. Where\njoint installments of estimated tax are made but joint New York State personal\nincome tax returns are not filed for the same taxable year, the estimated tax\ninstallments for such year may be treated as installments on account of the tax\n(as defined in subdivision (b) of this section) liability of either the husband\nor wife for the taxable year or may be divided between them in such manner as\nthey may agree. In the event the husband and wife fail to agree to a division, the portion of such installments allocated to a spouse will be that portion of\nthe aggregate of all such installments of estimated tax made, as the amount of\ntax (as defined in subdivision (b) of this section) shown on the separate New\n\nYork State personal income tax return of the taxpayer bears to the sum of the\ntaxes (as defined in subdivision (b) of this section) shown on the separate New\n\nYork State personal income tax returns of the taxpayer and such taxpayer's\nspouse. (3)\n\nDeath of a spouse. (i) If joint installments of estimated tax\nare made by a husband and wife and thereafter one spouse dies, no further\ninstallments of estimated tax are required from the estate of the decedent. (An\nestate is not required, in order to avoid the addition to tax referred to in\nsubdivision (a) of this section, to make estimated tax payments for the first\ntwo taxable years after the date of the death of the decedent. See subdivision\n(h) of this section.) The surviving spouse, however, may either continue to\nmake joint installments of estimated tax or such spouse may make separate\ninstallments of estimated tax. If a surviving spouse elects to make separate\ninstallments of estimated tax and in the event a joint New York State personal\nincome tax return is not filed, the joint installments previously made, may be\ndivided between the decedent and the surviving spouse in such proportion as the\nsurviving spouse and the legal representative of the decedent may\nagree. (ii)\n\nIn the absence of such\nagreement, if separate New York State personal income tax returns are filed by\nor on behalf of both the decedent and surviving spouse, the joint installments\nof estimated tax made up to the date of death will be allocated to each New\n\nYork State personal income tax return in the proportion that the amount of the\ntax (as defined in subdivision (b) of this section) shown on the separate New\n\nYork State personal income tax return bears to the tax (as defined in\nsubdivision (b) of this section) shown the on such separate New York State\npersonal income tax returns of the surviving spouse and of the decedent. If\nsuch separate New York State personal income tax returns are filed by or on\nbehalf of each spouse and both New York State personal income tax returns\ndisclose no tax (as defined in subdivision (b) of this section) liability or if\na separate New York State personal income tax return is not filed by or on\nbehalf of either spouse, the aggregate amount of such installments will be\nequally divided. (h) Estates and trusts. (1)\n\nGeneral. Certain estates and all trusts are required, in order to\navoid the addition to tax referred to in subdivision (a) of this section, to\nmake estimated tax payments in the same manner as individuals. (2)\n\nEstates. This section shall apply to an estate only with respect\nto any taxable year ending two or more years after the date of the decedent's\ndeath. (3)\n\nTrusts. (i) The trustee may elect to treat any amount\nof estimated tax payments made by the trust for any taxable year of the trust\nas a payment made by a beneficiary or beneficiaries where the following\nconditions are met: (a) the payments of\nestimated tax made by the trust for the taxable year exceed the tax shown as\ndue on such trust's return for the same taxable year; and\n(b) such election is made on the New York\n\nState fiduciary income tax return of such trust that is filed within 65 days\nafter the end of the taxable year for which the election is being\nmade. (ii)\n\nWhere the\nelection in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph is made, the beneficiary who is\ntreated as making the estimated tax payment is deemed to receive a distribution\non the last day of the trust's taxable year, and is deemed to make a payment of\nestimated tax on the January 15th following the end of such beneficiary's\ntaxable year in which such payment was made. (i) Amended installments. In making an installment of estimated tax, the taxpayer\nis required to take into account the then existing facts and circumstances, as\nwell as those reasonably to be anticipated, relating to the computation of tax\n(as defined in subdivision [b] of this section) due for the taxable year. Amended installments of estimated tax may be made in any case in which such\ntaxpayer estimates such taxpayer's tax (as defined in subdivision [b] of this\nsection) due for the taxable year will differ from the tax (as defined in\nsubdivision [b] of this section) due for the taxable year reflected in such\ntaxpayer's previous installment(s) of estimated tax. However, an amended\ninstallment of estimated tax may be made only as of an installment date and no\nfurther amendment may be made until a succeeding installment date. An amended\njoint instalment of estimated tax may be made by a husband and wife even though\nseparate installments have previously been made. No refund will be issued\nbecause of an amended installment of estimated tax as consideration will be\ngiven to a refund only in connection with a completed New York State personal\nincome tax return filed by a taxpayer for the taxable year covered by such\ntaxpayer's installments of estimated tax. (j) Partnerships. Partnerships are not required to make installments of\nestimated tax. However, partners are required, in order to avoid the addition\nto tax referred to in subdivision (a) of this section, to make installments of\nestimated tax in their individual capacity, taking into consideration their\nestimated distributive shares of income or gains from such partnerships. See\nalso subdivision (k) of this section with regard to combined installments of\nestimated tax in the case of electing nonresident partners. (k) Group required installments. (1)\n\nPartnerships. (i) Any partnership, including a limited\nliability partnership or a limited liability company that is treated as a\npartnership for Federal tax purposes, hereinafter referred to as a partnership\nelecting to make group required installments (see paragraph [a][4] of of this\nsection) on behalf of 35 or more electing qualified nonresident partners (for\nthe definition of a \"qualified nonresident partner\" see section\n151.17\n[c]\nof this Title) or a limited liability company members hereinafter referred to\nin this section as partners, must first obtain permission from the Department\nof Taxation and Finance to file a group New York State nonresident personal\nincome tax return for such nonresident partners in accordance with the\nrequirements and conditions described in section\n151.17\nof this Title. (ii)\n(a) A partnership must make such group\nrequired installments on forms and in the manner prescribed by the Department\nof Taxation and Finance. The group required installments must contain the name\nand address of the partnership and the same special identifying number assigned\nto the partnership by the department for the purpose of filing a group New York\n\nState nonresident personal income tax return. (b) A partnership must also attach a detailed\nschedule to the first group installment showing: (1)\nthe name of the partnership; (2)\nthe special identifying number; (3)\nthe taxable year for which the group\ninstallment is being made; and\n(4)\nthe names (in columnar form and in alphabetical order by last name or other\norder acceptable to the Department of Taxation and Finance), address, social\nsecurity numbers and amounts of estimated tax of the participating\npartners. (2)\n\nNonresident professional athletes. (i) Any professional athletic team electing\nto make group installments (see paragraph [a][4] of this section) on behalf of\nits electing qualified nonresident members (for the definition of a \"qualified\nmember of a professional athletic team\" see section\n151.18\n[b][3]\nof this Title) must first obtain permission from the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance to file a group New York State nonresident personal income tax return\nfor such nonresident members in accordance with the requirements and conditions\ndescribed in section\n151.18\nof this Title. (ii)\n(a) A professional athletic team must make\nsuch group required installments on forms and in the manner prescribed by the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. The group required installments must\ncontain the name and address of the professional team and the same special\nidentifying number assigned to such team by the department for the purpose of\nfiling a group New York State nonresident personal income tax return. (b) The first group installment must include\na detailed schedule showing: (1)\nthe name and\naddress of the professional team; (2)\nthe special identifying number; (3)\nthe taxable year for which the group\ninstallment is being made; and\n(4)\nthe names (in columnar form and in alphabetical order by last name or other\norder acceptable to the Department of Taxation and Finance), addresses, social\nsecurity numbers and amounts of estimated tax of the participating\nmembers. (3)\n\nThe rules pertaining to group required\ninstallments for partnerships, as provided by paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, shall be applicable, in their entirety, to New York S corporations\nand any other authorized groups or organizations electing to make group\nrequired installments. The provisions of such paragraph shall apply in the same\nmanner and effect as if such provisions had been incorporated in full in this\nparagraph, except where inconsistent or irrelevant, and as if the language\ntherein had expressly referred to New York S corporations and shareholders\nthereof or such other authorized groups or organizations and their members, rather than partnerships and partners. (l) Place for paying required\ninstallments. The required installments, for purposes of this section, are to be remitted to the address furnished in the forms and instructions for\npayment of estimated tax issued by the New York State Department of Taxation\nand Finance. (m) Application with respect to taxes administered by the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance. The provisions of this section and section\n185.4\nof this Part are separately applicable to the taxes imposed pursuant to the\nauthority of articles 30, 30-A and 30-B of the Tax Law and article 2-E of the\n\nGeneral City Law.
