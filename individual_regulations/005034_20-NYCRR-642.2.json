  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 642.2 - Imposition of the additional tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 253(2)\n(a) In addition to the tax imposed by\nsubdivision 1 of section\n253\nof\nthe tax law imposes the additional tax upon the recording of each mortgage on\nreal property located in this State, recorded on or after July 1, 1969, at a\nrate of 25 cents for each $100 and each remaining major fraction thereof of\nprincipal debt or obligation which is, or under any contingency may be secured\nat the date of execution of the mortgage or at any time thereafter. (b) Residential property\ndeduction. (1)\n\nIn any case where a\nmortgage subject to the additional tax is of real property which is principally\nimproved or is to be principally improved by a one- or two-family residence or\ndwelling, the first $10,000 of principal debt to obligation secured by such\nmortgage shall be deducted from the total principal debt to obligation secured\nby such mortgage and the additional tax shall be computed on the amount\nremaining. Such deduction shall apply notwithstanding that part of the\nmortgaged property is located in one or more counties which have suspended the\ntax as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section. (2)\n\nProof of deduction. (i) For purposes of claiming the deduction\nprovided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, there shall be submitted to the\nrecording officer of the county where the mortgage is first recorded, either in\nthe mortgage instrument or by separate affidavit by the mortgagor, the\nmortgagee or any other person who has knowledge of the facts, a statement that\nthe real property covered by the mortgage is improved or will be improved by a\none- or two-family residence or dwelling and that there are or will be no other\nimprovements, the cost of fair market value of which exceeds or will exceed the\ncost of fair market value of the one- or two- family residence or dwelling. In\naddition to the statement submitted to the recording officer, the commissioner\nmay require the mortgagor, the mortgagee or any other person who has knowledge\nof the facts to furnish by affidavit such other information or data as deemed\nnecessary for purposes of claiming such deduction. (ii)\n\nWhere the real property covered by the\nmortgage contains or will contain other improvements, the cost or fair market\nvalue of which is in excess of the cost or fair market value of the one- or\ntwo-family residence or dwelling, the real property shall not be deemed to be\nprincipally improved by such one- or two-family residence or dwelling and the\ndeduction shall not apply. (iii)\n\nThe cost of each improvement may be used to determine whether the deduction may\nbe taken, except where the cost of any improvement is not known, then the fair\nmarket value of such improvement shall be used. (c) Suspension of tax. (1)\n(i) Except in the counties specified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the\nimposition of the additional tax may be suspended by a county for any period of\ntime, not less than one year, specified in a local law, ordinance or resolution\nduly adopted by the local legislative body of such county. A certified copy of\nsuch local law, ordinance or resolution shall be filed with the commissioner\nand with the State Comptroller. (ii)\n\nThe suspension of such tax shall apply\nonly with respect to mortgages of property within such county or, where the\nmortgaged property is located in more than one county, to that part of the\nprincipal debt or obligation which bears the same proportion to the entire\nprincipal debt or obligation as the assessed value of such property located in\nsuch county bears to the assessed value of the entire mortgaged\nproperty. (2)\n\nThe\nadditional tax may not be suspended in any of the following counties: (i) counties comprising the Metropolitan\n\nCommuter Transportation District, as defined by section\n1262\nof the Public Authorities\n\nLaw; (ii)\ncounties comprising the\n\nNiagara Frontier Transportation District, as defined by section\n1299-b\nof the Public Authorities\n\nLaw; (iii)\ncounties comprising the\n\nRochester-Genesee Transportation District, as defined by section\n1299-cc\nof the\n\nPublic Authorities Law; (iv)\ncounties comprising the Capital District Transportation District, as defined by\nsection\n1302\nof the Public Authorities Law; and\n(v) counties comprising the\n\nCentral New York Regional Transportation District, as defined by section\n1327\nof the Public Authorities\n\nLaw. (d) Payment of tax where mortgaged real property is situated in more than one\ncounty. (1)\n\nThe additional tax shall\nbe paid to the recording officer of the county in which the mortgage is first\nrecorded, notwithstanding that such county is one which has suspended the\nadditional tax as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and\nnotwithstanding that the recording officer of such county is not required to\ncollect any additional tax with respect to mortgaged property located in that\ncounty. (2)\n\nWhere a mortgage\nsubject to the taxes described in this Part covers real property located in\nmore than one county, and one or more but not all of such counties have\nsuspended the additional tax as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the taxes as described in this Part shall be paid, at the election of the\ntaxpayer, by one of the following procedures: (i) Procedure 1. The taxpayer may compute the\ntax as if the property was located entirely in any one of such counties that it\nis authorized to collect the greatest amount of tax. Such amount is then paid\nto the recording officer of the county where the mortgage is first recorded. Such recording officer indorses upon the mortgage the tax so paid. Also, at the\ntime the taxpayer presents the mortgage for recording and pays the tax, the\ntaxpayer should present to the recording officer a completed form\nMT-15.1-Mortgage Recording Tax Claim for Refund. The taxpayer then can proceed\nto record the mortgage in any other county where the property or any other part\nthereof is located. The recording officer will submit information to the\ndepartment with respect to the relative assessed values of the property located\nin each county, along with form MT-15.1, for the purpose of determining the\nproper total tax due and the amount of such tax to be apportioned to each\ncounty. If it is determined that the tax was overpaid, the commissioner, or a\nduly authorized delegate, will direct the appropriate recording officer to\nrefund the amount of the overpayment to the taxpayer or his duly authorized\nrepresentative. If the taxpayer fails to present a completed refund claim form\n(form MT-15.1) to the recording officer at the time the mortgage was first\nrecorded, the taxpayer may file for a refund directly with the department. The\nrefund application must be filed with the department within two years from the\ntime that the erroneous payment of tax occurred. If there is an underpayment of\nthe tax, the commissioner will direct the recording officer where the mortgage\nwas first recorded and the tax paid to notify the parties to the mortgage of\nsuch underpayment. (ii)\n\nProcedure\n2. At the time the mortgage is presented for recording the taxpayer may file a\ncompleted form MT-15-Mortgage Recording Tax Return. The taxpayer will pay the\namount of tax computed to be due on form MT-15, or as adjusted by the recording\nofficer, to the recording officer of the county where the mortgage is first\nrecorded. The recording officer will indorse the payment of the tax upon the\nmortgage so that the mortgage can be recorded without further payment of tax in\nthe other county or counties. The recording officer must submit the original of\nthe return (form MT-15), along with the information described in procedure\nnumber one, to the department. The return filed pursuant to this procedure\nshall be subject to audit by the department and also by the recording officer\nwhere the mortgage was first recorded and the tax paid. If there is an\nunderpayment of the tax, the commissioner will direct the recording officer\nwhere the mortgage was first recorded and the tax paid to notify the parties to\nthe mortgage of such underpayment. If there is an overpayment of the tax, the\ncommissioner shall direct the appropriate recording officer to refund the\namount of overpayment to the taxpayer or his duly authorized\nrepresentative. (3)\n\nWhere a mortgage covers real property located partly within and partly without\nthe State and the property within the State is in two or more counties, some\nbut not all of which have suspended the tax as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of\nthis section, the portion of the principal debt or obligation secured or which\nunder any contingency may be secured by such mortgage which is subject to the\ntaxes described in Part 642 of this Title, and which shall be used for purposes\nof following procedure 1 or procedure 2 as described in this section, must be\ndetermined in accordance with the provisions of Part 649 of this\n\nTitle. (4)\n\nWhere the additional tax\nis suspended in all of the counties in which the mortgaged property is located\nor is in effect in all of the counties in which the mortgaged property is\nlocated, the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision shall not apply\nand the recording officer shall compute the amount of tax due; provided, however, that the recording officer shall submit a statement to the\ncommissioner requesting apportionment in any case where the mortgaged property\nis located in more than one tax district, and further provided that an\napplication for a determination of the tax prior to recording may be made in\nany case where the property is located partly within and partly without the\n\nState.
