  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-4.8 - Rules for intermediary transactions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In the case of intermediary transactions, in applying the where benefit received method or the delivery destination\nmethod of the hierarchy, the location where the receipt is apportioned is based\non the location of the consumers, rather than the business customer. If the\ncorporation uses reasonable approximation based on the sourced receipts method\nto apportion its receipts from an intermediary transaction, it must apply that\nmethod only taking transactions with that particular business customer into\nconsideration. (b) In determining\nwhere the benefit is received or the delivery destination, the corporation is\nrequired to make inquiries to the business customer, but not to the consumers, regardless of the number of business customers the corporation has or the\npercentage of receipts from any one business customer, in order to determine\nthe amount of receipts to apportion to New York State based on the location of\nthe consumers. Such inquiries may be fulfilled by the business customer\nproviding information from its books and records to the corporation that\ndemonstrates the relevant information. (c) If, after exercising due diligence, the\ncorporation has inadequate information to determine the location of the\nconsumers, the corporation should determine where the benefit is received or\ndelivery destination based on the business customer. If, after exercising due\ndiligence, the corporation has inadequate information to determine the location\nof either the consumers or the business customer, the corporation must then use\nthe preceding taxable year method (see section\n4-4.9\nof this Subpart). (d) This section does not apply in instances\nwhere the business address presumption applies. In instances where the business\naddress presumption applies, the receipts shall be apportioned to the billing\naddress of the business customer. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n4-4.8\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
