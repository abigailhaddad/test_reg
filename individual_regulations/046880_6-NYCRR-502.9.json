Tit. 6 § 502.9 - Variance provisions relating to certain facilities and lands owned or formerly owned by the state\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Variances to the provisions of section\n502.4\nof this Part may be granted\nby the department to any person who has acquired or who proposed to acquire\nlands or facilities owned or formerly owned by the State, where the deed or\nother instrument of transfer contains a covenant or use restriction placed upon\nsuch lands or facilities by the State at the time of disposition. Any person\nseeking relief from such covenant and use restrictions may submit a written\nrequest to the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation at 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233, and include the following information: (1)\nthe name and address of the\npetitioner; (2)\na copy of the deed\nor other instrument of transfer which includes the full text of the covenant or\nuse restriction; (3)\na copy of maps\nor drawings, to suitable scale, which clearly identify the location of the\nproperty with existing or proposed improvements shown thereon; (4)\na description of the proposed uses for\nthe property; (5)\na detailed text\nclearly indicating the basis for the petitioner's claim of unnecessary\nhardships and/or practical difficulties in the way of complying with the\nrequirements imposed by the covenant and use restrictions; and\n(6)\nany other information that the\ncommissioner deems necessary to make a finding pursuant to subdivision (d) of\nthis section, based upon the standards contained in subdivision (e) of this\nsection. (b) The\nprocedures for the submission of requests for variances under this section, time periods for department action thereon, provisions relating to minor\nprojects, and notice and hearing requirements, shall be governed by the\nprovisions of Part 621 of this Title. A copy of the department's decision shall\nbe sent by mail to the petitioner requesting the subject variance and to the\nchief administrative officer of each city, town or village in which the\nproperty is located. The granting of any variance pursuant to this section\nshall not be construed as relieving any person from obtaining any other\nnecessary approval(s) from any Federal, State or local government\nbody. (c) Variances shall not be\ngranted for any project or activity within any designated regulatory floodway, if any increase in flood levels would result during the base flood\ndischarge. (d) A variance may be\ngranted or denied by the commissioner based upon information submitted by the\npetitioner and other resources available to the department. The granting of a\nvariance pursuant to this section may contain such conditions or limitations as\nmay be deemed reasonably necessary to assure that the spirit of the act shall\nbe observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice\ndone. (e) Standards for the\ngranting of a variance. (1)\n\nThe petitioner\nshall establish to the satisfaction of the commissioner that he will suffer an\nunnecessary hardship if the variance is not granted, or that there are\npractical difficulties in the way of carrying out the strict letter of the\nrequirements of the covenant and use restriction. In the absence of a\nsatisfactory showing of good and sufficient cause, no variance will be\nissued. (2)\n\nThe basis for the\ngranting of a variance shall be a determination that the petitioner has\nestablished: (i) that the proposed project or\nuse of such lands is consistent with the findings and purposes of the New York\n\nState Legislature as expressed in section\n36-0101\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law; and\n(ii)\nthat the\npublic safety and welfare will be secured and substantial justice\ndone.
