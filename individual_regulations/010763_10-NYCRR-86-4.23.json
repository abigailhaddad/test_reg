Funding shall mean the transfer of monies to the funded accounts. Board-designated funds and the accrual of liabilities to the funded depreciation accounts shall not be recognized as funding of depreciation. Deposits to the funded depreciation accounts must remain in such accounts for six months or more to be considered as valid funding transactions unless expended for the purposes for which the account was funded. (2)\n\nFunding for plant and fixed equipment shall mean that the transfer of monies to the funded accounts shall occur by the end of the fiscal period in which the depreciation is recorded. (3)\n\nDepreciation on major movable equipment shall be funded in the year revenue is received from the reimbursement of each expense and in the amount included in reimbursement for that year.

(f) Article 43 corporations may elect to include in their reimbursement rates depreciation computed by a method other than that used in subdivisions (b), (c) and (d) of this section, subject to approval of the commissioner.
