  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 515.3 - Non-judicial punishment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. Where a commander determines that non-judicial punishment is the\nappropriate vehicle for dealing with an offense, he will resort to section\n130.15\nof the Military Law of the State of New York. This section is the\nfunctional equivalent of article 15 of the UCMJ. Such proceedings are governed\nby Part 519 of this Title. (b) Who\nmay impose section\n130.15\npunishment. A company grade officer in command may\nimpose nonjudicial punishment as outlined by regulation. If a company grade\nofficer does not feel that company grade punishment is adequate for the\noffense, the case should be forwarded to the field grade commander with a\nrequest that the field grade commander exercise authority under the provisions\nof section\n130.15. See Appendix L-2, Request to Superior to Exercise Article 15\n\nJurisdiction, DMNA form 1058. The company grade commander may not recommend\npunishment. As appropriate, the field grade commander may return the case to\nthe company grade commander for disposition. A superior may not direct a\nsubordinate commander to take action or dictate the type of punishment to be\nimposed. A field grade commander may impose punishment as outlined by\nregulation. A general or flag officer may impose punishment as outlined by\nregulation. (c) No right to demand\ncourts-martial. National Guard enlisted personnel whether on orders under title\n32, United States Code, or State active duty under the New York State Military\n\nLaw may not demand trial by court-martial in lieu of non-judicial\npunishment.
