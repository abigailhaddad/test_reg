Upon such withdrawal, the membership of such member\nshall terminate and all rights in the system enjoyed by such member shall\ncease. In the event a Tier 3 membership shall terminate, other than as a result\nof transfer to another public employer, any contributions remaining to the\ncredit of the member shall be refunded upon filing an application for such\nrefund with the system. If the refund is paid as a result of the death of the\nmember, his contributions shall be refunded to his designated beneficiary on\nfile with the system or, in the absence of such nomination, to the member's\nestate. (b) A person whose Tier 4 or\n5 membership is terminated other than as a result of transfer, retirement or\ndeath, or a Tier 4 or 5 member who has not accumulated at least 10 years of\ncredited service and who no longer is employed by a participating employer of\nthis system in a position upon which his membership is based, may withdraw his\nmember contributions by filing a written demand for withdrawal of contributions\nand membership with the system. Upon such withdrawal, the membership of such\nmember shall terminate and all rights in the system enjoyed by such member\nshall cease. Upon the death of a person whose membership previously terminated\ndue to lack of credited service and who did not withdraw his member\ncontributions, or upon the death of a member, provided a death benefit pursuant\nto section\n607\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw is not paid, the member contributions of such person shall be refunded to\nsuch person as he shall have nominated to receive a death benefit by written\ndesignation duly executed and filed with the system, or, in the absence of such\ndesignation, to his estate. For purposes of such refunds, interest shall be\ncredited at the rate of five percent per annum compounded annually to the date\nof termination of membership. Provided, however, if a death benefit is paid\npursuant to section\n607\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, such benefit shall be in lieu of the refund of such contributions, however, in no event shall such death benefit be less than the amount payable\npursuant to this subdivision. (c) Whenever a Tier 3, 4 or 5 member for whom a loan is outstanding becomes\nentitled to a refund of his or her contributions because of withdrawal from the\nsystem or death (in the case of an uninsured loan), the amount of any loan\noutstanding on such date, including accrued interest, shall be construed to\nalready have been returned to such member and the refund of contributions to\nwhich he shall then be entitled shall be the net amount of such contributions\ntogether with interest thereon.
