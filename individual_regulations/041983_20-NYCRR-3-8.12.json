  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-8.12 - Subsequent changes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any\nchange in the amount of a corporation's UNOL must be made by the corporation or\nthe department within the statute of limitations referenced in section 1083(a), determined with regard to an extension of such time period agreed to pursuant\nto section 1083(c)(2) and the extension of such time period allowed by section\n1083(c)(12), for the report on which a PNOLC subtraction as computed in section\n3-8.7\nof this Subpart is first\nclaimed by the corporation. Any Federal changes that are finalized after the\nstatute of limitations described in the preceding sentence has expired will not\nbe considered in the computation of the UNOL. (b) Any change in the base year tax rate or\nbase year BAP must be made within the statute of limitations referenced in\nsection 1083(a) for the base year, determined with regard to an extension of\nsuch time period agreed to pursuant to section 1083(c)(2) and the extension of\nsuch time period allowed by section 1083(c)(12). Any Federal changes that are\nfinalized after the statute of limitations described in the preceding sentence\nhas expired will not be considered in the computation of the base year tax rate\nor base year BAP. (c) Except as\notherwise provided in this section, if it is determined by either the\ndepartment or the corporation that an error was made in the calculation or\napplication of the UNOL or the PNOLC subtraction in a tax year or tax years for\nwhich the statute of limitations referenced in section 1083(a), as determined\nwith regard to an extension of such time period agreed to pursuant to section\n1083(c)(2) and the extension of such time allowed by section 1083(c)(12), has\nexpired, the corporation and the department shall be bound by the position\ntaken by the corporation on the report or reports for such year or years as\nthey pertain to the calculation of the UNOL and the PNOLC subtraction, and the\nPNOLC subtraction and the unused PNOLC subtraction carryforward shall be\ncorrected for the taxable years for which the statute of limitations is still\nopen and for future taxable years. In the first year in which such correction\nmay be made, the amount of recomputed PNOLC subtraction pool shall be reduced\nby the amount of PNOLC subtraction that was used erroneously in the tax year or\ntax years for which the statute of limitations has expired. A new PNOLC\nsubtraction allotment must be computed for the remaining years of the\ncorporation's allotment method using the re-computed PNOLC subtraction pool, and any unused PNOLC subtraction carryforward from the tax year or tax years\nfor which the statute of limitations has expired is disallowed. (d) Examples. Example 1: Taxpayer A files its 2014 report using a BAP\nof 15%. However, on its 2015 report, it computes its PNOLC subtraction using a\nbase year BAP of 100%. Taxpayer A had a UNOL of $1,500,000 and a base year tax\nrate of 7.1%. It computed a PNOLC subtraction pool of $1,638, 461 and used the\n10% allotment method in the determination of its PNOLC subtraction. In 2015, Taxpayer A had a PNOLC subtraction of $100,000\nand claimed a PNOLC subtraction carryforward of $63,846 (10% allotment of\n$163,846 - $100,000). The department does not audit Taxpayer A's 2014 and 2015\nreports and does not discover the discrepancy in the 2014 reported BAP and the\nbase year BAP used in the PNOLC subtraction pool computation until it audits\n\nTaxpayer A's 2016 report in 2019, after the statute of limitations for the 2014\nand 2015 tax years has expired. Taxpayer A is bound by the BAP it used on its\n2014 report when computing the PNOLC subtraction pool. Thus, as part of the\naudit of the 2016 report, the department properly recomputes Taxpayer A's PNOLC\nsubtraction pool using the 15% BAP Taxpayer claimed on its 2014 report. Accordingly, Taxpayer A's PNOLC subtraction pool should have been $245,769\n($1,500,000 x.15 x.071/.065). The re-computed PNOLC subtraction pool is\nreduced by the $100,000 used in 2015 to determine the remaining PNOLC\nsubtraction pool of $145,769. Since Taxpayer A used the 10% allotment method\nand there are 9 remaining years of allotments to determine, the remaining PNOLC\nsubtraction pool is divided by 9. The PNOLC subtraction allotment for 2016 and\nthe next 8 tax years is $16,197. The PNOLC subtraction carryforward of $63,846\nreported on its 2015 return is disallowed. As a result, Taxpayer A has a PNOLC\nsubtraction available for use of $16,197 in the 2016 taxable year. Example 2: On its 2014 report, Taxpayer B claims to be a\nqualified manufacturer and used a 0% tax rate for its entire net income base. However, on its 2015 report, it computed a PNOLC subtraction using a base year\ntax rate of 7.1% and the 10% allotment method. The department does not audit\n\nTaxpayer B's 2014 and 2015 reports and does not discover the discrepancy in the\n2014 reported tax rate and the base year tax rate used in the PNOLC subtraction\npool computation until it audits Taxpayer B's 2016 report in 2019, after the\nstatute of limitations for the 2014 and 2015 tax years has expired. Taxpayer B\nis bound by the tax rate it used on its 2014 report and, as part of the 2016\naudit, the department properly recomputes a PNOLC subtraction pool of $0 and\ndenies the PNOLC subtraction in 2016. Taxpayer B is not entitled to use any\nPNOLC subtraction in future years. Example 3: Same facts as Example 2, except that Taxpayer\nB is a small business taxpayer as defined in section\n3-8.1\n(e)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart and Taxpayer B used 100% of its PNOLC subtraction pool on its 2015\nreport. Because the statute of limitations for the 2015 tax year has expired, the department is bound by the taxpayer's actions in 2015 and cannot recoup the\nPNOLC subtraction the taxpayer used in 2015.
