  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-4.1 - Acquisition by private purchase\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The procedure for acquiring land requires the prior written approval of the\noption or contract for the purchase of each parcel or for the purchase of each\ninterest therein and of the consideration to be paid therefor. Such approval\nwill ordinarily be endorsed by the division on the signature sheet of the\noption or contract prior to the execution thereof by the local\nagency. (b) Commitments for the\nacquisition of land by private purchase will not be reflected in the accounts\nuntil the accounts payable voucher authorizing the drawing of a check is\nprepared. Such commitments will automatically be reflected in column 8, estimated future commitments, of form DH-213, the Analysis of\n\nExpenditures--Budget Control Statement. Accounts payable vouchers representing\ncosts of land acquired by private purchase which are chargeable to account\n1440.1, Land Purchase Price, shall be supported by a closing statement prepared\non the Real Estate Settlement Record, form DH-349, (see Exhibit 9 of Appendix\nS-11), the attorney's certificate of title and the letter of the division\ntransmitting the approved option or contract. The approved option or contract\nshall be kept in a separate file. One accounts payable voucher may be prepared\nfor the total purchase price of each parcel of land, or for several parcels\nunder one option or contract and as many checks as may be required to liquidate\nthe items constituting the distribution of the purchase price, as for owner's\nequities, mortgages, taxes, etc. may be drawn and appropriately recorded on the\naccounts payable voucher. (c) In\nthe event that the local agency acquires a mortgage on a parcel prior to\nacquiring the owner's equity, it is recommended that the consideration for the\nmortgage be charged, temporarily, to a mortgages receivable account, using one\nof the numbers in the 1120 group of accounts not otherwise assigned. The\nmortgages receivable account should be supported by a subsidiary ledger. Such\nmortgages are held alive until the mortgages are merged into the fee and the\nuse of the mortgages receivable account and subsidiary ledger will more readily\npermit control over the billing of interest and amortization to the owners of\nthe equities. When the owner's equity is subsequently acquired and the mortgage\nmerged into the fee, the consideration for the mortgage, less any amortization\nreceived in the meanwhile, is transferred by journal voucher, to account\n1440.1, Land Purchase Price. Interest on such mortgage held alive shall be\ncredited to account 1420.2, Interest Income. (d) Under certain circumstances, all or part\nof a cost chargeable to account 1440.1, Land Purchase Price, may be deposited\nby the local agency in escrow. Such disbursements shall be charged to account\n1115, Special Deposits, pending the release of the money from escrow. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1646-4.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
