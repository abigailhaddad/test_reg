  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 300.5 - Planning standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Space\nrequirements. Plans for all buildings and related facilities shall be developed\nfrom space requirements prepared by State University. The space requirements\nwill list all of the required spaces to be included in the building or facility\ntogether with the required area and occupancy and description of use of each\nspace. Information shall also be included concerning the functional\ninterrelationship of spaces and as to expected future development and\nexpansion. Any special requirements for related grounds improvements and\nservices or utilities will also be included. The design or layout and\ndevelopment of plans shall be in substantial conformance with the space\nrequirements. (b) Site planning. (1)\n\nSite planning by the State University\nshall consider existing and proposed facilities and services, natural\ntopography, foundation conditions, future additions and economical\nmaintenance. (2)\n\nThe relative\nadvantages and economics of possible alternatives shall be\nconsidered. (c) Architectural concept. In accordance with subdivision 5 of section 376 of\narticle 8-A of the State Education Law, the architectural concept of facilities\nto be constructed shall be approved by the State University. The architectural\nconcept of a project shall take into consideration the relation of the project\nto the developed site, the schematic solution of the space requirements, economic feasibility and general architectural character. An acceptable concept\nshall relate to the general character of existing buildings, not necessarily by\ncopying them, but by being in harmony with them. (d) Design study. (1)\n\nThe State University Construction Fund\nshall cause to be prepared design studies for each new State University\nproject. These studies shall consist of architectural solutions of the\nrequirements evidencing the relationship of the project to existing buildings, facilities and site conditions with related cost calculations. (2)\nA design study consists of the following: (i) a graphic analysis of the program and/or\nspace requirements showing the relationship of the units and/or groups to each\nother; (ii)\nschematic drawings of\nfloor plans showing the actual and required net areas for each space, small\nscale elevations, longitudinal sections through the building or buildings\nindicating floor heights and relationship to existing and proposed\ngrades; (iii)\na location drawing\nshowing the relation of the proposed new facilities to existing buildings, future buildings, topography, roads, walks, parking space and athletic fields. Programmed stages of development shall be included where necessary; (iv)\na schedule graphically showing the time\nrequired to plan and construct the project; (v) scale models, renderings, and special\nreports when specifically requested by State University or required by the\n\nConstruction Fund. (e) Economic study. (1)\n\nThe State University Construction Fund\nshall cause to be prepared economic studies for each new State University\nproject. These studies shall be related to, and developed in conjunction with\nthe design studies. (2)\n\nAn economic\nstudy consists of the following: (i) total\ncosts analysis including unit cost calculations for buildings, site\ndevelopment, and utility work; (ii)\nunit cost calculations for all building projects. These shall be made by\npreparing a square foot and cubage analysis using a standard adopted by the\n\nConstruction Fund. In addition, unit costs for dormitories and dining halls\nshall be computed on a per bed or per seat basis; (iii)\na net to gross factor for each building\ncomputed as a basis for measuring the efficiency of a plan. For dormitories an\nequally important factor to be determined is the gross square feet per bed and\nfor dining halls the gross square feet per dining room seat. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8\n§\n300.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
