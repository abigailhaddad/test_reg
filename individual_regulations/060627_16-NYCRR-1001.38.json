  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.38 - Exhibit 38: water interconnection\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf a water interconnection is proposed for the facility, Exhibit 38 shall contain: (a) An\nestimate of the hourly and daily peak, and the hourly and daily average water\nsupply needs and consumptive water losses of the facility, in gallons, for each\nday of a typical year, broken down by power production and domestic uses, with\ndaily, monthly and annual totals. (b) An estimate of the daily peak, daily\naverage, and fire suppression peak and average flow rate needs of the facility\nin gallons per minute and a demonstration that an adequate water supply is\navailable (both quantity and pressure) for fire protection during both normal\nand drought periods. (c) A\ndescription of the methodology used (i.e., estimate, comparison, data, calculation) to prepare the water supply needs and minimum and maximum flow\nrate estimates stating all factors used. (d) A description of the water chemistry\nrequirements for water to be supplied to the facility, indicating any\nrequirements that are more stringent than New York State standards for potable\nwater, and describing any additional water treatment that shall be necessary to\nobtain the desired chemistry. (e) An identification of the public water supply source or sources, including an\nidentification of the well field(s) in the localized zone, proposed to be used\nby the facility, including: (1)\nstudies to\nassess the available capacity of the water supply source and an analysis of the\nimpacts, in terms of quantity, quality, and pressure during both normal and\ndrought periods of the facility's water use on the water supply system, including an identification of the well field(s) in the localized\nzone; (2)\nan identification of all\ninfrastructure requirements necessary to serve the facility including treatment\nrequirements; (3)\nthe impact of the\nfacility on excess infrastructure capacity, including distribution piping, mains, pumps, storage, or additional supply during both normal and maximum\nsystem demands; (4)\nif use of\nsurface water or an on-site well is proposed for water supply for the facility, a qualitative analysis of the water balance and an assessment of the impacts of\nthe removal of the maximum daily withdrawal for the facility, particularly\nduring drought periods, on stream flows and the ecological balance of\nwaterbodies, including hydrogeological studies to clearly demonstrate the\neffect of this withdrawal on any contaminant plumes that have the potential to\nbe influenced by the proposed well. These studies must state all methods used\nto promote that this withdrawal will not adversely affect any public or private\nwells; (5)\nif new surface water\nwithdrawal is proposed for water supply for the facility, an identification and\ndescription of any water treatment facilities and intake structures including a\ndemonstration that each facility represents best technology available, if\napplicable; and\n(6)\nan\nidentification and description of any facility water treatment\nfacilities. (f) A\ndetailed description of the proposed water interconnection, including all\ninterconnecting facilities, line route, size, functions, design details, and\noperating characteristics. (g) A\ndescription of the status of negotiations, and a copy of agreements that have\nbeen executed, with municipalities, public authorities, companies or\nindividuals for providing water to the facility, including permitting\nimplications/modification requirements and restrictions, if any, imposed by the\nprovider, and a preliminary description of how the interconnection and any\nnecessary system upgrades are to be installed, owned, maintained and\nfunded. (h) An identification and\nevaluation of other reasonable water supply alternatives and mitigation\nmeasures to avoid or minimize water supply impacts, including a contingency\nplan, if required, for water use curtailment during times of drought or water\nemergency, describing thresholds for water use curtailment. (i) A description and evaluation of\ncompliance with any requirements regarding water withdrawals contained in\napplicable State regulations, the great lakes compact, or any requirements of\nthe Susquehanna and Delaware River Basin Commissions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n1001.38\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
