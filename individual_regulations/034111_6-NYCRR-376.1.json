  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 376.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Purpose, scope and applicability. (1)\n\nThis Part identifies hazardous wastes\nthat are restricted from land disposal and defines those limited circumstances\nunder which an otherwise prohibited waste may be land disposed. (2)\n\nExcept as specifically provided otherwise\nin this Part or Part 371 of this Title, the requirements of this Part apply to\npersons who generate or transport hazardous waste and owners and operators of\nhazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities. (3)\n\nRestricted wastes may continue to be land\ndisposed as follows: (i) where persons have\nbeen granted an extension to the effective date of a prohibition under section\n376.3\nof this Part or pursuant to\n40 CFR\nsection\n268.5\nand subdivision (e) of this\nsection with respect to those wastes covered by the extension; (ii)\nwhere persons have been granted an\nexemption from a prohibition pursuant to a petition under\n40\nCFR section\n268.6\nand subdivision (f) of this\nsection with respect to those wastes and units covered by the\npetition; (iii)\nwastes that are\nhazardous only because they exhibit a hazardous characteristic, and which are\notherwise prohibited under this Part, 40 CFR part\n148, or titles 7 and 8 of\narticle 17 of the ECL, are not prohibited if the wastes: (a) are disposed into a nonhazardous or\nhazardous injection well as defined under\n40 CFR\n144.6(a)\nand regulated under\nECL titles 7 and 8; and\n(b) do not\nexhibit any prohibited characteristic of hazardous waste identified in section\n371.3\nof this Title at the point of\ninjection; (iv)\nwastes\nthat are hazardous only because they exhibit a hazardous characteristic, and\nwhich are otherwise prohibited under this Part, are not prohibited if the\nwastes meet any of the following criteria, unless the wastes are subject to a\nspecified method of treatment other than DEACT in section\n376.4\nof this Part, or are D003\nreactive cyanide: (a) the wastes are managed\nin a treatment system which subsequently discharges to a water of New York\n\nState pursuant to a SPDES permit issued under titles 7 and 8 or the Clean Water\n\nAct; or\n(b) the wastes are treated\nfor purposes of the pretreatment requirements of section 307 of the Clean Water\n\nAct; or\n(c) the wastes are managed\nin a zero discharge system engaged in titles 7 and 8 or Clean Water\n\nAct-equivalent treatment as defined in section\n376.3\n(e)(1)\nof\nthis Part; and\n(d) the wastes no\nlonger exhibit a prohibited characteristic at the point of land disposal\n(\ni.e., placement in a surface\nimpoundment). (4)\n\nThe following hazardous wastes are not\nsubject to any provision of this Part: (i) waste generated by conditionally exempt small quantity generators of less than\n100 kilograms of nonacute hazardous waste or less than 1 kilogram of acute\nhazardous waste per calendar month, as defined in section\n371.1\n(f) of this\n\nTitle; (ii)\nwaste pesticides that a\nfarmer disposes of pursuant to section\n372.1\n(e)(3) (i), (ii), (iii) and\n(iv)\nof this Title; and\n(iii)\nwastes identified or listed as\nhazardous after November 8, 1984 for which DEC has not promulgated land\ndisposal prohibitions or treatment standards. (5)\n\nThe commissioner may authorize an\nexemption, extension, or variance from any provision of this Part, so long as\nsuch action will not result in requirements that are less broad or less\nstringent than the requirements of 40 CFR part\n268\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). If an exemption, extension, or variance from the land disposal\nprovisions of 40 CFR part\n268\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) has been granted by the EPA administrator pursuant to\n40 CFR\nsection\n268.5, 268.6, 268.42(b)\nor\n268.44, the commissioner must, if such action is to become effective in New York State, subsequently also approve such action, but the commissioner shall not grant\napproval in any way as to make such action broader in scope, longer in\nduration, or less stringent than authorized by the person of the obligation to\ncomply with all other applicable provisions of this Part. Applications for\nexemptions, extensions, or variances by any generator or facility shall be in\naccordance with the petition provisions of section\n373-1.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (6)\n\nSeverability. If any\nprovision of this Part or its application to any person or circumstances is\nheld invalid, the remainder of this Part, and the application of those\nprovisions to persons or circumstances, other than those to which it is held\ninvalid, shall not be affected thereby. (7)\n\nThe requirements of this Part shall not\naffect the availability of a waiver under section 121(d) (4) of the\n\nComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980\n(CERCLA). (8)\n\nDe\nminimis\nlosses of characteristic wastes to wastewaters are not\nconsidered to be prohibited wastes and are defined as losses from normal\nmaterial handling operations (\ne.g., spills from the unloading\nor transfer of materials from bins or other containers, leaks from pipes, valves or other devices used to transfer materials); minor leaks of process\nequipment, storage tanks or containers; leaks from well-maintained pump\npackings and seals; sample purgings; and relief device discharges; discharges\nfrom safety showers and rinsing and cleaning of personal safety equipment; rinsate from empty containers or from containers that are rendered empty by\nthat rinsing; and laboratory wastes not exceeding one percent of the total flow\nof wastewater into the facility's headworks on an annual basis, or with a\ncombined annualized average concentration not exceeding one part per million in\nthe headworks of the facility's wastewater treatment or pretreatment\nfacility. (9)\n[\nReserved\n]\n(10)\n\nUniversal waste handlers and universal waste transporters (as defined in\nsection\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle) are exempt from subdivision (g) of this section and section\n376.5\nof this Part for the\nhazardous wastes listed below. Universal waste handlers and universal waste\ntransporters are subject to regulation under Subpart 374-3 of this Title. (i) batteries as described in section\n374-3.1\n(b) of this\n\nTitle; (ii)\npesticides as described\nin section\n374-3.1\n(c) of this\n\nTitle; (iii)\nmercury-containing\nequipment as described in section\n374-3.1\n(d) of this\n\nTitle; and\n(iv)\nlamps as described\nin section\n374-3.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (v) aerosol cans as\ndescribed in section\n374-3.1\n(f) of this\n\nTitle; and\n(vi)\npaint as described\nin section\n374-3.1\n(g) of this\n\nTitle. (b) Definitions applicable to this Part.

(ii)\n\nHazardous constituent\nor\nconstituents\nmeans\nthose constituents listed in Appendix 23 of this Title. (iii)\n\nLand disposal\nmeans\nplacement in or on the land, except in a corrective action management unit or\nstaging pile, and includes, but is not limited to, placement in a landfill, surface impoundment, waste pile, land treatment facility, salt dome formation, salt bed formation, underground mine or cave, injection well, or placement in a\nconcrete vault or bunker intended for disposal purposes. (iv)\n\nNonwastewaters\nare\nwastes that do not meet the criteria for wastewaters in subparagraph (1)(vi) of\nthis subdivision. (v) Polychlorinated biphenyls\nor\nPCBs\nare\nhalogenated organic compounds defined in accordance with section\n371.4\n(e) of this\n\nTitle and\n40\nCFR\n761.3. (vi)\n\nWastewaters\nare wastes\nthat contain less than one percent by weight total organic carbon (TOC) and\nless than one percent by weight total suspended solids (TSS). (vii)\n\nDebris\nmeans solid\nmaterial exceeding a 60 mm particle size that is intended for disposal and that\nis: a manufactured object; or plant or animal matter; or natural geologic\nmaterial. However, the following materials are not debris: any material for\nwhich a specific treatment standard is provided in section\n376.4\nof this Part, namely lead\nacid batteries, cadmium batteries and radioactive lead solids; process\nresiduals such as smelter slag and residues from the treatment of waste, wastewater, sludges, or air emission residues; and intact containers of\nhazardous waste that are not ruptured and that retain at least 75 percent of\ntheir original volume. A mixture of debris that has not been treated to the\nstandards provided by section\n376.4\n(g) of this\n\nPart and other material is subject to regulation as debris if the mixture is\ncomprised primarily of debris, by volume, based on visual inspection. (viii)\n\nHazardous debris\nmeans debris that contains a hazardous waste listed in section\n371.4\nof this Title, or that\nexhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste identified in section\n371.3\nof this Title. Any deliberate\nmixing of prohibited hazardous waste with debris that changes its treatment\nclassification (\ni.e., from waste to hazardous debris) is not\nallowed under the dilution prohibition in subdivision (c) of this\nsection. (ix)\n\nRestricted\nwastes\nare hazardous wastes that are prohibited from land disposal by\neither statute or regulation, regardless of whether subcategories of such\nwastes are subject to an exemption, extension, or variance. (x) Tolling agreements\nare\ncontractual agreements as defined in section\n372.2\n(b)(7)(i), (ii) and\n(iii)\nof this Title. (xi)\n\nSpalling, as used in\nsection\n376.4\n(g) of this\n\nTitle, means the removal of, but is not limited to, chips, fragments, slabs, pieces, or layers of debris from hazardous debris. (xii)\n\nUnderlying hazardous\nconstituent\nmeans any constituent listed in section\n376.4\n(j) of this\n\nPart, Table UTS - Universal Treatment Standards, except fluoride, selenium, sulfides, vanadium and zinc, which can reasonably be expected to be present at\nthe point of generation of the hazardous waste, at a concentration above the\nconstituent-specific UTS treatment standards. (xiii)\n\nInorganic metal-bearing\nwaste\nis one for which the department has established treatment\nstandards for metal hazardous constituents, and which does not otherwise\ncontain significant organic or cyanide content as described in subparagraph\n(c)(3)(i) of this section, and is specifically listed in Appendix 54 of this\n\nTitle. (xiv)\n\nSoil\nmeans unconsolidated earth material composing the superficial geologic strata\n(material overlying bedrock), consisting of clay, silt, sand, or gravel size\nparticles as classified by the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, or\na mixture of such materials with liquids, sludges or solids which is\ninseparable by simple mechanical removal processes and is made up primarily of\nsoil by volume based on visual inspection. Any deliberate mixing of prohibited\nhazardous waste with soil that changes its treatment classification\n(\ni.e., from waste to contaminated soil) is not allowed under\nthe dilution prohibition in subdivision (c) of this section. (2)\n\nAll other terms have the\nmeanings given under sections\n370.2\n(b), 371.1\n(a), (c) and\n(d) of this Title. (c) Dilution prohibited as a substitute\nfor treatment. (1)\n\nExcept as provided\nin paragraph (2) of this subdivision, no generator, transporter, handler, owner\nor operator of a treatment, storage, or disposal facility shall in any way\ndilute a restricted waste or the residual from treatment of a restricted waste\nas a substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with section\n376.4\nof this Part, to circumvent\nthe effective date of a prohibition in section\n376.3\nof this Part, to otherwise\navoid a prohibition in section\n376.3\nof this Part, or to\ncircumvent a land disposal prohibition imposed by titles 1, 7 and 9 of article\n27 of the Environmental Conservation Law. (2)\n\nDilution of wastes that are hazardous\nonly because they exhibit a characteristic in treatment systems which include\nland-based units which treat wastes subsequently discharged to a water of New\n\nYork State, pursuant to a SPDES permit issued under titles 7 and 8 of article\n17 of the Environmental Conservation Law, or which treat wastes in a CWA -\nequivalent treatment system, or which treat waste for the purposes of\npretreatment requirements under section 307 of the Clean Water Act is not\nimpermissible dilution for purposes of this subdivision unless a method other\nthan DEACT has been specified in section\n376.4\n(a) of this\n\nPart as the treatment standard, or unless the waste is a D003 reactive cyanide\nwastewater or nonwastewater. (3)\n\nCombustion of the hazardous waste codes listed in Appendix 54 of this Title is\nprohibited, unless the waste, at the point of generation, or after any bona\nfide treatment such as cyanide destruction prior to combustion, can be\ndemonstrated to comply with one or more of the following criteria (unless\notherwise specifically prohibited from combustion): (i) the waste contains hazardous organic\nconstituents or cyanide at levels exceeding the constituent-specific treatment\nstandard found in section\n376.4\n(j) of this\n\nPart; (ii)\nthe waste consists of\norganic, debris-like materials (\ne.g., wood, paper, plastic, or\ncloth) contaminated with an inorganic metal -bearing hazardous waste; (iii)\nthe waste, at point of generation, has\nreasonable heating value such as greater than or equal to 5000 BTU per\npound; (iv)\nthe waste is\ncogenerated with wastes for which combustion is a required method of\ntreatment; (v) the waste is subject\nto Federal and/or State requirements necessitating reduction of organics\n(including biological agents); or\n(vi)\nthe waste contains greater than one\npercent total organic carbon (TOC). (4)\n\nIt is a form of impermissible dilution, and therefore prohibited, to add iron filings or other metallic forms of iron\nto lead-containing hazardous wastes in order to achieve any land disposal\nrestriction treatment standard for lead. Lead-containing wastes include D008\nwastes (wastes exhibiting a characteristic due to the presence of lead), all\ncharacteristic wastes containing lead as an underlying hazardous constituent, listed wastes containing lead as a regulated constituent, and hazardous media\ncontaining any of the aforementioned lead-containing\nwastes. (d) Treatment surface impoundment exemption. (1)\n\nWastes which are otherwise prohibited\nfrom land disposal under this Part may be treated in a surface impoundment or\nseries of impoundments provided that: (i) Treatment of such wastes occurs in the impoundments; and\n(ii)\n\nThe following conditions are met: (a) Sampling and testing. For wastes with\ntreatment standards in section\n376.4\nof this Part and/or\nprohibition levels in section\n376.3\nof this Part, or RCRA section\n3004(d), the residues from treatment are analyzed, as specified in subdivision\n(g) of this section or section\n376.3\n(b) of this\n\nPart to determine if they meet the applicable treatment standards or, where no\ntreatment standards have been established for the waste, the applicable\nprohibition levels. The sampling method, specified in the waste analysis plan\nunder section\n373-2.2\n(e) or\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nTitle, must be designed such that representative samples of the sludge and the\nsupernatant are tested separately rather than mixed to form homogeneous\nsamples. (b) Removal. The following\ntreatment residues (including any liquid waste) must be removed at least\nannually; residues which do not meet the treatment standards promulgated under\nsection\n376.4\nof this Part; residues which\ndo not meet the prohibition levels established under section\n376.3\nof this Part or imposed by\nstatute (where no treatment standards have been established); residues which\nare from the treatment of wastes prohibited from land disposal under section\n376.3\nof this Part (where no\ntreatment standards have been established and no prohibition levels apply); or\nresidues from managing listed wastes which are not delisted under section\n370.3\n(c) of this\n\nTitle. If the volume of liquid flowing through the impoundment or series of\nimpoundments annually is greater than the volume of the impoundment or\nimpoundments, this flow-through constitutes removal of the supernatant for the\npurpose of this requirement. (c) Subsequent management. Treatment residues may not be placed in any other\nsurface impoundment for subsequent management. (d) Recordkeeping. Sampling and testing and\nrecordkeeping provisions of sections\n373-2.2\n(e) and\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nTitle apply. (iii)\n\nThe\nimpoundment meets the design requirements of section\n373-2.11\n(b)(3)\nor\n373-3.11\n(i)(1)\nof\nthis Title, regardless that the unit may not be new, expanded, or a\nreplacement, and be in compliance with applicable ground water monitoring\nrequirements of sections 373-2.6 and\n373-3.6\nof this Title unless: (a) it is exempted pursuant to section\n373-2.11\n(b)(4) or\n(5), or section\n373-3.11\n(i)(3) or\n(4)\nof this Title; or\n(b) upon application by the owner or\noperator, the commissioner, after notice and an opportunity to comment, has\ngranted a waiver of the requirements on the basis that the surface impoundment: (1)\nhas at least one liner, for which there\nis no evidence that such liner is leaking; (2)\nis located more than one-quarter mile\nfrom an underground source of drinking water; and\n(3)\nis in compliance with generally\napplicable ground water monitoring requirements for facilities with permits; or\n(c) upon application by\nthe owner or operator, the commissioner, after notice and an opportunity to\ncomment, has granted a modification to the requirements on the basis of a\ndemonstration that the surface impoundment is located, designed, and operated\nso as to assure that there will be no migration of any hazardous constituent\ninto ground water or surface water at any future time. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator submits to the\ncommissioner a written certification that the requirements of subparagraph\n(iii) of this paragraph have been met. The following certification is required: I certify under penalty of law that the requirements of 6\nNYCRR\n376.1\n(d)(1)(iii) have been met for all surface impoundments being used to\ntreat restricted wastes. I believe that the submitted information is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for\nsubmitting false information, including the possibility of fine and\nimprisonment. (e) Procedures for case-by-case\nextensions to an effective date. (1)\n\nAny person who generates, treats, stores, or disposes of a hazardous waste may\nsubmit an application to the EPA administrator pursuant to\n40 CFR\nsection\n268.5, and to the commissioner for an\nextension to the effective date of any applicable restriction established under\nsection\n376.3\nof this Part. Before any\nextension can take effect, the EPA administrator must also have approved the\napplication pursuant to\n40 CFR\nsection\n268.5. The applicant must demonstrate\nthe following: (i) they have made a\ngood-faith effort to locate and contract with treatment, recovery, or disposal\nfacilities nationwide to manage their waste in accordance with the effective\ndate of the applicable restriction established under section\n376.3\nof this Part; (ii)\nthey have entered into a binding\ncontractual commitment to construct or otherwise provide alternative treatment, recovery (\ne.g., recycling), or disposal capacity that meets\nthe treatment standards specified in section\n376.4\nof this Part or, where\ntreatment standards have not been specified, such treatment, recovery, or\ndisposal capacity is protective of human health and the environment; (iii)\ndue to circumstances beyond the\napplicant's control, such alternative capacity cannot reasonably be made\navailable by the applicable effective date. This demonstration may include a\nshowing that the technical and practical difficulties associated with providing\nthe alternative capacity will result in the capacity not being available by the\napplicable effective date; (iv)\nthe\ncapacity being constructed or otherwise provided by the applicant will be\nsufficient to manage the entire quantity of waste that is the subject of the\napplication; (v) they have prepared\na detailed schedule for obtaining required operating and construction permits\nor an outline of how and when alternative capacity will be available; (vi)\nthey have arranged for adequate capacity\nto manage their waste during an extension and has documented in the application\nthe location of all sites at which the waste will be managed; and\n(v) any waste managed in a surface\nimpoundment or landfill during the extension period will meet the requirements\nof subparagraph (8)(ii) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nAn authorized representative signing an\napplication described under paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall make the\nfollowing certification: I certify under penalty of law that I have personally\nexamined and am familiar with the information submitted in this document and\nall attachments and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals immediately\nresponsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the information is\ntrue, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties\nfor submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and\nimprisonment. (3)\n\nAfter\nreceiving an application for an extension, the commissioner may request any\nadditional information which is deemed necessary to evaluate the\napplication. (4)\n\nAn extension will\napply only to the waste generated at the individual facility covered by the\napplication and will not apply to restricted waste from any other\nfacility. (5)\n\nOn the basis of the\ninformation referred to in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, after notice and\nopportunity for comment, the commissioner may grant an extension of up to one\nyear from the effective date. The commissioner may renew this extension for up\nto one additional year upon the request of the applicant if the demonstration\nrequired in paragraph (1) of this subdivision can still be made. In no event\nwill an extension extend beyond 24 months from the applicable effective date\nspecified in section\n376.3\nof this Part. The length of\nany extension authorized will be determined by the commissioner based on the\ntime required to construct or obtain the type of capacity needed by the\napplicant as described in the completion schedule discussed in subparagraph\n(1)(v) of this subdivision. The commissioner will give public notice of the\nintent to approve or deny a petition and provide an opportunity for public\ncomment. The final decision on a petition will be published in the New York\n\nState Register. (6)\n\nAny person granted an extension under\nthis subdivision must immediately notify the commissioner as soon as that\nperson has knowledge of any change in the conditions certified to in the\napplication. (7)\n\nAny person granted\nan extension under this subdivision shall submit written progress reports at\nintervals designated by the commissioner. Such reports must describe the\noverall progress made toward constructing or otherwise providing alternative\ntreatment, recovery or disposal capacity; must identify any event which may\ncause or has caused a delay in the development of the capacity; and must\nsummarize the steps taken to mitigate the delay. The commissioner can revoke\nthe extension at any time if the applicant does not demonstrate a good-faith\neffort to meet the schedule for completion, if the DEC denies or revokes any\nrequired permit, if conditions certified in the application change, or for any\nviolation of this Title. (8)\n\nWhenever the commissioner establishes an extension to an effective date under\nthis subdivision, during the period for which such extension is in effect: (i) the storage restrictions under section\n376.5\nof this Part do not apply; and\n(ii)\nsuch hazardous waste may\nbe disposed in a landfill or surface impoundment only if such unit is in\ncompliance with the technical requirements of the following provisions\nregardless of whether such unit is existing, new, or a replacement or lateral\nexpansion. (a) the landfill, if in interim\nstatus, is in compliance with the requirements of sections\n373-3.6\nand\n373-3.14\n(j)(1), (3) and\n(4)\nof this Title; or\n(b) the landfill, if permitted, is in\ncompliance with the requirements of sections 373-2.6 and\n373-2.14\n(c)(3), (4) and\n(5)\nof this Title; (c) the surface impoundment, if in interim\nstatus, is in compliance with the requirements of sections\n373-3.6\nand\n373-3.11\n(i)(1), (3) and\n(4)\nof this Title; or\n(d) the surface impoundment, if permitted, is\nin compliance with the requirements of sections 373-2.6 and\n373-2.11\n(b)(3), (4) and\n(5)\nof this Title; or\n(e) the surface impoundment, if newly subject\nto section\n373-2.11\n(b)(3), (4), and (5) due to the promulgation of\nadditional listings or characteristics for the identification of hazardous\nwaste, is in compliance with the requirements of section\n373-2.6\nof this Title within 12\nmonths after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of\nhazardous waste, and with the requirements of section\n373-2.11\n(b)(3), (4) and\n(5)\nof this Title within 48 months after the\npromulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste. If a\nnational capacity variance is granted, pursuant to paragraph (a)(5) of this\nsection, during the period the variance is in effect, the surface impoundment, if newly subject to section\n373-2.11\n(b)(3), (4) and\n(5)\ndue to the promulgation of additional\nlistings or characteristics of hazardous waste, is in compliance with the\nrequirements of section\n373-2.6\nof this Title within 12\nmonths after the promulgation of additional listings or characteristics of\nhazardous waste, and with the requirements of section\n373-2.11\n(b)(3), (4) and\n(5)\nof this Title within 48 months after the\npromulgation of additional listings or characteristics of hazardous waste; and\n(f) for the purpose of\nimplementing clause (\ne\n) of this subparagraph, 12 and 48 month\nperiods specified will run concurrently with EPA established schedules, from\nthe date of the initial promulgation of listings or characteristics by the EPA, as well as national capacity variances, pursuant to this Part and 40 CFR part\n268\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). (9)\n\nPending a decision on the application the applicant is required to comply with\nall restrictions on land disposal under this Part once the effective date for\nthe waste has been reached. (f) Petitions to allow land disposal of\na waste prohibited under section\n376.3\nof this Part. (1)\n\nAny person seeking an exemption from a\nprohibition under section\n376.3\nof this Part for the disposal\nof a restricted hazardous waste in a particular unit or units must submit a\npetition to the EPA administrator pursuant to\n40\nCFR section\n268.6\nand the commissioner\ndemonstrating, to a reasonable degree of certainty, that there will be no\nmigration of hazardous constituents from the disposal unit for as long as the\nwastes remain hazardous. Before any extension can take effect, the EPA\nadministrator must also have approved the application pursuant to\n40\nCFR section\n268.6. The demonstration must\ninclude the following components: (i) an\nidentification of the specific waste and the specific unit for which the\ndemonstration will be made; (ii)\na\nwaste analysis to describe fully the chemical and physical characteristics of\nthe subject waste; (iii)\na\ncomprehensive characterization of the disposal unit site including an analysis\nof background air, soil, and water quality; (iv)\na monitoring plan that detects migration\nat the earliest practicable time; and\n(v) sufficient information to assure the\ncommissioner that the owner or operator of a land disposal unit receiving\nrestricted waste(s) will comply with other applicable Federal and State\nlaws. (2)\n\nThe\ndemonstration referred to in paragraph (1) of this subdivision must meet the\nfollowing criteria: (i) all waste and\nenvironmental sampling, test, and analysis data must be accurate and\nreproducible to the extent that state-of-the-art techniques allow; (ii)\nall sampling, testing, and estimation\ntechniques for chemical and physical properties of the waste and all\nenvironmental parameters must have been approved by the commissioner; (iii)\nsimulation models must be calibrated\nfor the specific wastes and site conditions, and verified for accuracy by\ncomparison with actual measurements; (iv)\na quality assurance and quality control\nplan that addresses all aspects of the demonstration must be approved by the\ncommissioner; and\n(v) an analysis\nmust be performed to identify and quantify any aspects of the demonstration\nthat contribute significantly to uncertainty. This analysis must include an\nevaluation of the consequences of predictable future events, including, but not\nlimited to, earthquakes, floods, severe storm events, droughts, or other\nnatural phenomena. (3)\n\nEach petition referred to in paragraph (1) of this subdivision must include the\nfollowing: (i) a monitoring plan that\ndescribes the monitoring program installed at and/or around the unit to verify\ncontinued compliance with the conditions of the exemption. This monitoring plan\nmust provide information on the monitoring of the unit and/or the environment\naround the unit. The following specific information must be included in the\nplan: (a) the media monitored in the cases\nwhere monitoring of the environment around the unit is required; (b) the type of monitoring conducted at the\nunit, in the cases where monitoring of the unit is required; (c) the location of the monitoring\nstations; (d) the monitoring\ninterval (frequency of monitoring at each station); (e) the specific hazardous constituents to be\nmonitored; (f) the implementation\nschedule for the monitoring program; (g) the equipment used at the monitoring\nstations; (h) the sampling and\nanalytical techniques employed; and\n(i) the data recording/reporting\nprocedures; (ii)\nwhere\napplicable, the monitoring program described in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph must be in place for a period of time specified by the commissioner, as part of the approval of the petition, prior to receipt of prohibited waste\nat the unit; (iii)\nthe monitoring\ndata collected according to the monitoring plan specified under subparagraph\n(i) of this paragraph must be sent to the commissioner according to a format\nand schedule specified and approved in the monitoring plan; (iv)\na copy of the monitoring data collected\nunder the monitoring plan specified under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph\nmust be kept on-site at the facility in the operating record; (v) the monitoring program specified under\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph must meet the following criteria: (a) all sampling, testing, and analytical\ndata must be approved by the commissioner and must provide data that is\naccurate and reproducible; (b) all\nestimation and monitoring techniques must be approved by the commissioner; and\n(c) a quality assurance and\nquality control plan addressing all aspects of the monitoring program must be\nprovided to and approved by the commissioner. (4)\n\nEach petition must be submitted to the\ncommissioner. (5)\n\nAfter a petition\nhas been approved, the owner or operator must report any changes in conditions\nat the unit and/or the environment around the unit that significantly depart\nfrom the conditions described in the exemption and affect the potential for\nmigration of hazardous constituents from the units as follows: (i) If the owner or operator plans to make\nchanges to the unit design, construction, or operation, such a change must be\nproposed, in writing, and the owner or operator must submit a demonstration to\nthe commissioner at least 30 days prior to making the change. The commissioner\nwill determine whether the proposed change invalidates the terms of the\npetition and will determine the appropriate response. Any change must be\napproved by the commissioner prior to being made. (ii)\n\nIf the owner or operator discovers that\na condition at the site which was modeled or predicted in the petition does not\noccur as predicted, this change must be reported, in writing, to the\ncommissioner within 10 days of discovering the change. The commissioner will\ndetermine whether the reported change from the terms of the petition requires\nfurther action, which may include termination of waste acceptance and\nrevocation of the petition, petition modifications, or other\nresponses. (6)\n\nIf the\nowner or operator determines that there is migration of hazardous\nconstituent(s) from the unit, the owner or operator must: (i) immediately suspend receipt of prohibited\nwaste at the unit; (ii)\nnotify the\ncommissioner, in writing, within 10 days of the determination that a release\nhas occurred; and\n(iii)\nfollowing\nreceipt of the notification, the commissioner will determine within 60 days of\nreceiving notification, whether the owner or operator can continue to receive\nprohibited waste in the unit and whether the exemption is to be revoked. The\ncommissioner shall also determine whether further examination of any migration\nis warranted under applicable provisions of Subpart 373-2 or 373-3 of this\n\nTitle. (7)\n\nEach petition\nmust include the following statement signed by the petitioner or an authorized\nrepresentative: I certify under penalty of law that I have personally\nexamined and am familiar with the information submitted in this petition and\nall attached documents, and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals\nimmediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that submitted\ninformation is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are\nsignificant penalties for submitting false information, including the\npossibility of fine and imprisonment. (8)\n\nAfter receiving a petition, the\ncommissioner may request any additional information that reasonably may be\nrequired to evaluate the demonstration. (9)\n\nIf approved, the petition will apply to\nland disposal of the specific restricted waste at the individual disposal unit\ndescribed in the demonstration and will not apply to any other restricted waste\nat that disposal unit, or to that specific restricted waste at any other\ndisposal unit. (10)\n\nThe\ncommissioner will give public notice in the New York\n\nState\n\nRegister\nof the intent to approve or deny a petition and provide an\nopportunity for public comment. The final decision on a petition will be\npublished in the New York\n\nState Register. (11)\n\nThe term of a petition granted under\nthis section shall be no longer than the term of the Part 373 permit if the\ndisposal unit is operating under a Part 373 permit, or up to a maximum of 10\nyears from the date of approval provided under paragraph (7) of this\nsubdivision if the unit is operating under interim status. In either case, the\nterm of the granted petition shall expire upon the termination or denial of a\n\nPart 373 permit, or upon the termination of interim status or when the volume\nlimit of waste to be land disposed during the term of petition is\nreached. (12)\n\nPrior to the\ncommissioner's decision, the applicant is required to comply with all\nrestrictions on land disposal under this Part once the effective date for the\nwaste has been reached. (13)\n\nThe\npetition granted by the commissioner does not relieve petitioners of their\nresponsibilities in the management of hazardous waste under Parts 370 through\n376. (14)\n\nLiquid hazardous wastes\ncontaining polychlorinated biphenyls at concentrations greater than or equal to\n50 ppm are not eligible for an exemption under this\nsubdivision. (g) Testing, tracking, and recordkeeping requirements for generators, treaters, and disposal facilities. (1)\n\nRequirements for generators: (i) A generator\nof a hazardous waste must determine if the waste has to be treated before it\ncan be land disposed. This is done by determining if the hazardous waste meets\nthe treatment standards in section\n376.4\n(a), (f), (g) or\n(k) of this Part. This determination can be\nmade concurrently with the hazardous waste determination required in paragraph\n372.2(a)(2) of this Title in either of two ways: testing the waste or using\nknowledge of the waste. If the generator tests the waste, testing would\nnormally determine the total concentration of hazardous constituents, or the\nconcentration of hazardous constituents in an extract of the waste obtained\nusing Test Method 1311 in \"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" EPA Publication SW 846, as incorporated by\nreference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, depending on whether the treatment standard for the waste is expressed\nas a total concentration or concentration of hazardous constituent in the\nwaste's extract. (Alternatively, the generator must send the waste to a\nRCRA-permitted hazardous waste treatment facility, where the waste treatment\nfacility must comply with the requirements of 373-2.2[e] of this Title and\nparagraph [2] of this subdivision.) In addition, some hazardous wastes and some\nsoils that are contaminated by such hazardous wastes must be treated by\nparticular treatment methods before they can be land disposed. These treatment\nstandards are also found in section\n376.4\n(a) of this\n\nPart, and are described in detail in section\n376.4\n(c), Table 1\nof this Part. These wastes, and soils contaminated with such wastes, do not\nneed to be tested (however, if they are in a waste mixture, other wastes with\nconcentration level treatment standards would have to be tested). If a\ngenerator determines they are managing a waste or a soil contaminated with a\nwaste, that displays a hazardous characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, or toxicity, the generator must comply with the special\nrequirements of subdivision (h) of this section in addition to any applicable\nrequirements in this subdivision. (ii)\n\nIf the waste or contaminated soil does\nnot meet the treatment standards, or if the generator chooses not to make the\ndetermination of whether the generator's waste must be treated, with the\ninitial shipment of waste to each treatment or storage facility, the generator\nmust send a one time written notice to each treatment or storage facility\nreceiving the waste, and place a copy in the file. The notice must include the\ninformation in column \"section\n376.1\n(g)(1)(ii)\n\"\nof the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table in subparagraph (iv) of this\nparagraph. (Alternatively, if the generator chooses not to make the\ndetermination of whether the waste must be treated, the notification must\ninclude the EPA Hazardous Waste Numbers and Manifest Number of the first\nshipment and must state \"This hazardous waste may or may not be subject to the\nLDR treatment standards. The treatment facility must make the determination.\")\n\nNo further notification is necessary until such time that the waste or facility\nchange, in which case a new notification must be sent and a copy placed in the\ngenerator's file. (iii)\n\nIf the\nwaste or contaminated soil meets the treatment standard at the original point\nof generation: (a) with the initial shipment\nof waste to each treatment, storage, or disposal facility, the generator must\nsend a one-time written notice to each treatment, storage, or disposal facility\nreceiving the waste, and place a copy in the file. The notice must include the\ninformation indicated in column \"section\n376.1\n(g)(1)(iii)\n\"\nof the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table in subparagraph (iv) of this\nparagraph, and the following certification statement, signed by an authorized\nrepresentative: \"I certify under penalty of law that I personally have\nexamined and am familiar with the waste through analysis and testing or through\nknowledge of the waste to support this certification that the waste complies\nwith the treatment standards specified in 6 NYCRR section\n376.4. I believe that the\ninformation I submitted is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there\nare significant penalties for submitting a false certification, including the\npossibility of a fine and imprisonment.\"\n(b) for contaminated soil, with the initial\nshipment of wastes to each treatment, storage, or disposal facility, the\ngenerator must send a one-time written notice to each facility receiving the\nwaste and place a copy in the file. The notice must include the information in\ncolumn \"section\n376.1\n(g)(1)(iii)\n\"\nof the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table in subparagraph (iv) of this\nparagraph; and\n(c) if the waste\nchanges, the generator must send a new notice and certification to the\nreceiving facility, and place a copy in their files. Generators of hazardous\ndebris excluded from the definition of hazardous waste under section\n371.1\n(d)(5)\nof\nthis Title are not subject to these requirements. (iv)\n\nFor reporting, tracking and\nrecordkeeping when exceptions allow certain wastes or contaminated soil that do\nnot meet the treatment standards to be land disposed: there are certain\nexemptions from the requirement that hazardous wastes or contaminated soil meet\ntreatment standards before they can be land disposed. These include, but are\nnot limited to case-by-case extensions under subdivision (e) of this section, disposal in a no-migration unit under subdivision (f) of this section, or a\nnational capacity variance or case-by-case capacity variance under section\n376.3\nof this Part. If a\ngenerator's waste is so exempt, then with the initial shipment of waste, the\ngenerator must send a one-time written notice to each land disposal facility\nreceiving the waste. The notice must include the information indicated in\ncolumn \"section\n376.1\n(g)(1)(iv)\n\"\nof the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table below. If the waste changes, the\ngenerator must send a new notice to the receiving facility, and place a copy in\ntheir files.

(Generators treating hazardous debris under the alternative\ntreatment standards in Table 1, section\n376.4\n[g]\nof this\n\nPart, however, are not subject to these waste analysis requirements.) The plan\nmust be kept on site in the generator's records, and the following requirements\nmust be met: (a) The waste analysis plan must\nbe based on a detailed chemical and physical analysis of a representative\nsample of the prohibited waste(s) being treated, and contain all information\nnecessary to treat the waste(s) in accordance with the requirements of this\n\nPart, including the selected testing frequency. (b) Such plan must be kept in the facility's\non-site files and made available to inspectors. (c) Wastes shipped off-site pursuant to this\nparagraph must comply with the notification requirements of subparagraph (iii)\nof this paragraph. (vi)\n\nIf a generator determines that the waste or contaminated soil is restricted\nbased solely on generator knowledge of the waste, all supporting data used to\nmake this determination must be retained on-site in the generator's files. If a\ngenerator determines that the waste is restricted based on testing this waste\nor an extract developed using the test method 1311 in \"Test Methods for\n\nEvaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" EPA Publication SW-846, (as\nincorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle), and all waste analysis data must be retained on-site in the generator's\nfiles. (vii)\n\nIf a generator\ndetermines that the generator is managing a prohibited waste that is excluded\nfrom the definition of hazardous or solid waste or is exempted from hazardous\nwaste regulation, under section\n371.1\n(c) through\n(g) of this Title subsequent to the point of\ngeneration (including deactivated characteristic hazardous wastes managed in\nwastewater treatment systems subject to the Clean Water Act [CWA] as specified\nin section\n371.1\n[e][1][ii]\nof\nthis Title, or that are CWA-equivalent), or are managed in an underground\ninjection well regulated by the SDWA and permitted under SPDES, the generator\nmust place a one-time notice describing such generation, subsequent exclusion\nfrom the definition of hazardous or solid waste or exemption from hazardous\nwaste regulation, Parts 370 through 374 and Part 376, of this Title, and the\ndisposition of the waste, in the facility's on-site files. (viii)\n\nGenerators must retain on-site a copy\nof all notices, certifications, waste analysis data, and other documentation\nproduced pursuant to this subdivision for at least three years from the date\nthat the waste that is the subject of such documentation was last sent to\non-site or off-site treatment, storage, or disposal. The three year record\nretention period is automatically extended during the course of any unresolved\nenforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the\ncommissioner. The requirements of this paragraph apply to solid wastes even\nwhen the hazardous characteristic is removed prior to disposal, or when the\nwaste is excluded from the definition of hazardous or solid waste under section\n371.1\n(c) through\n(g) of this Title, or exempted from hazardous\nwaste regulations, Parts 370 through 374 and 376 of this Title, subsequent to\nthe point of generation. (ix)\n\nIf a\ngenerator is managing a lab pack containing hazardous wastes and wishes to use\nthe alternative treatment standard for lab packs found in section\n376.4\n(c)(3)\nof\nthis Part: (a) With the initial shipment of\nwaste to a treatment facility, the generator must submit a notice that provides\nthe information in column \"section\n376.1\n(g)(1)(ix)\n\"\nin the Generator Paperwork Requirements Table of subparagraph (iv) of this\nparagraph, and the following certification, which must be signed by an\nauthorized representative: \"I certify under penalty of law that I personally have\nexamined and I am familiar with the waste and that the lab pack contains only\nwastes that have not been excluded under 6 NYCRR Appendix 38 and that this lab\npack will be sent to a combustion facility in compliance with the alternative\ntreatment standards for lab packs in 6 NYCRR section\n376.4\n(c)(3). I am\naware that there are significant penalties for submitting a false\ncertification, including the possibility of fine or\nimprisonment.\"\n(a) A copy of\nthe notice and certification statement must be placed in the generator's\nfiles. (b) No further notification\nis necessary until such time that the wastes in the lab pack change, or the\nreceiving facility changes, in which case a new notice and certification must\nbe sent and a copy placed in the generator's file. (c) If the lab pack contains characteristic\nhazardous wastes (D001-D043), underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in\nparagraph [b][1] of this section) need not be determined. (d) The generator must also comply with the\nrequirements in subparagraphs (vi) and (vii) of this\nparagraph. (x) Small\nquantity generators with tolling agreements pursuant to section\n372.2\n(b)(7)\nof\nthis Title must comply with the applicable notification and certification\nrequirements of this paragraph for the initial shipment of the waste subject to\nthe agreement. Such generators must retain on-site a copy of the notification\nand certification, together with the tolling agreement, for at least three\nyears after termination or expiration of the agreement. The three year record\nretention period is automatically extended during the course of any unresolved\nenforcement action regarding the regulated activity or as requested by the\ncommissioner. (2)\n\nRequirements for treatment facilities: Treatment facilities must test their\nwastes according to the frequency specified in their waste analysis plan as\nrequired by section\n373-2.2\n(e) (for\npermitted TSD's) or 373-3.2(d) (for interim status of facilities) of this\n\nTitle. Such testing must be performed as provided in subparagraphs (i), (ii)\nand (iii) of this paragraph. (i) For wastes\nor contaminated soil with treatment standards expressed as concentrations in\nthe waste extract (TCLP), the owner or operator of the treatment facility must\ntest an extract of the treatment residues, using test method 1311 (the Toxicity\n\nCharacteristic Leaching Procedure, described in \"Test Methods for Evaluating\n\nSolid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" EPA Publication SW-846 as incorporated\nby reference in section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle), to assure that the treatment residues extract meet the applicable\ntreatment standards. (ii)\n\nFor\nwastes or contaminated soil with treatment standards expressed as\nconcentrations in the waste, the owner or operator of the treatment facility\nmust test the treatment residues (not an extract of such residues) to assure\nthat they meet the applicable treatment standards. (iii)\nA one time notice must be sent with the\ninitial shipment of waste or contaminated soil to the land disposal facility. A\ncopy of the notice must be placed in the treatment facility's file. (a) No further notification is necessary\nuntil such time that the waste or receiving facility change, in which case a\nnew notice must be sent and a copy placed in the treatment facility's\nfile.

(4)\n\nGenerators or\ntreaters who first claim that hazardous debris is excluded from the definition\nof hazardous waste under section\n371.1\n(d)(5)\nof\nthis Title, (\ni.e., debris treated by an extraction or\ndestruction technology provided by Table 1, section\n376.4\n[g]\nof this\n\nPart, and debris that the commissioner has determined does not contain\nhazardous waste) are subject to the following notification and certification\nrequirements: (i) a one-time notification, including the following information, must be submitted to the commissioner: (a) the name and address of the authorized\n\nPart 360 facility receiving the treated debris; (b) a description of the hazardous debris as\ninitially generated, including the applicable EPA or NYS hazardous waste\nnumber(s); and\n(c) for debris\nexcluded under section\n371.1\n(d)(5)(i)\nof\nthis Title, the technology from Table 1, section\n376.4\n(g) of this\n\nPart, used to treat the debris; (ii)\nthe notification must be updated if the\ndebris is shipped to a different facility, and, for debris excluded under\nsection\n371.1\n(d)(5)(i)\nof\nthis Title, if a different type of debris is treated or if a different\ntechnology is used to treat the debris; (iii)\nfor debris excluded under section\n371.1\n(d)(5)(i)\nof\nthis Title, the owner or operator of the treatment facility must document and\ncertify compliance with the treatment standards in Table 1, section\n376.4\n(g) of this\n\nPart as follows: (a) records must be kept of\nall inspections, evaluations, and analyses of treated debris that are made to\ndetermine compliance with the treatment standards; (b) records must be kept of any data or\ninformation the treater obtains during treatment of the debris that identifies\nkey operating parameters of the treatment unit, and; (c) for each shipment of treated debris, a\ncertification of compliance with the treatment standards must be signed by an\nauthorized representative and placed in the facility's files. The certification\nmust state the following: \"I certify under penalty of law that the debris has been\ntreated in accordance with the requirements of 6 NYCRR\n376.4\n(g). I am aware\nthat there are significant penalties for making a false certification, including the possibility of fine and\nimprisonment.\"\n(5)\n\nGenerators and treaters who first receive\nfrom USEPA or the State a determination that a given contaminated soil subject\nto LDRs as provided in section\n376.4\n(k)(1)\nof\nthis Part no longer contains a listed hazardous waste and generators and\ntreaters who first determine that a contaminated soil subject to LDRs as\nprovided in section\n376.4\n(k)(1)\nof\nthis Part no longer exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste must: (i) prepare a one-time only documentation of\nthese determinations including all supporting information; and\n(ii)\nmaintain that information in the\nfacility files and other records for a minimum of three years. (h) Special rules\nregarding wastes that exhibit a characteristic. (1)\n\nThe initial generator of a solid waste\nmust determine each EPA hazardous waste number (waste code) applicable to the\nwaste in order to determine the applicable treatment standards under section\n376.4\nof this Part. This\ndetermination may be made concurrently with the hazardous waste determination\nrequired in section\n372.2\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Title. For purposes of this Part, the waste will carry the waste code for\nany applicable listed waste (section\n371.4\nof this Title). In addition, where the waste exhibits a characteristic, the waste will carry one or more of\nthe characteristic waste codes (section\n371.3\nof this Title), except when\nthe treatment standard for the listed waste operates in lieu of the treatment\nstandards for the characteristic waste, as specified in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. If the generator determines that their waste displays a hazardous\ncharacteristic (and is not D001 nonwastewaters treated by CMBST, RORGS, or\nPOLYM of section\n376.4\n[c], Table 1\nof this Part), the generator must determine the underlying hazardous\nconstituents (as defined in paragraph [b][1] of this section), in the\ncharacteristic waste. (2)\n\nWhere a\nprohibited waste is both listed under section\n371.4\nof this Title and exhibits a\ncharacteristic under section\n371.3, the treatment standard for\nthe waste code listed in section\n371.4\nwill operate in lieu of the\nstandard for the waste code under section\n371.3, provided that the treatment\nstandard for the listed waste includes a treatment standard for the constituent\nthat causes the waste to exhibit the characteristic. Otherwise, the waste must\nmeet the treatment standards for all applicable listed and characteristic waste\ncodes. (3)\n\nIn addition to any\napplicable standards determined from the initial point of generation, no\nprohibited waste which exhibits a characteristic under section\n371.3\nof this Title may be land\ndisposed unless the waste complies with the treatment standards under section\n376.4\nof this Part. (4)\n\nWastes that exhibit a characteristic are\nalso subject to subdivision (g) of this section requirements, except that once\nthe waste is no longer hazardous, a one-time notification and certification\nmust be placed in the generators' or treaters' on-site files. The notification\nand certification must be updated if the process or operation generating the\nwaste changes and/or if the Part 360 facility receiving the waste changes. (i) The notification must include the\nfollowing information: (a) the name and\naddress of the authorized Part 360 facility receiving the waste shipment; and\n(b) a description of the waste\nas initially generated, including the applicable EPA hazardous waste code(s), treatability group(s) and underlying hazardous constituents (as defined in\nsubdivision [b] of this section), unless the waste will be treated and\nmonitored for all underlying hazardous constituents. If all underlying\nhazardous constituents will be treated and monitored, there is no requirement\nto list any of the underlying hazardous constituents on the\nnotice. (ii)\n\nThe\ncertification must be signed by an authorized representative and must state the\nlanguage found in subparagraph (g)(2)(iv) of this section. (a) If treatment removes the characteristic\nbut does not meet standards applicable to underlying hazardous constituents, then the certification found in clause (g)(2)(iv)(\nd\n) of this\nsection applies.
