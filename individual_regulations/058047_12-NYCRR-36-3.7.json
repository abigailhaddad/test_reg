This section contains the requirements for the design of grandstands\nand bleachers of all types both for indoor and outdoor use. It applies to both\nexisting and new structures except as otherwise expressly provided. (b) Definitions. As used in this section, the\nfollowing terms will be deemed to have the meanings listed below. (1)\n\nGrandstand. Any permanent or temporary\nstructure intended primarily to support an assemblage of spectators and\ndesigned to remain in one specific location. It does not apply to the permanent\nseating arrangements in theatres and assembly halls. (2)\n\nPortable stands or bleachers. Assemblies\nof prefabricated units, readily erected, dismantled and transported and used or\nintended for use as movable or temporary supports for persons. Sectional\nnon-foldable bleachers are included under this term. (3)\n\nFoldable stands or bleachers. Movable\ntypes of seating arrangements that may be closed into a compact unit, the seat\nsupporting members being so connected that the unit will fold or telescope into\na relatively small space without being dismantled. (c) Design, construction and maintenance. (1)\n\nGrandstands and bleachers permanent or\nportable, shall be designed, constructed and maintained to support in addition\nto their own weight, a uniformly distributed live load of not less than 100\npounds per square foot of gross horizontal projection of the grandstand or\nsimilar structure. All seats and footboard members shall be designed for live\nloads of not less than 120 pounds per linear foot. (2)\n\nSuch structures if used outdoors or in\ntents shall be designed, constructed and maintained to resist, with or without\nlive load, a horizontal wind load of 30 pounds per square foot of all vertical\nprojections of the stand. (3)\n\nSuch\nstructures shall be designed, constructed and maintained to resist a horizontal\nswaying force applied to the seats in a direction parallel to the length of the\nseats, of 24 pounds per linear foot of seats, and in a direction perpendicular\nto the length of the seats, of 10 pounds per linear foot of seats. (d) Railings. Every floor level, seat platform, bleacher seat, deck, stairway, ramp or aisle which is occupied\nby the public and is more than two feet above the adjacent ground or floor\nlevel, shall have at all open sides or sections thereof a protective railing or\nguard at least 36 inches high. (e) Seats. (1)\n\nThe highest level of any seat\nplatform in a wood grandstand shall not exceed 12 feet above the ground or\nother surface below it if such grandstand is within a tent, nor 20 feet above\nthe ground or other surface below it if such grandstand is otherwise\nlocated. (2)\n\nSeats permanently\nfixed to such platforms shall not exceed 20 in any row between aisles, nor 10\nin any row between an aisle and a railing or wall. (3)\n\nSeats not permanently fixed to such\nplatform shall be used in rows only when arranged in rigid units of five or\nmore and secured against displacement. Such seats shall not exceed 15 in any\nrow between aisles nor 10 in any row between an aisle and a railing or\nwall. (4)\n\nStep-type continuous\nseats with or without backs shall not exceed 30 in any row between aisles nor\n15 between an aisle and a railing or wall; except, however, that they shall not\nexceed 20 and 10, respectively, in a place of wood construction. (5)\n\nFor continuous benches or bleacher\nseating without separating arms between seats, 18 inches of bench length shall\nconstitute one seat. (6)\n\nRows of\nseats with backs shall be at least 27 inches back to back, if without backs, 22\ninches. Clearance between the back of one row and the front of the row behind\nit shall be at least eight inches. (f) Aisles and crossaisles in permanent\ngrandstands. (1)\n\nThe minimum width of\nlongitudinal aisles with seats on both sides shall be 36 inches and with seats\non one side only, 30 inches. Such widths shall be considered as having\ncapacities of 150 and 125 persons, respectively. Every such aisle having an\nexit at only one end shall be increased in width toward the exit to provide a\nclear width of at least 12 inches for each 50 persons served. When a means of\nexit is provided at both ends, such aisles may be of average required width\nthroughout subject to the required minimum width. The minimum width of\ncrossaisles shall be 36 inches and in no case less than 12 inches for each 50\npersons served. (2)\n\nThe number of\nrows of seats between crossaisles shall not exceed 20 for the first or a single\nbank of seats, nor 15 for the second bank. When there is only one crossaisle\nabove or below a bank of seats the number of rows of seats exiting to such\ncrossaisle shall not exceed 15 for any first or single bank, nor 10 for the\nsecond bank. No crossaisles shall be required between rows of seats located\nbetween an aisle and a railing or wall. (3)\n\nBoxes do not constitute banks of seats\nbut their capacity shall be included in the calculation of aisle and exit\nwidths. Boxes shall have direct access to a crossaisle. (4)\n\nThe distance between exits from a\ncrossaisle shall not exceed 100 feet, except that where the length of a\ncrossaisle does not exceed 50 feet it may be served by only one exit. (5)\n\nNo step is permitted in any\ncrossaisle. (6)\n\nSteps in aisles\nshall be the full width of the aisle. No riser shall exceed eight inches in\nheight and no tread shall be less than 10 inches in width. (g) Portable and foldable bleachers. (1)\n\nPortable and foldable grandstands shall\nconform to the requirements of this section and also to the following special\nrequirements which shall take precedence in the event of any\nvariance. (2)\n\nBleacher sections\nshall contain not more than 24 rows of seats. (3)\n\nAisles at least 36 inches wide shall be\nprovided if there are 12 or more rows of seats or if the vertical distance\nbetween seats exceeds 14 inches. (4)\n\nThe open ends of all bleacher sections\nshall be provided with guard railings at least 36 inches high for that portion\nof the stand above the fourth row of seats. The backs of all sections which are\nnot placed against a wall shall also be guarded in the same way. (5)\n\nIf any bleacher section is set on a\nplatform raised above the floor or ground, a crossaisle and guard railing shall\nbe provided at the front of such section. (6)\n\nProprietary or patented bleachers of the\nrollaway, telescopic or fold-up type shall be approved. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
