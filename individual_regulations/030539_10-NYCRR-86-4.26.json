  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 86-4.26 - Sales, leases and realty transactions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a facility is sold or leased or is the subject of any other realty transaction before a rate for the facility has been determined and certified by the commissioner, the capital cost component of such rate shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of sections\n86-4.20, 86-4.23, 86-4.24\nand 86- 4.25 of this Subpart. (b) If a facility is sold or leased or is the subject of any other realty transaction after a rate for the facility has been determined and certified by the commissioner, the capital cost component of such rate shall continue with the same force and effect as if such sale, lease or other realty transaction had not occurred. This subdivision shall not be construed as limiting the powers and rights of the commissioner to change rate computations based upon previous error, deceit or any other misrepresentation or misstatement that has let the commissioner to determine and certify a rate which he would otherwise not have determined or certified. Further, this subdivision shall not be construed as limiting the powers and rights of the commissioner to reduce rates when one or more of the original property right aspects related to a facility is terminated. (c) If a facility enters into a sale and leaseback agreement with a nonrelated purchaser involving plant facilities or equipment prior to October 23, 1992 the incurred rental specified in the agreement shall be included in allowable costs if the following conditions are met: (1)\nthe rental charges are reasonable based on consideration of rental charges of comparable equipment and market conditions in the area; the type, expected life, condition and value of the equipment rented and other provisions of the rental agreements; (2)\nadequate alternate equipment which would serve the purpose are not or were not available at lower cost; and\n(3)\nthe leasing was based on economic and technical considerations. (4)\n\nIf all these conditions were not met, the rental charge cannot exceed the amount which the facility would have included in reimbursable costs had it retained legal title to the equipment, such as interest, taxes, depreciation, insurance and maintenance costs. (5)\n\nIf a facility enters into a sale and leaseback agreement with a nonrelated purchaser involving land, the incurred rental costs associated with the land are not includable in allowable costs. (d) An arms length lease purchase agreement with a nonrelated lessor involving plant facilities or equipment entered into on or after October 23, 1992 which meets any one of the four following conditions, establishes the lease as a virtual purchase. (1)\n\nThe lease transfers title of the facilities or equipment to the lessee during the lease term. (2)\n\nThe lease contains a bargain purchase option. (3)\n\nThe lease term is at least 75 percent of the useful life of the facilities or equipment. This provision is not applicable if the lease begins in the last 25 percent of the useful life of the facilities or equipment. (4)\n\nThe present value of the minimum lease payments (payments to be made during the lease term including bargain purchase option, guaranteed residual value and penalties for failure to renew) equals at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the leased property. This provision is not applicable if the lease begins in the last 25 percent of the useful life of the facilities or equipment. Present value is computed using the lessee's incremental borrowing rate, unless the interest rate implicit in the lease is known and is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing rate, in which case the interest rate implicit in the lease is used. (e) If a lease is established as a virtual purchase under subdivision (d) of this section, the rental charge is includable in capital-related costs to the extent that it does not exceed the amount that the provider would have included in capital-related costs if it had legal title to the asset (the cost of ownership). The cost of ownership shall be limited to depreciation and interest. Further, the amounts to be included in capital-related costs are determined as follows: (1)\n\nThe difference between the amount of rent paid and the amount of rent allowed as capital-related costs is considered a deferred charge and is capitalized as part of the historical cost of the asset when the asset is purchased. (2)\n\nIf an asset is returned to the owner instead of being purchased, the deferred charge may be included in capital-related costs in the year the asset is returned. (3)\n\nIf the term of the lease is extended for an additional period of time at a reduced lease cost and the option to purchase still exists, the deferred charge may be included in capital-related costs to the extent of increasing the reduced rental to an amount not in excess of the cost of ownership. (4)\n\nIf the term of the lease is extended for an additional period of time at a reduced lease cost and the option to purchase no longer exists, the deferred charge may be included in capital-related costs to the extent of increasing the reduced rental to a fair rental value. (5)\n\nIf the lessee becomes the owner of the leased asset (either by operation of the lease or by other means), the amount considered as depreciation for the purpose of having computed the limitation on rental charges under this subdivision, must be used in calculating the limitation on adjustments for the purpose of determining any gain or loss upon disposal of an asset. (6)\n\nIn the aggregate, the amount of rental or lease costs included in capital-related costs may not exceed the amount of the costs of ownership that the provider could have included in capital-related costs had the provider legal title to the asset. (f) If a facility enters into a sale and leaseback agreement involving plant facilities or equipment on or after October 23, 1992, the amounts to be included in capital-related costs both on an annual basis and over the useful life of the asset shall not exceed the costs of ownership, which shall be limited to depreciation and interest, and shall be determined as follows: (1)\n\nIf the annual rental or lease cost in the early years of the lease are less than the annual costs of ownership, but in the later years of the lease the annual rental or lease costs are more than the annual costs of ownership, in the years that the annual rental or lease costs are more than the annual costs of ownership, the facility may include in capital-related costs annually the actual amount of rental for lease costs, except that in any given year, the amount included in capital-related costs is limited to an amount which would not cause the aggregate rental or lease costs included up to that year in capital-related costs to exceed the costs of ownership that would have been included in capital-related costs up to that year if the provider had retained legal title to the asset. (2)\n\nIf the annual rental or lease costs in the early years of the lease exceed the annual costs of ownership, which shall be limited to depreciation and interest, but in the later years of the lease the annual rental or lease costs are less than the annual costs of ownership, the facility may carry forward amounts of rental or lease costs that were not included in capital-related costs in the early years of the lease due to the costs of ownership limitation, and include these amounts in capital-related costs in the years of the lease when the annual rental or lease costs are less than the annual costs of ownership, provided, however, in any given year the amount of actual annual rental or lease costs plus the amount carried forward to that year may not exceed the amount of the costs of ownership for that year. (3)\n\nIn the aggregate, the amount of rental or lease costs included in capital-related costs may not exceed the amount of the costs of ownership that the provider could have included in capital-related costs if the provider had retained legal title to the asset. (4)\n\nIf a facility enters into a sale and leaseback agreement involving land, the incurred rental for the cost of land is not includable in allowable costs. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
