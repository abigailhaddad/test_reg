Tit. 9 § 2206.2 - Injunctions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe administrator may, whenever in his judgment any\nperson has engaged in or is about to engage in acts or practices which\nconstitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of section Y51-10.0\nof the Rent Law, apply to the Supreme Court for an order (a) enjoining such\nacts or practices, (b) enforcing compliance with such provision of said section\nor with an order issued by the administrator, or (c) directing the landlord to\ncorrect such violation of such provision; and upon sufficient showing, the\n\nSupreme Court may issue a temporary or permanent injunction, restraining order\nor other order, all of which shall be granted without bond. Jurisdiction shall\nnot be deemed lacking in the Supreme Court because a defense is based upon\norder of an inferior court. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n2206.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
