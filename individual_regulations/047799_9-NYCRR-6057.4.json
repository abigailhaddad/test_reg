(e) If\nthe division determines there is reasonable cause to believe that an authorized\ninternet entity is engaged in a pattern or practice of misuse of the sex\noffender internet identifiers, the division is authorized to terminate an\nauthorized internet entity's subscription to access sex offender internet\nidentifiers.
