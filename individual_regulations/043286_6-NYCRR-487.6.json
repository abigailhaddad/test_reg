Tit. 6 § 487.6 - Preparation and content of the environmental justice analysis\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section sets forth the general\nrequirements and procedures for completing an EJ analysis. The applicant's EJ\nanalysis and its use of these procedures, and any studies or reports relied\nupon by the applicant to conduct its EJ analysis, shall inform the board's\nfindings regarding whether the construction and operation of the proposed\nfacility will result in or contribute to any significant and adverse\ndisproportionate environmental impacts, and whether the applicant will avoid, offset or minimize the impacts caused by the facility to the maximum extent\npracticable. (b) Pre-application\nrequirements. (1)\n\nThe applicant's EJ analysis\nshall be initiated early in the pre-application process to facilitate an\nexpeditious pre-application process and to enable early and meaningful public\ninvolvement. (2)\n\nThe EJ analysis\nshall be developed as fully as practicable during the pre-application process\nto ensure that the applicant's final EJ analysis submitted with its application\nincludes a complete evaluation of any significant and adverse disproportionate\nenvironmental impacts of the proposed facility. (3)\n\nThe applicant shall in all cases include\nin its preliminary scoping statement the following preliminary information: (i) a preliminary description of the size and\nlocation of the impact study area based on the criteria set forth in section\n487.4\nof this Part; and\n(ii)\nwhether or not one or more EJ areas are\npresent within the impact study area determined pursuant to section\n487.5\n(b) and (c)\nof this Part and, if an EJ area(s) is present, the location and description of\nthe EJ area(s). (4)\n\nIf\nthe applicant's preliminary scoping statement identifies any reasonable and\navailable alternate locations to the proposed facility, the applicant shall\ncomply with the requirements of paragraph (3) of this subdivision for each\nalternate location. (5)\n\nIf an\napplicant has identified that an EJ area is present within the impact study\narea, the applicant shall include in its preliminary scoping statement the\nfollowing additional information as is reasonably available, generally in the\nform (though in less detail) that it will appear in the application: (i) a narrative explaining the cumulative\nimpact analysis of air quality proposed to be completed by the applicant\npursuant to section\n487.7\nof this Part; (ii)\na preliminary description of the size\nand location of the comparison areas identified pursuant to section\n487.8\nof this Part; (iii)\npreliminary demographic, economic and\nphysical descriptions of the impact study area and each comparison area\nrequired pursuant to section\n487.9\nof this Part; (iv)\na detailed description of the proposed\napproach for evaluating and comparing the physical conditions of the impact\nstudy area and the comparison areas; and a preliminary evaluation of any\npotentially significant and adverse disproportionate environmental impacts in\nthe impact study area pursuant to section\n487.10\nof this Part; (v) the proposed measures to avoid, offset or\nminimize any significant and adverse disproportionate environmental impacts\npursuant to section\n487.10\nof this Part; and\n(vi)\nany studies or program of studies the\napplicant proposes to undertake to support its final EJ analysis, to the extent\nnot identified in the information supplied in response to subparagraphs (i)\nthrough (v) of this paragraph. (6)\n\nIf the applicant's preliminary scoping\nstatement identifies any reasonable and available alternate locations to the\nproposed facility, and the impact study area of any identified alternate\nlocation includes an EJ area, the applicant shall comply with the requirements\nof paragraph (5) of this subdivision for each such alternate\nlocation. (7)\n\nThe applicant's\npreliminary EJ analysis shall be clearly and concisely written in plain\nlanguage so that it can be read and understood by the public and stakeholders, and include as much information as practicable to provide stakeholders with a\nclear indication of the scope of the applicant's final EJ analysis. (8)\n\nUpon receipt of the applicant's\npreliminary scoping statement, the department may provide guidance to the\napplicant, as necessary, to supplement its preliminary EJ information. The\ndepartment, on its own or in cooperation with stakeholders may enter into\nstipulations related to the applicant's final EJ analysis. (9)\n\nIf: (i) the applicant has met the requirements of subdivisions (1) through (3) of PSL\nsection 163; (ii)\npre-application\nintervenor funds have been disbursed; (iii)\nthe public and stakeholders have had an\nopportunity to comment on the preliminary scoping statement; and\n(iv)\nthe stipulation process has closed, and\nno EJ area is present within the impact study area, the applicant's required EJ\nanalysis is complete. (10)\n\nAfter providing the public and\nstakeholders with an opportunity to comment on its preliminary scoping\nstatement, the applicant may choose to undertake a full EJ analysis although it\nis not required. In this case, the applicant may revise its scoping statement\nto include the additional information required in paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision or may use the stipulation process to obtain agreement on the scope\nof its final EJ analysis. (c) Application requirements. (1)\n\nIf an EJ area is present within the\nimpact study area, or the applicant has concluded during the pre-application\nprocess that it should complete a full EJ analysis, the applicant shall include\nas a part of its application a final EJ analysis, including the following\ninformation: (i) the size and location of the\nimpact study area defined pursuant to section\n487.4\nof this Part; (ii)\nthe location and a description of any EJ\narea(s) present within the impact study area identified pursuant to section\n487.5\nof this Part; (iii)\na cumulative impact analysis of air\nquality pursuant to the requirements of section\n487.7\nof this Part; (iv)\nthe size and location of each comparison\narea identified pursuant to section\n487.8\nof this Part; (v) the comprehensive demographic, economic\nand physical descriptions of the impact study area and comparison areas\npursuant to the requirements of section\n487.9\nof this Part; (vi)\nan evaluation of any significant and\nadverse disproportionate environmental impacts in the impact study area\npursuant to the requirements of section\n487.10\nof this Part; (vii)\na discussion of the measures to avoid, offset or minimize any significant and adverse disproportionate impacts in the\nimpact study area pursuant to the requirements of section\n487.10\n(d) of this\n\nPart; (viii)\nany studies or program\nof studies used to support the applicant's final EJ analysis; and\n(ix)\na statement of environmental justice\nissues pursuant to the requirements of section\n487.11\nof this Part. (2)\n\nIf the applicant identifies\nany reasonable and available alternate locations to the proposed facility in\nits application, and the impact study area of any alternate location includes\nan EJ area, the applicant shall comply with the requirements of this\nsubdivision for each such alternate location. (3)\n\nThe applicant's final EJ analysis shall\nbe clearly and concisely written in plain language so that it can be read and\nunderstood by the public and stakeholders. (4)\n\nThe applicant's final EJ analysis shall\ncontain all relevant and material facts and include sufficient detail about the\nnature and magnitude of any significant and adverse disproportionate\nenvironmental impacts of the proposed facility to enable the board to make\nexplicit findings related to EJ issues.
