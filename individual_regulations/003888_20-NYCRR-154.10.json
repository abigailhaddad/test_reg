  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 154.10 - Special accruals\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 654(c)\n(a) Where the resident status of an\nindividual or of a trust changes from resident to nonresident, such individual\nor trust must, regardless of the method of accounting normally employed, accrue\nand include, on the New York State income tax return and any schedules require\nto be filed with such return for the portion of the year prior to the change of\nresident status, any items of income, gain, loss or deduction (and any New York\nitems of tax preference) accruing prior to the change of residence, if not\notherwise properly includible or allowable for New York State income tax\npurposes or New York State minimum income tax purposes for such portion of the\ntaxable year or for a prior taxable year. That is, in computing New York\ntaxable income, New York personal service taxable income and New York State\nminimum taxable income for the resident period, such individual or trust must\ninclude all items required to be included if a Federal income tax return were\nbeing filed for the same period on the accrual basis, together with any other\naccruals such as deferred gain on installment obligations which are not\notherwise includible or deductible for Federal or New York State income tax\npurposes or for Federal or New York State minimum income tax purposes either\nfor such resident period or for a prior taxable period. See sections\n154.11\nand\n154.12\nof this Part for relief from the accrual requirements of this section and for\nthe special accruals relating to the ordinary income portion of lump sum\ndistributions, respectively. (b) (1)\n\nFor example, if an individual sells his\nbusiness at a gain, under contract whereby the purchase price is to be paid in\ninstallments, and later changes his status from resident to nonresident, he\nmust accrue, on the New York State personal income tax return for the resident\nperiod, the entire amount of the gain remaining unpaid from such installment\nobligations, regardless of the method of accounting he normally uses in\nreporting his transactions. Furthermore, any long-term capital gain which he\nrealized as a result of the installment sale would also be required to be\naccrued and taken into consideration in determining the New York items of tax\npreference to be included in computing the New York State minimum income tax on\nthe\n\nNew York State Minimum Income Tax Computation Schedule, which is required to be filed for the New York State resident period if the New\n\nYork items of tax preference exceed the allowable specific deduction. (See Part\n122 of this Title.)\n(2)\n\nIf a trust\nsells its business or assets of the trust at a gain, under a contract whereby\nthe purchase price is to be paid in installments, and the trust later changes\nits status from resident to nonresident, the fiduciary of the trust must\naccrue, on the New York State fiduciary return for the resident period, the\nentire amount of the gain remaining unpaid from such installment obligations, regardless of the method of accounting the trust normally uses in reporting\nsuch transactions. Where such gains from installment sales are long-term\ncapital gains, a\n\nNew York State Minimum Income Tax Computation\n\nSchedule\nmust be filed by the trust for its resident period to include\nthe accrued New York items of tax preference attributable to the trust if its\n\nNew York items of tax preference exceed its allowable specific deduction. (See\n\nPart 122 of this Title.)\n(3)\n\nWhere\na beneficiary of an estate or trust (including an individual or a trust)\nchanges status during the taxable year from resident to nonresident, such\nindividual or trust must accrue, on the New York State income tax return for\nthe resident period, any estate or trust income credited, distributable, payable or required to be distributed to such beneficiary as of the date of\nsuch beneficiary's change of residence. (c) However, a gain which is not recognized\nfor Federal income tax purposes need not be accrued for New York State income\ntax purposes solely because of the change of residence. For instance, a gain\nrealized on the sale of an individual's principal residence, if it is not\nrecognized for Federal income tax purposes by virtue of the provisions of the\n\nInternal Revenue Code relating to the acquisition of a new residence, need not\nbe accrued on the individual's New York State personal income tax return for\nthe period prior to such individual's change of residence. (d) The amounts of the accrued items of an\nindividual to be reported on the New York State personal income tax return, and\nany schedules required to be filed with such return, for the period of New York\n\nState residence are determined with the applicable modifications described in\n\nParts 112, 115 and 122 of this Title as if such accrued items were includible\nor allowable for Federal income tax purposes. Similarly, the amounts of the\naccrued items of a trust to be reported on its New York State fiduciary return\nfor its period of New York State residence are determined with the applicable\nmodifications described in Parts 112, 115, 118 and 122 of this Title as if such\naccrued items were includible or allowable for Federal income tax purposes. See\nsubdivision (g) of this section, where an individual or trust changes residence\nduring the taxable year, for statements which must be attached to the New York\n\nState income tax returns required under this Part. Example: On September 10, 1985, A, a cash-basis calendar-year\ntaxpayer residing in New York State, terminated his employment in New York\n\nState and moved to Florida. A's salary up to the date of termination amounted\nto $8,000. On September 1, 1985 A's employer notified him that, under A's\nemployment contract, A would receive on October 1, 1985 a bonus of $1,000, subject to no contingencies. Dividend income received before the change of residence\namounted to $550, and on August 15, 1985 the XYX Corporation declared a\ndividend of $600, payable to A on September 20, 1985 as a stockholder of record\non September 6, 1985. A also held State of California bonds on which interest\nin the amount of $300 was received on the first day of each calendar quarter, viz: January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1, 1985. On January 2, 1985, A closed title with C on a tract of\nvacant land in Pennsylvania, taking back from C a purchase money mortgage which\ncalled for annual payments on July 1 of each year. By reason of A's Federal\nelection of the installment method of accounting with respect to this\ntransaction. A will realize a long-term capital gain of $1,000 each year for\nfive years, or $5,000. On September 1, 1985, A entered into a contract with B\nto sell A's beach property in New York State, subject to B's investigation of\ntitle and obtaining a stipulated mortgage. The property to be sold was not A's\nprincipal residence and was not used for rental purposes. The closing of title\nfor this property was held on October 20, 1985. A realized a long-term capital\ngain of $20,000 which was included in determining the gain from the sale or\nexchange of property reported on A's 1985 Federal income tax return. For 1985, A filed two New York State personal income\ntax returns, one as a resident and one as a nonresident. On A's 1985 New York\n\nState personal income tax return for the portion of the year during which A was\na resident, A included in New York adjusted gross income the following\nitems: Regular salary\n$8,000\n\nBonus-not forfeitable\n$1,000\n\nDividends received (after exclusion)\n$ 450\n\nDividends accrued as of record date\n$ 600\n\nGain on sale of Pennsylvania property ($1,000 a/c\n1985 payment $4,000 accrued, less 6%; long-term capital gain deduction)\n$2,000\n\nModification under section\n112.2\n(a) of this Title for California bond interest ($900 received on January 1, April 1\nand July 1, plus $233 accrued on account of interest payable October 1)\n$1,133\n\nBased on the foregoing, A's New York items of tax\npreference, applicable to the period of New York State residence, did not\nexceed the allowable specific deduction (see Part 122 of this Title). Therefore, A was not required to file a\n\nNew York State Minimum Income\n\nTax Computation Schedule\n(form IT-220) for the period of New York\n\nState residence. (See also section 54.5(a)(4) and (5) of this Part.)\n\nOn A's 1985 New York State nonresident personal income\ntax return, A included in New York adjusted gross income the following items\nderived from or connected with New York State sources: Long-term capital gain on the sale of New York\n\nState beach property, less 60% long-term capital gain deduction\n$8,000\n\nThe gain from the sale of the New York State beach\nproperty was not accruable for the portion of the year when A was a resident\nbecause of the conditions stated in the contract of sale. Because A reported the bonus payment on his New York\n\nState personal income tax return for the resident portion of 1985, A was not\nrequired to take it into account on his New York State nonresident personal\nincome tax return as an item of income derived from New York State sources even\nthough A actually received this item of income when A was a nonresident. See\nsubdivision (f) of this section. Since A's New York items of tax preference, applicable\nto the period of New York State nonresidence, exceeded the allowable specific\ndeduction (see Part 141 of this Title), A was required to complete a\n\nNew York State Minimum Income Tax Computation Schedule\nfor the\nperiod of New York State nonresidence. (See also section\n154.5\n(a)(4)\nof this Part.)\n(e) Where the\nresident status of an individual or of a trust changes from nonresident to\nresident, such individual or trust must, regardless of the method of accounting\nnormally employed, accrue, for the portion of the year prior to such change, any items of income, gain, loss or deduction accruing prior to the change of\nresident status, other than those items of income, gain, loss or deduction\nwhich are derived from or connected with New York State sources, if not\notherwise properly includible (whether or not because of an election to report\non an installment basis) or allowable for Federal income tax purposes for such\nportion of the taxable year or for a prior taxable year. The amounts of such\naccrued items of an individual are determined, with the applicable\nmodifications described in Parts 112, 115 and 122 of this Title, as if such\naccrued items were includible or allowable for Federal income tax purposes. Similarly, the amounts of such accrued items of a trust are determined, with\nthe applicable modifications described in Parts 112, 115, 118 and 122 of this\n\nTitle, as if such accrued items were includible or allowable for Federal income\ntax purposes. See subdivision (g) of this section, where an individual or trust\nchanges residence during the taxable year, for statements which must be\nattached to the New York State personal income tax returns required under this\n\nPart. Also see section\n154.12\nof this Part for special accruals relating to ordinary income portion of lump\nsum distributions. (f) No items of\nincome, gain, loss or deduction, accrued under this section for the portion of\nthe taxable year prior to a change of resident status, are to be taken into\naccount in determining the New York adjusted gross income, the New York\nitemized deduction, the New York personal service taxable income and the New\n\nYork State minimum taxable income of an individual, or the New York taxable\nincome, the New York personal service taxable income and the New York State\nminimum taxable income of a trust, for any subsequent taxable period. Example: B, a cash-basis calendar-year taxpayer residing in\n\nCalifornia, performed services as an employee in California in July 1979, for\nwhich he was to be paid $10,000 in September 1979. B also owned New York State\nreal estate which he leased for $500 per month. The rent was paid for the first\nfour months of 1979 but no rent was paid from May 1, 1979 to December 31, 1979, when all arrears were paid up. The taxpayer, away from home on business in\n\nJuly, had travel expenses of $1,000 which were billed on August 1, 1979. On August 10, 1979, B moved to New York State where, on\n\nSeptember 1, 1979, he received the $10,000 payable for his services performed\nin California and paid the travel expense bill. He had no other income or\ndeduction of the year 1979. B was required to file two New York State personal\nincome tax returns for 1979, one as a nonresident and one as a resident. The\n$10,000 compensation for his services in California and the $1,000 travel\nexpenses were accrued as of the change of residence, and were not included in\nB's New York adjusted gross income because he was a nonresident prior to the\nchange of residence and these amounts were not derived from or connected with\n\nNew York State sources. The rental from New York State real estate remaining\nunpaid as of the change of residence was not accrued because it was derived\nfrom New York State sources; see subdivision (e) of this section. Accordingly, on his New York State personal income tax return for the nonresident portion of\nthe year, B was required to include the $2,000 rent from the New York State\nreal estate actually received during this period. On his New York State\npersonal income tax return for the resident portion of the year, he was\nrequired to include the balance of the rent ($4,000) received after his change\nof residence but nothing was required to be included on account of the amount\nreceived for his services in California or the related travel expenses\nincurred, which were accrued as of his change of residence. (g) When an individual changes his resident\nstatus during the taxable year, he must complete schedule form IT-360 and\nattach it to the New York State personal income tax returns required to be\nfiled under this Part. When a trust changes its resident status during the\ntaxable year, a statement must be attached to the New York State fiduciary\nreturns required under this Part showing the computation of Federal taxable\nincome of such trust for the entire taxable year and the computation of its New\n\nYork taxable income for the respective periods of residence and nonresidence\ncovered by the New York State fiduciary returns.
