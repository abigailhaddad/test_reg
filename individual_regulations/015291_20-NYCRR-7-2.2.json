  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 7-2.2 - Amendments of declaration\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 213-a(d))\n\nIn making a declaration of estimated tax, the taxpayer is\nrequired to take into account the facts and circumstances existing at the time, as well as those reasonably to be anticipated, that relate to the prospective\narticle 9-A tax. Amended or revised declarations may be made if the taxpayer\nfinds that its estimated tax differs from the estimated tax reflected in its\nmost recent declarations of estimated tax. However, an amended declaration may\nonly be made on an installment date (see section\n7-3.4\nof this Part Other\ninstallments of estimated tax) and no further amendment may be made until a\nsucceeding installment date. The amended declaration must be made on form\nCT-400 and marked \"AMENDED\". No refund will be issued as a result of the filing\nof an amended declaration. Consideration will be given to a refund only in\nconnection with a completed report filed by a taxpayer for the taxable year\ncovered by its declaration (and amended declaration). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n7-2.2\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
