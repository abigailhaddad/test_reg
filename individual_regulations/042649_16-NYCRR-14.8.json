(1)\nA utility must not\nterminate service to a two-family dwelling unless it fulfills all requirements\nof this section and provides written notice to: (i) the owner of the premises or the party to\nwhom the last preceding bill was rendered; and\n(ii)\nthe occupants of each unit. (2)\n\nThe notice required by this\nsubdivision must state: (i) the earliest date\ntermination may occur; (ii)\nthe\nreasons for termination, including the total amount required to be paid, and\nhow termination may be avoided; (iii)\nthat there are special protections for\noccupants of two-family dwellings where service is not billed\nseparately; (iv)\nthat occupants may\nbe authorized to set off utility payments against their rents in these\ncircumstances, in accordance with the New York State Real Property\n\nLaw; (v) that utility procedures\nare available for considering complaints before termination, including the\naddress and telephone number of the appropriate utility office; and\n(vi)\nthat commission procedures are available\nfor assistance, including the address and telephone number of the appropriate\ncommission office.

(4)\n\nThe utility must give 15 calendar days\nnotice if personally served or posted, and 18 calendar days notice if\nmailed. (5)\n\nWhenever a notice of\ntermination of service has been made in accordance with this subdivision and\nthe utility no longer intends to terminate service, the utility must so notify\nthe occupants in the same manner as it gave the original notice. (c) Procedures to avoid\ntermination of service. (1)\nA utility\nfollowing the requirements of this section may require the occupants in a\ntwo-family dwelling to pay no more than the current charges incurred by the\nparty to whom the last preceeding bill was rendered, and must not terminate\nservice if such current charges are paid. (2)\n\nAn occupant may either: (i) apply for service and be accepted as a\ncustomer, if eligible to do so under section\n14.3\nof this Part, in which case\nsuch person will be liable for future payments; or\n(ii)\nchoose to pay current charges only, in\nwhich case such person will not be liable for future payments and future bills\nmust continue to be rendered to the customer with a copy sent to any occupant\nupon request. (d) Physical termination of service. Paragraphs (c)(3) through (c)(6) and subdivisions (d) through (f) of section\n14.4\nof this Part are applicable\nto the termination of service to two-family dwellings.
