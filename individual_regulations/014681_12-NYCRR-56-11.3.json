Air sampling and analysis on a minor asbestos project or minor\nsize regulated abatement work area conducted under this section shall be\nconducted in accordance with the requirements of Subpart 56-4 of this\n\nPart. (b) Where allowed. For\nasbestos projects or regulated abatement work areas with abatement of less than\nor equal to 10 square feet or 25 linear feet of ACM, PACM or asbestos material, Phase II minor asbestos project abatement procedures as per this section may be\ncomplied with in lieu of full compliance with Subparts 56-7 through 56-9 of\nthis Part. All other requirements of this Part shall apply. Minor asbestos\nproject corrective actions shall include limited enclosure, spot\nrepair/patching, incidental disturbance clean-up, spot removal, and spot\nencapsulation. All corrective actions except spot removal shall be performed\nusing non-asbestos material. Repairs where spot removal has occurred shall also\nutilize non-asbestos material. The regulated abatement work area shall be\nestablished as per the requirements of section\n56-7.4\nof this Part. (c) Ventilation for power tools. Power tools\nused to drill, cut, or otherwise disturb asbestos material in minor size\nregulated abatement work areas, shall be manufacturer equipped with\nHEPA-filtered local exhaust ventilation. (d) Glovebag use. Glovebag operations shall\nbe performed within negative pressure tent enclosures, and shall utilize\ncommercially available glovebags of at least six mil, transparent plastic and\nno larger than needed. See section\n56-7.11\nof this Part regarding\ntent construction and section\n56-8.4\nof this Part regarding\nproper glovebag procedures. For an isolated event necessary for repair\nassociated with normal operations and maintenance activities, a single glovebag\noperation may be performed without a negative pressure tent\nenclosure. (e) Tent use. Tents may\nbe used to perform minor size asbestos abatement, with or without the use of\nglovebags. Commercially available tents with floors, walls and ceilings of at\nleast one layer six mil, fire-retardant plastic or a constructed tent per\nsection\n56-7.11\n(f)(1)\nof\nthis Part may be used. When utilizing a tent for minor size asbestos projects, the following shall be required: (1)\n\nPersonal/equipment decontamination room or area. An existing room or area that\nis adjacent to the regulated abatement work area shall be used for the\ndecontamination of personnel and equipment. The room or area shall be covered\nby an impermeable dropcloth on the floor or horizontal working surface. The\nroom or area must be of sufficient size to accommodate cleaning of equipment\nand removing personal protective equipment. Work clothing must be cleaned with\na HEPA vacuum before it is removed. All equipment and surfaces of asbestos\nwaste bags/containers must be cleaned prior to removing them from the\ndecontamination room or area. All personnel must enter and exit the regulated\nabatement work area through the decontamination room or area. (2)\n\nPersonal protective equipment. All\npersons shall don appropriate personal protective equipment before entering the\ntent in compliance with current OSHA regulations. Authorized visitors entering\nthe tent shall also don NIOSH-approved respiratory protection. (3)\n\nExhausting the tent. A HEPA-vacuum or\nother negative pressure HEPA-filtered ventilation equipment shall be used to\ncontinuously exhaust the tent in accordance with sections\n56-7.8\n(a) and\n56-7.11\n(f)(1)\nof\nthis Part. (4)\n\nAmended water. All\nmaterial to be removed shall be saturated with amended water as specified in\nthis Part. (5)\n\nAbatement\nprocedures.

Cleanup shall be accomplished as follows: (i) Method. All accumulations of asbestos waste material shall be containerized and\nremoved. HEPA-vacuums shall be used to clean all surfaces after gross\ncleanup. (ii)\n\nRemoval of\ncontaminated equipment and waste. Contaminated equipment and all containerized\nwaste shall be removed from the regulated abatement work area. (iii)\n\nCleanup of surfaces. All surfaces in\nthe regulated abatement work area shall be wet- cleaned using rags, mops or\nsponges. (iv)\n\nWaiting period. Negative pressure HEPA-ventilated air equipment shall be operated for a minimum\nof 20 minutes following completion of final wet cleaning. (8)\n\nVisual inspection. Once final cleaning is\ncomplete, a visual inspection shall be completed by the supervisor to confirm\nthat the scope of abatement work for the asbestos project is complete, and no\nvisible debris/residue, pools of liquid, or condensation remain. (9)\n\nRemoval of personal protective equipment. The worker's disposable protective clothing shall be removed and left in the\ntent upon exiting. (10)\n\nExiting\nprocedures. After exiting the tent, workers shall immediately don clean\nprotective clothing. Workers shall then seal the tent exit and, upon tent\ncollapse, shut down the HEPA-vacuum. (11)\n\nCollapsing and containerizing the tent. The plastic sheeting which formed the tent, and the contents thereof, shall be\nfully collapsed, starting from the top and working downward. The tent and\ncontents shall be placed in at least a six mil plastic bag or hardwall\ncontainer, sealed airtight with duct tape and removed for disposal. (12)\n\nShowering.
