  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 112.11 - Modifications relating to property acquired from the estate of a decedent\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 612(r)\n(a) General. A modification may be required under section\n612 (b)(17)\nor\n612 (c)(19)\nof the Tax Law (see section\n112.2\n[n]\nor\n112.3\n[o]\nof this Part) when property acquired from a decedent and valued by the executor\nof the estate is either sold or disposed of and a gain or loss is\nrealized. (b) Where a\n\nFederal estate tax return is not required to be filed, the Federal gain or\nloss, based on the value of the property sold or disposed of as of the date of\nthe decedent's death, will be reflected in Federal adjusted gross income. Where\nsuch property was valued under the alternate valuation method for New York\n\nState purposes, the New York State gain or loss realized will be based on the\nvalue of the property as of the alternate valuation date or dates. This may\nresult in a different gain or loss for Federal and New York State tax purposes\nand such difference becomes the modification required under section\n612 (b)(17)\nor\n612 (c)(19)\nof the Tax Law (see section\n112.2\n[n]\nor\n112.3\n[o]\nof this Part). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n112.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
