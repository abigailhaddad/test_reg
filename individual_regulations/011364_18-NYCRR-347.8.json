The social\nservices district's representative also must ensure that any support payments\nare payable to the support collection unit. 6. If the court or administrative authority\ndismisses a petition to establish, modify, or enforce a support order without\nprejudice, the child support enforcement unit must, at the time of the\ndismissal, examine the reasons for dismissal and determine when, in the future, it would be appropriate to petition for an order of support, and, at that time, again file a petition for such order.
