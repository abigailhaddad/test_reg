(1)\n\nAny person who submits information to the\ndepartment, which is not otherwise exempted from disclosure under the laws of\nthe State of New York or the United States, may request that the department\nexcept such information from disclosure as critical infrastructure information\nor a trade secret pursuant to sections\n86\n(5), 87\n(2)\nand\n89\n(5)\nof the Public Officers Law.

(c) A denial of an exception from disclosure\nunder subdivision (b) of this section may be appealed by the person submitting\nthe information, and a denial of access to the record may be appealed by the\nperson requesting the record in accordance with the procedure outlined in\nsection\n80.7\nof this Part.
