  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 229.10 - Hydrogen sulfide\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Allowable\nconcentration. The gas distributed by each company shall contain no quantity of\nhydrogen sulfide greater than that permitted by subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (b) Equipment and testing\nprocedure. (1)\n\nEach company shall provide each\nof its testing stations required by section\n229.50\nof this Part with equipment\nfor the qualitative determination of the hydrogen sulfide content of gas fully\ncomplying with the provisions of this Part. In each instance of evidence of or\ndoubt or difference of opinion regarding the presence of hydrogen sulfide in\nthe distributed gas, or where directed by this commission, the company shall\nprovide said testing stations with equipment for the quantitative determination\nof the hydrogen sulfide content of gas fully complying and maintained in full\ncompliance with the provisions of paragraphs 65 through 87 of the relevant\neffective code of the American Petroleum Institute, the presently effective\ncode being entitled \"Recommended Practice for Measuring, Sampling, and Testing\n\nNatural Gas (RP 50 A, Third Edition)\" (the presently effective code hereinafter\nreferred to as APIRP 50 A). (2)\n\nEach company shall make all of the determinations of the hydrogen sulfide\ncontent of the distributed gas required by subdivision (c) of this section in\nfull compliance with the following procedure and record the results thereof: A strip of white filter paper moistened with a fresh\nsolution containing five percent by weight of lead acetate shall be exposed to\nthe distributed gas for one minute in a previously purged apparatus, fully\ncomplying and maintained in full compliance with the form recommended therefor\nby the second edition of Circular 48 of the National Bureau of Standards\nentitled \"Standard Methods of Gas Testing\" (hereinafter referred to as NBS C\n48), through which the gas flows at a rate of approximately five cubic feet per\nhour. The gas shall not directly impinge upon the test strip during the test. At the end of the stated time, the test strip thus exposed shall be compared\nwith a second test strip similarly prepared but not exposed to the gas. If the\nexposed strip is ascertained to be not noticeably darker than the comparison\nstrip, the gas shall be considered to be free of hydrogen sulfide. If the\nexposed strip is ascertained to be noticeably darker than the comparison strip\nor if there is any doubt or difference of opinion regarding the color of the\nexposed strip, the gas shall be quantitatively tested for hydrogen sulfide in\nfull compliance with the provisions of API RP 50 A. (c) Required tests. Each company\nshall make and record the results of one daily test of the hydrogen sulfide\ncontent of the distributed gas on each of not less than five days per calendar\nweek at each of its testing stations required by subdivisions (a) through (d)\nof section\n229.50\nof this Part, except that, where there is evidence of the presence of hydrogen sulfide in said gas, three\nsuch tests shall be made daily at intervals of not less than three hours until\nsaid tests indicate the continued absence of hydrogen sulfide in the gas for a\nperiod of at least one week. At a testing station testing distributed gas\nobtained from a company's standby source, said company need not make a test of\nthe hydrogen sulfide content of said gas during any day that the gas is\nobtained from said standby source for a total of less than one hour. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n229.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
