  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 160.5 - Prohibition of informal discussion of rate changes\n\nState Regulations\n\nSince both the overall policy and specific provisions of the new law provide for a system under which there is to be no prior review of rates or rate changes, it is essential, in order to preclude later question about the legality of rate on purely procedural grounds, that there be no such prior review. Accordingly, department and industry personnel shall not discuss contemplated rates or rate changes in advance of their taking effect. The only exception would be in situations where the consideration of novel questions of law, policy or statistical method is involved and then only if an insurer or rating organization has made a written request to the superintendent for prior consultation and the request has been granted in writing by the superintendent. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n160.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
