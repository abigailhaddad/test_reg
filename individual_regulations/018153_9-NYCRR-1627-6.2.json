This\nnotice shall include reason(s) for vacating.

(c) Possession of\napartments abandoned by tenants may be recovered by the authority without legal\nproceedings. However, if tenant has left any possessions or if there is any\ndoubt as to whether the apartment has actually been abandoned, the authority's\ncounsel shall be contacted for advice as to what action should be taken to gain\npossession.
