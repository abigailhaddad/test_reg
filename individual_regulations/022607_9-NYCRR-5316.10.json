Rejected bills, vouchers, coupons or other approved\nnotes shall be returned to the patron. The bill-input system shall be\nconstructed in a manner that protects against vandalism, abuse or fraudulent\nactivity. A bill-acceptance device shall comply with the following: (1)\neach valid bill, coupon, voucher or other\napproved note shall register the actual monetary value or the appropriate\nnumber of credits received on the kiosk; and\n(2)\na credit meter shall update upon bill\ninsertion. Cash shall be dispensed only when: (i) the bill or other note has passed the\npoint where such bill or note is accepted and stacked; and\n(ii)\nthe validator has sent the \"irrevocable\nstacked\" message to the kiosk. (b) Communications. All bill validators shall\ncommunicate with the kiosk using a bidirectional protocol. (c) Factory set bill validators. If bill\nvalidators are designed to be factory-set only, it shall not be possible to\naccess or conduct maintenance or adjustments to such bill validators in the\nfield, other than: (1)\nselecting desired\nacceptance for bills, coupons, vouchers or other approved notes and their\nlimits; (2)\nchanging certified\ncontrol program media or downloading certified software; (3)\nmaintaining, adjusting and repairing per\napproved factory procedures; or\n(4)\nimplementing options that set the direction or orientation of acceptance.
