  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 204.8 - Pathogen and vector attraction reduction; testing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pathogen reduction. Natural organic reduction facilities must use one of the methods (and, where\napplicable, achieve the results) specified in this subdivision to reduce\npathogen content before the naturally organically reduced remains leave the\nfacility: (1)\nmaintain the temperature of the\nremains at 55° C or higher for at least 72 consecutive hours; or\n(2)\nother methods or operating conditions as\nmay be approved by the division if the division determines that pathogens are\nreduced to an extent equivalent to the reduction achieved by a method/result\nspecified in this subdivision. (b) Vector attraction\nreduction. One of the vector attraction reduction methods or results\nspecified in this subdivision must be used or achieved before the naturally\norganically reduced remains leave the natural organic reduction facility. Such\na vector attraction reduction result must be achieved either after meeting the\npathogen reduction requirements or at the same time as meeting the pathogen\nreduction requirements: (1)\ntreat the remains\nby an aerobic process for a minimum of 14 days. Throughout such treatment time, the temperature of the remains must remain higher than 40° C and the\naverage temperature of the remains must be higher than 45° C; or\n(2)\nother methods or operating conditions as\nmay be approved by the division if the division determines that vector\nattraction is reduced to an extent equivalent to the reduction achieved by a\nmethod/result specified in this subdivision. (c) Pathogen Testing. Prior\nto removal of the naturally organically reduced remains from the natural\norganic reduction facility, either the density of fecal coliform in the\nnaturally organically reduced remains shall be less than 1,000 most probable\nnumber per gram of total solids (dry weight basis) or the density of salmonella\nsp. bacteria in the product must be less than 3 most probable number per 4\ngrams of total solids (dry weight basis). This analysis must be performed by a\ncertified laboratory. (d) Failure of Pathogen Testing. If, after completion of the\npathogen or vector attraction reduction methods described in subdivisions (a)\nand (b) of this section, a laboratory determines the naturally organically\nreduced remains do not meet the specified standards for pathogens in\nsubdivision (c) of this section, then the natural organic reduction facility\nshall repeat a pathogen and vector reduction method described in this section, and have the naturally organically reduced remains retested for pathogens in\naccordance with subdivision (c) of this section. (e) Pollutant Testing. Prior\nto removal of the naturally organically reduced remains from the natural\norganic reduction facility, the naturally organically reduced remains shall be\ntested for pollutants. This analysis must be performed by a certified\nlaboratory. Naturally organically reduced remains shall not contain pollutants\nthat exceed the following thresholds, per maximum concentration mg/kg, dry\nweight: (1)\n\nArsenic (As) 41\n(2)\n\nCadmium (Cd) 10\n(3)\n\nChromium (Cr-total) 1,000\n(4)\n\nCopper (Cu) 1,500\n(5)\n\nLead (Pb) 300\n(6)\n\nMercury (Hg) 10\n(7)\n\nMolybdenum (Mo) 40\n(8)\n\nNickel (Ni) 200\n(9)\n\nSelenium (Se) 100\n(10)\n\nZinc (Zn) 2,500\n(f) Failure of Pollutant\n\nTesting. If a certified laboratory determines the naturally\norganically reduced remains exceed any of the pollutant thresholds set forth in\nsubdivision (e) of this section, then the natural organic reduction facility\nshall repeat the natural organic reduction process with additional bulking\nagents sufficient to reduce the concentration of pollutants to acceptable\nlevels. Upon completion of the natural organic reduction process, the natural\norganic reduction facility shall have a certified laboratory retest the\nnaturally organically reduced remains for pollutants in accordance with\nsubdivision (e) of this section. (g) Repeated Failures of Pathogen or\n\nPollutant Testing. (1)\n\nIf the\nnaturally organically reduced remains have failed the pathogen testing\nrequirements of subdivision (c) of this section, the natural organic reduction\nfacility followed the procedures of subdivision (d) of this section and, upon\nretesting by a certified laboratory the naturally organically reduced remains\nagain failed the pathogen testing requirements, the natural organic reduction\nfacility shall: (i) promptly notify the\ndivision and provide the division with the certified laboratory test results, its analysis of why the naturally organically reduced remains failed the\npathogen testing requirements, and, if necessary, proposed adjustments to its\noperating procedures to mitigate future failures; (ii)\npromptly notify the person in control of\ndisposition; and\n(iii)\nfollow the\nprocedure provided in its plan of operations under section\n204.3\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nIf the\nnaturally organically reduced remains have failed the pollutant testing\nrequirements of subdivision (e) of this section and the natural organic\nreduction facility followed the procedures of subdivision (f) of this section\nand, upon retesting by a certified laboratory the naturally organically reduced\nremains again failed the pollutant testing requirements, the natural organic\nreduction facility shall: (i) promptly notify\nthe division and provide the division with the laboratory test results, its\nanalysis of why the naturally organically reduced remains failed the pollutant\ntesting requirements, and, if necessary, proposed adjustments to its operating\nprocedures to mitigate future failures; (ii)\npromptly notify the person in control of\ndisposition; and\n(iii)\nfollow the\nprocedure provided in its plan of operations under section\n204.3\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nThe natural\norganic reduction facility shall not impose additional charges for having to\nrepeat methods or testing described in this section or having to perform\nadditional methods or testing in order to comply with this section. (h) Original copies of all\nlaboratory testing results obtained pursuant to this section and documentation\nof all pathogen reduction and vector attraction results achieved pursuant to\nthis section must be retained by the natural organic reduction facility and\npromptly provided to the person in control of disposition.
