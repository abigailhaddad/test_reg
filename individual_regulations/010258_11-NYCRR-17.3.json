  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 17.3 - Additional information\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe establishment of any standard claim form by the superintendent shall not preclude a commercial insurer or an article IX-C corporation from obtaining any necessary additional information regarding a claim from the claimant, provider of health care or treatment, or certifier of coverage. Recognizing that unlimited requests for additional information by a commercial insurer or an article IX-C corporation may negate the benefits to be gained by a standard claim form, \"necessary additional information\" should be requested only when a claim cannot be resolved without obtaining such information or certification of coverage is needed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n17.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
