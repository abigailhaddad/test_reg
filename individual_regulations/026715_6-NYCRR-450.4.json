(2)\n\nVariations resulting\nfrom commercial instrument tolerances. (3)\n\nVariations resulting from the topography\nof the noise measurement site. (4)\n\nVariations resulting from atmospheric conditions such as wind, ambient\ntemperature and atmospheric pressure. (5)\n\nVariations resulting from reflected sound\nfrom small objects allowed within the test site. (6)\n\nThe interpretation of the effects of the\nabove-cited factors by enforcement personnel. (b) Measurement tolerances shall not exceed\ntwo decibels for a given measurement. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
