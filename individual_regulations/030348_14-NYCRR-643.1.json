  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 643.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Federal\n\nBrady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 (Brady Act), as amended, among\nother provisions, prohibits any person from selling or otherwise disposing of\nany firearm or ammunition to any person who has been involuntarily \"committed\nto a mental institution\" (18 U.S.C. section\n922\n[d][4]) and further prohibits any person\nwho has been involuntarily \"committed to a mental institution\" from shipping or\ntransporting in interstate or foreign commerce, or possessing in or affecting\ncommerce, any firearm or ammunition; or receiving any firearm or ammunition\nwhich has been shipped or transported in interstate or foreign commerce\n(18 U.S.C. section\n922\n[g][4]). (b) Under the Federal NICS Improvement\n\nAmendments Act of 2007, Public Law\n110-180, section 105, the Brady Act\n(18 U.S.C. section\n922\net seq. ) was amended to\nmandate that states must report certain persons disqualified from receiving or\npossessing firearms to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System\n(NICS). Upon being contacted by a Federal firearm licensee prior to\ntransferring a firearm to an unlicensed person, NICS will provide information\non whether a person is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm under\n\nState or Federal law. NICS contains records concerning certain events, such as\ncriminal convictions and mental health adjudications and findings that may\ndisqualify a person from purchasing a firearm. The 2007 amendments also require\nthe establishment of a \"certificate of relief from disabilities\" process on\nboth the Federal and State levels to permit a person who has been or may be\ndisqualified from possessing a firearm pursuant to\n18\nU.S.C. section\n922(d)(4) and\n(g)(4)\nto petition for relief from that\ndisability. (c) Section 13.09(f) of\nthe Mental Hygiene Law authorizes the Office for People With Developmental\n\nDisabilities (OPWDD), in cooperation with the NYS Unified Court System and\nother State agencies, to collect, retain, modify or transmit data or records\nfor inclusion in NICS for the purpose of responding to NICS queries regarding\nattempts to purchase or otherwise take possession of firearms, as defined in\n18\nU.S.C. 921(a)(3). The\nrecords which OPWDD is authorized by law to collect, retain, modify, or\ntransmit, include information identifying persons who have been involuntarily\ncommitted to an OPWDD facility pursuant to article 15 of the Mental Hygiene\n\nLaw, article 730 or section\n330.20\nof the Criminal Procedure Law, or\nsection\n322.2\nor\n353.4\nof the\n\nFamily Court Act. In accordance with the above-referenced Federal law, Mental\n\nHygiene Law, section\n13.09\n(f) also requires OPWDD to promulgate\nregulations establishing a \"certificate of relief from disabilities\" process\nfor those persons whose records were provided to the Division of Criminal\n\nJustice Services or the Federal Bureau of Investigation by OPWDD pursuant to\n\nMental Hygiene Law, section 13.09(f), and who have been or may be disqualified\nfrom purchasing and/or possessing a firearm pursuant to\n18\nU.S.C. section\n922(d)(4) and\n(g)(4). (d) The purpose of these regulations is to\nestablish the required administrative \"certificate of relief from disabilities\"\nprocess for persons whose records were submitted to NICS by OPWDD in accordance\nwith section 13.09(f) of the Mental Hygiene Law. Such relief will be based on a\ndetermination of whether the person's record and reputation are such that\nhe/she will not be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety and\nwhere granting the relief would not be contrary to the public\ninterest.
