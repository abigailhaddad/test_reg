  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 441.231 - Organization cost (or expense)\n\nState Regulations\n\nAny cost incurred in establishing a corporation or other\nform of organization; as, incorporation, legal and accounting fees, promotional\ncosts incident to the sale of securities, security qualification expense, and\nprinting of stock certificates. These and similar costs constitute, theoretically, an intangible asset of value which continues throughout the life\nof the corporation and hence, strictly, do not constitute a deferred charge. The organization costs must be amortized over a period of time not less than 60\nmonths. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n441.231\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
