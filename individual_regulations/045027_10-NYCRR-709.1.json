For the purpose of determining the\nextent to which the proposed service or facility will be accessible to such\npersons, following shall be considered: (i) the extent to which medically underserved populations currently use the\napplicant's services in comparison to the percentage of the population in the\napplicant's service area which is medically underserved, and the extent to\nwhich medically underserved populations are expected to use the proposed\nservices if approved; (ii)\nthe\nperformance of the applicant in meeting its obligation under the applicable\ncivil rights statutes prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, color, national origin, handicap, sex and age; (iii)\nthe extent to which Medicare, Medicaid\nand medically indigent patients are served by the applicant; and\n(iv)\nthe extent to which the applicant offers\na range of means by which a person will have access to its services.

(c) The\npublic need analysis for each proposal will include a determination of the\nappropriate service area. The county in which the construction is proposed\nshall be the service area, unless the commissioner, upon consideration of the\nadvice of the State Hospital Review and Planning Council, determines that a\nservice area other than the county is more appropriate. The applicant or the\nhealth systems agency may delineate a service area other than the county\ntogether with evidence in support of such delineation. After reviewing the\nevidence, the commissioner, upon consideration of the advice of the council, may determine that the proposed service area is not acceptable. In cases\nwherein a service area other than the county is being proposed, the following\nshall be considered: (1)\nthe patterns of\nin-and-out migration for specific services which are the same as those proposed\nby the applicant and patient preference or origin; and\n(2)\nappropriateness of travel and referral\npatterns. (d) Medical\nfacilities shall be planned to achieve efficiency and economy of operation and\ncare of high quality. In addition to the other pertinent provisions of this\n\nPart, the analysis to determine whether there is a public need for the proposed\nconstruction shall include consideration of additional factors as appropriate, including but not limited to the following: (1)\nthe condition of the facility's existing\nstructures and equipment and the extent to which they are in compliance with\nthe applicable standards of facility operation and construction under this\n\nTitle; (2)\nwhether the\narchitectural solutions proposed by the applicant to address the issues which\nare the subject of the application are: (i) cost efficient with respect to the anticipated operational and capital cost\nimpact of the proposal; (ii)\nnecessary to correct nonwaiverable requirements or standards of operation or\nconstruction under this Title; (iii)\nnecessary to address a problem or\nsituation which will require corrective action within two years; (3)\n[Reserved]\n(4)\nwhether the proposal is consistent with\nthe applicant's long-range capital plan; (5)\nwhether the applicant will take advantage\nof opportunities for the efficient and economic reuse and recycling of existing\nphysical plant resources, where feasible and appropriate; (6)\nthe life cycle incremental operational\nand capital cost effectiveness and efficiency of the proposal; (7)\nwhether the proposal could be adapted to\naccommodate changes in pertinent technology; (8)\nwhether the applicant will take advantage\nof opportunities to gain economies and improvements in the provision of\nservices by entering into appropriate arrangements for sharing facilities, services or equipment with other facilities; and\n(9)\nwhether there are alternative methods or\nsolutions available, which are more efficient, based on capital and operating\ncosts, to address the subject problem or situation that will nevertheless\nensure the provision of a level and quality of care and service that is in\ncompliance with pertinent Federal and State statutes, rules and\nregulations. (e) Any\napplication for construction wherein a determination of public need is made\npursuant to this section shall be subject to the following: (1)\n\nThe commissioner may, during the\nprocessing of an application, propose to disapprove the application solely on\nthe basis of a determination of public need in advance of his consideration of\nthe questions of the adequacy of financial resources, sources of future revenue\nand the character and competence of the applicant without, however, waiving his\nright to consider such criteria at a later date. (2)\n\nIn the event the commissioner upon the\nrecommendation of the State Hospital Review and Planning Council proposes to\ndisapprove an application solely on the basis of a lack of public need and the\napplicant then requests a hearing, the commissioner may direct the completion\nof the other required by Public Health Law, section 2802, the results of which\nshall be presented to the State Hospital Review and Planning Council for\nrecommendations, which reviews may then be included as grounds for the proposed\ndisapproval to be considered at the hearing. If the commissioner directs the\ncompletion of such reviews, a copy of the report containing the results of the\nreviews shall be mailed to the applicant at least 60 days prior to the date set\nfor hearing. (3)\n\nIn the event the\ncommissioner proposes to disapprove an application solely on the basis of no\npublic need and the State Hospital Review and Planning Council does not concur\nwith such proposed disapproval, the application shall be returned to the\ndepartment without a formal recommendation. The commissioner shall then direct\nthe completion of the other reviews required by Public Health Law, section\n2802, and shall return the application to the State Hospital Review and\n\nPlanning Council for its formal recommendation.
