  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-1.5 - Apportionment on combined report\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-C(5))\n\nThe apportionment factor on a combined report is\ncomputed as though the corporations included in the combined report are a\nsingle corporation, unless otherwise provided, and is computed in accordance\nwith the following principles. (a) All\nintercorporate business receipts, income, gains and losses are eliminated in\ncomputing the combined group's New York receipts or everywhere receipts. Intercorporate receipts, income, gains and losses are receipts, income, gains\nand losses realized by any corporation included in the combined report from a\ntransaction with any other corporation included in the combined\nreport. (b) Net gains (not less\nthan zero), marked to market net gains (not less than zero), net interest\nincome (not less than zero), and net income (not less than zero) from any\nrespective type of asset on a combined report are computed as follows: (1)\n\nFor purposes of computing net gains (not\nless than zero) for all members of the combined group, the aggregate gain from\nthe sale of one type of asset is reduced by the aggregate loss from the sale of\nthe same type of asset subject to the same sourcing rule in section 210-A and\nthis Subchapter, provided that the result cannot be less than zero. (2)\n\nFor purposes of computing net interest\nincome (not less than zero) from Federal funds for all members of the combined\ngroup, the aggregate amount of interest income from Federal funds is reduced by\nthe aggregate amount of interest expense from Federal funds, provided the\nresult cannot be less than zero. (c) If an apportionment rule contained in\nsection 210-A and this Subchapter requires the use of a fraction to compute the\namount included in the combined group's New York receipts, the amount included\nin the numerator or denominator of such fraction is determined after the\nintercorporate eliminations required by subdivision (a) of this\nsection. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n4-1.5\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
