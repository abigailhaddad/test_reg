  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 56.0 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection\n52.16\n(c)(5)\nof this Title (Insurance Regulation No. 62), permits insurers and health maintenance organizations (HMOs) that are required to provide coverage for surgical services, to exclude coverage of cosmetic surgery. Part 52 of this Title does not define cosmetic surgery, but does provide examples of two types of reconstructive surgeries that may never be considered cosmetic. Subsequent to the promulgation of Part 52 of this Title, titles I and II of article 49 of the Insurance Law and Public Health Law were enacted that require medical necessity denials to be subject to utilization review and external appeal. The Department of Financial Services has found inconsistencies among insurers and HMOs as to when denials of surgery are considered medical necessity denials and subject to utilization review and external appeal. Section\n56.3\nof this Part and an amended section\n52.16\n(c)(5)\nof this Title clarify that, whenever surgery is a covered benefit under certain policies, a determination that the surgery is cosmetic is a medical necessity determination subject to the utilization review and external review requirements of titles I and II of article 49 of the Insurance Law and Public Health Law, except in certain cases when the claim or request for surgery is identified by one of the codes in section\n56.3\n(f) of this Part and is submitted without medical information. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n56.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
