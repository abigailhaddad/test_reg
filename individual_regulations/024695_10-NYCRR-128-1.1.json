  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 128-1.1 - Preface\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The health, welfare and economic well-being of nearly nine million residents in the five counties of New York City (\"the city\"), and of an increasing number of upstate New York communities is inextricably tied to the quality of the source waters in the watersheds of the New York City Water Supply located in Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Delaware, Ulster, Greene, Sullivan and Schoharie Counties, and Fairfield County in Connecticut. The high quality of these waters faces a continuing threat from the cumulative and episodic impacts of pollution sources generated by certain land uses and activities in the watersheds. It is the duty of the Commissioner of the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (the \"department\") and the New York State Department of Health to protect the high quality of waters from which the city's water supply is drawn and preserve it from degradation for the purpose of protecting the health and general welfare of its consumers. (b) These rules and regulations repeal in their entirety and supersede the rules and regulations for the Department of Water Supply, Gas and Electricity of the City of New York enacted the 11th day of June, 1953. (c) These rules and regulations are hereby enacted pursuant to the authority vested in the New York State Department of Health and the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection, as set forth in section\n128-1.3\nof this Subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n128-1.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
