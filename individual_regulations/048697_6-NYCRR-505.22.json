  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 505.22 - Remapping revisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pursuant to section 34-0104(4) of the\nact, the commissioner must review the boundaries of each erosion hazard area 10\nyears from the date of its final identification and each 10 years\nthereafter. (b) Pursuant to section\n34-0104(4) of the act, the commissioner must also review the boundaries of\nerosion hazard areas after the occurrence of a major man-made or natural event\nor a major coastal storm. Coastal erosion hazard area maps will be revised if\ntopographical changes or addition or loss of structural protection justify\nadjustment of the erosion hazard area boundary by 25 feet or more. Revised\ncoastal erosion hazard area maps may not take effect until at least 12 months\nhave elapsed from the occurrence of such event or such storm. (c) In structural hazard areas, if shoreline\nrecession has occurred at a rate sufficient to cause the receding edge to come\nwithin 25 feet of the erosion hazard area boundary in less than eight years\nfrom the most recent date of final identification of the erosion hazard area, a\nnew recession rate analysis will be performed and the coastal erosion hazard\narea map will be revised accordingly without the 12-month delay specified in\nsubdivision (b) of this section. (d) In all cases of remapping revisions\ndescribed in this section, the department must follow the procedures set forth\nin section 34-0104(2)-(4) of the act. The landowner notification process will\nbe limited to only the owners of those properties affected by the proposed\nchanges in the erosion hazard area by being added to or removed from the\nerosion hazard area or by a shift in the erosion hazard area boundary on a\npreviously identified property. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n505.22\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
