  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 86.4 - General provisions relating to the conversion (other than a conversion effected pursuant to any contrary provisions of section 86.12 of this part) of a t\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThe board of trustees or the board of\ndirectors, as the case may be, of a thrift may determine to convert the\ninstitution to stock-form of ownership, and to seek the superintendent's\napproval therefor, by first securing the approval of its plan of conversion by\na majority of the entire board of such trustees or directors, at a meeting duly\nheld upon not less than 15 days' notice (or upon such shorter notice, or\nwithout notice, provided all the members of such board waive in writing such\n15-day notice period), said notice to contain a copy of the plan of conversion\nproposed to be filed with the superintendent. (2)\n\nFollowing the approval of the plan of\nconversion by the board of trustees or directors, the converting institution\nshall promptly provide public notice of its plan to convert to stock form. Such\npublic notice shall be made by means of the posting of a notice in a\nconspicuous place in the principal and branch offices (which term shall not\ninclude separate electronic facilities) of the institution, the issuance of a\npress release containing all material details of the proposed conversion (and\nsuch other information required to make the press release not false or\nmisleading) and the placing of an advertisement containing such material\ndetails (and such other information, if any) in a newspaper of general\ncirculation in the communities where the principal offices and branches of the\nconverting institution are located. Thereafter, such institution shall file\nwith the superintendent for approval an application for conversion containing\nall of the information required by section\n86.13\nof this Part. The\nsuperintendent's approval or disapproval shall be given within 60 days after\nthe superintendent shall have acknowledged to the applicant that the contents\nof the application and the required documents and exhibits are substantially\ncomplete and acceptable in the form submitted. (3)\n\nIf approved, such institution shall\nsubmit the plan of conversion to its eligible account holders, for approval at\na meeting held upon written notice given no less than 20 days nor more than 45\ndays prior to the date of such meeting. Separate notices shall be sent to joint\naccount holders at each address appearing on the records of the institution as\nthe address of a joint account holder, except that only one notice need be sent\nto joint account holders residing at the same address. Such notice shall be\nsent by first class mail postage prepaid and shall consist of a notice of\nmeeting and shall be accompanied by a proxy card and either a proxy statement\nor a short-form proxy statement, each to comply with the provisions of section\n86.14\nof this Part. The proxy card: shall indicate in boldface type whether the proxy is solicited on behalf of the\nmanagement; shall provide specifically designated blank spaces for dating and\nsigning such proxy card; shall identify clearly and impartially each matter or\ngroup of related matters intended to be acted upon at the meeting; shall be\nclearly labeled \"revocable proxy\" in boldface type; shall describe any charter\nor other requirement restricting or conditioning voting by proxy; shall contain\nan acknowledgment by the person giving the proxy that he has received a proxy\nstatement prior to signing the form of proxy; shall contain the date, time and\nplace of meeting, if practicable; shall provide by a box or otherwise, a means\nwhereby the depositor or shareholder solicited is afforded an opportunity to\nspecify by ballot a choice between approval or disapproval of each matter\nreferred to therein as intended to be acted upon; and shall indicate in\nboldface type how the proxy shall be voted on each such matter as to which no\nchoice is so specified. Only one joint account holder must sign a proxy card\nsent in connection with a joint account, if clearly stated on the proxy card. No such proxy shall confer authority to vote at any meeting other than the\nmeeting (or any adjournment thereof) to vote on conversion. A proxy may be\ndeemed to confer authority to vote with respect to matters incident to the\nconduct of such meeting. The proxy statement or form of proxy shall provide\nthat the votes represented by the proxy will be voted; that, where the\ndepositor or shareholder solicited specifies by means of a ballot a choice with\nrespect to any matter to be acted upon, the votes will be voted in accordance\nwith the specifications so made; and that if no choice is specified, the votes\nwill be cast as indicated in boldface on the proxy card. (4)\nA vote of 75 percent in amount of deposit\nliabilities or book value of outstanding shares, as the case may be, represented in person or by proxy at such meeting shall be required for\napproval of the plan. No specific minimum amount of deposits or shares shall be\nrequired to be present either in person or by proxy at such meeting in order to\nconstitute a quorum for the transaction of business. No eligible account holder\nmay cast more than 1,000 votes at such meeting. The board of trustees or board\nof directors, as the case may be, shall appoint an independent custodian and\ntabulator to receive and hold the proxy cards and to count the votes cast in\nfavor of and in opposition to the plan of conversion. In the event provision is\nmade for the receipt of proxies at offices of the converting institution, proxies must be deposited unopened in sealed containers that are maintained and\ndelivered unopened in a sealed state to the custodian and tabulator. Such\ncustodian and tabulator shall not be affiliated with any party with an interest\nin the transaction, including any financial advisor, underwriter, appraiser, law firm or proxy solicitation firm engaged by the board of trustees or\ndirectors in connection with the conversion. (5)\nA depositor or shareholder shall be\neligible to vote if he shall have met the requirements of section\n9019\nof the\n\nBanking Law as of the eligibility record date. (6)\n\nWithin five days after the meeting of\nshareholders or depositors (which is any event shall be before the amended\norganization certificate of the converting thrift is filed pursuant to\nsubdivision [c] of this section), the president and secretary of the converting\ninstitution shall certify to the superintendent the result of the vote taken at\nsuch meeting. (b) The\napplication for conversion shall be in the form prescribed by section\n86.13\nof this Part and shall be\naccompanied by the fee specified in section\n1.2\nof Supervisory Policy G 1 of\nthis Title. (c) When the\nsuperintendent shall have determined to approve or disapprove the application\nfor conversion, he or she shall so advise the converting institution in writing\nand, in the case of a determination of approval, and after the converting\ninstitution shall have completed arrangements to sell its shares and shall have\ntaken such other steps as may be required hereunder, the superintendent, if\nsatisfied that the requirements of this Part have been met, shall endorse his\nor her approval on the amended organization certificate and shall cause it to\nbe filed in the office of the superintendent and with the clerk of the county\nin which the converting institution's principal office is located. At the time\nthe conversion from mutual to stock form becomes effective, the converting\ninstitution shall cease to be a mutual institution and shall simultaneously\nbecome a stock-form institution, and all the property of the mutual institution\nshall remain as the property of the stock-form institution. All of the rights, powers, franchises, debts, liabilities, obligations and duties of the mutual\ninstitution shall continue as such in the stock-form institution and all share\ninterests (in the case of savings and loan associations) and deposits (in the\ncase of savings banks) therein shall remain as deposits of equal value and\ncharacter of such stock-form institution. The corporate existence of the\nconverting mutual institution shall not terminate, and such converted\nstock-form institution shall be a continuation of the mutual form institution\nwhich existed immediately before the filing of the amended organization\ncertificate. (d) (1)\n\nTo the extent consistent with applicable\nlaw, a converting institution will be required to make available a list of the\nnames and addresses of all of its eligible account holders to any eligible\naccount holder requesting such list. The eligible account holder requesting\nsuch list shall be required to pay the reasonable costs incurred by the\nconverting institution in producing such list. Such list shall not contain any\ninformation regarding the amount of deposits or shares held in the accounts of\nthe eligible account holders, except that the converting institution shall be\nrequired to disclose the aggregate book value of all such deposits or shares. Such list shall be made available with reasonable promptness so as to permit\nany eligible account holder to conduct a proxy solicitation of the other\neligible account holders in advance of the meeting convened to approve the\nproposed conversion. Any eligible account holder who requests a list of\neligible account holders pursuant to this subdivision shall submit with such\nrequest a declaration concerning his or her eligibility to vote on the\nconversion and a statement indicating the purposes for which the list will be\nused and shall submit a notarized affidavit, affirmation or similar document\nattesting that the eligible account holder: (i) will not use the list for any purpose\nother than to solicit other eligible account holders with respect to the same\nsolicitation commenced by the thrift; (ii)\nwill not disclose the information\nappearing on the list to any person other than an employee or agent of such\neligible account holder to the extent necessary to effectuate the communication\nor solicitation; and\n(iii)\nwill\nreturn the list and all copies thereof in his or her possession to the\nconverting institution no later than the date of the meeting of eligible\naccount holders, as such date may be postponed or extended. (2)\n\nSubject to the receipt of the\nitems listed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the thrift shall respond to\nany bona fide request for a list of eligible account holders with reasonable\npromptness and such list shall be complete (unless the eligible account holder\nhas requested a more limited list of eligible account holders) and accurate. The list shall be in the form requested to the extent that such form is\navailable to the thrift without undue burden or expense. (3)\n\nAs an alternative to providing a list of\neligible account holders, a thrift may at its discretion mail copies of any\nproxy materials, form of proxy or other solicitation materials furnished by the\neligible account holder requesting such list to the other eligible account\nholders. If the thrift elects to mail these materials itself, it shall notify\nthe eligible account holder requesting the list of such election and provide\nsuch eligible account holder with information as to the number of other\neligible account holders, or any more limited group of eligible account holders\ndesignated by the eligible account holder requesting the list, if available\nunder the thrift's data processing systems. The thrift shall also give the\neligible account holder requesting the list the estimated cost of mailing his\nor her materials. The thrift shall mail such materials to the eligible account\nholders designated by the requesting eligible account holder with reasonable\npromptness, but in no event later than 48 hours after delivery of the material\nto be mailed together with envelopes or other reasonable containers therefor, postage or payment for postage and other reasonable expenses of effecting such\nmailing; provided, however, that such materials need not be mailed prior to the\nfirst day on which solicitation is made on behalf of management of the\nconverting institution. Except for information incorporated by reference to\nmanagement's own proxy statement, form of proxy or other solicitation\nmaterials, neither management of the converting institution nor the converting\ninstitution shall be responsible for the content of such materials. (e) Any proxy solicitation in\nconnection with approval of a plan of conversion pursuant to this Part shall be\nconducted in accordance with the following: (1)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in section\n86.6\nof this Part, proxy\nsolicitations subject to this Part may only be conducted by the thrift or an\neligible account holder or any person acting on behalf of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any person may finance a proxy solicitation\nconducted by an eligible account holder; provided that such financing and the\nnature of the person's interest, if any, in the transaction is disclosed. No\nperson providing financing may engage in any activity that would itself\nconstitute a proxy solicitation or that would amount to a proxy solicitation by\nan eligible account holder on behalf of that person. (2)\n\nNo proxy solicitation subject to this\n\nPart shall be made unless each person solicited is concurrently furnished, or\nhas previously been furnished, a written proxy statement on form 86-PS, the use\nof which has been approved by the Banking Department. Any eligible account\nholder submitting a proxy statement for review by the Banking Department shall\ndo so no less than five business days prior to its intended use. (3)\n\nAll additional proxy solicitation\nmaterials, including press releases, advertisements, and radio and television\nscripts, shall be submitted to the Banking Department for review at least five\nbusiness days before their intended use. Proxy solicitation materials approved\nfor use by the Banking Department shall be distributed to eligible account\nholders within 10 days of such authorization unless extended in writing by the\n\nBanking Department. (4)\n\nThe fact\nthat a proxy statement, form of proxy or other proxy solicitation material has\nbeen filed with or reviewed by the Banking Department and authorized for use\nshall not be deemed a finding by the Banking Department that such material is\naccurate or complete or not false or misleading, or that the Banking Department\nhas passed upon the merits of or endorsed or recommended any proposal contained\ntherein. No representation contrary to the foregoing shall be made by any\nperson. (5)\n\nAll proxy solicitation\nmaterials used by or on behalf of an eligible account holder shall include, at\na minimum, the name of the eligible account holder soliciting the proxy or on\nwhose behalf the proxy is being solicited, the name of the person(s) soliciting\nproxies on behalf of such eligible account holder, the length of time he or she\nhas been a depositor or shareholder, and the reasons he or she is making the\nsolicitation. If a proxy solicitation by an eligible account holder is being\nfinanced by a third party, such party's identity and interest, if any, in the\ntransaction shall be disclosed. (6)\n\nAll proxy solicitation materials used by or on behalf of an eligible account\nholder shall solicit proxies only for an affirmative or negative vote with\nrespect to the plan of conversion approved by the board of trustees or\ndirectors for presentation to eligible account holders and may not confer\ndiscretionary authority. (7)\n\nEligible account holders shall not engage in proxy solicitations at offices of\nthe thrift, except that, if the converting institution is making its proxy\nsolicitation materials available at its offices, it shall give any eligible\naccount holder conducting a proxy solicitation the opportunity to make his or\nher proxy solicitation materials available at such locations. The converting\ninstitution shall display such materials in clearly visible and accessible\nlocations in its offices and shall post a prominent and conspicuous notice of\ntheir availability. (f) A plan of conversion shall contain provisions to the effect that: (1)\n\nThe converting institution shall issue\nand sell its capital stock at a total price equal to the estimated pro forma\nmarket value of such stock in the converted institution (plus a control\npremium, if applicable) based on an independent valuation, as provided in this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nAn eligibility record\ndate shall be established which date shall be no more than 120 days and no less\nthan 30 days prior to the date on which the board of the converting institution\nadopts the plan of conversion. (3)\n\nFor a period of three years following the effective date of the conversion, no\nofficer, director, trustee (or any person who was an officer, director or\ntrustee at any time after the date on which the board adopts the plan of\nconversion), or associate of any of them shall, without the prior written\napproval of the superintendent, purchase or acquire direct or indirect\nbeneficial ownership of the capital stock of the converted institution, except\nfrom a broker or dealer registered with the Securities and Exchange\n\nCommission. (4)\n\nThe sale price of\nthe shares of capital stock to be sold in the conversion shall be a uniform\nprice determined in accordance with section\n86.5\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (5)\n\nThe conversion must be\ncompleted within a specified time period after the date on which the plan of\nconversion is approved by the superintendent. The time period shall be not more\nthan 24 months from the date on which the plan of conversion is approved by the\nsuperintendent. (6)\n\nEach time, savings or share account holder of the converting mutual institution shall\nbecome a withdrawable time or savings account in the converted stock-form\ninstitution equal in withdrawable amount to the withdrawal value of such\naccount in the converting mutual institution. (7)\nA liquidation account shall be\nestablished and maintained for the benefit of the eligible account holders in\nthe event of a subsequent complete liquidation of the converted institution in\naccordance with the provisions of subdivision (g) of this section. (8)\n\nThe holders of the capital stock of the\nconverted stock-form institution to be issued in connection with the conversion\nshall have exclusive voting rights, except as may be provided in the\norganization certificate as amended after the effective date of the\nconversion. (9)\n\nThe plan of\nconversion adopted by the converting institution's board of directors or\ntrustees may be substantively amended by such board as a result of comments\nreceived from regulatory authorities or otherwise prior to the solicitation of\nproxies from depositors or shareholders to vote on the plan of conversion and\nat any time thereafter with the concurrence of the superintendent; and the\nconversion (except a conversion effected pursuant to section\n86.6\n[b]\nof this\n\nPart) may be terminated by such board at any time prior to the meeting of\ndepositors or shareholders called to consider the plan of conversion and at any\ntime thereafter with the concurrence of the superintendent. (10)\n\nAll shares of capital stock of the\nconverting institution purchased or acquired (either directly or indirectly) by\ndirectors, trustees or executive officers (as such form is defined by Part 70\nof this Title) on original issue in the conversion either directly from the\ninstitution (by subscription or otherwise) or from an underwriter (or otherwise\nbeneficially owned by such directors, trustees or executive officers\nimmediately after such original issuance) shall be subject to the restriction\nthat the shares shall not be sold for a period of not less than one year\nfollowing the date of purchase, except in the event of death or judicial\ndeclaration of incompetency of the director, trustee or executive\nofficer. (11)\n\nIn connection with\nshares of capital stock of the converted stock-form institution subject to\nrestriction on resale: (i) each certificate\nfor such shares shall bear a legend giving appropriate notice of such\nrestriction; (ii)\nappropriate\ninstructions shall be issued to the transfer agent for the converted\ninstitution's capital stock with respect to applicable restrictions on transfer\nof any such restricted stock; and\n(iii)\nany shares issued as a stock dividend, stock split or otherwise with respect to any such restricted stock may not be\nsold until the restrictions respecting such originally restricted stock are\nterminated, and any certificate for such shares shall bear a legend advising of\nsuch restrictions. (12)\n\nThe converting institution, and in the case of a conversion calling for the\nformation of a holding company, such holding company, will restrict the\nrepurchases of its stock and the implementation of stock option and management\nand employee stock benefit plans as provided in subdivision (h) of this\nsection. (13)\n\nThe expenses incurred\nin the conversion shall be reasonable. (14)\n\nNo provision contained in such plan\nshall be determined by the superintendent to be inequitable or detrimental to\nthe converting institution, its depositors or shareholders, or to be contrary\nto the public interest. (15)\n\nThe\nconverting institution shall not loan funds or otherwise extend credit to any\nperson for the purpose of purchasing the capital stock of such\ninstitution. (g) Liquidation account. (1)\n\nEach converted\ninstitution shall, at the time of conversion, establish a liquidation account\nin an amount equal to at least the amount of net worth (determined in\naccordance with generally accepted accounting principles) of the converting\ninstitution as set forth in its latest statement of financial condition\ncontained in the proxy statement. The function of the liquidation account is to\nestablish a priority on liquidation by providing to eligible account holders\nrights upon liquidation of the converted institution initially at least equal\nto the rights that they have to the net worth of the institution if the\ninstitution were to be liquidated immediately prior to conversion and, except\nas provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the existence of the\nliquidation account shall not operate to restrict the use or application of any\nof the net worth accounts of the converted institution. (2)\n\nThe liquidation account shall be\nmaintained by the converted institution for the benefit of eligible account\nholders who maintain their accounts in such institution. Each such eligible\naccount holder shall, with respect to each account held, have a related\ninchoate interest in a portion of the liquidation account balance. (3)\n\nIn the event of a complete liquidation of\nthe converted institution (and only in such event), each eligible account\nholder shall be entitled to receive a liquidation distribution from the\nliquidation account in the amount of the then-current adjusted subaccount\nbalance for each account of such holder then in the converted institution, before any liquidation distribution may be made with respect to capital stock, except with respect to any preferred stock issued in exchange for the surrender\nat the time of the conversion of mutual capital certificates or other net worth\ncertificates which have been issued to its Federal deposit insurer by the\ninstitution prior to such conversion. Preferred stock issued in exchange for\nsuch certificates may receive distributions in liquidation prior to any\ndistribution to an eligible account holder with respect to the liquidation\naccount to the same extent that the holders of such certificates would have\nbeen entitled to priority over the residual rights of depositors or\nshareholders had the institution not been converted as of the date of\nliquidation. (4)\n\nThe initial\nsubaccount balance for an account held by an eligible account holder shall be\ndetermined by multiplying the aggregate opening balance in the liquidation\naccount by a fraction of which the numerator is the amount of deposits or\nshares in the account of such eligible account holder on the eligibility record\ndate and the denominator is the total amount of deposits or shares owned by all\neligible account holders in the converting institution on such date. Such\ninitial subaccount balance shall not be increased, and it shall be subject to\ndownward adjustment as provided in paragraph (e)(5) of this section. (5)\n\nIf the deposit or share balance in any\naccount of an eligible account holder at the end of any period for which the\nconverted institution has prepared audited financial statements subsequent to\nthe eligibility record date is less than the lesser of: (i) the deposit or share balance in such\naccount at the end of any period for which the converted institution has\nprepared audited financial statements subsequent to the eligibility record\ndate; or\n(ii)\nthe amount of the\ndeposits or shares as of the eligibility record date, the subaccount balance\nfor such account shall be adjusted by reducing such subaccount balance in an\namount proportionate to the reduction in such deposit or share balance. In the\nevent of such a downward adjustment, the subaccount balance shall not be\nsubsequently increased, notwithstanding any increase in the deposit or share\nbalance of the related account. If any such account is closed, the related\nsubaccount balance shall be reduced to zero. (h) Restrictions on repurchase of stock; payment of dividends; and use of stock option and management or employee stock\nbenefit plans. Each institution that converts pursuant to this Part shall be\nsubject to the following conditions: (1)\n\nExcept with the prior approval of the superintendent, no converted institution\nor holding company of a converted institution may repurchase any of its\noutstanding common stock prior to the first anniversary of the effective date\nof the conversion. Nor, during the second and third years following conversion, may there be a repurchase in excess of five percent of the holding company's or\nconverted institution's outstanding common stock in any 12-month period without\nthe prior approval of the superintendent. In determining whether to grant such\napproval, the superintendent shall consider: (i) the financial condition and history of\nthe holding company and/or the converted institution, as the case may\nbe; (ii)\nthe adequacy of its\ncapital structure; (iii)\nits future\nearnings prospects; (iv)\nthe\nquality of its management; (v) whether such repurchase shall result in fair treatment to the holding company\nor the converted institution, as the case may be; and\n(vi)\nthe public interest generally. (2)\n\nNo converted institution shall\ndeclare or pay a cash dividend on any of its capital stock if the effect\nthereof would cause the net worth of the converted institution to be reduced\nbelow the amount required to maintain the liquidation account. (3)\n\nFor a period of at least one year from\nthe effective date of the conversion, no converted institution shall implement\nany non-tax-qualified management of employee stock benefit plan or stock option\nplan unless: (i) each plan was fully\ndisclosed in the proxy solicitation and stock offering materials; (ii)\nthe total number of shares of common\nstock for which options may be granted does not exceed 10 percent of the amount\nof shares issued in the conversion; (iii)\nthe aggregate number of shares in\nmanagement and employee stock benefit plans does not exceed four percent of the\namount of shares issued in the conversion; (iv)\nno individual shall receive more than 25\npercent of the shares of any plan and directors who are not employees of the\ninstitution shall not receive more than five percent of the stock individually, or 30 percent in the aggregate, of any plan; (v) all plans are approved by a majority of\nthe institution's stockholders, or in the case of a holding company formed in\nconnection with the conversion, its stockholders, prior to implementation and\nno earlier than six months after the conversion; (vi)\nthe exercise price of options shall be\nthe market price at which the stock is trading at the date of grant; and\n(vii)\nno conversion stock is\nused to fund management or employee stock benefit plans. (i) Manipulative and deceptive\ndevices. In connection with the conversion of a thrift to stock form, or the\noffer, sale or purchase of capital stock issued in connection with such\nconversion, no institution, any director, officer or trustee thereof, any\nperson soliciting proxies or acting on behalf of any person soliciting proxies\nin connection with such conversion, or any person seeking to acquire control of\nsuch institution, shall: (1)\nemploy any\ndevice, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2)\nmake any untrue statement of a material\nfact, or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the\nstatements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or\n(3)\nengage in\nany act, transaction, practice, or course of business which operated or would\noperate as a fraud or deceit upon a purchaser or seller of such capital\nstock. (j) No person may\noffer to distribute cash or other valuable consideration to eligible account\nholders in connection with any conversion other than, with the prior approval\nof the superintendent, a supervisory conversion pursuant to section\n86.12\nof this Part. (k) Acquisition of the securities of\nconverting and converted institutions. (1)\n\nPrior to the completion of a conversion, no person shall offer to transfer, or\nenter into any agreement or understanding to transfer, the legal or beneficial\nownership of the capital stock to be issued in connection with the conversion, except pursuant to or contemplated by the plan of conversion filed with the\nsuperintendent. (2)\n\nPrior to the\ncompletion of a conversion, no person shall make any offer, or any announcement\nof an offer, for any security of the converting institution issued in\nconnection with the conversion nor shall any person knowingly acquire\nsecurities of the converted institution issued in connection with the\nconversion in excess of the maximum purchase limitations established in the\ninstitution's approved plan of conversion. (3)\n\nExcept with the prior approval of the\nsuperintendent, no person for a period of one year following the date of the\ncompletion of the conversion shall directly or indirectly acquire or offer to\nacquire the beneficial ownership of more than 10 percent of any class of\ncapital stock of an institution converted in accordance with the provisions of\nthis Part. In addition to the provisions of this section, the provisions of\narticle III-A of the Banking Law shall apply to any such acquisition. (l) Tax opinions and rulings. The\nsuperintendent may refuse to approve any plan of conversion which may in the\njudgment of the superintendent result in a taxable reorganization of the\nconverting institution under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as\namended. (m) Consents of experts. If any accountant, attorney, investment banker, appraiser, or other person\nwhose professions give authority to a statement made in any document filed\nunder this Part is named as having prepared, reviewed, passed upon, or\ncertified any part thereof, or any report or valuation for use in connection\ntherewith, the written consent of such person shall be filed with the\napplication for conversion. If any portion of a report of an expert is quoted\nor summarized as such in any filing, the written consent of the expert shall\nexpressly state that the expert consents to such use. All written consents\nfiled pursuant to this subdivision shall be dated and signed manually. A list\nof such consents shall be filed with the application for conversion. Where the\nconsent of the expert is contained in his report, a reference shall be made in\nthe list to the report containing such consent. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
