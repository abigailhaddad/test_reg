  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 661.14 - Determination that lands do not involve littoral zone or coastal shoals, bars or flats\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe commissioner may amend an inventory map pursuant to\nthe procedures set forth in section\n661.17\nof this Part where he\ndetermines that certain lands under tidal waters, while possessing the physical\ncharacteristics of littoral zone or coastal shoals, bars or flats, are not\nlittoral zone or coastal shoals, bars or flats or any other type of tidal\nwetlands because such lands do not function biologically as tidal wetlands, exhibit little primary productivity and are populated by few benthic organisms, due to such factors as pollution, sedimentation or other physical disturbances. The commissioner may take such action on his own motion or at the request of\nany person. Such a request shall set forth the specific boundaries of the\nproposed amendment and the necessary information on which a decision on the\nrequest may be made. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n661.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
