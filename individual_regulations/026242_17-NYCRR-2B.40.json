  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2B.40 - ONE WAY Signs (R6-1, R6-2)\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE Paragraph 13. INSERT the following paragraphs: Support: 01A The R6-1 sign has greater legibility than the R6-2\nsign, and is generally preferred. The R6-2 sign has an advantage where lateral\nspace is limited, such as in heavily developed urban areas. Guidance: 11A The use of ONE WAY signs within a roundabout should be\nlimited to low speed locations where the roundabout geometry or visibility of\nother signing does not make the circulating direction evident. Support: 11B Using ONE WAY signs on the central island of a\nroundabout might result in some drivers incorrectly concluding that the cross\nstreet is a one-way street; using Roundabout Directional Arrow signs is the\npreferred approach to avoid this confusion. 11C Where additional information regarding the roundabout\ncirculating direction is deemed necessary, it is preferable to use Roundabout\n\nCirculation (R6-5P) plaques (see Section 2B.44). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2B.40\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
