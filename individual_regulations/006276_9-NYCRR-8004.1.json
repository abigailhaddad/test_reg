  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8004.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A person\nwho fails to comply with the terms of their release may be declared delinquent, and may be returned to a correctional facility. A person on presumptive, parole\nor conditional release, or serving a period of post-release supervision, may be\nreturned to a correctional facility for a period equal to the remaining portion\nof their sentence(s), and for any remaining period of post-release supervision. A person on conditional release under a definite sentence of imprisonment may\nbe returned for a period equal to the unexpired portion of the term of\nimprisonment as of the date of their conditional release. (b) A violation of a term of release in an\nimportant respect may be a non-technical violation, or a technical violation\nwhether or not reincarceration is authorized for such. (c) If, at the final hearing, the presiding\nofficer concludes that the conduct established by the appropriate standard of\nproof under section\n8005.20\nof this Title is\ninsufficient to sustain the charge as the type of violation described, but\nsufficient to sustain the charge as a violation with an authorized disposition\nof lesser severity, it shall be so sustained and the charge conformed to the\nproof, provided that the notice afforded to the releasee was sufficient to\ninform them of the conduct comprising such conformed charge. (d) The term parole warrant shall mean a\nwarrant for the retaking and temporary detention of a releasee in accordance\nwith the Executive Law and section\n8004.5\nof this Part. (e) The term violation as used in this Part\nand Part 8005 of this Title, and in section\n8002.6\nof this Title, may refer to\nan individual act of violating a condition of release. Multiple violations may\nbe charged and sustained within a single parole revocation case. (f) \"Absconding\" means intentionally avoiding\nsupervision by failing to maintain contact or communication with the releasee's\nparole officer or area office / bureau and to notify his or her assigned parole\nofficer or area office / bureau of a change in residence, and reasonable\nefforts by the parole officer to re-engage the releasee have been unsuccessful. Evidence that reasonable efforts by the parole officer to re-engage the\nreleasee have been unsuccessful may be provided by the Department during\nrevocation proceedings and such reasonable efforts need not be alleged in\nwriting within a charge or charges. Evidence that the releasee has voluntarily\nsurrendered to custody or that they have at some point re-engaged with the\nparole officer does not necessarily preclude a finding of absconding. (g) A releasee may, as a condition of release\nand/or instruction of the parole officer, be directed to appear at any parole\nrevocation process appearance, including the appearance directed in response to\na notice of violation, and any preliminary and/or final revocation hearing and\nany adjourned or continuation appearances therefrom. A violation of such\ndirection may provide basis for the releasee's retaking and temporary detention\nconsistent with further provisions of this Part or as ordered by a court. A\nreleasee may also be directed to appear at any recognizance hearing to occur\nfollowing execution of a parole warrant. (h) Being in the company of, or fraternizing\nwith, a person the releasee knows to have a criminal record or to have been\nadjudicated a youthful offender shall not in itself be prohibited by a\ncondition of release or form the basis for a parole revocation. However, conditions of release that prohibit a releasee from having contact with\nspecified individuals, or other specified groups including criminal\norganizations or gangs, are not precluded. (i) Conduct related to cannabis that is\nlawful pursuant to the laws of this State shall not in itself form the basis\nfor a parole revocation except where violative of a special condition, which\ncondition may only be imposed upon clear and convincing evidence that the\nprohibition is reasonably related to the releasee's underlying crime(s). In a\nrevocation proceeding any such condition is presumed to have met the applicable\nstandard for imposition and the propriety of such imposition shall not be\nreviewable in such context. (j) Reincarceration as used in this Part and Part 8005 of this Title, and as may be\nused in section\n8002.6\nof this Title, includes a\ntime assessment which may be imposed with the disposition of a parole\nrevocation case where one or more violation charges are sustained. A time\nassessment may be imposed for each sustained violation for which a period of\nreincarceration is authorized provided, however, that in a single revocation\ncase all such periods imposed shall run concurrently. (k) Mental capacity/fitness of a releasee who\nis an alleged violator of the conditions of release. (1)\n\nIf, prior to the issuance of a notice of\nviolation or parole warrant where no notice has been issued, a releasee has\nbeen determined to be currently mentally unfit to proceed to trial or is\ncurrently subject to a temporary or final order of observation pursuant to\narticle seven hundred thirty of the Criminal Procedure Law, no notice of\nviolation or warrant shall be issued at that time. (2)\n\nIf, from a recognizance hearing\nappearance pursuant to the Executive Law, the releasee has been referred for a\ndetermination of their mental fitness to proceed in a manner consistent with\nthe provisions of article seven hundred thirty of the Criminal Procedure Law\nand been determined by a court of law to currently be an incapacitated person\nas that term is defined in subdivision one of section\n730.10\nof the Criminal Procedure Law, no\npreliminary or final revocation proceedings shall be scheduled to occur at that\ntime or during the period in which the alleged violator is subject to the order\nof observation. (3)\n\nWhere a hearing\nofficer at a preliminary or final parole revocation hearing appearance has\nstayed the revocation proceedings for a superior court determination, pursuant\nto the Executive Law, regarding the alleged violator's mental fitness to\nproceed in a manner consistent with the provisions of article seven hundred\nthirty of the criminal procedure law: (i) If\nthe superior court in such circumstances determines that the alleged violator\nis not an incapacitated person, then following the court's notice of such\ndetermination to the Board, the revocation case shall proceed with reasonable\nallowance for appropriate scheduling and notice thereof; or\n(ii)\n\nIf the superior court in such\ncircumstances determines that the alleged violator is an incapacitated person\nand issues a final order of observation committing such person to the custody\nof the commissioner of mental health or the commissioner of developmental\ndisabilities for care and treatment in an appropriate institution, following\nthe Board's timely receipt of notice of such determination from the court and\nnotification of the facility/institution designation by the appropriate\ncommissioner, the hearing officer shall dismiss the violation charges and such\ndismissal shall act as a bar to any further revocation proceeding against the\nalleged violator for such violations.
