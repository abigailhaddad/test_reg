  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 417.7 - Transfer of a license as an importing transporter\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 283(9), 283-a(6)\n(a) The license granted to an importing\ntransporter by the Department of Taxation and Finance is personal to the person\nto whom it is granted. (b) The\ntransfer of a license as an importing transporter to another person without the\nprior written approval of the department is invalid and will not be recognized\nby the department and is grounds for the immediate cancellation or suspension\nof the license. (c) addition to the\nusual meaning, a\ntransfer of a license\nhas occurred if: (1)\na new partner is added to the entity\nlicensed as an importing transporter or a new person replaces an existing\npartner in such entity; or\n(2)\nshares of stock are acquired by any person so that such person owns or\ncontrols, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the number of shares\nof voting stock of an entity licensed as an importing transporter (in the case\nof a licensee which has four or fewer shareholders owning such voting stock, \"25 percent or more\" is substituted for \"more than 10 percent\" in applying this\nparagraph). (d) An\napplication for approval of contemplated transfer must be made to the\ndepartment. Such application is made in the same manner as an application for a\nlicense to operate as an importing transporter. The same information and\ndocuments required upon the application for license to operate as an importing\ntransporter must be submitted. In addition, a statement describing the\ntransaction which will constitute the transfer including the date of the\nproposed transfer, the identities of the parties to the transaction, the\ninterests which are proposed to be transferred and responsible persons\n(officers, directors, partners, shareholders owning more than 10 percent of\nvoting stock, employees under a duty to act for such applicant in complying\nwith any requirement of article 12-A of the Tax Law) of the entity which is the\nsubject of the application for approval of contemplated transfer must also be\nprovided. (e) Within 75 days after\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance has been supplied with the properly\ncompleted application and any other documents or additional information\nrequested, it will issue a determination either granting or denying the\napplication for approval of transfer. The determination of the department must\nbe based on the same criteria used in making a determination with respect to an\napplication for a license as an importing transporter. If the department fails\nto issue a determination within 75 days, it is required to give its approval to\nthe application. Any determination issued pursuant to this subdivision may only\nbe protested in the same manner and upon the same conditions as a determination\nrespecting an application for a registration or license. (f) Upon approval of the application, the\ndepartment may either issue a new license as an importing transporter or\nreissue the existing license, provided a bond or other security, in the\nrequired amount, is filed or deposited with the department. (g) (1)\n\nThere is an exception to the requirement of prior approval for transfers of\nlicenses in the case of transfers by way of bequest or inheritance from the\ndecedent directly, to: (i) an ancestor of the\ndecedent; (ii)\nthe spouse of the\ndecedent; (iii)\na lineal descendent\nof the decedent, of the decedent's spouse, or of a parent of the decedent; or\n(iv)\nthe spouse of any lineal\ndescendent described in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. (2)\n(i) A transfer of a license as an importing\ntransporter occasioned by a bequest to or inheritance received by the\nindividuals described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision will not, of itself, be considered a transfer which will operate as grounds to cancel such license\nif a revised application for license is submitted to the department within 90\ndays of the death of the decedent. The failure to submit a revised application\nwithin such 90 days will be grounds for immediate cancellation or suspension of\nthe license as an importing transporter. (ii)\n\nSuch application for a license may be\nfiled in all cases by an interested relative enumerated in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision or by the personal representative of the decedent and in the\ncase of a corporation or partnership by the entity licensed as the importing\ntransporter. (3)\n\nThe\ndepartment will review such application in the same manner as an application\nfor license as an importing transporter and any of the grounds for denying, cancelling or suspending an application for a license as an importing\ntransporter as specified in article 12-A of the Tax Law, are grounds for the\ndepartment to deny the revised application. A denial issued pursuant to this\nparagraph may only be protested in the same manner and upon the same conditions\nas a denial of an application for a registration or license. (4)\n\nUpon approval of the revised application, the department may either issue a new license as an importing transporter or\nreissue the existing license, provided a bond or other security, in the\nrequired amount, is filed or deposited with the department.
