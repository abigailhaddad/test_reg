  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 120.1 - Credit against ordinary tax for income tax of another state, a political subdivision of another state, the District of Columbia, or a province of Canada\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 620(a)\n(a) General. (1)\n\nWhere a resident individual receives\nincome derived from sources within another state of the United States, a\npolitical subdivision of another state, the District of Columbia, or a province\nof Canada, such resident individual is entitled to a credit against his or her\nordinary tax (see section\n101.1\nof this Title) for any income tax imposed on such income by the other\njurisdiction. The term\nincome tax imposed, as used in this\nsection and in sections\n120.2\nthrough\n120.5\nof this Part, does not include the portion of such tax (determined in\naccordance with the provisions of section\n120.6\n[b]\nof this Part) imposed on the ordinary income portion (or part thereof) of a\nlump sum distribution which is subject to the separate tax imposed by section\n603\nof the Tax Law. (See section\n120.6\nof this Part for the credit allowable against the separate tax on the ordinary\nincome portion [or part thereof] of a lump sum distribution.) A resident estate\nor trust is also entitled to a similar credit against ordinary tax, computed in\nthe same way and subject to the same exception and limitations, set forth in\nthis section and sections\n120.2\nthrough\n120.5\nof this Part, as in the case of a resident individual. (2)\n\nThe credit against ordinary tax is\nallowable only for that portion of the income tax imposed by another state of\nthe United States, a political subdivision of another state, the District of\n\nColumbia, or a province of Canada (or both another state of the United States\nand also one or more of its political subdivisions) which is applicable to the\nincome derived from sources within such other taxing jurisdiction. (See section\n120.4\n[d]\nof this Part for the definition of the term\nincome derived from sources\nwithin\nanother jurisdiction, and subdivision [c] of such section for\nthe definition of\nincome tax imposed by the other\njurisdiction. )\n(b) Method of claiming credit. (1)\n\nIf a resident individual claims a credit\nagainst ordinary tax under this Part, such resident individual must attach to\nhis or her New York State personal income tax return the credit claim\nform. (2)\n\nIf two or more taxing\njurisdictions (as defined in this paragraph) impose income taxes on the same or\ndifferent amounts of income derived from sources within such taxing\njurisdictions, a separate New York State credit claim form must be attached to\nthe taxpayer's New York State personal income tax return for each jurisdiction\nfor which credit is claimed. The term\ntwo or more taxing\njurisdictions, as used in this section and in section\n120.2\nof\nthis Part, means any combination of states (other than New York State), political subdivisions of different states (other than both a state and one or\nmore of its political subdivisions as provided in paragraph [3] of this\nsubdivision), the District of Columbia, and provinces of Canada. (3)\n\nIf both a state (other than New York\n\nState) and one or more of the political subdivisions of such state impose\nincome taxes on the same or different amounts of income, derived from sources\nwithin such state and one or more of its political subdivisions, the sum of the\nincome taxes paid to the state and its political subdivisions must be reported\non a single credit claim form. (See also section\n120.3\nof this Part.)\n(4)\nA resident\nestate or trust must also comply with the provisions of this subdivision in\norder to claim a credit for an income tax of another state, a political\nsubdivision or subdivisions of another state, the District of Columbia, or a\nprovince or provinces of Canada.
