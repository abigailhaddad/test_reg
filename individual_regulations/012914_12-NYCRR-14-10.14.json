  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-10.14 - Checking safety valve capacity\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Safety-valve capacity may be checked in\nany one of three different ways: (1)\n\nBy\nmaking an accumulation test, that is, by shutting off all other steam-discharge\noutlets from the boiler and forcing the fires to the maximum. The safety-valve\nequipment shall be sufficient to prevent an excess pressure beyond that\nspecified in section\n14-9.9\nof this Part. (2)\n\nBy measuring the maximum amount of fuel\nthat can be burned and computing the corresponding evaporative capacity upon\nthe basis of the heating value of the fuel. (3)\n\nBy determining the maximum evaporative\ncapacity by measuring the feedwater. The sum of the safety-valve capacities\nshall be equal to or greater than the maximum evaporative capacity of the\nboiler. (b) If the\nsafety valve capacity is found sufficient, additional capacity need not be\nprovided. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-10.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
