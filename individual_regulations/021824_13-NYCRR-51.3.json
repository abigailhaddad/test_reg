  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 13 § 51.3 - Financial reports to be rendered by a theatrical production company\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe financial reports listed below are to be prepared in the manner set forth in\nthe applicable portion of section\n51.5\nof\nthis Part and are to be submitted when due to all investors, and, except where otherwise noted, to the Department of Law and where the report is\nunaudited, accompanied by a letter of transmittal subscribed to by the issuer or other offeror as set forth in section\n51.4\nof this Part. (a) A pre-opening report consisting of a balance sheet covering each six-month period (or portion thereof)\noccurring prior to the first paid performance of any production produced, developed or invested in by the theatrical production company. Each such\nreport shall also include a schedule of production costs incurred during the period and, if applicable, a cumulative schedule of total production\ncosts. The first such report shall be due six months and 30 days after the initial expenditure of investors' funds for any such production other than\nthe funds of any principal or front money investors (but shall include such latter transactions) or not later than 30 days after the close of the\nperiod covered thereby. This subdivision shall only be applicable to periods not covered by a previously issued annual report, as defined hereafter, or an annual report required to be issued by this Part, which covers a period ending with the close of the applicable six-month period. (b) A monthly report consisting of a summary balance sheet (or financial summary or analysis) and profit and loss\nstatement for each theatrical production produced, developed or invested in by the theatrical production company covering each monthly period (or\nportion thereof) beginning with the date of the first paid tryout performance (or opening if there is none) of any such production and continuing\nuntil the last public performance of the original production. Such monthly report is due not later than 30 days after the close of the period covered\nthereby. The monthly report shall be submitted to all investors but need not be submitted to the Department of Law. (Until the capital is recouped, the monthly reports should describe the excess of income over expense as amounts recovered for the period, and not as profit.)\n(c) An annual report consisting of a balance sheet (or similar financial summary or analysis) and profit and loss\nstatement for each 12-month period (or portion thereof), occurring prior to the last public performance of any production produced, developed or\ninvested in by the theatrical production company. All annual reports covering a period ending prior to the opening of any such production or in which\nthe opening occurred shall also include a schedule of production costs incurred during the period, and if applicable, a cumulative statement of total\nproduction costs. The first annual report shall be due four months after the close of 12 months following initial expenditure of investors' funds\n(other than the funds of any principal or front money investors) in any such production, but shall include all previous financial transactions. If\nthe production closes prior to the end of the 12-month period after the initial expenditure of investors' funds, then the first report is due four\nmonths after the last public performance. Each succeeding annual report is due four months after the close of the period covered thereby. The\nstatement of production costs should show comparison with the budgeted amount, with large variations explained. Such annual reports shall continue to\nbe made for each year in which the theatrical production company has had any earnings or expenditures or other financial transactions of any nature\nand shall include in addition to a balance sheet (or financial summary or analysis) a statement of earnings and expenditures as well as a description\nof any financial transactions such as settlement of accounts, loans by the theatrical production company, and any other transactions not reflected in\nthe statement of earnings and expenditures. The issuer or other offeror's accountant may obtain a 30-day extension in filing the annual report by\nadvising the Department of Law in writing, prior to the due date of the annual report, that such report will be submitted no later than 30 days\nfollowing the original due date. (d) In those cases where the proceeds of the theatrical production\ncompany, or any part thereof, are used to develop or invest in a production or productions not under the direct control of the issuer or other\nofferor, such issuer or other offeror shall require, through a legally enforceable contract, that the above reports be provided as set forth in this\n\nPart. (e) With respect to a theatrical production company formed to produce, develop or invest in more\nthan one specified or nonspecified theatrical production, in addition to the above reports, an annual report of the theatrical production company, consisting of a balance sheet and profit and loss statement for each fiscal year of the theatrical production company.
