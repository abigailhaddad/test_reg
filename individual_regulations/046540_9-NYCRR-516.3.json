  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 516.3 - Initiation of charges; apprehension; pretrial restraint; related matters\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Report of\noffense. (1)\n\nWho may report. Any person may\nreport an offense subject to trial by court-martial. (2)\n\nTo whom reports conveyed for disposition. Ordinarily, any military authority who receivea a report of an offense shall\nforward as soon as practicable the report and any accompanying information to\nthe immediate commander of the suspect. Competent authority superior to that\ncommander may direct otherwise. (b) Apprehension. (1)\n\nDefinition and scope. (i) Definition. Apprehension is the taking of\na person into custody. (ML, 130.7 [a]). (ii)\n\nScope. This subdivision applies only to\napprehensions made by persons authorized to do so under paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision with respect to offenses subject to trial by court-martial. Nothing\nin this subdivision limits the authority of the Federal or State law\nenforcement officials to apprehend persons, whether or not subject to trial by\ncourt-martial, to the extent permitted by applicable enabling statutes and\nother law. Nothing in this subdivision shall be construed to limit the\nauthority of persons authorized to apprehend offenders to secure the custody of\nan alleged offender until proper authority may be notified (ML, 130.9[e]). (2)\n\nWho may\napprehend. The following officials may apprehend any person subject to trial by\ncourt-martial (see ML, 130.7): (i) Military\nlaw enforcement officials. Security police, military police, master-at-arms\npersonnel, members of the shore patrol, and persons designated by proper\nauthorities to perform military criminal investigative, guard, or police\nduties, whether subject to the code or not, when, in each of the foregoing\ninstances, the official making the apprehension is in the execution of law\nenforcement duties. (ii)\n\nCivilian\nlaw enforcement officials. Peace officers acting pursuant to their special\nduties and police officers. (iii)\n\nCommissioned, warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers. All commissioned, warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers on active State duty, annual\ntraining, or during inactive duty training or when on any ordered military\nduty. (iv)\n\nCivilians authorized to\napprehend deserters. Under ML, 130.8, any civil officer having authority to\napprehend offenders under laws of the United States of any state, territory, commonwealth, or possession, when the apprehension is of a deserter from the\norganized militia. (3)\n\nGrounds for apprehension. A person subject to the code may be apprehended for\nan offense triable by court-martial upon probable cause to apprehend (see also\nML, 130.9[d]). Probable cause to apprehend exists when there are reasonable\ngrounds to believe that an offense has been or is being committed and the\nperson to be apprehended committed or is committing it. Persons authorized to\napprehend under subparagraph (2)(iii) of this subdivision may also apprehend\npersons subject to the code who take part in quarrels, frays, or disorders\namong persons subject to the code, wherever they occur. (4)\n\nHow an apprehension may be made. (i) In general. An apprehension is made by\nclearly notifying the person to be apprehended that that person is in custody. This notice must be given orally or in writing (ML, 130.9[b] and\n[c]). (ii)\n\nWarrants. Neither\nwarrants nor any other authorization shall be required for an apprehension\nunder these rules except as required in subparagraph (5)(ii) of this\nsubdivision. (iii)\n\nUse of force. Any person authorized under these rules to make an apprehension may use such\nforce and means as reasonably necessary under the circumstances to effect the\napprehension. (5)\n\nWhere\nan apprehension may be made. (i) In general. An apprehension may be made at any place, except as provided in subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph. (ii)\n\nPrivate dwellings. A private dwelling includes dwellings, on or off a military\ninstallation, such as single family houses, duplexes, and apartments. The\nquarters may be owned, leased, or rented by the residents, or assigned, and may\nbe occupied on a temporary or permanent basis. \"Private dwelling\" does not\ninclude the following, whether or not subdivided into individual units: living\nareas in military barracks, vessels, aircraft, vehicles, tents, bunkers, field\nencampments, and similar places. No person may enter a private dwelling for the\npurpose of making an apprehension under these rules unless: (a) Pursuant to consent under Mil. R. Evid. 314(e) or 316(d)(2); (b) Under\nexigent circumstances described in Mil. R. Evid. 315(g) or\n316(d)(4)(B); (c) In the case of a\nprivate dwelling which is military property or under military control, or\nnonmilitary property in a foreign country: (1)\nif the person to be apprehended is a\nresident of the private dwelling, there exists, at the time of the entry, reason to believe that the person to be apprehended is present in the dwelling, and the apprehension has been authorized by an official listed in Mil. R. Evid. 315(d) upon a determination that probable cause to apprehend the person exists; or ordered the arrest or a superior authority, on duty inconsistent with the\nstatus of arrest, but this shall not prevent requiring the person arrested to\ndo ordinary cleaning or policing, or to take part in routine training and\nduties; (2)\nif the person to be\napprehended is not a resident of the private dwelling, the entry has been\nauthorized by an official listed in Mil. R. Evid. 315(d) upon a determination\nthat probable cause exists to apprehend the person and to believe that the\nperson to be apprehended is or will be present at the time of the\nentry. (d) In the case\nof a private dwelling not included in clause (c) of this subparagraph: (1)\nif the person to be apprehended is a\nresident of the private dwelling, there exists at the time of the entry, reason\nto believe that the person to be apprehended is present and the apprehension is\nauthorized by an arrest warrant issued by competent civilian authority; or\n(2)\nif the person to be\napprehended is not a resident of the private dwelling the apprehension is\nauthorized by an arrest warrant and the entry is authorized by a search\nwarrant, each issued by competent civilian authority. A person who is not a resident of the private dwelling\nentered may not challenge the legality of his or her own apprehension on the\nbasis of failure to secure a warrant or authorization to enter that dwelling, or on the basis of the sufficiency of such a warrant or authorization. Nothing\nin this subparagraph affects the legality of an apprehension which is incident\nto otherwise lawful presence in a private dwelling. (c) Preliminary inquiry into reported\noffenses. Upon receipt of information that a member of the command is accused\nor suspected of committing an offense or offenses triable by court- martial, the immediate commander shall make or cause to be made a preliminary inquiry\ninto the charges or suspected offenses. The commander should seek the advice of\nhis staff judge advocate before taking any action. (d) Pretrial restraint. (1)\n\nTypes of pretrial restraint. Pretrial\nrestraint is moral or physical restraint on a person's liberty which is imposed\nbefore and during disposition of offenses. Pretrial restraint may consist of\nconditions on liberty, arrest, or confinement. (ML, 130.9[a]). (i) Conditions on liberty. Conditions on\nliberty are imposed by orders directing a person to do or refrain from doing\nspecified acts. Such conditions may be imposed in conjunction with other forms\nof restraint or separately. (ii)\n\nArrest. Arrest is the restraint of a person by oral or written order not\nimposed as punishment, directing the person to remain within specified limits; a person in the status of arrest may not be required to perform full military\nduties such as commanding or supervising personnel, serving as guard, or\nbearing arms. The status of arrest automatically ends when the person is\nplaced, by the authority who ordered the arrest or a superior authority on duty\ninconsistent with the status of arrest, but this shall not prevent requiring\nthe person arrested to do ordinary cleaning or policing, or to take part in\nroutine training and duties. (iii)\n\nConfinement. Pretrial confinement is physical restraint, imposed by order of\ncompetent authority, depriving a person of freedom pending disposition of\noffenses (see N.Y.R.C.M. 305). (2)\n\nWho may order pretrial restraint. (i) of officers and warrant officers. Only a\ncommanding officer to whose authority the officer or warrant officer is subject\nmay order pretrial restraint of that officer or warrant officer (ML, 130.9[c]). (ii)\n\nOf enlisted\npersons. Any officer may order pretrial restraint of any enlisted\nperson. (iii)\n\nDelegation of\nauthority. The authority to order pretrial restraint of officers and warrant\nofficers may not be delegated. A commanding officer may delegate to warrant, petty, and noncommissioned officers authority to order pretrial restraint of\nenlisted persons of the commanding officer's command or subject to the\nauthority of that commanding officer. (iv)\n\nAuthority to withhold. A superior\ncompetent authority may withhold from a subordinate the authority to order\npretrial restraint. An order withholding such authority shall be in\nwriting. (3)\n\nWhen a\nperson may be restrained. No person may be ordered into restraint before trial\nexcept for probable cause. Probable cause to order pretrial restraint exists\nwhen there is a reasonable belief that: (i) an offense triable by court-martial has been committed; (ii)\nthe person to be restrained committed\nit; and\n(iii)\nthe restraint ordered\nis required by the circumstances. (4)\n\nProcedures for ordering pretrial\nrestraint. Pretrial restraint other than confinement is imposed by notifying\nthe person orally or in writing of the restraint, including its terms or\nlimits. The order to an enlisted person must be delivered personally by the\nauthority who issues it or through other persons subject to the code (ML, 13.9[b]). The order to an officer must be delivered personally by the authority\nwho issues it or by another commissioned officer (ML, 130.9[c]). Pretrial\nconfinement is imposed pursuant to orders by a competent authority by the\ndelivery of a person to a place of confinement. (5)\n\nNotice of basis for restraint. When a\nperson is placed under restraint, the person shall be informed of the nature of\nthe offense which is the basis for such restraint (ML, 130.10). (6)\n\nPunishment prohibited. Pretrial restraint\nis not punishment and must not be used as such. No person who is restrained\npending trial may be subjected to punishment or penalty for the offense which\nis the basis for that restraint. Prisoners being held for trial must not be\nrequired to undergo punitive duty hours or training, perform punitive labor, or\nwear special uniforms prescribed only for post-trial prisoners. This\nsubdivision does not prohibit minor punishment during pretrial confinement for\ninfractions of the rules of the place of confinement. (ML, 130.13). Prisoners\nmust be afforded facilities and treatment under regulations of the Department\nof Corrections of the State of New York. (7)\n\nRelease. Except as otherwise provided in\nN.Y.R.C.M. 305, a person may be released from pretrial restraint by a person\nauthorized to impose it. Pretrial restraint terminates when a sentence is\nadjudged, the accused is acquitted of all charges, or all charges are\ndismissed. (8)\n\nAdministrative\nrestraint. Nothing in this subdivision prohibits limitations on a service\nmember imposed for operational or other military purposes independent of\nmilitary justice, including administrative hold or medical reasons. (e) Pretrial confinement. (1)\n\nIn general. Pretrial confinement is\nphysical restraint, imposed by order of competent authority, depriving a person\nof freedom pending disposition of charges. It is executed only at a guard house\nor at a jail, penitentiary, or prison designated by the Governor or\n\nCommissioner of the Department of Corrections, State of New York for that\npurpose (ML, 130.11). (2)\n\nWho may\nbe confined. Any person who is subject to the code may be confined if the\nrequirements of this subdivision are met. (3)\n\nWho may order confinement. (See\nN.Y.R.C.M. 304 [b].) No provost marshal, commander of a guard, master-at-arms\nor warden, keeper or officer of a city or county jail or of any other jail, penitentiary, or prison designated by the Governor or Commissioner of the\n\nDepartment of Corrections may refuse to his charge by a commissioned officer of\nthe Armed Forces, when the committing officer furnishes a statement, signed by\nhim, of the offense charged against the prisoner (ML, 130.12[a]). (4)\n\nWhen a person may be confined. No person\nmay be ordered into pretrial confinement except for probable cause (ML, 130.9[d]). Probable cause to order pretrial confinement exists when there is a\nreasonable belief that: (i) an offense\ntriable by court-martial has been committed; (ii)\nthe person confined committed it; and\n(iii)\nconfinement is required\nby the circumstances. (5)\n\nAdvice to the accused upon confinement. Each person must be promptly informed of: (i) the nature of the offenses for which held; (ii)\nthe to remain silent and that any\nstatement made by the person may be used against the person; (iii)\nthe right to retain counsel at no\nexpense to the State, and the right to request assignment of military counsel; and\n(iv)\nthe procedures by which\npretrial confinement will be reviewed. (6)\n\nMilitary counsel. If requested by the\nprisoner, military counsel must be provided to the prisoner before the initial\nreview under paragraph (9) of this subdivision. Counsel may be assigned for the\nlimited purpose of representing the accused only during the pretrial\nconfinement proceedings before charges are referred. If assignment is made for\nthis limited purpose, the prisoner must be so informed. Unless otherwise\nprovided by regulations of the Chief of Staff to the Governor, a prisoner does\nnot have a right under this subdivision to have military counsel of the\nprisoner's own selection. (7)\n\nWho\nmay direct release from confinement. Any commander of a prisoner, an officer\nappointed by the Chief of Staff to the Governor to conduct the review under\nparagraph (9) of this subdivision, or, once charges have been referred, a\nmilitary judge detailed to the court- martial to which the charges against the\naccused have been referred may direct release from pretrial confinement. For\npurposes of this subdivision, any commander includes the immediate or higher\ncommander of the prisoner and the commander of the installation on which the\nconfinement facility is located. (8)\n\nNotification and action by commander. (i) Report. Unless the commander of the\nprisoner ordered to pretrial confinement, the commissioned, warrant, non-commissioned, or petty officer, or the commander of a guard, master-at-arms, warden, keeper or officer of a city or county jail or of any\nother jail, penitentiary or prison designated by the Governor or Commissioner\nof the Department of Corrections to whose charge the prisoner was committed\nmust, within 24 hours after that commitment, cause to be made a report to the\ncommander which must contain the name of the prisoner, the offenses charged\nagainst the prisoner, and the name of the person who ordered or authorized\nconfinement (see ML, 130.12[b]). (ii)\n\nAction by commander. (a) Decision. Not later than 72 hours after\nordering a prisoner into pretrial confinement, or after receipt of a report\nthat a member of the commander's unit or organization has been confined, the\ncommander must decide whether pretrial confinement will continue. (b) Requirements for confinement. The\ncommander must direct the prisoner's release from pretrial confinement unless\nthe commander believes upon probable cause, that is, upon reasonable grounds, that: (1)\nan offense triable by a\ncourt-martial has been committed; (2)\nthe prisoner committed it; and\n(3)\nconfinement is necessary because it is\nforeseeable that: (i) the prisoner will not\nappear at a trial, pretrial hearing, or investigation; or\n(ii)\nthe prisoner will engage in serious\ncriminal misconduct; and\n(iii)\nless\nsevere forms of restraint are inadequate. Serious criminal misconduct includes intimidation of\nwitnesses or other obstruction of justice, seriously injuring others, or other\noffenses which pose a serious threat to the safety of the community or to the\neffectiveness, morale, discipline, readiness, or safety of the command, or to\nthe national security of the United States. As used in this subdivision, national security means the national defense foreign relations of the United\n\nStates and specifically includes: a military or defense advantage over any\nforeign nation or group of nations; a favorable foreign relations position; or\na defense posture capable of successfully resisting hostile or destructive\naction from within or without, overt or covert. (c) Memorandum. If continued\npretrial confinement is approved, the commander must prepare a written\nmemorandum which states the reasons for the conclusion that the requirements\nfor confinement in clause (b) of this subparagraph have been met. This\nmemorandum may include hearsay and may incorporate by reference other documents\nsuch as witness statements, investigative reports, or official records. This\nmemorandum must be forwarded to the reviewing officer under paragraph (9) of\nthis subdivision. If such a memorandum was prepared by the commander before\nordering confinement, a second memorandum need not be prepared. However, additional information may be added to the memorandum at any time. (9)\n\nProcedures for\nreview of pretrial confinement. (i) In\ngeneral. A review of the adequacy of probable cause to believe the prisoner has\ncommitted an offense and of the necessity for continued pretrial confinement\nmust be made within seven days of the imposition of confinement. (ii)\n\nBy whom made. The review under this\nparagraph must be made by a neutral and detached officer appointed by the\nsenior commander of the unit to which the prisoner was assigned at the time of\nthe alleged commission of the offense. (iii)\n\nNature of review. (a) Matters considered. The review under this\nparagraph must include a review of the memorandum submitted by the prisoner's\ncommander under clause (8)(ii)(c) of this subdivision. Additional written\nmatters may be considered, including any submitted by the accused. The\nprisoner, and the prisoner's counsel, if any, must be allowed to appear before\nthe reviewing officer and make a statement, if practicable. A representative of\nthe command may appear before the reviewing officer to make a\nstatement. (b) Rules of evidence. Except for Mil. R. Evid., section V (Privileges) and Mil. R. Evid. 302 and 305, the Military Rules of Evidence do not apply to the matters\nconsidered. (c) Standard of proof. The requirements for confinement under clause (8)(ii)(b) of this subdivision\nmust be proved by a preponderance of the evidence. (iv)\n\nExtension of time limit. The reviewing\nofficer may, for good cause, extend the time limit for completion of the\ninitial review to 10 days after the imposition of pretrial\nconfinement. (v) Action by\nreviewing officer. Upon completion of review, the reviewing officer must\napprove continued confinement or order immediate release. (vi)\n\nMemorandum. The reviewing officer's\nconclusions, including the factual findings on which they are based, must be\nset forth in a written memorandum. A copy of the memorandum and of all\ndocuments considered must be maintained and provided to the accused or the\ngovernment on request. (vii)\n\nReconsideration of approval of continued confinement. The reviewing officer\nmust, after notice to the parties, reconsider the decision to confine the\nprisoner upon request based upon any significant information not previously\nconsidered. (10)\n\nReview\nby military judge. Once the charges for which the accused has been confined are\nreferred to trial, the military judge must review the propriety of pretrial\nconfinement upon motion for appropriate relief. (i) Release. The military judge must order\nrelease from pretrial confinement only if: (a) the reviewing officer's decision was an\nabuse of discretion and there is not sufficient information presented to the\nmilitary judge justifying continuation of pretrial confinement under clause\n(8)(ii)(b) of this subdivision; (b) information not presented to the reviewing officer establishes that the\nprisoner should be released under clause (8)(ii)(b) of this subdivision; or\n(c) the provisions of\nsubparagraphs (9)(ii) or (iii) of this subdivision have not been compiled with\nand information presented to the military judge does not establish sufficient\ngrounds for continued confinement under clause (8)(ii)(b) of this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nCredit. The military judge must order administrative credit under paragraph\n(11) of this subdivision for any pretrial confinement served as a result of an\nabuse of discretion or of failure to comply with the provisions of paragraphs\n(6), (8), or (9) of this subdivision. (11)\n\nRemedy. The remedy for noncompliance\nwith paragraphs (6), (8), (9), or (10) of this subdivision is an administrative\ncredit against the sentence adjudged for any confinement served as the result\nof such noncompliance. Such credit is computed at the rate of one day credit\nfor each day of confinement served as a result of such noncompliance. This\ncredit is to be applied in addition to any other credit the accused may be\nentitled as a result of pretrial confinement served. This credit is to be\napplied first against any confinement adjudged. If no confinement is adjudged, or if the confinement adjudged is insufficient to offset all the credit to\nwhich the accused is entitled, the credit is to be applied against fine and\nforfeiture of pay, in that order, if adjudged. For purposes of this paragraph, one day of confinement is equal to one day of total forfeiture or a like amount\nof fine. The credit cannot be applied against any other form of\npunishment. (12)\n\nConfinement after\nrelease. No person whose release from pretrial confinement has been directed by\na person authorized in paragraph (7) of this subdivision may be confined again\nbefore completion of trial except upon the discovery, after the order of\nrelease, of evidence of misconduct which, either alone or in conjunction with\nall other available evidence, justifies confinement. (13)\n\nExceptions. (i) Operational necessity. The Chief of Staff\nto the Governor may suspend application of subparagraphs (5)(ii) and (iii), paragraph (6), clauses (8)(ii)(a) and (c), and paragraph (9) of this\nsubdivision to specific units or in specified areas when operational\nrequirements of such units or in such areas would make application of such\nprovisions impracticable. (ii)\n\nAt\nsea. Subparagraphs (5)(ii) and (iii), paragraph (6), clause (8)(ii)(c), and\nparagraph (9) of this subdivision does not apply in the case of a person on\nboard a vessel at sea. In such situations, confinement on board the vessel at\nsea may continue only until the person can be transferred to a confinement\nfacility ashore. Such transfer must be accomplished at the earliest opportunity\npermitted by the operational requirements and mission of the vessel. Upon such\ntransfer the memorandum required by clause (8)(ii)(c) of this subdivision must\nbe transmitted to the reviewing officer under paragraph (9) of this subdivision\nand must include an explanation of any delay in the transfer. (f) Initial\ndisposition. (1)\n\nWho may dispose of offenses. Each commander has discretion to dispose of offenses by members of that\ncommand. Ordinarily the immediate commander of a person accused or suspected of\ncommitting an offense triable by court-martial initially determines how to\ndispose of that offense. A superior commander may withhold the authority to\ndispose of offenses in individual cases, types of cases, or generally. A\nsuperior commander may not limit the discretion of subordinate commander to act\non cases over which authority has not been withheld. (2)\n\nPolicy. Allegations of offenses should be\ndisposed of in a timely manner at the lowest appropriate level of disposition\nlisted in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nHow offenses may be disposed of. Within\nthe limits of the commander's authority, a commander may take the actions set\nforth in this paragraph to initially dispose of a charge or suspected offense. (i) No action. A commander may decide to take\nno action on an offense. If charges have been preferred, they may be\ndismissed. (ii)\n\nAdministrative\naction. A commander may take or initiate administrative action, in addition to\nor instead of other action taken under this subdivision. Administrative actions\ninclude corrective measures such as counseling, admonition, reprimand, exhortation, disap-proval, criticism, censure, reproach, rebuke, extra military\ninstruction, or the administrative withholding of privileges, or any\ncombination of the above. (iii)\n\nNonjudicial punishment. A commander may consider the matter pursuant to ML\n130.15, nonjudicial punishment. See Part 519 of this Title. (iv)\n\nDisposition of charges. Charges may be\ndisposed of in accordance with N.Y.R.C.M. 401. (v) Forwarding for disposition. A commander\nmay forward a matter concerning an offense, or charges, to a superior or\nsubordinate authority for disposition. (4)\n\nNational security matters. If a commander\nnot authorized to convene general courts- martial finds that an offense\nwarrants trial by court-martial, but believes that trial would be detrimental\nto the prosecution of a war or harmful to national security, the matter shall\nbe forwarded to the general court- martial convening authority for action under\nN.Y.R.C.M. 407(b). (g) Preferral of charges. (1)\n\nWho may prefer\ncharges. Any person subject to the code may prefer charges (ML, 130.30[a]). (2)\n\nHow charges are\npreferred; oath. A person who prefers charges must: (i) sign the charges and specifications under\noath before a person described in ML, 131.2, authorized to administer oaths; and\n(ii)\nstate that the signer has\npersonal knowledge of or has investigated the matters set forth in the charges\nand specifications and that they are true in fact to the best of that person's\nknowledge and belief (ML, 130.30[a]). (3)\n\nHow to allege offenses. (i) In general. The format of charge and\nspecification is used to allege violations of the code. (ii)\n\nCharge. A charge states the article of\nthe code, which the accused is alleged to have violated. (iii)\n\nSpecification. A specification is a\nplain, concise, and definite statement of the essential fact constituting the\noffense charged. A specification is sufficient if it alleges every element of\nthe charged offense expressly or by necessary implication. No particular format\nis required. (iv)\n\nMultiple\noffenses. Charges and specifications alleging all known offenses by an accused\nmay be preferred at the same time. Each specification shall state only one\noffense. (v) Multiple offenders. A\nspecification may name more than one person as an accused if each person so\nnamed is believed by the accuser to be a principal in the offense which is the\nsubject of the specification. (4)\n\nHarmless error in citation. Error in or\nomission of the designation of the article of the code or other regulation\nviolated is not a ground for dismissal of a charge or reversal of a conviction\nif the error or omission did not prejudicially mislead the accused. (h) Notification to accused of\ncharges. (1)\n\nImmediate commander. The\nimmediate commander of the accused must cause the accused to be informed of the\ncharges preferred against the accused, and the name of the person who preferred\nthe charges and of any person who ordered the charges to be preferred, if\nknown, as soon as practicable (ML, 130.30[b]). (2)\n\nCommanders at higher echelons. When the\naccused has not been informed of the charges, commanders at higher echelons to\nwhom the preferred charges are forwarded shall cause the accused to be informed\nof the matters required under paragraph (1) of this subdivision as soon as\npracticable. (3)\n\nRemedy. The sole\nremedy for violation of this subdivision is a continuance or recess of\nsufficient length to permit the accused to adequately prepare a defense, and no\nrelief may be granted upon a failure to comply with this subdivision unless the\naccused demonstrates that the accused has been hindered in the preparation of a\ndefense.
