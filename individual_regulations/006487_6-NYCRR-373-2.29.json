Thereafter, the owner or operator shall perform a new determination whenever changes to the\nhazardous waste managed in the tank could potentially cause the maximum organic\nvapor pressure to increase to a level that is equal to or greater than the\nmaximum organic vapor pressure limit for the tank design capacity category\nspecified in clause (2)(i)(\na\n) of this subdivision, as\napplicable to the tank. (ii)\n\nThe\ntank shall be equipped with a fixed roof designed to meet the following\nspecifications: (a) The fixed roof and its\nclosure devices shall be designed to form a continuous barrier over the entire\nsurface area of the hazardous waste in the tank. The fixed roof may be a\nseparate cover installed on the tank (\ne.g., a removable cover\nmounted on an open-top tank) or may be an integral part of the tank structural\ndesign (\ne.g., a horizontal cylindrical tank equipped with a\nhatch). (b) The fixed roof shall be\ninstalled in a manner such that there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or\nother open spaces between roof section joints or between the interface of the\nroof edge and the tank wall. (c) Each opening in the fixed roof, and any manifold system associated with the\nfixed root, shall be either: (1)\nequipped\nwith a closure device designed to operate such that when the closure device is\nsecured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or\nother open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the opening\nand the closure device; or\n(2)\nconnected by a closed-vent system that is vented to a control device. The\ncontrol device shall remove or destroy organics in the vent stream, and shall\nbe operating whenever hazardous waste is managed in the tank except as provided\nfor in items (\ni\n) and (\nii\n) of this subclause. (i) During period when it is necessary to\nprovide access to the tank for performing the activities of item\n(\nii\n) of this subclause, venting of the vapor headspace\nunderneath the fixed roof to the control device is not required, opening of\nclosure devices is allowed, and removal of the fixed roof is allowed. Following\ncompletion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the\nclosure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable, and resume operation of the control device. (ii)\n\nDuring periods of routine inspection, maintenance, or other activities needed for normal operations, and removal of\naccumulated sludge or other residues from the bottom of the tank. (d) The fixed roof and\nits closure devices shall be made of suitable materials that will minimize\nexposure of the hazardous waste to the atmosphere, to the extent practical, and\nwill maintain the integrity of the fixed roof and closure devices throughout\ntheir intended service life. Factors to be considered when selecting the\nmaterials for and designing the fixed roof and closure devices shall include: organic vapor permeability, the effects of any contact with the hazardous waste\nor its vapors managed in the tank; the effects of outdoor exposure to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating practices used for the tank on which\nthe fixed roof is installed. (iii)\n\nWhenever a hazardous waste is in the\ntank, the fixed roof shall be installed with each closure device secured in the\nclosed position except as follows: (a) Opening of closure devices or removal of the fixed roof is allowed at the\nfollowing times: (1)\n\nTo provide access to the\ntank for performing routine inspection, maintenance, or other activities needed\nfor normal operations. Examples of such activities include those times when a\nworker needs to open a port to sample the liquid in the tank, or when a worker\nneeds to open a hatch to maintain or repair equipment. Following completion of\nthe activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure device in\nthe closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable, to the\ntank. (2)\n\nTo remove accumulated\nsludge or other residues from the bottom of tank. (b) Opening of a spring-loaded\npressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure\nrelief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations\nfor the purpose of maintaining the tank internal pressure in accordance with\nthe tank design specifications. The device shall be designed to operate with no\ndetectable organic emissions when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the\ndevice remains in the closed position whenever the tank internal pressure is\nwithin the internal pressure operating range determined by the owner or\noperator based on the tank manufacturer recommendations, applicable\nregulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes\nand practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, ignitable, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials. Examples of normal\noperating conditions that may require these devices to open are during those\ntimes when the tank internal pressure exceeds the internal pressure operating\nrange for the tank as a result of loading operations or diurnal ambient\ntemperature fluctuations. (c) Opening of a safety device, as defined in section\n373-3.29\n(b) of\nthis Part, is allowed at any time conditions require doing so to avoid an\nunsafe condition. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator shall inspect the air emission control equipment in\naccordance with the following requirements. (a) The fixed roof and its closure devices\nshall be visually inspected by the owner or operator to check for defects that\ncould result in air pollutant emissions.
