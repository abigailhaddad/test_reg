  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 860.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adapted\nfrom that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological\nsurvey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a\ndrainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name\nor an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Ramapo River and Mahwah River drainage basins\nmay be illustrated as follows: Water index\nnumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\nNJ\nThe prefix NJ in the waters index number denotes\nstreams entering New Jersey across the New York-New Jersey state line. NJ 12\n\nRamapo River\n\nThe 12th stream crossing the New York-New Jersey\nboundary line proceeding in a northwesterly direction along the boundary. NJ 12-6\n\nStony Brook\n\nThe 6th tributary entering the Ramapo River above\nthe mouth. NJ 12-6-P 1002e\n\nLake Sebago\n\nThe 1002nd pond, lake or reservoir encountered in\nthe biological survey area of the Lower Hudson River watershed. (3)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Passaic-Newark watershed and has been closely followed in connection with\nthe identification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of the\nstream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the\ntime of its survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the newer maps are\ndesignated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., substrib. and subtribs. indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary\nand\nsubtributaries, respectively, shall\nmean any stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any\nother stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries\nor subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated waters shall\ninclude only the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water referenced\nby such waters index number; where tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned\nafter the waters index number, the specifically designated waters shall include\nthe stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water referenced by such waters\nindex number and all tributaries and subtributaries thereof, which are shown on\nthe reference maps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically designated\nwaters are generally known and which may appear on the reference maps. In cases\nof specifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to\nwhich the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I shall mean a brief\nindication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries\nmay include designations of segments or sections of waters to which a\nparticular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also\ninclude any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. (f) Map Ref. No. as appearing in table I means map reference number and indicates\none or more of the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in\npart, on which the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are\nshown. The following maps were produced from original maps which may be\nprocured through the Washington Distribution Section, Geological Survey. Map Ref. No. Name of\nquadrangle\n\nPublished by\n\nEdition\nP-23\n\nSchunemunk, N.Y. U.S. Geological Survey\n1935\nQ-23\n\nRamapo, N.Y.-N.J. U.S. Geological Survey\n1938\n(g) Class\nas appearing in\ntable I, and denoted by the letters AA, A, B, C or D opposite each specifically\ndesignated waters, shall mean class AA, A, B, C or D, as the case may be, as\nset forth in Part 701, supra. (h) Standards\nas appearing\nin table I, and denoted by the letters AA, A, B, C or D opposite each\nspecifically designated waters shall mean the standards of quality and purity\nestablished for class AA, A, B, C or D, as the case may be, as set forth in\n\nPart 701, supra. The symbol (T) appearing after any standard\ndesignation shall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and that the\ndissolved oxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol\n(TS) after any standard designation shall mean that the designated waters are\nsuitable for trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen specification for\ntrout spawning waters shall apply thereto. (i) The term\ntrout\nas used\nin this Part means any fish in the following genera: \"Coregonus\", \"Oncorhynchus\", \"Prosopium\", \"Salmo\", \"Salvelinus\" and \"Thymallus\". (j) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich appear as lines to indicate natural waters on the reference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated in table I, shall be assigned the\nsame classes and standards of quality and purity as the specifically designated\nwaters to which they are directly tributary. (k) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standards as the waters to which it is\ndirectly tributary. (l) The Ramapo\n\nRiver and Mahwah River drainage basins shall be deemed to include the following\nareas: All land and water areas, the natural surface water drainage from which\nis directly or indirectly tributary to the Ramapo River and Mahwah River in new\n\nYork State. (m) In the\nclassification of these streams it is hereby noted that the New Jersey\n\nDepartment of Environmental Protection has classified all the waters in the\nwatershed drainage basin in New Jersey as FW2 as contained in the Water Quality\n\nStandards N.Y.A.C. 7:9-4.1\net seq. dated August 1989. Therefore, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in\nreviewing the plans for water discharges in these drainage basins will take\ninto consideration the potable water supply use of these streams in the State\nof New Jersey. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n860.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
