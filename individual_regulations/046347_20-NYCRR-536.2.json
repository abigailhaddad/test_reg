  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 536.2 - Penalty for substantial omission of tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1145(a)(1)(vi)\n(a) (1)\n\nAny\nperson required to file a return who omits from the total amount of State and\nlocal sales and use taxes required to be shown on a return an amount which is\nin excess of 25 percent of the amount of such taxes required to be shown on the\nreturn shall be subject to a penalty equal to 10 percent of the amount of such\nomission. However, the amount of the omission shall be reduced by that portion\nof the omission which is attributable to the tax treatment of any item by such\nperson if there is or was substantial authority for such treatment, or any item\nwith respect to which the relevant facts affecting the item's tax treatment are\nadequately disclosed in the return or in a statement attached to the\nreturn. (2)\n\nIf the department\ndetermines that such omission was due to reasonable cause and not due to\nwillful neglect, as defined in section\n2392.1\nof this\n\nTitle, it shall waive all of the penalty assessed. (b) (1)\n\nThere is substantial authority for the tax treatment of an item only if the\nweight of the authorities supporting the treatment is substantial in relation\nto the weight of authorities supporting contrary positions. All authorities\nrelevant to the tax treatment of an item, including the authorities contrary to\nthe treatment, are taken into account in determining whether substantial\nauthority exists. The weight of those authorities is determined in light of the\npertinent facts and circumstances in the manner prescribed in paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision. There may be substantial authority for more than one position\nwith respect to the same item. The taxpayer's belief that the authorities with\nrespect to the tax treatment of an item constitute substantial authority is not\ntaken into account in determining whether there is substantial\nauthority. (2)\n\nTypes of authority. In determining whether there is substantial authority\n(other than in cases described in paragraph [4] of this subdivision), only the\nfollowing will be considered authority: applicable provisions of the Tax Law\nand other statutory provisions; regulations of the Commissioner of Taxation and\n\nFinance and regulations proposed by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance\nconstruing such law; court cases; administrative pronouncements (including\ntechnical memoranda); Tax Department and other official explanation of such law\nand regulations; and legislative intent as reflected in bill memoranda. Conclusions reached in treatises, legal periodicals, legal opinions or opinions\nrendered by other tax professionals, and descriptions of statutes prepared\nafter enactment are not authority. The authorities underlying such expressions\nof opinion, where applicable to the facts of a particular case, however, may\ngive rise to substantial authority for the tax treatment of an\nitem. (3)\n\nExcept as\notherwise provided in this subdivision, the weight of the authorities for the\ntax treatment of an item is determined by the same analysis that a court would\nbe expected to follow in evaluating the tax treatment of the item. Thus, the\nweight of authorities depends on their persuasiveness and relevance as well as\ntheir source. For example, a case or a declaratory ruling having some facts in\ncommon with the tax treatment at issue would not be considered particularly\nrelevant if the authority is materially distinguishable on its facts, or is\notherwise inapplicable to the tax treatment at issue. Similarly, an authority\nthat merely states a conclusion ordinarily would be given less weight than an\nauthority that reaches its conclusion by cogently relating the applicable law\nto pertinent facts. There may be substantial authority for the tax treatment of\nan item despite the absence of certain types of authority. Thus, a taxpayer may\nhave substantial authority for a position that is supported only by a\nwell-reasoned construction of the applicable statutory provision. However, a\nposition with respect to the tax treatment of an item that is arguable but\nfairly unlikely to prevail in court would not satisfy the substantial authority\nstandard. (4)\n\nThere is substantial\nauthority for the tax treatment of an item if the treatment is supported by the\nholding of an advisory opinion issued to the taxpayer, by the holding of an\nopinion of counsel in which the taxpayer is named, or by an affirmative\nstatement in a tax auditor's report with respect to a prior audit of the\ntaxpayer (\"written determinations\"). The preceding sentence shall not apply, however, if there has been a misstatement or omission of a material fact, the\nfacts that subsequently develop are materially different from the facts on\nwhich the written determination was based, or authority supporting a contrary\nposition has arisen since the date of the written determination. (5)\n\nFor purposes of this section, there is\nsubstantial authority for the tax treatment of an item if there is substantial\nauthority at the time of the relevant transaction, at the time the return\ncontaining the item is filed or on the last day of the taxable period to which\nthe return relates. (c) (1)\n\nDisclosure is adequate with respect to\nthe tax treatment of an item on a return only if it is made on such return or\nin a statement attached thereto. (2)\n\nDisclosure will be adequate with respect\nto an item (or group of similar items), if it takes the form of a statement\nattached to the return that includes the following: (i) a caption identifying the statement as a\ndisclosure under section\n1145\nof the Tax Law; (ii)\nan identification of the item (or group\nof similar items) with respect to which disclosure is made; (iii)\nthe amount of the item (or group of\nsimilar items); and\n(iv)\nthe facts\naffecting the tax treatment of the item (or group of similar items) that\nreasonably may be expected to apprise the department of the nature of the\npotential controversy concerning the tax treatment of the item (or\nitems). (3)\n\nIn lieu of\nsetting forth the facts affecting the tax treatment of an item (or group of\nsimilar items) in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the\ntaxpayer may set forth a concise description of the legal issue (or issues)\npresented by such facts or a concise description of the taxpayer's legal\nposition (or positions) with respect to the items. (4)\n\nDisclosure is not adequate with respect\nto an item (or group of similar items) if it consists of undifferentiated\ninformation that is not arranged in a manner that reasonably may be expected to\napprise the department of the identity of the item, its amount, and the nature\nof the potential controversy concerning the item (or items). For example, attachment of a statement claiming a refund or credit in a specific amount to a\nreturn but furnishing no other information substantiating the basis of a refund\nor credit will not constitute adequate disclosure of the issues involved in\ndetermining the basis of such refund.
