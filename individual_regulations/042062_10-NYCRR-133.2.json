(4)\n\nThe term watershed means any area naturally draining into any watercourse tributary to any reservoir of the water supply of the city of Newburgh. (5)\n\nThe linear distance of a structure or object from a reservoir or watercourse is the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (6)\n\nThe term human excreta means feces, urine and other excretions, commonly disposed of by the so-called dry system as typified by the ordinary privy. (7)\n\nThe term sewage means waste liquids containing human excreta and decomposing matter flowing in or from a house drainage system or sewer. (c) Human excreta. (1)\n\nNo human excreta shall be deposited, thrown or placed or allowed to escape into any reservoir or any tributary watercourse. (2)\n\nNo human excreta shall be placed or spread upon the surface of the ground at any point on the watershed of the water supply. (3)\n\nNo human excreta shall be buried in the soil on the watershed of the water supply unless deposited in trenches or pits at a distance of not less than 500 feet from any reservoir or any tributary watercourse and covered with not less than 18 inches of soil in such a manner as to effecually prevent its being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow. (4)\n\nNo privy or receptacle of any kind for the storage or deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 50 feet of any reservoir or any tributary watercourse except a properly constructed and operated sewage disposal plant, as hereinafter set forth in subdivision (d), provided, however, that the property on which the privy or receptacle is built or is to be built is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distance above named can be obtained within the limits of such property.

Where removable watertight containers are provided they shall be located as far as practicable from any reservoir or tributary watercourse. All privies or receptacles referred to in this paragraph shall be constructed or installed only with the approval and under the supervision of the water department of the city of Newburgh and in such manner as effectually to prevent any pollution of the public water supply.
