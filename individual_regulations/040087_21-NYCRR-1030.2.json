Masks may be either\nmanufactured or homemade and must be a solid piece of material without slits, exhalation valves, or punctures. Cloth masks should be made with two or more\nlayers of breathable fabric that is tightly woven (i.e., fabrics that do not\nlet light pass through when held up to a light source). Masks may be reusable\nor disposable. Medical masks and N-95 respirators fulfill this requirement. (1)\nmasks worn in a way that does not cover\nthe nose and mouth; (2)\nface\nshields or goggles (though face shields or goggles may be worn to supplement a\nmask that meets the above required attributes); (3)\nscarves, ski masks, balaclavas, or\nbandannas; (4)\nshirt or sweater\ncollars (i.e., turtleneck collars) pulled up over the mouth and nose; (5)\nmasks made from loosely woven fabric or\nthat are knitted (i.e., fabrics that let light pass through); (6)\nmasks made from material that is hard to\nbreathe through (such as vinyl, plastic or leather); and\n(7)\nmasks containing slits, exhalation valves\nor punctures. (c) The\nrequirement to wear a mask shall not apply under the following circumstances: (1)\nwhile eating or drinking for brief\nperiods, but only in locations where eating and drinking otherwise are\npermitted, or while taking medication; prolonged periods of mask removal are\nnot permitted for eating or drinking, the mask must be worn between bites and\nsips; (2)\nwhile communicating with\na person who is hearing impaired when the ability to see the mouth is essential\nfor communication; (3)\nwhile a\nperson is unconscious (for reasons other than sleeping), incapacitated, unable\nto be awakened, or otherwise unable to remove the mask without\nassistance; (4)\nwhen necessary to\ntemporarily remove the mask to verify one's identity or when asked to do so by\nany police officer, peace officer, or authority employee. (d) The following categories of persons are\nnot required to wear a mask: (1)\na child under\nthe age of two years; (2)\na person\nwith a disability who cannot wear a mask, or cannot safely wear a mask, because\nof the disability as defined by the Americans with Disabilities Act; (3)\na person for whom wearing a mask would\ncreate a risk to workplace health, safety, or job duty as determined by\napplicable workplace safety guidelines or Federal\nregulations. (e) Any\nperson who does not comply with the requirement to wear a mask that completely\ncovers their mouth and nose may be barred from entering or remaining on or in\nany terminal, station, train, facility, or conveyance of any authority covered\nby this Part and also may be fined $50 per occurrence. This rule shall be\nenforced by each of the authorities on or in its terminals, stations, trains, facilities, or conveyances by any person authorized by such authority to\nenforce its own rules and pursuant to the procedures established by such\nauthority for enforcing violations of its rules.
