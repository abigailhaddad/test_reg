  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 363.5 - Individuals who need not file an election\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Benefits shall be calculated under the\nprovisions of article 15 with respect to individuals covered by article 14 who, on the effective date of retirement: (1)\nhave\naccrued at least 30 years of service credit; or\n(2)\nhave attained age 60 and who have accrued\nless than 20 years of credited service; or\n(3)\nhave attained age 60 and have accrued at\nleast 25 years of credited service. For these three groups of individuals, the\namount of service or vested retirement benefits payable will always be greater\nunder the provisions of article 15 than they would be under the article 14\ncalculation. Accordingly, benefits payable to these groups of individuals shall\nbe calculated pursuant to the provisions of article 15, and such individuals\nshall not be required to file an election pursuant to this Part. (b) With respect to individuals\nwho, at retirement have attained age 62 and have at least 20, but less than 25\nyears of credited service, the amount of the monthly benefit will not change at\na later date under article 14 or 15. While, for this group the question of\nwhich article will produce the greater benefit can be determined at retirement, the result varies from individual to individual. Accordingly, the Retirement\n\nSystem will use whatever calculation provides the higher benefit for each\nmember of this group, and these individuals shall not be required to elect\nbetween the article 14 and article 15 calculation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n363.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
