  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-3.2 - Taxable year in which income or deduction is included in ENI\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 208(9)(d))\n(a) In general, the method of accounting used\nin computing taxable income for Federal income tax purposes is used in\ncomputing ENI. However, whenever the commissioner deems it necessary in order\nto properly reflect the ENI of the taxpayer, the commissioner may determine the\ntaxable year or period in which any item of income or deduction shall be\nincluded, without regard to the method of accounting used by the taxpayer for\n\nFederal income tax purposes. (b) Examples. Example 1: A taxpayer has a contract for the construction\nof a building and the subsequent installation of equipment in that building. The contract covers a period in excess of one taxable year. The taxpayer keeps\nits books so as to reflect the total income derived from the contract in the\ntaxable year in which the contract is finally completed, and reports its\n\nFederal taxable income accordingly. The commissioner may require the taxpayer\nto report the income from the contract on the basis of the percentage of\ncompletion in each taxable year, or some other appropriate basis. Example 2: A foreign corporation sells its New York\n\nState real estate on an installment basis, and terminates its taxable status in\n\nNew York State in the year of the sale. The full profit on the sale must be\nincluded in entire net income in the year of the sale. Example 3: A foreign corporation sells its New York\n\nState real estate on an installment basis and terminates its taxable status in\n\nNew York State in a subsequent taxable year prior to the receipt of all of its\ninstallment payments. The profit included in the remaining installment payments\nfor the sale must be included in ENI in the year it terminates its taxable\nstatus in New York State. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n3-3.2\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
