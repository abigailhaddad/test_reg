  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5316.19 - Voucher validation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Payment\nby voucher printer. Payment by voucher printer as a method of credit redemption\nshall be permissible only when: (1)\na kiosk is\nlinked to a computerized voucher validation system that allows validation of\nthe printed voucher. Validation approval or information shall come from the\nvoucher-validation system in order to validate vouchers. Vouchers may be\nvalidated at any location, so long as such validation meets the requirements\nset forth in this section. Provisions shall be made if communication is lost\nand validation information cannot be sent to the validation system, thereby\nrequiring the manufacturer to have an alternate method of payment. The\nvalidation system shall be able to identify duplicate vouchers to prevent fraud\nby reprinting and redeeming a voucher that had been issued; or\n(2)\nby use of an approved alternative method\nthat includes the ability to identify duplicate vouchers to prevent fraud by\nreprinting and redeeming a voucher that had been issued. (b) Voucher information. A voucher produced\nby a kiosk shall contain, at a minimum, the following printed information: (1)\ngaming facility name/site identifier (it\nis permissible for this information to be contained on the voucher stock\nitself); (2)\nkiosk identification\nnumber; (3)\ndate and time (24-hour\nformat that is understood by the local date/time format); (4)\nalpha and numeric currency amount of the\nvoucher; (5)\nvoucher sequence\nnumber; (6)\nvalidation number\n(including a copy of the validation number on the leading edge of the\nvoucher); (7)\nbar code or any\nmachine readable code representing the validation number; (8)\ntype of transaction or other method of\ndifferentiating voucher types (assuming multiple voucher types are available). Additionally, whenever the voucher type itself is a non-cashable item and/or\njust a receipt, the voucher explicitly shall express that it has no cash\nvalue; (9)\nindication of an\nexpiration period from date of issue, or date and time the voucher will expire\n(24-hour format that is understood by the local date/time format). It is\npermissible for such information to be contained on the voucher stock itself\n(e.g., \"Expires in one year\"); and\n(10)\nif offline voucher issuance is\nsupported, an offline authentication identifier shall, at a minimum, be printed\non the immediate next line following the leading edge validation number that in\nno way overwrites, or otherwise compromises, the printing of the validation\nnumber on the voucher (not required for vouchers that are non-redeemable at a\ngaming device). The offline authentication identifier shall be derived by a\nhash, or other secure encryption method of at least 128 bits, that uniquely\nwill identify the voucher, verify that the redeeming system was also the\nissuing system and validate the amount of the voucher. Where a suitable\nauthentication identifier is not printed on the voucher, the kiosk shall print, at most, one wagering instrument after the kiosk-to-validation-system\ncommunication has been lost. (c) Validation number or barcode. Information\nset forth in subdivision (b) of this section is permitted to be part of the\nvalidation number or barcode. Multiple barcodes are permitted and may represent\nmore than just the validation number. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5316.19\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 16, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 46, eff. 11/16/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
