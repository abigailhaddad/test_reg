  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1647-4.2 - Classification of replacements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In\naddition to replacements, other expenditures in the nature of repairs, maintenance and renewals (RM&R) may be made to maintain or restore the\nutility, function or revenue producing capacity of a project. Such\nexpenditures, however, are charged to expense, whereas expenditures for\nreplacements are charged to the reserve. Theoretical criteria for\ndistinguishing between RM&R on the one hand, and replacements, on the\nother, have been stated in the preamble to the definitions of the 4400, Repairs\nand Maintenance, group of expense accounts (see Part 1641). In view of the\npractical difficulties in their application, the division does not prescribe\nthe use of such criteria, except as a guide, and bases its classification on a\nsystem of selection and predetermination, as follows: (1)\n\nSchedule of replacement reserve\nrequirements. The first step in the system of classification is the preparation\nby the local agency of a schedule of replacement reserve requirements (see\n§\n1647-4.3\n). This schedule is\nsubmitted for division review and approval upon substantial completion of the\nproject and lists the assets which, it is intended, will be replaced over the\nlife of the project and for which reserves are to be accumulated by periodical\nprovisions. It is evident that, of the aggregate of assets comprising a\nproject, a selection will necessarily have to be made of the assets to be\nincluded in the schedule of replacement reserve requirements, inasmuch as it is\nthe stated purpose of the reserve to provide funds only for such replacements\nas are required to maintain or restore the utility, function or\nrevenue-producing capacity of the project over its statutory life. (2)\n\nOperating budget. The next step in the\nsystem of classification is the preparation of the annual operating budget. Each operating budget submitted to the division for review and approval will\ninclude a supplementary schedule of replacements which shall give a detailed\ndescription and cost estimate of all replacements planned for the budget year. It is evident that, in the preparation of the operating budget, the local\nagency will be guided by the schedule of replacement reserve requirements in\nthat the classes of assets budgeted to be replaced during a given budget year\nwill be selected from the list of assets scheduled to be replaced over the life\nof the project as per the schedule of replacement reserve requirements, as\nrevised to date. In the event that the need for an unanticipated replacement\noccurs during the year, the local agency shall request division approval of a\ncorresponding amendment of the operating budget. (3)\n\nClassification. The final step in the\nsystem of classification is to classify as replacements, to be charged to\naccount 2510, Replacement Reserve, all expenditures for items listed on the\nschedule of replacements with the approved operating budget, as amended, and to\nclassify as RM&R expenses, to be charged to the 4400 group of expense\naccounts, all other expenditures for maintaining or restoring the utility, function and revenue-producing capacity of the project. (b) The division exercises control over the\nclassification of expenditures for repairs, maintenance, renewals and\nreplacements through its approval and periodical review of the schedule of\nreplacement reserve requirements, its review and approval of the annual\noperating budgets and amendments thereto, and its office review and field audit\nof the actual expenditures and classification thereof by the local\nagency.
