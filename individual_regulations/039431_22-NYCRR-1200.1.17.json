(2)\n\nNotwithstanding Rule 1.6, the seller may provide the prospective buyer with\ninformation as to individual clients: (i) concerning the identity of the\nclient, except as provided in paragraph (b)(6); (ii)\nconcerning the status and\ngeneral nature of the matter; (iii)\navailable in public court files; and\n(iv)\nconcerning\nthe financial terms of the client-lawyer relationship and the payment status of\nthe client's account. (3)\n\nPrior to making any disclosure of\nconfidential information that may be permitted under paragraph (b)(2), the\nseller shall provide the prospective buyer with information regarding the\nmatters involved in the proposed sale sufficient to enable the prospective\nbuyer to determine whether any conflicts of interest exist. Where sufficient\ninformation cannot be disclosed without revealing client confidential\ninformation, the seller may make the disclosures necessary for the prospective\nbuyer to determine whether any conflict of interest exists, subject to\nparagraph (b)(6). If the prospective buyer determines that conflicts of\ninterest exist prior to reviewing the information, or determines during the\ncourse of review that a conflict of interest exists, the prospective buyer\nshall not review or continue to review the information unless the seller shall\nhave obtained the consent of the client in accordance with Rule\n1.6(a)(1). (4)\n\nProspective buyers shall maintain the confidentiality of and shall not use any\nclient information received in connection with the proposed sale in the same\nmanner and to the same extent as if the prospective buyers represented the\nclient. (5)\n\nAbsent\nthe consent of the client after full disclosure, a seller shall not provide a\nprospective buyer with information if doing so would cause a violation of the\nattorney-client privilege. (6)\n\nIf the seller has reason to believe\nthat the identity of the client or the fact of the representation itself\nconstitutes confidential information in the circumstances, the seller may not\nprovide such information to a prospective buyer without first advising the\nclient of the identity of the prospective buyer and obtaining the client's\nconsent to the proposed disclosure. (c) Written notice of the sale\nshall be given jointly by the seller and the buyer to each of the seller's\nclients and shall include information regarding: (1)\nthe client's right to retain other\ncounsel or to take possession of the file; (2)\nthe fact that the client's consent\nto the transfer of the client's file or matter to the buyer will be presumed if\nthe client does not take any action or otherwise object within 90 days of the\nsending of the notice, subject to any court rule or statute requiring express\napproval by the client or a court; (3)\nthe fact that agreements between\nthe seller and the seller's clients as to fees will be honored by the\nbuyer; (4)\nproposed\nfee increases, if any, permitted under paragraph (e); and\n(5)\nthe identity and\nbackground of the buyer or buyers, including principal office address, bar\nadmissions, number of years in practice in New York State, whether the buyer\nhas ever been disciplined for professional misconduct or convicted of a crime, and whether the buyer currently intends to resell the practice. (d) When the\nbuyer's representation of a client of the seller would give rise to a waivable\nconflict of interest, the buyer shall not undertake such representation unless\nthe necessary waiver or waivers have been obtained in writing. (e) The fee charged a client\nby the buyer shall not be increased by reason of the sale, unless permitted by\na retainer agreement with the client or otherwise specifically agreed to by the\nclient.
