The\n\"value of the object of the action,\" which shall be assessed based upon the\nrequest for judicial intervention's Commercial Division addendum and the\nallegations contained in the operative pleadings at the time Commercial\n\nDivision assignment is sought, means the value of the suit's intended benefit, the value of the right being protected, or the value of the injury being\naverted, whichever is greatest. (1)\n\nBreach of contract or fiduciary duty, fraud, misrepresentation, business tort\n(e.g., unfair competition), or statutory and/or common law violation where the\nbreach or violation is alleged to arise out of business dealings (e.g., sales\nof assets or securities; corporate restructuring; partnership, shareholder, joint venture, and other business agreements; technology transactions and/or\ncommercial disputes involving or arising out of technology; trade secrets; restrictive covenants; and employment agreements not including claims that\nprincipally involve alleged discriminatory practices); (2)\ntransactions governed by the Uniform\n\nCommercial Code (exclusive of those concerning individual cooperative or\ncondominium units); (3)\ntransactions involving commercial real property, including Yellowstone\ninjunctions and excluding actions for the payment of rent only; (4)\nshareholder derivative actions-without\nconsideration of the monetary threshold; (5)\ncommercial class actions-without\nconsideration of the monetary threshold; (6)\nbusiness transactions involving or\narising out of dealings with commercial banks and other financial\ninstitutions; (7)\ninternal affairs\nof business organizations; (8)\nmalpractice by accountants or actuaries, and legal malpractice arising out of\nrepresentation in commercial matters; (9)\nenvironmental insurance\ncoverage; (10)\ncommercial insurance\ncoverage (e.g., directors and officers, errors and omissions, and business\ninterruption coverage); (11)\ndissolution of corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies, limited\nliability partnerships and joint ventures-without consideration of the monetary\nthreshold; and\n(12)\napplications to\nstay or compel arbitration and affirm or disaffirm arbitration awards and\nrelated injunctive relief pursuant to CPLR article 75 involving any of the\nforegoing enumerated commercial issues. Where the applicable arbitration\nagreement provides for the arbitration to be heard outside the United States, the monetary threshold set forth in subdivision (a) of this section shall not\napply. (c) Non-commercial\ncases\n\nThe following will not be heard in the Commercial Division\neven if the monetary threshold is met: (1)\nsuits to collect professional\nfees; (2)\ncases seeking a\ndeclaratory judgment as to insurance coverage for personal injury or property\ndamage; (3)\nresidential real estate\ndisputes, including landlord-tenant matters, and commercial real estate\ndisputes involving the payment of rent only; (4)\nhome improvement contracts involving\nresidential properties consisting of one to four residential units or\nindividual units in any residential building, including cooperative or\ncondominium units; (5)\n\nExcept where\nthe judgment in the underlying action or proceeding was obtained in the\n\nCommercial Division, proceedings to enforce a judgment regardless of the nature\nof the underlying case; (6)\nfirst-party insurance claims and actions by insurers to collect premiums or\nrescind non-commercial policies; and\n(7)\nattorney malpractice actions except as\notherwise provided in paragraph (b)(8) of this section. (d) Assignment to the Commercial Division\n(1)\n\nWithin 90 days following service of the\ncomplaint, any party may seek assignment of a case to the Commercial Division\nby filing a Request for Judicial Intervention (RJI) that attaches a completed\n\nCommercial Division RJI Addendum certifying that the case meets the\njurisdictional requirements for Commercial Division assignment set forth in\nsubdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of this section. Except as provided in\nsubdivision (e) below, failure to file an RJI pursuant to this subdivision\nprecludes a party from seeking assignment of the case to the Commercial\n\nDivision. (2)\n\nSubject to meeting\nthe jurisdictional requirements of subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of this\nsection and filing an RJI in compliance with subsection (d)(1) above, the\nparties to a contract may consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the\n\nCommercial Division of the Supreme Court by including such consent in their\ncontract. A sample choice of forum provision can be found at Appendix C to\nthese Rules of the Commercial Division. Alternatively, subject to meeting the\njurisdictional and procedural requirements applicable to the Commercial\n\nDivision and the federal courts, the parties to a contract may consent to the\nexclusive jurisdiction of either the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court\nor the federal courts in New York State by including such consent in their\ncontract. An alternative sample choice of forum provision to that effect can\nalso be found at Appendix C to these Rules of the Commercial Division. In\naddition, the parties to a contract may consent to having New York law apply to\ntheir contract, or any dispute under the contract. A sample choice of law\nprovision can be found at Appendix D to these Rules of the Commercial\n\nDivision. (e) Transfer\ninto the Commercial Division. If an RJI is filed within the 90-day period following\nservice of the complaint and the case is assigned to a noncommercial part\nbecause the filing party did not designate the case as \"commercial\" on the RJI, any other party may apply by letter application (with a copy to all parties) to\nthe Administrative Judge, within ten days after receipt of a copy of the RJI, for a transfer of the case into the Commercial Division. Further, notwithstanding the time periods set forth in subdivisions (d) and (e) of this\nsection, for good cause shown for the delay a party may seek the transfer of a\ncase to the Commercial Division by letter application (with a copy to all\nparties) to the Administrative Judge. In addition, a non-Commercial Division\njustice to whom a case is assigned may suasponte request the Administrative\n\nJudge to transfer a case that meets the jurisdictional requirements for\n\nCommercial Division assignment set forth in subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of\nthis section to the Commercial Division. The determinations of the\n\nAdministrative Judge with respect to any letter applications or requests under\nthis subdivision shall be final and subject to no further administrative review\nor appeal. (f) Transfer from\nthe Commercial Division. (1)\n\nIn the\ndiscretion of the Commercial Division justice assigned, if a case does not fall\nwithin the jurisdiction of the Commercial Division as set forth in this\nsection, it shall be transferred to a non-commercial part of the\ncourt. (2)\n\nAny party aggrieved by a\ntransfer of a case to a non-commercial part may seek review by letter\napplication (with a copy to all parties) to the administrative judge within 10\ndays of receipt of the designation of the case to a non-commercial part. The\ndetermination of the administrative judge shall be final and subject to no\nfurther administrative review or appeal. (g) Rules of practice for the Commercial\n\nDivision\n\nUnless these rules of practice for the Commercial Division\nprovide specifically to the contrary, the rules of this Part also shall apply\nto the Commercial Division, except that Rules 7 through 15 shall supersede\nsection\n202.12\n(Preliminary Conference)\nand Rules 16 through 24 shall supersede section\n202.8\n(Motion Procedure) of this\n\nPart. PREAMBLE\nPreamble to Rules 25-33. The Commercial Division operates in accordance with a\nseries of well-crafted rules and principles designed to achieve and promote the\ngoals of efficient and cost-effective case management. These rules stress\norganization, preparation and cooperation as well as the use of innovative\ntechniques where appropriate. Rules 25-33, which address trial preparation and\nprocedure, reflect these important concepts. These trial rules emphasize the\nimportance of pre- trial preparation and remind the practitioner that such\npreparation is an essential element of successfully litigating and conducting a\ncomplex commercial case and trial. Rules 25-33 identify a series of key items\nthat must be addressed or completed before commencing a trial in the Commercial\n\nDivision and include: accurately estimating the length of the trial so that the\ncourt, counsel and parties can properly allocate their time; preparing and\ncommunicating to the court motions in limine in advance of the trial date; reviewing, assembling, and pre-marking exhibits; addressing issues that may\narise in connection with the use of deposition testimony at trial; agreeing on\na schedule for witnesses and the manner in which each witness will testify\n(including giving consideration to direct testimony by affidavit in a non-jury\ntrial); and preparing and negotiating jury instructions and verdict sheets. The\nsuccessful completion and efficiency of the trial depends upon counsel adhering\nto a key component of the Commercial Division rules to meet and confer and\nresolve issues without the need for court intervention. When there is\ncompliance with the rules, the result is an efficient and cost-effective\nproceeding that will ensure that the court's time and attention will be used in\nthe manner in which it is intended and avoid unnecessary delay and unintended\nconsequences. A Model Pretrial Order can be found at Appendix E. It\nserves as a \"tool\" for the Court and counsel. It provides guidance while\nallowing for flexibility to account for the particular case at hand and the\nrules of the Trial Part. Created in 1995, today's Commercial Division of the New\n\nYork State Supreme Court is an efficient, sophisticated, up-to-date court\ndealing with challenging commercial cases. From its inception, the Commercial\n\nDivision has had as its primary goal the cost-effective, predictable and fair\nadjudication of complex commercial cases. By virtue of its specialized subject\nmatter jurisdiction, exceptional judicial expertise, rules and procedures\ndedicated to commercial practice, and commitment to high standards of attorney\nprofessionalism, the Division has established itself at the forefront of\nworldwide commercial litigation in the twenty-first century. (1)\n\nJurisdiction and Judiciary\n\nThe subject matter jurisdiction of the Commercial Division\n- including both substantial monetary thresholds and carefully chosen case\ntypes (see §\n202.70\nand) - is designed to\nensure that it is the forum of resolution of the most complex and consequential\ncommercial matters commenced in New York's courts. Accordingly, the Division's\njudges are chosen for their extensive experience in resolving sophisticated\ncommercial disputes. Unlike jurists in other civil parts in New York's court\nsystem, Commercial Division justices devote themselves almost exclusively to\nthese complex commercial matters. (2)\n\nRules and Procedures\n\nSince its inception, the Commercial Division has\nimplemented rules, procedures and forms especially designed to address the\nunique problems of commercial practice. Such rules have addressed a wide range\nof matters such as proportionality in discovery, optional accelerated\nadjudication, robust expert disclosure, limits on depositions and\ninterrogatories, streamlined privilege logs, special rules concerning entity\ndepositions, model forms to facilitate discovery, expedited resolution of\ndiscovery disputes, simplification of bench trials, time limits on all trials, streamlined presentation of evidence at trials, and a strong commitment to\nearly case disposition through the Division's alternative dispute resolution\nprogram. Equally important, through the work of the Commercial Division\n\nAdvisory Council - a committee of commercial practitioners, corporate in-house\ncounsel and jurists devoted to the Division's excellence - the Commercial\n\nDivision has become a recognized leader in court system innovation, demonstrating an unparalleled creativity and flexibility in development of\nrules and practices. (3)\n\nThe\n\nCommercial Division Bar\n\nFinally, the work of the Commercial Division has prospered\nthrough the strong cooperative spirit of the bar practicing before it. The\nsubject matter jurisdiction of the court, the pace of high-stakes commercial\npractice, the sophistication of the judiciary and the specialized rules of the\n\nDivision require that the practicing bar be held rigorously to a standard of\ncommitment and professionalism of the highest caliber. For example, the failure\nto appear (or the appearance without proper preparation) at scheduled court\ndates, depositions or hearings is generally viewed as highly improper in the\n\nCommercial Division, and can readily result in the imposition of sanctions and\npenalties as permitted under statute and court rule (see, e.g., CPLR 3126; see\nalso 22 NYCRR Part\n130\n). At the same time, the Commercial Division's judiciary\nis strongly committed to the ongoing development of New York's commercial bar\nand, in that spirit, has instituted practices encouraging the participation of\nless experienced members of that bar in substantive and meaningful ways\n(including presentation of motions or examination of witnesses) in matters\nbefore it. In this manner, the Division seeks to ensure the continued\ndevelopment of the highest quality of commercial bar in New York\n\nState. (4)\n\nConclusion\n\"New York is the center of world commerce, the headquarters\nof international finance, the home of America's leading businesses. As such, it\nstrongly needs a modern, well-staffed, properly equipped forum for the swift, fair and expert resolution of significant commercial disputes.\" In 1995, those\nwords introduced the New York State Bar Association's report proposing the\ncreation of the Commercial Division (N.Y. St. Bar Ass'n, A Commercial Court For\n\nNew York). Since then, they have served as the central rationale for the\n\nDivision's commitment to excellence in the administration of the rule of law in\nbusiness in New York. The practice rules of the Commercial Division, set forth\nbelow, are a crucial component of that commitment, and are designed to be a\ndynamic counterpart to the innovative and efficient business practices which\nare so essential to the economic health of our State and\nnation.

If an RJI is filed within the 90-day period following service of the complaint and the case is assigned to a noncommercial part because the filing party did not designate the case as \"commercial\" on the RJI, any other party may apply by letter\napplication\n(with a copy to all parties) to the Administrative Judge, within ten days after receipt of a copy of the RJI, for a transfer of the case into the Commercial Division. Further, notwithstanding the time periods set forth in subdivisions (d) and (e) of this section, for good cause shown for the delay a party may seek the transfer of a case to the Commercial Division by letter\napplication\n(with a copy to all parties) to the Administrative Judge. In addition, a non-Commercial Division justice to whom a case is assigned may suasponte request the Administrative Judge to transfer a case that meets the jurisdictional requirements for Commercial Division assignment set forth in subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of this section to the Commercial Division. The determinations of the Administrative Judge with respect to any letter applications or requests under this subdivision shall be final and subject to no further administrative review or appeal.

The determination of the administrative judge shall be final and subject to no further administrative review or appeal. (g) Rules of practice for the Commercial Division\n\nUnless these rules of practice for the Commercial Division provide specifically to the contrary, the rules of this Part also shall apply to the Commercial Division, except that Rules 7 through 15 shall supersede section\n202.12\n(Preliminary Conference) and Rules 16 through 24 shall supersede section\n202.8\n(Motion Procedure) of this Part. PREAMBLE\nPreamble to Rules 25-33. The Commercial Division operates in accordance with a series of well-crafted rules and principles designed to achieve and promote the goals of efficient and cost-effective case management. These rules stress organization, preparation and cooperation as well as the use of innovative techniques where appropriate. Rules 25-33, which address trial preparation and procedure, reflect these important concepts. These trial rules emphasize the importance of pre-trial preparation and remind the practitioner that such preparation is an essential element of successfully litigating and conducting a complex commercial case and trial. Rules 25-33 identify a series of key items that must be addressed or completed before commencing a trial in the Commercial Division and include: accurately estimating the length of the trial so that the court, counsel and parties can properly allocate their time; preparing and communicating to the court motions in limine in advance of the trial date; reviewing, assembling, and pre-marking exhibits; addressing issues that may arise in connection with the use of deposition testimony at trial; agreeing on a schedule for witnesses and the manner in which each witness will testify (including giving consideration to direct testimony by affidavit in a non-jury trial); and preparing and negotiating jury instructions and verdict sheets. The successful completion and efficiency of the trial depends upon counsel adhering to a key component of the Commercial Division rules to meet and confer and resolve issues without the need for court intervention. When there is compliance with the rules, the result is an efficient and cost-effective proceeding that will ensure that the court's time and attention will be used in the manner in which it is intended and avoid unnecessary delay and unintended consequences. Created in 1995, today's Commercial Division of the New York State Supreme Court is an efficient, sophisticated, up-to-date court dealing with challenging commercial cases. From its inception, the Commercial Division has had as its primary goal the cost-effective, predictable and fair adjudication of complex commercial cases. By virtue of its specialized subject matter jurisdiction, exceptional judicial expertise, rules and procedures dedicated to commercial practice, and commitment to high standards of attorney professionalism, the Division has established itself at the forefront of worldwide commercial litigation in the twenty-first century. (1)\n\nJurisdiction and Judiciary\n\nThe subject matter jurisdiction of the Commercial Division - including both substantial monetary thresholds and carefully chosen case types (see §\n202.70\nand) - is designed to ensure that it is the forum of resolution of the most complex and consequential commercial matters commenced in New York's courts. Accordingly, the Division's judges are chosen for their extensive experience in resolving sophisticated commercial disputes. Unlike jurists in other civil parts in New York's court system, Commercial Division justices devote themselves almost exclusively to these complex commercial matters. (2)\n\nRules and Procedures\n\nSince its inception, the Commercial Division has implemented rules, procedures and forms especially designed to address the unique problems of commercial practice. Such rules have addressed a wide range of matters such as proportionality in discovery, optional accelerated adjudication, robust expert disclosure, limits on depositions and interrogatories, streamlined privilege logs, special rules concerning entity depositions, model forms to facilitate discovery, expedited resolution of discovery disputes, simplification of bench trials, time limits on all trials, streamlined presentation of evidence at trials, and a strong commitment to early case disposition through the Division's alternative dispute resolution program. Equally important, through the work of the Commercial Division Advisory Council - a committee of commercial practitioners, corporate in-house counsel and jurists devoted to the Division's excellence - the Commercial Division has become a recognized leader in court system innovation, demonstrating an unparalleled creativity and flexibility in development of rules and practices. (3)\n\nThe Commercial Division Bar\n\nFinally, the work of the Commercial Division has prospered through the strong cooperative spirit of the bar practicing before it. The subject matter jurisdiction of the court, the pace of high-stakes commercial practice, the sophistication of the judiciary and the specialized rules of the Division require that the practicing bar be held rigorously to a standard of commitment and professionalism of the highest caliber. For example, the failure to appear (or the appearance without proper preparation) at scheduled court dates, depositions or hearings is generally viewed as highly improper in the Commercial Division, and can readily result in the imposition of sanctions and penalties as permitted under statute and court rule (see, e.g., CPLR 3126; see also 22 NYCRR Part\n130\n). At the same time, the Commercial Division's judiciary is strongly committed to the ongoing development of New York's commercial bar and, in that spirit, has instituted practices encouraging the participation of less experienced members of that bar in substantive and meaningful ways (including presentation of motions or examination of witnesses) in matters before it. In this manner, the Division seeks to ensure the continued development of the highest quality of commercial bar in New York State. (4)\n\nConclusion\n\"New York is the center of world commerce, the headquarters of international finance, the home of America's leading businesses. As such, it strongly needs a modern, well-staffed, properly equipped forum for the swift, fair and expert resolution of significant commercial disputes.\" In 1995, those words introduced the New York State Bar Association's report proposing the creation of the Commercial Division (N.Y. St. Bar Ass'n, A Commercial Court For New York). Since then, they have served as the central rationale for the Division's commitment to excellence in the administration of the rule of law in business in New York. The practice rules of the Commercial Division, set forth below, are a crucial component of that commitment, and are designed to be a dynamic counterpart to the innovative and efficient business practices which are so essential to the economic health of our State and nation.
