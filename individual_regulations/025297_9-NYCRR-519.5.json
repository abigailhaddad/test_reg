  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 519.5 - Suspension, vacation, mitigation remission and setting aside\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Clemency. (1)\n\nGeneral. The imposing commander, his or\nher successor-in-command, or the next superior authority may, in accordance\nwith the time prescribed in the MCM: (i) remit or mitigate any part or amount of the unexecuted portion of the\npunishment imposed; (ii)\nmitigate\nreduction in grade, whether executed or unexecuted, to fine, detention or\npay; (iii)\nat any time, suspend\nprobationally any part or amount of the unexecuted portion of the punishment\nimposed; (iv)\nsuspend probationally\na reduction in grade or fine, whether or not executed. An uncollected fine of\npay shall be considered unexecuted. (2)\n\nMeaning of successor-in-command. As used\nin paragraph 134, MCM, a successor-in-command is the officer who has authority\nto impose the same kind and amount of punishment of a member concerned that was\ninitially imposed or was the result of a modification and who: (i) commands the unit to which the punished\nmember is presently assigned; or\n(ii)\nis the commander succeeding to the\ncommand occupied by the imposing commander, provided the member still is of\nthat command. (3)\n\nRecording of action. Any action of suspension, mitigation, remission or setting\naside, taken by an authority will be recorded according to notes 9 and 10, DMNA\nform 1057 (Appendix L-2[A16]) or DMNA form 1059 (Record of Supplementary Action\n\nUnder Article 15) exhibit 3. (b) Suspension. Ordinarily, punishment is\nsuspended to grant a probational period during which a member may show that he\nor she deserves a remission of the remaining suspended punishment. An executed\npunishment of reduction or fine may be suspended only within a period of four\nmonths after the date imposed. Suspension of punishment may not be for a period\nlonger than six months from the suspension date. Further misconduct by the\nmember, within the period of suspension, may be grounds for vacation of the\nsuspended portion of the punishment. (c) Vacation. (1)\nA commander may vacate any suspended\npunishment, provided the punishment is of the type and amount he or she could\nimpose. There is no appeal from a decision to vacate a suspension. The\nfollowing will be recorded according to notes 8 and 9 on DMNA form 1057\n(Appendix L-2[A16]): (i) action vacation a\nsuspension, to include the basis for vacation; (ii)\nwhether or not the member appeared and\nwas provided an opportunity to respond. (2)\n\nUnless the vacation is prior to the\nexpiration of the stated period of suspension, the suspended punishment is\nautomatically remitted without further action. The death, discharge, or\nseparation from service of the member punished prior to the expiration of the\nsuspension automatically remits the suspended punishment. (3)\nA specific act of misconduct resulting in\nvacation of a suspended punishment may also be the basis for the imposition of\nanother section\n130.15\nproceeding. If the suspended punishment is a reduction\nor fine, the member should, unless impracticable, be given an opportunity to\nappear before the officer authorized to vacate the suspension to rebut the\ninformation upon which the proposed vacation is based. The member may be given\nthe opportunity to appear in any case. (4)\n\nIn cases involving punishments other than\nreduction and fine, the member will be informed of the basis of the proposed\nvacation and should be given an opportunity to respond, either orally or in\nwriting. Failure to provide notification and an opportunity to appear or rebut\nthe information may result in the record of punishment being inadmissible in a\nsubsequent court-martial, but will not, by itself, render a vacation action\nvoid. (d) Mitigation. (1)\n\nGeneral. (i) Mitigation is a reduction in either the\nquantity or quality of punishment, e.g., a restriction for 14 days is reduced\nto five days. (ii)\nA fine may be\nmitigated to a lesser amount. (2)\n\nAppropriateness. Mitigation is\nappropriate when: (i) the recipient has, by\nhis or her subsequent good conduct, merited a reduction in the severity of\npunishment; (ii)\nthe punishment\nimposed was disproportionate to the offense of the offender. (3)\n\nLimitation on mitigation. (i) With the exception of reduction in grade, the power to mitigate exists only with respect to a punishment or portion\nthereof which is unexecuted. A reduction in grade may be mitigated to a fine\neven though it has been executed. (ii)\n\nAlthough a suspended punishment may be\nmitigated to a punishment of a lesser quantity or quality (which is also\nsuspended for a period not greater than the remainder of the period for which\nthe punishment mitigated was suspended), it may not, unless the suspension is\nvacated, be mitigated to an unsuspended punishment. (See paragraph [f][3] of\nthis section for the time period within which reduction ordinarily may be\nmitigated, if appropriate, to a fine). (e) Remission. This is an action whereby any\nportion of the unexecuted punishment is cancelled. Remission is appropriate\nunder the same circumstances as mitigation. An unsuspended reduction is\nexecuted upon imposition and thus cannot be remitted, but may be mitigated or\nset aside. The death, discharge, or separation from the service of a member\npunished remits any unexecuted punishment. A member punished under section\n130.15\nwill not be held beyond his or her expiration of term of service (ETS)\nto complete any unexecuted punishment. (f) Setting aside and restoration. (1)\n\nThis is an action whereby the punishment\nor any part or amount, whether executed or unexecuted, is set aside and any\nrights, privileges or property affected by the portion of the punishment set\naside are restored. The basis for this action is a determination that, under\nall the circumstances of the case, the punishment has resulted in a clear\ninjustice. Clear injustice means that there exists evidence usually newly\ndiscovered, clearly exculpating the member. Normally the member's unsupported\nsworn statement will not constitute clearly exculpating evidence. The fact that\nthe member's performance of service has been exemplary subsequent to the\npunishment does not constitute a \"clear injustice\". (2)\n\nIn cases where administrative error\nresults in incorrect entries on DMNA form 1057, the appropriate remedy is\ngenerally an administrative correction of the form and not a setting aside of\nthe punishment. (3)\n\nThe power to\nset aside an executed punishment and to mitigate a reduction in grade to a\nfine, absent unusual circumstances, will be exercised only within four months\nafter the punishment has been executed. When a commander sets aside any portion\nof the punishment, he or she will record the basis for this action according to\nnotes 8 and 9, DMNA form 1057 (Appendix L-2[A16]) or DMNA form 1059 (Appendix\nL-2[A18]).
