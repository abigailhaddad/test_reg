  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 645-7.4 - Penalty for nonpayment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any\nperson failing to pay to the commission an annual regulatory fee, or any\ninstallment thereof, within 30 days of the date from which such fee is due and\npayable, must pay a penalty. (b) The penalty assessed under this section shall be two percent of the deficiency\nper month or any part of a month. (c) The penalty required pursuant to this\nsection shall not be imposed during the period in which a regulatory fee is\nbeing disputed pursuant to the procedures provided in this Part, provided that\nthe entire undisputed portion of the regulatory fee is paid in full within 30\ndays after the regulatory fee becomes due and payable. If a person disputing a\nregulatory fee fails to pay the undisputed portion of the fee, then a penalty\nshall be assessed for the entire amount of the fee which is determined to be\ndue and payable. (d) In the event\nthat a person pays the undisputed portion of a penalty pending a request for\nreconsideration of the fee, no penalty shall be assessed on the disputed amount\nuntil 30 days after the request for redetermination is finally determined by\nthe commission. For the purpose of this section, the matter shall be deemed\nfinally determined when the procedures provided for in section 645- 7.5 of this\n\nSubpart have been exhausted. (e) The penalty assessed pursuant to this section is final and irrevocable unless: (1)\nthe person against whom the penalty was\nassessed mails by certified mail or hand delivers to the commission within 30\ndays of the date of the assessment a written request for reconsideration of the\npenalty; or\n(2)\nthe commission\nindependently redetermines the penalty. Any such request must set forth the basis for the failure\nto pay the fee. The commission shall have the authority to rescind or reduce a\npenalty upon a finding that the failure to pay the fee was based upon\nreasonable cause, and was not willful, due to neglect or other reasonable\ncause.
