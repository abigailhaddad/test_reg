  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7910.8 - Program loans\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. The interest rates on loans proposed to be made by a financing institution\nshall be reviewed by the Energy Office. The Energy Office, in its discretion, may refuse to issue interest subsidies on loans which are proposed to be made\nat rates determined by the Energy Office to be unreasonably high after\nconsidering prevailing market rates, interest rates on other program loans, and\nthe class of the loan. (b) Payment\nschedules. Program loans shall contain one of the following types of payment\nschedules: (1)\n\nFully amortized. Payment of\nthe loan, including principal and interest, is made in equal\ninstallments. (2)\n\nFixed principal\npayment loans. Payment of the loan is made in equal payments of principal, plus\ninterest. As interest decreases because of the declining principal balance, the\ntotal payment decreases while the amount applied to principal remains the\nsame. (3)\n\nAlternatives. The Energy\n\nOffice, in its discretion, may agree to issue interest subsidies on loans which\ncontain alternative payment schedules. Interest subsidies on loans with\nalthernative payment schedules shall be calculated in accordance with section\n7910.3\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (c) Per-project\ncap. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision, no energy conservation improvement project may receive an\ninterest subsidy or subsidies on loan amounts greater than $500,000, although\nthe amount of the loan may exceed $500,000. (2)\n\nOnsite power production projects which\notherwise meet the requirements of this Part may receive an interest subsidy or\nsubsidies on loan amounts no greater than $1 million, although the amount of\nthe loan may exceed $1 million. (d) Per-applicant cap. Applicants may apply\nfor interest subsidies under the program in connection with more than one\neligible building. The total of all loans subsidized under this program for any\nsingle applicant may not exceed $1 million; provided, however, that any amount\nin excess of $500,000 must be attributable to the implementation of an onsite\npower production project. (e) Construction loans. For construction loans in which the principal amount is\npaid to the applicant by the financing institution in installments as work\nprogresses, the interest subsidy will not be paid for any period of time prior\nto the payment by the financing institution of the final installment. (f) Completion of work. Work on energy\nconservation improvement projects which receive an interest subsidy must be\ncompleted within six months of the program loan closing. The Energy Office may\nextend this period on a case-by-case basis where the applicant has demonstrated\nreasonable cause for the delay. (g) Loan closing. Program loans shall be made by a financing institution only after\nthe applicant and financing institution receive written notification from the\n\nEnergy Office approving both the application and the terms of the financing\ninstitution's loan commitment, and stating the amount of the interest subsidy\nwhich will be paid by the Energy Office. (h) Principal reductions. The commissioner\nmay, in his discretion, use monies appropriated to the program for the purpose\nof providing principal reductions on program loans, where the terms and\nconditions applicable to such appropriated funds allow for such use. (i) Default on loan. Except as otherwise\nprovided for in this subdivision, where a borrower defaults on a program loan, interest subsidies will be terminated and any interest subsidy payments being\nheld by the financing institution will be returned to the Energy Office. The\nfinancing institution shall notify the Energy Office of the default within 30\ncalendar days of its occurrence. The Energy Office may, in its discretion, authorize the financing institution to continue to receive interest subsidies\non behalf of the borrower for an agreed-upon period of time while the financing\ninstitution works out a revised payment schedule with the borrower. If\ncontinued interest subsidies are authorized by the Energy Office and loan\npayments are not resumed by the borrower within 90 days of the initial default, then all subsidy payments will be terminated immediately. Where a new payment\nschedule is established between the banking organization and the borrower\nwithin the designated time period, the total interest subsidy originally\napproved by the Energy Office will remain unchanged. However, the Energy Office\nmay establish a revised schedule of interest subsidy payments on behalf of the\nborrower. (j) Prepayment of loan. In the event of the prepayment of a program loan, the financing institution\nwill be required to promptly return any unapplied portion of the interest\nsubsidy being held by the financing institution to the Energy Office. (k) Changes in scope of work. The applicant\nshall promptly provide written notice to the Energy Office of any changes in\nenergy conservation improvements to be implemented which differ from the\nprogram application submitted to the Energy Office. Loan subsidies will not be\nprovided by the Energy Office unless such changes are approved by the Energy\n\nOffice. (l) Change in project cost. The applicant shall promptly provide written notice to the Energy Office of any\nchange in the cost of an energy conservation improvement project which differs\nfrom the selected contractor's cost estimate, or the applicant's schedules and\nselected estimate in the case of an in-house project submitted to the Energy\n\nOffice, by either more than 10 percent or $20,000. Based on such changed costs, the Energy Office may adjust the interest subsidy as follows: (1)\n\nIf the project cost is increased and the\napplicant requests an increase in the amount of the program loan, the interest\nsubsidy may be increased, provided the approved applicant provides a\nsatisfactory justification for the project cost increase to the Energy Office\nprior to beginning or continuing work on the energy conservation improvement\nproject. (2)\n\nIf the project cost is\ndecreased, the interest subsidy may be decreased to reflect any reduction in\nthe amount of the program loan; provided, however, that under no circumstances\nwill interest subsidies be paid on program loan proceeds which exceed the cost\nof the project. (m) Utility financial incentives. The approved applicant shall promptly provide\nwritten notice to the Energy Office of its receipt of a financial incentive\nfrom its utility company for the energy conservation improvements funded under\nthis program. The amount of any incentive received shall be deducted from the\nproject cost to arrive at a net project cost, and the amount of the interest\nsubsidy shall be recalculated based on the net project cost.
