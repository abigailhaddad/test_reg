Tit. 11 § 44.10 - Examples\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis section contains examples of the application of market-value adjustment formulae that meet the requirements of this regulation. MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENT EXAMPLES\nVariables\nx\nA\nt\n= Actual Accumulation Amount at time t derived from contribution made at time x\nW\nt\n= Withdrawal Charge Factor at time t\nCSB\nt\n= Cash Surrender Benefit at time t\n(a) Single premium contracts. (1)\n\nInternal index. Example 1: Five-year guaranteed interest rate contract. Assume a contract issued three years ago with a five-year guaranteed interest rate of 12%. Currently, two-year single premium contracts are issued with a two-year guaranteed interest rate of 10%. The current cash surrender benefit is determined to be: (i) CSB\n3\n= (1 W\n3\n) 0\nA\n3 x\n1.122\n/\n1.102\n\nAlternatively: (ii)\nCSB\n3\n= (1 W\n3\n)(0\nA\n3)[1 (.10.12) x 2]\nExample 2: Five-year guaranteed interest rate contract with cap. Assume a contract issued three years ago with a guaranteed interest rate of 12% in years 1-5, and a minimum interest guarantee of 5% in years 6-10. There is a 5% cap on market value adjustments. Currently, two-year guaranteed interest rates of 8% are being offered on similar contracts. The current cash surrender benefit is determined to be: CSB\n3\n= (1 W\n3\n)0\nA\n3 x\n1.122\n/\n1.082\ncap of 5%\n= (1 W\n3\n) 0\nA\n3 * 1.05\n(2)\n\nExternal index. Example 3: Five-year guaranteed interest rate contract. Assume a contract issued two-years ago with a five-year guaranteed interest rate of 9%. At issue, the yield to maturity on five-year Treasury bills was 10%. Currently, three -year Treasury bills are yielding 12% to maturity. The current cash surrender benefit is determined to be: (i) CSB\n2\n= (1 W\n2\n)0\nA\n2 x\n1.10 3\n/\n1.123\n\nAlternatively: (ii)\nCSB\n2\n= (1 W\n2\n)(0\nA\n2)[1 (.12.10) * 3]\n(b) Flexible premium contracts. (1)\n\nInternal index. Example 4: Five-year flexible premium guaranteed interest rate contract. Assume a contract issued three years ago, and the guaranteed interest rates to maturity (five years from issue) associated with deposits made during the first three contract years are as follows: Time of deposit\n\nGuaranteed interest rate to maturity\n0\n10%\n1\n9%\n2\n9%\nCurrently, two-year flexible premium contracts are issued with a guaranteed interest rate to maturity of 81/2% on first-year deposits. The current cash surrender benefit is determined to be: (i) CSB\n3\n= (1 W\n3\n)(0\nA\n3 x\n1.102\n/\n1.0852\n+ 1\nA\n3 x\n1.092\n/\n1.0852\n+ 2\nA\n3 x\n1.092)\n/\n1.0852\n\nAlternatively: (ii)\n\nLet i\navg\n=\n0A3 *.10 + 1A3 *.09 + 2A3 *.09\n/\n0A3 +1A3 + 2A3\n\nThen: CSB\n3\n= [(1 W\n3\n) x ((0\nA\n3 + 1\nA\n3 + 2\nA\n3) x (1 + i\navg\n)\n2\n)]/(1.085)\n2\n\nExample 5: Five-year flexible premium, flexible maturity guaranteed interest rate contract. Assume a contract issued three years ago, and the guaranteed interest rates to maturity (five years from deposit) associated with deposits made during the first three contract years are as follows: Time of deposit\n\nGuaranteed interest rate to maturity\n0\n10%\n1\n10%\n2\n11%\nCurrently, the following guaranteed interest rates are offered on deposits to new issues of similar contracts: Years to maturity\n\nGuaranteed interest rate to maturity\n2\n8%\n3\n9%\n4\n10%\nThe current cash surrender benefit is determined to be: (i) CSB\n3\n= (1 W\n3\n)(0\nA\n3 x\n1.102\n/\n1.082\n+ 1\nA\n3 x\n1.103\n/\n1.093\n+ 2\nA\n3 x\n1.114)\n/\n1.104\n(ii)\nCSB\n3\n= (1 W\n3\n)[(0\nA\n3)[1 (.08.10) * 2]\n+ (1\nA\n3)[1 (.09.10) x 3]\n+ (2\nA\n3)[1 (.10.11) x 4]]\nAlternatively: Let n\navg\n=\n(0A3 x 2) + (1A3 x 3) + (2A3 x 4)\n/\n(0A3 + 1A3 + 2A3\n\nAssume n\navg\n= 3, Then: (iii)\nCSB\n3\n= (1 W\n3\n)(0\nA\n3 x 1.10\n3\n+ 1\nA\n3 x 1.10\n3\n+ 2\nA\n3 x 1.11\n3\n)/1.093\n(2)\n\nExternal index. Example 6: Five-year flexible premium guaranteed interest rate contract. Assume a contract issued three years ago with a five-year guaranteed interest rate of 9%. The yield to maturity on Treasury bills during this period was as follows: Time\n\nYears to maturity\nT-bill yield to maturity\n0\n5\n10%\n1\n4\n9%\n2\n3\n9%\nCurrently, two-year Treasury bills are yielding 81/2% to maturity. The current cash surrender benefit is determined to be: CSB\n3\n= (1 W\n3\n)(0\nA\n3x\n1.102\n/\n1.0852\n+ 1\nA\n3 x\n1.092\n/\n1.0852\n+ 2\nA\n3 x\n1.092)\n/\n1.085 2\n\nExample 7: Five-year flexible premium, flexible maturity guaranteed interest rate contract. Assume the same facts as in example 6, and further assume that the following market values of $1,000, semiannual coupon Treasury bills are known: Time\n\nYears to maturity\n\nAnnual coupon rate\n\nMarket value\n0\n5\n10%\n$1,000\n1\n5\n10%\n$1,000\n2\n5\n11%\n$1,000\n3\n2\n10%\n$1,100\n3\n3\n10%\n$1,100\n3\n4\n11%\n$1,200\n\nThe current cash surrender benefit is determined to be: CSB\n3\n= (1 W\n3\n)(0\nA\n3 x\n1100\n/\n1000\n+ 1\nA\n3 x\n1100\n/\n1000\n+ 2\nA\n3 x\n1200)\n/\n1000\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
