  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 246.8 - Initial monitoring certification and recertification procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) the owner or\noperator of a MRP unit shall be exempt from the initial certification\nrequirements of this section for a monitoring system under section\n246.7\n(a)(1)\nif the\nfollowing conditions are met: (1)\nthe\nmonitoring system has been previously certified in accordance with 40 CFR part\n75; and\n(2)\nfor continuous emission\nmonitoring systems, the applicable quality- assurance and quality-control\nrequirements of\n40 CFR\n75.21\nand 40 CFR\n75\n\nAppendix B are fully met\nfor the certified monitoring system described in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision; or\n(3)\nfor sorbent\ntrap monitoring system, the applicable quality-assurance and quality- control\nrequirements of\n40 CFR\n75.15, 40 CFR\n75.20(c)(9), in section\n6.5.7. of Appendix A of\n40 CFR\n75, 40 CFR\n75 Appendix K, and 40 CFR\n75\n\nAppendix\nB sections 1.5 and\n2.3\nof are fully met for the\ncertified monitoring system. (b) The recertification provisions of this\nsection shall apply to a monitoring system which is exempt from initial\ncertification requirements under subdivision (a) of this section. (c) Except as provided in subdivision (a) of\nthis section, the owner or operator of a MRP unit shall comply with the\nfollowing initial certification and recertification procedures for a continuous\nmonitoring system (i.e., a continuous emission monitoring system and sorbent\ntrap monitoring system under\n40 CFR\n75.15\n). The owner or operator of a unit that\nqualifies to use the Hg low mass emissions excepted monitoring methodology\nunder 40 CFR\n75.81(b)\nor that also qualifies to use an alternative monitoring\nsystem under 40 CFR\n75\nsubpart E shall comply with the procedures in\nsubdivision (d) or (e) of this section respectively. (1)\n\nRequirements for initial certification. The owner or operator shall ensure that each continuous monitoring system under\nsection\n246.7\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Part (including the automated data acquisition and handling system)\nsuccessfully completes all of the initial certification testing required under\n40 CFR\n75.20\nby the applicable deadline in section\n246.7(b) of this Part. In addition, whenever the owner or operator installs a\nmonitoring system to meet the requirements of this section in a location where\nno such monitoring system was previously installed, initial certification in\naccordance with\n40 CFR\n75.20\nis required. (2)\n\nRequirements for recertification. (i) Whenever the owner or operator makes a\nreplacement, modification, or change in any certified continuous emission\nmonitoring system, or sorbent trap monitoring system under\n40 CFR\n75.15, that may significantly affect the\nability of the system to accurately measure or record Hg mass emissions or heat\ninput rate or to meet the quality-assurance and quality-control requirements of\n40 CFR\n75.21\nor 40 CFR\n75\n\nAppendix B, the owner or\noperator shall recertify the monitoring system in accordance with\n40 CFR\n75.20. (ii)\n\nWhenever the owner or operator makes a\nreplacement, modification, or change to the flue gas handling system or the\nunit's operation that may significantly change the stack flow or concentration\nprofile, the owner or operator shall recertify each continuous emission\nmonitoring system and each sorbent trap monitoring system under\n40 CFR\n75.15, whose accuracy is potentially affected\nby the change, in accordance with\n40 CFR\n75.20. Examples of changes to a continuous\nemission monitoring system that require recertification include replacement of\nthe analyzer, complete replacement of an existing continuous emission\nmonitoring system, or change in location or orientation of the sampling probe\nor site. (3)\n\nApproval\nprocess for initial certification and recertification. Subparagraphs (i)\nthrough (iv) of this paragraph apply to both initial certification and\nrecertification of a continuous monitoring system under section\n246.7\n(a)(1). For\nrecertification, replace the words \"certification\" and \"initial certification\"\nwith the word \"recertification\", replace the word \"certified\" with the word\n\"recertified\", and follow the procedures in\n40 CFR\n75.20(b)(5)\nin lieu of the\nprocedures in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph. (i) Notification of certification. The owner\nor operator of the MRP facility shall submit to the department, the EPA Region\n2 Regional Office, and the administrator written notice of the dates of\ncertification testing, in accordance with section\n246.10\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nCertification application. The owner or\noperator of a MRP facility shall submit to the department a certification\napplication for each monitoring system. A complete certification application\nshall include the information specified in\n40 CFR\n75.63. (iii)\n\nProvisional certification date. The\nprovisional certification date for a monitoring system shall be determined in\naccordance with\n40 CFR\n75.20(a)(3). A provisionally\ncertified monitoring system may be used under the Mercury Reduction Program for\na period not to exceed 120 days after receipt by the department of the complete\ncertification application for the monitoring system under subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph. Data measured and recorded by the provisionally certified\nmonitoring system, in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR part\n75, will\nbe considered valid quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time of\nprovisional certification), provided that the department does not invalidate\nthe provisional certification by issuing a notice of disapproval within 120\ndays of the date of receipt of the complete certification application by the\ndepartment. (iv)\n\nCertification\napplication approval process. The department will issue a written notice of\napproval or disapproval of the certification application to the owner or\noperator within 120 days of receipt of the complete certification application\nunder subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. In the event the department does not\nissue such a notice within such 120-day period, each monitoring system that\nmeets the applicable performance requirements of 40 CFR part\n75\nand is included\nin the certification application will be deemed certified for use under the\n\nMercury Reduction Program. (a) Approval\nnotice. If the certification application is complete and shows that each\nmonitoring system meets the applicable performance requirements of 40 CFR part\n75, then the department will issue a written notice of approval of the\ncertification application within 120 days of receipt. (b) Incomplete application notice. If the\ncertification application is not complete, then the department will issue a\nwritten notice of incompleteness that sets a reasonable date by which the owner\nor operator of the MRP facility must submit the additional information required\nto complete the certification application. If the owner or operator of the MRP\nfacility does not comply with the notice of incompleteness by the specified\ndate, then the department may issue a notice of disapproval under clause (c) of\nthis subparagraph. The 120- day review period shall not begin before receipt of\na complete certification application. (c) Disapproval notice. If the certification\napplication shows that any monitoring system does not meet the performance\nrequirements of 40 CFR part\n75\nor if the certification application is\nincomplete and the requirement for disapproval under clause (b) of this\nsubparagraph is met, then the department will issue a written notice of\ndisapproval of the certification application. Upon issuance of such notice of\ndisapproval, the provisional certification is invalidated by the department and\nthe data measured and recorded by each uncertified monitoring system shall not\nbe considered valid quality-assured data beginning with the date and hour of\nprovisional certification (as defined under\n40 CFR\n75.20\n[a][3]). The owner or operator shall\nfollow the procedures for loss of certification in subparagraph (v) of this\nparagraph for each monitoring system that is disapproved for initial\ncertification. (d) Audit\ndecertification. The department may issue a notice of disapproval of the\ncertification status of a monitor in accordance with section\n246.9\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (v) Procedures for\nloss of certification. If the department issues a notice of disapproval of a\ncertification application under clause (iv)(c) of this paragraph or a notice of\ndisapproval of certification status under clause (iv)(d) of this paragraph, the\nfollowing provisions apply: (a) The owner or\noperator shall substitute the following values, for each disapproved monitoring\nsystem, for each hour of unit operation during the period of invalid data\nspecified under\n40 CFR\n75.20(a)(4)(iii)\nor\n75.21(e)\nand continuing until the applicable date and hour specified under of\n40 CFR\n75.20(a)(5)(i): (1)\n\nFor a disapproved mercury pollutant\nconcentration monitor and disapproved flow monitor, respectively, the maximum\npotential concentration of mercury and the maximum potential flow rate, as\ndefined in sections of 40 CFR part\n75\n\nAppendix A, 2.1.7.1 and\n2.1.4.1. (2)\n\nFor a disapproved\nmoisture monitoring system and disapproved diluent gas monitoring system, respectively, the minimum potential moisture percentage and either the maximum\npotential CO\n2\nconcentration or the minimum potential O\n2\nconcentration (as applicable), as defined in sections\nof 40 CFR part\n75\n\nAppendix A, 2.1.5, 2.1.3.1, and 2.1.3.2. (3)\n\nFor a disapproved sorbent trap monitoring\nsystem under\n40 CFR\n75.15\nand disapproved flow monitor, respectively, the maximum potential concentration of mercury and maximum\npotential flow rate, as defined in sections of 40 CFR part\n75\n\nAppendix A, 2.1.7.1 and 2.1.4.1. (b) The owner or operator of the MRP facility shall submit a notification of\ncertification retest dates and a new certification application in accordance\nwith subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph. (c) The owner or operator shall repeat all\ncertification tests or other requirements that were failed by the monitoring\nsystem, as indicated in the department's notice of disapproval, no later than\n30 unit operating days after the date of issuance of the notice of\ndisapproval. (d) Initial\ncertification and recertification procedures for units using the Hg low mass\nemission excepted methodology under 40 CFR\n75.81(b). The owner or operator of a\nunit qualified to use the Hg low mass emissions (HgLME) excepted methodology\nunder 40 CFR\n75.81(b)\nshall meet the applicable certification and\nrecertification requirements in 40 CFR\n75.81(c)\nthrough (f). (e) Certification/recertification procedures\nfor alternative monitoring systems.
