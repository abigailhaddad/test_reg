  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 860.4 - Effluent quality requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Minimum treatment. All wastes shall receive a minimum of secondary treatment, regardless of the stated stream quality objective. (b) Disinfection. Wastes (exclusive of\nstormwater bypass) containing human excreta or disease-producing organisms\nshall be effectively disinfected before being discharged into surface bodies of\nwater as needed to meet applicable commission or State water quality\nstandards. (c) Public safety. Effluents shall not create a menace to public health or safety at the point of\ndischarge. (d) Limits. (1)\n\nDischarges shall not contain more than\nnegligible amounts of debris, oil, scum, or other floating materials, suspended\nmatter which will settle to form sludge, toxic substances, or substances or\norganisms that produce color, taste, odor of the water, or taint fish or\nshellfish flesh. (i) Suspended solids. (a) For wastewater treatment facilities, not\nto exceed: (1)\n30 mg/l as a 30-day average; and\n(2)\n45 mg/l as a 7-day\naverage. (b) For\nindustrial wastewater treatment facilities' discharges with a concentration\ngreater than in subclauses (a)(1)-(2) of this subparagraph: (1)\nup to 100 mg/l as a 30-day average may be\npermitted; and\n(2)\nat least 85\npercent reduction as a 30-day average is achieved, as may be modified by\nsection\n860.6\n(d)(3)\nof\nthis Part. (c) The limit\nin subclause (b)(1) of this subparagraph may be waived upon application, if it\nis determined that there is an established USEPA best conventional pollutant\ncontrol technology (BCT) effluent limitation and that the treatment level meets\nthe applicable BCT limitation. (ii)\n\nOil and grease. (a) Oil storage terminal runoff. (1)\n\nOil storage terminal runoff shall not\nexhibit readily visible oil. (2)\n\nControl facilities shall be designed and operated such that the concentration\nof oil and grease in the effluent shall not exceed 15 mg/l as the average of\nsamples taken during any single storm event during which: (i) precipitation is not greater than two\ninches per hour or 4 1/2 inches in 24 hours; or\n(ii)\na maximum runoff of 80 gallons per\nminute per acre over a 24-hour period occurs. (3)\n\nIn implementing this standard, signatory\nparties may adopt and apply either effluent and monitoring standards, or best\nmanagement practices for design, operation and maintenance of control\nfacilities, provided that the commission reserves the power to monitor\ndischarges and enforce the 15 mg/l oil and grease standard in subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph as an effluent limit. (4)\n\nThe average oil and grease concentration\nfor any storm discharge event shall be determined from samples collected in\nsuch manner and such location as to be representative of the actual\ndischarge. (b) Industrial wastewater discharges. Industrial wastewater discharges shall not\nexceed the limits as prescribed in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's\npromulgated effluent standards for the industrial category in\nquestion. (2)\n\nTotal dissolved solids shall not exceed 1,000 mg/l, or a concentration\nestablished by the commission which is compatible with designated water uses\nand stream quality objectives, and recognizes the need for reserve capacity to\nserve future dischargers. (e) Allocation of capacity. Where necessary\nto meet the stream quality objectives, the waste assimilative capacity of the\nreceiving waters shall be allocated in accordance with the doctrine of\nequitable apportionment. (f) Intermittent streams. (1)\n\nDischarges to\nintermittent streams may be permitted by the commission only if the applicant\ncan demonstrate that there is no reasonable economical alternative, the project\nis environmentally acceptable, and would not violate the stream quality\nobjectives set forth in section\n860.3\n(a)(1)(i)\nof\nthis Part. (2)\n\nDischarges to\nintermittent streams shall be adequately treated to protect stream uses, public\nhealth and ground water quality, and prevent nuisance conditions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n860.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
