  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 369.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nChapter 722 of the Laws of 1996 created a new performance of\nduty disability retirement which covers members in the uniformed personnel in\ninstitutions under the jurisdiction of Department of Correctional Services and\n\nSecurity Hospital Treatment Assistants, as those terms are defined in section\n89\nof the Retirement and Social Security Law. Chapter 722 added a new section 63-A, a new section 507-b and a new section\n607-a to, the Retirement and Social Security Law, which govern the benefit. While sections 63-A, 507-b and 607-a as added by chapter 722, cover the\nsubstantive requirements for eligibility for the new performance of duty\ndisability retirement benefit and contains provisions relating the benefit\ncalculation, they do not contain any provisions pertaining to the filing of\napplications for the performance of duty disability benefit covered therein. Under these sections, the benefit is to be calculated under the liberal formula\nwhich covers Tier 1 accidental disability retirement benefits, and the benefit\nis to be offset under section\n64\nof the Retirement and Social Security Law\nby Workers' Compensation benefits in the same manner as is applicable to\naccidental disability retirement benefits. Accordingly, in view of the above\nand other available information regarding the legislative intent, we believe\nthat it is clear that the Legislature intended that the rules governing filing\nprocedures and deadlines to be applied to performance of duty disability\nretirement under these sections are the liberal accidental disability\nretirement filing provisions of section\n63\nof the Retirement and Social Security Law\nand any regulations applying thereto, including Part 309 of this\n\nTitle. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n369.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
