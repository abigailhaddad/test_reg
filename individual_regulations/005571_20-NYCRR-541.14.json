  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 541.14 - Floor covering\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThe installation of floor covering is\nsubject to sales tax, regardless of the method of installation or the surface\nover which the floor covering is installed, unless the installation qualifies\nfor exemption under subdivision (b) of this section. (2)\n(i) The\nterm floor covering includes carpet, carpet tile, carpet padding, linoleum and\nvinyl roll floor covering, linoleum tile, vinyl tile and other similar floor\ncoverings but not area rugs and the like. (ii)\n\nThe term floor covering does not include\nflooring such as wood flooring, ceramic tile, terrazzo, marble, concrete or\nother similar flooring. Accordingly, the provisions of this section do not\napply to the installation of flooring. See section\n527.7\nof this Title for the rules to determine whether such flooring qualifies as a\ncapital improvement. (b) (1)\n\nThe\ninstallation of floor covering is exempt from sales tax only if the following\ncriteria are met: (i) the installation must\nbe of the initial finished floor covering; and\n(ii)\nthe installation must be made in: (a) the new construction of a building or\nstructure; or\n(b) the new\nconstruction of an addition to an existing building or structure; or\n(c) the total reconstruction of an existing\nbuilding or structure. (2)\n\nFor purposes of this Subchapter: (i) New construction of a building or\nstructure means the original construction of a building or structure that did\nnot exist before such construction. (ii)\n\nNew construction of an addition to an\nexisting building or structure means the original construction of a new room, wing or other discrete, substantial unit of a building or structure which\nenlarges the exterior of the existing building or structure. (iii)\n\nTotal reconstruction of an existing\nbuilding or structure means the complete rehabilitation or replacement of most\nof the major structural elements of an existing building or structure, such as\nthe roof, ceiling trusses, floor joists, walls, support columns, support beams, girders and the foundation. (3)\n\nFloor covering installed as the initial\nfinished floor covering shall be deemed to be installed in new construction, a\nnew addition or total reconstruction where it is installed within six months of\nthe date of completion of the new construction, new addition or total\nreconstruction. (c) Examples. Example 1:A homeowner engages a contractor to remodel the\nkitchen. The contract calls for replacing built-in appliances, countertops, cabinets and floor covering. The contractor bills the homeowner for the\nremodeling of the kitchen and correctly charges tax only on the sale and\ninstallation of the floor covering. The installation of the built-in\nappliances, countertops and cabinets constitutes capital improvements as\ndescribed in section\n527.7\nof this Title. Thus, charges for such installation are exempt from tax to the\nhomeowner. Since the floor covering is not the initial installation, as\ndescribed in subdivision (b) of this section, it is subject to tax. Example 2:A new home is constructed and its owner contracts\nto have hardwood floors installed in the bedrooms, living and dining rooms. In\naddition, the owner will have wall-to-wall carpet installed in these rooms\nbefore the house is occupied. The carpet qualifies as a capital improvement as\nit is the initial finished floor covering and the installation occurred during\nthe original construction. Example 3:Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except\nthat the carpet will not be installed in one of the bedrooms until three months\nafter the owner moves in because the carpet manufacturer cannot make timely\ndelivery. The installation of the carpet still qualifies as a capital\nimprovement since installation occurred within six months of construction in\naccordance with subdivision (b) of this section. Example 4:Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except\nthat the home owner does not have carpet installed until the house is a year\nold. The carpet installation does not qualify as a capital improvement since it\nwas not made within six months of the time the home was built, and charges for\nboth labor and material are taxable. Example 5:A floor covering contractor removes wall-to-wall\ncarpet and installs new wall-to-wall carpet padding and carpet as its\nreplacement. The total charge for the installation and sale of the padding and\ncarpet is subject to sales tax, as it is not installed as the initial finished\nfloor covering. Example 6:A tenant enters into a bare-wall lease to rent\nthe entire third floor of a new office building. The tenant has the right to\nfinish the third floor of the building to suit its needs. When the lease\nterminates, all improvements made by the tenant will become the property of the\nowner of the building. As part of finishing the premises, the tenant arranges\nwith a building contractor for the installation of a suspended ceiling, construction of offices, paneling the walls, installation of complete\nelectrical, plumbing, heating and air-conditioning systems and for the\ninstallation of wall-to-wall carpet. The new ceiling, offices, paneling and\nelectrical, plumbing, heating and air-conditioning systems qualify as capital\nimprovements in accordance with section\n527.7\nof this Title. The new wall-to-wall carpet qualifies as a capital improvement\nin accordance with subdivision (b) of this section because it is the\ninstallation of the initial finished floor covering in new construction. Example 7:Assume that the tenant in Example 6, in the tenth\nyear of the lease, hires a contractor to renovate the premises. The existing\nceiling, overhead lighting, wall paneling and carpet are to be replaced. The\nnew ceiling, lighting and paneling qualify as capital improvements in\naccordance with section\n527.7\nof this Title. However, the charge by the contractor for the new carpet and its\ninstallation is subject to sales tax because the renovation is not new\nconstruction, an addition or a total reconstruction. Example 8:A room in a house is damaged by a fire that\ndestroys the floor and causes smoke and water damage to the walls and ceiling. The homeowner hires a contractor to make the necessary repairs. The contractor\nreplaces the floor, including the floor joists and plywood sub-floor. Vinyl\ntile floor covering is installed over the plywood. The contractor also removes\nand replaces the plaster board in the ceiling and on the walls and paints them. The charge by the contractor for the replacement of the floor joists and\nplywood sub-floor and the new walls and ceiling are exempt from tax as capital\nimprovements in accordance with section\n527.7\nof this Title. However, the charge by the contractor for the new vinyl tile\nfloor covering is subject to tax because it is not installed in the total\nreconstruction of the customer's home. In order for the floor covering to\nqualify as a capital improvement, most of the major structural elements of the\nentire building must be replaced. Here, the only structural element replaced\nwas the floor of only one room of the building. Example 9:A building is destroyed by fire. Only the shell\nremains. Because of its historical significance, the shell is preserved and the\nbuilding is totally reconstructed. The foundation is shored up and the major\nstructural elements of the building, including girders, support beams and floor\njoists and ceiling trusses, are replaced. The initial finished floor covering\ninstalled throughout the building at the time of the reconstruction is a\ncapital improvement in accordance with subdivision (b) of this\nsection. Notes\nN.Y.
