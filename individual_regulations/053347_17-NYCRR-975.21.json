Tit. 17 § 975.21 - Audits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\n\nCommissioner pursuant to sections\n18-b\nand\n14-g\nof the\n\nTransportation Law, and any city or county contracting for the provision of\nmass transportation services pursuant to section\n119-r\nof the General Municipal Law has the power to audit and examine the accounts, books, records, documents and papers of any participating public transportation\nsystem or person, firm, or corporation. In the event the system, or person, firm, or corporation refuses to comply with the audit provisions, all future\noperating assistance payments will be withheld to that system or person, firm, or corporation, until the system, or person, or firm or corporation complies\nwith the audit provisions. Furthermore, the Commissioner shall be provided, upon request with copies of audits performed by or in satisfaction of\nrequirements for other levels of government that directly related to the\nprovision of governmental operating aid. (b) When either final financial reports, subject to adjustment by audit, or an audit of a prior year does result in an\noverpayment, the amount of the overpayment including interest per section\n975.16\nof this Part will be\nrecovered either from the municipal sponsor or directly from intercity carriers\nunder contract from the Department. Overpayment amounts can be recovered\nthrough the reduction of future STOA payments or repayment from the local\ngovernment. In the event there are no further STOA payments due, the State will\ntake whatever steps are appropriate to recover the funds. (c) If a county or city elects to contract\nwith a municipality, corporation, firm, or individual for the provision of mass\ntransportation services, pursuant to section\n18-b\nof the\n\nTransportation Law and section\n119-r\nof the General Municipal Law, auditing expenses necessitated solely by State\noperating assistance program participation may be considered as part of the\nrequired matching payment; however, eligible annual auditing expenses may not\nexceed one percent of the amount of state operating aid received in a year or\n$5,000 per subsidiary, corporation or individual operator, which ever is\ngreater.
