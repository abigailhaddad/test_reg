  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 351.6 - Probation supervision\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe goal of probation supervision is to reduce recidivism\nby achieving a balance between risk management and risk reduction. Probation\nsupervision is the foundation for that balance and required as follows: (a) If the case is an active case, differential supervision shall be based on the results of the assessment\ninstrument and the case plan, as follows: (1)\n\nFor the greatest risk population, the probation department shall conduct a\nminimum of six probationer contacts, six collateral contacts, and one positive\nhome contact per month. The probationer contacts shall include one in-person\ncontact per week and two probationer contacts per month. One positive home\ncontact is required each month from case assignment. A positive home contact\nconstitutes one of the required in-person contacts. After the stabilization\nperiod of three months for juveniles and three-six months for adults has been\ncompleted, and if the probationer has complied with the conditions of probation\nand the case plan, he/she may be considered for merit credit. Up to one\nprobationer contact per month may be credited. (2)\n\nFor the high risk population, the\nprobation department shall conduct a minimum of one in-person contact per week, six collateral contacts per quarter, and one home contact per month. One\npositive home contact is required during the first month from case assignment. Thereafter, three home contacts are required each quarter, one completed each\nmonth during the quarter, two of which must be positive home contacts. A\npositive home contact constitutes a required in-person contact. After the\nstabilization period of three months for juveniles and three-six months for\nadults has been completed, and if the probationer has complied with the\nconditions of probation and the case plan, he/she may be considered for merit\ncredit. Up to one in-person contact per month may be credited. (3)\n\nFor the medium risk population, the\nprobation department shall conduct a minimum of two probationer contacts per\nmonth and two collateral contacts per quarter. The probationer contacts shall\ninclude one in-person contact per month. One positive home contact is required\nduring the first 45 calendar days from case assignment and as needed\nthereafter. A positive home contact constitutes one of the required in-person\ncontacts. If the probationer has complied with the conditions of probation and\nthe case plan, he/she may be considered for merit credit. Up to one probationer\ncontact per month may be credited. (4)\n\nFor the low risk population, the\nprobation department shall conduct a minimum of one contact per month. Collateral contacts and home contacts will be conducted as needed. Merit credit\nactivities may be used as incentives only. (b) Contact substitution. Contact substitutions are available only for juvenile\ndelinquent and Persons in Need of Supervision probationers under age 18 at the\ntime of disposition. Contact substitutions, lasting no longer than six months\nin duration, are specifically for those juveniles on probation supervision who\nare participating in a community-based treatment or therapeutic program which\nis evidence-based. During program participation, in-person contacts and\npositive home contacts with outside agency program staff may be substituted for\nprobation department required contacts; up to 50 percent of the required\nprobationer contacts per month or quarter, as determined by their risk level, may be substituted. During the time of program participation and where\nsubstitutions are applied, a probation officer must conduct one of the\ncollateral contacts as required with the agency/program, and document the\nprobationer progress in the case record. Merit credits may not be applied\nduring the period of contact substitution.
