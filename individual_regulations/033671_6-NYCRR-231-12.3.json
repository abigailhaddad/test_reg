Tit. 6 §§ 231-12.3 - Pre-application analysis for subparts 231-7 and 231-8\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prior to submitting an application for a\npermit in accordance with Subpart 231-7 and Subpart 231-8 of this Part, the\napplicant must provide an analysis of air quality data in the area that the\nproposed new or modified facility would affect for each of the following\nregulated NSR contaminants: (1)\nfor the new\nfacility, each regulated NSR contaminant that would have the potential to emit\nin an amount equal to or greater than the applicable significant project\nthreshold in table 6 of Subpart 231-13 of this Part; and\n(2)\nfor the modified facility, each regulated\nNSR contaminant that would result in a significant net emissions\nincrease. (b) With\nrespect to any such regulated NSR contaminant from the list of applicable\nregulated NSR contaminants in section\n231-12.4\nof this Subpart for which\nno NAAQS exists, the analysis must contain such air quality monitoring data as\nthe department determines is necessary to assess ambient air quality for that\nregulated NSR contaminant in any attainment area that the emissions of the\nsource would affect. (c) With\nrespect to any such regulated NSR contaminant for which a NAAQS does exist, the\nanalysis must contain continuous air quality monitoring data gathered for\npurposes of determining whether emissions of that regulated NSR contaminant\nwould cause or contribute to a violation of the standard or any maximum\nallowable increase in section\n231-12.2\n(c)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart. (d) In general, the\ncontinuous air quality monitoring data that is required must have been gathered\nover a period of at least one year and must represent at least the year\npreceding receipt of the application, except that, if the department determines\nthat a complete and adequate analysis can be accomplished with monitoring data\ngathered over a period shorter than one year, but not less than four\nmonths. (e) The owner or operator of\na proposed new or modified facility involving the emissions of VOC who\nsatisfies all other conditions of Subparts 231-7 and 231-8 of this Part may, when authorized by the department, provide post approval monitoring data for\nozone in lieu of providing preconstruction monitoring data. (f) Operations of monitoring stations. The\nowner or operator of a new or modified facility must meet the requirements of\nappendix B to 40 CFR part\n58\nand the NYSDEC policy, Oversight of Private Air\n\nMonitoring Networks, available from the department, during the operation of\nmonitoring stations for purposes of satisfying applicable provisions of this\n\nSubpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n231-12.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
