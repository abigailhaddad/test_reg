  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 387.19 - Claims against households\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All adult household members will be\njointly and severally liable for the value of any over- issuance of benefits to\nthe household. Local departments must establish a claim(s) against any\nhousehold that has received more food stamp benefits than it is entitled to\nreceive or any household which contains an adult member who was an adult member\nof another household that received more food stamp benefits than it was\nentitled to receive. (1)\n\nCollection of claims\nagainst any or all adult members of a household will be initiated at the time\nthe over-issuance occurred. If a change in household composition occurs, collection action must be pursued against any household which has a member who\nwas an adult member of a household that received the over-issuance. The amount\nof the claim may also be offset against restored benefits owed to any household\nwhich contains a member who was an adult member of the household at the time\nthe over-issuance occurred. Under no circumstances can the collection exceed\nthe amount of the claim. (2)\n\nCollections of overissuances. A social services district must collect any\noverissuance of food stamp benefits issued to a household by: (i) direct payment; (ii)\nreducing the allotment of the household\nas provided in paragraph (5) of this subdivision; (iii)\nwithholding amounts from unemployment\ncompensation from a member of the household, provided State computer supports\nare in place; (iv)\nrecovering from\n\nFederal pay or a Federal income tax refund, provided State computer supports\nare in place; or\n(v) any other\nmeans as directed by the State. Social services districts may use additional means to\ncollect overissuances provided such means are cost effective and do not violate\nany other provisions of this Part. (3)\n\nSuspending collection of inadvertent\nhousehold or administrative error claims. (i) Social services districts may suspend collection action on an inadvertent\nhousehold or administrative error claim if no collection action was initiated\nbecause of one of the following conditions: (a) the total amount of the claim is less\nthan $35, and the claim cannot be recovered through benefit level\nreduction; (b) the social services\ndistrict has documentation which shows that the household cannot be located; or\n(c) the case is being referred\nfor possible prosecution or for administrative disqualification and the social\nservices district determines that collection action would prejudice the\ncase. (ii)\n\nThe\ncollection of an inadvertent household error claim against a non-participating\nhousehold or the collection of any administrative error claim may be suspended\nif collection action has already been initiated and at least one demand letter\nhas been sent and: (a) the household cannot\nbe located; or\n(b) the cost of\nfurther collection action is likely to exceed the amount that can be\nrecovered. (4)\n\nSuspending collection of intentional\nprogram violation claims. (i) A social\nservices district may suspend collection action on an intentional program\nviolation claim at any time if it has documentation that the household cannot\nbe located. (ii)\n\nThe collection of\nany intentional program violation claim against a non-participating household\nmay be suspended if the cost of further collection action is likely to exceed\nthe amount that can be recovered and demand letters have been sent as follows: (a) claims under $100 - at least one demand\nletter; (b) claims between $100 and\n$400 - at least two demand letters; or\n(c) claims of more than $400 - at least three\ndemand letters. (5)\n\nRecoupment of claims through reduction of\ncurrent benefits must be applied as follows: (i) for an inadvertent household error or an\nadministrative error as defined in section\n387.1\nof this Part - 10 percent of\nthe household's monthly allotment or $10 per month, whichever is greater; and\n(ii)\nfor an intentional program\nviolation as defined in section\n387.1\nof this Part - 20 percent of\nthe amount the household would have received if the household member(s) had not\nbeen disqualified or $10 per month, whichever is greater. (6)\n\nTerminating collection of claims. Social\nservices districts may determine a claim to be uncollectable after it has been\nsuspended for a period of three years. A suspended or terminated claim must be\noffset against restored benefits as provided in section\n387.18\n(f) of this\n\nPart. (b) Calculating\nthe amount of claims. (1)\n\nInadvertent\nhousehold error and administrative error claims. (i) For each month that a household received\nan overissuance due to an inadvertent household error or administrative error, the social services district which issued the food stamps must determine the\ncorrect amount of food stamp benefits the household was entitled to receive. The amount of the inadvertent household or administrative error claim must be\ncalculated based on the amount of the overissuance which occurred during the 12\nmonths preceding the date the overissuance was discovered. In cases involving\nreported changes, the social services district must determine the month the\noverissuance initially occurred as follows: (a) If, due to an inadvertent error on the\npart of the household, the household failed to report a change in its\ncircumstances within the required timeframes, the first month affected by the\nhousehold's failure to report is the first month in which the change would have\nbeen effective had it been timely reported. However, in no event may the social\nservices district determine as the first month in which the change would have\nbeen effective any month later than two months from the month in which the\nchange in household circumstances occurred. (b) If the household timely reported a change\nbut the social services district did not act on the change within the required\ntimeframes, the first month affected by the district's failure to act is the\nfirst month the district would have made the change effective had it acted\ntimely. However, in no event may the social services district determine as the\nfirst month in which the change would have been effective any month later than\ntwo months from the month in which the change in household circumstances\noccurred. If a notice of adverse action was required but not provided, the\nsocial services district must assume for the purpose of calculating the claim\nthat the maximum advance notice period would have expired without the household\nrequesting a fair hearing under Part 358 of the Title. (ii)\n\nIf the household received a larger\nallotment than it was entitled to receive, the social services district must\nestablish a claim against the household equal to the difference between the\nallotment the household received and the allotment the household should have\nreceived. (iii)\n\nAfter calculating\nthe amount of the inadvertent household or administrative error claim, the\nsocial services district must offset the amount of the claim against any\namounts which have not yet been restored to the household. The social services\ndistrict must then initiate collection action for the remaining balance, if\nany. (2)\n\nIntentional\nprogram violation claims. (i) For each month\nthat a household received an overissuance due to an act of intentional program\nviolation, the social services district must determine the correct amount of\nfood stamp benefits, if any, the household was entitled to receive. The amount\nof the intentional program violation claim must be calculated retroactive to\nthe month the act of intentional program violation occurred, regardless of the\nlength of time that elapsed until the determination of intentional program\nviolation was made. However, the social services district must not include in\nits calculation any amount of the overissuance which occurred in a month more\nthan six years from the date the overissuance was discovered. If the household\nmember is determined to have committed an intentional program violation by\nintentionally failing to report a change in its household's circumstances, the\nfirst month affected by the household's failure to report is the first month in\nwhich the change would have been effective had it been reported. (ii)\n\nIf the household received a larger\nallotment than it was entitled to receive, the social services district must\nestablish a claim against the household equal to the difference between the\nallotment the household received and the allotment the household should have\nreceived. (iii)\n\nWhen determining\nthe amount of benefits the household should have received, the social services\ndistrict must not apply the 20 percent earned income deduction to that portion\nof the earned income which the household intentionally failed to\nreport. (iv)\n\nOnce the amount of the\nintentional program violation claim is established, the social services\ndistrict must offset the claim against any amount of lost benefits that have\nnot yet been restored to the household.
