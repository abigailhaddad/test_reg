Tit. 22 § 1200.1.14 - Client with diminished capacity\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When a client's capacity to make\nadequately considered decisions in connection with a representation is\ndiminished, whether because of minority, mental impairment or for some other\nreason, the lawyer shall, as far as reasonably possible, maintain a\nconventional relationship with the client. (b) When the lawyer reasonably believes\nthat the client has diminished capacity, is at risk of substantial physical, financial or other harm unless action is taken and cannot adequately act in the\nclient's own interest, the lawyer may take reasonably necessary protective\naction, including consulting with individuals or entities that have the ability\nto take action to protect the client and, in appropriate cases, seeking the\nappointment of a guardian ad litem, conservator or guardian. (c) Information relating to\nthe representation of a client with diminished capacity is protected by Rule\n1.6. When taking protective action pursuant to paragraph (b), the lawyer is\nimpliedly authorized under Rule 1.6(a) to reveal information about the client, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to protect the client's\ninterests.
