  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 350-2.4 - Separation of food scraps for recycling\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as provided in subdivision (c) of\nthis section, on or after January 1, 2022, any designated food scraps generator\nthat is within 25 miles (measured in a straight line) of an organics\nrecycler(s) or an intermediary facility used prior to recycling such as a\nregional depackaging facility or a transfer facility, to the extent that the\nfacility has capacity to accept all of the generator's food scraps based on the\ndepartment's yearly estimate of an organic recycler's or intermediary\nfacility's capacity in accordance with this part, must do the following: (1)\n\nSeparate its food scraps from other\nnon-organic solid waste. The materials separated will depend on the\ncapabilities of the organics recycler or intermediary facility used by the\ndesignated food scraps generator. For example, post-consumer food scraps do not\nhave to be collected by the designated food scraps generator unless the\norganics recycling facility is capable of removing contaminants (plastics, etc.) that are likely to be present with the food scraps. The designated food\nscraps generator can determine the most efficient and appropriate separation\nmethods for their operation. (2)\n\nEnsure proper storage of food scraps on-site to prevent scraps from becoming\nodorous or attracting vectors. Proper storage includes, for example, a\ncontainer that has a lid and a latch that keeps the lid closed and is resistant\nto tampering by rodents or other wildlife and has sufficient\ncapacity. (3)\n\nFollow applicable New\n\nYork State Department of Health and New York State Department of Agriculture\nand Markets regulations and standards. (4)\n\nHave information available and provide\ntraining for employees concerning the proper methods to separate and store food\nscraps. (5)\n\nObtain the services of\na transporter that will deliver food scraps to an organics recycler or\nintermediary facility, self-haul its food scraps to an organics recycler or\nintermediary facility, or provide for organics recycling at the designated food\nscraps generator's location. If a transporter is not available, the designated\nfood scraps generator is not required to self-haul or recycle at their\nlocation. (b) Use of\non-site treatment systems. If a designated food scraps generator is required to\nrecycle under subdivision (a) of this section and chooses to use an on-site\ntreatment system, the following criteria apply. (1)\n\nIf the on-site treatment system does not\ntreat at least 80 percent, by volume, of the food scraps generated annually, the remainder must be sent to an off-site organics recycler or intermediary\nfacility with sufficient capacity if one exists within 25 miles of the\ngenerator (measured in a straight line). (2)\n\nFor on-site treatment systems that\ndischarge to the public sewer system, the designated food scraps generator must\nobtain approval in writing from the appropriate local government entity to use\nthe public sewer system for this purpose, including applying for and obtaining\nany necessary permits or other authorizations. (3)\n\nThe materials generated from an on-site\ntreatment system that are not discharged to the sewer system must be used in a\nbeneficial manner or sent to an organics recycler or intermediary\nfacility. (4)\n\nIf the on-site\ntreatment system does not significantly reduce the volatile solids content of\nthe food scraps and grinds the waste or otherwise transfers it to a sewer\nsystem or treatment plant with little or no biological treatment, the fraction\nof the resultant biosolids equal to the fraction of food scraps in the incoming\nwaste stream (dry weight basis) must be used in a beneficial manner. The\ntreatment plant is not required to recycle biosolids. (c) Separation of food scraps by the\ndesignated food scraps generator is not required for a generator that sends all\nof its food scraps to be processed in a solid waste composting, solid waste\nanaerobic digestion facility, or other organics recycler or intermediary\nfacility capable of managing the waste without source separation.
