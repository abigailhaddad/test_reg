  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 212.10 - Fouls; Acts constituting fouls\n\nState Regulations\n(a) During a match, only the referee can assess a foul, and the referee shall\ndetermine whether an assessed foul is accidental or intentional. If the referee\ndoes not call the foul, judges must not make that assessment on their own and\nshould not factor such into their scoring calculations. If a foul is committed, the referee shall call timeout, order the offending combatant to a neutral\nlocation, check the fouled combatant's condition and safety, and shall then\nassess the foul to the offending contestant and deduct points or impose\ndisqualification if the referee deems it appropriate, and notify the\ncommission, the corners, the official scorekeeper of his decision on whether\nthe foul was accidental or intentional and whether any point deduction or\ndisqualification is imposed. Disqualification from a mixed martial arts contest\nor exhibition may occur after any combination of fouls or after a flagrant\nfoul, as determined by the referee. Fouls may result in points being deducted\nby the official scorekeeper from the offending combatant's score, as determined\nby the referee. Where points are deducted, the scorekeeper, not the judges, will be responsible for calculating the true score after factoring in the point\ndeduction. (b) The following acts\nconstitute fouls in a professional mixed martial arts contest or exhibition: (1)\n\nButting with the head. (2)\n\nEye gouging of any kind. (3)\n\nBiting. (4)\n\nHair pulling.

(c) If a fighter is fouled by a\nblow that the referee deems illegal, the referee should stop the action and\ncall for time, except as otherwise provided in subdivision d of this section. The referee may take the fighter to the ringside doctor and have the ringside\ndoctor examine the fighter as to their ability to continue on in the contest. The ringside doctor has up to 5 minutes to make their determination. If the\nringside doctor determines that the fighter can continue in the contest, the\nreferee shall as soon as practical restart the fight. Unlike the low blow foul\nrule provided in subdivision e of this section, the fighter does not have up to\n5 minutes of time to use, at their discretion, and must continue the fight when\ninstructed to by the referee. If the referee stops a contest and employs the\nuse of the ringside doctor during the contest, the ringside physician's\nexaminations shall not exceed 5 minutes. If 5 minutes is exceeded, the fight\ncannot be re-started and the contest must end.
