  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 709.2 - Acute care facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nmethodology will be utilized in the evaluation of certificate of need\napplications involving the construction or establishment of new or replacement\nbeds in an acute care hospital and the need for acute care facilities and\nservices. It is the intent of the State Hospital Review and Planning Council\nthat this methodology, when used in conjunction with the planning standards and\ncriteria set forth in Part 708 of this Title and section\n709.1\nof this Part, become a\nstatement of basic principles and planning/decisionmaking tools for guiding and\ndirecting the development of hospital services throughout the State. Additionally, it is intended that the methodology will provide potential\napplicants with a framework to develop specific hospital feasability studies\nsubmitted as a part of certificate of need applications while allowing health\nsystems agencies sufficient flexibility to consider the unique and special\ncharacteristics of their respective areas in determining bed need. The\nmethodology is conceptually based on the application of uniform planning\nobjectives at the county and/or State level. Its purpose is to provide\nguidance, to insure flexibility, and to assist the health systems agencies, the\n\nCommissioner of Health and potential applicants in determining the future need\nfor acute care beds as consistent with the certificate of need program. The\ngoals and objectives of the methodology expressed in this section are expected\nto insure that an adequate institutional bed supply is available for normal and\nemergency needs. The methodology helps identify counties where the projection\nof future acute care bed need implies a potential for excess capacity and where\nsignificant issues of hospital access and viability may occur. The goals and\nobjectives of this methodology also are expected to result in minimizing the\nneed for costly inpatient care by encouraging the development and expansion of\nmore desirable lower cost alternatives, as well as insuring that high quality\ncare and an adequate institutional bed supply are available. (b) For purposes of this methodology, the\nbase year shall be 1991 and the planning target year shall be 1996. The\nplanning area shall be the county. (c) The methodology uses the following steps\nto estimate the need for medical/surgical and pediatric beds in the planning\ntarget year: (1)\n\nThe normative discharge\nutilization rates by county of patient residence for males and females ages\n0-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-44, 45-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85 and over are derived for\nmedical/surgical and pediatric services for the base year and the year five\nyears previous to the base year as set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (3)\nof this section. (2)\n\nThe\npopulation, males and females ages 0-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-44, 45-64, 65- 74, 75-84 and 85 and over, is estimated by county for the base year, the year five\nyears previous to the base year and for the planning target year as set forth\nin paragraph (d)(4) of this section. (3)\n\nNormative discharge utilization rates per\n1,000 population by county of patient residence and by peer groups of counties\nfor males and females ages 0- 9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-44, 45-64, 65-74, 75-84 and\n85 and over are estimated for the planning target year as set forth in\nparagraphs (d)(5) through (8) of this section. (4)\n\nThe number of expected discharges is\nderived by multiplying the utilization rates by county for males and females\nages 0-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-44, 45-64, 65- 74, 75-84 and 85 and over for the\nplanning target year by the estimated county population for the planning target\nyear divided by 1,000. (5)\n\nTotal\nexpected discharges by county of residence is the sum of the expected\ndischarges as set forth in paragraph (4) of this subdivision. (6)\n\nTo derive the estimated number of\ndischarges in the planning target year by county of hospitalization, the\nestimated number of expected discharges for the planning target year by county\nof residence is adjusted to reflect the migration of patients between counties\nin the State and for patients migrating from other states to New York as set\nforth in paragraphs (d)(9) and (10) of this section. (7)\n\nDischarges in the planning target year, by county of expected hospitalization, are distributed by diagnostic related\ngroups (DRG) and payor categories as set forth in paragraph (d)(11) of this\nsection. (8)\n\nActual average base\nyear length of stay for discharges in the county of hospitalization for each\nDRG and payor group is compared to national experience in length of stay for\neach DRG and payor group as set forth in paragraph (d)(12) of this section. The\nlowest length of stay, either the national experience or the county actual\naverage base year length of stay for each DRG and payor group, is multiplied by\nthe expected number of discharges for that DRG and payor group to derive\nexpected days of hospitalization in the planning target year. Expected days of\nhospitalization in the planning target year by DRG and payor groups are summed\nto derive total expected days. (9)\n\nDays of care provided to adults and pediatric patients are separated from total\nexpected days of hospitalization in the planning target year as set forth in\nparagraph (d)(13) of this section. Medical/surgical bed need is derived from\nadult days and pediatric bed need is derived from pediatric days. (10)\n\nExpected adult and pediatric days of\nhospitalization in the planning target year are divided by 365 to derive\naverage daily census for each county. (11)\n\nEstimated medical/surgical and pediatric\nbeds needed in the planning target year for each county are calculated by\ndividing average daily census by the expected occupancy rate as set forth in\nparagraph (d)(14) of this section. (12)\n\nThe estimates of public need for\nmedical/surgical and pediatric beds for the planning target year for each\ncounty are adjusted, as set forth in paragraphs (d)(15), (16) and (17) of this\nsection, to reflect the use of these beds for alternate level of care patients\nand other extraordinary disease occurrences which were not adequately reflected\nin the historic use rate experience. (d) The methodology for determining public\nneed for acute care beds and the estimates of projected bed need by county for\nthe planning target year shall be as follows: (1)\n\nThe initial data base for the base year\nand the year five years previous to the base year is extracted from the\n\nStatewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) for\nmedical/surgical and pediatric discharges. Excluded are neonatal discharges, newborns, and discharges with nonmedical/surgical DRGs of maternity, psychiatry, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, burns and medical rehabilitation. In the\nevent other methodologies are developed by the Department of Health to project\nacute care bed need for extraordinary disease occurrences, these discharges\nalso shall be removed from the base year and the year five years previous to\nthe base year. For the purposes of this methodology, discharges with human\nimmunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) are\nexcluded. (2)\n\nCounties with similar\ndemographic and socio-economic characteristics are grouped into peer groups for\npurposes of this methodology: Group\n1: Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens; 2: Dutchess, Nassau, Orange, Rockland, Suffolk, Richmond, Westchester; 3: Albany, Broome, Erie, Monroe, Niagara, Oneida, Onondaga; 4: Genesee, Madison, Montgomery, Ontario, Oswego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Wayne, 5: Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Chemung, Clinton, Cortland, Jefferson, Otsego, Steuben, Tompkins, Ulster, Warren; 6: Columbia, Greene, Hamilton, Herkimer, Livingston, Orleans, Putnam, Schoharie, Schuyler, Seneca, Washington, Wyoming, Yates; 7: Allegany, Cayuga, Chenango, Delaware, Essex, Franklin, Fulton, Lewis, St. Lawrence, Sullivan; 8: Tioga. (3)\n\nTo isolate health system changes that are\noccurring with the growth of hospital and free-standing ambulatory-surgery\nprograms, discharges in the initial data base for the base year and the year\nfive years previous to the base year are further classified based on their\nprincipal procedure code in SPARCS. Discharges whose principal procedure is\nincluded in the Department of Health's Ambulatory Surgery data base are\nclassified as appropriate for ambulatory surgery. Exceptions to this\nclassification include obstetric and newborn cases, deaths, transfers to acute\ncare and long term care facilities and procedures done less than five percent\nof the time on an ambulatory basis. (4)\n\nThe population age 0-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-44, 45-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85 and older shall be estimated by county by sex\nfor the base year, the year five years previous to the base year and the\nplanning target year using linear interpolation of the population projections\ndeveloped by the New York State Department of Economic Development and by\npopulation categories based on U.S. Census Bureau data. If the population\nprojections for the planning target year are based on census data collected 10\nyears or more before the planning target year, population projections for the\nplanning target year shall be adjusted to account for the percent difference in\nthe most recent year's actual census and the Department of Economic\n\nDevelopment's population projection for that same year. (5)\nA normative discharge utilization rate\nper 1,000 population by county of patient residence, for each sex, age group, and ambulatory-surgery category is calculated by dividing the number of\ndischarges by the population for each sex and age group and multiplying this\nratio by 1,000. (6)\n\nFor each peer\ngrouping of counties, the number of discharges in each sex, age group, and\nambulatory-surgery category are summed for a group total in the base year and\nthe year five years previous to the base year. The population projection for\nthe base year and the year five years previous to the base year for each sex\nand age group are summed for all counties in a peer group for a peer group\npopulation total. (7)\nA normative\ndischarge utilization rate per 1,000 population by county peer group for each\nsex, age group, and ambulatory-surgery category is derived by dividing the sum\nof county discharges by the sum of county population estimates as set forth in\nparagraph (6) of this subdivision and multiplying by 1,000. An average annual\nrate of change is calculated for each sex, age group, and ambulatory-surgery\ncategory between the year five years previous to the base year and the base\nyear. (8)\n\nThe projected utilization\nrate for the planning target year is calculated by applying the county peer\ngroup's average annual rate of change for each age group, sex and\nambulatory-surgery category to each county's base year utilization rate and\nthen each year thereafter up to the planning target year. This procedure shall\nbe performed in all county peer groups, except groups 1 and 8, to derive a\ncounty estimated utilization rate for the planning target year. For group 8, the base year actual utilization rates shall be used for the planning target\nyear. For group 1, the lowest actual average annual rate of change between the\nyear five years previous to the base year and the base year for each age, sex\nend ambulatory-surgery category shall be applied to each county's base year\nrate and each year thereafter up to the planning target year. (9)\n\nTo account for the migration of patients\nfrom the county of residence to the county of hospitalization, the projected\nnumber of discharges by county of residence in the planning target year will be\nsubdivided among the counties of hospitalization according to the same\nproportions as experienced by discharges in the base year. For example, if 50\npercent of the base year discharges residing in county A were hospitalized in\ncounty B, then 50 percent of the projected planning target year discharges\nresiding in county A shall be assumed hospitalized in county B. Discharges in\nthe counties of hospitalization are summed to derive a total number of\ndischarges by county of hospitalization. (10)\n\nTo account for the estimated number of\nnon-New York State residents hospitalized in New York State counties in the\nplanning target year, the actual number of non-New York State residents in the\nbase year is added to the projected number of discharges in the planning target\nyear as calculated in paragraph (9) of this subdivision. In the event that\nreliable information becomes available from the health systems agencies or\nother sources on migration pattern changes expected either within New York\n\nState counties or from non-New York State residents, then the migration\npatterns from the base year may be adjusted accordingly before being applied to\nthe planning target year. (11)\n\nFor\nthe purposes of this methodology, the 1991 Federal grouping system of DRGs, as\nset forth in Appendix D-1, infra, shall be used. The following four payor\ncategories are used: (i) Medicare; (ii)\n\nMedicaid; (iii)\n\nBlue Cross plus other commercial\ncarriers; and\n(iv)\nall other payors\nincluding self-pay. The percent distribution of discharges by DRG and payor\ngroup in the base year is applied to the number of discharges projected for the\nplanning target year to derive the projected number of discharges by DRG and\npayor group by county of hospitalization. (12)\n\nFor the purposes of this methodology, the 75th percentile of national length of stay data, as set forth in Appendix\nD-2, infra, shall be used. This national data is collected from inpatient\ndischarge records submitted by hospitals participating in the Professional\n\nActivity Study. If a DRG is excluded from the national survey because it is no\nlonger valid, ungroupable or inappropriate for length of stay determinations, then the actual New York State average length of stay by payor group in the\nbase year shall be used for the expected length of stay in the target\nyear. (13)\n\nPediatric days are\ndefined as days for patients ages 0-14. The actual proportion of pediatric days\nas a percent of total medical/surgical and pediatric days combined for the base\nyear is calculated for each county of hospitalization based on the age of the\npatients discharged. This actual base year percent distribution is multiplied\nby the projected number of total medical/surgical and pediatric days combined\nfor the planning target year to derive projected pediatric days. (14)\n\nThe following occupancy levels are\napplied to project acute care bed need by county and bed type: Bed Type         Urban  Rural\n\nMedical/surgical.85.80\n\nPediatric.70.65\n\nObstetric.75.70\n\nFor purposes of this methodology, the following counties\nare considered urban - Albany, Broome, Dutchess, Erie, Monroe, Nassau, Niagara, Oneida, Onondaga, Orange, Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester, Bronx, Kings, New\n\nYork, Queens and Richmond. The rural occupancy proportions shall be applied in\nall other counties in New York State. (15)\n\nPatients who no longer require acute\ncare but stay in the hospital Pending discharge are termed alternate level of\ncare (ALC) patients. Their bed use shall be added to the acute care bed need\nprojected for the planning target year. The number of ALC days in the base year\nand the year five years previous to the base year is extracted from the SPARCS\ncase-mix file by county of hospitalization for the following age groups - 0-44, 45-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85 and older. The statewide average annual rate of\nchange in the number of ALC days by age group is calculated between the year\nfive years previous to the base year and the base year. This average annual\nrate of change is applied to the statewide actual number of ALC days by age\ngroup in the base year and each year thereafter to the planning target year. The total number of ALC days statewide for the planning target year by age\ngroup are then distributed to each county of hospitalization according to the\npercent distribution of ALC days by county in the base year. (16)\n\nProjected ALC days by county of\nhospitalization are summed across the age groups to derive a total number of\nexpected ALC days by county. ALC days by county are divided by 365 to calculate\nan average daily census which is then added to the projected number of acute\ncare beds needed in each county. (17)\n\nThe estimates of need for acute care\nbeds as derived in the foregoing provisions of this section do not include\nestimates of need for acute care beds for patients with HIV/AIDS. Need for\nacute care beds to serve such patients shall be in addition to the estimates of\nneed otherwise derived in this subdivision. If there are other patients with\nextraordinary disease occurrences whose acute care use is not adequately\nrepresented in the base year rate or in the rate for the year five years\nprevious to the base year, an estimate of expected additional acute care bed\nneed for the planning target year also shall be added to account for the needs\nof these patients. (e) The methodology to derive an estimate for the need for obstetrical or maternity\nservice beds in the planning target year shall be as follows: (1)\n\nThe number of expected live births for\nthe planning target year is calculated by applying the projected age-specific\nbirth rate for the planning target year as estimated by the New York State\n\nDepartment of Economic Development to the projected female population of\nchild-bearing age (15-44 years) for the planning target year. If the\nprojections of births for the planning target year are based on census data\ncollected 10 years or more before the planning target year, projections of\nbirths for the planning target year shall be adjusted to account for the\npercent difference in the most recent year's actual births and the Department\nof Economic Development's projection of births for that same year. (2)\n\nAn estimated rate of spontaneous fetal\ndeaths and induced abortions is applied to the projected female population of\nchild-bearing age (15-44 years) for the planning target year and then added to\nthe expected number of live births to derive total expected obstetric\ndischarges. (3)\n\nTo derive the\nestimated number of discharges in the planning target year by county of\nhospitalization, the estimated number of expected discharges for the planning\ntarget year by county of residence shall be adjusted to reflect the migration\nof patients between counties in the State and for patients migrating from other\nstates to New York for the female population ages 15-44, as set forth in\nparagraphs (d)(9) and (10) of this section. (4)\n\nThe number of estimated obstetric\ndischarges for the planning target year is adjusted to account for the number\nof antenatal admissions, defined as admissions to obstetric beds which, while\nmaternity related, do not result in a delivery. Examples of antenatal services\nare ectopic pregnancies, threatened abortions, miscarriages, false labor and\nmaternity-related diagnostic procedures. The same proportion of antenatal\ndischarges by county of hospitalization, in the base year is added to the\nestimated number of obstetric discharges in the planning target year. (5)\n\nExpected discharges for the planning\ntarget year by obstetric-related diagnostic related group and payor are\ndistributed as set forth in paragraph (d)(11) of this section. (6)\n\nThe expected number of obstetric days for\nthe planning target year is calculated by multiplying the number of projected\ndischarges for each obstetric-related DRG and payor group by either the actual\naverage county length of stay or the 75th percentile of national length of stay\nby DRG and payor group, as set forth in Appendix D-2, infra, whichever is\nlower. Total obstetric days for the planning target year shall be further\nadjusted to reflect an expected length of stay for cesarean deliveries\nestimated by the Department of Health based on an analysis of the expected\nfrequency and length of stay of cesarean section deliveries in New York State\nhospitals. (7)\n\nThe expected number\nof obstetric days of hospitalization in the planning target year is divided by\n365 to derive an average daily census for each county. (8)\n\nThe estimated number of obstetric beds\nneeded in each county in the planning target year is calculated by dividing the\naverage daily census by the expected occupancy rate as set forth in paragraph\n(d)(14) of this section. (f) Periodically, but at least every five\nyears from the base year, the Department of Health, in conjunction with the\nhealth systems agencies' and the State Hospital Review and Planning Council, shall review and update the methodology and projections established pursuant to\nthis section to project acute care bed need to a new planning target year not\nto exceed five years from a new base year. (g) The county acute care bed need totals for\nmedical/surgical, pediatric and obstetric beds determined in accordance with\nsubdivisions (c), (d) and (e) of this section shall constitute the estimated\npublic need for medical/surgical, pediatric and obstetric beds in each county\nfor the planning target year. Each health systems agency may review the\nestimated bed need of its region and, in conjunction with the Department of\n\nHealth and the State Hospital Review and Planning Council, may: (1)\nmake recommendations for amending the\nneed estimates developed in accordance with subdivisions (c), (d) and (e) of\nthis section to reflect local characteristics. Factors that may be considered\nin this analysis include, but are not limited to, the following: an analysis of\ncurrent utilization patterns as it relates to projected trends developed\npursuant to the methodology for determining public need for acute care beds in\nsubdivisions (c), (d), and (e) of this section, health status indices of the\npopulation, high and low variation discharge composition, ambulatory care\nsensitive discharge experience and trends in alternate level of care; (2)\nidentify counties at high risk of\nundergoing acute care system changes due to an estimated excess of\nmedical/surgical, pediatric and/or obstetric bed capacity for the planning\ntarget year. Acute care system changes shall refer to any or all of the\nfollowing occurrences: discontinuation of acute care services, conversion of\nall or a portion of the acute care beds, decertification of all or a portion of\nthe acute care beds or hospital closure. A county at high risk of acute care\nsystem changes is one that meets at least one of the following criteria: (i) the estimated acute care bed need in the\ncounty for the planning target year is less than 85 percent of existing\ncapacity and there is at least one hospital in the county with fewer beds than\nthe estimated excess in medical/surgical, pediatric, and/or obstetric beds for\nthe county; or\n(ii)\nthe county is\nidentified as being at high risk by the local health systems agency, subject to\nthe approval of the commissioner, when other factors are determined to result\nin acute care systems changes. (h) The Department of Health in conjunction\nwith the health systems agencies may develop institution-specific\nrecommendations, with the concurrence of the State Hospital Review and Planning\n\nCouncil, for expected service needs and capital expenditure requirements. Commencing in 1994, and no more frequently than once a year, acute care\nfacilities, in counties identified as being at high risk pursuant to\nsubdivision (g) of this section, may be required to submit to the commissioner, on forms prescribed by the commissioner, a summary assessment of the facility's\nservice needs and capital expenditure requirements for at least the following\nfive calendar years. Based on these five-year plans and the estimated need for\nacute care beds in the county, the department, in consultation with the local\nhealth systems agencies, shall identify the need for appropriate changes in\nfacility utilization and services provided to achieve the projected acute care\nbed need. (i) Results of the acute\ncare bed need methodology, as set forth in subdivisions (c), (d) and (e) of\nthis section, together with any adjustments approved by the commissioner in\nconsultation with the State Hospital Review and Planning Council and developed\nin accordance with subdivision (g) of this section, shall be used when an\napplication proposes one of the following: (1)\nan increase in the facility's medical/surgical, pediatric or obstetric bed\ncomposition; (2)\na change in the\noperator of a hospital that requires a need review; (3)\na capital investment which meets at least\none of the following criteria: (i) the\nproject is a Capital Architectural and Program Alternatives (CAPA) project with\ntotal basic costs of construction as defined in section\n710.1\nof this Title, exceeding\n$25,000,000; or\n(ii)\nthe total\nbasic costs of construction is an amount which is greater than 50 percent of\nthe net depreciated value of the facility's total fixed assets used for\nhospital purposes. (j) When submitting feasibility studies in\nsupport of applications which are subject to this section, applicants shall use\nthe same discharge utilization rate calculations and trends as used in the\nacute care bed need methodology set forth in subdivisions (c), (d) and (e) of\nthis section. Feasibility studies may not incorporate changes in hospital\ndischarges based on market share changes except in the following instances: (1)\nacquisition of another hospital and\nconsolidation of inpatient activity; (2)\nintroduction of new services unavailable\nto the hospital service area population; or\n(3)\ncontinued increases in the market share\nbetween the year five years previous to the base year and the base\nyear. (k) The review of, and recommendations and decisions concerning, applications subject to this\nsection shall be based upon the following: (1)\nthe estimated county acute care bed need\nas set forth in subdivisions (c), (d), (e) and (g) of this section; and\n(2)\nthe county's expected\nservice needs and capital expenditure requirements, and the recommendations\ndeveloped and need for changes identified in accordance with subdivision (h) of\nthis section.
