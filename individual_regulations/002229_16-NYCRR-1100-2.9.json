A line of\nsight profile shall also be done for resources of statewide concern located\nwithin the VIA study area. The viewshed maps shall provide an indication of\nareas of potential visibility based on topography and vegetation, the highest\nelevation of facility structures and distance zone (foreground, midground and\nbackground areas). The potential screening effects of vegetation shall also be\nshown. Visually-sensitive sites, cultural and historical resources, representative viewpoints, photograph locations, and public vantage points\nwithin the viewshed study area shall be included on the map(s) or an overlay. An overlay indicating landscape similarity zones shall be included. (2)\n\nThe VIA shall include a description of\nthe methodology used to develop the viewshed maps, including software, baseline\ninformation, and sources of data. (3)\n\nThe viewshed mapping shall be used to\ndetermine the potential visibility from viewpoints to be analyzed (as indicated\nin the following paragraph (4) of this subdivision) and locations of viewer\ngroups in the vicinity of the facility, as determined pursuant to the\npre-application meeting(s) held pursuant to section 1100-1.3(a) of this Part. These shall include recreational areas, residential and business locations, historic properties (listed or eligible for listing on the State or National\n\nRegister of Historic Places), and travelers (interstate and other highway\nusers).
