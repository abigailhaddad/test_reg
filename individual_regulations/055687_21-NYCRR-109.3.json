  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 109.3 - Statement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Thruway\n\nAuthority is implementing the procedures herein in order to compensate the\ncontractors doing business with the authority in an expeditious, timely and\nfair manner in return for the proper verified delivery of their goods and\nservices to the authority. These standards are being promulgated in conformance\nwith Public Authorities Law, section 2880(1)-(16). (b) A contractor shall submit to the\nspecified designated payment office all written invoices, purchase orders, delivery tickets, price or quantity tabulations or other documents which are\nnecessary in order to verify the name, type and quantity of goods or services\nactually delivered or provided and for which payment is requested by or on\nbehalf of a contractor. (c) The\nauthority will make prompt payment under a contract: (1)\nwithin 45 calendar days after the receipt\nof a proper invoice at its designated payment office, for the amount of the\ncontract payment then due, such time allowance to apply to the payment of a\nproper invoice received by the authority on or after May 1, 1988; (2)\nwithin 30 calendar days, excluding legal\nholidays, after the receipt of a proper invoice at its designated payment\noffice, for the amount of the contract payment then due, such time allowance to\napply to the payment of a proper invoice received by the authority on or after\n\nJuly 1, 1989; (3)\nexcept when the\ncontract or contract payment is of a type where the facts and conditions are as\ndefined pursuant to paragraphs (f)(1)-(12) of this section. Any time taken to\nsatisfy or rectify any of the facts or conditions described therein (except for\nparagraphs [f][10]-[11] of this section) shall extend the date by which\ncontract payment must be made in order for the authority not to become liable\nfor interest payments by an equal period of time. (d) Pursuant to these rules and regulations, the authority shall pay interest on its contracts whenever prompt payment is\nnot made to its contractors as prescribed for in subdivision (c) of this\nsection and any other applicable provisions herein; interest under this Part\nshall be computed at the daily rate in effect on the date the interest is paid, as set by the State Tax Commission for corporate taxes pursuant to section\n1096 (e)(1)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (e) Interest hereunder will be\npayable from general toll revenues and other miscellaneous revenues. (f) Adjustments to the contract payment date\nand the receipt of an invoice date shall be made by the authority whenever, in\nits opinion, the facts and conditions reasonably justify such an extension. The\nauthority has determined that such facts and conditions exist in the following\ntypes of contracts and situations, and that an extension of the payment date is\nreasonably justified, when: (1)\nin the case of\nfinal payments on construction contracts: (i) the authority's chief engineer determines that the contractor has failed or\nneglected to properly submit the necessary documentation and other performance\nverification specifically prescribed by the contract requirements and\nspecifications; (ii)\nand/or the\nfinal agreement together with the final estimate has not been approved as\nrequired pursuant to such construction contract, before payment can be\nmade; (2)\nin the case of\nregular progress payments on construction contracts: (i) the authority's chief engineer determines\nthat the contractor has failed to properly submit the necessary documentation\nand other supporting data required by the contract, or mandated by any other\n\nState or Federal law, rule or regulation; (ii)\nthe specific contractual provisions, any\napplicable statute, or any State or Federal regulation, require or allow, a\nperiodic inspection or a periodic audit prior to such payments, provided that\nif no time is specified for completing such periodic inspection or audit, it is\ncompleted within a reasonable time; (3)\nin the case of engineering/architectural\nagreements for professional services, construction inspection or design, and: (i) in respect to final payments: (a) the specific contractual provisions, any\napplicable statute, or any State or Federal regulation, require, or allow, an\ninspection period or an audit, prior to such payment, provided that if no time\nis specified for completing such an audit or inspection, it is completed within\na reasonable time; (b) the\nauthority's chief engineer determines that the contractor has failed or\nneglected to properly submit the necessary documentation and other performance\nverification specifically prescribed by the contract requirements and\nspecifications; or\n(c) the\nauthority has not received an approved certification of audit or such other\nfinal verifying document as may be required pursuant to such contract before\npayment can be made; (ii)\nin respect to regular progress payments: (a) the specific contractual provisions, any\napplicable statute, or any State or Federal regulation, require, or allow, a\nperiodic inspection or a periodic audit prior to such payments, provided that\nif no time is specified for completing such periodic inspection or audit, it is\ncompleted within a reasonable time; (b) the authority's chief engineer determines\nthat the contractor has failed to properly submit the necessary documentation\nand other performance verification specifically prescribed by the contract\nrequirements and specifications; (4)\nthe Thruway Authority department of\nfinance and accounts, in the course of its preaudit function and investigation, determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that, as a substantive\nmatter, ascertained in the review of specific purchase or financial documents\nand other substantiating documentation, payment may not properly be due to the\nvendor or contractor, either in whole or in part; (5)\nin the case of contracts or obligations\nwhich require an investigation by authority field personnel of the facts, circumstances, or other background detail, for proper documentation of the\nsubmitted invoice, and the authority conducts or is conducting such an\ninvestigation in order to verify that payment is due, and such investigation\nresults in a verified voucher submitted to the director of operations for\napproval, said voucher will be considered a proper invoice upon such final\napproval by the director of that department, or any other applicable department\ninvolved; (6)\nthe necessary State\nor Federal government appropriation required to authorize payment has yet to be\nenacted or released; (7)\na proper\ninvoice must be examined and approved pursuant to contract or law by any other\ngovernmental entity prior to payment; (8)\n\nFederal funds are involved in any\nproject, and specified Federal requirements are yet to be completed before\npayment is authorized; (9)\nin the\nevent that any contract, as defined herein in section\n109.1\n(c) of this\n\nPart, entered into between the authority and a contractor on or after May 1, 1988 is not a valid, enforceable agreement until it has been approved either by\nthe Comptroller, or any other State or Federal agency, if so required by law or\nby such contract, provided that either the agreement shall contain a provision, or the contractor shall receive notice, stating that the agreement is subject\nto the approval of the Comptroller or some other required agency and that until\nsuch approval is given, the 45-day period (or the 30-day period after July 1, 1989) for the payment of invoices without interest shall not begin; (10)\nsuch date by which payment must be made\nis modified in accordance with paragraph (11) of this subdivision; (11)\n(i) in\nthe case of defects or improprieties, the authority shall have 15 calendar days\nafter receipt of an invoice at its designated payment office to notify the\ncontractor of either: (a) defects in the\ndelivered goods, property or services; (b) defects in the invoice; or\n(c) suspected improprieties of any\nkind; (ii)\nexcept as\nprovided in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, when the authority notifies a\ncontractor of such defects or suspected improprieties, and the contractor\nthereafter submits a corrected invoice or delivers corrected goods or services, the authority shall be considered as in receipt of an invoice on the date upon\nwhich the corrected invoice or corrected goods or services are received by the\nauthority, whichever is later. If a corrected invoice or corrected goods or\nservices are not required, the date of receipt of an invoice shall be the date\nupon which the authority determines that the suspected improprieties have been\nresolved; (iii)\nif the authority\nfails to notify a contractor of such suspected defects or suspected\nimproprieties within 15 calendar days of its first receipt of an invoice, the\nnew ROI date, as determined by subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, shall be\nadjusted to an earlier date, by a number of days equal to the number of days in\nexcess of 15 that the authority took after its first receipt of an\ninvoice; (12)\nin the\ncase of contracts, purchases, or other types of transactions where, either the\nspecific contractual provisions, any applicable statute, any State or Federal\nregulation or the circumstances surrounding the transaction itself, would\nmandate, require, or call for an inspection, investigation, audit or other\nperiod of delay before the authority could be considered to be in receipt of an\ninvoice. Examples of these types of transactions would include, but not be\nlimited to, situations where: (i) equipment\nor services require a detailed inspection and testing of the final product by\nappropriate authority personnel (example: electronics, component parts, mechanical equipment, etc.); (ii)\nthe agreement calls for special provisions to be met before payment is due, for\nexample, receipt of specific data sheets, instruction manuals, parts manuals, on-site training, even though the particular product may have already been\nreceived by the authority; (iii)\nthe agreement calls for a multifaceted system, completed system, or a working\nsystem, and only a portion of the system has been delivered or is operational, even though a vendor may have invoiced for the portion delivered or working; in\nsuch cases the authority will not be in receipt of an invoice until the total\nsystem or product is delivered and operational, or in whatever condition the\nparticular agreement or situation calls for; and\n(iv)\na discrepancy appears between a vendor's\ninvoice received at the designated payment office, and an authority receiving\nreport or other record of delivery, submitted from a field office. In any and\nall situations falling within this paragraph ([12][i]-[iv]), the authority will\nnot be considered in receipt of an invoice until or unless any such inspection, investigation, audit or other period of delay, has been completed and any and\nall conditions, deliveries, provisions, installations or other performances, have been completed and/or any and all discrepancies have been resolved. The\nnotice of defect provisions of this subdivision do not apply to any of the\nsituations within this paragraph ([12][i]-[iv]), until the authority: (a) conducts its inspections, investigations\nor other verification procedure; (b) full performance has been completed by\nthe vendor; and/or\n(c) any and all\ndiscrepancies have been resolved. The facts and conditions which the authority has determined\nto reasonably justify an extension of the contract payment date and/or the\nreceipt of the invoice date are in no event limited to those specifically set\nforth in paragraphs (1)-(12) of this subdivision. Thus the authority may amend\nthis statement at any time in the future to formally include any such additions\nas a part of its rules and regulations; (13)\nany time taken to satisfy, rectify or\ncomplete any of the types of conditions, situations or contingencies described\nin paragraphs (1)-(12) of this subdivision shall extend the required payment\ndate by an equal period of time.
