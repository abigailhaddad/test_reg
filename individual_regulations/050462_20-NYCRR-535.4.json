  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 535.4 - Jeopardy assessments\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1138(b), (d)\n(a) Timing. In the case of a jeopardy assessment, the Division of\n\nTaxation determines the amount of tax due from a taxpayer and gives notice of\nsuch determination prior to the filing of his return and prior to the date when\nthe taxpayer is required to file his return. (b) Reason for use. Jeopardy assessments are made if the Division of Taxation\nbelieves that the collection of any tax will be jeopardized by delay. The\n\nDivision of Taxation may abate any jeopardy assessment if it finds that\njeopardy does not exist. (c) Effect of jeopardy assessment. (1)\n\nThe amount of tax determined by a\njeopardy assessment is due and payable to the department by the person against\nwhom the jeopardy assessment is made as soon as the notice of the determination\nof such an assessment is given to such person. Notice of the determination\nunder jeopardy may be given by personal service or by registered or certified\nmail, in which case the provisions of section\n535.1\nof this Part apply. (2)\n\nThe\ndetermination by the Division of Taxation of the amount of tax owed in the case\nof a jeopardy assessment will finally and irrevocably fix the tax unless the\nperson assessed files a petition for a hearing or a request for a conciliation\nconference within 90 days of the date of mailing of the notice of such\ndetermination, or unless the Division of Taxation of its own motion\nredetermines the same. (d) Seizure of property. (1)\n\nIf the person against whom a jeopardy\nassessment is made does not immediately pay the tax due, the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance may seize such person's property in the manner provided\nfor in subdivision (b) of section\n1141\nof the Tax Law for purposes of\ncollecting the tax due. Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, property seized pursuant to a jeopardy assessment may not be sold\nby the Department of Taxation and Finance until the time to apply for a hearing\nor a conciliation conference as provided by section\n1138 (a)\nof the Tax Law and\nsection\n535.2\n(c) of this Part has expired. If an application for such a hearing or conciliation\nconference has been timely filed, then the sale of the seized property is\nfurther stayed until: (i) a conciliation\norder, issued by a conciliation conferee upholding the Division of Taxation's\nissuance of the jeopardy assessment, has become binding on the taxpayer; or\n(ii)\na determination, rendered\nby an administrative law judge upholding the Division of Taxation's issuance of\nthe jeopardy assessment, has become final; or\n(iii)\nwhere a timely exception to the\ndetermination of an administrative law judge has been filed with the Tax\n\nAppeals Tribunal, four months after the Tax Appeals Tribunal has issued a\ndecision that upholds the issuance of the jeopardy assessment by the Division\nof Taxation and has given notice of such decision to the person against whom\nthe jeopardy assessment is made. Cross-reference: For the rights of a person to a prompt hearing regarding\nthe propriety of warrants issued pursuant to jeopardy assessments, see Part\n2394 of this Title. (2)\n\nProperty seized pursuant to a jeopardy\nassessment may be sold at any time if: (i) the\nperson assessed fails to attend a hearing before the Division of Tax Appeals or\na conciliation conference before the Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation\n\nServices of which such person has been duly notified; (ii)\nthe person assessed consents to the\nsale; (iii)\nthe Division of\n\nTaxation determines that the expenses of conservation and maintenance will\ngreatly reduce the net proceeds; or\n(iv)\nthe property is perishable. (e) Filing a bond\nto avoid seizure of property. The seizure of property pursuant to a jeopardy assessment\nmay be avoided by filing with the department a bond issued by a surety company\nauthorized to transact business in this State and approved by the\n\nSuperintendent of Insurance of the State of New York as to solvency and\nresponsibility. The amount of such bond must equal the amount stated to be\nowing in the notice of determination sent to the taxpayer. The bond will be\nconditioned upon the payment of the amount of tax, together with interest and\npenalties thereon, which is finally determined to be due by the department or\nby a judicial proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules\nand not subject to further review, such payment to be made when the amount\nowing is finally determined and not subject to further review. (f) A jeopardy assessment may not be made in\nconnection with the liability of a purchaser, transferee, or assignee arising\nunder the provisions of subdivision (c) of section\n1141\nof the Tax Law.
