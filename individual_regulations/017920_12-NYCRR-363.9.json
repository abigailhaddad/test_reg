  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 363.9 - Computation of average weekly wage\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When all of the employee's employment\nduring the eight weeks immediately preceding and including his last day worked\nprior to commencement of disability has been performed in the employ of a\nsingle covered employer, the average weekly wage shall be the amount determined\neither by dividing the total wages paid such employee by such employer during\nthe last eight weeks immediately preceding and including his last day worked\nprior to commencement of such disability; or on the same basis, but excluding\nthe week in which the disability began (whichever is the higher amount) by the\nnumber of weeks during which he worked on at least one day during such eight-\nor seven-week period. (b) When the\nemployee is in the employment of more than one covered employer at the\ncommencement of disability, the average weekly wage with respect to employment\nwith each such employer shall be the amount determined either by dividing the\ntotal wages paid the employee by such employer during the last eight weeks\nimmediately preceding and including his last day worked prior to commencement\nof such disability; or on the same basis, but excluding the week in which the\ndisability began (whichever is the higher amount) by the number of weeks during\nwhich he worked on at least one day during such eight- or seven-week period\nwith such employer. (c) When all of\nthe employee's employment during the eight weeks immediately preceding and\neither including his last day worked prior to commencement of such disability, or excluding the week in which the disability began, has not been performed in\nthe employ of his last covered employer (or employers if concurrently eligible\nfor benefits to be provided by more than one covered employer), the average\nweekly wage shall be determined either by dividing the total wages received\nfrom his last covered employer (or employers if concurrently eligible for\nbenefits from more than one covered employer) during the last eight weeks\nimmediately preceding and including his last day worked prior to commencement\nof such disability, or on the same basis, but excluding the week in which the\ndisability began (whichever is the higher amount) by the number of weeks during\nwhich he worked on at least one day during such eight-or seven-week period, in\nsuch employment(s). (d) In the\nevent the computation of average weekly wage is made pursuant to subdivision\n(b) or (c) of this section and the employee notifies the employer or the\ncarrier that the average weekly wage upon which his benefits were computed does\nnot fairly represent his normal earnings and the employee presents a statement\nreasonably identifying his former covered employers and the amount of wages\nreceived from such employers to support this contention, the average weekly\nwage will again be computed by dividing the total wages received from all\ncovered employers during the eight weeks immediately preceding and including\nhis last day worked prior to commencement of such disability by the number of\nweeks during which he worked on at least one day in such employment. The higher\naverage weekly wage arrived at by this method or the method provided under\nsubdivision (b) or (c) of this section, whichever is applicable, shall be used\nas the employee's average weekly wage. (e) The average weekly wage to be used under\nany plan may be computed in accordance with the provisions of such plan filed\nwith and accepted by the chairman. (f) An employer may, in accordance with\nregular practice, compute average weekly wage on the basis of payroll weeks; provided, however, that any employee of such employer may request that the\nperiod used include the last day worked.
