  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 12-1.9 - Entering confined spaces\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nConfined spaces where dangerous\nair contaminants have been present, are present or could be introduced from\npotential sources shall not be entered by any person for any reason until the\natmosphere of such confined spaces has been tested and found free of dangerous\nair contaminants. Any such confined space shall be continuously maintained free\nof dangerous air contaminants during any period of occupancy. If, however, due\nto emergency conditions any such confined space cannot be cleared of dangerous\nair contaminants by mechanical ventilation or equivalent means, any person\nentering such confined space shall be provided with and shall use an approved\nair line respirator, approved hose mask or approved self-contained breathing\napparatus. (2)\n\nWhenever a confined\nspace is to be entered, a person who has been designated as a safety monitor\nshall function as required by this Part (rule). A confined space shall not be\nentered unless there is at least one other person in addition to the required\nsafety monitor ready to render assistance in an emergency when alerted. Such\nadditional person shall be located within 100 feet unobstructed walking\ndistance from and not more than one floor above or one floor below the access\nopening of such confined space. The assigned duties of such additional person\nshall be such that they will not prevent him from responding immediately to an\nemergency when alerted. (b) Preparation for entering a confined\nspace. Prior to entering any confined space, the following steps shall be taken\nto insure the safety of the person entering: (1)\n\nAny contents shall be removed, emptied or\ndrained from the confined space insofar as is possible and the interior shall\nbe purged by water or other equivalent means. (2)\n\nThe person entering the confined space or\na designated qualified person shall lock out the circuit breakers or switches\nof all electrically operated equipment such as agitator drives, pumps and\nsimilar equipment which is connected to or affects the confined space and could\naffect the health and safety of any person in the confined space. The keys for\nsuch locks shall be retained by the person entering the confined\nspace. (3)\n\nAll manhole and\nclean-out covers shall be removed and the openings maintained clear of any\nobstructions. (4)\n\nAll input lines\nwhich discharge into the confined space shall be disconnected and capped or\nprovided with line blank flanges. The use of a single in-line valve shut-off is\nprohibited as the sole means of isolating the confined space from any input\nline. However, the use of a double in-line valving arrangement with a vent in\nbetween the two valves is acceptable provided that dangerous air contaminants\nare not created by such venting. (5)\n\nTests in the confined space for the\npresence of dangerous air contaminants or lack of sufficient oxygen, or both, where the threat of each condition exists shall be made by a designated person\nwho is qualified to conduct such tests by training and experience. Such tests\nshall be performed using calibrated equipment of a type suitable for the air\ncontaminants involved. If such tests indicate that air contaminants in excess\nof the concentrations listed in subpart 12-3 of this Part (rule) are present in\nthe confined space, the space shall be purged by mechanical ventilation until a\nsubsequent test indicates that the air contaminant concentration is in\ncompliance with subpart 12-3 of this Part (rule). If more than one type of air\ncontaminant is known to be present or could be introduced in the confined\nspace, additional tests shall be made for each contaminant. A confined space\ncontaining air contaminants which may develop an explosion hazard shall be\npurged by mechanical ventilation until tests indicate that the concentration of\nair contaminants in the confined space is not more than 25 percent of the lower\nexplosive level of such air contaminants and that there is sufficient oxygen\navailable in the confined space. In lieu of purging by mechanical ventilation, an inert atmosphere may be maintained in the confined space, provided that\ncontrol devices are used to insure that combustion or ignition of material, including gases, cannot occur. Whenever an inert atmosphere is maintained in a\nconfined space, every occupant shall be equipped with an approved\nself-contained breathing apparatus, an approved air line respirator or an\napproved hose mask. Every occupant shall leave the confined space immediately\nin the event of an interruption of the air supply to the breathing apparatus. The inert atmosphere shall be prevented from contaminating all other work\nareas, including the area of the access opening to the confined space and\nadjacent areas. Maintenance of the inert atmosphere shall in no way interfere\nwith or prevent the emergency escape of an occupant from such a confined\nspace. (6)\n\nThe mechanical\nventilation system shall be so designed that the contaminants or contaminated\nair is transported to some safe location, without recirculation, and the\nreplacement entry air does not contain dangerous air contaminants, but does\ncontain sufficient oxygen. The provisions of this paragraph shall also apply to\nthe exhausting of an inert atmosphere. (7)\n\nAny person entering a confined space\nshall be provided with and shall use the following additional safety equipment: (i) Where the least dimension of any access\nopening to a confined space is less than 24 inches, approved wrist straps or\napproved noose-type wristlets shall be worn. Where the least dimension of such\naccess opening is greater than 24 inches, either an approved life belt, approved safety harness, approved wrist straps or approved noose-type wristlets\nshall be worn. (ii)\nA lifeline, as\nspecified by the provisions of Industrial Code Part (Rule No.) 23, shall be\nattached to such life belt, approved safety harness, approved wrist straps or\napproved noose-type wristlets with the other end securely anchored outside the\nconfined space. Exception:Where such a lifeline attached to approved\nwrist straps or approved noose-type wristlets interferes with the performance\nof the work duties of the person occupying the confined space, such lifeline\ncomplete with safety snaps may be disconnected from the wrist straps or\nwristlets provided the lifeline safety snap remains within three feet of the\nperson in the confined space for quick attachment to the wrist straps or\nwristlets. (iii)\nA safe\nmeans of ingress and egress, such as a portable ladder, provided such means\nwill not obstruct the access opening. (iv)\n\nAn explosion-proof battery-operated\nportable light in good working order. (v) Non-sparking striking, chipping, hammering or cutting tools and equipment where the confined space may contain\nexplosive or flammable air contaminants. (c) Safety monitors. (1)\nA person designated as a safety monitor\nshall be stationed at the access opening of any confined space while such space\nis occupied for any reason. The safety monitor shall maintain visual contact\nwith every occupant in the confined space where the construction of the\nconfined space permits, or shall have continuous knowledge of the activities\nand well-being of every occupant of the confined space via verbal communication\nor other positive means at all times. Such safety monitor may assist an\noccupant of a confined space in such light duties as handling tools or supplies\nor removing containers of refuse or debris provided that these tasks do not\ninterfere with his primary duty as a safety monitor. (2)\n\nThe safety monitor shall be an alert, competent person, fully capable of quickly summoning the assistance of a person\nor rescue team for the administration of emergency first aid treatment if\nrequired. (3)\n\nThe safety monitor\nmust be physically able to assist such summoned person or rescue team in the\nextrication of an occupant from a confined space under emergency\nconditions. (4)\n\nThe following\nemergency equipment shall be available to the safety monitor or rescue\npersonnel for use if required. (i) Approved\nair line respirator, approved hose mask or approved self-contained breathing\napparatus. (ii)\n\nExplosion-proof\nbattery-operated portable light in good working order. (iii)\n\nSafety equipment as specified in\nsubpart 12-1, section\n12-1.9, subdivision (b), paragraph\n(7), subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this Part (rule). (5)\n\nSuch emergency equipment shall be located\nat the access opening of the confined space or not more than 15 feet from such\nopening. (d) Operations\nrequiring continuous testing. If the nature of the work to be performed\nproduces or has the potential to produce dangerous air contaminants as\nspecified in this Part (rule), continuous testing shall be performed. If such\ntests indicate evidence of dangerous air contaminants exceeding the\nconcentrations listed in subpart 12-3 of this Part (rule) or in quantities\ngreater than 25 percent of the lower explosive level, the occupants shall be\nordered to evacuate the confined space immediately. (e) External alarm signal. Outside of every\noccupied confined space there shall be an audible alarm signal device located\nwithin 15 feet of the access opening. Such device may be of the portable type\nand shall be maintained in good working order. When actuated, such audible\nalarm shall be louder than the general background noise level and should be\ncapable of being heard clearly by any person located within 100 feet of the\naccess opening. In case of an emergency in a confined space, the safety monitor\nshall immediately actuate the alarm signal. In no case shall the safety monitor\nor other rescue personnel enter the confined space without first actuating the\nalarm signal and, secondly, putting on his personal protective\nequipment. (f) Illumination. There\nshall be installed and maintained an independent substitute emergency lighting\nsystem in addition to the principal lighting system in any area where a\nconfined space is located and which is entered frequently for cleaning and\nmaintenance purposes. Such substitute emergency lighting system shall operate\nautomatically upon failure of the principal system and shall be capable of\nproviding distinct illumination for a period of at least 30 minutes of all\naccess openings of confined spaces as well as of the general surrounding area\nand exits. Whenever the principal lighting system fails, the confined spaces\nshall be evacuated immediately. Where any confined space is to be entered\ninfrequently for inspection or similar purposes, sufficient quantities of\nbattery-powered lights in good working order shall be provided to afford\ndistinct illumination at every access opening and its surrounding area and\nexit. These lights shall be capable of providing illumination for a period of\ntime of at least one hour. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
