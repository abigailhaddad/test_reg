  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 234.4 - Testing and monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Printing\nprocesses that use control equipment to comply with the provisions of this Part\nmust test and monitor the control equipment to ensure the overall removal\nefficiency. Test methods included in this section must be used to demonstrate\nthe overall removal efficiency. (1)\n\nFor\ncontrol equipment that uses VOC/solvent recovery, overall removal efficiency\nmust be demonstrated using methods described in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of\nthis section. (2)\n\nFor control\nequipment other than VOC/solvent recovery, the chosen demonstration method must\ninclude provisions to determine the overall removal efficiency. (b) The owner or operator of a\nprinting process subject to this Part must follow notification requirements and\ntest procedures in Subpart 202-1 of this Title. (1)\n\nOne of the following test methods from\nappendix A of 40 CFR\n60\n(see Table l, section\n200.9\nof this Title) must be used\nto measure the VOC concentration of a gas stream at the inlet and outlet of the\ncontrol equipment: (i) method 18, Measurement\nof Gaseous Organic Compound Emissions by Gas Chromatography; (ii)\nmethod 25, Determination of Total\n\nGaseous Non-Methane Organic Emissions as Carbon; or\n(iii)\nmethod 25A, Determination of Total\n\nGaseous Organic Concentration Using a Flame Ionization Analyzer; (iv)\nmethods not listed above must be\napproved in advance by the Department and the United States Environmental\n\nProtection Agency. (2)\n\nAcceptable analytical methods for determining the VOC content, water content, density, volume of solids and weight of solids of surface coatings and printing\ninks are presented in appendix A, methods 24 and 24A (as appropriate), of 40\nCFR\n60\n(see Table l, section\n200.9\nof this Title). Alternate\nanalytical methods for surface coating and printing ink analysis must be\napproved by the department and the United States Environmental Protection\n\nAgency. Instead of analytical methods, the department may accept the\nmanufacturer's certification of VOC content of ink coating or adhesives, if\nsupported by actual batch records. (c) Continuous control equipment monitors for\nthe following parameters must be installed, periodically calibrated, and\noperated at all times that the associated control equipment is operated: (1)\ncombustion zone temperature of all\noxidizers; (2)\ninlet temperature at\nthe catalytic oxidizer bed; (3)\nbreak-through of VOC on a carbon adsorption unit; and\n(4)\nany other continuous monitoring or\nrecording device required by the department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n234.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
