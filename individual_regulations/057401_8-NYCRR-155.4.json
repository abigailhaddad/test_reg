  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 155.4 - Uniform code of public school building inspections, safety rating and monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Short\ntitle and application. This section, promulgated pursuant to sections\n409-d, 409-e, 3602\n(6)\nand (6-e) and\n3641\n(4)\nof the Education Law, shall be known as\nthe Uniform Code of Public School Building Inspections, Safety Rating and\n\nMonitoring (hereinafter referred to as the code), and shall consist of three\ncomponents: procedures for periodic inspections, a safety rating system and a\nmonitoring system. The provisions of this section shall apply to all occupied\npublic school buildings, provided that nothing herein shall prevent a school\ndistrict or board of cooperative educational services from adopting stricter\nlocal codes. Such local code must meet or surpass all requirements of the code. Nothing herein shall affect a separate requirement to inspect and maintain\nschool buildings pursuant to any other State or local law or\nregulation. (b) Procedures for\nperiodic inspections. To ensure that all occupied public school buildings are\nproperly maintained and preserved and provide a suitable educational setting, the board of education of each school district or board of cooperative\neducational services (BOCES) shall cause such facilities owned, operated or\nleased by the school district or BOCES to be assessed in accordance with\nsections\n409-d\nand\n409-e\nof the\n\nEducation Law and this section, and, where applicable, section\n807-a\nof the\n\nEducation Law and section\n155.8\nof this Part. Buildings shall\nbe assessed by a building condition survey conducted once every five years, an\nannual fire safety inspection conducted pursuant to section\n807-a\nof the\n\nEducation Law and section\n155.8\nof this Part or pursuant to\nlocal law or codes, and a visual inspection conducted in years 2020 and 2022 to\nthe extent required in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. The commissioner may\nrequire additional visual inspections as deemed necessary to maintain the\nsafety of public school buildings and the welfare of the occupants. (1)\n\nBuilding condition surveys. School\ndistricts and BOCES shall conduct a building condition survey for all occupied\npublic school buildings in calendar years 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023 or 2024 on a\nschedule prescribed pursuant to this paragraph and at least every five years\nthereafter. Such schedule shall assign districts to Labor Market Regions\n(Capital Region, Central NY, Finger Lakes, Hudson Valley, Long Island, Mohawk\n\nValley, North Country, Southern Tier and Western NY) and shall use data\nregarding the number of occupied buildings for each district to equally\ndistribute the number of buildings to be surveyed within each Labor Market\n\nRegion in each scheduled assignment year, and shall use data from the 2015\n\nBuilding Condition Survey to the greatest extent practicable to assign\ndistricts with the highest number of buildings rated unsatisfactory or poor to\nthe first two years of the assignment schedule while at the same time ensuring\na pro-rated staggered implementation schedule within each Labor Market Region. (i) The physical inspections required to\ncomplete the survey shall be conducted by a team that includes at least one\nlicensed architect or engineer. The Commissioner of Education shall prescribe\nthe format required to complete the survey. (ii)\n\nThe survey shall include, but not be\nlimited to list of all program spaces and an inspection of the following\nbuilding system components for evidence of movement, deterioration, structural\nfailure, probable useful life, need for repair and maintenance and need for\nreplacement: (a) the building site, including\nutilities, paving, playgrounds, and play fields; (b) roofing; (c) exterior elements of the building, including walls, doors, windows, fire escapes; (d) building structural elements; (e) building interiors, including finishes, doors, and hardware; (f) electrical\nsystems, including service and distribution, lighting, communications, technology infrastructure and cabling; (g) plumbing, including water distribution\nsystem, drainage system, and fixtures; (h) heating and cooling systems, including\nboilers, furnaces, terminal units, and control systems; (i) ventilation systems; (j) air conditioning systems, including\nrefrigeration, terminal units, and control systems; (k) special construction, including stairs, elevators, escalators, and swimming pools; (l) fire protection and security systems, including alarm, detection and fire protection; and\n(m) environmental features, including\nappearance, cleanliness, acoustics, lighting quality, thermal comfort, humidity, ventilation and space adequacy. (iii)\n\nReports of building condition surveys, signed and sealed by the licensed architect or engineer, shall be submitted to\nthe commissioner by March 1st following the calendar year the building\ncondition survey is due pursuant to the staggered schedule set forth in this\nparagraph and March 1st of every fifth year thereafter. Building aid computed\npursuant to section\n3602\n(6-e)\nof the Education Law is available for\nbuilding condition surveys conducted by a licensed architect or engineer if no\nclaim for such a building condition survey in such a building has been filed in\nthe previous five years. The apportionment of such building aid for each school\nbuilding so inspected by a school district in the base year shall not exceed\nthe lesser of the product of the building aid ratio and the actual cost, or the\nbuilding condition survey aid ceiling computed by the commissioner. For aid\npayable in the 2000-2001 school year and thereafter, the building condition\nsurvey aid ceiling shall be the product of 20 cents plus an additional amount\ntimes the gross area of the building. Such additional amount shall be the\nresult obtained when the cost of labor and material index determined by the New\n\nYork State Department of Labor for the month of July of the current year is\ndivided by the cost index for July 1999 and the result is rounded to two\ndecimal places. A claim for building aid shall be made in a form prescribed by\nthe commissioner, within six months of the date of the architect or engineer\nreport, for aid payable in the following school year. Such reports shall be\nmade available to the public on request. (2)\n\nVisual inspections. (i) A visual inspection of every occupied\npublic school building shall be conducted at least once in calendar year 2020\nprovided, however, that such visual inspection shall not be required where a\nbuilding condition survey was conducted pursuant to the staggered schedule set\nforth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision in calendar year 2020. A visual\ninspection of every occupied public school building shall also be conducted at\nleast once in calendar year 2022 provided, however, that such visual inspection\nshall not be required where a building condition survey was conducted pursuant\nto the staggered schedule set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision in\ncalendar years 2020, 2021, or 2022. The commissioner may require inspections of\npublic school buildings as deemed necessary to maintain the safety of public\nschool buildings and the welfare of their occupants. (ii)\n\nThe visual inspection shall consist of a\nvisual re-inspection of the components of the building condition survey for\nchanges that may have occurred and a review and update of the safety rating as\nneeded. (iii)\n\nThe visual inspection\nshall be conducted by a team composed of a person certified by the Department\nof State as a code enforcement official, or in the case of the City of New\n\nYork, a person certified by the New York City Building Department as a local\ncode enforcement official, the district director of facilities or his or her\ndesignee, and a member of the health and safety committee required pursuant to\nsubdivision (d) of this section. (iv)\n\nIf a visual inspection results in a\ndetermination that the building may have a deficiency that would result in a\ndetermination pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section that the safety\nrating of the building is unsatisfactory or unsafe/unhealthful, the board of\neducation or board of cooperative educational services shall retain a licensed\narchitect or engineer to perform a detailed inspection and develop a corrective\naction plan. In addition, the commissioner may require a board of education or\nboard of cooperative educational services to conduct a detailed inspection by a\nlicensed architect or engineer where the commissioner determines that: (a) the school district or board of\ncooperative educational services has provided insufficient spending for\nmaintenance, repair or capital renewal of the building; or\n(b) the school provides a poor learning\nenvironment pursuant to section\n100.2\n(p) of this\n\nTitle. (v) Visual\ninspections shall be completed by December 31st of calendar years 2020 and 2022\npursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (vi)\n\nThe results of the visual inspection of\nall occupied public school buildings shall be reported to the commissioner on\nforms prescribed by the commissioner, shall be signed by the person or persons\nwho conducted the inspection and shall be filed with the commissioner within 60\ndays of the completion of the inspection. Such reports shall indicate if more\ninspections and repairs are necessary to protect the health and safety of\nstudents and staff occupying such school buildings. Visual inspection reports\nshall be made available to the public. (vii)\n\nAny person, or any public or other\ncorporation for which any such person acts, shall not be liable for any error, omission or lack of thoroughness in the making of the inspection and report\nrequired or permitted by this section. (c) Safety rating system. Each school\ndistrict and board of cooperative educational services shall provide for the\nsafety rating of all occupied school buildings keyed to the structural\nintegrity and overall safety of the building on an annual basis. (1)\n\nThe safety rating shall be established by\neach district or board of cooperative educational services after consultation\nwith the health and safety committee established pursuant to paragraph (d)(1)\nof this section and shall identify and assess the condition of every major\nsystem component of each occupied school building based upon overall assessment\nof the system or element, probable useful life, structural integrity, overall\nsafety, need for repair and maintenance, need for replacement, the estimated\ncost of necessary repairs and/or replacement, and assessment of the\neffectiveness of the building comprehensive maintenance plan required by\nparagraph (d)(1) of this section.
