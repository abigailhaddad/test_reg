  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 128-3.15 - Snow disposal and storage and use of winter highway maintenance materials\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Whenever feasible removed snow shall not be disposed of directly into a watercourse, wetland, reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake. However, this subdivision shall not be construed to require an owner or operator to transport the removed snow in a vehicle for offsite disposal. (b) No snow disposal activity shall be considered to be a noncomplying regulated activity. (c) Commercial, industrial, governmental, or institutional entities shall be restricted to the use of the substances defined in these rules and regulations as winter highway maintenance materials and to the use of the minimum amount needed of such substances in order to protect the public safety. In determining the minimum amount needed for public safety, such entities should consider best management practices developed by the New York State Department of Transportation. (d) (1)\n\nCommercial, industrial, governmental, or institutional entities that store winter highway maintenance materials in quantities of 1,000 pounds or more that contain greater than eight percent chloride compounds shall store such materials in structures constructed on low permeability storage pads. (2)\n\nAny outdoor areas used for loading, handling or mixing of winter highway maintenance materials shall be constructed and maintained to prevent seepage and runoff from entering any watercourse, wetland, reservoir, reservoir stem or controlled lake. (e) All commercial, industrial, governmental, or institutional entities that store winter highway maintenance materials in quantities and composition not otherwise subject to paragraph (d)(1) of this section, shall store such materials in a manner that minimizes runoff into any watercourse, wetland, reservoir, reservoir stem, or controlled lake. Runoff may be controlled by use of control measures such as berms and covers. (f) A winter highway maintenance material storage facility may be enlarged provided that the enlarged facility is in compliance with the storage requirements set forth in this section, and any other applicable requirements of these rules and regulations. (g) Winter highway maintenance material storage facilities that are noncomplying regulated activities shall come into compliance with this section no later than two years from the effective date of these rules and regulations.
