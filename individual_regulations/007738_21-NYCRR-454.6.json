In the case of contracts with electric corporations entered into on or after\n\nMay 1, 1974, failure to make prompt and timely payments of all bills rendered\nby authority for electric service shall be grounds for immediate termination\npursuant to section\n1005\n(e) of Public Authorities Law. Such\ndiscontinuance of electric service will not relieve customer of liability for\nany minimum charge during the time electric service is so discontinued. The\nrights given in this subdivision to authority shall be in addition to all other\nremedies available to authority, either at law or in equity, for the breach of\nany of the provisions of this subdivision. (c) Adjustment for fractional billing period.
