  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-11.1 - In-plant operations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Air sampling and analysis. Air sampling and analysis on all asbestos projects\nconducted under this section shall be conducted in accordance with the\nrequirements of Subpart 56-4 of this Part. (b) Where allowed. In-plant operations permissible under this Subpart are\nonly those that meet all of the following criteria: (1)\n\nAny work within the premises of an\nemployer other than the State, any political subdivision of the State, a public\nauthority or other governmental agency or instrumentality thereof, in an area\nto which persons other than those directly involved in the work shall not have\naccess during the course of the work, and which is performed in a manner\nconsistent with Federal regulations promulgated under the Federal Occupational\n\nSafety and Health Act, pursuant to chapter\n15\nof title 29 of the United States\n\nCode and is performed in a manner which shall not expose the public to airborne\nfibers in excess of background levels or.01 fiber per cubic centimeter, whichever is greater, provided that the work involves the encapsulation, enclosure, removal, repair, disturbance or handling of: (i) less than 160 square feet or 260 linear\nfeet of ACM, PACM, or asbestos material and is performed by employees of such\nemployer; or\n(ii)\nany quantity of\nnon-friable organically bound (NOB) asbestos material currently in a\nnon-friable intact condition, provided the abatement methods will not render\nthe asbestos material friable during abatement. Only ELAP approved laboratories\ncompliant with section\n56-4.2\nof this Part, can make the\ndetermination that bulk samples of a non-friable suspect ACM are NOB asbestos\nmaterials. (c) Limitations. The \"in-plant operations\" exception created in section\n901\n(12)\nof the Labor Law is limited in\nscope. (1)\n\nThere is no exemption from\nrequirements for licensing and certification set forth elsewhere in this Part. See Subpart 56-3 of this Part. (2)\n\nThere is no exemption from air sampling or asbestos survey requirements set\nforth in this Part. See Subparts 56-4 and 56-5 of this Part. (3)\n\nThere is no exemption from requirements\nfor project notification or from notice to residents or occupants set forth in\nthis Part. See sections\n56-3.4, 56-3.5 and\n56-3.6\nof this Part, respectively. (4)\n\nThere is no\nexemption from recordkeeping requirements of Labor Law, section 904 and section\n56-3.4\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (5)\n\nFor all of these\npurposes, in-plant operations are asbestos projects as defined in section\n56-2.1\nof this Part. (6)\n\nThere is a limited exemption from other\n\nCode Rule 56 work practices where all of the following conditions are met: (i) the project takes place within the\npremises of the nonpublic employer; (ii)\nthe project takes place in an area to\nwhich persons other than those directly involved in the work shall not have\naccess during the course of the work; (iii)\nthe project is performed in a manner\nconsistent with current OSHA regulations; (iv)\nthe project is performed in a manner\nwhich shall not expose the public to airborne fiber concentrations exceeding\nbackground levels or.01 fiber per cubic centimeter, whichever is greater; and\n(v) the project: (a) involves encapsulation, enclosure, removal, repair, disturbance or handling of less than 160 square feet or 260\nlinear feet of ACM, PACM or asbestos material and work is performed by\nemployees of the employer; or\n(b) involves the encapsulation, enclosure, removal, disturbance, repair or handling\nof NOB asbestos materials. If the materials listed in this clause are involved\nand no asbestos material will be rendered friable during abatement, an employer\nmay employ an outside asbestos abatement contractor (\ni.e., the\nwork need not be performed by employees of such employer). (d) In-plant\noperations regulated abatement work area. Every location where an in-plant operation is performed\nshall be considered to be a regulated abatement work area for purposes of this\n\nSubpart. (e) Licensing, notification and certification. Asbestos contractors and other individuals engaged in\nasbestos projects conducted under this Subpart shall comply with the\nrequirements of Subpart 56-3 of this Part. (f) Failure to meet \"in-plant\noperations\" criteria. If, at any time prior to, during or subsequent to the\nasbestos project, conditions are such that any of the criteria of subdivision\n(c) of this section are not met, all anticipated, current and further work or\nactivity on such project shall be conducted in accordance with all requirements\nof Industrial Code Rule 56.
