  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 324.4 - PARs confirming consistency with MTG or medical necessity when no MTG\nState Regulations\n(a) Every insurance\ncarrier, self-insured employer and third-party administrator shall designate a\nqualified employee or employees as a point of contact for the Board and\n\nTreating Medical Providers regarding PARs to confirm consistency with the\n\nMedical Treatment Guidelines or medical necessity. Insurance carriers, self-insured employers and third-party administrators shall provide the Chair\nor his or her designee in the manner prescribed by the Chair with the name and\ncontact information for the point(s) of contact for PARs to confirm consistency\nwith the Medical Treatment Guidelines (PAR: MTG Confirmation) or review for\nmedical necessity (PAR: Non-MTG $1,000 or Under). Such contact information may include the contacts' direct\ntelephone number(s) and email address(es). 1. If the designated point(s) of contact\nchanges at any time for any reason, the insurance carrier, self-insured\nemployer or third-party administrator shall notify the Chair or his or her\ndesignee of such change in the manner prescribed by the Chair. 2. The list of designated points of contact\nfor each insurance carrier, self-insured employer and third-party administrator\nshall be maintained by the Board electronically. When a treating medical\nprovider submits a PAR electronically, it shall be directed to the appropriate\ncontact person. Any change in the designated contact shall not be effective\nuntil the designated contact information has been updated in the Board's\nelectronic records. 3. In the event\nthat an insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator\nfails to so provide the Chair or his or her designee with such name and contact\ninformation (in the manner prescribed), or provides incorrect or incomplete\ncontact information during initial registration or when updating pursuant to\nsubparagraph (1) of this subdivision, such insurance carrier, self-insured\nemployer or third-party administrator may be subject to: i. Orders of the Chair granting any PAR\nsubmitted during such time when the name and contact information is missing, incomplete or incorrect; and\nii. Penalties issued pursuant to section\n114-a\n(3)\nof the Workers' Compensation Law for\nevery case, where a PAR was requested. (b) Submission by Medical provider\n(1)\n\nThe Treating Medical Provider has the\noption of submitting a PAR to the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or\nthird-party administrator to confirm that the proposed medical care is\nconsistent with the Medical Treatment Guidelines. (2)\n\nIf there is no applicable Medical\n\nTreatment Guideline and the cost of the requested treatment is less than $1000\nin the aggregate, the Treating Medical Provider has the option of submitting a\nPAR to the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party\nadministrator for such causally related medically necessary treatment and care. To request to confirm consistency with the Medical Treatment Guidelines (PAR: MTG Confirmation) or medical necessity (PAR: Non-MTG $1,000 or Under), the\n\nTreating Medical Provider shall submit the request in the manner prescribed by\nthe Board. The PAR to confirm consistency with the Medical Treatment\n\nGuidelines or medical necessity request shall be in the format prescribed by\nthe Chair which may be electronic. (c) The insurance carrier, self-insured\nemployer or third-party administrator has eight business days from submission\nof the PAR to confirm consistency with the Medical Treatment Guidelines or\nmedical necessity, and to approve or deny the medical care. The carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator shall send the claimant\nnotice of the approval, partial approval or denial of the PAR. Failure to send\nthe claimant such notice may result in penalties under section 25(3)(e), for\nfailure to file a required report with the Board, and section\n13-a\n(6)(a)\nof the Workers' Compensation Law. In\nthe event the PAR is submitted prior to creation of a workers' compensation\ncase by the Board in accordance with 300.37(a) of this Chapter, the PAR will be\npromptly reviewed by the Board to identify the proper carrier, self-insured\nemployer or third-party administrator. Upon such identification, the PAR will\nbe directed by the Board to the proper carrier, self-insured employer, or\nthird-party administrator, who shall have 15 calendar days (or 30 calendar days\nin the event of an IME) to approve, partially approve or deny the request. In\nthe event the PAR is submitted after creation of a workers' compensation case\nby the Board in accordance with 300.37(a) of this Chapter but prior to filing\nthe mandatory first report of injury pursuant to section\n300.22\n(b) of this\n\nChapter that identifies a third-party administrator responsible for handling\nthe claim, the request may be directed to a third-party administrator that has\nbeen designated by the carrier or self-insured employer as handling all or a\nportion of its workers' compensation claims and identified by the Board as the\nthird-party administrator where such requests will be directed. Such\nthird-party administrator shall have 8 business days to approve, partially\napprove or deny the request. In the event the PAR is submitted after the\nmandatory first report of injury pursuant to section\n300.22\n(b) of this\n\nChapter shall become due and no such report has been filed, the Board may issue\nan Order of the Chair or Notice of Resolution granting the requested treatment. Unless the PAR is made in a case that has been closed, disallowed or cancelled, where ongoing medical treatment is resolved by an\nagreement pursuant to section\n32\nof\nthe Workers' Compensation Law, or controverted in accordance with section\n300.22\n(b)(1)(ii) or\n(c)(1)\nof this Chapter, any PAR must be\nreviewed by the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party\nadministrator Carrier's Physician before it may be denied or partially\napproved. When an insurance carrier, self-insured employer, or third-party\nadministrator denies or partially approves a PAR, the insurance carrier, self-insured employer, or third-party administrator must also assert any other\nbasis for denial or such basis for denial will be deemed waived. Except as set\nforth in subparagraph (2) below, all denials or partial approvals must be made\nby the Carrier's Physician. A partial approval limits the length of time or\nfrequency of the treatment, or authorizes a related but different treatment\nthan that requested in the PAR. (1)\n\nIf the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator\nagrees that the medical care for which a PAR is requested is consistent with\nthe Medical Treatment Guidelines or is medically necessary, it shall respond in\nthe format prescribed by the Chair. (2)\n\nThe insurance carrier, self-insured\nemployer or third-party administrator may deny a PAR without review by the\n\nCarrier's Physician when a case is closed, disallowed or cancelled, where\nongoing medical treatment is resolved by an agreement pursuant to section\n32\nof\nthe Workers' Compensation Law, or controverted in accordance with section\n300.22\n(b)(1)(ii) or\n(c)(1)\nof this Chapter. (i) Nothing herein shall prohibit an\ninsurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator from\nobtaining an opinion from an independent medical examiner. (ii)\n\nWhen a PAR is denied without review by\n\nCarrier's Physician there shall be no review by the Medical Director's Office. A claimant may request review by the Board by filing a Request for Further\n\nAction, that demonstrates that the basis for denial is factually inaccurate. The Board may respond to such requests for review by letter or by referral to\nadjudication, as appropriate in the discretion of the Chair or his or her\ndesignee. (3)\nA denial\nof the PAR for reasons other than those set forth in subparagraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, or an approval that concedes medical necessity but does not affirm\nthat the approved medical care will be paid at the fee schedule rate, must be\nreviewed by the Carrier's Physician. A denial issued by other than a Carrier's\n\nPhysician is not valid and may be deemed approved by the Board. Invalid denials\nmay be subject to penalties pursuant to sections\n13-a\n(6)(a)\nand\n114-a\n(3)\nof the Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw. (4)\n\nIf the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator concedes the medical\nnecessity of the medical care, it may grant without liability, only if the case\nhas been controverted in accordance with section\n300.22\n(b)(1)(ii) or\n(c)(1)\nof this Chapter, or the medical care\nis for a body part or condition that has not been accepted by the insurance\ncarrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator or established by\nthe Board. (5)\n\nIf the insurance\ncarrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator fails to respond to\na PAR within eight business days, the medical care may be deemed approved on\nthe ground that approval was unreasonably withheld and the Chair will issue an\norder stating that the request is approved. In addition, the carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator shall be subject to a\npenalty pursuant to section\n25\n(3)(e)\nof the Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw. (d) If a claim is\ncontroverted or the time to controvert the claim has not expired, and the\ninsurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator agrees\nthat the medical care for which a PAR is requested is consistent with the\n\nMedical Treatment Guidelines or is medically necessary, such agreement shall\nnot be construed as an admission that the condition for which the PAR is\nrequested is compensable and the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or\nthird-party administrator is not liable for the cost of such treatment unless\nthe claim or condition is established. (e) For requests made pursuant to (b)(1)\nherein, if the insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party\nadministrator denies that the medical care for which a PAR is requested is\nconsistent with the Medical Treatment Guidelines, the Treating Medical Provider\nmay elect to submit a PAR (PAR: MTG Variance) in accordance with section\n324.3\nof this Part or submit a\nrequest for review. The Treating Medical Provider may request review of the\ndenial of the PAR within 10 calendar days of the date of the denial by\nsubmission of the request in the format prescribed by the Chair which may be\nelectronic. The Medical Director's Office shall rule on whether the medical\ncare is consistent with the Medical Treatment Guidelines and issue a notice of\nresolution setting forth the ruling and the basis for such ruling. Such notice\nof resolution is binding and not appealable under Workers' Compensation Law\n\nSection 23. (f) For\nrequests made pursuant to (b)(2) herein, if the insurance carrier, self-insured\nemployer or third-party administrator denies that the medical care for which\nprior approval is requested is causally related or medically necessary, the\n\nTreating Medical Provider may submit a request for review in the format\nprescribed by the Chair. Upon the request of the Treating Medical Provider, the\nPAR and denial will be referred to conciliation for a determination as to\nwhether the medical care is causally related and medically necessary. Conciliation shall issue a proposed conciliation decision setting forth the\nruling and the basis for such ruling. The claimant and insurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator may object to the proposed\nconciliation decision within thirty calendar days in accordance with part 312\nof this Chapter. The Treating Medical Provider may not object to the proposed\nconciliation decision. (g) An\ninsurance carrier, self-insured employer or third-party administrator may not\ndispute a bill for medical care on the basis that it was not consistent with\nthe Medical Treatment Guidelines or that it was not causally related or\nmedically necessary, if it has approved a request for prior approval for such\nmedical care or the Board has issued a decision approving the treatment or an\n\nOrder of the Chair. (h) An\ninsurance carrier, self-insured employer, or third-party administrator may not\nobject to or deny payment of a medical bill solely because the treating medical\nprovider did not submit a PAR under this section prior to rendering treatment. Denial of a medical bill solely for this reason may result in a penalty\npursuant to sections 13-a(6) and 114-a(3). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
