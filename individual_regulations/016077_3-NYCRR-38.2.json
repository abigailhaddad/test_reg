Business cards, letterhead and general electronic media\ncommunications, to the extent that they are not used for general advertising\npurposes, need not include the legend. (b) Any advertisement by a mortgage broker, mortgage banker or exempt organization in print or electronic media must\nindicate the name of the entity and a street address of any one of its offices\nin New York State or, if the entity is not located in New York State, the\nstreet address of any one office outside New York. This requirement will not\napply to advertisements made by a mortgage broker, mortgage banker or exempt\norganization having more than 10 offices in New York State. (c) No mortgage loan products may be\nadvertised by a mortgage broker, mortgage banker or exempt organization unless\nthe entity has the advertised product available to a reasonable number of\nqualified applicants responding to the advertisement on the date the\nadvertisement appears, or the entity's next business day. Nothing in this\nsection shall require a lender to make a loan to an unqualified applicant. This\nrequirement shall not be deemed to be violated if the aggregate principal\namount of the advertised product available to all applicants is limited to the\namount specified in an agreement between the entity and a third person (e.g., State mortgage agency) to sell such product to the third person, and the entity\ndiscloses in the advertisement for such product that the availability of such\nproduct is limited.

Any advertisement\nby a mortgage broker must contain a statement to the effect that the mortgage\nbroker arranges mortgage loans with third-party providers. (e) No mortgage broker, mortgage banker or\nexempt organization shall fraudulently or deceitfully advertise a mortgage\nloan, or misrepresent the terms, conditions or charges incident to a mortgage\nloan in any advertisement therefor.

(f) Every mortgage broker, mortgage banker\nand exempt organization shall maintain a record of samples of its\nadvertisements (including commercial scripts of all radio broadcasts, television broadcasts and electronic media) for examination by the\nsuperintendent for a period of two years from the date of\npublication.
