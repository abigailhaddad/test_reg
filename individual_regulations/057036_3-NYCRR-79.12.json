If the mortgagor fails to\nchoose a property insurer(s) in a timely manner or if the insurer(s) is not\nacceptable to the mortgagee, then the mortgagee may insure the property with a\ncarrier(s) of its choice in accordance with 11 NYCRR Part\n227. (b) Notwithstanding applicable state or\nfederal rule or law, the mortgagee may advance the funds necessary to pay\nproperty insurance premiums or real estate taxes under the following\ncircumstances: (1)\nthe borrower's payment of\nsuch property charges is already more than 30 days overdue; (2)\nthe reverse mortgage loan has already\nbeen called due and payable; or\n(3)\na set aside account has been established and the taxing jurisdiction offers a\ndiscount for disbursements on a lump sum annual basis or imposes an additional\ncharge or fee for installment disbursements and the mortgagee has chosen to\ntake advantage of the discount for the borrower or avoid the additional charge\nor fee for installments. (c) Notwithstanding applicable state or\nfederal rule or law, a mortgagee that chooses to advance funds in accordance\nwith subsection (b) above may then reimburse itself in any of following\nindividual or combined ways: (1)\nby deducting\nnecessary amounts from a line of credit; (2)\nby withholding from one or more monthly\npayments otherwise due to the mortgagor no more than 25 percent of each such\nmonthly payment, until such time as the amount paid is realized; or\n(3)\nby adding the amount to the loan\nprincipal. If a set aside account has been established, then, to the\nextent possible, the mortgagee must reimburse itself from such fund before\nchoosing option (2) or (3) (paragraph or of this subdivision).
