Tit. 10 § 118.2 - Village of Catskill\n\nState Regulations\n(a) [Application.] The rules and regulations hereinafter given, duly made and enacted in accordance with the provisions of sections 70, 71 and 73 of chapter 45 of the Consolidated Laws (Public Health Law), as amended by chapter 395 of the Laws of 1928, shall apply to all natural and artificial reservoirs on the west branch of Potuck Creek (Cob Creek on U. S. Geological Survey Sheet) and to all watercourses and drainage areas tributary thereto or ultimately discharging into said reservoirs, such bodies of water being sources of the public water supply of the village of Catskill, Greene County, New York. (b) [Definitions.]\n(1)\n\nThe term reservoir wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to the impounding and storage reservoir on Potuck Creek, which serves as the source of the aforesaid public water supply, and to any additional reservoir which may hereafter be constructed or used for the purpose of this public water supply. (2)\n\nThe term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and include every spring, pond, lake (other than artificial reservoirs and filter basins), stream, ditch, gutter or channel of any kind, the waters of which, when running, whether continuously or occasionally, eventually flow or may flow into the public water supply of the village of Catskill. (3)\n\nWherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a reservoir or from a watercourse is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the highwater mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (c) Privies adjacent to any reservoir or watercourse. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind, placed or used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta, shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 200 feet of any reservoir or 50 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Catskill, except a properly constructed and operated sewage disposal plant, as hereinafter set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d), provided, however, that the property on which the privy, privy vault, pit or any other receptacle intended for the deposit of human excreta is built or is to be built is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distance above named can be obtained within the limits of such property. (2)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle, used or intended for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta and built on property which is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distance prescribed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision cannot be obtained within the limits of such property, shall be placed as far as possible from any reservoir or watercourse and specially constructed of masonry, concrete or metal to form a watertight receptacle from which no outward percolation can take place. Where removable watertight containers are provided, they shall be located as far as practicable from any reservoir or watercourse. All privies or receptacles referred to in this paragraph shall be constructed or installed only with the approval and under the supervision of the board of water commissioners of the village of Catskill and so located that the top of such receptacles shall be above the highest known water level of the reservoir or watercourse. (3)\n\nWhenever a privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind or any vessel, can or other container, used for either the temporary storage or the permanent disposal of human excreta, is specially constructed and made watertight and located nearer any reservoir or watercourse than the distances prescribed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, such receptacles shall be emptied at regular intervals and disinfected as often as may be necessary to maintain them in a proper sanitary condition and effectually to prevent any overflow. The work of emptying and disinfecting these receptacles shall be done under the supervision of or in accordance with the direction of the board of water commissioners and in such manner as to effectually prevent any pollution of the water supply of the village of Catskill. (4)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or other receptacle, which is not watertight, placed or used for the permanent deposit of human excreta, shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 300 feet of any reservoir or 100 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Catskill. (5)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind, placed or used for the temporary storage of human excreta, located between the limiting distances prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distances prescribed by paragraph (4) of this subdivision, shall be arranged in such a manner that all excreta shall be received in a suitable watertight receptacle or removable container which shall be emptied as set forth in paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subdivision. (6)\n\nWhenever the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers become filled within six inches of the top, said receptacles or containers shall be emptied or removed and the contents disposed of as hereinafter provided, in order to maintain the privy or receptacle in proper sanitary condition and effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transported from the privy or receptacle to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents or the removable containers, while being transported, be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises or the adjacent premises. (7)\n\nUnless otherwise specifically ordered or permitted by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers permitted under paragraph (5) of this subdivision shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits and covered with not less than 12 inches of soil in such a manner as effectually to prevent their being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at a distance of not less than 400 feet from any reservoir or 150 feet from any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Catskill. (8)\n\nWhenever it shall be found that, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or owing to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local conditions, excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal may, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, be washed over the surface of the ground or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any reservoir or watercourse, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the said trench or place of disposal shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health. (d) Sewage, sink wastes, garbage, etc. (1)\n\nNo bath water, laundry wastes, sewage or other excremental matter from any water closet, privy, cesspool or other source, except the effluent from a properly constructed and operated sewage disposal plant as hereinafter provided by paragraph (2) of this subdivision, shall be thrown, placed, led, conducted, discharged or allowed to escape or flow in any manner, either directly or indirectly, into any reservoir or any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Catskill, nor shall any such liquid or solid matters be thrown, placed, led, conducted, discharged or allowed to escape or flow onto the surface of the ground or into the ground beneath the surface (except into watertight receptacles or removable containers, the contents of which are to be removed as provided by paragraphs [6] and [7] of subdivision [c]) within 300 feet of any reservoir or 100 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Catskill. (2)\n\nNo sewage disposal plant, the effluent from which is to be discharged or allowed to flow directly or indirectly into the west branch of Potuck Creek or any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Catskill, shall be constructed, enlarged, altered or put in operation until plans for the same have been approved and a permit issued by the State Commissioner of Health and a copy of the plans, as approved, filed with the board of water commissioners of the village of Catskill.
