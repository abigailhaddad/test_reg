(d) Failure to cure. At the conclusion of the period for implementation of an\napproved CAP, the office or its designee may request information from the\ncovered provider to determine whether the CAP has been fully and properly\nimplemented. If it has been so implemented, the matter shall be considered\nclosed and no further action on the part of the office or the provider shall be\nrequired. If the office or its designee determines that the CAP has not been\nfully and properly implemented within the designated corrective action period, the office or its designee shall provide written notice to the provider and may\ntake one or more of the following actions, taking into account the seriousness\nof the violations, the nature of the provider's services, and the provider's\nefforts to correct the violations, if any: (1)\n\nAt its sole discretion, modify the CAP and/or extend the time for the provider\nto complete implementation. (2)\n\nIssue a final determination of non-compliance, together with a notice of the\nsanctions which the office seeks to impose. Such sanctions may include: (i) redirection of State funds or\n\nState-authorized payments to be used to provide program services, where\npossible and consistent with Federal and State laws; (ii)\nsuspension, modification, limitation, or\nrevocation of the provider's license(s) to operate program(s) for the delivery\nof program services; (iii)\nsuspension, modification or termination of contracts or other agreements with\nthe covered provider; and\n(iv)\nany\nother lawful actions or penalties deemed appropriate by the office or its\ndesignee. (e) Opportunity for appeal.

The request must include a\ndetailed explanation of the legal and factual bases for the provider's\nchallenge to the determination and all documentation in support of the\nprovider's position. If a request for an administrative appeal is not made\nwithin the required 30 calendar days, the determination of noncompliance shall\nbecome final and the proposed sanction shall be imposed. Unless the office or\nits designee seeks to impose a sanction for which an administrative hearing is\notherwise required by statute or regulation, the covered provider's appeal\nshall be limited to an administrative review of the record. Following the\nreview, the covered provider shall be provided with a final written\ndetermination setting forth the findings of fact and conclusions of law that\nsupport the determination.
