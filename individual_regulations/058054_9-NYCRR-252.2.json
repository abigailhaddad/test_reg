  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 252.2 - State agency responsibilities: purpose, scope and applicabilty\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe purpose of this section is to establish standards, criteria, and procedures by which State agencies set annual goals for direct\nand indirect contracting opportunities with certified service-disabled\nveteran-owned business enterprises, and the processes by which these master\ngoal plans are submitted, including what information needs to be reported, and\nprocedures and consequences for State agencies that fail to meet their goals\nwithout a good faith effort to maximize contractual opportunities for certified\nenterprises. (a) Annual State\nagency-specific goals. (1)\n\nEach\n\nState agency shall develop and adopt agency-specific goals in accordance with\narticle 3 of the Veterans' Services Law. Such agency specific goals shall be in\naddition to goals established pursuant to article 15-A of the Executive Law\nwith respect to procurements from certified minority owned and women owned\nbusiness enterprises. (2)\n\nAgency-specific goals shall be reflected in the State agency's master goal plan\nand any subsequent updates to the master goal plan for the inclusion of\ncertified service-disabled veteran-owned business enterprises with\njustifications for such goals. (3)\n\nAgency-specific goals shall be set upon a review of the scope, character and\nrelevant expenditures associated with the State contracts that are expected to\nbe let or performed during the relevant fiscal year and shall be based on\nspecific factors concerning said State contracts, which shall include, where\napplicable, the following: (i) statewide\navailability of service-disabled veteran-owned business enterprises for\nconstruction, construction services, non-construction services, technology, commodities or products; (ii)\nthe\navailability of certified service-disabled veteran-owned business enterprises\nfor the State agency's State contracts found in the Directory of\n\nService-Disabled Veteran-Owned Businesses maintained by the Office of General\n\nServices; (iii)\nthe geographic\nlocation(s) of the performance of the State agency's contracts; (iv)\nthe extent to which geography is\nmaterial to the performance of the State contract and the ability of certified\nservice-disabled veteran-owned business enterprises that are located outside of\nthe geographic location(s) to perform on State contracts notwithstanding their\nlocation; and\n(v) such other\nfactors as the State agency can specifically delineate and justify with\nsupporting facts and documentation. (4)\n\nAgency-specific goals shall be\nestablished on a State fiscal year basis or, where the State agency operates on\na different fiscal year and upon the approval of the director, the State\nagency's fiscal year. (b) Master goal plan. (1)\n\nEach State agency is responsible for and\nrequired to have a master goal plan on file with DSDVBD. (2)\n\nIn the event a State agency is deficient\nwith regard to the requirement set forth in this subdivision, the subject State\nagency shall take affirmative measures to submit a master goal plan to DSDVBD\nwithin 30 days of receipt of a written notice of such a deficiency. (3)\n\nSuch master goal plan shall include the\nfollowing: (i) agency-specific goals set\npursuant to this section for service-disabled veteran-owned business\nenterprises; (ii)\nagency-specific\ngoals expressed as a percentage of aggregate agency expenditures, specifically\nincluding each of the following contracting categories, or in limited\ncircumstances due to administrative necessity, other such categories\nestablished by the director: (a) construction; (b) construction\nrelated services; (c) non-construction related services; (d) technology; and\n(e) commodities; (iii)\na description of any practices, procedures, strategies or actions, in addition to those referenced in these\nregulations, that may be implemented by the agency to ensure participation by\ncertified service-disabled veteran-owned business enterprises in State\ncontracts; (iv)\na list of personnel\nresponsible for the implementation of article 3 of the Veterans' Services\n\nLaw; (v) any other applicable\nappropriation and expenditure which may not be subject to goals, but that the\n\nState agency deems relevant or necessary to the promotion and participation of\nservice-disabled veteran-owned business enterprises in state procurement; and\n(vi)\nsuch other information\nthat a State agency deems relevant or necessary to its master goal\nplan. (5)\n\nThe master\ngoal plan shall be the basis for each State agency's prospective efforts, practices and procedures to reasonably achieve the participation of\nservice-disabled veteran-owned business enterprises in the State agency's\nprocurement. (c) State agency master goal plan submission procedures. (1)\n\nAll State agencies subject to article 3\nof the Veterans' Services Law shall submit and/or have an active master goal\nplan in force and on file with DSDVBD.

(3)\n\nIn instances where a State agency has a\nmaster goal plan on file with DSDVBD and such State agency is in good standing\nwith DSDVBD regarding its good faith efforts to meet its agency-specific goals\nas outlined therein, the director may, at his or her discretion, permit a State\nagency to submit an update to the master goal plan in lieu of a submission of a\nnew master goal plan. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a new master goal plan\nmust be submitted to the division by each State agency a minimum of once every\nfive years. (d) State agency master goal plan review. (1)\n\nThe director shall review the agency\nmaster goal plan to determine: (i) whether\nthe goals within the plan are reasonable and reflective of a process that has\nemployed an assessment of the agency's total procurement portfolio as it\nrelates to the participation of service-disabled veteran-owned business\nenterprises in agency contracts; (ii)\nwhether the factual basis and supporting\ndocumentation for such goals comport with the requirements set forth in this\nsection; (iii)\nwhether the goals\nset by the State agency adequately reflect the availability of certified\nservice-disabled veteran-owned business enterprises for the agency's contracts; and\n(iv)\nwhether other factors\nraised in the master goal plan have a legitimate substantive impact on the\ngoals set by the State agency. (2)\n\nFollowing the submission of a master goal\nplan by a State agency and review of such a master goal plan by the director, the director shall provide written notice of the acceptance or rejection of the\nmaster goal plan and if the plan is rejected, the agency shall revise and\nresubmit its plan which shall address any input provided by the\ndirector. (3)\nA State agency shall\nresubmit its master goal plan within 30 days of receipt of a notice of\nrejection incorporating revisions and recommended modifications or stating any\nreasons why modifications recommended by the director cannot be incorporated in\nthe State agency's master goal plan.

Such State agency may\nconfer with the director to discuss performance improvements in its\nprocurements from service-disabled veteran-owned businesses so that the agency\ncan overcome any ongoing difficulties and take positive actions to move forward\nwith compliance with its master goal plan. (h) Establishing contract goals and\nidentifying subcontract opportunities for certified businesses. (1)\n\nWhere practical, feasible and\nappropriate, State agencies shall seek to achieve a six percent goal on all\n\nState contracts for service-disabled veteran-owned business enterprises.
