  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.13 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The rules and\nregulations of this Part are considered adequate for safety under conditions\nnormally encountered in the gas industry. However, these rules and regulations\ncannot specifically provide for all abnormal or unusual conditions; nor can\nthey specifically detail all methods for achieving compliance. Approved\nalternate methods may be used provided that all work performed within the scope\nof this Part shall meet or exceed the safety standards expressed or implied\nherein. (b) In complying with this\n\nPart, operators shall use methods that are reasonable and proper for the\nanticipated operating conditions and that can reasonably be expected to provide\na level of safety equivalent to or greater than that which would result from\nfollowing the generally accepted standards of the gas industry. The Gas Piping\n\nTechnology Committee Guide (GPTC) for Gas Transmission and Distribution Piping\n\nSystem is, except where in conflict with provisions of this Part, representative of this level of practice. (c) Waiver. If a waiver of or deviation from\nthe application of any rules prescribed in this Part is indicated because of\nspecial facts, application may be made to the Public Service Commission for\nwaiver of or deviation from the rules and regulations in this Part. Each\nrequest shall include a full and comprehensive justification for such requested\nwaiver or deviation, together with a proposed alternate rule to be considered\nfor application to the conditions requiring the waiver or deviation. (d) This Part is concerned with the safety of\nthe general public and employee safety to the extent that it is affected by\nbasic design, quality of the materials and workmanship, requirements for\ntesting, and maintenance of gas transmission and distribution facilities. Existing industrial safety regulations pertaining to work area, safety devices, and safe work practices are not intended to be supplanted by this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.13\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
