  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 613-4.3 - Inspections and leak detection\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General inspection and leak\ndetection requirements. (1)\nA\nmethod, or combination of methods, of inspection and leak detection must be\nprovided, that: (i) can assess the\nintegrity/remaining useful life of, and detect a leak from any portion of the\ntank and the piping that are in contact with the ground and routinely contain\npetroleum; (ii)\nis performed in\naccordance with an acceptable code of practice, or installed and calibrated in\naccordance with the manufacturer's instructions; and\n(iii)\nmeets the requirements of subdivisions\n(c) and (d) of this section, as applicable. In addition, the methods listed\nunder paragraphs (c)(1), and (d)(1), (2), and (3) of this section must be\ncapable of detecting the leak rate or quantity specified for that method with a\nprobability of detection of 95 percent and a probability of false alarm of 5\npercent. (2)\n\nIf an\ninspection or method of leak detection that complies with the requirements of\nthis section cannot be implemented, the AST system must be permanently closed\nin accordance with subdivision 4.5(b) of this Subpart. (3)\n\nIf the petroleum stored will change such\nthat the AST system would then be subject to new inspections and tests required\nunder this section, these inspections and tests must be performed before the\nchange occurs. (b) Specific inspection and leak detection requirements for tanks and\npiping. (1)\n\nTank inspection\nand leak detection. Tanks must be monitored for leaks as follows: (i) Category 1 tanks.

(b) No inspections or leak\ndetection is required for Category 1 tanks that are: (1)\nentirely aboveground\n(\ne.g., a tank on a rack, cradle or stilts); or\n(2)\npart of AST systems storing No. 5 or No. 6 fuel oil. (c) If any\nportion of the AST system is not inspected as required, that AST system must be\npromptly taken out of service in accordance with subdivision 4.5(a) of this\n\nSubpart. (ii)\n\nCategory 2 tanks. Reserved. (iii)\n\nCategory 3 tanks. Reserved. (2)\n\nPiping leak detection. Except for piping described under\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, piping that is in contact with the ground\nand routinely contains petroleum must be monitored for leaks as follows: (i) Pressurized piping. (a) Category 1 piping. (1)\n\nCategory 1 piping that conveys petroleum\nunder pressure must be equipped with an automatic line leak detector that is\noperated in accordance with paragraph(d)(1) of this section or, at least every\nten years, have a line tightness test performed in accordance with paragraph\n(d)(2) of this section. (2)\n\nNo leak\ndetection is required for Category 1 piping that conveys petroleum under\npressure and is part of AST systems storing No. 5 or No. 6 fuel oil. (b) Category 2\npiping. Category 2 piping that conveys petroleum under pressure and is\npart of AST systems storing motor fuel, must be equipped with an automatic line\nleak detector that is operated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this\nsection. (c) Category 3\npiping. Category 3 piping that conveys petroleum under pressure and is\npart of AST systems storing motor fuel, must be equipped with an automatic line\nleak detector that is operated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nSuction and gravity-fed piping. (a) Category 1 piping. (1)\n\nCategory 1 piping that conveys petroleum\nunder suction or hydrostatic pressure must, at least every ten years, have a\nline tightness test performed in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nNo leak detection is\nrequired for Category 1 piping that conveys petroleum under suction or\nhydrostatic pressure and is part of AST systems storing No. 5 or No. 6 fuel\noil. (b) Category 2 piping. Reserved. (c) Category 3 piping. Reserved. (iii)\n\nAlternative piping leak detection. Piping that is associated\nwith a field-constructed tank with a design capacity greater than 50,000\ngallons, must be monitored for leaks using one of the methods required under\nparagraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, as applicable, or have a bulk\npiping tightness test performed in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this\nsection. (c) Tank inspection and testing methods. Tank inspections and\ntightness testing used to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) must be\nconducted in accordance with the following: (1)\n\nTank tightness testing. (i) Tank tightness testing (or another test\nof equivalent performance) must be capable of detecting a leak at the rate of\n0.1 gallon per hour from any portion of the tank that routinely contains\npetroleum while accounting for the effects of thermal expansion or contraction\nof the petroleum, vapor pockets, tank deformation, evaporation or condensation, and the location of the water table.
