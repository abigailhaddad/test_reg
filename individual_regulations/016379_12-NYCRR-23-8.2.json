  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-8.2 - Special provisions for mobile cranes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Inspection. (1)\nA mobile crane\nwhich is moved from one job site to another without dismantling beyond the\nfolding of the boom and such additional dismantling as may be necessary for\nthat purpose is not required to be inspected before being first erected or\noperated on each job site to which it is moved, providing the monthly\ninspections are performed on schedule. (2)\n\nThe inspection and repair of mobile crane\nbooms shall be made only when such booms are lowered and adequately\nsupported. (b) Footings and outriggers. (1)\n\nFootings. A firm footing shall be provided for every mobile crane. Where such firm footing is not naturally available, it shall be provided by\nsubstantial timbers, cribbing or other structural members sufficient to\ndistribute the load so as not to exceed the safe bearing capacity of the\nunderlying material. (2)\n\nOutriggers. (i) Means shall be provided to\nhold all outriggers of mobile cranes in their retracted positions while such\ncranes are traveling and in their extended positions when blocked for\nhoisting. (ii)\n\nWhere used on mobile\ncranes, power-operated jacks shall be provided with means to prevent loss of\njack support under load. (iii)\n\nEach\noutrigger on a mobile crane shall be visible from its actuating\nlocation. (iv)\n\nMeans shall be\nprovided to securely fasten outrigger floats to the outriggers when in\nuse. (c) Hoisting the load. (1)\n\nBefore\nhoisting a load the person directing the lift shall see that the mobile crane\nis level and, where necessary, blocked. (2)\n\nBefore hoisting any load at a new job\nsite, the boom of a mobile crane shall be test operated to its maximum\nheight. (3)\n\nLoads lifted by mobile\ncranes shall be raised vertically so as to avoid swinging during hoisting\nexcept when such operations are permitted by the capacity chart. A tag or\nrestraint line shall be used when rotation or swinging of any load being\nhoisted by a mobile crane may create a hazard. (4)\n\nWhen a mobile crane is operated at a\nfixed radius, the boom-hoist pawl or other positive locking device shall be\nengaged. (d) Mobile\ncrane travel. (1)\nA mobile crane\ntraveling to or from one job site to another or traveling on a street or\nhighway shall not carry any jibs, attachments, buckets or other devices or\nmaterial attached in any way to the boom whether the boom is in the folded\nposition or not. Exception: A hydraulic crane where the jib is permanently hinged to\nthe boom or any crane where the manufacturer authorizes that the design of such\ncrane guarantees the safe transport of the jib or other attachments. (2)\n\nMobile cranes shall not travel\nwith suspended loads unless such crane is under the control of a competent, designated person who shall be responsible for the position of the load, boom\nlocation, ground support, travel route and speed of movement. (3)\nA mobile crane, with or without load, shall not travel with the boom so high that it may bounce back over the\ncab. (e) Counterweights for mobile cranes. Counterweights shall be provided for and used on mobile\ncranes as specified by the manufacturers or builders of such cranes or by\nprofessional engineers licensed to practice in the State of New York. A mobile\ncrane shall not be operated without the full amount of ballast or counterweight\nin place. Mobile cranes that do not have the ballast or counterweight attached\nmay be operated temporarily with special care when handling light loads. The\nballast or counterweight in place on any mobile crane shall not exceed the\nmanufacturer's or builder's specifications. (f) Mobile crane construction. (1)\n\nBooms. (i) Booms, boom sections and jibs of every\nmobile crane shall be constructed of suitable steel and shall be used only for\nthe purposes recommended by the manufacturer or builder of such mobile\ncrane. (ii)\n\nThe boom of any mobile\ncrane shall not be raised from the level of the surface on which the crane\nrests other than by the use of its own hoisting capabilities. The design, construction and length of any boom shall be such that there is no undue stress\nimposed on the crane structure or mechanism during such raising\noperations. (iii)\n\nBoom stops shall\nbe provided on mobile cranes to prevent overtopping. (iv)\n\nAny boom extension used on a mobile\ncrane which is not provided by the manufacturer or builder of the crane shall\nbe designed by a professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of New\n\nYork. A copy of the design plans for such boom extension shall be kept at the\njob site available for examination by the commissioner. (2)\n\nBraking mechanism. In addition to the\nhoisting mechanism brakes required by this Subpart, every mobile crane shall be\nprovided with the following: (i) An adequate\nbraking mechanism for the boom hoist. (ii)\nA swing lock or swing brake capable of\npreventing rotation. (iii)\nA brake\nor other equivalent device adequate to bring the mobile crane to a stop from\nany travel for which such crane is designed, together with a means of locking\nsuch mobile crane so as to hold it stationary. (3)\n\nBoom sheave guard. The sheave at the end of a mobile crane boom on which the\nhoisting rope operates shall be provided with a guard to prevent the rope from\nleaving the sheave in case of rope slack or any other condition. (g) Mobile crane\ncapacity charts. (1)\n\nLoad ratings for\nmobile cranes. (i) Load ratings shall not\nexceed the percentages listed in Table XVII of this Subpart of the tipping\nloads for mobile cranes. (ii)\n\nThe\nstability of mobile cranes will be influenced by such factors as freely\nsuspended loads, track, wind or ground conditions, condition and inflation of\ntires, boom lengths and proper operating speeds for existing conditions. All\nsuch factors shall be taken into account in determining mobile crane stability. TABLE XVII MAXIMUM LOAD RATINGS FOR MOBILE\nCRANES\nType of mobile crane\nmounting\n\nMaximum load ratings (Percentages of\ntipping loads)\n\nCrawler without outriggers....... 75\n\nCrawler, outriggers fully extended....... 85\n\nTruck and wheel mounted (with or without\noutriggers fully extended)....... 85\n(2)\n\nMobile crane capacity chart required. (i) Every mobile crane shall be provided with\na capacity chart which shall be posted and maintained clearly legible in the\ncab of the crane visible to the crane operator from his operating position. Such chart shall set forth the safe loads which may be hoisted by such crane at\nvarious lengths of boom at various boom angles and radial distances. Where\noutriggers are provided, such safe loads shall be set forth on the capacity\nchart with and without the use of the outriggers. Such chart shall also\nindicate whether or not such handling accessories as hooks, blocks and slings\nare included. (ii)\n\nUnless furnished\nby the manufacturer or builder of the mobile crane, the required capacity chart\nshall be prepared and certified by a professional engineer licensed to practice\nin the State of New York and a copy thereof submitted, on request, to the\ncommissioner. (iii)\n\nNo load shall\nbe lifted by any mobile crane that exceeds the relevant maximum specified by\nits capacity chart. (h) Boom angle indicator. Every mobile crane having either a boom exceeding 40 feet\nin length or a maximum rated capacity exceeding 15 tons shall be provided with\nan approved boom angle indicator. Such boom angle indicator shall indicate the\nboom angle in degrees and shall be clearly visible to the mobile crane operator\nfrom his operating position at all times. Such boom angle indicator shall emit\na visible or audible warning signal whenever the boom angle is unsafe. Exception: Boom angle indicators are not required to be operative\nwhen such mobile cranes are used for excavation work with clamshells or\ndragline buckets. (i) Unauthorized operation. The operator's cab of every mobile crane shall be kept\nlocked whenever the operator is not present. No unauthorized person shall enter\nthe cab of or remain immediately adjacent to any mobile crane in operation. Ignition locks, locking bars or other equivalent devices shall be provided to\nprevent unauthorized operation of mobile cranes. (j) Operation of a mobile crane with a\ndemolition ball. In addition to the general requirements of this Part\n(rule) for mechanical demolition, the operation of a mobile crane with a\ndemolition ball shall be subject to the following provisions: (1)\n\nThe weight of any demolition ball shall\nnot exceed 50 percent of the safe load capacity of the boom length used at its\nlowest angle of operation. (2)\n\nDuring operation with a demolition ball the swing of the boom shall not exceed\n30 degrees from the center line, front to back, of the crane\nmounting. (3)\n\nThe windows of such\ncrane cabs shall be constructed of shatterproof glass or shall be protected by\nadequate metal screens. (4)\n\nThe\nload line and the attachment of the demolition ball to the load line shall be\ninspected at least twice daily. (5)\n\nTruck-mounted mobile cranes without outriggers shall not be used with a\ndemolition ball. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
