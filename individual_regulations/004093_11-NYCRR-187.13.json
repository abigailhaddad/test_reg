(b) The foregoing criteria apply regardless of whether premiums are due the insurer on the single premium advance system or on the monthly outstanding balance system. Nothing herein shall prevent the insurer from making deposits in a financial institution which are related to a credit insurance program in an amount of up to three months' expected claims for purposes of drawing drafts for claim payments, provided such procedure is available to all creditors of a given minimum size. Nothing herein shall prevent the insurer from making deposits in a financial institution which are not related to a credit insurance program and which are reasonably necessary for use in the ordinary course of business of the insurer.
