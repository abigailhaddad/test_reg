  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1644-2.2 - Computation of interest on temporary (short-term) indebtedness\n\nState Regulations\n\nInterest on local agency temporary indebtedness, whether to the State, as evidenced by certificates of indebtedness, or to\nprivate investors, as evidenced by temporary loan notes, is computed on the\nbasis of a 360-day year, with each month considered as having 30 days. The date\nof issue, or effective date of issue, of the evidence of indebtedness is\nincluded, but not the date of maturity. The computation of interest on\ntemporary indebtedness is illustrated in the following example, where it is\nassumed that a temporary loan note for $100,000 is dated January 28, 1947, matures on April 15, 1947 and bears an interest rate of 80 per cent per annum. The computation would be equally valid where the local agency had issued its\ncertificate of indebtedness for an advance by the State representing the\nproceeds of an issue of short-term notes by the State. (a) Step 1. Using the above conventions, determine the life of the\nnote, in days, as follows: Month\n\nNo. of days\n\nJanuary (1/28, 1/29 and 1/30)\n3\n\nFebruary\n30\n\nMarch\n30\n\nApril\n14\n\nTotal\n77\n\nNote that, in arriving at the number of days, January\n31 has not been counted and that each full calendar month between the issue and\nmaturity dates is counted as 30 days, regardless of the actual number of days\nin the respective months. This results from the application of the convention\nfor the 30-day month. Special cases may arise where the date of issue or\nmaturity is the 31st day of a month. These are handled by counting the 31st day\nas one day, if the issue date is the 31st day of the month, and by counting the\nmonth as 30 days, if the maturity date is the 31st day of the month. (b) Step 2. Determine the daily rate of interest, in dollars, by\nmultiplying the principal amount of the note by the interest rate and dividing\nthe product by 360 days: $100,000 *\n80%\n/\n360\n=\n$2.222222\n\nThe quotient is carried out to six decimal places, and\nreduced to five decimal places. If the sixth decimal is four or less, it is\ndropped and the fifth decimal retained unchanged, but if the sixth decimal is\nfive or more, the fifth decimal is increased by one when the sixth decimal is\ndropped. (c) Step\n3. Determine the amount of interest to be accrued at the\nend of each quarter in accordance with the illustration which follows: Month\n\nNo. of days\n\nDaily interest\nrate\n\nInterest to be\naccrued\n\nJanuary (1/28, 1/29, 1/30)\n3\n2.22222\n$ 6.67\n\nFebruary\n30\n2.22222\n66.67\n\nMarch\n30\n2.22222\n66.67\n\nTotals\n63\n$140.01\n\nWhen a full quarter is involved, the quarterly accrual\nis obtained by multiplying the monthly interest ($66.67) by the number of\nmonths (three) or $200. The total interest accrued can be checked by\nmultiplying the aggregate life of the note, in days, by the daily interest rate\nand adjusting the interest for the final month for any possible difference, which should, at most, be not more than a few cents.
