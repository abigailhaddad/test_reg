Within 180 days of the issuance of this\n\nOrder, every executive agency shall develop and begin implementation of a plan\nto eliminate the expenditure of State funds for the purchase of bottled water\nfor use at executive agency facilities. The goal of the plan shall be to\neliminate such expenditure by May 1, 2010. Each agency shall provide a copy of\nits plan to the Commissioner of General Services (\"Commissioner\"). 2.

The plan may provide for the reasonable\nuse of bottled water in the following circumstances: (a) when no other alternative is available or\npracticable; (b) when necessary to\naddress health requirements and emergencies; and\n(c) when compliance with this Order would\nconflict with contract requirements in existence as of the effective date of\nthis Order. 4. If an\nexecutive agency believes it will be unable to comply with the time frames set\nforth in this Order, it may obtain an extension upon the approval of the\n\nDirector of State Operations, for good cause shown, and only to the extent\nnecessary to address the justification supporting the extension. A request for\nan extension shall be made in writing by the executive agency head or his or\nher designee to the Director of State Operations with a copy to the\n\nCommissioner. 5.
