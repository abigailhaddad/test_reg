  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1801.1 - Public access to records\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Purpose. The commission, as an independent compact agency, is not\nsubject to any of its member jurisdictions' laws regarding public access to\nrecords. Nevertheless, the commission wishes to assure, to the maximum extent\npracticable, the availability of commission records consistent with the\n\nSusquehanna River Basin Compact. The commission shall maintain an access to\nrecords policy that outlines the details and procedures related to public\naccess to the commission's records. Any revisions to this policy shall be\nconsistent with this section and undertaken in accordance with appropriate\npublic notice and comment consistent with requirements of\n18 CFR\n808.1(b). (b) Scope. This section shall apply to all recorded information, regardless of whether the information exists in written or electronic format. There is a strong presumption that records shall be public, except where\nconsiderations of privacy, confidentiality, and security must be considered and\nrequire thoughtful balancing. The commission shall identify types of records\nthat are not subject to public access: (1)\npersonnel or employment records, excluding salary information; (2)\ntrade secrets, copyrighted material, or any other confidential business\ninformation; (3)\nrecords exempted\nfrom disclosure by statute, regulation, court order, or recognized\nprivilege; (4)\nrecords reflecting\ninternal pre-decisional deliberations, including deliberations between the\ncommission and representatives of member jurisdictions; (5)\nrecords reflecting employee medical\ninformation, evaluations, tests or other identifiable health\ninformation; (6)\nrecords reflecting\nemployee personal information, such as social security number, driver's license\nnumber, personal financial information, home addresses, home or personal\ncellular numbers, confidential personal information, spouse names, marital\nstatus or dependent information; (7)\ninvestigatory or enforcement records that\nwould interfere with active enforcement proceedings or individual due process\nrights, disclose the identity of public complainants or confidential sources or\ninvestigative techniques or endanger the life or safety of commission\npersonnel; or\n(8)\nrecords related\nto critical infrastructure, excluding financial records, emergency procedures, or facilities. (c) Procedures. The access to records policy will detail the necessary\nprocedures for requesting records and processing records requests: (1)\nrequests shall be in writing and shall be\nreasonably specific; (2)\nthe\ncommission shall identify an access to records officer to handle\nrequests; (3)\nthe commission shall\nrespond to a records request within a reasonable time and in consideration of\navailable resources and the nature of the request; (4)\nthe commission shall not be required to\ncreate a record that does not already exist, or to compile, maintain, format or\norganize a public record in a manner in which the commission does not currently\npractice; (5)\na procedure shall be\nidentified for electronic transfer, copying or otherwise providing records in a\nmanner that maintains the integrity of the commission's files; and\n(6)\na procedure shall be identified for\nhandling review of requests that seek access to information that has been\nidentified as confidential and for notifying the person(s) who submitted the\nconfidential information that it is subject to a records\nrequest. (d) Fees. The commission shall adopt and maintain a records processing\nfee schedule. The fees shall be calculated to reflect the actual costs to the\ncommission for processing records requests and may include the costs of\nreproducing records and the cost to search, prepare and/or redact records for\nextraordinary requests. (e) Appeals. Any person aggrieved by a commission action on a records\nrequest shall have 30 days to appeal a decision in accordance with\n18 CFR\n808.2. (f) Disclosure to consultants, advisory\ncommittees, and State and local government officials and employees. Data and information otherwise exempt from public disclosure\nmay be disclosed to commission consultants, advisory committees, and State and\nlocal government officials and employees for use only in their work in\ncooperation with the commission. Such persons are thereafter subject to the\nsame restrictions with respect to the disclosure of such data and information\nas any other commission employee. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
