  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-2.5 - Use of dollar amounts in computing tax\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 171(19))\n(a) Any amount required to be included in a\nreport may be entered at the nearest whole dollar amount. This does not apply\nto the items that must be taken into account in making the computations\nnecessary to determine such amount. For example, each sale must be taken into\naccount at its exact amount, including cents, in computing the amount to be\nincluded in the franchise tax report. However, the total amount to be included\nin the franchise tax report may be entered at the nearest whole dollar amount. A taxpayer may elect not to use whole dollar amounts by reporting all amounts\nin full, including cents. (b) For\nthe purpose of the computation to the nearest dollar, a fractional part of a\ndollar shall be disregarded unless it amounts to one-half dollar or more, in\nwhich case the amount (determined without regard to the fractional part of a\ndollar) shall be increased by one dollar. (1)\n\nExample. Exact amount\n\nTo be reported as\n$500,000.49\n$500,000.00\n$500,000.50\n$500,001.00\n$500,000.51\n$500,001.00\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n3-2.5\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
