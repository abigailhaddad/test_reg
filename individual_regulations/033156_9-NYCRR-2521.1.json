If an owner combines a rent regulated accommodation with an\napartment not subject to rent regulation, the resulting apartment shall be\nsubject to the rent stabilization law. If an owner increases the area of an\napartment not subject to the rent stabilization law by adding space that was\npreviously part of a rent regulated apartment, each apartment shall be subject\nto the rent stabilization law. (2)\n\nWhere an owner substantially increases the outer dimension of a vacant housing\naccommodation, such initial rent shall be the prior rent of such housing\naccommodation, increased by a percentage that is equal to the percentage\nincrease in the dwelling space and such other increases authorized by this\n\nTitle including any applicable guideline increase and individual apartment\nimprovement increase that could be authorized for the unit prior to the\nalteration of the outer dimensions. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the above\nincreases may be denied based on the occurrence of such vacancy due to\nharassment, fraud, or other acts of evasion which may require that such rent be\nset in accordance with Part 2526 of this Title. (4)\n\nWhere the vacant housing accommodations\nare combined, modified, divided or the dimension of such housing accommodation\notherwise altered and these changes are being made pursuant to a preservation\nregulatory agreement with a federal, state or local governmental agency or\ninstrumentality, the legal regulated rents charged thereafter shall be based on\nan initial rent set by such agency or instrumentality. (5)\n\nWhere an owner substantially decreases\nthe outer dimensions of a vacant housing accommodation, such initial rent shall\nbe the prior rent of such housing accommodation, decreased by the same\npercentage the square footage of the original apartment was decreased by and\nsuch other increases authorized by this Title including any applicable\nguideline increase and individual apartment improvement increases that could be\nauthorized for the apartment prior to the alteration of the outer\ndimensions. (6)\n\nApartment\ncombinations and individual apartment improvements: (i) When an owner combines two or more rent\nregulated apartments, the owner may use each of the previous apartments'\nremaining individual apartment improvement allowances for the purposes of a\ntemporary individual apartment improvement rent increase. The owner shall\nsubsequently designate a surviving apartment for the purposes of registration\nthat has the same apartment number as one of the prior apartments. If that\nprior apartment has any reimbursable individual apartment improvement money\nremaining after the combination, that money may be reimbursed for future\nindividual apartment improvements undertaken within the subsequent fifteen\nyears following the combination. (ii)\n\nIn order for an owner to qualify for a\ntemporary individual apartment improvement rent increase when apartments are\ncombined, the requirements for an individual apartment improvement, including\nall notification requirements under Section\n2522.4\n(a) of this\n\nTitle must be met. (7)\n\nOwners shall maintain the records and rent histories of all combined\napartments, both prior to and post combination, for the purposes of rent\nsetting, overcharge and all other proceedings to which the records are\napplicable.
