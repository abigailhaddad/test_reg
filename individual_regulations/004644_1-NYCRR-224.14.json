(a) The owner or operator of a retail establishment selling petroleum products from underground storage tanks (USTs) shall permanently mark all fill ports to identify the products inside. These markings shall be in accordance with the color code set forth in API RP 1637, 3rd edition, July 2006, published by the American Petroleum Institute, 1220 L Street, Washington DC 20005-4070; a copy of this document is maintained in a file at the Department of Agriculture and Markets, 10B Airline Drive, Albany, New York 12235, and at the Department of State, 99 Washington Avenue, Suite 650, Albany, New York 12231, and is available for public inspection during regular business hours. If a UST system contains petroleum that does not have a corresponding API color code, the owner or operator of the retail establishment must clearly and conspicuously mark the fill port to identify the petroleum that is in the UST system. For any fill port connected to multiple UST systems storing different types of petroleum, the owner or operator of the retail establishment may place the marking referred to herein near the fill port to identify the petroleum in the UST systems.
