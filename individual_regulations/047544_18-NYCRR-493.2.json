  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 493.2 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To revoke, suspend, limit, or modify an operating certificate, or to assess a civil\npenalty against an operator for failing to operate in compliance with the\n\nSocial Services Law or this Title, or for operating a facility without a valid\noperating certificate, the department must hold a hearing in accordance with\nthe procedures established in this Part, except as stated in subdivision (b) of\nthis section. (b) The department\nmay temporarily suspend or limit an operating certificate without a hearing for\n60 days or less if the department finds that the public health, or an\nindividual's health, safety or welfare, is in imminent danger. If the\ndepartment schedules an expedited hearing to begin during the suspension\nperiod, in a proceeding to suspend, revoke or limit the operating certificate, as set forth in section\n493.8\nof this Part, the temporary\nsuspension will remain in effect until a decision is issued. The department\nalso may issue an order to the operator to correct immediately a condition\nwhich constitutes a danger to the physical or mental health of the facility's\nresidents. Such an order will remain in effect unless reversed by a decision\nissued after a hearing held under this Part. (c) Upon the denial of an application for, or\nrenewal of, an operating certificate, the operator has the right to a hearing\nto challenge the denial. The department must notify the operator of the denial\nby certified mail, return receipt requested, and must include in the notice of\ndenial the grounds upon which the denial is based, and a statement that the\noperator may request a hearing to review the denial by mailing a request for a\nhearing to the department's office of administrative hearings, bureau of\nspecial hearings, post-marked within 60 days of the operator's receipt of the\ndepartment's notification of denial. The notice of denial also must advise the\noperator that failure to request a hearing in the manner provided in this\nsubdivision within this 60-day period will preclude the operator from\nchallenging the department's determination at a hearing. (d) The parties may enter into a stipulation\nto settle any action described in subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of this section\nand this stipulation may include the requirement that the operator pay a civil\npenalty. (e) When an operating\ncertificate expires during the course of a hearing to revoke, suspend or limit\nthe operating certificate, the department may temporarily extend the operating\ncertificate until the hearing decision is issued. (f) When an operator requests a hearing to\nreview the denial of an application to renew an operating certificate, the\noperating certificate remains in effect until either the hearing decision is\nissued, the operator withdraws the hearing request or the operator fails to\nappear at the hearing.
