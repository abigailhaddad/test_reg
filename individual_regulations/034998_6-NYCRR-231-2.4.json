  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-2.4 - Permit requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nAny proposed source project or proposed major facility\nwhich emits any nonattainment contaminant and is subject to this Subpart\naccording to any applicability criterion contained in section\n231-2.2\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart must comply with the following permit requirements: (a) 'Application requirements'. (1)\n\nProposed source project netting out of\napplicability. The applicant shall, as part of a permit application for any\nsignificant source project that does not result in a significant net emission\nincrease, identify each emission unit from which an ERC was used in a net\nemission increase determination of non-applicability in accordance with the\nrequirements of section\n231-2.7\nof this Subpart. This shall\ninclude the name of the emission unit, emission unit identification number, and\nthe mechanism proposed to effect the ERC ('i.e.', emission unit shutdown, source reduction, curtailment, over-control of emissions beyond an acceptable\nlimit). (2)\n\nProposed source project\nor proposed major facility subject to this Subpart. As part of a permit\napplication for a proposed source project or proposed major facility subject to\nthis Subpart, the applicant shall: (i) certify that all emission units which are part of any major facility located in\n\nNew York State and under the applicant's ownership or control (or under the\nownership or control of any entity which controls, is controlled by, or has\ncommon control with the applicant) are in compliance, or are on a schedule for\ncompliance, with all applicable emission limitations and standards under\n\nChapter III of this Title; and\n(ii)\nsubmit an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and\nenvironmental control techniques which demonstrates that benefits of the\nproposed source project or proposed major facility significantly outweigh the\nenvironmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification within New York State; and\n(iii)\nsubmit a LAER analysis in accordance\nwith section\n231-2.5\nof this Subpart for each\nnonattainment contaminant subject to this Subpart; and\n(iv)\nfor emissions of PM-10 or CO only: ('a')\nsubmit a list of the offset sources\n(facilities) from which ERCs will be used as part of the emission offsets\nrequired pursuant to section\n231-2.9\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. This list must include the name and location of the facility, DEC\nidentification number (if applicable) and the emission reduction mechanism\n('i.e.', facility shutdown, emission unit shutdown, source reduction, curtailment, over control of emissions beyond an applicable limit); and\n('b')\nsubmit an air quality\nimpact evaluation in accordance with the provisions of section\n231-2.9\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart; and\n('c')\nsubmit a revised\nair quality impact evaluation, if the list changes after the department's\n'Notice of Complete Application'. Also, a supplemental public notice and a\n30-day comment period shall be required in accordance with section\n231-2.10\n(c)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart. (b) 'Permit issuance requirements'. Prior to\nissuance of a permit for a proposed source project or proposed major facility\nsubject to this Subpart, the applicant shall: (1)\nsubmit a list of offset sources\n(facilities) from which ERCs of VOC or NO\nx\nwill be used\nas part of an internal offset or a required emission offset. This list must\ninclude the name and location of the facility, DEC identification number (if\napplicable), and the emission reduction mechanism ('i.e.', facility shutdown, emission unit shutdown, source reduction, curtailment, over-control of\nemissions beyond an applicable limit). If a part or all of the list is\nsubmitted or if the list changes, after the department's 'Notice of Complete\n\nApplication', then a supplemental public notice and a 30-d ay comment period in\naccordance with section\n231-2.10\n(c)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart shall be required; (2)\nsubmit a 'Use of Emission Reduction Credits Form' (duly completed and signed by\nthe applicant and an authorized representative of the seller facility) to the\ndepartment for each offset source listed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Upon issuance of the permit for the proposed source project or proposed major\nfacility, the NYS ERC Registry will be amended to reflect that the ERCs are\ncommitted to the proposed project or facility; (3)\nsubmit a copy of each modified permit\nestablishing emission reduction credits, only for future reductions as defined\nin section\n231-2.1\nof this Subpart; and\n(4)\nfor emissions of VOC or\nNO\nx\nin an ozone nonattainment area, comply with the\ncontribution demonstration required in section\n231-2.9\n(e) of this\n\nSubpart. (c) 'Offset\nconfirmation prior to commencement of operation'. At least 60 days prior to the\ndate a proposed source project or proposed major facility commences operation, the applicant shall submit: (1)\nthe original\nERC certificate(s) to document procurement of sufficient ERCs for required\nemission offsets. The original certificate(s) must be sent to the department at\nthe address shown on the reverse side of the certificate. Copies of such\ncertificates must also be sent to the appropriate department regional\noffice; (2)\nany changes to the list\nof offset sources included in the permit issued in subdivision (b) of this\nsection. For each such change, the applicant must submit another 'Use of\n\nEmission Reduction Credits Form' signed by the applicant and an authorized\nrepresentative of the new offset source; and\n(3)\nno less than 10 working days prior to the\ndate the proposed source project or proposed major facility commences\noperation, a letter stating that the future reductions (as defined in section\n231-2.1\nof this Subpart) identified\nin the list of offset sources have physically occurred. Once the project\ncommences operation, the ERCs will be deemed to be used and the Registry will\nbe amended accordingly. (d) 'Reissuance of ERC certificates for\ncanceled or abandoned projects'. Prior to commencement of operation of a\nproposed source project or proposed major facility, if the applicant submits a\nletter informing the department of the cancellation of the proposed source\nproject or proposed major facility, the department will reissue a certificate\nto the applicant for the total tons per year of ERCs submitted to the\ndepartment as offsets. (e) 'Permit\nrevocation'. Any permit issued pursuant to this Subpart to a proposed source\nproject or proposed major facility shall be subject to revocation pursuant to\n\nPart 621 of this Title if: (1)\nconstruction\nis not commenced within 18 months from the date of issuance, excluding any\nperiod of time that the permit modification or preconstruction permit is\nsubject to challenge in State or Federal court; (2)\nconstruction is discontinued for a period\nof 18 months or more, excluding any period of time that the permit is subject\nto challenge in State or Federal court; or\n(3)\nconstruction is not completed within a\nreasonable time acceptable to the department. The department may extend the 18 month period upon a\nsatisfactory showing that an extension is justified. This provision does not\napply to the time period between construction of the approved phases of a\nphased construction project; each phase must commence construction within 18\nmonths of the projected and approved commencement date.
