  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 162.7 - Cantaloupe (muskmelon) standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. New York State Seal of Quality\ncantaloupe shall be cantaloupe (muskmelon) of one type which are mature and\nhave high internal quality and uniform appearance, but are not over-ripe or\nsoft or wilted, which are well formed, well netted, and free from decay, wet\nslip and sunscald, and free from damage caused by liquid in the seed cavity, sunburn, hail, dirt, surface mold or other disease, aphis or other insects, scars, cracks, sunken areas, ground spot, bruises, or mechanical or other\nmeans. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nHigh internal quality means that the\ncombined juice from the edible portion of a sample of cantaloupes (muskmelons)\nselected at random contains not less than 9.3 percent soluble solids as\ndetermined by an approved hand refractometer. (2)\n\nUniform in appearance means that not more\nthan one-tenth of the packages in any lot contain cantaloupes (muskmelons)\nwhich show sufficient variation in shape, size, ground color or netting to\nmaterially detract from the appearance of the contents of the individual\npackages, or which are not packed according to the approved and recognized\nmethods for the package. (3)\n\nOne\ntype means that the cantaloupes (muskmelons) in any container are similar in\ncolor of flesh and are not decidedly different in shape, character of netting\nand prominence of ribbing. (4)\n\nMature means that the muskmelon has reached the stage of maturity which will\ninsure the proper completion of normal ripening process. (5)\n\nSoft means that the muskmelon yields\nreadily to slight pressure. (6)\n\nWilted means that the muskmelon lacks turgidity and is somewhat flabby, spongy\nand pliable under moderate pressure. (7)\n\nWell formed means that the muskmelon has\nthe normal shape characteristic of the variety. (8)\n\nWell netted means that to an extent\ncharacteristic of variety the muskmelon is well covered with fully developed, well-raised netting, some portion of which is well rounded with practically no\ncrease. (9)\n\nDecay means breakdown, disintegration or fermentation of flesh or rind of the muskmelon caused by\nbacteria or fungi. (10)\n\nWet slip\nmeans a condition present at time of packing in which the stem scar is\nabnormally large, excessively wet and slippery, yields to slight pressure, and\nis frequently accompanied by fresh radial growth cracks at the edge of the stem\nscar. (11)\n\nSunscald means\ndiscolored or bleached, sunken areas of the surface having tough epidermis with\nunderlying flesh leathery and usually off color. (12)\n\nDamage means any specific defect\ndescribed in this section; or an equally objectionable variation of any one of\nthese defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects, which\nmaterially detracts from the appearance, or the edible or shipping quality of\nthe muskmelon. The following specific defects shall be considered damage: (i) when more than a slight amount of liquid\nis present in the seed cavity; (ii)\nsunburn when the color of the flesh is materially changed; when the rind is\nhard, tough, thin, or definitely flattened; when distinct flattening of the\nnetting or dark yellow surface discoloration affects an aggregate area\nexceeding 20 percent of the surface of the muskmelon, or when brown, gray, purple or dark green surface discoloration detracts from the appearance of the\nmuskmelon to a greater extent than the area of dark yellow discoloration\npermitted; (iii)\nhail when the\ninjury is unhealed or deep; (iv)\nsurface mold when the color, character, or location of the mold materially\ndetracts from the muskmelon; (v) aphis when aphis honeydew is more than slightly sticky or when resulting\ndiscoloration more than slightly detracts from the appearance of the\nmuskmelon; (vi)\nscars when healed, shallow, smooth and light colored and the aggregate area affected exceeds five\npercent of the surface of the muskmelon; or when deep rough or dark colored\ndetracting from the appearance to a greater extent than the area healed, shallow, smooth and light colored scars permitted. Smooth scarring at the\nblossom end and coalesced netting should not be considered in determining\ndamage caused by scarring unless materially detracting from the appearance of\nthe muskmelon; (vii)\ncracks when\ndeep or not dry. Slight dry cracks at the ends or the sutures of the muskmelon\nshall not be considered damage; (viii)\nground spot when the rind of the\naffected area is thin or weak, or when the size or color of the affected area\nor the character of netting on the area in relation to the remainder of the\nsurface of the muskmelon materially detracts from the appearance of the\nmuskmelon; (ix)\nbruises when the\nsurface of the muskmelon is definitely flattened or indented, or when the\nunderlying flesh is noticeably discolored; and\n(x) mechanical means when cuts or gouges are\ndeep or when any skin break is unhealed. (13)\n\nSerious damage means any specific defect\ndescribed in this section; or an equally objectionable variation of any one of\nthese defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects which seriously\ndetracts from the appearance, or the edible or shipping quality of the\nmuskmelon. The following specific defects shall be considered as serious\ndamage: (i) when a large amount of liquid is\npresent in the seed cavity or the flesh of the cavity wall is noticeably soft\nor discolored or when any fermentation is present; (ii)\nsunburn when the flesh is seriously\ndiscolored, when causing cracking of the rind, or when causing flattening of\nthe rind which seriously detracts from the appearance of the\nmuskmelon; (iii)\nhail when the\ninjury in unhealed; (iv)\nsurface\nmold when the color, character, or location of the mold seriously detracts from\nthe appearance or marketing quality of the muskmelon; (v) cracks when fresh and deep; (vi)\nbruises when the surface of the\nmuskmelon is seriously flattened or indented or when a material portion of the\nunderlying flesh is broken down; and\n(viii)\n[(vii)]\nmechanical means when fresh cuts or gouges extend into the\nedible portion of the muskmelon. (14)\n\nPermanent defects means defects which\nare not subject to change during shipping or storage, including but not limited\nto factors of shape, netting scarring, sunscald, sunburn and injury caused by\nhail or insects, and mechanical injury which is so located as to indicate that\nit occurred prior to shipment. (15)\n\nCondition defects means defects which may develop or change during shipment or\nstorage, including but not limited to decayed or soft cantaloupes (muskmelons)\nand such factors as liquid in the seed cavity, surface mold, sunken areas, fresh cracks, and bruising which is so located as to indicate that it occurred\nafter packing. (c) Tolerances. In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and\nhandling the following tolerances, by count, shall be permitted, except that\nthese tolerances shall not apply to the requirement relating to internal\nquality, and uniformity of appearance. Eight percent for cantaloupes\n(muskmelons) in any lot which fail to meet the requirements of this grade: provided, that included in this amount not more than four percent shall be\nallowed for defects causing serious damage, including in this latter amount not\nmore than one percent which are affected by decay or mold. (d) Application of tolerances. The contents\nof individual packages are subject to the following limitation: provided, that\nthe averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances specified. A package\nmay contain not more than double any specified tolerance except that at least\ntwo defective specimens may be permitted in any package. (e) Packing. Cantaloupes must be packed in\nnew standard cartons and are subject to approval by the Department of\n\nAgriculture and Markets. Package approval shall be based upon the ability of\nthe package to maintain the quality standards and integrity of the\nproduct. (f) Markings. Each package\nor display of cantaloupes (muskmelons) offered for sale under the Seal of\n\nQuality program shall have affixed the official seal designation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
