  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 446.2 - Reclassification for reporting purposes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Reclassifications are necessary to adjust\nthe financial data contained in the hospital's records to the reporting\nrequirements in this Article where they are not recorded on a functional basis. The reclassifications must be completed prior to preparing the required\nreporting forms and must be maintained as part of the hospital's books and\nrecords. (b) There are two types of\nreclassifications: (1)\nreclassifications to\nobtain the required level of reporting; and\n(2)\nreclassifications to correct accumulation\nof costs and revenues. (c) The first type of reclassification may be\nnecessary to reach the required level of reporting because the hospital has\ncombined several cost or revenue centers. For instance, a hospital may be\ncombining the costs of diagnostic radiology with therapeutic radiology. In such\ncases, it is necessary to reclassify the total direct costs by natural\nclassification of expense incurred for the two different types of services into\ntwo specific cost centers relating to these two types of services. (d) The second type of reclassification, to\ncorrect the accumulation of costs and revenues, would be necessary when the\nexpense and/or revenue associated with a particular function is recorded in a\ncost center different from the functional description specified in this Manual. For instance, a reclassification would be required if the Surgery Services\ncost/revenue center included the costs and revenues associated with the sale of\nprostheses and appliances because these costs and revenues must be reported in\nthe Medical Supplies Sold cost/revenue centers rather than the Surgery Services\ncost/revenue centers. (e) If\nexpenses and revenues related to the functions as defined by this Manual have\nnot been included in the direct costs or revenues of the indicated cost center, a reclassification is required, if significant. In no instance shall an amount\nbe considered insignificant if, in any year for any cost center, the aggregate\namount of misplaced costs or revenues is equivalent to the lesser of: (1)\nthree percent of the direct costs of the\nfunctional center transferred to or from; or\n(2)\none quarter of one percent of the total\nannual operating expenses. (f) However, in no case is a reclassification\nnecessary if the aggregate amount of misplaced cost per cost center is less\nthan $1,000. (g) These\nreclassifications may be computed on any one of the following bases: (1)\nanalysis of direct expense, including\ntime and cost studies; (2)\nratio of\ntotal charges to charges of a specific cost center; or\n(3)\nratio of total units of service to units\nof service being reclassified in a specific cost center. (h) Activities common to most functional\nreporting centers, such as planning, appraising, analyzing, preparing staffing\nschedules, meeting legal requirements and sanitary standards, keeping abreast\nof applicable fields, clerical work incidental to the activities of the\nfunctional reporting center, documenting work performed, initiating\nrequisitions, the provision for and receipt of in-service education, educating\npatients for self-care, maintaining specialized libraries, preparing budgets, evaluating assigned personnel and attending meetings, shall be assigned to the\nfunctional reporting center in which the activity is performed. The operation\nof equipment includes preventive maintenance such as cleaning, oiling and\ncalibration. (i) Other activities\nare unique (as herein defined) and their cost must be reported per the cost\ncenter functional descriptions. If the cost of these activities are accumulated\nin a different cost center, they must be reclassified. To assist in the\nidentification of these, a sample list of functions whose costs must\noccasionally be reclassified is included in the following Functional\n\nReclassification Matrix along with the centers to which they must be\nreclassified if they are significant.
