This does not apply to buried\npipelines or to locations where access is limited by use of fences or barriers\nto personnel that are trained in safe practices regarding step and touch\nvoltages. The short term emergency loading condition of the circuit as defined\nby the New York Power Pool for the electric facility shall be used in\ndetermining the magnitude of such step-and-touch voltages.
