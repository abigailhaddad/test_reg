Tit. 9 § 5102.15 - Application and employment after denial or revocation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any natural person whose application for\na license is denied, or whose license is suspended or revoked by reason of a\nfailure to satisfy the affirmative qualification criteria required by these\nregulations, or due to a finding by the commission that such person is\ndisqualified, or both, may re-apply for such license at any time. (b) Any natural person whose license\napplication was denied, or whose license was suspended or revoked by the\ncommission on the basis of any of the statutory or regulatory provisions in\nparagraphs (1) through (4) of this subdivision, may reapply for a license upon\nsatisfaction of the relevant requirements specified below. If the denial, suspension or revocation is based upon two or more of such regulatory\nprovisions, the commission shall permit reapplication only upon compliance with\nthe requirements of this subdivision as to each such provision. Any person\nseeking to reapply pursuant to this subdivision shall file a certified petition\nstating with particularity how the specified requirements have been satisfied. (1)\n\nFailure to demonstrate financial\nstability. Reapplication is permitted upon achieving financial\nstability. (2)\n\nFailure to satisfy\nthe age requirement. Reapplication is permitted upon attaining the requisite\nage or upon a commission finding that such age will be attained before the\nprocessing and approval of said reapplication has been completed. (3)\n\nPending disposition of a charge of a\ncriminal offense if the lottery has determined to deny a license application or\nsuspend or revoke a license while such charge is pending. Reapplication is\npermitted upon disposition of the pending charge. (4)\n\nAny statutory or regulatory provision\nthat is subsequently repealed or modified. Reapplication is permitted upon a\nshowing that the subsequent repeal or modification of the statutory or\nregulatory provision obviates the grounds for denial or revocation and\njustifies the conclusion that the prior determination should not be a basis for\ndenying a license application. (c) Except as otherwise set forth in these\nregulations, any person whose application has been denied or whose license has\nbeen revoked may reapply upon submission of sufficient evidence demonstrating\nthat the factual circumstances upon which the denial was based have been cured\nto the satisfaction of the commission. (d) Any person whose license has been revoked\nmay reapply upon submission of sufficient evidence demonstrating that the\nfactual circumstances upon which the denial was based have been\ncured.
