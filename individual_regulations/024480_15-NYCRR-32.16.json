Such electronic proof of insurance must be\ncapable of being displayed on a portable electronic device, as defined in\nparagraph (a) of subdivision two of section\n1225-d\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law.

(3)\nA driver may temporarily surrender his or\nher personal electronic device to law enforcement personnel for the purpose of\nproviding proof of insurance through an electronic insurance ID card. Such\ntemporary surrender shall cause the driver to give a limited consent for law\nenforcement personnel to utilize the electronic device on which the electronic\ninsurance ID card is located for the purpose of obtaining information regarding\nthe status of the driver's insurance only. This shall not otherwise invalidate\nany legally obtained warrant or consent to search as authorized by\nlaw. (b) Electronic\ninsurance ID cards must meet the requirements set forth in this Part that are\napplicable to paper insurance ID cards, except as to those provisions which by\ntheir nature can have no application.
