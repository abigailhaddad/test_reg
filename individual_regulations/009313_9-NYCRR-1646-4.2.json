  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-4.2 - Acquisition by condemnation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Alternative condemnation procedures are available to a local agency, once the\nprior written approval of the division to condemnation as a means of acquiring\nthe land, in lieu of private purchase, is obtained. Whatever procedure is\nadopted, the end-product will be a final decree of a court having jurisdiction, which will fix the amount of the award or confirm the amount of the award fixed\nby a board of appraisers, acting as condemnation commissioners. When the final\ndecree is handed down, the division will either concur or advise the local\nagency to appeal. (b) Commitments\nfor the acquisition of land by condemnation will, similarly, not be reflected\nin the accounts until the accounts payable voucher authorizing the drawing of a\ncheck is prepared. Accounts payable vouchers representing costs of land\nacquired by condemnation which are chargeable to account 1440.1, Land Purchase\n\nPrice, account 1440.2, Fixture Awards, and account 1440.3, Interest on\n\nCondemnation Awards, shall be supported by the final decree and by the letter\nof the division concurring in the award. (c) In the event a local agency is required\nto deposit the funds to pay a condemnation award in escrow, as where a\nmunicipality acting for the local agency requires the funds to be put up in\nadvance, or where a condemnation award is being appealed, etc., the\ndisbursement shall be charged to account 1115, Special Deposits, pending the\nrelease of the money from escrow. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1646-4.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
