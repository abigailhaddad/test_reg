(b) With respect to such insurance as is afforded, the insurer, subject to the policy terms shall: defend any suit, with the right to make such investigation, negotiation and settlement as it deems expedient; pay all premiums on attachment bonds and appeal bonds; pay all expenses incurred by the company, all costs taxed against the insured in any such suit, and all interest accruing after entry of judgment until the insurer has paid or tendered or deposited in court such part of such judgment as does not exceed the applicable policy limits; pay expenses incurred by the insured for first aid to others at the time of accident; and reimburse the insured for reasonable expenses other than loss of earnings, incurred at the company's request. The amounts so incurred under this subdivision, except settlement of claims and suits, shall be payable by the company in addition to the applicable policy limits. (c) (1)\nA provision insuring as \"insured\": (i) the named insured and, if an individual, the named insured's spouse if a resident of the same household with respect to the motor vehicle or vehicles; (ii)\nany other person using the motor vehicle with the permission of the named insured or such spouse provided the person's actual operation or (if the person is not operating) the person's other actual use thereof is within the scope of such permission; and\n(iii)\nany other person or organization but only with respect to the person's or organization's liability because of acts or omissions of an insured within subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph. (2)\n\nAs respects any person or organization other than the named insured or such spouse, the policy need not apply: (i) to any person or organization, or to any agent or employee thereof, employed or otherwise engaged in operating an automobile sales agency, repair shop, service station, storage garage or public parking place, with respect to any accident arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle in connection therewith; (ii)\nto any employee with respect to injury, sickness, disease or death of a fellow employee injured in the course of the employee's employment in an accident arising out of the maintenance or use of the motor vehicle in the business of their common employer; or\n(iii)\nto any person or organization, or to any agent or employee thereof, with respect to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, or injury to or destruction of property arising out of the loading or unloading of the motor vehicle. (3)\n\nThe insurance shall apply separately to each insured against whom claim is made or suit is brought, provided the inclusion of more than one insured shall not operate to increase the limits of the insurer's liability. (d) (1)\nA provision that, if the named insured is an individual or spouse and the policy affords insurance with respect to a private passenger automobile owned by either, such policy shall afford bodily injury and property damage liability insurance for: (i) any other private passenger automobile of which the named insured acquires ownership provided it replaces the automobile described in the policy or the company insures all automobiles owned by the named insured or the named insured's spouse on the delivery date; or\n(ii)\nany automobile, used with the permission of the owner, and not owned by the named insured or the named insured's spouse or any resident of the same household, which is temporarily substituted for the said automobile while withdrawn from service because of breakdown, servicing, repair, loss or destruction; or\n(iii)\nthe incidental use in other than a business or occupation of such insured or such insured's spouse of automobiles not owned by such named insured or a member of such named insured's household, nor furnished or available for their regular use, provided the actual operation or other actual use thereof is with the permission of the owner and is within the scope of such permission. (2)\n\nSuch a provision need not apply: (i) to any accident arising out of the maintenance or use of an automobile by a person employed or otherwise engaged in the business of an automobile sales agency, repair shop, service station, storage garage or public parking place; or\n(ii)\nwith respect to a newly acquired automobile, to any loss against which the named insured or the named insured's spouse has other valid and collectible insurance. (e) A provision that when a motor vehicle is used or operated in any other state or Canadian province, a policy currently in effect or hereafter issued shall provide at least the minimum amount and kind of coverage which is required in such cases under the laws of such other jurisdiction. Any policy not containing such provision shall nevertheless be deemed to provide such coverage. This provision is not intended to create a duplication of coverage or benefits to the extent that a New York insured carries additional coverages under any automobile or motor vehicle insurance policy or is covered under an automobile or motor vehicle policy of a resident of the jurisdiction wherein an injury occurs. (f) A provision that assault and battery shall be deemed an accident unless committed by or at the direction of the insured. (Not required if policy is written on an occurrence basis in which event the policy shall be subject to an exclusion pertaining to bodily injury or property damage caused intentionally by or at the direction of the insured.)\n(g) Either of the following provisions: (1)\n\nThe insurer shall not be liable for a greater proportion of the loss than the applicable limit of liability of the policy bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all other valid and collectible insurance covering the insured against such loss; provided, however, with respect to an automobile, other than a newly acquired automobile, for which insurance is provided under subdivision (d) of this section, the insurance shall be excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance. (2)\n\nThe insurance afforded by this policy is primary insurance, except when stated to apply in excess of or contingent upon the absence of other insurance. When this insurance is primary and the insured has other insurance which is stated to be applicable to the loss on an excess or contingent basis, the amount of the company's liability under this policy shall not be reduced by the existence of such other insurance. When both this insurance and other insurance apply to the loss on the same basis, whether primary, excess or contingent, the company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of the loss than that stated in the applicable contribution provision below: (i) Contribution by equal shares. If all of such other valid and collectible insurance provides for contribution by equal shares, the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such loss than would be payable if each insurer contributes an equal share until the share of each insurer equals the lowest applicable limit of liability under any one policy or the full amount of the loss is paid, and with respect to any amount of loss not so paid the remaining insurers then continue to contribute equal shares of the remaining amount of the loss until each such insurer has paid its limit in full or the full amount of the loss is paid. (ii)\n\nContribution by limits. If any of such other insurance does not provide for contribution by equal shares, the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability under this policy for such loss bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss. With respect to the maintenance or use of hired automobiles and nonowned automobiles, this insurance shall apply only as excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance available to the insured. (h) A provision that if the insurer cancels the policy, at least 20 days prior written notice must be mailed or delivered to the named insured, except where the cancellation is for nonpayment of premium in which case 15 days notice of cancellation by the insurer shall be sufficient.

As respects any person or organization other than the\nnamed insured\nor such spouse the policy need not apply: (i) to any person or organization, or to any agent or employee thereof, employed or otherwise engaged in operating an\nautomobile\nsales agency, repair shop, service station, storage garage or public parking place, with respect to any accident arising out of the maintenance or use of a motor vehicle in connection therewith; (ii)\nto any employee with respect to injury, sickness, disease or death of a fellow employee injured in the course of his or her employment in an accident arising out of the maintenance or use of the motor vehicle in the business of their common employer; or\n(iii)\nto any person or organization, or to any agent or employee thereof, with respect to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death, or injury to or destruction of property arising out of the loading or unloading of the motor vehicle. The insurance shall apply separately to each\ninsured\nagainst whom claim is made or suit is brought, provided the inclusion of more than one\ninsured\nshall not operate to increase the limits of the insurer's liability. (d) (1)\nA provision that, if the\nnamed insured\nis an individual or husband or wife and the policy affords insurance with respect to a\nprivate passenger automobile\nowned by either, such policy shall afford bodily injury and property damage liability insurance for: (i) any other\nprivate passenger automobile\nof which the\nnamed insured\nacquires ownership provided it replaces the\nautomobile\ndescribed in the policy or the company insures all automobiles owned by the\nnamed insured\nor his spouse on the delivery date; or\n(ii)\nany\nautomobile, used with the permission of the owner, and not owned by the\nnamed insured\nor his spouse or any resident of the same household, which is temporarily substituted for the said\nautomobile\nwhile withdrawn from service because of breakdown, servicing, repair, loss or destruction; or\n(iii)\nthe incidental use in other than a business or occupation of such\ninsured\nor his spouse of automobiles not owned by such\nnamed insured\nor a member of his household, nor furnished or available for their regular use, provided the actual operation or other actual use thereof is with the permission of the owner and is within the scope of such permission.

(e) A provision that when a motor vehicle is used or operated in any other state or Canadian province, a policy currently in effect or hereafter issued shall provide at least the minimum amount and kind of coverage which is required in such cases under the laws of such other jurisdiction. Any policy not containing such provision shall nevertheless be deemed to provide such coverage. This provision is not intended to create a duplication of coverage or benefits to the extent that a New York\ninsured\ncarries additional coverages under any\nautomobile\nor motor vehicle insurance policy or is covered under an\nautomobile\nor motor vehicle policy of a resident of the jurisdiction wherein an injury occurs. (f) A provision that assault and battery shall be deemed an accident unless committed by or at the direction of the\ninsured.

(2)\n\nThe insurance afforded by this policy is primary insurance, except when stated to apply in excess of or contingent upon the absence of other insurance. When this insurance is primary and the\ninsured\nhas other insurance which is stated to be applicable to the loss on an excess or contingent basis, the amount of the company's liability under this policy shall not be reduced by the existence of such other insurance. When both this insurance and other insurance apply to the loss on the same basis, whether primary, excess or contingent, the company shall not be liable under this policy for a greater proportion of the loss than that stated in the applicable contribution provision below: (i) Contribution by equal shares. If all of such other valid and collectible insurance provides for contribution by equal shares, the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such loss than would be payable if each insurer contributes an equal share until the share of each insurer equals the lowest applicable limit of liability under any one policy or the full amount of the loss is paid, and with respect to any amount of loss not so paid the remaining insurers then continue to contribute equal shares of the remaining amount of the loss until each such insurer has paid its limit in full or the full amount of the loss is paid. (ii)\n\nContribution by limits. If any of such other insurance does not provide for contribution by equal shares, the company shall not be liable for a greater proportion of such loss than the applicable limit of liability under this policy for such loss bears to the total applicable limit of liability of all valid and collectible insurance against such loss. With respect to the maintenance or use of hired automobiles and nonowned automobiles, this insurance shall apply only as excess insurance over any other valid and collectible insurance available to the\ninsured. (h) A provision that if the insurer cancels the policy, at least 20 days prior written notice must be mailed or delivered to the\nnamed insured, except where the cancellation is for nonpayment of premium in which case 15 days notice of cancellation by the insurer shall be sufficient.
