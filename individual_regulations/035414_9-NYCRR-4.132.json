  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.132 - Executive order no. 132: establishing a state facilities energy conservation program\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, despite much progress in energy conservation\nefforts, there remains a considerable need and opportunity for improving the\nefficient use of energy consumed by State-owned and operated buildings and\nfacilities, which can significantly decrease the State's overall energy-related\nexpenses and the need for public funds for such purposes; WHEREAS, the barriers to energy conservation in State-owned\nand operated buildings and facilities must be addressed by a combination of\nactions that include new fiscal incentives, improved administrative procedures, centralized budgeting and fiscal control, and expanded technical\nassistance; WHEREAS, programs directed towards increasing energy\nefficiency in State-owned and operated buildings and facilities are currently\nadministered or supported by numerous State agencies, and the effectiveness of\nthese programs and the efficient use of limited Federal, State and other funds\navailable for energy conservation in these facilities would be enhanced greatly\nthrough increased coordination among such agencies; WHEREAS, Section 5-107 of the Energy Law authorizes the\n\nState Energy Office to promulgate energy use standards for the purchase, lease, use or maintenance of State buildings and equipment; and\nWHEREAS, government should operate as an example to all New\n\nYorkers that energy efficiency improves productivity, provides equal, if not\nbetter, service at lower cost, and has widespread environmental\nbenefits; NOW, THEREFORE, I, MARIO M. CUOMO, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby direct the State Energy Office, in\ncooperation with the Division of the Budget, the Office of General Services, the Interagency Energy Managers Association and other State agencies as\nindicated herein, to undertake a State Facilities Energy Conservation Program, which will establish and implement a plan to undertake energy efficiency and\nconservation measures and reduce energy costs in State buildings and\noperations. I. Purpose and Objectives. The purpose of this Order is to establish a program which\nwill strengthen the State's commitment to achieve energy cost reductions and\nefficiency improvements in State-owned and operated buildings and\nfacilities. To that end, the State shall institute a State Facilities\n\nEnergy Conservation Program (Program) which shall be headed by the State Energy\n\nOffice, in cooperation with the Division of the Budget, the Office of General\n\nServices, the Interagency Energy Managers Association and other State agencies\nas appropriate. The principal objectives of the Program shall be to: * Achieve an overall reduction of the State's energy\nconsumption in its buildings and facilities of 20 percent by the year\n2000; * Identify and implement cost effective energy conservation\nimprovements in all State-owned and operated buildings and facilities; * Institute incentives for reducing energy operating costs\nand encouraging State agencies to continually make investments in energy\nefficiency improvements; * Establish priorities among energy efficiency improvements\nto insure that available funds are used first for those energy projects which\nwill achieve the greatest energy and cost savings to the State; * Streamline and accelerate the process for evaluating, approving and implementing energy efficiency projects; * Expand options for financing energy projects by\nmaximizing the use of non-state funding sources for energy efficient capital\nimprovements; and\n* Establish clear responsibility for undertaking energy\nconservation activities within and among agencies to insure a continuing\ncommitment to energy cost reduction. II. Program Description. A. Submission of Annual Plans. 1. Each State agency that operates\n\nState-owned buildings shall prepare in cooperation with the Division of the\n\nBudget an annual Plan for identifying and implementing energy efficiency\nimprovements with simple payback periods of five years or less, thereby\nreducing energy consumption in such agency's existing buildings and\ncontributing to the overall reduction in State building energy consumption of\n20 percent by the year 2000. Contributions to such overall State goal may vary\namong agencies depending, in part, on each agency's energy consumption and\nimplementation of energy conservation measures prior to the issuance of this\n\nExecutive Order. Agency shall mean any State department, agency, board, commission, bureau, office or division. The Plans shall be prepared in\naccordance with the format to be specified by the State Energy Office and shall\ncontain at least such information as set forth in the Memorandum being issued\nby the Commissioner of Energy contemporaneously herewith, and any amendments\nthereto. 2. Each agency shall\nprepare its first annual Plan in cooperation with the Division of the Budget by\n\nAugust 1, 1990 and shall prepare such Plans annually thereafter. Each agency\nmay, however, be required to submit pertinent information to the State Energy\n\nOffice prior to such date in accordance with the milestones established by the\n\nState Energy Office pursuant to Section III.A. of this Executive Order. The\n\nDivision of the Budget shall consider the annual Plans in making its annual\nbudget recommendations to the Governor. B. Technical Assistance Studies and Energy\n\nAudits. Technical assistance studies or energy audits shall be\nconducted on all buildings not previously the subject of such a study or audit, as specified in the aforementioned Memorandum being issued by the Commissioner\nof Energy, within five years after the date of this Executive Order. Updates of\npreviously conducted technical assistance studies or audits shall also be\nconducted in accordance with the aforementioned Memorandum. Each agency shall\nbe responsible for assuring that the required technical assistance studies and\naudits are conducted and shall, to the extent possible, take advantage of audit\nand technical assistance services available through utility programs, the State\n\nFacilities Energy Conservation Program as funded by petroleum overcharge\nrestitutionary funds, and the Federal Institutional Conservation Program. The\n\nState Energy Office shall also provide training to agencies interested in\nconducting their own audits. III. State Energy Office Program\n\nResponsibilities. The State Energy Office shall: A. Provide technical assistance to State\nagencies in preparing their annual Plans.
