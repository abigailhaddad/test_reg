  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 13 § 16.11 - Guidelines for non-specified property real estate syndication offerings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) These guidelines apply to nonspecified property syndications (hereinafter called \"programs\") in the form of\nlimited partnerships. To the extent appropriate, they will also be applied to nonspecified property programs in forms other than limited\npartnerships. As used herein, the term\nnonspecified property\nor\nblind pool\nprogram shall mean an investment program\nin which the offering statement or prospectus does not clearly set forth the specific property or properties to be purchased, leased, mortgaged or\notherwise financed with at least 75 percent of the net proceeds of the offering; or a program in which the proceeds of any sale or refinancing of\nproperties may be reinvested. Reserves shall be included in the nonspecified 25 percent. (b) This section\nis not intended to be exclusive. All of the regulations, requirements, standards and policies of the Department of Law otherwise applicable to real\nestate syndication offerings shall apply to nonspecified property programs. (c) These guidelines set\nforth some of the criteria that will be weighed in exercising the discretion contained in sections\n352-e\n(1)-(2), 252-g and\n359-f (2)\nof the General Business Law. The Department of Law\nretains full discretion to refuse to issue a filing letter or to deny an exemption to a nonspecified property offering which meets all of the\nconditions of this section, whenever in its sole judgment such refusal or denial is warranted by the particular facts and circumstances and is\nnecessary for the protection of investors. (d) In determining whether to issue a filing letter or grant\nan application to exempt from filing a nonspecified property offering, the Attorney General will apply the following guidelines: (1)\n\nStatement of policy regarding real estate programs. All of the provisions of the \"Statement of Policy Regarding Real Estate\n\nPrograms\" adopted by the North American Securities Administrators Association, Inc. and currently in effect, are incorporated herein by reference. Those provisions are an integral part of these guidelines and will be applied to nonspecified property programs except to the extent that particular\nrequirements of this subdivision are more stringent than, and therefore supersede, specific requirements thereof. (2)\n\nMinimum capitalization. The minimum gross proceeds of the offering must be at least\n$2,500,000. (3)\n\nMaximum capitalization. Offerings of total dollar amounts which are excessively large in\nrelationship to the prior experience and demonstrated capabilities of the principals or are otherwise inconsistent with responsible investment\ncriteria, will be denied exemption or refused filing. (4)\n\nExperience of sponsor. The sponsor(s) or at least one principal must establish that he has had\nthe equivalent of not less than five years experience in the acquisition and management of the type of properties to be acquired; or otherwise must\ndemonstrate to the satisfaction of the Attorney General that he has sufficient related knowledge and experience to acquire and manage the type of\nproperties to be acquired. (5)\n\nNet worth of general partner. The financial condition of the general partner(s) or other principals\nliable for the debts of the program, must be commensurate with any financial obligations assumed in the offering and in the operation of the program. As a minimum, the general partners shall have an aggregate financial net worth exclusive of homes, automobiles and home furnishings, of the greater\nof either $250,000 or an amount at least equal to five percent of the gross amount of all offerings sold within the prior 12 months, plus five\npercent of the current offering, to an aggregate maximum net worth requirement of $1,500,000. Evaluation will be made of contingent liabilities and\nthe use of promissory notes to determine the appropriateness of their inclusion in computing net worth. (6)\n\nSuitability standards. Suitability standards for investors must be imposed which are reasonable\nin light of the type of program, its specific tax orientation, the lack of liquidity, limited transferability and the inherent risk involved. Unless\nthe Department of Law approves a lower suitability standard, each investor shall have a minimum annual gross income of $35,000 and a net worth of\n$35,000 or alternatively, a net worth of $100,000. For high risk offerings, higher suitability standards may be required. Net worth shall be\ndetermined exclusive of home, home furnishings and automobiles. (7)\n\nSuitability reports. The sponsor or general partner of the program shall file a pre-effective\nundertaking with the Attorney General that all New York residents purchasing interests in the program will be appropriate in light of the required\nsuitability standards and a post closing affidavit (which may be based on written representations of the underwriters and purchasers) confirming that\nthe suitability requirements have been met with respect to such purchasers. (8)\n\nMinimum\ninvestment. A minimum initial cash purchase of $2,500 per investor shall be required. However a minimum of $1,000 shall apply to a purchase by an individual retirement account. Subsequent transfers of such interest shall be in units of\nnot less than $2,500, except for transfers by an individual retirement account, transfers by gift, inheritance, intra-family transfers, transfers\nsubsequent to the preceding, and transfers to affiliates. (9)\n\nInvestment objectives. (i) The prospectus must contain an accurate and detailed statement of the investment pruposes of the program, the\ntypes of properties to be acquired and, to the extent practicable, the investment criteria to be applied. The size and scope of projects shall be\nconsistent with the objectives of the program and the experience of the sponsor. (ii)\n\nThe prospectus must\nrestrict investments in unimproved and nonincome producing property to not more than 15 percent of the proceeds available for investment. (10)\n\nReinvestment. (i) The program must provide that if acquired\nproperty is sold or refinanced and the proceeds are reinvested, acquisition or other fees or commissions for reinvestment may be paid directly or\nindirectly to the sponsors or their affiliates only if the limitation on maximum compensation for investment in properties is not exceeded. (ii)\n\nOfferings not registered with the SEC will generally be required to return to the partners all net proceeds\nupon the sale or refinancing of property. (11)\n\nEscrow required. (i) The prospectus must contain an undertaking that prior to the initial closing of the offering, all moneys\nreceived from subscribers will be held in trust for their benefit in a special escrow account; that all moneys received from subscribers after an\ninitial closing will also be held in trust for their benefit in a special escrow account; and that a subscriber's funds will only be released to the\nissuer pursuant to a closing at which the subscriber becomes a partner or other participant. (ii)\n\nThe\nprospectus must contain an undertaking that proceeds of the offering will be received by the issuer at any closing to be used only for the purposes\nset forth in the prospectus and that any proceeds not invested or committed within two years from the date of effectiveness (except for necessary\noperating capital) shall be distributed\npro rata\nto the partners as a return of capital. (12)\n\nNonspecified status. The cover page identification of material risks shall include an\nappropriate statement to the effect that prospective investors will not have the opportunity to evaluate any real properties to be acquired by the\npartnership because the partnership owns no real property, has not identified any specific property it intends to purchase and does not have an\noperating history. Include a cross-reference to further information in the prospectus. (13)\n\nCross-reference sheet. A cross-reference sheet must be submitted for each nonspecified property\nprogram, setting forth: (i) the specific location in the partnership agreement and/or prospectus of\ncompliance with, or variance from, each of the provisions of these guidelines; (ii)\nthe specific variance\nfrom each provision, including the provisions of the NASAA \"Statement of Policy Regarding Real Estate Programs\" (paragraph [1] of this subdivision)\nor that specific provisions are inapplicable; and\n(iii)\nthe specific section of the partnership agreement\nincorporating each provision which NASAA \"Statement of Policy Regarding Real Estate Programs\" (paragraph [1] of this subdivision) requires to be\nincluded in the partnership agreement.
