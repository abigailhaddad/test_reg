  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 160.2 - Court Referral of Civil Disputes to ADR\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nAs\nprovided in this Part, a state-funded court of the UCS shall refer each civil\ndispute pending before it to an appropriate ADR process at the earliest\npracticable time unless: (i) such referral is prohibited under statute, local\nrule of court, or administrative order of the Chief Administrator of the Courts\nor the Chief Administrator's designee, (ii) the court determines that the\nparties cannot participate effectively in an ADR process or that, for any other\nreason, referral to such a process will not serve the interests of justice, (iii) a party to the dispute objects to and opts out from such referral in\naccordance with local rule of court or administrative order of the Chief\n\nAdministrator or designee (iv) the court determines, in consultation with the\nlocal Administrative Judge, that insufficient ADR resources, including but not\nlimited to, mediators and neutral evaluators, are currently available, or (v)\nthere are allegations of domestic violence as defined by the New York State\n\nOffice for the Prevention of Domestic Violence or of child abuse or neglect. (2)\n\nAt the earliest practicable\ntime, a court shall inform the parties to such dispute regarding the available\nADR processes. To the extent possible, the court shall provide the parties, or\ntheir counsel, with access to written or electronic materials describing: (i)\nhow ADR is used to resolve a dispute (including how it may provide\nopportunities for exchanges of information to facilitate accelerated resolution\nof disputes), (ii) the associated costs of ADR, if any, and (iii) how a party\ncan opt out of a referral to ADR pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nWhere a court refers a dispute\nto an ADR process under this Part, the court shall refer such dispute to\nmediation unless there are compelling reasons to select another ADR process. In\ndetermining whether such compelling reasons exist, the court shall consider all\nrelevant factors, including but not limited to: (i) any preference for a\nparticular ADR process expressed by the parties to the dispute, (ii) the\nspecific issues raised by the dispute, (iii) whether a party or parties to the\ndispute are unrepresented; and (iv) the availability of ADR processes other\nthan mediation. (4)\n\nWhere the\nparties in a family court or matrimonial matter are referred to mediation under\nthis Part, the parties shall be screened using a standardized mediation\nscreening tool developed by the Statewide ADR Office of the UCS, to determine\nwhether it is appropriate for mediation to proceed. This screening is in\naddition to any statutory registry checks under section\n240\n(1)(a)\nof the Domestic Relations Law and\nsection\n651\n(e) of the Family Court Act. Where mediation\nis determined to be inappropriate, the matter shall be returned to the\nreferring court. (5)\n\nReferrals in\naccordance with this section may be to a neutral third party chosen by the\nparties to the dispute or, as appropriate, to a roster mediator, to a roster\nneutral evaluator, to mediation-trained court staff, or to a community dispute\nresolution center. Where the parties agree upon the choice of a neutral third\nparty, they shall provide notice thereof to the court's ADR administrative\npersonnel, as prescribed by the court. (6)\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, a court\nmay at any time remove a dispute from an ADR process to which it already has\nbeen referred where: (i) the court determines that such referral does not serve\nthe interests of justice; or (ii) a party to the dispute objects to and opts\nout from such referral in accordance with local rule of court or administrative\norder of the Chief Administrator of the Courts or the Chief Administrator's\ndesignee. (b) Referral\nto a neutral third party. (1)\n\nWhere a\nreferral in accordance with this section is to a mediator or neutral evaluator, other than one chosen by the parties to the dispute, such mediator or neutral\nevaluator must qualify under Part 146 of the Rule of the Chief Administrator of\nthe Courts (22 NYCRR Part\n146\n) or, in the case of a mediator, be eligible to\nserve as a mediator pursuant to rules of the Chief Administrator applicable to\ncommunity dispute resolution centers, and meet such additional criteria as the\ncourt may prescribe. (2)\n\nCourts may\nestablish protocols for (i) the selection of neutral third parties, (ii) the\nreferral of disputes to them, (iii) their compensation, (iv) the manner in\nwhich complaints of the parties about their conduct may be addressed, consistent with such statewide complaint process as shall have been approved by\nthe Chief Administrator and such disciplinary process as may be applicable to\nnonjudicial employees of the UCS, and (v) the options available where one or\nmore of the parties are unable to pay the costs of ADR. Nothing in this\nparagraph shall prohibit the Chief Administrator from prescribing, by\nadministrative order, rules of general applicability regulating the\ncompensation of neutral third parties in appropriate case types.
