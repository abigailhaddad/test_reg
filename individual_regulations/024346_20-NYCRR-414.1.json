  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 414.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 4, 284(1), 289-c, 289-f\n(a) (1)\n\nThe\nmotor fuel tax imposed pursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law is not required\nto be paid when motor fuel is imported into New York State or caused to be\nimported into New York State by a distributor for use, distribution, storage or\nsale in the State or when motor fuel is produced, refined, manufactured, compounded or sold by a distributor in the State, under any circumstances which\nmight preclude the collection of the tax by reason of the United States\n\nConstitution and any laws of the United States enacted pursuant\nthereto. (2)\n\nThe motor fuel tax is\nnot required to be paid in respect of motor fuel imported or caused to be\nimported into the State, or produced, refined, manufactured or compounded in\nthe State by: (i) the United States of\n\nAmerica, and any of its agencies and instrumentalities; (ii)\n\nNew York State, or any of its agencies, instrumentalities, public corporations (including a public corporation created\npursuant to agreement or compact with another state or Canada) or political\nsubdivisions (including school districts); or\n(iii)\na hospital which holds a current\noperating certificate issued by the New York State Department of Health\npursuant to the authority of section\n2805\nof the Public Health Law or by the New\n\nYork State Department of Mental Hygiene pursuant to the authority of article 31\nof the Mental Hygiene Law and which qualifies as an exempt organization\npursuant to section\n1116 (a)(4)\nof the Tax Law, if such motor fuel is for the entities' own use or consumption. Such entities\nmay also purchase at retail, for their use or consumption, motor fuel upon\nwhich the seller has not passed through the motor fuel tax. (3)\n\nMotor fuel upon which the\nseller has not passed through the motor fuel tax may be acquired in the State\nby a purchaser which is a duly registered or licensed distributor of, or dealer\nin, motor fuel in another state or province of a foreign country and will\nimmediately export such motor fuel to an identified facility in that state or\nprovince for the purpose of selling such motor fuel. (4)\n\nAs described in sections\n414.4\nand\n414.5\nof this\n\nPart, retail purchases of motor fuel charged to authorized oil company credit\ncards by: (i) diplomatic missions and\ndiplomatic personnel; and\n(ii)\nthe\n\nUnited Nations, may be billed to such purchasers exclusive of the motor fuel\ntax. Motor fuel so purchased must be used or consumed by such individual or\nentity. (b) Although exemptions from the motor fuel tax exist only to the extent provided\nfor in this Part, refunds, credits and reimbursements may be allowed in other\ncircumstances. (See Part 415 of this Title.)\n(c) (1)\n\nIt\nis presumed that all motor fuel in this State is subject to tax until the\ncontrary is established. Pursuant to the joint administrative provisions of\nsections\n289-f\nand\n1142 (11)\nof the Tax Law, any person or entity purchasing\nmotor fuel and entitled to an exemption from tax in accordance with this Part\nmust furnish its seller (or have furnished to its seller on its behalf) proper\ndocumentation substantiating its right to the exemption claimed. Upon\npresentation of the proper documentation, the tax on motor fuel imposed\npursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law as well as the taxes imposed by article\n28 and pursuant to the authority of article 29 of such law in respect to motor\nfuel need not be passed through, billed or collected, as the case may be, by\nthe seller of such fuel. Documentation substantiating an exempt transaction\nmust be retained by the seller for at least three years following the date the\ntransaction was required to be reported to the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance or the date the transaction was actually reported to the department, if\nlater. For penalties relating to false or fraudulent exemption certificates or\ndocuments, see section\n1145 (a)(5)\nand article\n37\nof the Tax Law. (2)\n(i) In\norder to make purchases of motor fuel upon which the seller has not passed\nthrough the motor fuel tax, a purchaser must: (a) furnish to the seller a properly\ncompleted certificate to the effect that the purchaser is entitled to acquire\nmotor fuel upon which the tax has not been passed through, on a form which the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance has prescribed for such purpose, together\nwith such other information as the department may require; (b) furnish to the seller a government\npurchase contract, purchase order or the appropriate exemption document, where\nthe purchaser is a governmental entity described in subparagraphs (a)(2)(i) and\n(ii) of this section; or\n(c) purchase such motor fuel, with a valid credit card issued by an oil company, pursuant to the provisions of sections\n414.4\nand\n414.5\nof this\n\nPart, where the purchaser is an individual or entity described in paragraph\n(a)(4) of this section. (ii)\n(a) When a person sells motor fuel without passing through to the purchaser the\nmotor fuel tax as provided for in this Part, as proof of the exemption the\nseller must obtain from the purchaser and retain in his files either: (1)\na properly completed certificate to the\neffect that the purchaser is entitled to acquire motor fuel upon which the tax\nhas not been passed through; or\n(2)\na government purchase contract or order, or the appropriate exemption document, where the purchaser is a governmental entity described in subparagraphs\n(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. (b) In the case of a credit card sale of\nmotor fuel to a purchaser described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section, as\nproof of the exemption the United States Department of State or the American\n\nInstitute in Taiwan must certify to an oil company that an individual or entity\nis in fact exempt from tax. Such oil company must retain in its files a copy of\nsaid certification. On such certification and the issuance of an authorized\ncredit card, the oil company will bill the individual or entity, exclusive of\nthe taxes from which such purchaser is exempt. (See sections\n414.4\nand\n414.5\nof this\n\nPart.)\n(d) (1)\n\nThe\nburden of proving that any sale of motor fuel is not subject to the tax is upon\nthe purchaser of the motor fuel and, except as otherwise provided for in this\nsubdivision, is also upon the person required to pass through the\ntax. (2)\nA seller of motor fuel\nwho, within 90 days after the delivery of such fuel, in good faith accepts from\nthe purchaser a properly completed exemption certificate or other document\nevidencing exemption from tax, is relieved of the liability for failure to have\npassed through the tax with respect to that transaction and the burden of\nproving that such sale of motor fuel is not subject to tax is solely on the\npurchaser. Provided, however, a seller of motor fuel shall be relieved of\nliability for failure to have passed through the tax on sales for export under\nparagraph (a)(3) of this section only if such seller receives, and accepts in\ngood faith, the properly completed certificate prescribed by the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance at or prior to the time of delivery of such motor fuel. (i) A certificate or other document is\naccepted in good faith when a seller of motor fuel has no actual knowledge that\nthe exemption certificate or other document issued by the purchaser is false or\nis fraudulently presented. (ii)\nA\ncertificate is considered to be properly completed when it contains: (a) the date prepared; (b) the name and address of the\npurchaser; (c) the name and address\nof the seller; (d) the\nidentification number of the purchaser as shown on its certificate of\nauthority, certificate of registration or exempt organization number as shown\non the exempt organization certificate, if any such numbers are\nrequired; (e) the signature of the\npurchaser or the purchaser's authorized representative; and\n(f) any other information required to be\ncompleted on the particular certificate or document. (iii)\n\nFor the purposes of this subdivision, the term\n90 days after the delivery of the motor fuel\nmeans\nthat date 90 days after the date actual possession of the motor fuel is\ntransferred to the purchaser. If actual possession is not transferred to the\npurchaser, such term means that date 90 days after the earlier of transfer of\ntitle or constructive possession to the purchaser. (e) The provisions of this Part\nwith respect to purchases and sales of motor fuel are controlling whenever they\nare in conflict with the other provisions of this Title. In all other respects, the provisions of Subchapter J of this Title (Sales and Use Taxes) shall apply\nto purchases and sales of motor fuel so far as such provisions can be made\napplicable to the taxes imposed by article 12-A of the Tax Law with such\nlimitations as are set forth in this Part and such modifications as may be\nnecessary in order to adapt such provisions to the provisions of this\n\nPart.
