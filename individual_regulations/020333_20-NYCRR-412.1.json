  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 412.1 - Tax imposition\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 284, 284-a, 284-c, 285, 285-a, 287\n(a) (1)\n\nExcept as provided for in this section, every distributor must pay an aggregate\nexcise tax of eight cents per gallon on each gallon of motor fuel which it\nimports or causes to be imported into New York State for use, distribution, storage or sale in the State. The liability for the tax is imposed on the owner\nof the motor fuel being imported at the time the offloading of such motor fuel\nis commenced at or into any terminal, facility or any other land-sited\nrepository. In determining the amount of the tax, the motor fuel is to be\nmeasured by the amount of motor fuel which is offloaded into the terminal, facility or other land-sited repository. The person who owns such fuel while it\nis held in the truck, vessel or other means of transportation at the time of\nthe commencement of offloading of the fuel is the party responsible for the\npayment of the tax. Provided, however, when motor fuel which is being imported\nfor use, distribution, storage or sale in the State is sold after it has been\nloaded by the transporter but before it has been offloaded at or into any\nterminal, facility or other land-sited repository in the State and, in such\ninstance, the name of the immediate purchaser does not appear on the current\nlisting of registered distributors prepared by the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance, the person selling to such purchaser is jointly and severally liable\nfor the taxes with respect to such motor fuel. In addition, the seller in that\ninstance shall be presumed to have knowingly aided and abetted a person who is\nnot registered as a distributor in the importation of motor fuel for the\npurpose of registration cancellation or suspension under section\n283 (4)(iii)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (2)\n\nWhere the circumstances of\nan importation transaction indicate that a person or persons, other than the\nperson indicated as the owner of the motor fuel at the time of offloading, is\ndirecting or controlling such transaction, the person or persons directing or\ncontrolling the importation is jointly and severally liable for the payment of\nthe tax. Provided further, if the owner of the motor fuel at the time that\noffloading is commenced is not registered as a distributor of motor fuel\npursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law, then the owner of the motor fuel\nimmediately after it is offloaded is jointly and severally liable for payment\nof the tax with such unregistered owner. (3)\n\nIn no event shall the tax be collected\nmore than once with respect to a particular importation of motor\nfuel. (b) Except as\nprovided for in this section, every distributor must pay an aggregate excise\ntax of eight cents per gallon on each gallon of motor fuel which it produces, refines, manufactures or compounds in New York State. The liability for the tax\nis imposed on the distributor at the time the production, refining, manufacturing or compounding has been completed and the resulting product or\nby-product constitutes motor fuel as defined in this Title. In determining the\namount of the tax, the motor fuel is to be measured by the amount of motor fuel\nwhich exists upon completion of the production, refining, manufacturing or\ncompounding processes in the State. Where motor fuel is produced, refined, manufactured or compounded in the State from ingredients which in and of\nthemselves are motor fuel and the taxes on such ingredients imposed pursuant to\narticles 12-A, 28 and 29 of the Tax Law with respect to motor fuel have been\nassumed or paid as evidenced by certifications of tax payment (see sections\n412.3\nand\n412.4\nof this Part), the quantity of such ingredients shall be used as a credit\nagainst the amount of motor fuel produced, refined, manufactured or compounded\nin this State to the extent such taxes have been assumed or paid thereon. In no\nevent shall the tax in the aggregate be collected more than once with respect\nto the production, refining, manufacturing or compounding of motor fuel in New\n\nYork State. (c) (1)\n\nMotor fuel may be imported or caused to\nbe imported into New York State for use, distribution, storage or sale in the\n\nState and motor fuel may be produced, refined, manufactured, compounded or sold\nin New York State by a distributor without payment of the motor fuel tax\nimposed pursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law under circumstances which\npreclude the collection of such tax by reason of the United States Constitution\nand any laws enacted pursuant thereto. Motor fuel may also be imported or\ncaused to be imported, or produced, refined, manufactured or compounded in New\n\nYork State without payment of the motor fuel tax by: (i) the United States of America, and any of\nits agencies and instrumentalities; (ii)\n\nNew York State, or any of its agencies, instrumentalities, public corporations (including a public corporation created\npursuant to agreement or compact with another state or Canada) or political\nsubdivisions (including school districts); or\n(iii)\na hospital which holds a current\noperating certificate issued by the New York State Department of Health\npursuant to the authority of section\n2805\nof the Public Health Law or by the New\n\nYork State Department of Mental Hygiene pursuant to the authority of article 31\nof the Mental Hygiene Law and which qualifies as an exempt organization\npursuant to section\n1116 (a)(4)\nof the Tax Law, if such motor fuel is for such entities' own use or consumption. (See Part 414\nof this Title for exemptions.)\n(2)\n\nWhere motor fuel is imported into the\n\nState or caused to be imported into the State for use, distribution, storage or\nsale in the State or when motor fuel is produced, refined, manufactured or\ncompounded in the State, as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision or\nin any other event, the aggregate excise tax of eight cents per gallon must be\npaid on each gallon of motor fuel sold (as a sale is defined in section\n410.2\nof\nthis Title) by a distributor if the tax has not been imposed prior to its sale\nin this State and such sale is not precluded from the imposition of tax. Example: A qualified hospital imports motor fuel into New York\n\nState for use in its own motor vehicles and is accordingly not required to pay\nthe tax in respect of such importation. Occasionally such motor fuel is\nsupplied by the hospital into motor vehicles of others. The motor fuel tax\nimposed pursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law must be paid by the hospital on\neach gallon of motor fuel supplied to the motor vehicles of\nothers. (3)\n\nIf any person, firm, association or corporation receives any motor fuel in such form and under\nsuch circumstances as to preclude the collection of the motor fuel tax from a\ndistributor by reason of the Constitution and Laws of the United States and\nthereafter sells or uses any of such motor fuel under circumstances as may be\nsubject to tax, such person, firm, association or corporation is considered a\ndistributor of motor fuel with respect to such sale or use. All the provisions\nof article 12-A of the Tax Law relating to distributors will apply to such\nperson, firm, association or corporation. (d) (1)\nA\ndistributor of motor fuel who or which stores motor fuel in the State on which\nsuch distributor has paid the taxes imposed pursuant to article 12-A of the Tax\n\nLaw will be allowed an adjustment in arriving at the gallons of motor fuel\nsubject to tax on account of the gallons of motor fuel the distributor\nestablishes to the satisfaction of the Department of Taxation and Finance were\nlost due to shrinkage, evaporation and handling. In no event will such\nallowance exceed two percent of the motor fuel stored. (2)\n\nProvided further, that in arriving at the\ngallons of motor fuel subject to tax there is also allowed an adjustment on\naccount of the gallons of motor fuel lost or destroyed due to accident, such as\na fire, at the time such gallons of motor fuel were being held or transported\nfor sale other than at retail. (3)\n\nThe burden of proving that any motor fuel is not so subject to tax is upon the\nperson claiming the adjustment. (e) The motor fuel tax imposed pursuant to\narticle 12-A of the Tax Law must be remitted with a monthly return which is\nrequired to be filed on or before the 20th day of the month following the month\nfor which the return is made. (See Part 413 of this Title.)\n(f) Whenever motor fuel is subject to tax\npursuant to this Title, such tax is required to be passed through to any\npurchaser of such fuel. Whenever such motor fuel is sold for purposes of\nresale, the seller must give the purchaser a certification of tax payment when\nthe fuel is delivered. (See sections\n412.3\nand\n412.4\nof this Part for information with respect to the certifications of tax\npayment.) A seller of motor fuel is relieved of the requirement to pass through\nthe tax if it receives from the purchaser a properly completed certification\n(as prescribed by the Department of Taxation and Finance) indicating that the\npurchaser is a duly registered or licensed distributor of, or dealer in, motor\nfuel in another state or province of a foreign country, and will immediately\nexport the motor fuel being purchased to an identified location in that state\nor province for the purpose of selling such motor fuel. (g) Unless the motor fuel tax was not\nrequired to be passed through to it pursuant to subdivision (f) of this\nsection, no person may purchase motor fuel in this State unless the tax\nrequired to be paid has been paid or assumed by a distributor of motor fuel\nregistered under article 12-A of the Tax Law and except as provided in such\nsubdivision, no person may purchase motor fuel in this State, excluding a\npurchase at retail, without having received from the seller a certification of\ntax payment to the effect that such tax has been paid or assumed by such a\ndistributor.
