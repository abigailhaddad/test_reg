  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 605.3 - Carrier involvement with content\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General requirement. No telephone\ncorporation operating as a common carrier shall exercise control or influence\nover the content of lawful communications tendered to it for distribution. In\nturn, it has no liability for the content of tendered communications. This does\nnot diminish a telephone corporation's duty to provide service of adequate\ntransmission quality, capacity and timeliness. (b) Safeguards against abuse. Telephone\ncorporations operating as common carriers shall make reasonable efforts to\ninform each content service provider, serving the public at large, of the need\nfor safeguards against abuse of its service, appropriate to the nature of the\nservice and the cost and difficulty of such safeguards. In addition, they shall\nincorporate in the tariffs or contracts pursuant to which services are made\navailable to information providers, a requirement that such providers adopt and\napply procedures reasonably designed to provide safeguards against such abuse, including, but not limited to, the provision of information concerning\ncomplaint mechanisms. (c) Availability of blocking. Telephone corporations shall make available, once\ntechnically and economically feasible, facilities giving end-users the ability\nto block (or delegate the blocking of) individual content services. Until such\ntime that such blocking is readily available, it shall be permissible for\ntelephone corporations to designate particular special interest central office\ncodes which can be blocked at the subscriber's request. Inclusion in such\ncentral office codes shall be left to self-selection by the content service\nprovider with independent arbitration and due process protections in the event\nof a dispute. Such special interest central office codes should be treated\nnondiscriminatorily, with respect to terms and conditions of\nservices. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n605.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
