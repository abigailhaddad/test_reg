Each video lottery gaming agent, and each of such agent's\nprincipals, shall establish and maintain during the pendency of such video\ngaming agent license the financial stability of such licensee to the\nsatisfaction of commission. The commission may consider any relevant evidence\nof financial stability. A video lottery gaming agent shall be considered to be\nfinancially stable if such agent establishes by clear and convincing evidence\nthat such agent meets each of the following standards: (1)\n\nEach video lottery gaming agent must\nassure the financial integrity of video lottery gaming operations by the\nmaintenance of a video lottery gaming bankroll, or equivalent provision(s), adequate to pay prizes to video lottery gaming patrons when due. A video\nlottery gaming agent shall be found to have established this standard if it\nmaintains, on a daily basis, a video lottery gaming bankroll, or equivalent\nprovisions, in an amount at least equal to the facility's immediate cash\nrequirement exposure for player prizes. Prior to receiving a certificate of\noperation for the video lottery gaming facility, each video lottery gaming\nagent must submit to the commission a calculation of their video lottery gaming\nbankroll to be maintained at the commencement of each gaming day. Such\ncalculation shall be based upon prize valuation levels. The bankroll will be\nreviewed by the commission, and shall guarantee that the vault funding by\nweekday is at least equal to 200 percent of the projected average daily prize\nclaims at the video lottery gaming facility. Each video lottery gaming agent\nmust continually review and evaluate daily bankroll requirements and notify the\ncommission in writing if it requests to change the amount of the minimum\nbankroll. Such notification must be provided to the commission at least 10 days\nprior to the implementation of the new funding level. Maintenance of a minimum\nbankroll is subject to audit or review by the commission. Failure to maintain\nadequate funding levels consistent with this requirement will be a violation of\nthe video lottery gaming agent's license. (2)\n\nEach video lottery gaming agent must be\nable to pay, as and when due, all local, State and Federal taxes, including the\ntax on gross revenues imposed by the video lottery gaming law, and any costs\nassociated with the licensing process. (3)\nA video lottery gaming agent shall\nmaintain the video lottery gaming facility and related amenities in good\nrepair. Each video lottery gaming agent shall submit annually to the commission\nfor review, any changes or updates to the capital investment plan for the video\nlottery gaming facility together with the then-effective capital investment\nplan. The commission shall review such changes and updates to ensure that each\nvideo lottery gaming agent is investing portions of the vendor fee permitted by\nthe act in the facility's infrastructure as is necessary to support viable and\nsuccessful video lottery gaming in this State. Each capital investment plan\nsubmitted shall be in such form as required by the commission and shall discuss\nthe improvements made to the facility since the submission of the last\ninvestment plan. Each video lottery gaming agent shall budget for repair and\nreplacement reserves to maintain the facility unless otherwise prohibited by\nlaw. The commission reserves the right to require video lottery gaming agents\nto create and fund replacement reserves at such amounts determined by the\ncommission consistent with the requirements of the act. (4)\n\nEach video lottery gaming agent must be\nable to pay, exchange, refinance or extend debts, including long-term and\nshort-term principal and interest and capital lease obligations, that will\nmature or otherwise come due and payable during the license term, or to\notherwise manage such debts and any default with respect to such debts. Each\nvideo lottery gaming agent shall advise the commission of such agent's plans to\nmeet this standard with respect to any material debt(s) coming due and payable\nwithin 12 months after the end of the license term. (5)\n\nNo video lottery gaming agent shall\nconsummate a material debt transaction without the prior written approval of\nthe commission. (6)\n\nNo video\nlottery gaming agent shall guarantee the debt of any person or business entity, whether by co-signature or otherwise, or assume the debt of any person or\nbusiness entity; or enter into any agreement to place any encumbrance on of its\nvideo lottery gaming facility to secure the debts of such video gaming agent, any person or business entity, without the prior written approval of the\ncommission. (b) In\nreviewing any transaction in connection with the financial stability of the\nvideo lottery gaming agent or any of such agent's principals, the commission\nshall consider whether the transaction deprives the agent or person of\nfinancial stability, taking into account the current or projected financial\ncondition of the video lottery gaming agent and such agent's affiliate, and the\npotential impact of any default on the agent or person. (c) Any subsequent use of the proceeds of a\nfinancial transaction previously approved by the commission pursuant to these\nregulations, including subsequent drawings under previously approved\ntransactions, shall not require further commission approval unless such use is\ninconsistent with the use approved by the commission. (d) The commission may restrict or prohibit\nthe transfer of cash to, or the assumption of liabilities on behalf of, an\naffiliate of the video gaming agent if, in the judgment of the commission, such\ntransfer or assumption would deprive the video lottery gaming agent of\nfinancial stability.
