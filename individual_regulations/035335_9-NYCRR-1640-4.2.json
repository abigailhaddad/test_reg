  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-4.2 - Predetermination of eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe standards applied to the determination of the\neligibility, as development costs, of indeterminate expenditures are much\nnarrower than those applied to expenditures made subsequent to the date of the\ncontract for State aid. Such expenditures are not only limited to certain\nclasses, but the maximum amount which may be charged to development cost, whether or not the expenditures are otherwise eligible, may also be limited. Generally speaking, within the maximum limitation set by the division, only\nindeterminate expenditures directly connected with the preparation and\nsubmission of the application for financial assistance, or with a housing\nsurvey to establish the need for and scope of a project will be admitted as\ndevelopment costs eligible to be reimbursed out of loan funds advanced or to be\nadvanced by the State. Generally speaking, salaries of an executive director or\nstaff, office rent, and most other expenses or costs incurred by a local agency\nprior to the beginning of the development period will not be admitted. Local\nagencies are therefore advised to consult with the division before incurring\nindeterminate expenditures in order to predetermine, as far as possible, their\neligibility and to avoid the necessity of making adjustments at a later\ndate. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1640-4.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
