  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 155.20 - Energy performance contracts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The following procedures consistent with\n\nEnergy Law, section 9-103(8), and Education Law, sections 305(27) and\n3602(6)(i)(5)(i)(b) and (c) shall apply to energy performance contracts entered\ninto by a school district or a board of cooperative educational services\n(BOCES) on or after July 1, 1998, provided that this section shall not apply to\nenergy performance contracts for which a request for proposals was entered into\nprior to July 1, 1998. (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section: (1)\n\nEnergy performance contract shall mean an\nagreement for the provision of energy services, including but not limited to\nelectricity, heating, ventilation, cooling, steam or hot water, in which a\nperson agrees to install, maintain or manage energy systems or equipment to\nimprove the energy efficiency of, or produce energy in connection with, a\nbuilding or facility in exchange for a portion of the energy savings or\nrevenues. (2)\n\nSimple payback period\nshall mean a measure of the length of time required for the cumulative cost\nsavings, net of cumulative future costs, from an investment in an energy\nconservation project to pay back the investment cost, without taking into\naccount the time value of money, or the differential energy price escalation\nrate, or the State building aid payable for the project. (3)\n\nEnergy savings shall mean the positive\ndifference between the energy and associated cost before the retrofit and its\nestimated cost after the retrofit of a proposed alternative building system, taking into account all types of energy effected. (4)\n\nCost savings shall mean the positive\ndifference between the operation and maintenance cost before the retrofit and\nits established operation and maintenance cost after the retrofit. (5)\n\nCo-generation shall mean the simultaneous\nproduction of electricity and thermal energy. Typical systems utilize natural\ngas engines to turn electric generators thereby producing electricity, which\nreduces utility costs. Waste heat captured from the natural gas combustion\nprocess can be used to produce domestic hot water, provide space heat in winter\nor air conditioning in summer when used in conjunction with absorption\nchillers. (c) The\nappropriate type of projects that qualify to be completed under an energy\nperformance contract may include, but are not limited to: (1)\nreplacement of lighting\nfixtures; (2)\ninstallation of\nenergy efficient boiler/furnace, heating, ventilating, air conditioning (HVAC)\nequipment; (3)\ninstallation of\nvestibules; (4)\ninstallation of\nautomatic setback thermostat; (5)\nenergy management system; (6)\nupgrade domestic hot water system; (7)\nroof insulation; (8)\ninstallation of energy efficient\nwindow/doors; (9)\nco-generation; or\n(10)\nthe installation, maintenance or management of other energy systems or equipment to improve the\nenergy efficiency of, or produce energy in connection with, a building or\nfacility. (d) Every\nenergy performance contract entered into by a school district or BOCES to which\nthis section applies and every amendment to an energy performance contract\nentered into on or after July 1, 1998 by a board of education or a BOCES shall\nbe subject to approval by the Commissioner of Education and shall contain a\nprovision that such contract shall not be executory until approval of the\ncommissioner is obtained. In order to obtain approval by the Commissioner of\n\nEducation to enter into an energy performance contract, the school district or\nBOCES shall: (1)\ndemonstrate that the project\ncomplies with all applicable provisions of section\n155.2\nof this Part; (2)\ndescribe the scope and nature of the work\nto be performed; (3)\ndemonstrate\nthat the types of projects included in the energy performance contract are\nappropriate in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section; (4)\nprovide a detailed breakdown of the\nenergy performance savings to be derived each year and for the duration of the\nenergy performance contract in the project summary form, which shall include: (i) a description of each energy conservation\nmeasure included in the energy performance contract; (ii)\nthe cost of each energy conservation\nmeasure; (iii)\nthe project energy\nsavings and cost savings; (iv)\nthe\nuseful life of each energy conservation measure; and\n(v) the simple payback period; (5)\nstate any maintenance and\nmonitoring charges that are part of the energy performance contract in a clear\nand conspicuous manner separately in the contract; (6)\nprovide the interest rate applicable to\nthe energy performance contract and length of borrowing. The interest rate will\nbe compared to the U.S. Treasury rate for like terms as published in the Wall\n\nStreet Journal and must be comparable; (7)\nprovide the following certifications: (i) the sole trustee, the president of the\nboard of trustees or board of education, or the president of the BOCES shall\ncertify that in lieu of competitive bidding, the energy performance contract\nwas procured pursuant to a request for proposal (RFP) process in accordance\nwith the school district's or BOCES' procurement policies and procedures\nadopted pursuant to applicable provisions of General Municipal Law, section\n104-b; (ii)\nthe energy performance\ncontractor shall certify that such energy performance contractor has guaranteed\nrecovery of contract costs from energy savings realized by the school district\nduring the term of the energy performance contract, which shall not exceed 18\nyears, or the useful life of the equipment being installed, whichever is less. This certification shall be based on an analysis of energy costs and savings, which shall not include any cost savings attributable to State building aid. If\na simple payback calculation is used to demonstrate compliance with the 18 year\npayback limitation, it shall be calculated by dividing the initial contract\ncost by the first year cost savings. If another analysis is used to support the\ncertification, it should be submitted with the certification; (iii)\nthe energy performance contractor shall\ncertify that measurement and verification techniques for determining cost\nsavings will be performed in accordance with the North American Energy\n\nMeasurement and Verification Protocol, March 1996 (U.S. Department of Energy, Washington, DC 20585: available at the Office of Facilities Planning, Room\n1060, State Education Building Annex, Albany, NY 12234); (iv)\nthe energy performance contractor shall\ncertify that any State building aid attributable to such project has been\nexcluded in determining the cost savings and payback period under the energy\nperformance contract; and\n(v) the\narchitect and/or engineer of record shall certify that he or she is free from\nfinancial interest in the energy performance contractor which conflicts with\nthe proper completion of the audit and any design work associated with the\nenergy performance contract and that full disclosure has been made to the\nschool district and/or BOCES detailing all financial compensation received from\nthe energy performance contractor. (e) The administrative and technical review\nby the State Education Department shall include: (1)\nreview of project scope and its\nappropriateness to be done under an energy performance contract and its\neligibility for building aid; (2)\nreview of the project's compliance with applicable provisions of section\n155.2\nof this Part; (3)\nreview of detailed breakdown of the\nenergy savings to ensure compliance with Education Law, section\n3602(6)(i)(5)(i); (4)\nreview of\ncertifications by the president of the board of education, energy performance\ncontractor and architect/engineer as specified in regulations; (5)\nreview of interest rate and comparison to\nthe U.S. Treasury rate for like terms; and\n(6)\nreview of technical specifications for\ncompliance with the Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code, State Education\n\nDepartment standards and other applicable standards. (f) Capital construction costs and associated\nincidental costs such as architect/engineer fees, administrative costs and\nfeasibility costs may be eligible for building aid. Costs associated with\noperation and maintenance, repairs, extended warranties and service agreements\nare not eligible for building aid and should be separated in a clear and\nconspicuous manner from those eligible expenses.
