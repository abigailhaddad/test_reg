  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 9-3.3 - Examples\n\nState Regulations\n\nExample 1: Corporation A is a New York S corporation that\nhas the following types of receipts: * dividends from stock of unitary corporations (that\nwould have been characterized as other exempt income for a New York C\ncorporation); * dividends from stock of non-unitary corporations (that\nwould have been characterized as investment income for a New York C\ncorporation); * net gains from sales of stock of non-unitary\ncorporations (that would have been characterized as investment income for a New\n\nYork C corporation); * interest from loans secured by real property; * interest from corporate bonds; and\n* net gains from sales of corporate bonds. Corporation A marks to market stock of non-unitary\ncorporations only. No other assets are marked to market. All of these receipts are considered business receipts\nfor Corporation A. The amount of such receipts included in Corporation A's New\n\nYork receipts or everywhere receipts is determined in accordance with section\n9-3.1\nof this Subchapter. Corporation A did not make the fixed percentage election. Therefore, dividends and net gains from stock are not included in its New York\nreceipts or everywhere receipts pursuant to section 210-A.5(a)(2)(G) and the\namount of interest from loans secured by real property, interest from corporate\nbonds, and net gains from the sale of corporate bonds included in New York\nreceipts or everywhere receipts is determined in accordance with section\n210-A.5(a)(2) and this Subchapter. To determine the amounts derived from New York sources\nfor purposes of article 22, nonresident shareholder X of Corporation A must\nmultiply its pro-rata share of Corporation A's items of income, gain, loss, and\ndeduction that are included in shareholder X's New York adjusted gross income, including all income, gain, and loss from Corporation A's stocks, loans, and\ncorporate bonds by Corporation A's apportionment factor. Example 2: Same facts as Example 1 except that\n\nCorporation A makes the fixed percentage election. Since one stock has been\nmarked to market, all stock are qualified financial instruments. The result is\nthat 8% of the dividends and net gains (not less than zero) from stocks are\nincluded in Corporation A's New York receipts and 100% of dividends and net\ngains (not less than zero) from stock are included in everywhere receipts. The\nloans and corporate bonds are not qualified financial instruments as none of\nthese assets have been marked to market. The amount of interest from the loans\nsecured by real property, interest from corporate bonds, and net gains from the\nsales of corporate bonds included in New York receipts or everywhere receipts\nis determined in accordance with section 210-A and this Subchapter To determine\nthe amounts derived from New York sources for purposes of article 22, nonresident shareholder X of Corporation A must multiply its pro-rata share of\n\nCorporation A's items of income, gain, loss, and deduction that are included in\nshareholder X's New York adjusted gross income, including all income, gain, and\nloss from Corporation A's stock, loans, and corporate bonds by Corporation A's\napportionment factor.
