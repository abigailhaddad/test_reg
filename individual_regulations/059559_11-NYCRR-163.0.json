  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 163.0 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n\nOn June 30, 2008, the Governor signed chapter 136 of the Laws of 2008 into law to enhance competition in the nonbusiness motor vehicle market, by adding a new Insurance Law section 2350. Chapter 136 replaces the prior approval system, in effect since 2001 for nonbusiness motor vehicle insurance rates, with a flexible rating (flex-rating) system. The new system, which takes effect on January 1, 2009, is a blend of prior approval and competitive rating. The system allows periodic overall average rate changes up to five percent on a file and use basis, and requires the superintendent's prior approval of overall average rate increases above five percent in any twelve-month period. The new section 2350 requires the superintendent to promulgate rules and regulations implementing the new flex-rating system. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n163.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
