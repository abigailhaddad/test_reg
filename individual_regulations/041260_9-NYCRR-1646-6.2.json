  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-6.2 - Procedure prior to initial operating period\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Tenants selection costs. (1)\n\nAs a matter of prudent business policy, most local agencies will undertake the screening of applicants for admission to\nthe project proper in advance of the date the first buildings become available\nfor occupancy. The receiving, processing, and investigation of applications\nthus begun prior to the initial operating period, will ordinarily continue well\ninto the initial operating period. Tenant selection costs, whether incurred\nprior to or during the initial operating period, do not constitute an expense\nof the initial operating period. They are charged directly to account 1470.1, Tenant Selection Costs, and are paid out of the development fund. (2)\n\nWith respect to the question of what\nconstitutes tenant selection costs, local agencies should be guided by the\nprinciple that account 1470.1 Tenant Selection Costs, should be charged only\nwith such costs as are readily identifiable with tenant selection and which\nwould not have been incurred if tenant selection had not been undertaken. Only\nthe salaries, for example, of personnel especially employed for tenant\nselection shall be charged to account 1470.1. Where local agency personnel\nperform tenant selection work incidental to other duties, no allocation of\nsalaries need be made, etc. (b) Preliminary expenses. Prudent policy, again, would demand that a local agency, in addition to beginning the screening\nof applications in advance of the date the first buildings of the project\nproper become available for occupancy, make preparations, in advance of such\ndate, for receiving the tenants. Such preparations might include the printing\nof booklets for the instruction of tenants, the recruiting of the management\nand maintenance staffs, the employment of such staffs for a short training and\norientation period, etc. It may sometimes be found necessary, also, to furnish\noperating services and utilities, etc., for a short period between the date of\nacceptance of the first buildings by the local agency and the beginning of the\ninitial operating period. Such costs and expenses (other than tenant selection\ncosts) as are directly attributable to the preparations for the operation of a\nproject or to the initial operation of the project proper, and which have been\nincurred or are applicable to the period prior to the beginning of the initial\noperating period, constitute preliminary expenses which are charged to account\n1470.2 and are payable out of the development fund directly. They do not\nconstitute expenses of the initial operating period chargeable to account\n1470.3. (c) Administration fund\nbank account. Prior to the date the first rentals from the project proper are\nexpected to be received, the local agency shall open an administration fund\nbank account. Procedures for opening bank accounts are described in Part 1642. All income derived from the operation of the project proper during the initial\noperating period shall be deposited into the administration fund, and all\nexpenses chargeable to the operating period accounts (4000 group) shall be paid\nout of the administration fund. In the event funds are not available for the\npayment of such expenses out of the administration fund, transfers may be made\nfrom the development fund to the administration fund, as described in\nsubdivision (d) of section\n1646-6.3. The administration fund\nbank account so established is continued beyond the date of substantial\ncompletion into the operating period. (d) Security deposits fund bank account. Simultaneously with opening the administration fund bank account, the local\nagency should open a security deposits fund bank account, so that the required\nsegregation of security deposits from other funds may be\naccomplished. (e) Subsidiary income\nand expense analysis ledgers. Prior to the beginning of the initial operating\nperiod, the local agency shall set up, and have ready for use, subsidiary\nincome and expense analysis ledgers prescribed for the recording of the income\nand expense of the project proper during the initial operating period, in\naccordance with the instructions contained in the definition of account 1470.3\n(see Part 1641) and in Part 1642. The use of account 1470.3, Net Deficit or\n(Income), for the control of the subsidiary ledgers is described in sections\n1642-3.8 and\n1642-3.9. (f) Tenant accounting system. Prior to the\ninitial operating period the tenant accounting system including the subsidiary\nsecurity deposits ledger should be set up and ready for use. Such preparation\nshould be timely, inasmuch as the preparation and printing of the forms\nrequired for the system, the setting up of the control records, instruction of\nthe staff in the operation of the system, etc., may extend over a period of\nsome months. In addition, where machine-bookkeeping is to be used, the order\nfor the machine may have to be placed well in advance. A specimen tenant\naccounting system for hand posting is described in Part 1642. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1646-6.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
