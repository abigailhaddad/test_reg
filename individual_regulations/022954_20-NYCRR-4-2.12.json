  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-2.12 - Interest income, net gains, and other income from other financial instruments\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A(5)(a)(2)(H))\n(a) Interest income, net gains (not less than\nzero), and other income (not less than zero) from other financial instruments\nincludes interest income, net gains, and other income from financial\ninstruments that are not described in the rules for section\n210-A(5)(a)(2)(A)-(G), (I), and (J) and the regulations in this\n\nSubchapter. (b) Interest income\nfrom other financial instruments includes, but is not limited to, interest\nincome on: (1)\ndeposit accounts; (2)\nmoney market accounts; (3)\ndebt issued by a country, or political\nsubdivision thereof, other than the United States; and\n(4)\nreserves maintained with the Federal\n\nReserve. (c) Interest\nincome from other financial instruments is included in New York receipts if the\npayor is located in New York State. 100% of such interest income is included in\neverywhere receipts. (1)\n\nFor purposes of this\nsection, an individual, as payor or purchaser, is located in New York State if\nits billing address is in New York State; and a business entity, as payor or\npurchaser, is located in New York State if its commercial domicile is in New\n\nYork State. (2)\n\nThe location for a\ngovernment entity, as payor or purchaser, is dependent on the type of\ngovernment entity. For example, when the payor is a foreign country, the payor\nwould be wholly located outside of New York State, and when the payor is part\nof a federal banking system that operates multiple banks throughout the United\n\nStates, the payor would be located in New York State to the extent of the\npercentage of banks in New York State. (d) (1)\n\nFor\neach sale of a financial instrument apportioned under this section, the\ncorporation shall compute a gain or loss from the sale by subtracting the\nadjusted basis in such financial instrument from the sale price of such\nfinancial instrument. If the sale price exceeds the adjusted basis, the result\nis a gain. If the sale price is less than the adjusted basis, the result is a\nloss. (2)\n\nTo determine the amount\nof net gains from sales of each type of financial instrument apportioned under\nthis section, the gains from sales of a type of other financial instrument are\nreduced by the losses from sales of that same type of other financial\ninstrument, provided the result cannot be less than zero. If the result is\nequal to or less than zero, no amount is included in New York receipts and\neverywhere receipts. The computation is done for each type of instrument so\nthat gains from one type of financial instrument cannot offset losses from\nanother type of financial instrument. (3)\n(i) The\namount of net gains (not less than zero) from sales of a type of other\nfinancial instrument included in New York receipts is the product of net gains\nfrom the sales of that type of other financial instrument and a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is gross proceeds from sales of that type of financial\ninstrument to purchasers located within New York State and the denominator of\nwhich is gross proceeds from sales of that type of financial instrument to\npurchasers located within and without New York State. Net gains (not less than\nzero) from the sale of that type of other financial instrument is included in\neverywhere receipts. (ii)\n\nGross\nproceeds shall be determined after the deduction of transactional costs\nincurred to acquire the financial instrument, but shall not be less than zero. The transactional costs incurred to acquire the financial instrument shall not\ninclude the corporation's adjusted basis. (e) Other income (not less than zero) from\nother financial instruments includes, but is not limited to, substitute\npayments in lieu of dividends and income received from stock of the Federal\nreserve bank. (f) Examples. Example 1: Taxpayer A earns $2,000,000 of interest income\non deposits on accounts at the New York State branch and the State X branch of\na bank whose commercial domicile is located in State Y. No interest income is\nincluded in New York receipts because the commercial domicile of the bank is\n\nState Y. The $2,000,000 of interest income is included in everywhere\nreceipts. Example 2: Taxpayer B receives $1,500 of income from\n\nMoney Market Fund M. The commercial domicile of Money Market Fund M is State X. No interest income is included in New York receipts because the commercial\ndomicile of Money Market Fund M is in State X. The $1,500 of income is included\nin everywhere receipts. Example 3: Taxpayer C maintains reserves at its required\n\nFederal Reserve Bank. These funds generate $1,000 of interest income that is\nnot considered interest income from Federal funds. Only one of the twelve\n\nFederal Reserve Banks is located in New York. As a result, 1/12 of the interest\nincome is included in New York receipts. All $1,000 of interest income is\nincluded in everywhere receipts. Example 4: As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank\n(FHLBank), Taxpayer D is required to invest in the FHLBank. During the taxable\nyear, Taxpayer D receives $10,000 of income from this investment. Only one of\nthe eleven Federal Home Loan Banks is located in New York. As a result, while\n$10,000 is included in everywhere receipts, only 1/11 of the that amount, or\n$909, is included in New York receipts. Example 5: Taxpayer E receives $2,000 of substitute\npayments in lieu of dividends from its stock of Corporation X, domiciled in\nstate Y. No substitute payments in lieu of dividends are included in New York\nreceipts because the payor, Corporation X, is domiciled in State Y. All $2,000\nof such payments are included in everywhere receipts. Example 6: Taxpayer F owns debt issued by Country X, debt\nissued by Country Y, debt issued by Country Z, foreign currency swaps for the\ncurrency A, and foreign currency swaps for currency B. Taxpayer F has two types\nof other financial instruments \" debt issued by other countries and foreign\ncurrency swaps. Any gains from sales of debt issued by other countries may be\nreduced only by losses from sales of debt issued by other countries and any\ngains from sales of foreign currency swaps may be reduced only by losses from\nsales of foreign currency swaps.
