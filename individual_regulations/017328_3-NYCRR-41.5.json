  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 41.5 - Unfair and deceptive acts or practices\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following acts shall be prima facie evidence that the\nlender does not possess the requisite character and fitness required to be\nlicensed or registered by the New York State Banking Department: (a) the making of high cost home loans that\ndemonstrate a pattern and practice of violating any provision of this Part. The\nprovisions of this section shall apply to any lender that seeks to avoid its\napplication by any device, subterfuge or pretense whatsoever, which shall\ninclude but not be limited to splitting or dividing any loan transaction into\nseparate parts for the purpose of evading the provisions of this Part and\nsection\n6-l\nof the Banking\n\nLaw; (b) engaging in unfair, deceptive or unconscionable practices in the course of advertising, brokering\nor making high cost home loans to residents of this State. Such practices\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following: (1)\nbrokering or making a high cost home loan\nwhich includes points, fees or other finance charges that, considering the loan\ntransaction as a whole (including the creditworthiness of the borrower, the\nterms of the loan, the value of the collateral, and the owner's equity in the\ncollateral), so significantly exceed the usual and customary charges incurred\nby mortgage consumers generally in this State for such points, fees or other\nfinance charges as to be unconscionable; (2)\nbrokering or making high cost home loans\nin which the broker or lender charges and retains fees in any manner or form: (i) for services that are not actually\nperformed; (ii)\nfor which the fees\nbear no reasonable relationship to the value of the services actually\nperformed; or\n(iii)\nwhich are\notherwise unconscionable; (3)\nbrokering or making high cost home loans\nwith repayment terms that so exceed the borrower's financial capacity to repay\nas to be unconscionable. A loan that complies with section\n41.3\n(b) of this\n\nPart shall be presumed not to violate this paragraph. Evidence that the\nrepayment terms exceed the borrower's reasonable capacity to repay may be\nrebutted by: (i) a showing that the lender\nreasonably believed at the time the loan was consummated that the borrower and\nany obligor had the capacity to repay the loan based upon consideration of\ntheir current and expected income, current obligations, employment status, and\nother financial resources, excluding the owner's equity in the dwelling that\nsecures repayment of the loan and including any other collateral securing\nrepayment of the loan; or\n(ii)\na\nshowing that other compelling circumstances existed that justified the making\nof the loan notwithstanding the borrower's apparent lack of capacity to repay\nthe loan based upon the factors stated in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph; (4)\n\"flipping\" high cost home loans; that is, brokering or making a high cost home\nloan to a borrower that refinances an existing mortgage loan when, considering\nall the circumstances of the refinancing, such refinancing does not have a\ntangible net benefit to the borrower. A lender shall be considered by the\nsuperintendent to have provided a tangible net benefit to the borrower if a\nhigh cost home loan meets the following criteria: the borrower receives a\nmonetary benefit, such as receipt of additional proceeds, a reduction of the\noutstanding mortgage debt, a lowering of the annual percentage rate, and/or a\nlowering of the monthly payments of principal and interest, taking into\nconsideration the totality of the circumstances, including, but not limited to, the amount of the monetary benefit, the loan product and the borrower's\nrepayment ability, current and expected income and current obligations; provided, however, that if the monthly payment of principal and interest and/or\nthe mortgage debt increases, a commensurate monetary benefit shall ensue to the\nborrower; (5)\n\"packing\" high cost\nhome loans; that is, the practice of selling credit life, accident and health, disability, property, or unemployment insurance products, any other life or\nhealth insurance product, debt cancellation or suspension agreement products, or unrelated goods or services in conjunction with a high cost home loan\nwithout the informed consent of the borrower under circumstances where: (i) the broker or lender solicits the sale of\nsuch products, goods or services; and\n(ii)\nthe broker or lender receives direct or\nindirect compensation for the sale of such products, goods or services; provided, however, it shall not constitute the practice of\n\"packing\" if the broker or lender, at least 10 business days before the loan is\nclosed whether or not funds are then disbursed, makes a separate oral and a\nseparate clear and conspicuous written disclosure in at least 12-point type to\nthe borrower containing the following information: the cost of such products or\nother goods and services; the fact that such products, goods, or services, as\noffered to the borrower by the broker or lender, will be either prepaid or\ncalculated, earned, and paid on a monthly or other regular, periodic basis; and\nthat the purchase of such products, goods or services is not required to obtain\nthe mortgage loan. In addition, the written disclosure shall contain a signed\nand dated acknowledgment by the borrower(s) that the oral disclosure was made\nand a signed and dated acknowledgment by the broker or lender that the oral\ndisclosure was made; (6)\nrecommending or encouraging default or\nfurther default by a borrower on an existing loan or other debt, prior to and\nin connection with the closing or planned closing of a high cost home loan that\nrefinances all or any portion of such existing loan or debt; or\n(7)\nadvertising that refinancing pre-existing\ndebt with a high cost home loan will reduce a borrower's aggregate monthly debt\npayment without also disclosing, if such are likely the case, that the high\ncost home loan will increase both: (i) a\nborrower's aggregate number of monthly debt payments; and\n(ii)\nthe aggregate amount paid by a borrower\nover the term of the high cost mortgage loan.
