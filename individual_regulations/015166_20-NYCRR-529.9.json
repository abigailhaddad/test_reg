(2)\n\nIn\norder to exercise its right to exemption, the Indian nation or tribe must be\nthe direct purchaser, occupant or patron of record. It must be the direct payer\nof record and must furnish its vendors with a properly completed exempt\norganization certification. Direct purchaser, occupant or patron of\nrecord\nas used in this paragraph includes any agent authorized by the\n\nIndian nation or tribe to act on its behalf in making such purchases, provided\nthe Indian nation or tribe and its agent are both identified on any bill or\ninvoice. An Indian nation or tribe is the direct payer of record where direct\npayment is made by the Indian nation or tribe, or from its funds directly to\nthe vendor. (3)\n\nAn exempt\norganization certification is deemed to be properly completed when it contains\nthe: (i) name and address of the\nvendor; (ii)\nname and address of\nthe exempt Indian nation or tribe; (iii)\nnumber assigned to the exempt Indian\nnation or tribe on the exempt organization certificate; (iv)\nsignature of a responsible officer of\nthe exempt Indian nation or tribe; and\n(v) date the certification was\nexecuted. (4)\n\nMembers, officers or employees of an exempt Indian nation or tribe may not use the\nexempt certificate issued for the nation or tribe to make tax-exempt purchases\nfor their personal use. See subparagraph (d)(2)(i) of this section for\ncertificates of sales tax exemption for sales on reservations to resident\n\nIndians. (d) Sales by exempt Indian nations or tribes. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in section\n1116\nof the Tax Law or other law, sales of\ntangible personal property and services by exempt Indian nations or tribes are\nexempt from the sales and use tax. (2)\n(i) Retail sales of tangible personal property made through a shop or store\noperated by an exempt Indian nation or tribe, other than sales made or\ndelivered to an Indian on the reservation where he resides, are subject to the\nsales and use tax. To claim exemption, a certificate of sales tax exemption for\nsales on reservations to resident Indians must be properly completed and given\nto each vendor at the time of the first purchase from that vendor. A separate\ncertificate is not necessary for each subsequent purchase, provided the\naforementioned conditions are met and the Indian's name and address appear on\nthe sales slip or billing invoice. (ii)\nA\nshop or store\nas used\nin this section includes any place or establishment where goods are sold from\ndisplay with a degree of regularity, frequency and continuity, as well as any\nplace where sales are made through a temporary shop or store located on the\nsame premises as persons required to collect tax. Example 1: An Indian nation maintains a shop on its reservation which\nsells cigarettes, candy, gum and soda. The sales of these items are taxable, except when they are sold to an Indian who resides on the\nreservation. (iii)\n\nIf an\nexempt Indian nation or tribe operates a shop or store and also makes retail\nsales of similar (though not necessarily identical) items of tangible personal\nproperty by any means other than at its shop or store (such as by remote means\nor at an auction), those additional sales are considered to be made from its\nshop or store. (iv)\n\nNotwithstanding\nany other provision of this paragraph and except as provided by law, all of the\nprovisions of section\n529.7\n(i)(2)\nof this Part apply to sales of tangible personal property and services by an\nexempt Indian nation or tribe. (3)\n\nSales of food and drink in or by a\nrestaurant, tavern or other establishment operated by an exempt Indian nation\nor tribe, other than the sales exempt under section\n1105 (d)(ii)\nof the Tax Law\ndescribed in subdivision (h) of section\n527.8\nof\nthis Title, are subject to the sales tax, unless the sale is to a person or\norganization exempt under this Part, including sales made or delivered to an\n\nIndian on the reservation where he resides. A\nrestaurant, tavern or\nother establishment\nas used in this section includes any dining room, bar and barroom, and concession stand operated with a degree of regularity, frequency and continuity, as well as any place where sales are made through a\ntemporary restaurant located on the same premises as persons required to\ncollect tax. It is immaterial whether or not the restaurant, tavern or other\nestablishment is located on the premises of the Indian nation or tribe, or\nwhether or not the use of such facilities is restricted to the members of the\ntribe. (See section\n527.8\nof\nthis Title for the application of tax on sales of food and drink.)\n(4)\n\nAn exempt Indian nation or tribe making\ntaxable sales is required to register as a vendor, collect the appropriate tax, and file timely sales tax returns. (5)\n\nFailure by an Indian nation or tribe to\ncollect tax on transactions which are subject to tax does not relieve the\npurchaser from his liability to pay the tax due. The tax due and not collected\nmust be paid by the purchaser directly to the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. (See Part 532 of this Title.)\n\nCross-reference: For the application of tax on admissions, see section\n527.10\nof this\n\nTitle. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
