  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 79.6 - Maintenance of real property securing reverse mortgage loans\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Mortgagor shall\nbe required to maintain the real property securing the reverse mortgage loan in\na reasonably similar condition, state and repair as the property is in at the\ntime of closing or after repairs have been made for which funds have been\ndisbursed or set aside at closing for later disbursement and that the mortgagor\nagreed to make as a condition of the closing of the loan. For purposes of this\nsection, the term \"reasonably similar condition, state and repair\" is relevant\nonly to the extent that such condition, state or repair threatens to materially\ndamage the property or its market value. (b) If the mortgagor fails to maintain the\nreal property securing the reverse mortgage loan in accordance with subsection\n(a) the mortgagee may arrange for such maintenance upon receiving consent to\nenter upon the premises, which is not to be unreasonably withheld by the\nmortgagor. Notwithstanding applicable state and federal rules and laws, a\nmortgagee may pay for maintenance work done in accordance with this section in\nthe following ways: (1)\nby deducting\nnecessary amounts from a set aside account; (2)\nby withholding from one or more monthly\npayments otherwise due to the mortgagor no more than 25 percent of each such\nmonthly payment, until the repairs are paid for; or\n(3)\nby adding the amount to the loan\nprincipal. If a set aside account has been established, then, to the\nextent possible, the mortgagee must deduct the cost of the repair from such\nfund before choosing option (2) or (3) of this subdivision. If a set aside\naccount has not been established, then the mortgagee may choose whether to\nproceed according to option (2) or (3) of this subdivision or a combination\nthereof. (c) The\nmortgagee shall notify the mortgagor or authorized designee of the need for\nmaintenance and, unless an imminent threat of material damage to the property\nor its market value exists, provide the mortgagor 90 calendar days before\narranging for such maintenance. If an imminent danger to life or property\nexists, the mortgagee may proceed on as little as 48 hours' notice to the\nmortgagor. (d) The mortgagee shall\nhave the right to inspect the real property securing the loan on 72 hours'\nnotice but not more often than is reasonably necessary to assure the real\nproperty securing the reverse mortgage loan is being maintained in a reasonably\nsimilar condition, state and repair as the property was in at the time of\nclosing or after repairs have been made for which funds have been disbursed or\nset aside at closing for later disbursement and that the mortgagor agreed to\nmake as a condition of the closing of the loan. (e) Mortgagees must have written policies and\nprocedures in place to allow for the appeal of any determination made in\naccordance with this section. Such policies and procedures must be made\navailable to the mortgagor upon request. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
