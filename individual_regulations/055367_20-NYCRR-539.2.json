  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 539.2 - First time registrants\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except for\npersons who are vendors solely by reason of paragraph (5), (6) or (7) of\nsubdivision (a) of section\n526.10\nof this Title, any person\nrequired to register under section\n1134\nof the Tax Law and Part 533 of this\n\nTitle, must submit a certificate of registration at least 20 days before the\nearliest of: (1)\ncommencing\nbusiness; (2)\nopening a new place\nof business; or\n(3)\ntaking\npossession of, or making payment for, business assets transferred in a bulk\nsale. A business is commenced or a new place of business is\nopened when sales are made to customers, rent is received for hotel\noccupancies, or amusement charges are received from patrons. A certificate of\nregistration must be filed at least 20 days before such date, but may be filed\nearlier. Persons intending to make sales to others may wish to file earlier, so\nthat they may be issued a certificate of authority which will authorize the\npurchase of their inventory without payment of tax. (b) If more than one place of business is\nmaintained, a certificate of registration must be filed for the principal place\nof business together with a schedule of business locations for each additional\nplace of business making sales within New York State. A certificate of\nauthority will be issued for each additional business location. Each\ncertificate of authority shall state the place of business (normally, the\naddress) to which it is applicable. (c) (1)\n\nAny\nperson who is a vendor solely by reason of section\n526.10\n(a)(5)\nof\nthis Title, must submit a certificate of registration within 30 days after the\nfirst day of the quarterly sales tax reporting period, which period immediately\nfollows the four consecutive quarterly sales tax reporting periods during which\nthe cumulative total number of occasions such person came into the State to\ndeliver property or services exceeded 12. (Quarterly sales tax reporting\nperiods end on the last day of February, May, August and November.) However, in\naccordance with section\n1131 (1)\nof the Tax Law, such registrant shall not be a\n\"person required to collect tax\" until 20 days after the date such registrant\nis required to submit its registration certificate. (2)\n\nAccordingly, a person who first qualifies\nas a vendor solely by reason of section\n516.10(a)(5) of\nthis Title on: (i) December 1st, must submit a\ncertificate of registration no later than December 31st, and shall be a \"person\nrequired to collect tax\" on January 20th, of the next year; (ii)\n\nMarch 1st, must submit a certificate of\nregistration no later than March 31st, and shall be a \"person required to\ncollect tax\" on April 20th; (iii)\n\nJune 1st, must submit a certificate of registration no later than July 1st, and\nshall be a \"person required to collect tax\" on July 21st; (iv)\n\nSeptember 1st, must submit a certificate\nof registration no later than October 1st and shall be a \"person required to\ncollect tax\" on October 21st. Example: A furniture reupholsterer located in New Jersey offers free\npick-up and delivery service to its customers. Between May 15, 1989 and June 5, 1990, the reupholsterer came into New York to deliver furniture, reupholstered\nat its New Jersey factory, on 16 occasions as follows: Job No. Delivery Date\n\nJob No. Delivery Date\n1\n\nMay 15, 1989\n9\n\nSeptember 5, 1989\n2\n\nMay 15, 1989\n10\n\nSeptember 15, 1989\n3\n\nMay 19, 1989\n11\n\nOctober 5, 1989\n4\n\nMay 22, 1989\n12\n\nOctober 13, 1989\n5\n\nJune 5,1989\n13\n\nNovember 27, 1989\n6\n\nJuly 11, 1989\n14\n\nMay 10, 1990\n7\n\nAugust 11, 1989\n15\n\nMay 11, 1990\n8\n\nAugust 28, 1989\n16\n\nJune 5, 1990\n\nSince, as of December 1, 1989, the number of occasions the\nreupholsterer came into New York to deliver its service during the immediately\npreceding four quarterly sales tax reporting periods exceeded 12, the\nreupholsterer is a vendor as of December 1, 1989. Therefore, the reupholsterer\nmust submit a certificate of registration by December 31, 1989, and in\naccordance with section\n1311 (1)\nof the Tax Law, the reupholsterer will be\nrequired to collect tax on all taxable services delivered in New York on or\nafter January 20, 1990. (d) (1)\n\nAny\nperson who is a vendor solely by reason of section\n526.10\n(a)(6)\nof\nthis Title, must submit a certificate of registration within 30 days after the\nfirst day of the quarterly sales tax reporting period, which period immediately\nfollows the four consecutive quarterly sales tax reporting periods during which\nthe cumulative total of such person's gross receipts from sales of property\ndelivered in this State exceeded $300,000 and the number of such sales exceeded\n100. (Quarterly sales tax reporting periods end on the last day of February, May, August and November.) However, in accordance with section\n1131 (1)\nof the\n\nTax Law, such registrant shall not be a \"person required to collect tax\" until\n20 days after the date such registrant is required to submit its registration\ncertificate. (2)\n\nAccordingly, a\nperson who first qualifies as a vendor solely by reason of section\n526.10\n(a)(6)\nof\nthis Title on: (i) December 1st, must submit a\ncertificate of registration no later than December 31st, and shall be a \"person\nrequired to collect tax\" on January 20th, of the next year; (ii)\n\nMarch 1st, must submit a certificate of\nregistration no later than March 31, and shall be a \"person required to collect\ntax\" on April 20th; (iii)\n\nJune 1st, must submit a certificate of registration no later than July 1st, and shall be\na \"person required to collect tax\" on July 21st; (iv)\n\nSeptember 1st, must submit a certificate\nof registration no later than October 1st and shall be a \"person required to\ncollect tax\" on October 21st. Example: Company P, a mail order house located in Utah, solicits\nsales in New York State only by way of its mail order catalog sent four times a\nyear directly to resident addresses in New York. All orders are filled in Utah\nand sent via U.S. mail to New York. Company P began soliciting business in New\n\nYork in September 1989 and during the period September 1, 1989 through November\n30, 1990, Company P had the following gross sales (summarized by sales tax\nquarterly filing period) to customers in New York. Gross Sales in New\n\nYork\n\nPeriod\n\nNumber of\n\nSales\n\nDollar\n\nAmount\n9/1/89 - 11/30/89\n700\n$ 42,000\n12/1/89 - 2/28/90\n1,300\n$ 71,000\n3/1/90 - 5/31/90\n1,500\n$ 81,000\n6/1/90 - 8/31/90\n1,800\n$ 97,000\n9/1/90 - 11/30/90\n2,200\n$114,000\n\nAlthough Company P's number of sales of property delivered\nin New York exceeded 100 during the four quarterly sales tax reporting periods\nfrom September 1, 1989 through August 31, 1990, its dollar volume of sales for\nthis period was only $291,000. Accordingly, Company P is not presumed to be a\nvendor for the quarter beginning September 1, 1990. However, since Company P's\nnumber of sales delivered in New York for the period from December 1, 1989\nthrough November 30, 1990 exceeded 100 and the gross receipts from these sales\nexceeded $300,000, Company P is presumed to be a vendor as of December 1, 1990. Therefore, Company P must submit a certificate of registration by December 31, 1990, and, in accordance with section\n1131 (1)\nof the Tax Law, Company P is\nrequired to collect tax on all taxable sales made on or after January 20, 1991. (e) (1)\n\nAny\nperson who has filed a certificate of registration and obtained a certificate\nof authority solely by reason of having made regular or systematic deliveries\nof property and/or services in this State as described in section\n526.10\n(a)(5)\nof\nthis Title, who can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that he\ncannot reasonably be expected to effect such deliveries of property and/or\nservices on more than 12 occasions during the next succeeding four quarterly\nsales tax reporting periods, may submit a written request to the commissioner\nfor the cancellation of its certificate of authority.

(ii)\n\nThe request for cancellation of the vendor's certificate of authority must be\nfiled with the Registration and Licensing Services Bureau of the Processing\n\nDivision, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227 and must be signed by a\nresponsible owner, partner or officer.

Example: Corporation A, located in New Jersey, has two stores. Store\n\nNo. 1 is in southern New Jersey and Store No. 2 is situated close to the New\n\nYork City metropolitan area. During the period September 1, 1988 through August\n31, 1989, Store No. 2 regularly delivered taxable property into New York within\nthe meaning of section\n526.10\n(a)(5)\nof\nthe Sales and Use Tax Regulations. Corporation A filed a certificate of\nregistration with the Tax Department and holds a valid certificate of\nauthority. On July 1, 1990 Corporation A decided to close Store No. 2\neffective August 31, 1990. Corporation A wrote a letter to the Registration and\n\nLicensing Services Bureau and requested that its certificate of authority be\ncancelled because it had closed its only store doing business in New York. Corporation A included with its letter a certified copy of the resolution of\nthe board of directors of Corporation A closing Store No. 2. On the basis of\nthe submission made by Corporation A, written notification was sent to it by\nthe Registration and Licensing Services Bureau of the effective date of the\ncancellation of its certificate of authority. Within 20 days after the\neffective date of the cancellation of its certificate of authority, Corporation\nA filed its final return and with it submitted payment of all taxes due as well\nas its certificate of authority. (f) (1)\n\nAny\nperson who has filed a certificate of registration and obtained a certificate\nof authority solely by reason of having regularly or systematically solicited\nbusiness in this State as described in section\n526.10\n(a)(6)\nof\nthis Title who can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commissioner that he\ncannot reasonably be expected to have gross receipts in excess of $300,000 or\nmore than 100 sales of property delivered into New York over the next\nsucceeding four quarterly sales tax reporting periods, may submit a written\nrequest to the Commissioner for the cancellation of its certificate of\nauthority.

(ii)\n\nThe request for cancellation of the\nvendor's certificate of authority must be filed with the registration and\n\nLicensing Services Bureau of the Processing Division, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227 and must be signed by a responsible owner, partner or\nofficer. (3)\n(i) If the Registration and Licensing\n\nServices Bureau consents to the cancellation of the vendor's certificate of\nauthority, it will notify the vendor in writing of the effective date of such\ncancellation. (a) A vendor whose certificate\nof authority has been cancelled in accordance with this subdivision must, within 20 days of the effective date of such cancellation, file a final return\nand surrender its certificate of authority in accordance with the provisions of\n\nPart 533 of this Title.

(ii)\n\nIf the\n\nRegistration and Licensing Services Bureau does not consent to the cancellation\nof the vendor's certificate of authority, it will notify the vendor of such\ndecision in writing. Example: Company X, located in Ohio, is the exclusive manufacturer\nand retailer of a unique product for which it holds a patent. Company X\nsolicits its sales only through advertisements placed in national technology\nmagazines. All orders are filled from Ohio and shipped via common carrier. Although Company X sells products in New York besides its patented product, 90%\nof its sales in New York are of the patented product. The other 10% of the\ncompany's sales are of ancillary products which customers order from Company X\nas a matter of convenience when placing their main order. These other products\nare readily available from other suppliers. During the period September 1, 1988 through August 31, 1989, Company X regularly solicited business in New York State as described in\nsection\n526.10\n(a)(6)\nof\nthe Sales and Use Tax Regulations. Company X filed a certificate of\nregistration with the Tax Department and holds a valid certificate of\nauthority. During the period September 1, 1989 through August 31, 1990, Company\nX had the following sales to customers in New York (summarized by quarterly\nsales tax reporting period): Gross Sales In New\n\nYork\n\nPeriod\n\nNumber of\n\nSales\n\nDollar\n\nAmount\n9/1/89 - 11/30/89\n6,200\n$810,000\n12/1/89 - 2/28/90\n600\n$ 52,000\n3/1/90 - 5/31/90\n500\n$ 43,000\n6/1/90 - 8/31/90\n400\n$ 33,000\n\nTotal (9/1/89 - 8/31/90)\n7,700\n$938,000\n\nDue to a technological breakthrough by one of its\ncompetitors in January 1990, Company X's patented product was made obsolete and\ndemand for this product virtually disappeared. News of the demise of Company\nX's product was cited in a technology magazine article featuring the product of\n\nCompany X's competitor. Company X wrote a letter to the Registration and Licensing\n\nServices Bureau and requested that its certificate of authority be cancelled\nbecause of the change in the volume of business it expected to conduct in New\n\nYork State in the future. Company X included with its submission a copy of the\nmagazine article cited above as well as copies of relevant accounting records. On the basis of the submission made by Company X, written notification was sent\nto it by the Registration and Licensing Services Bureau of the effective date\nof the cancellation of its certificate of authority. Within 20 days after the\neffective date of the cancellation of its certificate of authority, Company X\nfiled its final return and with it submitted payment of all taxes due as well\nas its certificate of authority. (g) (1)\nA\nperson who is a vendor solely by reason of section\n526.10\n(a)(7)\nof\nthis Title must submit a certificate of registration within 30 days after the\nfirst day on which tangible personal property in which such person retains an\nownership interest is brought into this State by the purchaser who; (i) is or becomes a resident of this State, or\n(ii)\nuses the property in any\nmanner in carrying on any employment, trade, business or profession in this\n\nState. Example 1: A resident of New York leases a motor vehicle on October 1, 1990 for two years from a non-New York corporation whose only place of business\nis located outside of New York. The resident picks up the motor vehicle at the\nlessor's place of business on October 1, 1990 and immediately returns to New\n\nYork State with the vehicle. Since the lessor is a vendor solely by reason of\nsection\n526.10\n(a)(7)\nof\nthis Title, it is required to file a certificate of registration with the\ndepartment within 30 days after the day the property was brought into New York\n\nState which in this case means, no later than October 31, 1990. (2)\n\nWhere a\npurchaser of tangible personal property is not a resident of this State when\nthe property is first brought into this State, and such purchaser does not use\nthe property in any manner in carrying on any employment, trade, business or\nprofession in this State, but the purchaser subsequently becomes a resident of\nthis State or uses the property in the purchaser's employment, trade, business\nor profession, the person who sold such property to the purchaser and who\nretains an ownership interest in such property, is a vendor. Such vendor must\nsubmit a certificate of registration within 30 days after the day on which the\npurchaser becomes a resident of this State or uses the property in this State\nin the purchaser's employment, trade, business or profession. Example 2: A non-New York company leases a motor vehicle to a\nnon-resident of New York State. The non-resident of New York uses the vehicle\nin New York while on vacation. Six months later the non-resident moves to New\n\nYork State and becomes a resident, bringing the leased vehicle with him. The non-New York company is a vendor by virtue of section\n1101 (b)(8)(i)(F)\nof the Tax Law and is required to submit a certificate of\nregistration within 30 days after the day on which the lessee became a resident\nof New York, but not when the vehicle first entered the state six months\nprior. (h) The\napplicant for a certificate of authority must submit the following information: (1)\nbusiness name (legal) and\naddress; (2)\n(i) name, social security number and home\naddress of the owner; (ii)\nname, social security number and home address of general partners in a partnership. Include limited partners who are responsible for the day-to-day financial\noperation of the business; (iii)\nname, social security number and home address of responsible persons of a\ncorporation or other entities (\ne.g., president, vice-president, secretary, treasurer, shareholder, fiduciary, trustee, etc). Identify the individuals who are ultimately responsible for the day-to-day\nfinancial operation of the business. Such day-to-day financial operations\ninclude but are not limited to the following: (a) signing checks on the business's bank\naccount; (b) signing the business's\ntax returns; (c) paying the\nbusiness's obligations; (d) making\nthe final decision on which obligations of the business are to be\npaid; (e) conducting the business's\ngeneral financial affairs; (f) filing returns or paying taxes on behalf of the business; or\n(g) complying with any requirement of the Tax\n\nLaw; (3)\nall\ntrade names (doing business as, trading as, etc.) under which the owner, business, partnership or corporation operates; (4)\n(i) business location (physical) and mailing address if different for the principal\nplace of business whether located within or without the State; and\n(ii)\nthe mailing address and location\n(physical) of all business outlets inside the State and the mailing address and\nlocation (physical) of any other business outlet making sales within this\n\nState; (5)\nnames and\naddresses of the previous owners of the business (if applicable); (6)\ndate of commencement or opening of a new\nbusiness; (7)\n\nFederal employer\nidentification number (if applicable); and\n(8)\nany additional information which may be\nrequested. (i) (1)\n\nThe certificate of registration should be\nfiled with the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, Sales Tax\n\nRegistration Unit, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. (2)\n\nWithin five days after a properly\ncompleted certificate of registration is received, the Department of Taxation\nand Finance will either: (i) issue a\ncertificate of authority to collect tax; or\n(ii)\nissue a notice of proposed refusal to\nissue a certificate of authority. (j) (1)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided by part LL-1 of chapter 57 of the Laws of 2008, which directs a re-registration program to be completed by March 31, 2012, and\nimposes a re-registration application fee, there shall be no charge to an\napplicant for a certificate of authority. (2)\n\nThe issuance and/or continuance of a\ncertificate of authority may be conditioned upon the filing of a bond or\nestablishment of a trust account as provided for in section\n539.5\nof this Part. (k) Every person who elects to\nfile a certificate of registration, though not required to do so, to whom a\ncertificate of authority is issued thereby consents to and assumes all the\nobligations of a person required to collect tax. (l) Conducting a business without possessing\na valid certificate of authority. A penalty of up to $500 for the first day of\nbusiness operation without a certificate of authority plus a penalty of up to\n$200 for each subsequent day of operation not to exceed $10,000 in the\naggregate may be imposed for selling tangible personal property or services\nsubject to tax, receiving amusement charges or operating a hotel, purchasing or\nselling tangible personal property for resale, or selling automotive fuel. In\naddition, any person required to file a certificate of registration for a\ncertificate of authority who fails to file such certificate of registration, may be subject to a penalty in an amount not exceeding $200, and/or the\ncriminal penalties provided by section\n1817\nof the Tax Law. (m) Every certificate of authority is subject\nto the suspension and/or revocation procedures described in section\n539.4\nof this Part. (n) (1)\n(i) Except as otherwise provided in this\nsubdivision, a certificate of authority issued pursuant to a certificate of\nregistration filed as provided in this section may be issued for a specified\nperiod of not less than three years and, by its terms, would expire at the end\nof the specified period. (ii)\nA\ncertificate of authority may be issued to a show vendor, entertainment vendor, or temporary vendor for a specified period of less than three years, in which\ncase it will expire at the end of the specified period. (iii)\nA certificate of authority may be\nsubject to an expiration and renewal process in accordance with the terms and\nconditions provided in Part 540 of this Title even if it has not been in effect\nfor its specified period. (iv)\nA\nshow or entertainment vendor whose certificate of authority will expire\n\nDecember 31, 2008, will automatically receive from the department a new\ncertificate of authority, effective January 1, 2009, provided that such vendor\nhas timely filed tax returns and paid the applicable tax due. (2)\n\nAll persons holding a\ncertificate of authority shall, in due course, be required to file a new\ncertificate of registration (renewal). (3)\n\nProcedures for the expiration of the\ncertificate of authority and filing a new certificate of registration (renewal)\nare provided in Part 540 of this Title. (4)\n\nWhen a person holding a certificate of\nauthority requests that the certificate of authority be associated, combined, or consolidated for purposes of the expiration and renewal process with one or\nmore other certificates of authority issued to that person, all of the renewed\ncertificates of authority may be for a common specified period in accordance\nwith paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Example: ABC Company, whose certificate of authority was issued\nthree years ago expanded its operations by adding a retail outlet in each year\nof the past three years. A separate certificate of authority was issued for\neach of the three new locations and separate sales tax returns are filed for\neach location. The sales tax returns are prepared for all locations by the\ncompany's main office. For ease of administration, ABC Company requests that\neach certificate of authority be renewed simultaneously for all its locations, even though the certificates of authority for all locations were originally\nissued at different times. Based upon the written request by the vendor for\nconsolidation for renewal purposes of the certificates of authority, the\ndepartment may: (1)\nexpire the other\nexisting certificates of authority; (2)\nrequire registration renewal applications\nfor all locations; and\n(3)\nissue a\nnew certificate of authority for each location, each of which will be valid for\nthe same specified period.
