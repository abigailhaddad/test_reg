Tit. 15 § 78.45 - Retail dealers selling motor vehicles as junk\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a dealer is selling a junk motor\nvehicle to another dealer, a registered vehicle dismantler or a certified scrap\nprocessor, he shall give such purchaser an MV-50 marked \"wholesale\" along with\nthe proof of ownership. (b) When\nselling a vehicle as junk to a member of the general public, a dealer shall\npresent a form he had printed, called a customer's declaration, to the\ncustomer. The form shall identify the vehicle by year, make, model and vehicle\nidentification number. This form must be signed by the customer before the\ncontract of sale is signed. The form shall have an original and one copy. The\nform shall contain the following four statements: (1)\nI declare that I do not intend to operate\nthis vehicle on the public highways (including public streets, avenues, roads, etc.) at this time. (2)\nI declare\nthat I know that I am buying a junk vehicle which is presently unsuitable for\noperation on the public highways. I know this vehicle must pass inspection\nbefore it may be registered. (3)\nI\ndeclare that I know that before this vehicle may be operated on the public\nhighways, it probably needs extensive repairs, the cost of which may exceed the\npurchase price. The only guarantees about the condition of this vehicle that I\nhave are those I have in writing. (4)\nI declare that I have examined the\nvehicle and that it is described accurately; furthermore, the public vehicle\nidentification number is ________ and is on the vehicle. The customer shall sign the form four times, once after\neach statement. The dealer shall keep the original of all customer's\ndeclarations stored in a safe place for a minimum of three years, after which\nhe may dispose of them. Failure to obtain a customer's declaration signed after\neach statement will result in the treating of the sale as the sale of a used\nvehicle. (c) The\ndealer shall give the retail customer form MV-50, the proof of ownership and a\ncopy of the customer's declaration. For a nontitled vehicle, the proof of\nownership is a transferable registration. For a titled vehicle declared junk, the proof of ownership is form MV-907A (entitled Salvage Certificate). The\ndealer shall not issue an MV-TCR. This form must be marked \"VOID\" and left\nattached to the MV-50. The dealer shall not apply for a title of registration\non the customer's behalf. (d) A\ndealer selling a vehicle as junk warrants that he is legally entitled to sell\nthat vehicle and that there are no undisclosed liens on it. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
