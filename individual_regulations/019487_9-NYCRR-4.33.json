  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.33 - Executive order no. 33: directing the commissioner of environmental conservation to conduct an industrial chemical survey\n\nState Regulations\n\nSound pollution control and emergency preparedness policies\ndepend on the knowledge of industrial hazardous waste disposal practices. A\ncomprehensive mechanism is needed to determine the types and amounts of\nchemical raw materials that are used, stored, manufactured and transported by\nindustries that operate in the State. While the current \"cradle-to-grave\"\nmanifest system, implemented by chapter six hundred thirty-nine of the laws of\nnineteen hundred seventy-eight, is designed to track present and future\ndisposal of hazardous wastes, no systematic industrial survey has been\nundertaken to ascertain industry's hazardous waste disposal practices over the\npast thirty years. It is therefore the purpose of this Order to coordinate the\npractices of the Department of Environmental Conservation in furtherance of an\nindustrial chemical survey to be conducted on an on-going basis. This survey\nwill provide complete information on the types and amounts of potentially toxic\nraw materials used, stored, manufactured or transported in this State. Such a\nsurvey is a necessary and desirable component for successful pollution control\nand emergency preparedness programs. It is further intended that the department shall conduct a\none-year study of waste disposal activities by industries operating in the\n\nState during the past thirty years. This past disposal practices survey will\ndetermine the types, quantities and locations of hazardous wastes previously\ndisposed of by industries in the State. This survey will inform citizens and\nlocal authorities of any dangers posed by chemical dumps in their\ncommunities. THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of New\n\nYork, by virtue of the powers vested in me by the Constitution and Laws of the\n\nState of New York, do hereby promulgate this Order: 1. The Commissioner of Environmental\n\nConservation is directed to conduct an industrial chemical survey to be a\ncomponent of the Department of Environmental Conservation's on-going efforts to\ninsure safe use and proper disposal of potentially toxic chemicals in the\n\nState. Such survey shall be conducted for the purpose of gathering information\non the types and quantities of chemical raw materials used, stored, manufactured or transported in this State, which are on the Department's\nsubstances of concern list. Within ninety days of the date of this Order, the\n\nCommissioner shall develop the industrial chemical survey and distribute it to\nall facilities in the State which fall into the categories listed in section\ntwo of this Order. 2. The survey\nshall be completed by facilities in the State designated by the Commissioner, including, but not limited to, those facilities in the following categories: (a) all facilities in the twenty-one standard\nindustrial classification categories designated under the United States\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency's \"priority pollutant\" control\nprogram; (b) all facilities which\nhold or apply for a national pollution discharge elimination system discharge\npermit; (c) all facilities which\nhold or apply for discharge permits pursuant to Title seven and eight of\n\nArticle seventeen of the Environmental Conservation Law; (d) all facilities which discharge effluents\ninto wastewater collections systems; and\n(e) all solid waste management facilities\nwhich hold or apply for permits or are regulated pursuant to section\n27-0707\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law. 3. After the initial survey to be conducted pursuant to this Order, an additional\nindustrial chemical survey shall be completed by each such facility upon each\napplication for a permit referred to in section two of this Order and upon each\napplication for a renewal of any of such permits. 4. The industrial chemical survey described\nin section two of this Order shall be accompanied by a past hazardous waste\ndisposal questionnaire, which shall require industries to report on the types, quantities, toxic qualities and locations of hazardous wastes generated and\ndisposed of in the State since 1952, if such information exists. Such\nquestionnaire shall also require, where applicable, reporting of the names and\naddresses of the transporters of such wastes from the responding industry to\nthe final disposal site. Such questionnaire shall also require the\nidentification of any internal reports, studies or documents relating to the\ncompany's disposal practices. 5. The Commissioner shall require that the surveys and questionnaire described in\nthis Order shall be completed and returned to the Department no later than 150\ndays after their receipt. 6. The\nresults of the questionnaire described in this Order shall be used to\ncomplement the Department's efforts to complete the inactive sites inventory\nand to set priorities for the undertaking of remedial work on a statewide\nbasis, in addition to facilitating the Department's efforts to manage the\nproblem of existing landfilled hazardous wastes. The Commissioner shall compile\na report based on the past waste disposal questionnaires. Such report shall\ninclude the names and addresses of the participating facilities, and shall be\ndistributed on or before April 1, 1985 to the Governor, the Legislature, the\n\nCommissioner of Health, the Attorney General, all regional offices of the\n\nDepartment and to county health departments. In counties where no such county\nhealth department exists, the report shall be distributed to the office of the\ncounty clerk. 7. Each report\ndistributed to a county health department or an office of the county clerk\nshall have as an appendix copies of the industrial chemical survey responses\nsubmitted by facilities located in the county where the report is distributed, subject to the provisions of section eight of this Order. 8. The Department shall hold any information\nin any survey and questionnaire submitted pursuant to this Order as\nconfidential in accordance with the applicable provisions of section\n87\nof the\n\nPublic Officers Law and section\n27-1311\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law. Information which will be held confidential pursuant to such\nstatutes and which would be otherwise disclosed by the copies of the industrial\nchemical surveys comprising the appendices described in paragraph seven of the\n\nOrder shall be masked or otherwise removed from such copies. 9. For purposes of this Order, the term\n\"hazardous waste\" shall have the same meaning as that provided in Title 9 of\n\nArticle 27 of the Environmental Conservation Law and any regulations\npromulgated thereunder. 10. This\n\nExecutive Order shall take effect immediately. Signed: Mario M. CuomoDated: December 29, 1983\n[FN*] [Revoked by Executive Order No. 31 (George E.
