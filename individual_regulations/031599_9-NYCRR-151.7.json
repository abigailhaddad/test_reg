  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 151.7 - Summary rating review procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Agency review board. (1)\n\nEach agency will\nestablish one or more performance evaluation review boards, as necessary and as\nappropriate within a given agency, to consider requests for review of summary\nratings from employees whose performance has been summarized as below\nminimum. (2)\n\nThe agency review\nboard will consist of three members from among employees in the agency whose\npositions have been either designated managerial or assigned to the\n\nProfessional, Scientific and Technical Services (PS&T) Negotiating Unit. One member designated managerial will be appointed by the agency head or\nhis/her designee; one member will be appointed by the president of the Public\n\nEmployees Federation (PEF) or his designee; and the third member will be\nappointed jointly by both parties from a list of mutually acceptable employees\nwithin the agency who are eligible to serve on the board. (3)\n\nThe agency review board will review the\nemployee's request and make a recommendation to the agency head, or his/her\ndesignee, who will make the final decision in the agency with respect to the\nemployee's request. A board member who participated in the development of an\nemployee's evaluation report shall not participate in the review of the\nemployee's request, nor shall an agency head, or his/her designee, who may be\nresponsible for the final decision in the agency concerning the employee's\nevaluation, participate in deliberations of the agency review board. (b) Statewide review board. The\nstatewide performance evaluation review board is a three-member panel\nestablished for the purpose of reviewing determinations of the agency head or\nhis/her designee in instances where an employee's performance continues to be\nsummarized as below minimum and the employee requests a review of that\ndecision. One member is appointed by the president of PEF, or his designee; one\nmember is appointed by the Director of the Governor's Office of Employee\n\nRelations, or his designee; and a third member, appointed by mutual agreement\nof the president of PEF and the Director of the Governor's Office of Employee\n\nRelations, or their designees. (c) General procedures. (1)\n\nEligibility. Employees who are not on probation and who are rated below minimum may seek to\nraise their summary rating through the review process. (2)\n\nSubject of review. Employees may use the\nreview process only to request a review of their summary rating. Disputes of\nsuch issues as the individual performance program and the rating and review\nprocess are not reviewable. Also, ratings of effective and dollar amounts of\nperformance advances are not subject to review. (3)\n\nTiming. (i) Employees have 14 calendar days from\nreceipt of their summary rating in which to submit a request for\nreview. (ii)\n\nEmployees whose below\nminimum rating is sustained at the agency level will have 14 calendar days from\nreceipt of the decision of the agency head or his/her designee to submit a\nfurther request to the statewide performance evaluation review board. (iii)\n\nIn considering the issue of timeliness, the general rule should be to accept the submission of the request based upon\nthe date that the employee received a copy of his/her completed evaluation\nreport. (4)\n\nPersonal\nappearances by appellant. (i) Employees\nrequesting a review of their rating are entitled to make a personal appearance\nbefore both the agency and statewide review board and are entitled to\nrepresentation by PEF or by a personal representative of their own choosing in\nany such personal appearance. (ii)\n\nAn employee making a personal appearance before a review board during the\nemployee's normal duty hours will be allowed excused time for such an\nappearance, to include necessary travel time. Any time and expenses incurred by\nan employee in preparing and presenting a request for review are the\nresponsibility of the employee. (5)\n\nConduct of review. The agency and\nstatewide review boards' consideration of a request for review will consist\nprimarily of a review of the record. Generally, the record will consist of the\nperformance evaluation report and any written statements presented by the\nemployee and on behalf of management. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
