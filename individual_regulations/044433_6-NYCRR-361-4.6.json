  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 361-4.6 - Groundwater Protection Requirements for Facilities Located in Nassau and Suffolk Counties\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to the other requirements outlined in this\n\nSubpart, the following criteria apply to registered and permitted mulch\nprocessing facilities located in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. (a) Groundwater monitoring. (1)\nA minimum of one upgradient and two\ndowngradient monitoring wells must be installed and maintained at the facility. The department may require installation and operation of additional groundwater\nmonitoring wells, based on site specific conditions. Siting and installation of\nwells must be consistent with acceptable criteria, as outlined in subdivision\n363-4.4\n(k) of this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nGroundwater monitoring\nwells must be sampled quarterly. Results of the analyses must be submitted to\nthe department within 60 days after the sampling event. The parameters for\nanalysis are: groundwater elevation; total dissolved solids (TDS); conductance, turbidity; pH, oxidation reduction potential (ORP); dissolved oxygen; chemical\noxygen demand (COD); Total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN); nitrate nitrogen; sodium; chloride; ammonia; iron; and manganese. After the first year of monitoring, the\nfacility owner or operator may request a reduced sampling frequency, if the\nwater quality consistently meets the applicable groundwater\nstandards. (b) Site\nwater management. Compliance with the following criteria is required if\ngroundwater monitoring indicates that significant degradation of groundwater\nquality has occurred, as determined by the department. Construction must be\ncompleted within one year after notification from the department. (1)\n\nRun-off management criteria. (i) The areas used for the receiving, processing, and storing of incoming materials and product must be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to: (a) direct site water drainage and minimize ponding by sloping or crowning\npads; (b) transmit run-off\ngenerated during the storage and processing of materials to a treatment and/or\ncontainment structure to minimize the potential for waste constituents to enter\ngroundwater or surface water; (c) control and manage all run-off and precipitation that falls onto and within the\nboundaries of those areas from a 25-year, 24-hour peak storm event at a\nminimum; and\n(d) prevent\nstormwater, which has come in contact with waste, from impacting surface waters\nor groundwater, or causing conditions that reduce the ability to use\nneighboring properties. (ii)\n\nWorking surfaces must be sized\nappropriately and constructed to allow year-round equipment access to the piles\nwithout damage to the working surfaces, and treatment and containment\nstructures. (iii)\n\nWorking surfaces\nmust be constructed with a hydraulic conductivity of 1.0 x\n10\n-5\ncm/sec or less, and must consist of one of the\nfollowing: (a) compacted soils, at least one\nfoot thick; (b) asphalt concrete or\n\nPortland cement; or\n(c) an\nequivalent engineered material approved by the department. (iv)\n\nRun-off must be treated by one of the\nfollowing methods, unless other engineering controls are approved by the\ndepartment. (a) Vegetative filters in\ncombination with ponds or alone (for limited flow situations). The vegetative\nfilter must consist of a mix of grasses and forbs, etc. and be designed to\npromote sheet flow. They need to be monitored periodically to: (1)\nremove accumulated sediment and organic\nmatter that affects flow; (2)\nidentify rill erosion and regrade; and\n(3)\nidentify vegetative species with low\nsurvival rates and replace them with more successful native species to maintain\ndense vegetative coverage. (b) Detention and infiltration ponds. Run-off\nmust be directed to a treatment pond system consisting of a minimum of three\ncells. Two cells must be detention ponds designed and operated in accordance\nwith paragraph 361-4.6(b)(6) of this Subpart to allow for maintenance. The\nbottom of any infiltration pond used must be at least five feet above the\nseasonal high groundwater table. (v) Use of run-off and treated run-off. Run-off and treated run-off (emanating from vegetative strips or a pond system)\ncan be used for site dust suppression, to add moisture to the piles, or for\nother means approved by the department. Run-off should be applied in a manner\nthat does not result in erosion. Treated run-off can also be managed through\ninfiltration ponds. Any run-off that cannot be effectively managed on-site must\nbe handled in a manner approved by the department. (2)\n\nStorage and containment criteria. (i) Detention ponds, if used, must: (a) have a liner having a hydraulic\nconductivity of 1.0 x 10\n-6\ncm/sec or less, and must\nconsist of one of the following: (1)\na liner\nsystem consisting of a minimum of a 60-mil high density polyethylene liner, underlain by either one foot of compacted clay or a geosynthetic clay liner\ninstalled over a prepared base; (2)\na liner system that includes Portland cement concrete, designed to minimize\ncracking and infiltration, underlain by a minimum of a 60-mil high-density\npolyethylene liner; or\n(3)\nan\nequivalent engineered material approved by the department; (b) have a leak detection system acceptable\nto the department; (c) at a\nminimum, be designed, constructed, and maintained to prevent overflowing or\novertopping, based on the containment of all diverted site run-off in addition\nto precipitation that falls into the detention pond from a 25-year, 24-hour\npeak storm event; (d) be at least\ntwo feet above the seasonal high groundwater table; (e) be managed to maintain a dissolved oxygen\nconcentration in the upper zone (one foot) of at least 1.0 milligram per liter\n(mg/l). Sediment-free water meeting this dissolved oxygen level can be\ndischarged to an infiltration pond or equivalent; (f) be monitored quarterly, if sufficient\nwater is available, for pH, dissolved oxygen, total dissolved solids, fixed\ndissolved solids, total nitrogen, and specific conductance using methods\nacceptable to the department; and\n(g) be cleaned at least once every\nyear. (ii)\n\nTanks, if\nused, must be designed, constructed, and operated in compliance with the\ncriteria in section\n361-2.7. (iii)\n\nDrainage ditches, if used to convey\nsite water to storage or treatment, must: (a) be able to effectively convey the run-off from a 25-year, 24-hour peak storm\nevent, at a minimum; (b) have a\nliner having a hydraulic conductivity of 1.0 x 10\n-5\ncm/sec or less, and must consist of one of the following: (1)\ncompacted soils, at least one foot\nthick; (2)\nasphalt concrete or\n\nPortland cement; or\n(3)\nan\nequivalent engineered material approved by the department; (c) be properly sloped to minimize ponding, kept free and clear of debris to allow continuous flow of liquid, be adequately\nprotected from erosion; and (d) be cleaned at least once every year. (3)\n\nRun-on\nmanagement criteria. (i) Surface water run-on\nmust be controlled by diversion swales that are constructed on the site\nperimeter to collect potential run-on and direct it to an engineered outlet\nstructure (riprap aprons, etc.) that minimizes erosion; or berms that are\nconstructed on the site perimeter to divert potential run-on to an engineered\noutlet structure (riprap aprons, etc.) that minimizes erosion. Berms must be\nbuilt from fine grained material that can be compacted sufficiently and\nvegetated with a mix of grasses and forbs to prevent erosion and washout. Vegetation must be mowed no less than once per year. (ii)\n\nDiversion swales and berms must be\ndesigned, constructed, and maintained to prevent run-on from a 25-year, 24-hour\npeak storm event, at a minimum. (4)\n\nInspection and reporting. (i) All wells, working surfaces, berms, ditches, and any other run-on and run-off control or treatment devices must be\ninspected at least quarterly. Results of the quarterly inspections must be\nincluded in the annual report required by paragraph 360.19(k)(3) of this Title, and must include: (a) date and time of\ninspection and name of inspector; (b) evidence of deficiencies such as\ncracking, subsidence, erosion, etc.; (c) evidence of ponding on the working\nsurface and within the ditches; (d) effectiveness of erosion control procedures; (e) maintenance that has occurred to control\nrun-off and run-on; (f) evidence of\nany liquid leaving or entering the site, including location, size, and\nquantity; (g) integrity of all\ndrainage and treatment systems; (h) descriptions of all deficiencies and corrections implemented; and\n(i) any other analyses required by this\n\nSubpart. (ii)\n\nAll site\nwater management and treatment devices must be inspected within seven days of\nall major storm events, and any necessary repairs must be made within 30 days. This information must be included in the annual report required by paragraph\n360.19(k)(3) of this Title. (5)\n\nGeneral site criteria. (i) Piles of material must not be placed in\ntopographic depressions that act as either run-off conveyance channels or where\nrun-off accumulates. Piles or windrows must be placed in locations where the\nground surface is crowned or otherwise sloped sufficiently to avoid ponding of\nwater at the bases of the piles. Windrows should be oriented parallel to the\nslope, so that precipitation landing between the windrows can flow freely off\nthe processing area. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
