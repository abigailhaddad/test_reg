Such regulations will be governed by the plan of medical\npayments elected by the district pursuant to State regulations with respect\nthereto. In the case of multiple billing, supporting details for each service\nprovided to each patient must be attached to the bill, unless the description\nof services rendered on the face of the bill is complete. (For example, a\nmultiple bill for drug prescriptions furnished would ordinarily be supported by\ncopies of the prescriptions, except in the unlikely situation where a druggist\nlists the details of a prescription on the face of the bill itself.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
