  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 441.199 - Medicaid (title xix)\n\nState Regulations\nA federally aided, State-operated and administered\nprogram which provides medical benefits for certain low-income persons in need\nof health and medical care. The program, authorized by title XIX of the Social\n\nSecurity Act, is basically for the poor. It does not cover all of the poor, however, but only persons who are members of one of the categories of people\nwho can be covered under the welfare cash payment programs--the aged, the\nblind, the disabled, and members of families with dependent children where one\nparent is absent, incapacitated or unemployed. Subject to broad Federal\nguidelines, states determine the benefits covered, program eligibility, rates\nof payment for providers, and methods of administering the\nprogram. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n441.199\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
