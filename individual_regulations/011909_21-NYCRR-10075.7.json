  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 10075.7 - Wastewater and stormwater discharge regulations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prohibited discharges. No user shall discharge or cause to be discharged, either\ndirectly or indirectly to any public sewers, any substance or wastewater which\ncould interfere with the operation or performance of the authority's\nfacilities. These general prohibitions also apply to all non-domestic users of\nthe authority's facilities whether or not the user is subject to national\npretreatment standards or any other national, state or local pretreatment\nrequirements. The following substances and wastewaters are specifically\nprohibited from discharge into the authority's facilities: (1)\n\nAny liquids, solids or gases which by\nreason of their nature or quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or\nby interaction with other substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious\nin any other way to the POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time, shall\ntwo successive days readings on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of\ndischarge into the system (or at any point in the system), be more than 10\npercent nor any single reading be 20 percent or more of the lower explosive\nlimit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are not limited to: gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers, alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates, carbides, hydrides and sulfides and any other substances which the B.S.A., city, State or\nEPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to the system. (2)\n\nSolid or viscous substances which may\ncause obstruction to the flow in a sewer or other interference with the\noperation of the wastewater treatment facilities such as, but not limited to: grease, animal guts or tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or\nmarble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent\ngrains, spent hops, waste paper, wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining, or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass\ngrinding or polishing wastes. (3)\n\nAny water or wastes having any corrosive property capable of causing damage or\nhazard to structure, equipment of the sewer system, or personnel employed in\nits operation. (4)\n\nAny water or\nwastes containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity, either singly or by\ninteraction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere with any wastewater\ntreatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or animals, create a toxic\neffect in the receiving waters of the sewage treatment plant effluent, or to\nexceed the limitation set forth in a categorical pretreatment standard. A toxic\npollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified\npursuant to section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act. (5)\n\nAny water or wastes containing any\nchemical or biological constituent or having physical characteristics which\ncould cause interference with any POTW wastewater treatment process. (6)\n\nAny noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either singly or by interaction with other wastes are\nsufficient to create a public nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to\nprevent entry into the sewers for maintenance and repair. (7)\n\nAny garbage containing particles greater\nthan one-half inch in any dimension. The installation and operation of any\ngarbage grinder equipped with a motor of three-fourths horse power (0.76 hp\nmetric) or greater shall be subject to the review and approval of the general\nmanager. (8)\n\nMaterials which exert\nor cause discolorations, such as, but not limited to, dye waters and vegetable\ntanning solution. (9)\n\nIn no case, shall a substance discharged to the authority's facilities cause the authority\nto be in noncompliance with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or\nregulations developed under section 405 of the Clean Water Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting sludge use or disposal developed pursuant\nto Federal, State or local laws and regulations. (10)\n\nAny substance which will cause the\nauthority to violate its N.P.D.E.S./S.P.D.E.S. permit or the receiving water\nquality standards. (11)\n\nAny\nsubstance or wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a public\nnuisance. (b) Discharge of stormwater. (1)\n\nNo\nperson shall cause or contribute to an illicit discharge, either directly or\nindirectly, to any storm sewers. These general prohibitions also apply to all\nindustrial users of the authority's facilities whether or not the user is\nsubject to national pretreatment standards or any other national, State or\nlocal pretreatment requirements. The following activities are exempt from the\nrequirements of this section: (i) water line\nflushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, existing diverted stream flows, rising groundwater, uncontaminated groundwater\ninfiltration into storm drains, uncontaminated pumped groundwater, foundation\nor footing drains, crawl space of basement sump pumps, air conditioning\ncondensate, irrigation water, springs, water from individual residential car\nwashing, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, dechlorinated swimming pool\ndischarges, residential street wash water, water from fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants, and unless the\nN.Y.S.D.E.C. has determined such discharges to be substantial contributors of\npollutants; (ii)\ndischarges\napproved in writing by the general manager to protect life or property from\nimminent harm or damage, provided that, such approval shall not be construed to\nconstitute compliance with other applicable laws and requirements, and further\nprovided that such discharges may be permitted for a specified time period and\nunder such conditions as the general manager may deem appropriate to protect\nsuch life and property while reasonably maintaining the purpose and intent of\nthis regulation; and\n(iii)\ndye\ntesting in compliance with applicable State and local laws is an allowable\ndischarge, but requires a notification to the general manager prior to the time\nof the test. (2)\n\nThe\nabove prohibition shall not apply to any discharge permitted under a SPDES\npermit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the user and administered\nunder the authority of the N.Y.S.D.E.C., provided that the user is in full\ncompliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other\napplicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been\ngranted for any discharge to the MS4. (3)\n\nExcept with the approval of the general\nmanager, or as otherwise provided in these regulations, no storm water\nconnection from any building or yard, nor any drain from any catch basin, lake, swamp, pond, or swimming pool, nor any outlet for surface runoff, storm water\nor ground water of any kind shall be connected to public sanitary sewer or to\nany private sanitary sewer connected to any such public sanitary\nsewer. (4)\n\nWithin any area served\nby a sanitary sewer and a separate storm sewer, no storm water shall be allowed\nto enter waste or vent pipes from any building. Within any such area no down\nspout, roof leaders, gutters, other pipes, or drains such as channels which may\nat any time carry storm water surface drainage derived from hydraulic pressure\nor from well points, cooling water or lake water shall be connected with any\nsanitary sewer, but must be connected to said storm sewer. (5)\n\nUpon notification to a person that he is\nengaged in activities that cause or contribute to violations of the B.S.A. or\ncity's MS4 SPDES permit authorization, that person shall take all reasonable\nactions to correct such activities such that he no longer causes or contributes\nto violations of the B.S.A. or city's MS4 SPDES permit authorization. (6)\n\nNo person shall engage in any activities\nthat cause or contribute to a violation of the authority's SPDES stormwater\ndischarge permit or the authority being subject to the following special\nconditions: (i) discharge compliance with\nwater quality standards. The condition that applies where the B.S.A. or the\ncity has been notified that the discharge of stormwater authorized under its\nMS4 permit may have caused or has the reasonable potential to cause or\ncontribute to the violation of an applicable water quality standard. Under this\ncondition the B.S.A. or city must take all necessary actions to ensure future\ndischarges do not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality\nstandards; (ii)\n303(d) listed\nwaters. The condition in the B.S.A. or city's MS4 permit that applies where the\nMS4 discharges to a 303(d) listed water. Under this condition the stormwater\nmanagement program must ensure no increase of the listed pollutant of concern\nto the 303(d) listed water; (iii)\ntotal maximum daily load (TMDL) strategy. The condition in the B.S.A. or city's\nMS4 permit where a TMDL including requirements for control of stormwater\ndischarges has been approved by E.P.A. for a waterbody or watershed into which\nthe MS4 discharges. If the discharge from the MS4 did not meet the TMDL\nstormwater allocations prior to September 10, 2003, the B.S.A. or city was\nrequired to modify its stormwater management program to ensure that reduction\nof the pollutant of concern specified in the TMDL is achieved; and\n(iv)\nthe condition in the B.S.A. or city's\nMS4 permit that applies if a TMDA is approved in the future by E.P.A. for any\nwaterbody or watershed into which an MS4 discharges. Under this condition the\nB.S.A. or city must review the applicable TMDL to see if it includes\nrequirements for control of stormwater discharges. If an MS4 is not meeting the\nTMDL stormwater allocations, the municipality must, within six months of the\nTMDL's approval, modify its stormwater management program to ensure that\nreduction of the pollutant of concern specified in the TMDL is\nachieved. (7)\n\nUpon\nnotification to a person that he or she is engaged in activities that cause or\ncontribute to violations of the authority's SPDES stormwater discharge permit\nauthorization, that person shall take all reasonable actions to correct such\nactivities such that he or she no longer causes or contributed to violations of\nthe authority's SPDES stormwater discharge permit authorization. (c) Cooling water\ndischarge. The discharge of noncontact cooling water, uncontaminated\ncontact cooling water or unpolluted process waters to a storm sewer or combined\nsewer without the approval of the general manager is prohibited. (d) Limited\ndischarges. (1)\n\nNo person shall\ndischarge or cause to be discharged into the public sewerage system any\nsubstance or wastes which exceed the limits established below: (i) Any water or wastes having a pH lower\nthan 5.0 or higher than 12.0. (ii)\n\nAny liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150 degrees Fahrenheit\n(150°F) (65°C), but in no case heat in such quantities that the temperature at\nthe B.S.A. treatment plant exceeds 104 degrees Fahrenheit (104°F) (40° C). If\nin the opinion of the general manager, lower temperatures of such wastes could\nharm either the sewers, sewage treatment process, or equipment, have an adverse\neffect on the receiving stream, or could otherwise endanger life, health or\nproperty, or constitute a nuisance, the general manager may prohibit such\ndischarges. (iii)\n\nAny water or\nwaste containing substances which may precipitate, solidify or become viscous\nat temperatures between 0°C (32°F) and 40°C (104°F). (iv)\n\nAny waters or wastes exceeding the mass\ndischarge limits issued to any industrial user under the BPDES permit system. These mass limits shall be issued in conformance with the methods presented in\nthe B.S.A. Mass Allocation Manual (see Appendix 52 of this Title). These mass\nallocations may be amended from time to time as such amendment is deemed\nnecessary by the general manager to protect the B.S.A. sewage conveyance and\ntreatment facilities, human life or health. In addition, mass allocations for\nother pollutants may be established when, in the opinion of the general\nmanager, such mass allocations are necessary to protect collection facilities\nand treatment plant processes or equipment, to diminish or eliminate adverse\neffects on the receiving stream quality, to protect life, health and property, or to prevent nuisance conditions. (v) Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of\nsuch half-life or concentrations as may exceed limits established by applicable\n\nFederal, State, or other public agencies having jurisdiction. (vi)\n\nQuantities of flow, concentrations, or\nboth, which constitute a slug as defined herein. (vii)\n\nAny water or wastes which contain oil\nand grease/hydrocarbon (also referred to as total extractable petroleum\nhydrocarbons) in excess of 100 mg/l as determined on the basis of a single\ncomposite sample. (viii)\n\nAny water\nor wastes which contain total phenol in excess of 8 mg/l as determined on the\nbasis of a single composite sample. (ix)\n\nAny discharge of water, sewage or waste\ncontaining pollutant concentrations which exceed the following limits: POLLUTANT\nMaximum Allowable Instantaneous Discharge\n\nLimits (MAID)\n*\nChloroform\n8.5 mg/l\n1,2,4 trichlorobenzene\n0.8 mg/l\n\nFluoranthene\n0.1 mg/l\n\nPyrene\n0.1 mg/l\n\nEndosulfan\n1.6 mg/l\n4,42 - DDD\n0.68 mg/l\nBHC\n1.9 mg/l\nPCBs\n0.002 mg/l\n\nPhenol (Total)\n20.0 mg/l\n\nSelenium\n2.4 mg/l\n\nSilver\n2.2 mg/l\n\nCadmium\n40.0 mg/l\n\nChromium, Total\n40.0 mg/l\n\nChromium, Hexavalent\n9.2 mg/l\n\nCopper\n16.0 mg/l\n\nMercury\n7.0 mg/l\n\nNickel\n14.0 mg/l\n\nLead\n65.0 mg/l\n\nZinc\n25.0 mg/l\n\nCyanide, Total\n66.0 mg/l\n\nCyanide, Amenable\n6.2 mg/l\n* Compliance determined on the basis of a grab sample. (2)\n\nFor facilities with\nmultiple outfalls to the public sewer, the limits established above shall apply\nto each individual outfall. The exceptions to this are mass limits and total\nphenol. Mass discharge limits issued to any facility under the BPDES permit\nsystem shall apply to the total discharge from all outfalls at that facility. The phenol limit shall also apply to the composite of all discharges from a\nfacility. (e) Notification of slug discharge. The industrial user shall immediately telephone and notify\nthe B.S.A. treatment plant in the event of any slug discharge. For facilities\nwith multiple outfalls to the sewer, the slug restriction applies to each\nindividual outfall. The 24-hour B.S.A. telephone number is (716) 883-1820 or, if busy, call (716) 853-2459. (f) Discharge of abnormal\n(surchargeable) strength sewage. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the\npublic sewerage system wastes having BOD\n5, TSS, or total\nphosphate concentrations in excess of 250 mg/l, 250 mg/l and 15.35 mg/l, respectively except and until the prior approval of the general manager\ndetermines the volume and character of such wastes to otherwise be in\ncompliance with all pertinent Federal, State, and local regulations, all other\nprovisions of these regulations, and not to cause overloading of the\nauthority's facilities then approval for such discharge will be granted subject\nto payment of a surcharge determined as set forth in the B.S.A. Schedule of\n\nSewer Rents and Other Charges (see Appendix 52 of this Title). (g) Dilution of\ndischarges. (1)\n\nNo industrial user\nshall ever increase the use of process water or, in any other way, attempt to\ndilute a discharge as a means for obtaining compliance with any prohibited or\nlimited discharge requirement of these regulations or any Federal or State\npretreatment requirement. (2)\n\nThe\nauthority may impose mass limitations on industrial users which are using\ndilution to meet any requirement of these regulations or in other cases where\nthe imposition of mass limitations is appropriate. (h) Federal categorical pretreatment\nstandards. As Federal categorical pretreatment standards are\npromulgated, the Federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed\nunder these regulations, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed\nunder these regulations. (i) Right of revision. The Buffalo Sewer Authority recognizes that in some cases\n\nFederal and State pretreatment standards may not be sufficient to protect the\noperation of its treatment works, or make it unable to comply with the terms of\nits S.P.D.E.S. permit. In such cases, the Buffalo Sewer Authority reserves the\nright to impose more stringent pretreatment standards than those specified in\nthe EPA regulations. (j) Modification of Federal categorical pretreatment standards. The B.S.A. may apply for modification of and subsequently may\nmodify specific discharge limits in any Federal pretreatment standard, in\naccordance with procedures set forth in\n40 CFR section\n403.7: General Pretreatment Regulations for\n\nExisting and New Sources of Pollution. (k) Accidental and spill\ndischarges. (1)\n\nIn the case of an\naccidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately\ntelephone and notify the B.S.A. treatment plant of the incident. (The 24-hour\nB.S.A. telephone No. is [716] 883-1820 or, if first number is busy, call [716]\n853-2459). The notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions being taken. Within five days\nfollowing an accidental discharge, the user shall submit to the general manager\na written report describing the cause of discharge and the measures which will\nbe taken by the user to prevent recurrence of the noncompliance. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding other requirements of\nthese regulations, as soon as any person responsible for a building, facility\nor operation, or responsible for emergency response for a building, facility or\noperation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which\nare resulting or may result in illicit discharges or pollutants discharging\ninto the MS4, that person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the\ndiscovery, containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a\nrelease of hazardous materials, emergency response agencies of the occurrence\nvia emergency dispatch services shall be notified immediately by the owner or\noperator. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, the B.S.A. shall be notified in person or by telephone or facsimile no later than the next\nbusiness day by the owner or operator. Notifications in person or by telephone\nshall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the B.S.A. within\nthree business days of the telephone notice. If the discharge of prohibited\nmaterials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or\noperator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of\nthe discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records\nshall be retained for a least three years. (3)\n\nCompliance with this section of these\nregulations shall not relieve the user of other liability or expense for damage\nto the authority's facilities or other damage to person or property; nor shall\nsuch notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other\nliability which may be imposed by this article or other applicable\nlaw. (l) Best\nmanagement practices. (1)\n\nWhere the\ngeneral manager has identified illicit discharges or activities contaminating\nstormwater, the B.S.A. may require implementation of best management practices\n(BMPs) to control those illicit discharges and activities. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator of a commercial or\nindustrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable\nprotection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes\ninto the MS4 through the use of structural and non-structural BMPs. (3)\n\nAny person responsible for a property or\npremise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge or an activity\ncontaminating stormwater, may be required to implement, at such person's\nexpense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to reduce or eliminate\nthe source of pollutant(s) to the MS 4. (4)\n\nCompliance with all terms and conditions\nof a valid SPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with\nindustrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with\nthe provisions of this section.
