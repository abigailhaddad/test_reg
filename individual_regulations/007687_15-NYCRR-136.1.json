  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 136.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Intent. Section\n510\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law provides that a license may be issued after\nrevocation in the discretion of the commissioner. In exercising such discretion\nand in keeping with his responsibility to provide meaningful safeguards for the\ngeneral public who are users of the highways, it is the purpose of the\ncommissioner to utilize departmental driver improvement programs in order to\nrehabilitate problem drivers through the use of education and explanation. It\nis the further purpose of the commissioner to take disciplinary action in order\nto force a change in the attitude and driving habits of problem drivers, where\nthe department's review indicates that such action is necessary for the\nprotection of the applicant and the public alike. This Part is intended to\nimplement such purposes by establishing criteria to identify individual problem\ndrivers, the application of which shall result in a presumption, in certain\ncases, that the involved driver would present a potential danger to himself or\nother users of the highway if allowed to be licensed or relicensed. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nProblem driver. A problem driver is an\napplicant for a driver's license or privilege who has had a series of\nconvictions, incidents and/or accidents or has a medical or mental condition, which in the judgment of the commissioner or his or her designated agent, upon\nreview of the applicant's entire driving history, establishes that the person\nwould be an unusual and immediate risk upon the highways. The commissioner or\nhis or her designated agent shall set forth in writing the basis for the\ndetermination that an applicant is a problem driver. (2)\n\nDisability. A disability is any\ncondition, whether mental, emotional or physiological, which is likely to\ndiminish the ability of an individual to safely control or operate a motor\nvehicle. (3)\n\nHistory of abuse of\nalcohol or drugs. A history of abuse of alcohol or drugs shall consist of a\nrecord of two or more incidents, within a 10-year period, of operating a motor\nvehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages and/or drugs or of\nrefusing to submit to a chemical test not arising out of the same incident, whether such incident was committed within or outside of this State. (4)\n\nRehabilitative effort. Rehabilitative\neffort shall consist of referral of an individual with a history of abuse of\nalcohol or drugs to any agency certified by the Office of Alcoholism and\n\nSubstance Abuse and/or agents authorized by professional license or\nprofessional certification, such as that granted by a board of examiners of the\n\nState Education Department, for evaluation of the extent of alcohol and/or drug\nuse and satisfactory participation in any treatment recommended by such agency, and/or evidence of abstinence from, or controlled use of, alcohol and/ or drugs\nfor a period of time sufficient to indicate that such person no longer\nconstitutes a danger to other users of the highway. (5)\n\nSafety factor. A safety factor is a\nconviction for, or a finding by a departmental hearing officer of, any\nviolation of the Vehicle and Traffic Law or of any local law, ordinance, order, rule or regulation relating to traffic, except violations relating to parking, standing or stopping; an accident with conviction involvement; an accident\nwhere a finding of gross negligence in the operation of a motor vehicle or\noperating a motor vehicle in a manner showing a reckless disregard for the life\nor property of others is made by a departmental hearing officer; and a finding\nof a chemical test refusal. A bail forfeiture shall be considered a conviction\nfor purposes of this Part. (c) The provisions of this Part shall apply\nto an application for restoration of a driver's license or driving\nprivilege. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
