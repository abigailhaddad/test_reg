  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 305.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n\nLiving in a home with an alcoholic or alcohol abusing person, whether parent, sibling, grandparent, guardian or other person, can be\ndifficult for a child, and the combined problems in the household relationships\nand environment may have adverse effects on such a child not only in childhood, but in adulthood as well. Research and clinical evidence have shown that\nchildren in alcoholic households are at higer risk in developing alcoholism or\nother alcohol related problems themselves than are their peers who grow up in\nhomes where alcoholism or alcohol abuse is not present. Regrettably, such\nchildren are often reluctant to seek help from available resources such as\nschool guidance counselors, clergymen or even from relatives and are often\nunaware of or unfamiliar with other available community resources. It is\nessential for the welfare of such children that competent, sympathetic and\ncaring help provided by qualified professionals in the form of preventive\nalcoholism counseling services be available to them throughout the\n\nState. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 14\n§\n305.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
