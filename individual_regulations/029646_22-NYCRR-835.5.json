  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 835.5 - Compensation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Claims by attorneys for children for services rendered pursuant to Family Court\n\nAct section 245 shall be submitted for approval to the Family Court judge on\nforms authorized by the Chief Administrator of the Courts; after approval or\nmodification, the Family Court shall forward the claim to the Appellate\n\nDivision for approval and certification to the Comptroller for payment. If a\nclaim is received by the Appellate Division more than 90 days after the date of\ncompletion of services, the attorney may be requested to provide an affidavit\n(1) stating that counsel has not previously applied for payment or been paid\nfor the services in question, and (2) explaining the reasons for the delay in\nsubmitting the claim for payment. The Appellate Division reserves the right to\ndisapprove any claim for compensation received more than 90 days after the date\nof completion of services. (b) Claims for compensation in excess\nof the statutory limits set by Family Court Act section 245 and Judiciary Law\nsection 35 shall be accompanied by a sworn statement by the attorney describing\nthe nature of the proceeding, specifying the time and services rendered and\nexpenses incurred, and detailing the circumstances deemed to be extraordinary\njustifying a fee in excess of the statutory limits. In the absence of the\nattorney's affidavit in support of the excess fee, compensation in excess of\nstatutory limits shall not be allowed. (1)\n\nThe following are among the factors\nwhich may be considered in determining whether extraordinary circumstances\nexist justifying a fee in excess of statutory limits: (i) unusually complex factual or legal\nissues; (ii)\nnovel\nissues of law requiring extensive legal research; (iii)\nlengthy and necessary\ntrial or other in-court proceedings which alone raise the compensation claim\nabove statutory limits; and\n(iv)\nother unique or unusual\ncircumstances which required the attorney for the child to spend additional\ntime on a case raising the compensation claim above statutory limits. (2)\n\nThe expenditure\nof time alone will not ordinarily be considered an extraordinary circumstance\nwarranting additional compensation. (c) When an attorney for the\nchild expects the reasonable expenses of representation allowable pursuant to\n\nFamily Court Act section 245 and Judiciary Law section 35 to exceed $1,000, for\ninvestigative, expert or other services, the attorney, before incurring such\nexpenses, shall obtain the approval of the judge presiding in the proceeding\nand of the Appellate Division.
