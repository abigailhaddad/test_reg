[Title\n28\nCFR\n20.3(c)\n]  Criminal\njustice agencies are courts and any government agency or any subunit thereof\nwhich performs the administration of criminal justice pursuant to a statute or\nexecutive order and which allocates a substantial part of its annual budget to\nthe administration of criminal justice. (j) An agency identifier (ORI) is a\nnine-character alphanumeric code assigned to criminal justice, law enforcement\nand non-criminal justice agencies by NCIC in accord with NCIC rules and\nregulations, and to State Emergency Management Office (SEMO) associated\nagencies by the Division of State Police. There are four types of ORI: (1)\nA criminal justice ORI is an agency\nidentifier assigned to a governmental agency or subunit thereof performing a\ncriminal justice function other than apprehension of suspected violators of the\nlaw. Agencies with criminal justice ORI's may access all information available\nvia NYSPIN, providing a use and dissemination agreement has been entered into\nwith the Division of State Police. (2)\nA law enforcement ORI is an agency\nidentifier assigned to a governmental agency or subunit thereof having\nstatutory powers of arrest and whose primary function is that of apprehension\nand detection of suspected violators of the law. Law enforcement agencies may\naccess all information available via NYSPIN, providing a use and dissemination\nagreement has been entered into with the Division of State Police.

A non- criminal justice agency may access only that\ninformation available through NYSPIN consistent with the agency's\nadministration of criminal justice, but never criminal history record\ninformation, providing a use and dissemination agreement has been entered into\nwith the Division of State Police. (4)\nA SEMO ORI is a restricted agency\nidentifier assigned by the Division of State Police to the New York State\n\nEmergency Management Office (SEMO), the Disaster Preparedness Commission (DPC)\nand the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), as described in Executive\n\nOrder Number 32, dated December 29, 1983, and the Disaster Relief Act of 1974, P.L. 93-228, and includes primary and secondary warning points, as well as the\n\nNational Weather Service. These ORI's, except in time of State or National\n\nEmergency, are restricted to sending and receiving messages associated with\nweather information, in conjunction with the National Weather Service, and\ndirection and control messages associated with SEMO, DPC or FEMA directives, emergencies or drills. All such authorized messages may be disseminated to\npublic safety agencies and organizations, including but not limited to fire\ncompanies, rescue teams, emergency medical services and other providers of\nemergency assistance, as required, in accord with SEMO/DPC/FEMA procedures for\ncoordinating emergencies or alerting the public to potential emergencies. Under\nno circumstance will a SEMO ORI be permitted to access CHRI. (k) Administration of criminal\njustice. [Title\n28\nCFR\n20.3(d)\n]  The\nadministration of criminal justice means the performance of any of the\nfollowing activities: detection, apprehension, detention, pretrial release, prosecution, adjudication, correctional supervision, or rehabilitation of\naccused persons or criminal offenders.
