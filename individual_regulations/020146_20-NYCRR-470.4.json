Tit. 20 § 470.4 - Permit requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 502\n(a) A permit is required for each of the\nvehicles described in section\n470.2, supra, having a maximum gross weight in excess of 18,000\npounds and each omnibus described in section\n470.2, supra. Since a tractor and a trailer are each motor vehicles, a separate permit is required for every tractor and every trailer with a\nmaximum gross weight in excess of 18,000 pounds (see §§\n472.3\nand\n472.4, infra, for determinations of maximum gross weight). (b) In addition, if the carrier elects the\nunloaded weight method of computing the truck mileage tax (see §\n481.1\net seq. ), a permit is also required for every tractor having\nan unloaded weight in excess of 4,000 pounds and for every truck having an\nunloaded weight in excess of 8,000 pounds, even if the maximum gross weight of\nthe tractor or truck is 18,000 pounds or less (see §\n471.6, infra, for motor vehicles having maximum gross weights of\n18,000 pounds or less). Example 1: If a tractor, having an unloaded weight of 12,200 pounds, and a maximum gross weight of 62,000 pounds, is used either with trailer A\n(having an unloaded weight of 10,650 pounds and a maximum gross weight of\n44,000 pounds) and trailer B (having an unloaded weight of 9,270 pounds and a\nmaximum gross weight of 40,000 pounds), a separate permit is required for the\ntractor and a separate permit is also required for each trailer, since the\nmaximum gross weight of each is in excess of 18,000 pounds. Example 2: If a trailer having a maximum gross weight of 16,000\npounds is used with a tractor having an unloaded weight of 3,500 pounds, separate permits are required for the tractor and trailer, since the maximum\ngross weight of each in combination with the other is in excess of 18,000\npounds. Example 3: If a trailer having a maximum gross weight of 10,000\npounds is used with a tractor having an unloaded weight of 2,500 pounds, no\npermit is required for either the tractor or the trailer, even if the carrier\nelects the unloaded weight method of computing the tax, since the unloaded\nweight of the tractor is not over 4,000 pounds and the maximum gross weight of\neach is not over 18,000 pounds. Example 4: If a trailer having a maximum gross weight of 10,000\npounds is used with a tractor having an unloaded weight of 5,000 pounds and if\nthe carrier elects the unloaded weight method of computing the tax, a permit is\nrequired for the tractor but no permit is required for the trailer since its\nmaximum gross weight is not over 18,000 pounds. If the carrier does not elect\nthe unloaded weight method of computing the tax, no permit is required for the\ntractor since its maximum gross weight is not over 18,000\npounds. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
