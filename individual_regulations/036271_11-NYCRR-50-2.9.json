The contract shall include a statement of the basis for determining the date as of which a payment received during the period of grace shall be applied to produce the values arising therefrom under the contract; (2)\nA provision that at any time within one year from the date of default in making stipulated payments to the insurer, during the life of the annuitant and unless the cash surrender value has been paid, the contract will be reinstated, on the application of the person entitled thereto pursuant to the provisions of the contract, upon payment to the insurer of such overdue payments as required by the contract and of all indebtedness to the insurer on the contract. The contract shall include a statement of the basis for determining the date as of which the amount to cover the overdue payments and indebtedness shall be applied to produce the values arising therefrom under the contract. Where appropriate, the contract may contain a provision requiring, as a condition for reinstatement, evidence of insurability, including good health, reasonably satisfactory to the insurer; (3)\nA provision specifying the options available, prior to the commencement date of the annuity, in the event of default in a stipulated payment or of surrender of the contract. (i) Such options in the event of surrender shall include an option to receive the cash surrender value of the contract. Such options in the event of default in a stipulated payment shall include an option to receive the cash surrender value and an option to receive a paid-up annuity to commence at the maturity date provided in the contract if the contract is not surrendered for cash. (ii)\n\nThe contract shall specify the method by which, and the date as of which, the accumulated value of the contract shall be determined and may provide for the deduction therefrom of a surrender charge in arriving at the amount of cash surrender value payable. Such surrender charge shall not be greater than the amount produced by the percentages in the following table, less the premium charge percentage, if any, provided for under the contract: Year 1\n\nYear 2\n\nYear 3\n\nYear 4\n\nYear 5\n\nYear 6\n\nYear 7\n\nYear 8 and Later\n8%\n8%\n7%\n6%\n5%\n4%\n3%\n0%\n(iii)\n\nWith respect to any additional premium paid under the contract, the insurer may provide for a surrender charge associated with such additional premium, determined as though the contract holder had purchased a separate contract with such additional premium. The contract shall specify whether the surrender charge is applied to the premiums received or the accumulated value or the portion of such amounts associated with a given premium if the contract is premium specific. If the contract is premium specific, the surrender charge shall be applied on a first in, first out basis. (iv)\n\nIf the option to receive a paid-up annuity is elected, the accumulated value of the contract in the separate account or accounts of the insurer at the time of default shall, at the option of the contract holder, be transferred to the general account of the insurer to provide a fixed dollar paid-up annuity. Any amounts so transferred may be subject to a deferral as provided in paragraph (4) of this subdivision. The kind and amount of the paid-up annuity and the conditions of its payment shall be in accordance with the provisions of the contract and the purchase rates stipulated therein subject to paragraph (5) of this subdivision; (4)\n\nIn connection with a reservation of right to defer cash surrender payments, any individual separate account contract shall provide, if and to the extent permitted or required under the federal Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and any other applicable federal or state law, that the insurer reserves the right, at its option, to defer the: (i) determination and payment of any cash surrender value for a period of six months after demand therefor with surrender of the contract; (ii)\ndetermination and payment of any cash surrender value for a period of nine months in which installments will be paid; or\n(iii)\npayment of any cash surrender value in accordance with the deferment provisions of the federal Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended; and\n(5)\nA provision that the annuity benefits, at the time they are determined, shall not be less than the benefits that would be paid if the accumulated value were used to purchase any single consideration annuity contract then offered by the insurer to the same class of annuitants. (b) No group separate account contract providing variable benefits shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this State and no certificate shall be used in connection therewith unless it contains, with respect to such variable benefits, in substance the following provisions to the extent that such provisions apply to such contract or certificate, as the case may be, or provisions that in the opinion of the superintendent are appropriate to group separate account contracts and are more favorable to certificate holders or annuitants, or not less favorable to certificate holders or annuitants and more favorable to contractholders: (1)\nA provision that there shall be a period of grace either of 30 days or of one month, within which any stipulated payment to be remitted by the holder to the insurer, falling due after one year from date of issue may be made, during which period of grace the contract shall continue in full force. The contract shall include a statement of the basis for determining the date as of which any such payment received during the period of grace shall be applied to produce the values arising therefrom under the contract; and\n(2)\nA provision, with an appropriate reference thereto in the certificate specifying the options available to the certificate holder or an annuitant who contributes to the cost of the annuity, or to the certificate holders or annuitant's beneficiary or beneficiaries in the event of: (i) the termination of the employee's employment or the termination of the group separate account annuity contract, while the certificate holder or annuitant is alive and prior to the commencement date of the annuity; or\n(ii)\nthe death of the certificate holder or annuitant prior to the commencement date of the annuity.

The disclosure form in Appendix 28 shall not be combined with other disclosure, such as a prospectus, except that it may be combined with the disclosure statement required by Insurance Law section 3209(b)(2).

(i) No separate account contract shall include investment funds that purport to provide benefits, features, or investment strategies that are, in the opinion of the superintendent, similar to non-guaranteed index benefits with buffer and floor features as discussed in this section.
