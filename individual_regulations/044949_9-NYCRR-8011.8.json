Tit. 9 § 8011.8 - Protecting contacts when there is a significant risk of contracting or transmitting HIV infection\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ndivision will seek to protect individuals in contact with protected\nindividuals, when such contact creates a significant risk of contracting or\ntransmitting HIV infection through the exchange of significant risk body\nsubstances, as defined by the Department of Health and in section\n8011.2\n(o) of this\n\nPart. (b) The following procedures\nwill be adopted with respect to employees: (1)\n\nEmployees will be instructed to use\nuniversal precautions in situations where there is the potential for exchange\nof significant risk body substances as defined by the Department of Heath and\nin section\n8011.2\n(o) of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nAppropriate protective\nclothing and equipment will be kept at an identified location at each work\nsite. (3)\n\nEach work site is to\ndevelop its own protocol, which is to be posted in areas accessible to all\nemployees, for obtaining medical assistance for emergency situations. (4)\n\nIn the event of a work related potential\nexposure reported to the division (e.g., a needle stick), an employee involved\nin the potential exposure is to be referred to the employee health service for\ncounseling and appropriate medical treatment. (5)\n\nThe division will promulgate risk\nreduction guidelines specific to the parole context and will ensure that all\nemployees receive a copy of the guidelines and training with respect to the\nguidelines. (c) The\nfollowing procedures will be adopted with respect to members of the public who\nare potential contacts of releasees. (1)\n\nThe\nfamilies and/or individuals with whom a post-release residence is proposed, of\nall releasees, will be provided with information which will enable such\nindividuals to make informed decisions regarding behavior that may limit the\nrisk of contracting or transmitting AIDS. Such information will be made\navailable to the families, or persons with whom a residence is proposed, of all\nreleasees, regardless of the division's knowledge of the releasee's HIV status, and recipients of information will be advised that information packets are\nbeing provided to all families, regardless of a particular releasee's HIV\nstatus. Such information will consist of literature available to the division\nfor distribution, whether of a general informational nature, or specifically\ntailored to the parole context. (2)\n\nAll releasees will be counseled to behave in ways that minimize the risk of\ncontracting or transmitting HIV infection. Those releasees known to have a\nconfirmed diagnosis of AIDS, HIV-related illness or HIV infection will be\ncounseled with a view to encourage them to inform their families, or persons\nwith whom a residence is proposed, and any contacts as defined in section\n8011.2\n(l) of this\n\nPart, of their HIV status for the purposes of limiting infection. A releasee\nwho has told parole staff that he or she plans to notify a contact will also be\nencouraged to execute a release of confidential HIV-related information\npermitting disclosure to contact(s) so that authorized employees of the\ndivision may participate in any discussions with the protected individual and\nhis or her contacts that may occur in the course of parole supervision and that\nmay involve confidential HIV-related information. (3)\n\nIn the event that a releasee known to\nhave a confirmed diagnosis of AIDS, HIV-related illness or HIV infection has\nbeen counseled in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision, and the\nreleasee refuses to execute a consent for release of confidential HIV-related\ninformation to contacts, and the parole officer or other employee providing\ntreatment or parole services has an articulable factual basis for believing\nthat there is a known contact at significant risk of contracting HIV infection\nfrom the releasee and that the releasee will not inform the said contact of the\nreleasee's HIV status, then the parole officer may, in accordance with policies\nand procedures of the division, request that an application be made for a court\norder permitting disclosure of confidential HIV-related information pursuant to\n\nPublic Health Law, section 2785.
