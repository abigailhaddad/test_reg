  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 354.5 - Preliminary probation procedures at intake\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Criterion for determining a suitable\ncase. (1)\nA suitable case shall meet all the\nfollowing conditions: (i) probation intake\ndetermines that the case is in the apparent jurisdiction of the Family\n\nCourt; (ii)\nprobation intake\nadvises the persons seeking to originate the court proceeding that a petition\nmay be filed any time prior to or during the adjustment period; (iii)\nthe potential petitioner, the potential\nrespondent and other interested persons, including the victim or injured\nperson, if made a part of the adjustment process, all understand that such\nprocess and any agreement derived therein is entirely voluntary and such\npersons agree to proceed with the adjustment process; (iv)\nit appears to probation intake that the\ncase can be adjusted within the time periods required by The Family Court Act\nand the uniform Family Court rules; (v) all circumstances in determining whether\nor not the case is suitable for adjustment under the provisions of The Family\n\nCourt Act and the uniform Family Court rules have been considered; and\n(vi)\n\nThe Family Court Act, the\nuniform Family Court rules, a court order, or this Part do not exclude the case\nfrom an adjustment. (b) Excluding nonsuitable cases from\nadjustment based upon lack of jurisdiction and designation as information only: (1)\n\nCases shall be excluded from any\nopportunity for adjustment where the subject of the case is outside the scope\nof The Family Court Act or where the court otherwise does not appear to have\njurisdiction over the case. All other cases which are not preliminary probation\nprocedure cases shall be excluded from any opportunity for adjustment where\nprobation intake does not render intake services although such case is within\nthe jurisdiction of the Family Court. (2)\n\nWhere is appears to probation intake that\nthe court would not have jurisdiction over the case, and such case is thereby\nexcluded from any opportunity for adjustment, the potential petitioner shall be\ninformed by probation intake that it is declining to adjust the case for that\nreason and that a petition may be filed with the court in order to test the\nquestion of jurisdiction. All excluded cases shall be designated as\ninformation-only cases and do not necessitate the opening of a case file; however, a numerical count shall, at the minimum, be maintained. (Information\ngiven over the telephone about a matter within the scope of the act, where an\nofficial case file is not opened, shall be recorded as information\nonly.)\n(c) Excluding\nsuitable cases from adjustment based upon exclusionary criteria: (1)\n\nExcept as provided in the previous\nsubdivision, all other cases shall be excluded from any opportunity for\nadjustment only whenever one or more of the below-listed exclusionary criteria\nare present. When a case is so excluded from any opportunity for adjustment, the potential petitioner shall be advised that a petition may be filed with the\ncourt. A record shall be maintained whenever a case is excluded from any\nopportunity for adjustment. (2)\n\nThe\nexclusionary criteria are as follows: (i) Cases arising under article 4 of the Family Court Act: (a) the potential petitioner insists upon\naccess to the court and declines to participate in the adjustment\nprocess; (b) the potential\npetitioner has secured or insists on securing an order of protection including\na temporary order of protection; (c) the potential respondent insists upon\naccess to the court, declines or is unavailable to participate in the\nadjustment process; (d) it appears\nto the probation service that a voluntary agreement will not result during the\nadjustment process; and\n(e) additional written criteria provided by the probation director requires an\nimmediate referral for petition. (ii)\n\nCases arising under article 8 of the\n\nFamily Court Act: (a) the potential\npetitioner insists upon access to the court and declines to participate in the\nadjustment process; (b) the\npotential petitioner has secured or wishes to secure an order of protection\nincluding a temporary order of protection; (c) the potential respondent insists upon\naccess to the court, declines or is unavailable to participate in the\nadjustment process; (d) the person\nseeking relief wishes to commence a criminal proceeding. (A person wishing to\ncommence a criminal proceeding would not file a petition, but would be referred\nto the proper official for the filing of an accusatory instrument); (e) it appears to probation intake that the\npotential respondent may inflict or threaten to inflict series physical injury\nto the person seeking relief or any other member of the same family or\nhousehold if the filing of a petition is delayed; (f) it appears to probation intake that the\nconduct which is the basis for a family offense complaint will not cease as a\nresult of any attempt to adjust the complaint; and\n(g) additional written criteria provided by a\nprobation director requires an immediate referral for petition. (d) Criteria\nfor determining when a suitable case is adjusted. (1)\n\nCases shall be considered adjusted based\nupon the below-listed criteria: (i) where the\npotential petitioner and the potential respondent reach a voluntary agreement\nthat is filed with the court in a case arising under article 4 of The Family\n\nCourt Act, or achieve a resolution of the complaint or issues raised in the\ncomplaint; (ii)\nwhere probation\nintake in a case arising under article 8 of The Family Court Act has received\nno other family offense complaints against the potential respondent during the\nadjustment process, and either a voluntary written agreement between the person\nseeking relief and the potential respondent to cease the offensive conduct has\nbeen filed with the court, or the person seeking relief and the potential\nrespondent have resolved the complaint through conciliation; and\n(iii)\nwhere the spouses in a matter arising\nunder article 9 of The Family Court Act have agreed to consult with a community\nagency or have agreed that further court intervention, or counseling, is not\nnecessary to alleviate their marital difficulties. (e) Termination of adjustment\nprocess and criteria. (1)\n\nWhere the\nadjustment process is terminated, based upon the below-listed criteria, the\npotential petitioner shall be notified that a petition may be filed. (2)\n\nCriteria for termination of the\nadjustment process are as follows: (i) the\npotential petitioner insists upon access to the court; (ii)\nthe potential petitioner has secured or\ninsists on securing an order of protection including a temporary order of\nprotection; (iii)\nthe potential\nrespondent fails to cooperate, or fulfill any voluntary agreement; (iv)\nit appears to probation intake that in a\ncase arising under article 4 of the Family Court Act there is no reasonable\nlikelihood that a voluntary agreement will be derived; (v) it appears to probation intake that the\nconduct forming the basis of a family offense complaint will not cease, or the\npotential respondent may inflict or threaten to inflict serious physical injury\nupon the person seeking relief in the family offense case or upon any other\nmember of the same family or household, or the potential respondent in the\nfamily offense case may threaten to inflict physical injury on the person\nseeking relief or any other member of the same family or household; (vi)\nthose acts or activities agreed upon in\nthe adjustment process have not been completed, are incomplete in their\nperformance, or have been completed unsuccessfully; and\n(vii)\nadditional written criteria provided by\na probation director require an immediate referral for petition.
