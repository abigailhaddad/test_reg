  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 3.15 - Water supply-item 7p\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Water for\nmilk plant purposes is from an adequate supply, properly located, protected and\noperated. It shall be easily accessible and of a safe, sanitary\nquality. (b) The water supply is\napproved as safe by the State water control authority and in the case of\nindividual water systems, it shall contain an MPN (most probable number of\ncoliform organisms) of less than 2.2/100 milliliters by the multiple tube\nfermentation technique or less than 1/100 milliliter by the membrane filter\ntechnique. (c) There is no\ncross-connection between the safe water supply and any unsafe or questionable\nwater supply, or any source of pollution through which the safe water supply\nmight become contaminated. A connection between the water supply piping and a\nmake-up tank (such as for cooling or condensing), unless protected by an air\ngap or effective backflow preventor, constitutes a violation of this\nrequirement. (d) Condensing water\nfor milk evaporators, and water used to produce vacuum and/or to condense\nvapors in vacuum heat processing equipment, is from a source complying with\nsubdivision (b) of this section, provided that, when approved by the\ncommissioner, water from sources not complying with subdivision (b) may be used\nwhen the evaporator or vacuum heat equipment is constructed and operated to\npreclude contamination of such equipment or its contents by condensing water or\nby water used to produce vacuum. Means of preventing such contamination are: (1)\nuse of a surface-type condenser in which\nthe condensing water is physically separated from the vapors and condensate; or\n(2)\nuse of reliable safeguards\nto prevent the overflow of condensing water from the condenser into the\nevaporator. Such safeguards include a barometric leg extending at least 35 feet\nvertically from the invert of the outgoing condensing waterline to the free\nlevel at which the leg discharges, or a safety shutoff valve, located on the\nwater feed line to the condenser, automatically actuated by a control which\nwill shut off the inflowing water when the water level rises above a\npredetermined point in the condenser. This valve may be actuated by water, air\nor electricity, and shall be designed so that failure of the primary motivating\npower will automatically stop the flow of water into the condenser. (e) Condensing water for all milk\nevaporators, complying with subdivision (b) of this section, and water\nreclaimed from milk or milk products, may be reused when all necessary means of\nprotection are afforded and it has been inspected and approved by the\ncommissioner's representative. (f) New individual water supplies and water supply systems, which have been\nrepaired or otherwise become contaminated, are disinfected before being placed\nin use. The supply shall be made free of the disinfectant by pumping to waste\nbefore any sample for bacteriological testing shall be collected. (g) Samples for bacteriological testing of\nindividual water supplies are taken upon the initial aproval of the physical\nstructure, each six months thereafter, and when any repair or alteration of the\nwater supply system has been made. Bacteriological examinations shall be\nconducted in a laboratory acceptable to the commissioner. (h) Current records of water tests shall be\nkept on file by the permittee. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n3.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
