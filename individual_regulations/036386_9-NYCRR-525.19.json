  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 525.19 - Crimes committed by family members\n\nState Regulations\nA victim who is injured as result of a crime committed by a\nfamily member will be eligible to receive an award unless the office finds that\nthe person responsible for the crime will derive substantial economic benefit\nor unjust enrichment. A determination that a family member will derive\nsubstantial economic benefit or unjust enrichment will be based upon a\nconsideration of the offender's access to the award, the victim's cooperation\nwith the criminal justice system, and the availability of collateral\nresources. (a) Access. It shall be\ndetermined whether the offender will have access to any award to the victim\nand/or whether a substantial portion of the money will be primarily used by or\nfor the benefit of the offender. (1)\n\nWhen an\naward is made directly to a victim it must be determined that the offender will\nnot substantially benefit from such award. Factors to be considered in\ndetermining whether substantial benefit will be derived include: (i) whether a significant portion of the\naward will pay for the offender's living expenses, or be otherwise used for his\nor her benefit; and\n(ii)\nthe needs\nof the victim and other family members in comparison to any benefit to be\nderived by the offender. The fact that the offender may benefit incidentally\nfrom such award will not support a determination of substantial economic\nbenefit or unjust enrichment where such award is essential to the well-being of\nthe victim and other innocent and dependent family members, particularly in\nregard to their living expenses. (2)\n\nThe fact that the offender is present in\nthe household will be a factor to be considered but shall not preclude an\naward. (3)\n\nWhenever possible\npayments will be made directly to third-party providers. (b) Cooperation. The victim must file a\npolice report and be willing to cooperate with the criminal justice system or\nin a family court proceeding. (c) Collateral resources. In domestic violence claims as in any other claim, collateral resources available to the victim, including those from the\noffender, must be considered and deducted from any award. If, however, the\noffender fails to meet legal responsibilities to pay restitution or to provide\nfor the medical needs of a family member, or if the offender impedes payment of\ninsurance that may be available to cover a claimant's out-of-pocket losses, the\noffice may make an award to cover such losses. The offender will remain liable\nfor such losses pursuant to the office's subrogation right. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
