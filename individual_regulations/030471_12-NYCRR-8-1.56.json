  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 8-1.56 - Electrical contact\n\nState Regulations\n(See definition §\n8-1.1\n)\n(a) The functioning of an electric contact to\nprevent the movement of the car shall not be dependent upon the closing of an\nelectric circuit. (b) Electric\ncontacts shall be designed so that they are directly opened by a lever or other\ndevice attached to and operated by the door or gate. Contacts employing\nsprings, gravity or a combination of the two forces, may be used when approved\nby the Industrial Commissioner if the device is found to be safe, practical and\nreliable. These forces, however, are not considered desirable if they are\narranged so that their failure would create an unsafe condition. Note: Helical springs are considered particularly\nundesirable. (c) The force\nor forces employed to open the contact shall be such that even without\nlubrication of the mechanism the intended functioning of the electric contact\nshall be completely performed. (d) Contacts shall be so designed and installed as to prevent, so far as possible, being tampered with or intentionally rendered inoperative (except as noted in\n§\n8-1.57\ncovering emergency\nrelease). (See also §§\n8-1.6, 8-1.58, 8- 1.59.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n8-1.56\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
