(b) A social services district\nmay not reduce or terminate public assistance to an individual or an individual\nand the family of such individual based on a refusal of the individual to\ncomply with applicable work requirements if the individual is a custodial\nparent or caretaker relative of a child under 13 years of age and the\nindividual has a demonstrated inability, as determined by the social services\ndistrict, to obtain child care needed to comply with such work requirements due\nto the following reasons: (1)\nunavailability\nof appropriate and accessible child care within a reasonable distance from the\nindividual's home or work site; (2)\nunavailability or unsuitability of informal child care by a relative or under\nother arrangements; and\n(3)\nunavailability of appropriate and affordable formal child care\narrangements.

(d) It is the responsibility of the parent or\ncaretaker relative to locate child care for the applicable child(ren) needed to\ncomply with such work requirements. (e) If such parent or caretaker relative\ncannot locate the needed child care on his or her own, the parent or caretaker\nrelative must inform the social services district of his or her efforts to\nlocate such care and request additional assistance in locating care. (f) When a parent or caretaker relative\nrequests assistance from the social services district in locating child care\ndue to an inability to locate the needed child care on his or her own, the\nsocial services district must: (1)\nassist the\nfamily by referring the parent or caretaker relative to the child care resource\nand referral agency funded under title five-B of article six of the Social\n\nServices Law that is responsible for the areas in which the parent or caretaker\nrelative lives and/or would be expected to work or to another appropriate child\ncare referral agency; and/or\n(2)\nprovide the parent or caretaker relative with a list of names, addresses and\ntelephone numbers of eligible providers.

(k) A parent or caretaker relative who has\nbeen excused from the applicable work requirements due to a demonstrated\ninability to locate needed child care for his or her applicable child(ren) will\nbe excused from the work requirements only for so long as that demonstrated\ninability continues to exist.
