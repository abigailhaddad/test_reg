Tit. 21 § 105.3 - Prohibited advertising devices\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The following are prohibited: (1)\nadvertising devices which advertise\nactivities that are illegal under Federal, State or municipal laws or\nregulation; (2)\nobsolete\nadvertising devices; (3)\nadvertising devices not securely affixed in place; (4)\nadvertising devices which purport to be\nor are imitations of or resemble or are likely to be construed as official\ntraffic control devices or railroad signs or signals, or which attempt to\ndirect or regulate the movement of traffic, or which hide from view or\ninterfere with the effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any\nrailroad sign or signal; (5)\nadvertising devices which prevent the driver of a vehicle from having a clear\nand unobstructed view; (6)\nadvertising devices which contain, include or are illuminated by any flashing, intermittent or moving light or lights; (7)\nadvertising devices which permit beams or\nrays of light to be directed at any portion of the Thruway system, or which\ncause glare and tend to interfere with any driver's operation of a vehicle on\nthe Thruway system; (8)\nadvertising\ndevices which move or have any animated or moving parts; (9)\nadvertising devices on trees, rocks or\nother natural features; (10)\nadvertising devices which, based on established policy or in the judgment of\nthe Thruway Authority, constitute a traffic hazard; and\n(11)\noff-premises devices, except that the\nfollowing off-premises devices may be permitted under this Part: devices\nlocated in areas within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the right-of- way which\nare zoned industrial or commercial under authority of State law and which lie\nwithin the boundaries of cities having a population greater than 250,000, provided that no off- premises advertising device shall be permitted to be\nmaintained within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the Niagara section\nright-of-way within the city of Buffalo north of Elm Street. (b) Whenever an off-premises\nadvertising device prohibited under subdivision (a) of this section, but lawful\nunder prior law, is located in areas within 660 feet of the nearest edge of the\nright-of-way of Interstate 287, and construction of same at its present\nlocation commenced with respect to Interstate 287 on or before April 1, 1991, the same may continue to be maintained, subject to permitting under this Part, for a reasonable period not to exceed the longer of two years from commencement\nof construction or the period which the owner of the advertising device can\ndemonstrate is necessary to avoid substantial financial loss. In determining\nwhat constitutes substantial financial loss, the authority may consider such\nfactors as initial capital investment, investment realization at the time of\nthe permit application, life expectancy of the investment, the existence or\nnon-existence of a lease obligation, and existence of a contingency clause\npermitting termination of the lease. Failure to apply for a permit under this\n\nPart shall constitute presumptive evidence that immediate removal of the\noff-premises advertising device will cause no substantial economic\nloss.
