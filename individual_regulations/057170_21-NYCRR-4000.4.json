  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 4000.4 - Fees for services of arbitrators\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Many panel arbitrators have full-time\noccupations in legal, engineering, consultation and other fields and\nprofessions and a few are full-time professional arbitrators. Panel arbitrators\nwhen selected by the parties receive a fee for their services, paid for by the\nparties. The fee is established by the arbitrator on a per diem or on a case\nbasis. The parties make payment directly to the arbitrator and not through the\n\nState Mediation Board. There are no charges by the board to the parties for the\nuse of the services of the board. (b) In cases where the board (or its\ndesignated representative) assigns a case to a staff mediator to arbitrate the\ndispute, this decision is entirely up to the board. There is no charge to the\nparties for this service. However, priority is given to mediation\nactivities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n4000.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
