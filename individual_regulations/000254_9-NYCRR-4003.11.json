Tit. 9 § 4003.11 - Increased retention for capital improvements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purposes of this section, capital\nimprovement, as defined in section 237 of the Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and\n\nBreeding Law, is any addition to, replacement of or remodeling of the physical\nplant, structures and equipment, owned or leased by a licensed track that is\nused or is to be used by such track in connection with the conduct of horse\nrace meetings, and shall include improvements to land but not land\nitself. (b) A thoroughbred track, other than a nonprofit thoroughbred track, may elect upon 30 days' written\nnotice to the commission (with a copy thereof to the State Tax Commission) to\nwithhold, in addition to any other amounts required by this section, one\npercent of the total deposits in pools resulting from regular and multiple\nbets; provided, however, that any thoroughbred track withholding pursuant to\nthis subdivision shall use such one percent exclusively for capital\nimprovements, as defined in subdivision (a) of this section, subject to the\nfollowing provisions: (1)\n\nAll amounts\nwithheld by the track on and after such 30-day written notice to the\ncommission, as well as all monies paid over to the track by off-track betting\ncorporations from additional withholding mandated upon such corporations\npursuant to section 527 of such law, shall be deposited in a segregated\ninterest-bearing account designated \"Retention for Capital Construction\"\naccount. A track may withdraw monies from such account for the purposes of\ninvestment in segregated certificates of deposit or government securities, provided that the entire proceeds of such investments, including interest or\ndividends, are redeposited in such account within two years of such\nwithdrawal. (2)\n\nWithin 30 days of\nthe enactment of this rule (or if a track shall hereafter make such election, then with its notice of election to the commission), and annually thereafter, with its license application, each such electing track shall furnish the\ncommission with a complete description of all capital improvements that it\nplans to make, together with the estimated cost thereof, the estimated\ninception and completion date, and how such capital improvement will be\nacquired or accomplished. Such capital improvements as are to be paid for from\nfunds from the \" Retention for Capital Construction\" account shall be so\ndesignated, together with estimated dates and amounts of withdrawals, and a\nstatement as to how such improvement will further the objectives of the law to\nincrease attendance or betting handle. (3)\nA permit from the commission shall be\nrequired for all capital improvements to be financed from such \"Retention for\n\nCapital Construction\" account and, if such capital improvement shall involve\nconstruction or alteration of plant and structures, plans and specifications\nsatisfactory to a consulting engineer or architect designated by the commission\nshall be furnished as a prerequisite to such purpose. (4)\n\nNo monies may be withdrawn from such\naccount except for investments permitted pursuant to subdivision (c) of this\nsection, or in payment for capital improvements for which a permit has been\nissued by the commission. (5)\n\nWithin 30 days of the end of the calendar year, such track shall submit a\nreport to the commission, showing the balance of the account at the beginning\nof the year, the total added and the total withdrawn during the year, and the\nbalance at the end of the year listing each bank account and investment. The\nreport shall also describe the progress of planned capital construction, together with an itemized list of the withdrawals from the \"Retention for\n\nCapital Construction\" account, the payees of such withdrawals, and copies of\nall billings and vouchers supporting such withdrawals. (6)\n\nThe commission on its own initiative may\nrequire a track to make such capital improvements as it may deem\nnecessary. (7)\n\nThe commission, at\nany time, may cause a track to be audited concerning its compliance with this\nsection. (c) A track\nmaking such election may terminate such election upon 30 days' notice to the\ncommission. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
