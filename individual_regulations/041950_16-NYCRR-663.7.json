  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 663.7 - Standard practices for establishing and maintaining continuing property records\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Accounting\narea. (1)\n\nThe continuing property record, as\nrelated to each primary plant account, shall be established and maintained by\nsubaccount for each accounting area. An accounting area is the smallest\nterritory of the company for which accounting records of investment are\nmaintained for all plant accounts within the area. Areas already established\nfor administrative, accounting, valuation, or other purposes may be adopted for\nthis purpose when appropriate. In no case shall the boundaries of accounting\nareas cross either State lines or boundaries prescribed by the\ncommission. (2)\n\nIn determining the\nlimit of each area, consideration shall be given to the quantities of property, construction conditions, operating districts, county and township lines, taxing\ndistrict boundaries, city limits, and other political or geographical limits, in order that the area adopted may have maximum adaptability, within the\nconfines of practicability, for both the company's purpose and those of\n\nFederal, State, and municipal authorities. (b) Property record units. (1)\n\nIn each of the established accounting\nareas, the property record units which are to be maintained in the continuing\nproperty record shall be set forth separately, classified by size and type with\nthe amount of original cost (or other appropriate book cost) associated with\nsuch units. Such units shall apply to only the regulated portion of this system\nof accounts. (2)\n\nWhen it is found\nnecessary to revise this list because of the addition of units used in\nproviding new types of service, or new units resulting from improvements in\ntechnology, or because of the grouping or elimination of units which no longer\nmerit separate recognition as property record units, one copy of such changes\nshall be submitted to the commission. Upon appropriate showing by the company, the commission may specifically exempt the company from these filing\nrequirements. (3)\n\nThe continuing\nproperty record shall reveal the description, location, date of placement, the\nessential details of construction, and the original cost (note also subdivision\n[c] of this section) of the property record units. The continuing property\nrecord and other underlying records of construction costs shall be so\nmaintained that, upon retirement of one or more retirement units or of minor\nitems without replacement when not included in the costs of retirement units, the actual cost or a reasonably accurate estimate of the cost of the plant\nretired can be determined. (c) Methods of determining original cost of\nproperty record units. The original cost of the property record units shall be\ndetermined by analyses of the construction costs incurred as shown by\ncompletion reports and other data, accumulated in the respective construction\nwork orders or authorizations. Costs shall be allocated to and associated with\nthe property record units to facilitate accounting for retirements. The\noriginal cost of property record units shall be determined by unit\nidentification or averaging as described below: (1)\n\nUnit identification. Cost shall be\nidentified and maintained by specific location for property record units\ncontained within certain regulated plant accounts or account groupings such as\nland, buildings, central office assets, motor vehicles, garage work equipment\nand furniture. In addition, units involved in any unusual or special type of\nconstruction shall be recorded by their specific location costs (note also\nsubparagraph [2][ii] of this subdivision). (2)\n\nAveraging. (i) Average costs may be developed for plant\nconsisting of a large number of similar units such as terminal equipment, poles, wire, cable, cable terminals, conduit, furniture, and work equipment. Units of similar size and type within each specified accounting area and\nregulated plant account may be grouped. Each such average cost shall be set\nforth in the continuing property record of the units with which it is\nassociated. (ii)\n\nThe averaging of\ncosts permitted under the provisions of the foregoing paragraph is restricted\nto plant installed in a particular vintage or band of years, incurred within an\naccounting area. This paragraph does not permit the inclusion of the cost of\nunits involved in any unusual or special type of construction. The units\ninvolved in such unusual or special type of construction shall be recorded at\ncost by location. (d) Estimates. In cases where the actual\noriginal cost of property cannot be ascertained, such as pricing an inventory\nfor the initial entry of a continuing property record or the pricing of an\nacquisition for which a continuing property record has not been maintained, the\noriginal cost may be estimated. Any estimated original cost shall be consistent\nwith the accounting practices in effect at the time the property was\nconstructed. (e) Identification of\nproperty record units. There shall be shown in the continuing property record\nor in record supplements thereof, a complete description of the property record\nunits in such detail as to identify such units. The description shall include\nthe identification of the work order under which constructed, the year of\ninstallation (unless not determinable per subdivision [d] of this section), the\nspecific location of the property within each accounting area in such manner\nthat it can be readily spot-checked for proof of physical existence, the\naccounting company's number or designation, and any other description used in\nconnection with the determination of the original cost. Descriptions of units\nof similar size and type shall follow prescribed groupings. (f) Reinstalled units. When units to which\naverage costs are not applied, i.e., specific and fixed location units, are\nremoved or retired and subsequently reinstalled, the date when the unit was\nfirst charged to the appropriate plant account shall, when required for\nadequate service life studies and reasonably accurate retirement accounting, be\nshown in addition to the date of reinstallation. (g) Age and service life of property. The\ncontinuing property record shall disclose the age of existing property and the\nsupporting records shall disclose the service life of property\nretired. (h) Reference to sources\nof information. There shall be shown by appropriate reference the source of all\nentries. All drawings, computations, and other detailed records which support\nquantities and costs or estimated costs shall be retained as a part of or in\nsupport of the continuing property record. (i) Jointly owned property. (1)\n\nWith respect to jointly owned property, there shall be shown in the continuing property record or records supplemental\nthereto: (i) the identity of all joint owners; and\n(ii)\nthe percentage owned by\nthe accounting company. (2)\n\nWhen regulated plant is constructed under\narrangements for joint ownership, the amount received by the constructing\ncompany from the other joint owner or owners shall be credited as a reduction\nof the gross cost of the plant in place. (3)\n\nWhen a sale of a part interest in\nregulated plant is made, the fractional interest sold shall be treated as a\nretirement and the amount received shall be treated as salvage. The continuing\nproperty record or records supplemental thereto shall be so maintained as to\nidentify separately retirements of this nature from physical retirements of\njointly owned plant. (4)\n\nIf jointly\nowned regulated property is substantial in relation to the total of the same\nkind of regulated property owned wholly by the company, such jointly owned\nregulated property shall be appropriately segregated in the continuing property\nrecord. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n663.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
