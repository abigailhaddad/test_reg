  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 561.8 - Prior period items\n\nState Regulations\n(a) As a general\nrule, items relating to transactions which occurred prior to the current\ncalendar year but were not recorded in the books of account shall be included\nin the same accounts in which they would have been recorded had the item been\nrecorded in the proper period. Such items relate to events or transactions\nwhich occurred in a prior period or periods, the accounting effects of which\ncould not be determined with reasonable assurance at the time, usually because\nof major uncertainty then existing. When the amount of a prior period item is\nrelatively so large its inclusion for a single month would distort the accounts\nfor that month, the amount may be distributed in equal amounts to the accounts\nfor the current and remaining months of the calendar year. However, if the\namount of any prior period item is so large that the company believes its\ninclusion in the income statement would seriously distort the net income for\nthe year, the company may request commission approval to record the amount in\naccount 439, Adjustments to Retained Earnings. Such a request must be\naccompanied by adequate justification. (b) Treatment as prior period adjustments\nshould not be applied to the normal, recurring corrections and adjustments\nwhich are the natural result of the use of estimates inherent in the accounting\nprocess. For example, changes in the estimated remaining lives of fixed assets\naffect the computed amounts of depreciation, but these changes should be\nconsidered prospective in nature and not prior period adjustments. Similarly, relatively insignificant adjustments of provisions for liabilities (including\nincome taxes) made in prior periods should be considered recurring items to be\nreflected in operations of the current period. Some uncertainties, for example\nthose relating to the realization of assets (collectibility of accounts\nreceivable, ultimate recovery of deferred costs of realizability of inventories\nor other assets), would not qualify for prior period adjustment treatment, since economic events subsequent to the date of the financial statements must\nof necessity enter into the elimination of any previously-existing uncertainty. Therefore, the effects of such matters are considered to be elements in the\ndetermination of net income for the period in which the uncertainty is\neliminated. (See account 439, Adjustments to Retained Earnings.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n561.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
