  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 16, Appendices, app 14-F\nState Regulations\nQUALIFICATION OF WELDERS FOR CERTAIN DISTRIBUTION\nMAINS AND SERVICE LINES\nI. Basic test. The test is made on pipe 12\ninches or less in diameter. The test weld must be made with the pipe in a\nhorizontal fixed position so that the test weld includes at least one section\nof overhead position welding. The beveling, root opening, and other details\nmust conform to the specifications of the procedure under which the welder is\nbeing qualified. Upon completion, the test weld is cut into four coupons and\nsubjected to a root bend test. If, as a result of this test, two or more of the\nfour coupons develop a crack in the weld material, or between the weld material\nand base metal, that is more than 1/8-inch long in any direction, the weld is\nunacceptable. Cracks that occur on the corner of the specimen during testing\nare not considered. A welder who successfully passes a butt-weld qualification\ntest under this section shall be qualified to weld on all pipe diameters less\nthan or equal to 12 inches. II. Additional tests for welders of service line connections to mains. A service\nline connection fitting is welded to a pipe section with the same diameter as a\ntypical main. The weld is made in the same position as it is made in the field. The weld is unacceptable if it shows a serious undercutting or if it has rolled\nedges. The weld is tested by attempting to break the fitting off the run pipe. The weld is unacceptable if it breaks and shows incomplete fusion, overlap, or\npoor penetration at the junction of the fitting and run pipe. III. Periodic tests for welders of small\nservice lines. Two samples of the welder's work, each about 8 inches long with\nthe weld located approximately in the center, are cut from steel service line\nand tested as follows: One sample is centered in a guided bend testing machine and\nbent to the contour of the die for a distance of 2 inches on each side of the\nweld. If the sample shows any breaks or cracks after removal from the bending\nmachine, it is unacceptable. The ends of the second sample are flattened and the entire\njoint subjected to a tensile strength test. If failure occurs adjacent to oil\nin the weld metal, the weld is unacceptable. If a tensile strength testing\nmachine is not available, this sample must also pass the bending test\nprescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. tit. 16, Appendices, app\n14-F\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
