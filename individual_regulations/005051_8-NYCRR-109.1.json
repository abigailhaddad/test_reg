  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 109.1 - Observance of special holidays\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Education Law (section 802, subdivision 2) requires the\nobservance in public schools of Lincoln's Birthday, Washington's Birthday, Memorial Day and Flag Day. To these should be added Veterans' Day, Columbus Day\nand Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Each school should observe these holidays in\nits own way. While the original purpose of both Memorial Day and Veterans' Day\nwas to honor those who have given their lives for their country, special\nexercises or study for these days may properly be directed, in the one case, to\ncreating a better and deeper understanding of the American Union; and in the\nother to keeping alive the ideal of world peace. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8\n§\n109.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
