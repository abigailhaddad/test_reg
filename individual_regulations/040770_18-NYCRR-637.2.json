Tit. 18 § 637.2 - Conditions for reimbursement for food stamp costs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Costs related to the provision of food\nstamps to eligible individuals which are required to be allocated or\ndistributed by regulation or direction of the department shall be claimed as\nrequired by such regulations or directions. Costs shall be allocated or\ndistributed in accordance with the requirements set forth in department\nregulations pertaining to the allocation of expenditures for public assistance\nand care. (b) Except as otherwise\ndirected by the department, amounts expended for food stamp activities, including enforcement and fraud detection activities, for which an enhanced\nrate of Federal participation may be claimed by the department shall be claimed\nby the district in a manner that will result in the receipt of such additional\n\nFederal participation. Such enhanced reimbursement shall be treated in a manner\nthat permits the State to claim the greatest amount of Federal participation\nfor a local district's food stamp activity expenditures which are reimbursed by\nthe State. (c) Except as otherwise\nspecifically authorized by Federal or State law or regulation or as\nspecifically directed by the department, no amounts for food stamp expenditures\nshall be reimbursable if such amounts were paid directly to the individual\neligible to receive food stamps or such individual's representative. (d) Any adjustment of claims for\nreimbursement, including adjustment to claims as a result of recoveries or\ncollections, shall be made in accordance with procedures, instructions or\ndirections of the department. (e) Amounts claimed as food stamp expenditures shall be reduced in accordance with\ninstructions of the department to reflect any penalty or other charges accruing\nto the district. (f) Any claims for\nreimbursement for food stamp expenditures which were not fully reimbursed as\nclaimed and which were properly made at the time they were originally claimed, may be reclaimed pursuant to this Part, provided that the revised claim is\ntimely and an adjustment is simultaneously submitted to the department to\nreduce the original claim.
