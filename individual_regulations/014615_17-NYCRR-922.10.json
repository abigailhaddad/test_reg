  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 922.10 - Staybolt testing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Time of\ntesting rigid bolts. All staybolts shall be tested at least once each month. Staybolts shall also be tested immediately after every hydrostatic\ntest. (b) Method of testing rigid\nbolts. The inspector must tap each bolt from the firebox side and determine the\nbroken bolts from the sound or from the vibration of the sheet. If staybolt\ntests are made when the boiler is filled with water, there must be not less\nthan 50 pounds pressure on the boiler. Should the boiler not be under pressure, the test may be made after draining all the water from the boiler, in which\ncase the vibration of the sheet will indicate any unsoundness. The latter test\nis preferable. (c) (1)\n\nMethod of testing flexible staybolts with\ncaps. Except as provided in paragraph (2) hereof, all staybolts having caps\nover the outer ends shall have the caps removed at least once every two years\nand the bolts and sleeves examined for breakage. Each time the hydrostatic test\nis applied the hammer test required by subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section\nshall be made while the boiler is under hydrostatic pressure not less than the\nallowed working pressure. (2)\n\nWhen\nall flexible staybolts with which any boiler is equipped are provided with a\ntelltale hole not less than 3/16 inch nor more than 7/32 inch in diameter, extending the entire length of the bolt and into the head not less than one\nthird of its diameter, and these holes are protected from becoming closed by\nrust and corrosion by copper plating or other approved method, and are opened\nand tested, each time the hydrostatic test is applied, with an electric or\nother instrument that will positively indicate when the telltale holes are open\ntheir entire length, the caps will not be required to be removed. When this\ntest is completed the hydrostatic test must be applied and all staybolts\nremoved which show leakage through the telltale hole. The inner ends of the telltale holes must be kept closed\nwith a fireproof porous material that will exclude foreign matter and permit\nleakage of steam or water, if the bolt is broken or fractured, into the\ntelltale hole. When this test is completed the ends of the telltale holes shall\nbe closed with material of different color than that removed and a record kept\nof colors used. (3)\n\nFirebox\nsheets must be carefully examined at least once every month for mud burn, bulging and indications of broken staybolts. (4)\n\nStaybolt caps shall be removed or any of\nthe above tests made whenever the commissioner's inspector or the operator's\ninspector considers it desirable in order to thoroughly determine the condition\nof staybolts or staybolt sleeves. (d) Method of testing flexible staybolts\nwithout caps. Flexible staybolts which do not have caps shall be tested at\nleast once each month the same as rigid bolts. Each time a hydrostatic test is\napplied such staybolt test shall be made while the boiler is under hydrostatic\npressure not less than the allowed working pressure, and proper notation of\nsuch test shall be made on the certificate of inspection. (e) Broken staybolts. No boiler shall be\nallowed to remain in service when there are two adjacent staybolts broken or\nplugged in any part of the firebox or combustion chamber, nor when three or\nmore are broken or plugged in a circle four feet in diameter, nor when five or\nmore are broken or plugged in the entire boiler. (f) Telltale holes. All staybolts shorter\nthan eight inches, except flexible bolts, shall have telltale holes 3/16 inch\nin diameter and not less than one and one-quarter inches deep in the outer end. These holes must be kept open at all times. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n922.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
