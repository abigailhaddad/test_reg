  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 260.1 - Application of good behavior allowances\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The opportunity to earn good behavior\nallowances offers inmates a tangible reward for positive efforts made during\nincarceration. (b) For those\ninmates serving indeterminate sentences imposed for crimes committed prior to\n\nSeptember 1, 1967, good behavior allowances shorten the amount of time to be\nserved prior to parole consideration. (c) For all inmates serving determinate or\nindeterminate sentences (other than life sentences) who are not granted parole\nor a reparole, but who nevertheless have performed well within the correctional\nfacilities, good behavior allowances can be used to obtain release under\nsupervision and to demonstrate prior to expiration of the term of the sentence\nthat they can follow acceptable behavior patterns in the community as well as\nin a correctional facility. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n260.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
