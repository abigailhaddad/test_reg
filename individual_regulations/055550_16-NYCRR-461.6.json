  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 461.6 - Delayed items\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The term\ndelayed items means items relating to transactions which occurred prior to the\ncurrent calendar year but which were not recorded in the books of account in\nthe prior year. (b) Delayed items\nshall be charged or credited to the same accounts which would have been charged\nor credited had the items not been delayed; provided, that when the amount of a\ndelayed item is relatively so large that its inclusion in the accounts for a\nsingle month would seriously distort the accounts it may be distributed in\nequal amounts to the accounts for the current and remaining months of the\ncalendar year. If the amount of any delayed item is relatively so large that\nits inclusion in the accounts for a single year would seriously distort the\naccounts, the utility shall distribute the amount to the appropriate surplus\naccount. (c) Records shall be\nmaintained so that the utility will be able to list and describe in the annual\nreport for each year each delayed item amounting to $100 or more entered in the\n\nIncome Account during that year. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n461.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
