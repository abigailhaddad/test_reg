Each year more than 2,000 persons are killed on our highways and several\nhundred thousand more are seriously injured. In addition, wage losses alone\namount to billions of dollars annually, and hospital care for automobile crash\nvictims costs New Yorkers additional tens of millions of dollars each\nyear. Both the private and public sectors in the State have a\nsignificant interest in reducing tragic personal and property losses\nattributable to traffic accidents and have demonstrated a willingness to\ncooperate with the agencies of State government for the promotion of highway\nsafety. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the\n\nLaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: I.

The Council shall report its recommendations to the Governor by\n\nDecember 15, 1982. Signed: Hugh L.
