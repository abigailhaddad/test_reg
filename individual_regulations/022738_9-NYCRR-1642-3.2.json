  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-3.2 - General ledger\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A general\nledger shall be maintained by the local agency to control and classify all\nfinancial transactions pertaining to each State-aided project. It shall be\nconfined to the accounts designated as general ledger accounts in Part 1641, Account Classification. This classification is sufficiently self-contained and\nembraces all accounts necessary for the preparation of financial statements. Postings to the general ledger shall be made only from the journal vouchers and\nfrom the books of original entry, namely; cash disbursements-voucher register\nand cash receipts register. A trial balance of the general ledger (§\n1647-7.4\n) shall be taken monthly, but the individual accounts shall not be ruled off except as directed otherwise\nherein. (b) A separate ledger sheet\nshall be used for each account included in the classification of general ledger\naccounts. The heading of each ledger sheet shall contain the name of the local\nagency, the project number, the account number, and the description of the\naccount. (See Exhibit 3, Appendix S-8.) Separate ledger sheets may also be used\nto control the operations of each site included in a multiple development\nproject or in the alternative, a columnar analysis general ledger sheet may be\nused. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-3.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
