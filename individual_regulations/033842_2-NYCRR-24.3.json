  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 24.3 - Proper Filing of Initial Protests\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Proper filing of an initial protest depends on whether the public contracting\nentity has its own bid protest procedure and has provided bidders with proper\nnotice of such. Where the public contracting entity has a written protest\nprocedure and has provided notice of such procedure in the solicitation, a\nprotest shall be filed initially with the public contracting entity. However, an interested party may file an initial protest with the Bureau of Contracts in\naccordance with section\n24.4\nof this Part, after the public\ncontracting entity has made a contract award, if: 1. the public contracting entity has not\nprovided notice of its protest procedure in the solicitation; or\n2. the facts that would give rise to a\nprotest are not known to, and could not reasonably have been known to, an\ninterested party prior to the date by which a protest was required to be filed\nwith the public contracting entity. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n24.3\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register January 25, 2017/Volume XXXIX, Issue 04, eff. 1/25/2017\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
