  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 660.1 - Basis of the accounts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nfinancial accounts of a company are used to record, in monetary terms, the\nbasic transactions which occur. Certain natural groupings of these transactions\nare called (in different contexts) transaction cycles, business processes, functions or activities. The concept, however, is the same in each case; i.e., the natural groupings represent what happens within the company on a consistent\nand continuing basis. This repetitive nature of the natural groupings, over\nlong periods of time, lends an element of stability to the financial account\nstructure. (b) Within the\ntelecommunications industry companies, certain recurring functions (natural\ngroupings) do take place in the course of providing products and services to\ncustomers. These accounts reflect, to the extent feasible, those functions. For\nexample, the primary bases of the accounts containing the investment in\ntelecommunications plant are the functions performed by the assets. In\naddition, because of the anticipated effects of future innovations, the\ntelecommunications plant accounts are intended to permit technological\ndistinctions. Similarly, the primary bases of plant operations, customer\noperations and corporate operations expense accounts are the functions\nperformed by individuals. The revenue accounts, on the other hand, reflect a\nmarket perspective of natural groupings based primarily upon the products and\nservices purchased by customers. (c) In the course of developing the bases for\nthis account structure, several other alternatives were explored. It was, for\nexample, determined that, because of the variety and continual changing of\nvarious cost allocation mechanisms, the financial accounts of a company should\nnot reflect an a priori allocation of revenues, investments or expenses to\nproducts or services, jurisdictions or organizational structures. (Note also\nsection\n661.4\n[c]\nof this\n\nTitle.) It was also determined that costs (in the case of assets) should not be\nrecorded based solely upon physical attributes such as location, description or\nsize. (d) Care has been taken in\nthis account structure to avoid confusing a function with an organizational\nresponsibility, particularly as it relates to the expense accounts. Whereas in\nthe past, specific organizations may have performed specific functions, the\nfuture environment with its increasing mechanization and other changes will\nresult in entirely new or restructured organizations. Thus, any relationships\ndrawn between organizations and accounts would become increasingly meaningless\nwith the passage of time. (e) These\naccounts, then, are intended to reflect a functional and technological view of\nthe telecommunications industry. This view will provide a stable and consistent\nfoundation for the recording of financial data. (f) The financial data contained in the\naccounts, together with the detailed information contained in the underlying\nfinancial and other subsidiary records required by this commission, will\nprovide the information necessary to support separations, cost of service and\nmanagement reporting requirements. The basic account structure has been\ndesigned to remain stable as reporting requirements change. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n660.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
