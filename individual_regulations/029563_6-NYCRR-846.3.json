  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 846.3 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters Index Number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adopted\nfrom that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological\nsurvey series of reports on the watersheds of the State. The primary waters of\na drainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name\nor abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Lake Ontario watershed in 1939 and has been closely followed in connection\nwith the identification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the\ntime of its 1939 survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams and ponds not shown on the older maps but appearing\non the newer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Lake Ontario drainage basin may be illustrated\nas follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\n\nOnt. 0\n\nLake Ontario\n\nPrimary waters. Ont. 108\n\nIrondequoit Bay Outlet\n\nThe 108th tributary entering Lake Ontario numbered\nclockwise from the mouth at Tibbetts Point. Ont. 108-P 113\n\nIrondequoit Bay\n\nThe 113th pond, lake or reservoir encountered\nwithin the Lake Ontario watershed system. Ont. 108-P 113-3\n\nIrondequoit Creek\n\nThe 3rd tributary entering Irondequoit Bay\nprogressing clockwise from its outlet. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries shall mean any stream, lake, pond\nor other body of surface water which flows into any other stream, lake, pond or\nother body of surface water. Where no tributaries or subtributaries are\nmentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water designated by such waters index\nnumber; where tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned after the waters\nindex number, the specifically designated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water designated by such waters index\nnumber and all tributaries and subtributaries thereof, which are shown on the\nreference maps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\ngenerally known and which name may appear on the reference maps. In cases of\nspecifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to which\nthe unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as possible. (e) Description\nas appearing\nin table I shall mean a brief indication as to the location of the specifically\ndesignated waters. Entries may include designations of segments or sections of\nwaters to which a particular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also include any useful information pertinent to the classification\nor standards. (f) Map ref. no. as appearing in table I means map reference number and indicates\none or more of the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in\npart, on which the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are\nshown. Map 2 shows the continuity of the quadrangle maps used in this Part. (1)\n\nThe following maps were produced from\noriginal maps which may be procured through the Washington Distribution\n\nSection, Geological Survey. Map ref. no. Quadrangle name\n\nPublished by\n\nEdition\nH-9ne\n\nRochester East\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1935\nH-10nw\n\nWebster\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1952\nH-9se\n\nMendon Ponds\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1935\nH-10sw\n\nFairport\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1952\nH-10se\n\nMacedon\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1951\nJ-9ne\n\nHoneoye Falls\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1951\nJ-10nw\n\nVictor\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1951\n(g) Class\nas appearing in\ntable I and denoted by the letters A, B or C opposite each specifically\ndesignated waters, shall mean class A, B or C, as the case may be, as set forth\nin Part 701, supra. (h) Standards\nas appearing\nin table I, and denoted by the letter A, B or C opposite each specifically\ndesignated waters shall mean the standards of quality and purity established\nfor class A, B or C, as the case may be, as set forth in Part 701, supra. The symbol (T) after any class designation shall mean\nthat the designated waters are trout waters and that the dissolved oxygen\nspecification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol (TS) after any\nstandard designation shall mean that the designated waters are suitable for\ntrout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen specification for trout spawning\nwaters shall apply hereto. (i) All\nstreams or other bodies of water which appear as lines to indicate natural\nwaters on the reference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated\nin table I, shall be assigned the same classes and standards of quality and\npurity as the specifically designated waters to which they are directly\ntributary. (j) All streams or other\nbodies of water which are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be\nassigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except\nthat any continuous flowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference\nmaps shall have the same classification and assigned standards as the waters to\nwhich it is directly tributary. (k) The term\ntrout\nas used in this Part means any fish in the\nfollowing genera: \"Coregonus\", \"Oncorhynchus\", \"Prosopium\", \"Salmo\", \"Salvelinus\" and \"Thymallus\". Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
