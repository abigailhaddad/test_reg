  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 880.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words, or phrases hereinafter\nmentioned shall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation assigned to any\ndesignated waters or portions thereof for the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering or index system used to\nidentify specific waters of New York State was adapted from that used by the\n\nNew York State Conservation Department in its biological survey series of\nreports on the watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a drainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes, are usually referred to by name or abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered progressing upstream\nfrom the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively as they are\nencountered, such number being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such\nlakes or ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise\naround the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When isolated lakes and ponds\nare referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for convenience of their\nidentification and location within a subdrainage basin, and it is not\nnecessarily indicative of their being tributary to any waters to which no\nsurface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Mohawk-Hudson watershed in 1934 and has been closely followed in connection\nwith the identification of the waters with the following exceptions: some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the\ntime of its 1934 survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps, but appearing on the\nnewer maps, are designated by the letters a, b, c etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the West Creek drainage basin may be illustrated as\nfollows: Waters Index\n\nNumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\nH\nHudson River\n\nPrimary waters. H-240\n\nMohawk River\n\nThe 240th tributary of the Hudson River numbered\nconsecutively upstream from the mouth. H-240-180\n\nWest Canada Creek\n\nThe 180th tributary of the Mohawk River numbered\nconsecutively upstream from the mouth. H-240-180-P 799\n\nHinckley Reservoir\n\nThe 799th pond, lake or reservoir encountered in\nthe biological survey area of the Mohawk-Hudson watershed. H-240-180-P 799-19\n\nBlack Creek\n\nThe 19th tributary of Hinckley Reservoir numbered\nin a clockwise direction from the mouth. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary\nand subtributaries, shall mean any stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated\nwaters shall include only the stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface\nwater referenced by such waters index number; where tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the\nspecifically designated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond or body of\nsurface water referenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and\nsubtributaries, thereof, which are shown on the reference maps, excluding\nnumbered ponds, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\nknown and which name may appear on the reference maps. In cases of specifically\ndesignated waters which have no name, the named waters to which the unnamed\nwaters are tributary are identified as far as possible. (e) Description. The column headed \"Description\" contains designations or\nsections of waters under consideration to which a particular assignment of a\nclass and standards shall apply. Also included in this column is any useful\ninformation pertinent to the classification or standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as\nappearing in table I means map reference number and indicates one or more of\nthe following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on which\nthe specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown.

(h) Standards\nas appearing\nin table I, and denoted by the letters AA, A, B or C opposite each specifically\ndesignated waters, shall mean the quality standards established for class AA, A, B or C as the case may be, as set forth in Part 701, supra.
