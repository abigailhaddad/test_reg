  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1276.4 - Operation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Vehicle motors. Motors of tank vehicles shall not be run during cargo tank filling, making or\nbreaking filling connections, or during fuel handling system repairs. The\npropulsion motor for refueling service vehicles shall not be run during fuel\ntransfer, making or breaking of hose connections. (b) Maximum cargo volume. No cargo tank\ncompartment shall be completely filled. There shall be sufficient space\nremaining to allow for expansion of the contents to prevent distortion or\nleakage, and in no case shall the free space be less than two percent of the\ncapacity of the tank. Each tank compartment shall be fitted with a sealed gauge\nmarker set to indicate the maximum permissible capacity. (c) Attendants. The driver, operator or\nattendant of any tank vehicle shall be in attendance with the vehicle at all\ntimes when the vehicle is fueling or refueling an aircraft. Such person shall\nnot leave the tank vehicle to handle hose for overwing refueling or fuel from a\nwork stand in excess of six feet in height or in a position more than 50 feet\nfrom the tank vehicle unless a firewatch, familiar with the operation, is on\nhand on the ground. A firewatch shall not serve more than two vehicles or two\naircraft under fuel servicing simultaneously and must be within 75 feet of any\noperation under his surveillance. (d) Position. During refueling or defueling, tank vehicles shall be so placed as to be readily removable in event of fire so\nas to permit direct driving away from the loading or fueling position. Not more\nthan one refueler shall be positioned to refuel each wing of an aircraft; and\nnot more than two refuelers shall be positioned to serve the same aircraft. When high capacity aircraft are refueled additional refuelers shall not be\nparked or positioned within 100 feet from the aircraft served and then only in\nareas approved by the manager. (e) Smoking. Smoking by any person on or within 50 feet of a tank vehicle or\nrefueling service vehicle is prohibited. (f) Grounding. All tank vehicles shall be\nfitted with means of bonding and grounding. The maximum resistance of any\nstatic grounding or bonding circuit (bonding clips through the grounding cable, reels and chassis to the ground point) shall not exceed 100 ohms. During\nfilling of the cargo tank, the tank vehicle shall be grounded together with the\ntank truck filling rack and inflammable liquid discharge piping to a point of\nzero electrical potential. Prior to any transfer and during refueling or\ndefueling of aircraft, the fuel dispensing hose, nozzle, tank vehicle and the\naircraft shall be bonded and grounded to a point or points of zero electrical\npotential (the electrical potential of the earth in the vicinity of aircraft\nand fuel tank vehicle). Bonding of an underwing refueling nozzle to the\naircraft is not required when a metal to metal clamping contact between the\nnozzle and the filler connection is affected. Grounding shall be accomplished\nin the following manner: (1)\n\nAttaching the\nground conductor on the tank vehicle to a proper grounding rod. (2)\n\nAttaching the ground conductor to the\naircraft by use of either a Y connection or second grounding cable\ndevice. (3)\n\nBonding the aircraft\nand the dispensing nozzle or coupler connection by use of the clamp and bonding\nwire device attached to the nozzle prior to opening the aircraft tank and\ndisconnecting after the aircraft tank is filled and the filler opening is\nclosed. Under-the-wing nozzles only require bonding devices when of insulated\nconstruction preventing a firm metal to metal contact. (g) Fire extinguishers. Each tank vehicle\nshall be equipped with at least two 20 pound dry chemical extinguishers. The\nextinguishers shall be located in an accessible place as far away as\npracticable from the pumping equipment. Extinguishers shall be protected by\nreadily removable weatherproof hoods. (h) Parking. Tank vehicles shall not be\nparked in public areas except as designated by the airport operator. Tank\nvehicles wherever parked shall be positioned for immediate drive away or towing\nand a clear space of not less than 15 feet shall be maintained between any tank\nvehicle and any similar or other vehicle. No more than four refueler tank\nvehicles shall be parked unattended at any one location. Where five or more\nvehicles are parked, a constant attendant, qualified to drive the vehicles and\ncompetent in the operation of the fire protection equipment, shall be stationed\nin the area observing the operation and 150 pound dry chemical wheel type fire\nextinguishers shall be positioned so one or more units will be within 100 feet\ntravel distance from any parked vehicle in the designated area. Satellite\nparking areas shall be posted from all directions with a sign legible from a\n100 foot distance reading, \"Danger--Aircraft Fuel--No Smoking--No Open Fire or\n\nLights.\"\n(i) Markings. Each tank\nvehicle shall be conspicuously marked, on both sides and rear of the cargo tank\nin letters of contrasting color, at least six inches high, with the word\n\"FLAMMABLE.\"\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n1276.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
