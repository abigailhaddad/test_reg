  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 179-2.3 - General policies on the granting of good behavior allowances\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The opportunity\nto earn good behavior allowances offers the resident a tangible reward for\npositive efforts made during confinement. (b) For any resident serving an indeterminate\nsentence, other than a life sentence, who is not granted parole or a reparole, but who nevertheless has performed well within division secure facilities, good\nbehavior allowances can be used to obtain release under supervision and to\ndemonstrate, prior to completion of the term of the sentence, that the resident\ncan follow acceptable behavior patterns in the community as well as in a\ndivision facility. (c) In the case\nof a resident sentenced to a definite term of one year or less, good behavior\nallowances can be used to shorten the term of the sentence. (d) Good behavior allowances are a privilege\nto be earned by the resident. No resident has the right to demand that any good\nbehavior allowance be granted to him. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n179-2.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
