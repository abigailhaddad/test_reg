He or she shall not\nbe bound by the rules regarding the admissibility of evidence, but all\ntestimony shall be given under oath or affirmation. Either party may be\nrepresented by counsel, but no record of the proceeding before the arbitrator\nshall be kept. No expense shall be incurred by the arbitrator except upon the\nconsent in writing of the parties. (4)\n\nAfter the first hearing, neither party\nmay withdraw from the arbitration unless both parties consent to, or the\narbitrator directs, a discontinuance of the proceeding. (5)\n\nThe arbitrator shall make his or her\naward in writing and file the same forthwith, together with an opinion, if any, with the clerk of the small claims part. Unless both parties file a request in\nwriting not to enter judgment, the clerk shall, within two days after the\nfiling of the award, enter judgment in accordance therewith, provided the award\nhas been filed within 30 days from the date of filing the consent. The time\nwithin which the clerk shall enter judgment may be extended by a stipulation in\nwriting for a further period not to exceed 30 days.
