  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 622.4 - Lists of actions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Principles of compliance. (1)\n\nThe purpose of this section is to simplify the task of determining whether or\nnot a proposed action may have a significant effect on the environment by\nidentifying actions or classes of actions that are likely to have a significant\neffect and those which will not have a significant effect. Because of the\ncomplex and varied nature of OPWDD actions, the lists in this section are not\nall-inclusive. The omission from the lists of an action does not mean that it\nis exempt from this Part, nor does it mean that it is automatically an action\nrequiring preparation of an environmental impact statement. (2)\n\nThe criteria set forth in 6 NYCRR\n617.9\nshall be used to determine significance with respect to actions not listed in\nthis section. (i) Type I (see glossary). Actions or classes of actions that are likely to require preparation of\nenvironmental impact statements because they will in almost every instance have\na significant effect on the environment. (a) The OPWDD shall prepare, or cause to have prepared, program environmental\nimpact statements on proposed residential and/or day programs it undertakes or\ncarries out that may have a significant effect on the environment. (b) Such environmental impact statements\nshall be prepared on a priority basis and in a phased manner based on existing\nstaff and resources. (ii)\n\nType II (see glossary). Actions or\nclasses of actions which have been determined not to have a significant effect\non the environment through an environmental analysis (see glossary) and which\ndo not require environmental impact statements under this Part. Similarly, no\nindividual action shall be considered a Type II action if it would be located\nin an area where an otherwise insignificant impact could become significant as\ndetermined by the OPWDD. (iii)\n\nUnlisted. All actions not excluded or exempt as defined in paragraph (5) of\nthis subdivision, and not listed as a Type I or Type II action in this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nType I actions\nare those as defined in 6 NYCRR Part\n617. (4)\n\nThe following are Type II actions or\nclasses of actions: (i) The maintenance, repair, alteration, rehabilitation, or renovation of existing buildings. (a) This class includes both developmental\ncenter and community buildings, regardless of size, with the exception of\nbuildings listed on or eligible for listing on the State or National Register\nof historic places. (b) This class\ndoes not include those actions which would involve funding, approvals or\nundertakings by governmental bodies other than the OPWDD, except where such\ngovernmental bodies are performing ministerial actions (see\nglossary). (c) Both interior and\nexterior work are included in this class. The projects are of various size and\ncomplexity. The projects may range from minor to major maintenance and repair\nof community residential facilities and may include partial and/or complete\nreplacement of HVAC and electrical/lighting systems. (d) The completion of projects in this class\nwill not result in a change in the general function or purpose of buildings\nwhich will continue to relate, directly or supportively, to provision of\nservices to persons with developmental disabilities. (ii)\n\nThe acquisition, leasing, approval, alteration or renovation of an existing structure, building or facility for the\npurpose of the establishment of a community residential facility for persons\nwith developmental disabilities for no more than 14 such persons, is a Type II\naction when the following conditions exist: (a) The action is not part of a larger\nproject involving construction or acquisition of additional residences on\nadjacent properties. (b) The\nproject involves no more than 5 acres of land and the total area of the\nresidence does not exceed 6,000 square feet. (c) The site is not located in an area (see\nglossary) officially designated as environmentally, historically, or\narchaeologically sensitive; a certified agricultural district; or a 100-year\nflood plain. (5)\n\nThe following are considered actions that\nare either excluded or exempt from the SEQRA requirements of this Part. (i) enforcement of criminal proceedings or\nthe exercise of prosecutorial discretion in determining whether or not to\ninstitute such proceedings; (ii)\nministerial actions; (iii)\nmaintenance or repair involving no substantial changes in existing structure or\nfacility; (iv)\nwith respect to the\nrequirements of subdivision (2) of section 8-0109 of article 8 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law, actions requiring a certificate of\nenvironmental compatibility and public need under articles VII and VIII of the\n\nPublic Service Law and the consideration of, grant or denial of any such\ncertificate; (v) with respect to\nthe requirements of subdivision (2) of section 8-0109 of article 8 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law, actions subject to the jurisdiction of the\n\nAdirondack Park Agency pursuant to section\n809\nof the\n\nExecutive Law, including actions of the Adirondack Park Agency thereunder, and\nactions subject to the jurisdiction of local governments pursuant to section\n808\nof the\n\nExecutive Law, including actions of such local governments\nthereunder; (vi)\nactions which are\nimmediately necessary on an emergency basis for the protection or preservation\nof life, health, property or natural resources; or\n(vii)\nactions of the Legislature of the State\nof New York or of any court.
