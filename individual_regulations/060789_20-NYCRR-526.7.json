  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 526.7 - Sale, selling or purchase\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1101(b)(5)\n(a) Definition. (1)\n\nThe words\nsale, selling\nor\npurchase\nmean any transaction in which there is a transfer\nof title or possession, or both, of tangible personal property for a\nconsideration. (2)\n\nAmong the\ntransactions included in the words\nsale, selling\nor\npurchase\nare exchanges, barters, rentals, leases or licenses\nto use or consume tangible personal property. (3)\n\nThe term\nsale\nalso\nincludes the transfer of tangible personal property in a repossession or\nforeclosure action. Such transfer may be effected in any manner, including, but\nnot limited to voluntary relinquishment, assignment or seizure by the\nmortgagee. The transfer of tangible personal property in a repossession or\nforeclosure action by the mortgagees for the purpose of resale is not a taxable\ntransaction. (See bulk transfer provisions, Part 537 of this\n\nSubchapter.)\n(4)\n\nThe term\nsale\nalso includes the rendering of a service enumerated in\nsubdivisions (b) and (c) of this section, and the transactions enumerated in\nsubdivision (d), (e) or (f) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law, except services taxed\nunder section\n1105 (c)\nof the Tax Law\nwhen performed by an employee. (5)\n\nThe term\nsale\ndoes not apply to the transfer of tangible\npersonal property to a carrier, repairman, warehouseman or insurer by the owner\nof the property after payment for damages thereto or loss thereof. Example 1: A carrier, while transporting tangible personal property\nfor a customer, damages the property. The carrier then makes a cash payment to\nthe customer for the amount the customer paid for the property, and retains the\ndamaged property. The retention of the property by the carrier is not a\nsale. Example 2: A motor vehicle is damaged in an accident, and the insurer\nconsiders it a total loss. The insurer pays the owner cash, and takes the\nvehicle. The taking of the vehicle by the insurer is not a sale. The purchase\nof another vehicle by the owner of the damaged vehicle, with the proceeds of\nthe insurance, is a retail sale. (b) Consideration. The term\nconsideration\nincludes monetary\nconsideration, exchange, barter, the rendering of any service, or any agreement\ntherefor. Monetary consideration\nincludes assumption of\nliabilities, fees, rentals, royalties or any other charge that a purchaser, lessee or licensee is required to pay. (c) Rentals, leases, licenses to\nuse. (1)\n\nThe terms\nrental, lease and license to use\nrefer to all transactions in which there is a\ntransfer for a consideration of possession of tangible personal property\nwithout a transfer of title to the property. Whether a transaction is a \"sale\"\nor a \"rental, lease or license to use\" shall be determined in accordance with\nthe provisions of the agreement. (See section\n527.15\nof this Title for special rules pertaining to certain leases of motor vehicles, vessels and noncommercial aircraft.)\n(2)\n\nWhere a lease (other than one described\nin section\n527.15\nof this Title) with an option to purchase has been entered into, and the option\nis exercised, the tax will be payable on the consideration given when the\noption is exercised, in addition to the taxes paid or payable on each lease\npayment. (3)\nA lease which has been\nentered into merely as a security agreement, but which does not in fact\nrepresent a transaction in which there has been a transfer of possession from\nthe lessor to the lessee, is not a \"sale\" within the meaning of the Tax Law. Cross-reference: See section\n527.15\nof this Title for special rules pertaining to certain leases of motor vehicles, vessels and noncommercial aircraft. (d) Barters or exchanges. The transfer of tangible personal property or services to a\nperson in consideration for tangible personal property or services received is\na \"sale\" under the Tax Law. Cross-reference: For trade-ins, see section\n526.5\n(f) of this Part. Example 1: A and B exchange automobiles. The exchange is a sale under\nthe Tax Law, and each party is liable for the payment of the tax measured by\nthe current market value of the automobile received. Example 2: A carpenter agrees to repair real property for an\nautomobile mechanic who in turn will repair the carpenter's truck. The exchange\nof services is a sale. Each party is required to collect the tax from the\nother, based upon his normal charge for such service. Example 3: A dentist performs a nontaxable service for a photographer\nwho in turn takes a family portrait for the dentist. The dentist is required to\npay the tax on the photograph, based upon the amount he would have charged the\nphotographer for his service. (e) Transfer of possession. (1)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in paragraph\n(3) of this subdivision, a sale is taxable at the place where the tangible\npersonal property or service is delivered, or the point at which possession is\ntransferred by the vendor to the purchaser or his designee. Example 1: A person purchases tangible personal property in New York\n\nState, and takes delivery at the time of the purchase. As delivery occurred in\n\nNew York State, the receipt from the sale is taxable. Example 2: A person, not a resident of New York State, purchases\ntangible personal property in New York State and has it delivered to his home\nout of state. The receipt from the sale is not taxable in New York State as\ndelivery was made outside of New York State. Example 3: A New York State vendor ships tangible personal property, not for resale, to its customer in New York State, F.O.B. Chicago, Illinois. Delivery occurs in New York State. The receipt from the sale is taxable. Example 4: A common carrier purchases tangible personal property in\n\nNew York State, takes delivery of it in New York State and transports it out of\nstate for use at its out-of-state location. The receipt from the sale is\ntaxable in New York State, as delivery occurred in the State, but the carrier\nmay be eligible for a refund or credit under section\n1119 (a)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. Example 5: A New Jersey resident purchases woolens from a New York\n\nState supplier and requests that the woolens be shipped to a New York State\ndressmaker to produce wearing apparel not intended for resale. The dressmaker\nwill ship the completed apparel to New Jersey. Since the delivery of the\nwoolens occurred in New York State, the woolens are subject to tax. However, the charge for producing the wearing apparel is not subject to tax because\ndelivery of the wearing apparel takes place in New Jersey. (2)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in paragraph\n(3) of this subdivision, a sale of tangible personal property, in which the\ntitle to the property passes in New York State, but in which delivery occurs\noutside of New York State, is not subject to tax. Example 6: Corporation A and Corporation B have their headquarters in\n\nNew York State, and agree that Corporation A will purchase all of the assets of\nan out-of-state division of Corporation B. Title to the assets passes in New\n\nYork State. Corporation A starts to operate the division, and does not move any\nof the tangible personal property. As delivery of the property occurred out of\nstate, the sale is not subject to tax. (3)\n\nWhere florists conduct transactions\nthrough a florist's telegraphic or telephonic delivery association, the\nfollowing rules apply in the determination of tax liability on sales through\nsuch an association: (i) A New York State\nflorist who receives an order pursuant to which he gives telegraphic or\ntelephonic instructions to a second florist for delivery of flowers is liable\nfor collection of the tax at the rate in effect in the jurisdiction where the\norder is taken. It is immaterial whether the second florist is located in or\noutside of New York State, or whether delivery occurs in or outside of New York\n\nState. All service, telephone calls, relays and any other charges for the\norders shall be considered to be a part of the selling price. (ii)\n\nIn cases where New York State florists\nreceive telegraphic or telephonic instructions from other florists either\ninside or outside of New York State for delivery of flowers, the receiving\nflorist is not required to collect tax with respect to any receipts which he\nmay realize from the transaction. Example 7: A customer places an order for flowers with a florist\nlocated within New York State in an area in which the combined rate of State\nand local sales tax is seven percent. The flowers are to be delivered in\n\nFlorida. Arrangements are made through a telegraphic delivery association by\nthe New York State florist to have a florist in Florida make up the floral\narrangement and deliver it. The New York florist is required to collect sales\ntax at the rate of seven percent on the total receipts paid by the\ncustomer. Example 8: A customer places an order for flowers with a florist\nlocated within an area of New York State in which the rate of sales tax is four\npercent. The flowers are to be delivered within an area of New York State in\nwhich the combined rate of State and local sales tax is seven percent. Arrangements are made by the florist through a telegraphic delivery association\nto have another florist fill the order and deliver the flowers. The florist who\nreceived the order from the customer is required to collect sales tax at the\nrate of four percent on the total receipts paid by the\ncustomer. (iii)\n\nSales made\nby florists which are not made through a florist's telegraphic or telephonic\ndelivery association are subject to the rules contained in paragraphs (1) and\n(2) of this subdivision. Example 9: A New York State florist receives an order from a customer\nfor flowers which are to be delivered to another jurisdiction within this\n\nState. The florist delivers the flowers himself. He is required to collect the\ntax based upon the combined rate of State and local sales tax in effect in the\njurisdiction in which the flowers are delivered. Example 10: A New York State florist receives an order from a customer\nfor flowers which are to be delivered outside of New York State. The florist\ndelivers the flowers himself. The receipts from the sale are not taxable as\ndelivery occurs outside of New York State. (4)\n\nTransfer of possession\nwith respect to a rental, lease or license to use, means that one of the\nfollowing attributes of property ownership has been transferred: (i) custody or possession of the tangible\npersonal property, actual or constructive; (ii)\nthe right to custody or possession of\nthe tangible personal property; (iii)\nthe right to use, or control or direct\nthe use of, tangible personal property. Example 11: A company enters into an agreement with another company to\nlease a copying machine for two years, at a flat rental fee, payable in 24\ninstallments, plus a fee per copy made. This transaction is taxable, as a sale, and the tax is applicable to the receipts from the flat rental fee and the\nper-copy fee. (5)\n\nIt is not essential for a transfer of possession to include the right to move\nthe tangible personal property which is the subject of a rental, lease or\nlicense to use. Example 12: A corporation contracts with a computer center to use the\ncomputer on the center's premises for 10 hours weekly. The corporation provides\nits own operation and its own materials. During the 10-hour period, no one else\nmay use the machine. This transaction, commonly known as the sale of raw time, constitutes a transfer of possession, pursuant to a rental, lease or license to\nuse, which is a sale subject to tax. Example 13: A corporation contracts with a computer center to use the\ncomputer on the center's premises for 10 hours weekly. The corporation provides\nits own materials and the computer center provides and directs the operator. During the 10-hour period, no one else may use the machine. In this case, there\nis no transfer of possession to the corporation as it has no control over the\noperation of the computer. However, the transaction may be taxable based on the\ninformation provided to the customer. Example 14: A corporation contracts with a computer center for access\ntime on the computer center's equipment through the use of a terminal located\nin the corporation's office. The terminal is connected to the computer by\ntelephone. The corporation's access to the computer through the terminal is not\ndeemed to be a transfer of possession of the computer subject to tax. However, the transaction may be taxable based on the information provided to the\ncustomer. Cross-reference: See section\n527.3\nof this Subchapter for taxable status of information services. (6)\n\nWhen a lease of equipment includes the\nservices of an operator, possession is deemed to be transferred where the\nlessee has the right to direct and control the use of the equipment. The\noperator's wages, when separately stated, are excludible from the receipt of\nthe lease, provided they reflect prevailing wage rates. Example 15: A company enters into an agreement to lease a crane, together with the services of the operator of the crane. The operator will take\ninstructions from the company's foreman, and the company determines the working\nhours and locations. The operator's wages are separately stated. This\ntransaction is within the definition of sale, and the transfer of possession\nhas occurred by reason of the company's right to direct and control the use of\nthe equipment by the operator. The taxable receipt excludes the operator's\nwages. (f) Reproduction rights. (1)\n\nThe granting\nof a right to reproduce an original painting, illustration, photograph, sculpture, manuscript or other similar work is not a license to use or a sale, and is not taxable, where the payment made for such right is in the nature of a\nroyalty to the grantor under the laws relating to artistic and literary\nproperty. (2)\n\nMere temporary\npossession or custody for the purpose of making the reproduction is not deemed\nto be a transfer of possession which would convert the reproduction right into\na license to use. (See\n\nHowitt\nv. Street and Smith\n\nPublications, Inc., 276 N.Y. 345 and\n\nMatter of\n\nFrissell\nv. McGoldrick, 300 N.Y. 370.)\n(3)\n\nWhere some use other than reproduction is\nmade of the original work, such as retouching or exhibiting a photograph, the\ntransaction is a license to use, which is taxable. Example 1: A person contracts with an artist for a right to reproduce\none of the artist's paintings on a book cover. No other right is given by the\nartist for the use of his painting. The person who obtains the reproduction\nright to the painting may have copies made and returns the painting to the\nartist without alteration, change or correction, and without having destroyed\nor publicly exhibited the painting. The transfer is not held to be a\ntransaction subject to the sales tax, as a rental, lease or license to\nuse. Example 2: A photographer takes photographs and furnishes the same to\na magazine publisher for the purpose of reproduction. In the course of\nreproduction, the photograph is retouched by the publisher. After reproduction, the photograph is returned to the photographer. The receipts from such\ntransaction are subject to the tax as a license to use. Example 3: A dealer collects photographs and photographic prints. He\nfurnishes the prints to a magazine publisher for the purpose of further\nreproduction. After reproduction, the prints are returned to the dealer. The\nprints may or may not be changed or altered. The receipts from such\ntransactions are subject to the tax. Since the dealer merely collects the\nphotographic prints and does not have the right to grant the right to reproduce\nthe original, the transaction is deemed to be a license to use tangible\npersonal property.
