(b) Upon written application\nby a facility owner or operator, the department may allow for a process\nemission source or emission point an equivalent opacity standard exceeding the\nopacity standard of Subdivision (a) of this Section, if the facility owner or\noperator can demonstrate through acceptable tests for such source that the\nfacility is in compliance with all applicable emission limits and requirements\nother than the opacity standard and that the process emission source and any\nassociated emission control equipment is being operated and maintained in a\nmanner acceptable to the department. An equivalent opacity standard for a\nprocess emission source will only be allowed where Reasonably Available Control\n\nTechnology (RACT), as determined by the department, has been utilized for air\ncontaminants contributing to opacity. In such cases, the facility owner or\noperator shall not cause or allow emissions to exceed the equivalent opacity\nstandard. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
