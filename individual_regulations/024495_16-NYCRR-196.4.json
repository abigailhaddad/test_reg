  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 196.4 - Subdivisions of accounts\n\nState Regulations\n\nSubdivisions of any account in this system of accounts\nmay be kept, and upon order of the commission shall be kept. The title of each\nsuch subdivision shall clearly indicate the account of which it is a part. When\nan account is subdivided in the general ledger, an account need not also be\nraised for the total of the subdivisions. When such subdivisions are carried in\nsubsidiary ledgers, however, the general ledger shall contain the controlling\naccounts therefor so that a complete general ledger trial balance may be\nobtained. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n196.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
