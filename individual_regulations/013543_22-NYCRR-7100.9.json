Tit. 22 § 7100.9 - Report to the Governor\n\nState Regulations\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the meeting of\nthe commission at which the nomination procedure has been concluded, the\nchairperson and counsel will prepare, in consultation with the commission, and\nthe chairperson will sign, a single written report to the Governor or\n\nGovernor-elect, as the case may be, which will contain the commission's\nnominations, in conformance with section\n63\n(3)\nof the Judiciary Law. The report will set\nforth: (a) the relevant\naccomplishments of each nominee, and include major legal matters in which the\nnominee participated, as well as other notable professional qualities that the\ncommission considered important in determining that each was well qualified and\nfit to serve as the Chief or an Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals, as the\ncase may be; and\n(b) the efforts made by the commission and counsel to publicize each vacancy and to\nsolicit applications from the broadest group of well qualified candidates. However, the report will not compromise the confidentiality of commission\nproceedings, as mandated by section\n66\nof the\n\nJudiciary Law. In order to enhance participation in the selection process, the\nreport will also encourage the public to submit comments concerning the\nnominees to the Governor prior to the Governor's appointment of a nominee, in\naccordance with section\n68\nof the\n\nJudiciary Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\n§\n7100.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
