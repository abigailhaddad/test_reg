  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 380-11.5 - Table III Releases to Sewer\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe monthly average concentration limits for release to\nsanitary sewers are applicable to the provisions in section\n380-4.2\nof this Part. The\nconcentration values were derived by taking the most restrictive occupational\nstochastic oral ingestion ALI and dividing by 7.3 x\n10\n6\n(ml). The factor of 7.3 x\n10\n6\n(ml) is composed of a factor of 7.3 x\n10\n5\n(ml), the annual water intake by reference man, and a factor of 10, such that the concentrations, if the sewage released by the\nlicensee were the only source of water ingested by a reference man during a\nyear, would result in a committed effective dose equivalent of 0.5\nrem. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n380-11.5\n\nAmended\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register April 25, 2018/Volume XL, Issue 17, eff. 5/10/2018\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
