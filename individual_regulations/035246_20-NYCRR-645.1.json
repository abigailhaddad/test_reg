  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 645.1 - Supplemental mortgages\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 255\n(a) A supplemental mortgage is an additional instrument or mortgage which is\nrecorded subsequent to the recording and prior to the discharge or satisfaction\nof a prior primary mortgage on which all taxes, if any, accrued under article\n11 of the Tax Law have been paid, the terms of which make reference to the\nprior recorded primary mortgage, and which is given and recorded: (1)\nfor the purpose of correcting or\nperfecting such prior recorded primary mortgage; (2)\npursuant to some provision or covenant in\nsuch prior recorded primary mortgage; (3)\nfor the purpose of providing additional\nor further security for the payment of the principal debt or obligation secured\nby the prior recorded primary mortgage by spreading the lien of the prior\nrecorded primary mortgage to additional real property or by imposing a new lien\non such additional real property (see section\n645.2\n[c], [d], [e] or [f]\nof this Part); or\n(4)\nfor the purpose of coordinating or\nconsolidating the liens of prior recorded primary mortgages to form a single\nand coordinate equal lien; or\n(5)\nfor the purpose of modifying a prior recorded primary mortgage, for reasons\nincluding but not limited to the following: (i) adjusting the term for the payment of the\ndebt secured by the prior recorded primary mortgage; (ii)\nchanging the interest rate on the debt\nsecured by the prior recorded primary mortgage; (iii)\nsubstituting a new mortgagor for the\nmortgagor; (iv)\nsubstituting a new\nmortgagee for the mortgagee due to an assignment of the mortgage; (v) evidencing a change in the amount of debt\nor obligation which is secured or which under any contingency may be secured by\nthe prior recorded primary mortgage; or\n(6)\nfor the purpose of severing the lien(s)\nof a prior recorded primary mortgage or mortgages into separate\nliens. (b) Examples of supplemental mortgages. Example 1: The proper mortgage recording taxes were paid upon the\nrecording of a mortgage containing an error in the description of the real\nproperty covered by the mortgage. An instrument recorded for the purpose of\ncorrecting the description constitutes a supplemental mortgage. Example 2: The proper mortgage recording taxes were paid upon the\nrecording of an agreement to give a mortgage, and later the mortgage is given\nand recorded. The subsequent mortgage is a supplemental mortgage. Example 3: The proper mortgage recording taxes were paid upon the\nrecording of a taxable executory contract, which provides for the subsequent\ngiving of a purchase money mortgage to the contract vendor. The mortgage given\nin accordance with the terms of the contract constitutes a supplemental\nmortgage. Example 4: The proper mortgage recording taxes were paid upon the\nrecording of a building and loan mortgage. The building and loan mortgage\nprovided that the mortgage, upon completion of the construction project, shall\nbe divided into two separate mortgages to be executed between the parties to\nthe original building and loan mortgage. The building and loan mortgage also\nprovides that it will be satisfied when the two separate mortgages are given. The latter two separate mortgages would constitute supplemental\nmortgages. Example 5: The proper mortgage recording taxes were paid upon the\nrecording of a mortgage covering parcel A. An instrument is later recorded for\nthe purpose of spreading the lien of the mortgage to include parcel B. Such\ninstrument would constitute a supplemental mortgage. Example 6: In 1985, a mortgage is given to Bank X by Mr. Smith. The\nnote secured by the mortgage provides for an adjustable rate of interest. In\n1991 the terms of the note are amended to provide a fixed rate of interest and\nthe mortgage is modified accordingly. Such agreement is a supplemental\nmortgage. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
