  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 421.16 - Adoption study criteria\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An adoption study shall explore the\nfollowing characteristics of applicants: (1)\ncapacity to give and receive affection; (2)\nability to provide for a child's physical\nand emotional needs; (3)\nability to\naccept the intrinsic worth of a child, to respect and share his past, to\nunderstand the meaning of separation he has experienced, and to have realistic\nexpectations and goals; (4)\nflexibility and ability to change; (5)\nability to cope with problems, stress and\nfrustration; (6)\nfeelings about\nparenting an adopted child and the ability to make a commitment to a child\nplaced in the home; and\n(7)\nability\nto use community resources to strengthen and enrich family\nfunctioning. (b) Age. Applicants accepted for adoption study shall be at least\n18 years old. The agency shall not establish any other minimum or maximum age\nfor study or acceptance. (c) Health. (1)\n\nAn approved applicant shall be in such\nphysical condition that it is reasonable to expect him/her to live to the\nchild's majority and to have the energy and other abilities needed to fulfill\nthe parental responsibilities. (2)\nA report of a physical examination conducted not more than one year preceding\nthe date of the adoption application by a physician, physician assistant, nurse\npractitioner or other licensed and qualified health care practitioner, as\nappropriate, regarding the members of the household's general health, that\nindicates the absence of communicable disease, infection, or illness or any\nphysical or mental condition(s) which might affect the proper care of an\nadopted child, or that presence of any identified affliction does not pose a\nrisk to the health and safety of an adopted child, must be filed with the\nagency. If the adoptive applicant is or has been a foster parent, and the\nagency which certified, licensed or approved the foster parent has a completed\nmedical report on the foster family in its records, the foster family medical\nreport will satisfy this requirement, if the medical report was completed\nwithin the past year. (3)\n\nUpon a\nfinding of physical condition(s) which are likely to have negative effects upon\nan applicant's ability to carry out the parental role, an adoption study may be\ndiscontinued with the agreement of the applicant. If the applicant does not\nagree about the likelihood of such negative effects, he shall be given the\nopportunity to seek another medical opinion, and file another medical report, before a final decision is made. (4)\n\nThe record of a study discontinued or\nresulting in rejection because of present or expected effects of a medical\ncondition, must identify the condition found and effects found or\nexpected. (d) Marital\nstatus. Agencies must not consider marital status in their\nacceptance or rejection of applicants. However, one married partner may not\nadopt without the other unless one partner is living separate and apart from\nhis or her spouse pursuant to a legally recognizable separation agreement or\ndecree of separation, or one partner has been or will be living separate and\napart from his or her spouse for a period of three years or more prior to the\ncommencement of the adoption proceeding. Agencies must not establish policies\nwhich place single or divorced applicants, applicants who are separated from\ntheir spouses pursuant to a legally recognizable separation agreement or decree\nof separation, applicants who have been or will be living separate and apart\nfrom their spouses for a period of three of more years, or widowed applicants, at a disadvantage. (e) Fertility. An adoptive applicant may not be rejected for adoption\nbecause of his, her or their fertility (capacity to have biological children). The significance of fertility and/or infertility as it relates to the desire to\nadopt shall always be explored in the adoption process, but applicants shall\nnot be required to provide proof of infertility. (f) Family composition. (1)\n\nThe agency may study family size as it\nrelates to the ability of a family to care for another child and the quality of\nlife which will be offered to an adoptive child. Policies shall not be\nestablished which require rejection of an applicant based on family composition\nwithout determining its effect on the ability to care for a child and the\nquality of life which will be offered. (2)\n\nPresence or absence of children in\napplicant's home regardless of their age and sex shall not be a basis for\nrejecting applicants. (3)\n\nAdoptive\nplacement which will result in there being more than two infants under the age\nof two in the home at the same time shall be made only after a study\nspecifically focusing on the family's ability to care successfully for such a\nnumber of infants. (4)\n\nIf any\nchildren in an approved home are there as foster children, placement of an\nadoptive child shall be delayed if it would result in a family composition\nwhich violates section 378.4 of the Social Services Law. (5)\n\nAn adoptive placement shall not be made\nwhere a child previously placed for adoption has not yet been adopted, except: (i) where the child to be placed is a sibling\nof one already in the home; (ii)\nwhere the delay in adoption is due primarily to court delays; or\n(iii)\nwhere the child to be placed is\nunusually hard to place and other placement resources are not\navailable. (6)\n\nAny\nexceptions pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subdivision shall be fully\ndocumented in the records. (g) Sex preference and matching. (1)\n\nSingle applicants shall not be rejected\nbecause they seek children of only the same sex (or only the opposite\nsex). (2)\n\nExploration of a\npreference to adopt a child of a particular gender, where found necessary and\nappropriate, shall be carried out openly with a clear explanation to the\napplicant of the basis for, and relevance of, the inquiry. (h) Employment and education of parents. Employment, education, or volunteer activities of\napplicants may not be a basis for rejection. (i) Religion and race. Race, ethnic group, and religion shall not be a basis for\nrejecting an adoption applicant. (j) Income. No applicant shall be rejected on the basis of low\nincome, or because of receipt of income maintenance payments. The adoption\nstudy process shall evaluate an applicant's ability to budget his resources in\nsuch a way that a child placed with him can be reasonably assured of minimum\nstandards of nutrition, health, shelter, clothing and other essentials. An\napplicant whose budgeting and money management skills appear deficient to\nassure such minimum standards shall be referred to any available resources\nwhich might help improve these skills. (k) Employment and geographical stability. Changes in employment and residences may be examined to\ndetermine the significance of such changes for the functioning and well-being\nof the family and any child to be placed in the home. Frequent changes in\nemployment and residences shall not be a basis for rejection unless it is\ndetermined that such changes reflect an inability to provide for the well-being\nof any child to be placed in the home. (l) Child care experience. An adoption study shall inquire into an applicant's\nexperience with children and offer him and/or her, if feasible, the opportunity\nto increase his/her experience, knowledge and skills in this area. However, no\napplicant should be rejected solely on the basis of a lack of such\nexperience. (m) Socialization and community support. The adoption study process shall include inquiry into the\napplicant's ability to locate and take advantage of human and organizational\nresources to strengthen their own capacity as parents. There shall not be any\nrequirement for particular levels of educational achievement or kinds of\norganizational involvement or community recognition. (n) Inquiry of State Central Register of\n\nChild Abuse and Maltreatment. An adoption study must include an inquiry of the\ndepartment regarding whether the applicant is the subject of an indicated child\nabuse and maltreatment report on file with the State Central Register of Child\n\nAbuse and Maltreatment.

(2)\n\nIf the\napplication is approved, the agency must indicate in writing in the adoption\nstudy record the specific reason(s) why the person who is the subject of an\nindicated report was determined to be appropriate to receive an adoption\nplacement. (3)\n\nIf the agency\nrejects the applicant, giving the indicated report as a reason, the applicant\nmust be informed in writing of the reasons for such decision and that: (i) he/she has a right to a hearing under\nsection\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law, regarding the record maintained in the State Central\n\nRegister of Child Abuse and Maltreatment; (ii)\na request for such a hearing must be\nmade within 90 days of the receipt of the written notice of rejection which\nindicates that the rejection is based in whole or in part on the existence of\nthe indicated report; and\n(iii)\nthe\nsole issue at any such hearing will be whether the applicant has been shown by\na fair preponderance of the evidence to have committed the act or acts of child\nabuse or maltreatment giving rise to the indicated report. (4)\n\nIf in a hearing under section\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law the department fails to show by a preponderance of the\nevidence that the applicant committed the act or acts upon which the indicated\nreport is based, the department will notify the agency which made the inquiry\nthat, pursuant to the hearing decision, any decision to deny the applicant\nbased on the indicated report should be reconsidered, upon receiving such\nnotification from the department, the agency should reopen the adoption study\nand review its decision without considering the indicated report. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of\nthis Part, the requirements of this section relating to an inquiry to the\n\nStatewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment apply to a person\napplying to be an approved adoptive parent to an authorized agency as defined\nby section\n371 (10)(a) (b) or\n(c) of the Social Services Law or an agency\napproved by the Office of Children and Family Services to place out children\nfor the purpose of adoption in accordance with article 13 of the Not-for-Profit\n\nCorporation Law.
