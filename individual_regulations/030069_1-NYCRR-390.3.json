County agricultural and farmland\nprotection boards may develop agricultural and farmland protection plans, in\ncooperation and consultation with the county's soil and water conservation\ndistrict and the U.S.D.A., Natural Resources Conservation Service. The boards\nmay cooperate and consult with other interested parties, such as\nmunicipalities, cooperative extension services, planning organizations, private\nland trusts, farm organizations, and civic and citizen organizations, in\ndeveloping plans. The plans shall include at least the following elements: (1)\na statement of the county's goal(s) with\nrespect to agricultural and farmland protection (e.g., to stabilize or enhance\nthe agricultural economy of the county; preserve open space; abate land\nconversion pressure; maintain community goals with respect to development and\ngrowth; and protect natural resources such as air quality, watersheds, aquifers\nor wildlife habitats); (2)\nan\nidentification of the general location of any lands or areas that are proposed\nto be protected (e.g., the whole county, all agricultural district lands within\nthe county, farms or farmlands in particular sections of the county). Specific\ntracts of land or farms need not be identified. Maps are not mandatory but may\nbe used at the discretion of the board to illustrate strategies or to explain\nthe plan more completely; (3)\nan\nanalysis of the lands or areas to be protected, such as their value to the\nagricultural economy of the county, their open space value, the level of\nconversion pressure being experienced, and the consequences of possible\nconversion; (4)\na description of\nthe strategies intended to be used by the county to promote the maintenance of\nlands in active agricultural use and to implement the plan, including how the\nprogram will be financed; and\n(5)\na\ndescription or identification of other county and municipal planning and land\nuse programs, if any, such as economic development, zoning and comprehensive\nland use planning, which may be shown to complement and be consistent with, the\ncounty agricultural protection plan, as well as identification of any county\nand municipal plans, policies or objectives which are inconsistent with or\nconflict with the plan. (b) Planning and approval process. In\ndeveloping an agricultural and farmland protection plan, the board and the\ncounty legislative body shall follow the planning and approval process in\nsequence as follows: (1)\nthe county\nagricultural and farmland protection board shall conduct at least one public\nhearing to solicit citizen views and recommendations; (2)\nthe board shall undertake specific\nefforts to involve members of the farm community in the planning process, and\nto assure that the final plan is made available to the farm community for\ncomment before it is approved; (3)\nthe county agricultural and farmland protection board shall consult with the\ndepartment throughout the planning process; (4)\nthe county agricultural and farmland\nprotection board shall submit the proposed plan to the county legislative body\nfor approval; (5)\nif the county\nlegislative body approves the plan, its approval should be documented by a\nresolution; (6)\nplans of work must\nbe completed within 18 months to be eligible for State matching grants under\nthis program, unless said period is extended by written agreement between the\ncounty and the department; however, the county legislative body need not\napprove the final plan within 18 months; and\n(7)\nthe county legislative body shall submit\nthe plan to the commissioner for approval. The commissioner shall act upon the\nplan within 45 days of receipt of the document, and notify the county\nlegislative body of the plan's approval or disapproval. A copy of the\ncommissioner's decision shall be sent to the chair of the county agricultural\nand farmland protection board. (c) Plan review process. The following\ncriteria shall be used by the commissioner to determine the acceptability of a\ncounty agricultural and farmland protection plan: (1)\nthe consistency of the plan with State\nagricultural and farmland protection plans, policies and objectives; State\nenvironmental plans, policies, and objectives; and State comprehensive plans, policies, and objectives; (2)\nthe\nconsistency of the plan with county and municipal plans, policies, and\nobjectives which the plan could affect; (3)\nthe practicality of the plan (i.e., the\nextent to which it can reasonably be expected to meet the identified county\ngoal(s) for agricultural and farmland protection); (4)\nthe extent to which the plan satisfies\nthe analytical factors addressed under section\n324\nof the Agriculture and Markets Law; (5)\nthe adequacy of substantiating data, information, and facts; (6)\nthe\ncost implications of the protection measures identified in the plan (i.e., what\ncan be accomplished recognizing limited State/local funding mechanisms in view\nof the public benefit to be derived from protection of agriculture and\nagricultural lands); and\n(7)\nwhether the county legislative body has approved the plan.
