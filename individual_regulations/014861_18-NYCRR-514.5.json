  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 514.5 - Card swipe\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The MA recipient identification card is a plastic card which can withstand\nrepeated use. This card, with or without a photograph of the recipient, is the\ncard most commonly used by the MA program throughout the State. (b) The plastic identification card has a\nmagnetic strip on the reverse side containing encoded information which is read\nby the MET. (c) If the department\nrequires a provider to use a MET, the provider is also required to insert the\nrecipient's plastic card into the MET and \"swipe\" the card through the terminal\nin order that the MET may read the encoded information. (d) If the card swipe capability is not\nfunctioning or if the recipient does not have a plastic identification card\n(e.g., the recipient has a temporary MA identification card or replacement\ncard), the provider must manually enter the recipient information into the MET\nor use the alternative telephone verification procedure provided for in\nconjunction with EMEVS to verify eligibility. (e) If a provider who is required to use a\nMET does not use the card swipe capability of the MET in a significant number\nof its weekly MA transactions, the department may withhold payment of claims\nequivalent in dollar value to the percentage of claims in such weekly\ntransaction period with respect to which the provider failed to use the card\nswipe capability pending an audit or review of the claims submitted and the\nprovider's service and claiming practices. If the department finds a\nsignificant number of unjustified failures by the provider to use the card\nswipe capability, the department may treat such provider failures as an\nunacceptable practice under Part 515 of this Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n514.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
