(b) At any scheduled call of a calendar\nor at a pretrial conference, if all parties do not appear and proceed or\nannounce their readiness to proceed immediately or subject to the engagement of\ncounsel, the judge presiding may note the default on the record and enter an\norder as follows: (1)\n\nIf the\nplaintiff appears but the defendant does not, the judge may grant judgment by\ndefault or order an inquest. (2)\n\nIf the defendant appears but the\nplaintiff does not, the judge may dismiss the action and may order a severance\nof counterclaims or cross-claims. (3)\n\nIf no party appears, the judge may\nstrike the action from the calendar or make such other order as appears\njust. (c) Actions stricken from the calendar may be restored to the calendar only upon\nstipulation of all parties so ordered by the court or by motion on notice to\nall other parties, made within one year after the action is stricken. A motion\nmust be supported by affidavit by a person having firsthand knowledge, satisfactorily explaining the reasons for the action having been stricken and\nshowing that it is presently ready for trial. (d) If an order of restoration is\ngranted, it shall provide that a new notice of trial be filed forthwith and\nthat the case be placed on the general trial calendar in its regular place as\nof the date of filing the new notice of trial, unless the court in its\ndiscretion orders otherwise. A copy of the order shall be served on the\ncalendar clerk, and the case shall receive a new calendar number followed by\nthe letter \"R\" to designate the case as having been restored. If a restored\ncase is not ready when reached, it shall forthwith be dismissed or an inquest\nor judgment ordered as provided in subdivision (b) of this section. (e) Applications to restore an\naction to the ready calendar in the event of a reversal or a direction of a new\ntrial by an appellate court shall be made returnable in the appropriate motion\npart, except that if all parties do not appear by attorney, the clerk shall, without formal application, restore the action to the ready calendar. (f) When an action has been\ntried and the jury has disagreed, or a verdict set aside, or there has been a\nmistrial for any reason, or if no decision has been made or judgment rendered\nwithin the time specified in section 1304 of the UDCA, or if the court has\nordered a new trial under CPLR 4402, such action must be restored to the\nappropriate ready calendar for a day certain to be fixed by the\ncourt.
