  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 861.10 - Effective disinfection\n\nState Regulations\n\nEffective disinfection is defined as the destruction of\npathogenic organisms. Since isolation of pathogenic organisms in water is not\nroutine, the test for the fecal coliform group of organisms will be used as an\nindicator. (a) Coliform requirement. Effective disinfection means the treatment of wastes such that the number of\norganisms of the fecal coliform group remaining after treatment does not\nexceed: (1)\n200 per 100 milliliters as a\ngeometric average; (2)\n1,000 per\n100 milliliters in more than 10 percent of the samples taken over a period of\n30 consecutive days. (b) Chlorination. (1)\n\nChlorination facilities\nshall be designed to obtain a minimum contact time of 15 minutes at peak hourly\nflow. (2)\n\nAfter the required\ncontact time, maintenance of a free chlorine residual of 1.0 milligram per\nliter at all times, as determined by the orthotolidine-arsenite (OTA) test, will be considered satisfactory if the effluent is found to meet the coliform\nrequirements of this section. (c) Other methods, other tests. Other methods\nof achieving effective disinfection and other tests which satisfactorily\ndemonstrate that effective disinfection has been achieved may be approved by\nthe commission. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n861.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
