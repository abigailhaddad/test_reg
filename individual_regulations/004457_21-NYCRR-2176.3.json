  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 2176.3 - Rules and regulations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Payment request procedure. (1)\n\nMost\ncontractors who are owed money by the agency shall send a proper invoice to the\nattention of Accounts Payable, the designated payment department of the agency. Accounts Payable will log the reception date of the invoice, and send the\ndocument to the unit within the agency that received the purchased goods, property or services from the contractor for review and verification. (2)\nA small group of contractors will not\nhave to request payment because their contracts provide for automatic payment\nat predetermined intervals without the necessity of an invoice. Accordingly, review and verification of the work of these contractors will take place prior\nto each scheduled payment date. (b) Schedule for prompt payment. The agency\nwill adhere to the following schedule for prompt payment: (1)\n\nFor invoices received between April 29, 1988 and July 1, 1989, payment will be made within 45 calendar days after\nreceipt of a proper invoice. (2)\n\nFor invoices received after July 1, 1989, payment will be made within 30\ncalendar days, excluding legal holidays, after receipt of a proper\ninvoice. (3)\n\nFor contracts with\npredetermined payment dates, payment will be made on each such date. This schedule will not apply in those instances where\npayment is being delayed for any of the exceptions listed in subdivision (e) or\ntolled for any of the reasons listed in subdivision (f) of this section. (c) Interest\ncomputation. If the agency fails to meet the prompt payment schedule set in\nthis section, the agency will pay interest to the affected contractors at the\nrate equal to that set by the State Tax Commission for corporate\ntaxes. (d) Funds available to pay\ninterest penalties. The agency will pay penalties with monies drawn from\nearnings on investments, and agency fees and charges for both personal services\ncontracts and nonpersonal services contracts, the two types of contracts\nentered into by the agency. (e) Situations which justify extension of payment time for proper invoices. The\nfollowing facts or conditions constitute exceptions to the prompt payment\nschedule set forth in subdivision (b) of this section: (1)\nstatutory or contract provisions\nrequiring an inspection or an audit prior to payment; (2)\na requirement for State appropriation to\nauthorize payment; (3)\na\nrequirement for Federal government examination of a proper invoice prior to\npayment; (4)\nextraordinary delay\nbetween the provision of goods, property or services by a contractor and the\nreceipt of a proper invoice by the agency; and\n(5)\nfailure by a contractor to submit\ndocuments required by agreement prior to payment. In addition, the agency is not responsible for the\nprocessing time taken by the State Department of Taxation and Finance, the\n\nState Division of the Budget, the Office of the State Comptroller, or any other\nexternal entity that is required by statute or regulation to approve or process\nagency payments. (f) Reasons which justify the tolling of\npayment time for invoices. The following facts or conditions toll the prompt\npayment schedule set forth in subdivision (b) of this section: (1)\nthe existence of defects in the goods, property or services delivered; (2)\nthe existence of defects in the invoice; and\n(3)\nsuspected improprieties of any\nkind. (g) Tolling\nregulations. In order to toll the prompt payment schedule without penalty, the\nagency has 15 days after receipt of an invoice to send a contractor\nnotification of defects or improprieties. Agency notification shall be in the\nform of a standardized letter. In the event that the agency fails to act within\n15 days, once the defect or impropriety is corrected, the number of days\nallowed for payment is reduced by the number of days between the 15th day and\nthe date of notification. In the event that the agency's contentions are proved\nunreasonable, the date by which contract payment shall be made is calculated\nfrom the date of receipt of invoice. For those contracts which provide for\nscheduled payments without an invoice, the same 15-day regulations\napply. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.

More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
