  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 300.32 - Designation of a legally responsible person for a minor claimant\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A person\nlegally responsible for a minor claimant means a natural or adoptive parent, stepparent or other relative who has custody of the claimant, or a\ncourt-appointed guardian. (b) The\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law judge, in any workers' compensation case in which an\naward of compensation made on or after January 1, 1989 is payable in whole or\nin part to a minor claimant, may, upon request of a person legally responsible\nfor such claimant, designate such legally responsible person as payee to\nreceive payments for the benefit of the minor claimant. Such designation shall\nbe made at the same time the award is made. (c) Notwithstanding a request by a person\nlegally responsible for a minor claimant to be designated as payee to receive\npayments of compensation for the benefit of the minor claimant, the Workers'\nCompensation Law judge, when making an award to the minor claimant, may refuse\nto designate such legally responsible person as payee and may instead direct\nthat payment of the award be made directly to the minor claimant. In making a\ndetermination whether to direct payment to the minor claimant, the Workers'\nCompensation Law judge may consider the ability of the minor claimant to manage\nthe benefit payments in his or her own interest. (d) A legally responsible person duly\ndesignated by a Workers' Compensation Law judge as a payee to receive payments\nfor the benefit of such minor claimant has a responsibility to: (1)\nuse such payments solely for the benefit\nof the minor claimant in a manner he or she determines to be in the best\ninterest of the claimant; (2)\nnotify the board of any event that will affect the amount of payments the minor\nclaimant receives or the right of the minor claimant to receive\npayments; (3)\nnotify the board of\nany change in his or her circumstances that would affect the performance of his\nor her responsibilities as payee; (4)\nsubmit to the chair, annually, or more\noften if required by the chair, a written report accounting for the payments\nreceived. Such report shall show: (i) the\namount of benefit payments on hand at the beginning of the accounting\nperiod; (ii)\nthe amount of benefit\npayments received during the accounting period; (iii)\nhow the benefit payments were\nused; (iv)\nthe balance on hand at\nthe end of the accounting period; (v) where the minor claimant lived during the\naccounting period. A report made pursuant to this section shall be on a form\nprescribed by the chair, except that a guardian of the property of a minor\nappointed by a court of competent jurisdiction, if required to file an annual\naccounting report to such court, shall be deemed to comply with the\nrequirements of this section by filing a copy of such report with the\nboard. (e) If the Workers' Compensation Law judge\nfinds after a hearing that the legally responsible person designated as payee\nto receive payments for the benefit of the minor claimant is using the payments\nfor purposes other than the benefit of the claimant, the Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw judge shall revoke the designation of such legally responsible person as\npayee and shall either appoint a new payee, who shall be a person legally\nresponsible for the minor claimant as defined in subdivision (a) of this\nsection or such other suitable person who is responsible for, or contributing\nto, the care, maintenance or support of the minor claimant as the board may\ndeem appropriate, or direct that payments be made directly to the minor\nclaimant, in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section.
