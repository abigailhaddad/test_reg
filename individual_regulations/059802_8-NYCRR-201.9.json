(b) Procedures for\nremovals other than suspensions. A removal of a student with a disability, as\ndefined in section\n201.2\n(l) of this\n\nPart, to which the provisions of paragraphs (a) through (d) of subdivision 3 of\nsection\n3214\nof the\n\nEducation Law do not apply, other than a change in placement to an IAES, shall\nbe conducted in accordance with the due process procedures applicable to such\nremovals of nondisabled students, except that school personnel may not impose\nsuch removal for more than 10 consecutive days or for a period that would\nresult in a disciplinary change in placement, unless there has been a\ndetermination that the behavior is not a manifestation of the student's\ndisability. The removal of a student with a disability to an IAES shall be\nconducted in accordance with the applicable provisions of section\n201.7\n(e) of this\n\nPart and paragraph (c)(3) of this section, or of section\n201.8\nof this Part. (c) Procedures for suspensions of more than\nfive school days (superintendent's hearings). Superintendent's hearings on\ndisciplinary charges against students with disabilities and students presumed\nto have a disability for discipline purposes shall be bifurcated into a guilt\nphase and a penalty phase and conducted in accordance with the following\nprocedures: (1)\n\nThe superintendent of schools\nor hearing officer in the superintendent's hearing shall proceed with the guilt\nphase and determine whether the student is guilty of the alleged misconduct. If\nit is determined that the student is guilty of the alleged misconduct, the\nsuperintendent of schools or hearing officer in the superintendent's hearing\nshall make a threshold determination of whether a suspension or removal in\nexcess of 10 consecutive school days or that would otherwise constitute a\ndisciplinary change in placement should be considered. If the threshold\ndetermination is that such a suspension or removal should be considered, before\nthe superintendent of schools orders or the hearing officer in the\nsuperintendent's hearing recommends any such removal, the superintendent's\nhearing shall be adjourned until a manifestation determination is made by the\nmanifestation team, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision. If the superintendent of schools or hearing officer in the\nsuperintendent's hearing determines that a suspension or removal that would\nconstitute a disciplinary change in placement should not be considered, the\nhearing shall proceed to the penalty phase. (2)\n\nUpon a determination by the manifestation\nteam that the behavior of a student with a disability was not a manifestation\nof the student's disability, such student may be disciplined in the same manner\nas a nondisabled student, except that such student shall continue to receive\nservices in accordance with section\n201.10\nof this Part. Upon receipt\nof notice of such determination, the superintendent or hearing officer in the\nsuperintendent' s hearing shall proceed with the penalty phase of the hearing. If the manifestation team determines that the behavior was a manifestation of\nthe student's disability, the superintendent or hearing officer in the\nsuperintendent's hearing shall dismiss the superintendent's hearing, except as\notherwise provided in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision, if the superintendent or hearing\nofficer in the superintendent's hearing is considering the change in placement\nof a student with a disability to an IAES pursuant to section\n201.7\n(e) of this\n\nPart, upon a determination that the student is guilty of the alleged misconduct\nrelating to serious bodily injury, weapons, illegal drugs or controlled\nsubstances, the superintendent of schools may order, or the hearing officer in\nthe superintendent's hearing may recommend, such change in placement to an\nIAES, to be determined by the CSE, for up to 45 school days, but not to exceed\nthe length of time that a nondisabled student would be suspended for the same\nmisconduct under the school district's student discipline policy. The\nsuperintendent of schools may order such change in placement of a student with\na disability to an IAES, directly or upon recommendation of a hearing officer\nin the superintendent's hearing, even where the manifestation team determines\nthat the student's behavior is a manifestation of the student's\ndisability. (4)\n\nThe penalty phase\nof a superintendent's hearing for a student with a disability or a student\npresumed to have a disability for discipline purposes shall be conducted in the\nsame manner as the penalty phase of a hearing involving a nondisabled student, including the admission of anecdotal evidence of past instances of misconduct. The school district shall assure that copies of the special education and\ndisciplinary records of the student are transmitted to the superintendent of\nschools or hearing officer in the superintendent's hearing for consideration. Such records shall be transmitted whether or not the manifestation team has\ndetermined that the student's behavior is a manifestation of the student's\ndisability. (5)\n\nNothing in this\nsection shall be construed to authorize the suspension or removal of a student\nwith a disability from his or her current educational placement for violation\nof school rules following a determination by the manifestation team that the\nbehavior is a manifestation of the student's disability, except where the\nstudent is placed in an IAES for behavior involving serious bodily injury, weapons, illegal drugs or controlled substances pursuant to section\n201.7\n(e) of this\n\nPart or the student is placed in an IAES by an impartial hearing officer\npursuant to section\n201.8\nof this Part.
