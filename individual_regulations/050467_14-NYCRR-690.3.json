  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 690.3 - Intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Principles of compliance. (1)\n\nThe day treatment facility is required to provide or ensure provision of a\nplanned combination of diagnostic, treatment and habilitation services in\naccordance with the comprehensive functional assessment (see glossary) of each\nperson's needs. Allowable services (see glossary), delivered by qualified\nprofessionals (see glossary) or appropriately supervised paraprofessional or\ndirect care staff (see glossary), include: (i) independent living services (see\nparagraph [a][2] of this subdivision); (ii)\nmedical oversight services (see section\n690.5\n[b][1]\nof\nthis Part); (iii)\nnursing\nservices; (iv)\nnutrition\nservices; (v) occupational therapy\nservices; (vi)\nphysical therapy\nservices; (vii)\npsychology\nservices; (viii)\nself-care\nservices; (ix)\nsocial work\nservices; (x) speech pathology\nservices; and\n(xi)\ntherapeutic\nrecreational services. (2)\n\nWhere clinically appropriate, and\nincorporated into the person's individual program plan (see glossary), a day\ntreatment facility may elect to provide, as part of the allowable services in\nthe area of independent living or other category, active treatment-based\nactivities of a therapeutic prevocational nature. Included here, for example, might be training in the performance of an assembly task to improve\nmanipulation skills, training in the performance of a sorting task to improve\ncognitive discrimination skills, etc. However, this excludes those\nactivities/interventions which have a purely vocational (\ni.e., work-for-pay) purpose. Therapeutic prevocational activities are eligible for\nreimbursement through the Medical Assistance Program as part of a day treatment\nfacility's allowable services if: (i) The\nactivities/interventions are documented in a written individual program plan\nand conform to the requirements for the provision of active treatment (see\nglossary). (ii)\n\nThe activities in\nwhich persons are engaged are primarily therapeutic and individualized in\nnature (\ni.e., the treatment goal is the amelioration of a\ndevelopmental skill deficit, or developmental skill enhancement, rather than\nthe production of a product), and the activities are chosen, approved or\ndeveloped by the interdisciplinary treatment team (see glossary) on the basis\nof clinical judgement related to the person's needs. (iii)\n\nThe activities engaged in are not\nperformed as part of contract work (see glossary) for which the day treatment\nfacility in particular, has made any commitments for itself, its staff, or the\nparticipants. (iv)\n\nThe activities\nengaged in by persons at the facility do not generate any outside income which\naccrues to the day treatment facility. (v) In accordance with the Department of\n\nLabor regulations, if the therapeutic activity/intervention results in a\nsaleable product or an economic benefit to any party, the person(s) must be\nrecompensed in accordance with New York State's Wage and Hour Law\nrequirements. (3)\n\nAs\npart of the day treatment facility's reimbursement, allowable services shall be\nprovided as needed on a regular basis (though not necessarily on a daily\nbasis), to person(s)/people attending the day treatment facility in accordance\nwith an individual program plan and, in the case of occupational and physical\ntherapy, by specific written medical prescription. (i) The frequency and intensity of service\ndelivery shall be based on the needs indicated in each person's comprehensive\nfunctional assessment. (ii)\n\nMedical\noversight, nursing, psychology, social work, speech pathology, occupational\ntherapy and physical therapy services as specified in the program plans of the\nfacility's participants, may be provided directly or through contract or letter\nof agreement, but the costs for such services are to be considered as part of\nthe day treatment facility's reimbursement. (iii)\n\nTransportation to and from the facility\nis a separately reimbursable service until June 30, 1996. Effective July 1, 1996, such transportation shall be the responsibility of the day treatment\nprovider. (iv)\n\nThe level of all\nservices provided shall be based on a person's assessed needs and in accordance\nwith the treatment plans (see glossary) contained in the individual program\nplan. (v) The facility shall\nencourage and facilitate the coordination of service delivery among each\nperson's major day and residential providers. (4)\n\nEach of the allowable services set forth\nin this Part shall be provided either directly by the facility or through\ncontract or agreement with other providers, and may be delivered through group\nor individual activities, as indicated in a person's individual program plan. (i) Where required by law, all contractual\nservice providers shall have a valid operating certificate or applicable\nlicensure/certification issued by the appropriate State agency. (ii)\n\nServices provided by the facility or to\nthe facility by outside agencies or parties shall meet the applicable\nrequirements of this Part. Contracts or agreements for these services shall\nstate that these standards will be met. (5)\n\nIt is generally expected that most\nperson(s)/people receiving full or half-day day treatment services are having\ntheir basic needs for day treatment services accommodated. However, it is\nrealized that in individual cases, the person's need for clinical supports may\nextend beyond the day treatment facility's scope or duration of responsibility. In such cases, and in other appropriate circumstances, a person may receive a\nday treatment service and a Part 679 (of this Title) certified clinic treatment\nservice on the same day. In such cases, it shall be the responsibility of both\nthe day treatment and the clinic treatment provider to ensure adherence to\nthese requirements. (i) A person admitted to a\nday treatment facility and receiving full, half or collocated\n(\na.k.a., partial - see section\n690.1\n[d][2]\nof\nthis Title) day treatment services five or fewer days per week, may, as needed, receive a Part 679 clinic treatment service on the same day as the day\ntreatment visit in the clinical areas of audiology, special medical, routine\nmedical, and dentistry without any restriction. This presumes that the person\nreceives the full duration of day treatment visit being claimed, and the clinic\ntreatment service(s) is/are provided outside of the time the person is at the\nday treatment setting. Nothing herein shall preclude such clinical services\nbeing delivered as part of a program plan-specified community integration\nopportunity which meets the requirements of paragraph (6) of this\nsubdivision. (ii)\nA person\nparticipating in fewer than five full days per week of day treatment, may\nreceive a claimable Part 679 (of this Title) clinic treatment service on those\ndays he/she does not attend day treatment. Such clinic service(s) may consist\nof any clinical discipline treatment area(s) deemed necessary and appropriate, other than a comprehensive interdisciplinary assessment (see section\n679.5\n[c][6]\nof\nthis Title). Said comprehensive assessment is required to be provided by the\nday treatment provider as part of its admission and initial and/or annual\nprogramming process. (a) For second opinion\npurposes, and where the person's needs are particularly complex and/or\nintractable or resistive to conventional treatment interventions, a person in\nday treatment may receive a claimable clinic treatment in-depth\ndiscipline-specific assessment visit on a same day he/she is receiving a full\nor half day treatment visit. (b) It\nis expected that the day treatment facility or other referral agent will\nprovide, and that the clinic treatment facility will keep on file, the\ndocumentation substantiating the person's need (\ne.g., diagnostic clarification and/or new treatment recommendations) for the\ndiscipline specific assessment and the reasons why the day treatment facility's\nmeans for this type of assessment are inadequate. Note: Unavailability of day treatment qualified professionals due\nto recruitment problems, is not sufficient justification. (iii)\nA day treatment facility may\nmake arrangements with a clinic treatment facility to provide specific day\ntreatment \"allowable\" services, but only the day treatment facility shall\nsubmit a claim for such services and then must pay the clinic treatment\nfacility provider directly for the service that was provided. (iv)\nA same day clinic visit for any\nauthorized Part 679 (of this Title) clinical service is allowable if the person\nreceiving a full or half day treatment visit also has clinical needs which are\nclearly separate from his/her participation in the day treatment facility\n(\ni.e., related primarily to the person's residence/home). The\nresidential facility's plan of service for the person shall clearly articulate\nthe use of a Part 679 (of this Title) clinic to deliver the\nresidentially-needed clinical support service(s). In addition: (a) For both ICF/DDs and community\nresidences, the residential provider must clearly be able to demonstrate upon\nrequest or audit that the services for which the residential provider is being\nreimbursed through its residential rate/fee, are clearly separate from\n(\ni.e., not duplicative of the additional services received by\nthe person through the Part 679 (of this Title) clinic; (b) All facilities involved (day treatment, clinic treatment, and residence) shall be able to document their efforts at\nintegration and coordination of the services with each other, to ensure that\nthe persons are provided necessary services in the most economical and\nefficient fashion available. (v) A person participating in collocated day\ntreatment (\na.k.a., partial day treatment - see section\n690.1\n[d][2]\nof\nthis Title), may receive a clinic treatment service (other than per\nsubparagraph [i] of this paragraph) only on the days when he/she is not\nreceiving the collocated service. In addition, the clinic service must be\nnecessary to support the person's living situation. (6)\n\nThe provision of isolated, off-site day\ntreatment services is not permitted. However, where clinically appropriate and\nincorporated into the person's individual program plan, a day treatment\nfacility may provide, as part of the allowable services in the area of\nindependent living or other category, an individualized, programmatically sound\ncommunity integration opportunity which extends the facility's habilitation\nenvironment in accordance with the following requirements: (i) The community integration opportunity\nshall be individually, and primarily designed to meet the developmental skill\nor behavioral needs and preferences of the person involved, and shall be\ndocumented in the person's individual program plan. (ii)\n\nThe community integration opportunity\nshall be planned and implemented so that the skill or behavior activities\noriginate at the certified day treatment site (or satellite); that said\nactivities that take place during the period of transportation to the community\nintegration setting; that said activities take place at the setting and during\nthe period of transportation from the setting; and that said activities end at\nthe certified day treatment site (or satellite). Note: This does not presume or require that the same activities, interventions, or skills be conducted/addressed throughout the duration of the\ncommunity integration opportunity or its segments, nor does it presume\ncontinuous interaction. It does presume that the community integration\nopportunity is only part of the person's daily day treatment experience. (iii)\n\nEach particular community\nintegration opportunity (\ni.e., the activity and its associated\noutcome) shall be time limited (as specified by the IT, but in any event, no\nlonger than one year), and focused on the initiation or enhancement of a\nspecific developmental skill(s) or behavior(s) appropriate for increasing the\nperson's independent functioning in the community. Such experiences shall not\nbe for the sole purposes of placing the person in another setting/alternative\nor for facilitating the person's adaptation to a new setting/alternative\nwithout an emphasis on objectives to facilitate specific developmental skill(s)\nor behavior(s). (b) Standards of certification. (1)\nOPWDD shall verify, where community\nintegration opportunities have been utilized, that the appropriate treatment\nplans document the habilitation activities being carried out during the various\nphases of each opportunity. (2)\nOPWDD shall verify that, where applicable, the day treatment program has\ncoordinated the provision of allowable day treatment services with other\nsignificant services received by the person outside of the day treatment\nfacility. (3)\nOPWDD shall verify\nwhere the day treatment facility is utilizing pre-vocational skills training\nmaterials or activities, that said materials/activities are not part of a\ncontract work arrangement that binds the day treatment facility, its staff or\nservice recipients to any production obligations. (4)\nOPWDD shall verify that the outcomes of\nindividualization, inclusion, independence and productivity have been\nconsidered as part of the overall program planning process for the person and\nincorporated, as appropriate, into various treatment activities, interventions\nand/or therapies addressing skill and behavioral development. (5)\nOPWDD shall verify that, where the IT has\nchosen to include pre-vocational services as part of the person's overall day\ntreatment services, the plan for said services includes the clinical\njustification as to why such pre-vocational activities/interventions/therapies\nare appropriate to meeting the person's needs for the time in\nquestion.
