Tit. 10 § 442.19 - Timing differences\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1390 ]\n(a) Timing differences result when accounting\npolicies and practices used in an organization's accounting differ from those\nused for reporting operations to governmental units collecting taxes or to\noutside agencies making payments based upon the reported operations. These\ndifferences must be recorded on the hospital's records when they arise. The\nreferences relative to their acceptable accounting treatment are as follows: -Income tax allocation-\nAccounting Principles\n\nBoard Opinions Nos. 11, 23 and 24. (b) The following condensed income statement\nillustrates a timing difference attributable to different methods of\ncalculating depreciation expense for financial accounting versus tax or\nthird-party reimbursement purposes. (1)\n\nAssumptions: (i) Depreciation for accounting\npurposes is calculated on the straight-line method and amounts to $10 for the\ncurrent year. (ii)\n\nDepreciation for\ntax and third-party reimbursement purposes is calculated on a declining balance\nmethod and amounts to $20 for the current year. (iii)\n\nThe tax rate is 40 percent. (iv)\n\nThe third-party utilization is 50\npercent. (v) The only deduction\nfrom revenue is the contractual allowance. (2)\n\nIncome statement.
