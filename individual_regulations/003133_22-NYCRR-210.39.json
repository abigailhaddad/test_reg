Tit. 22 § 210.39 - Procedures for the enforcement of money judgments under CPLR article 52\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All subpoenas and processes for the examination of judgment debtors or other\npersons, including garnishees, in connection with the enforcement of money\njudgments, as well as adjournments thereof if made returnable in the court, shall be returnable in the appropriate motion part of each City\n\nCourt. (b) All\nsubpoenas and processes for the examination of judgment debtors or other\npersons, including garnishees, if made returnable in the court, shall be filed\nwith the clerk of the appropriate motion part, with proper affidavits of\nservice, at least two court days before the return day, except where service\nwas made too late for filing within such time, in which event filing before the\nhour of the return shall suffice and the clerk shall list all such upon the\ncalendar. Stipulations of adjournments, if attendance in court on the adjourned\ndate is required, shall be similarly filed. Unless so filed, the names of the\nparties shall not be called; nor shall any such names be called unless they\nappear on a written or typewritten calendar. The judge presiding may, upon\nproper proof by affidavit showing good cause for the failure to file in\naccordance with this rule, add any matter to the calendar.

(d) There shall be no more than two\nadjournments of the examination of a judgment debtor or other person, including\na garnishee, unless such additional adjournment is approved and such approval\nis noted on the papers by the judge presiding at a motion part. (e) No motion shall be made upon\nthe basis of any testimony taken in examinations unless and until such\ntestimony has been reduced to writing and unless and until there has been\ncompliance with the requirements of CPLR 5224(e). (f) Every subpoena or other\nprocess providing for the examination of a judgment debtor or other person, including a garnishee, in addition to the other requirements of CPLR 5223, shall have endorsed on its face, in bold type, the words: \"This subpoena or\nprocess (as the case may be) requires your personal appearance at the time and\nplace specified. Failure to appear may subject you to fine and imprisonment for\ncontempt of court.\"\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
