  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 5250.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll law enforcement agencies have a common goal of providing\nthe highest level of police protection to the communities they serve. Fulfilling that goal requires the coordination and cooperation of all law\nenforcement agencies at the local, county and State levels. In the interest of\nproviding the highest levels of law enforcement services and protection to the\npublic, the Legislature has therefore required the 911 Board to adopt minimum\nstandards for jurisdictional protocols. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n5250.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
