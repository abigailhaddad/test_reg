  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 97.14 - Lists of department actions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The purpose of this action is to simplify the tasks of determining whether or not a proposed action may have a significant effect on the environment by identifying actions or classes of actions that are likely to have a significant effect and those which will not have a significant effect. Because of the complex and varied nature of department actions, the lists in this section are not all-inclusive. The omission from the list of an action does not mean that it is exempt from this Part, nor does it mean that it is automatically an action requiring environmental impact statement preparation. The criteria set forth in 6 NYCRR\n617.11\nand section\n97.13\nof this Part shall be used to determine significance with respect to actions not listed in this section. The following system is used in this section: (1)\n\nType I. Actions or classes of actions that are more likely to require preparation of environmental impact statements. (2)\n\nType II. Actions or classes of actions which have been determined not to have a significant effect on the environment and which do not require environmental impact statements under this Part. (3)\n\nUnlisted. Actions or classes of actions, not excluded or exempt, not listed as a type I or type II action in this Part. (b) Lists. Note: This Part does not apply to actions by private persons where ministerial department action is involved. The following lists are intended to cover only actions of the department or actions which must be approved, funded or otherwise acted upon by the department. TYPE I\nType I actions or classes of actions are likely to, but will not necessarily, require preparation of environmental impact statements.
