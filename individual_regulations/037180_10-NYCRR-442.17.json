  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.17 - Inventories\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1370 ]\n(a) Inventories reflect the cost of unused\nhospital supplies. Any generally accepted cost method (\ne.g., FIFO, LIFO, Average, etc.) may be used as long as it is consistent with that of\nthe preceding accounting period. Cost of inventories based on the last invoice\nprice is not an acceptable method for determining such cost. (b) Inventory accounting record systems are\nrequired, consistent with the method of the inventory valuation employed. Perpetual inventory records are recommended but not required. Physical\nvaluations must be made at least once a year and the accounting records, if\napplicable, adjusted to such valuations. (c) Inventory usage records are required to\nbe maintained for all inventories that are distributed and used by more than\none cost center in the hospital. It is recommended that a formal requisition\nsystem be used for this purpose. In all cases, the cost of non-billable\nsupplies used during the period must be distributed to the user cost centers, preferably on a monthly basis. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n442.17\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
