After a charge is filed, the director of PEPR\nshall conduct a review of the charge to determine whether the facts as alleged\nfall within the jurisdiction of the board under the FLFLPA and whether the\nfacts as pleaded support an unfair labor practice charge as set forth in\nsection 704 or 704-b of SERA. If the director of PEPR determines that the\npleaded facts do no support such a charge, or that the charge is so vague that\nthe respondent could not reasonably respond to the charge, the director may\npermit the party to amend the charge to cure such deficiency. Any motions by\nthe parties will be filed subsequent to a case conference with the assigned\nhearing officer. (b) Notice\nof conference. A notice of conference shall be prepared by the\ndirector or a designated hearing officer specifying the time and place for the\nconference and, together with a copy of the charge, shall be served\nelectronically upon the charging party and each named respondent.
