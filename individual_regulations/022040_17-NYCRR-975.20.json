  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 975.20 - Eligibility requirements to insure services are open to the general public\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When a public\ntransportation system requests STOA for (1) a coordinated transportation\nservice as defined in section\n975.4\n(Z), or (2)\nfor any other public transportation service where the service receives fifty\npercent or more of its operating revenue from human service agency contract(s), or (3) where the operator of the bus service was previously or is currently\nproviding substantial services for human service agency(ies), then the public\ntransportation system must develop and adopt a mass transportation service plan\nthat must define and provide the publicly-available information regarding the\nfollowing: (1)\nservice area; (2)\nhours of service operation; (3)\nfares and third-party reimbursement\nrates; (4)\nroutes and\nschedules/timetables (if fixed route service); (5)\nphone number to arrange for service if\ndemand responsive service; (6)\nadvanced reservation requirements, if any; (7)\nmarketing and public information\nregarding service to the general public; (8)\nmeans of restricting access to the\nservice if demand exceeds capacity; (Note: Prioritization procedure for STOA\neligible service cannot give preference to human service agency\nclients.)\n(9)\ndescription of the\nfinancial plan including estimated cost and operating revenue, state, federal, and local financial assistance for the coming fiscal year; (10)\ndescription of any contracts with human\nservice agencies including the amount of compensation, passengers, and whether\nreimbursement is on a per-passenger or other basis; Note: A per-passenger payment from a human service agency\nmay be accepted in lieu of collecting a fare from a human service agency client\n(see section\n975.2\n(d). Where a\npublic transportation system proposes to meet human service agency's\ntransportation needs, the system should carefully review if the service can be\nmet most economically, efficiently, and effectively by an exclusive service\nthat does not receive STOA or as part an open-to-the-public service that is\neligible for STOA. Portions of a service that give preference, or are\nrestricted, to a particular client group (s) are not eligible for STOA.)\n(11)\ncontracts for services; and\n(For coordinated transportation service, one\noperator--preferably the principal operator--must control all transportation\nservice components of the coordinated transportation service system including\nmarketing, scheduling, dispatching operations, and the compilation of federal\nand state reports.)\n(12)\npublic transportation vehicles to be used. (If school buses are to be used, they must be identified in\nthe plan and describe the actions taken to satisfy the provisions of 975.2(b)\nto insure that the service is recognized as open to the general public. If\nvehicles are purchased through the use of federal or state funds, they must be\nidentified. This section of the plan can also contain the material to satisfy\nthe provision of section\n975.2\n(e) regarding vehicle capacity.)\n(b) The plan for services submitted for STOA\nmust be approved by the governing board of the public transportation system. The approving resolution must recognize the service as being fully open to the\ngeneral public on an equal opportunity basis and relevant to the travel needs\nof the general public. (c) The\ncommissioner will review the plan for determining service eligibility for\nSTOA. (d) The transportation\nservice plan developed by public transportation systems for coordinated\ntransportation services under the Rural Public Transportation Coordination\n\nAssistance Program (RPTCAP) may fulfill the requirements of this\nsection. (e) Where a public\ntransportation system provides both open-to-the-general-public and specialized\nservice, the transportation service plan requirements of this section and\nsection\n975.19\ncan be met in a single\ndocument. (f) New systems must\nsubmit their plans sixty days prior to the effective date of STOA eligible\nservice. Systems currently receiving STOA must submit their plan within 180\ndays of the effective date of these regulations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
