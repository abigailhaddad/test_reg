  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 182.17 - Experimental Population Designation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Experimental populations are designated\nby the department through the following process: (1)\nA proposal is prepared that meets the\nfollowing criteria: (i) The proposal must\nidentify the species and define the experimental population area covered by the\nexperimental population designation. (ii)\n\nExperimental population areas must be\ngeographically distinct from existing habitat occupied by the target species. The boundaries of experimental population areas will follow existing county, town, village and water body boundaries to the maximum extent\npracticable. (iii)\n\nTo be considered\nas an experimental population area, the department must conclude that enough\nsuitable habitat, in terms of quantity, quality, and existing protected status, exists in the geographic area to be designated such that the likelihood of\nsuccessful establishment is reasonably assured. (2)\n\nThe department will publish the proposal\nin the Environmental Notice Bulletin and provide notice of publication to the\nchief executive officer(s) of the municipality or municipalities in the\naffected geographic area identified in the proposal. (3)\n\nUpon publication in the Environmental\n\nNotice Bulletin, there will be a 30-day public comment period that begins on\nthe day of publication. (4)\n\nUpon\ncompletion of the public comment period, the department will make a decision to\nadopt, modify or reject the proposal. (5)\n\nIf the department modifies the proposal, it will republish the modified proposal and resume the process as indicated in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. (6)\n\nIf the department adopts the proposal, the experimental population designation becomes official upon the date of\npublication by the department of its decision to adopt the proposal in the\n\nEnvironmental Notice Bulletin. (b) Once designated as an experimental\npopulation, that designation continues until the species is removed from the\nlist of threatened and endangered species in section 182.5 of this\n\nPart. (c) Animals of a listed\nspecies that occur within an experimental population area designated for that\nspecies are protected wildlife pursuant to section 11-0103(6)(c) of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law and are protected from intentional take, but\ntheir presence cannot be used to identify occupied habitat for regulatory\npurposes within the experimental population area.
