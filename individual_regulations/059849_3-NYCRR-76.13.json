(b) Data reporting. The Banking\n\nDepartment's approval of a plan does not affect the banking institution's\nobligation, if any, to report other required data. (c) Plans in general. (1)\n\nTerm. A plan may have a term of no more\nthan five years, and any multi-year plan must include annual interim measurable\ngoals under which the Department will evaluate the banking institution's\nperformance. (2)\n\nMultiple\nassessment areas. A banking institution with more than one assessment area may\nprepare a single plan for all of its assessment areas or one or more plans for\none or more of its assessment areas. (3)\n\nTreatment of affiliates. Affiliated\ninstitutions may prepare a joint plan if the plan provides measurable goals for\neach institution. Activities may be allocated among institutions at the\ninstitutions' option, provided that the same activities are not considered for\nmore than one institution. (d) Public participation in plan development. Before submitting a plan to the Banking Department for approval, a banking\ninstitution shall: (1)\ninformally seek\nsuggestions from members of the public in its assessment area(s) covered by the\nplan while developing the plan; (2)\nonce the banking institution has developed a plan, formally solicit public\ncomment on the plan for at least 30 days by publishing notice in at least one\nnewspaper of general circulation in each assessment area covered by the plan; and\n(3)\nduring the period of formal\npublic comment, make copies of the plan available for review by the public at\nno cost at all offices of the banking institution in any assessment area\ncovered by the plan and provide copies of the plan upon request for a\nreasonable fee to cover copying and mailing, if applicable. (e) Submission of plan. The\nbanking institution shall submit its plan to the Banking Department at least\nthree months prior to the proposed effective date of the plan. The banking\ninstitution shall also submit with its plan a description of its informal\nefforts to seek suggestions from members of the public, any written public\ncomment received, and, if the plan was revised in light of the comment\nreceived, the initial plan as released for public comment. (f) Plan content. The content of the plan\nshall be as follows: (1)\n\nMeasurable goals.

(ii)\nA banking\ninstitution shall address in its plan all three performance categories and, unless the banking institution has been designated as a wholesale or limited\npurpose banking institution, shall emphasize lending and lending-related\nactivities. Nevertheless, a different emphasis, including a focus on one or\nmore performance categories, may be appropriate if responsive to the\ncharacteristics and credit needs of its assessment area(s), considering public\ncomment and the banking institution's capacity and constraints, product\nofferings, and business strategy. (2)\n\nConfidential information. A banking\ninstitution may submit additional information to the Department on a\nconfidential basis, but the goals stated in the plan must be sufficiently\nspecific to enable the public and the Department to judge the merits of the\nplan. (3)\n\nSatisfactory and\noutstanding goals. A banking institution shall specify in its plan measurable\ngoals that constitute \"satisfactory\" performance. A plan may specify measurable\ngoals that constitute \"outstanding\" performance. If a banking institution\nsubmits, and the Department approves, both \"satisfactory\" and \"outstanding\"\nperformance goals, the Department will consider the banking institution\neligible for an \"outstanding\" performance rating. (4)\n\nElection if satisfactory goals not\nsubstantially met. A banking institution may elect in its plan that, if the\nbanking institution fails to meet substantially its plan goals for a\nsatisfactory rating, the Department will evaluate the banking institution's\nperformance under the lending, investment, and service tests, the community\ndevelopment test, or the small banking institution performance standards, as\nappropriate. (g) Plan\napproval. Approval of a plan shall be as follows: (1)\n\nTiming. The Department will act upon a\nplan within 60 calendar days after receipt of the complete plan and other\nmaterial required under subdivision (e) of this section.

In evaluating the\nplan's goals, the Department considers the public's involvement in formulating\nthe plan, written public comment on the plan, and any response by the banking\ninstitution to public comment on the plan. (3)\n\nCriteria for evaluating plan. The\n\nDepartment evaluates a plan's measurable goals using the following criteria, as\nappropriate: (i) the extent and breadth of\nlending or lending-related activities, including, as appropriate, the\ndistribution of loans among different geographies, businesses and farms of\ndifferent sizes, and individuals of different income levels, the extent of\nlending to minority- and women-owned businesses, the extent of community\ndevelopment lending, and the use of innovative or flexible lending practices to\naddress credit needs; (ii)\nthe\namount and innovativeness, complexity, and responsiveness of the banking\ninstitution's qualified investments; and\n(iii)\nthe availability and effectiveness of\nthe banking institution's systems for delivering retail banking services and\nthe extent and innovativeness of the banking institution's community\ndevelopment services.
