A sidewalk shed constructed in accordance with the provisions\nof this section shall be required along any sidewalk or thoroughfare where the\nfollowing conditions persist: (1)\n\nWhere any\nbuilding or other structure exceeding 40 feet in height above and alongside of\nsuch sidewalk or thoroughfare is to be erected. (2)\n\nWhere any building or other structure\nexceeding 25 feet in height above such sidewalk or thoroughfare is to be\ndemolished and the distance from such sidewalk or thoroughfare to the nearest\npoint of such building or other structure is one-half or less of the height of\nsuch building or other structure. (3)\n\nWhere during construction or demolition\noperations, material or debris is to be transported over such sidewalk or\nthoroughfare, regardless of the height of the building or other structure being\nconstructed or demolished. (b) Sidewalk shed construction. (1)\n\nThe deck and supporting structure of\nevery sidewalk shed shall be constructed to sustain a live load of at least 150\npounds per square foot without breaking, and if material is to be stored\nthereon such deck and supporting structure shall be constructed to sustain a\nlive load of not less than 300 pounds per square foot without breaking. Every\nsidewalk shed shall be so erected as to provide a vertical clearance of not\nless than seven and one-half feet at any point above the walkway surface. Every\nsidewalk shed shall have such width as to allow the unimpeded passage of\npedestrians at all times but in no case shall any sidewalk shed be less than\nfive feet wide. (2)\n\nThe outside\nedge and the ends of the deck of every sidewalk shed shall be provided with a\nsubstantial enclosure at least 42 inches in height, consisting of boards not\nless than one inch thick laid close, or of screening formed of not less than\n\nNo. 16 U.S. gage steel wire mesh with openings which will reject a one and\none-half inch diameter ball, or of corrugated metal sheet of not less than No. 22 U.S. gage or of exterior grade plywood not less than one-half inch\nthick. (3)\n\nThe deck of every\nsidewalk shed shall consist of planks not less than two inches thick full size\nlaid tight. Unless such deck is constructed solidly against the face of the\nbuilding or other structure in such manner that no material, debris or other\nobjects can fall on the sidewalk or other walkway surface, the side of the shed\ntoward the building or other structure shall be solidly fenced with a barricade\nfor its full height. Solid sliding or swinging gates or doors may be provided\nfor the movement of men and materials. (4)\n\nMetal or other materials of equivalent\nstrength and suitability may be used in lieu of wood in the construction of\nsidewalk sheds. (5)\n\nSidewalk sheds\nshall be provided with illumination having an intensity of not less than\nfive-foot candles measured at the walkway level to insure the safe movement of\npersons. (c) Barricades. (1)\n\nAlong every sidewalk or pedestrian\nthoroughfare where a building or other structure is to be constructed or\ndemolished and where a sidewalk shed is not required by this Part (rule), there\nshall be erected a substantial barricade to prevent unauthorized persons from\nentering the site of such operations. (2)\n\nSuch barricade shall be a fence or\nequivalent barrier not less than six feet in height. Such barricade shall be of\nsolid construction for its entire height and length except for such openings, provided with solid doors, as may be necessary for the proper performance of\nthe work. (3)\n\nWhere the height of\nthe building or other structure to be constructed or demolished is not more\nthan 25 feet above the ground, grade or equivalent surface and where the\ndistance from the sidewalk or pedestrian thoroughfare to the nearest point of\nsuch building or other structure is more than one half of the height of the\nbuilding or other structure, a substantial safety railing constructed in\ncompliance with this Part (rule) may be installed at the inside edge of such\nsidewalk or pedestrian thoroughfare in lieu of such solid barricade.
