  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 25.27 - Incapacitated employees\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When there is reason to believe that\nan employee to whom the disciplinary procedures of section\n25.29\nof this Part apply is\nphysically or mentally disabled from performing, with or without reasonable\naccommodation, the essential functions of his or her position, the appropriate\nadministrative authority may require such employee to undergo a physical or\npsychiatric examination at the expense of the State, to be conducted by a\nmedical officer selected by the Chief Administrator, to establish whether he or\nshe is able to perform, with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential\nfunctions of his or her position or whether his or her continued presence on\nthe job creates a significant risk to the health or safety of the individual or\nof others that cannot be eliminated with reasonable accommodation. For purposes\nof this section, the appropriate administrative authority shall be the\ndesignating authority set forth in section\n25.29\n(b) of this\n\nPart. If, upon such medical examination, the medical officer certifies that\neither condition exists, the employee shall be placed on leave of absence\nwithout pay subject to the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section. An\nemployee placed on such leave shall be allowed to draw accumulated and unused\nsick leave, annual leave, compensatory time, overtime credits and other time\nallowances standing to his or her credit prior to being placed on such leave. An employee who chooses to draw his or her accumulated leave credits under this\nsection shall cease to earn and accrue sick and annual leave credits during\nthat period. (b) When\nan employee who is not permanently incapacitated from performing the duties of\nhis or her position has been absent from and unable to perform the duties of\nhis or her position by reason of sickness or disability either for a\nconsecutive period of one year or more or for a cumulative total of 250\nworkdays or more within a period of 24 consecutive calendar months, and who\nreasonably cannot be expected to be able to resume performing, with or without\nreasonable accommodation, the essential functions of his or her position\nshortly thereafter, his or her employment may be terminated by the appropriate\nadministrative authority and the position may be filled by a permanent\nappointment. (c) Prior to being placed on leave pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, or\nterminated pursuant to subdivision (b), an employee shall be provided with\nwritten notice thereof, including written notice of the facts relied on\ntherefor and written notice of the employee's right to contest the\ndetermination and of the procedures for doing so. Such notice shall be served\nin person or by first class, registered or certified mail, return receipt\nrequested, upon the employee. If such person elects to contest the\ndetermination, he or she shall file a written request for a hearing with the\nappropriate administrative authority within 10 workdays from service of the\nnotice of the determination to be reviewed. The request for such hearing shall\nbe filed by the employee personally or by first class, certified or registered\nmail, return receipt requested. Upon receipt of such request, the appropriate\nadministrative authority shall supply to the employee, or his or her personal\nphysician or authorized representative, copies of all diagnoses, test results, observations and other data supporting the determination, and imposition of the\nleave or termination shall be held in abeyance until a final determination is\nmade by the appropriate administrative authority as provided in subdivision (d)\nof this section. (d) A hearing shall be held by a hearing officer designated for that purpose by the\nappropriate administrative authority. The hearing officer shall be vested with\nall the powers of the administrative authority and shall make a record of the\nhearing which shall, with his or her recommendation, be referred to the\nadministrative authority for review and decision and which shall be provided to\nthe employee free of charge. The employee shall, upon request, receive a copy\nof the transcript of the hearing without charge. The employee may be\nrepresented at the hearing by counsel or an authorized representative and may\npresent medical experts and other witnesses or evidence. The burden of proving\nmental or physical unfitness shall be upon the administrative authority. Compliance with technical rules of evidence shall not be required. The\nadministrative authority shall render a final determination and may either\nuphold the original notice of leave of absence, withdraw such notice or modify\nthe notice as appropriate. A final determination of an employee's request for\nreview shall contain notice to the employee of his or her right to appeal from\nsuch determination and of the procedures for perfecting such appeal. (e) If the employee elects to\nappeal, he or she shall make application to the Chief Administrator. The\nemployee shall be afforded an opportunity to present facts and arguments, including medical evidence, in support of his or her position at a time and\nplace and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Chief Administrator. The\n\nChief Administrator shall make a determination on the basis of the medical\nrecords and such facts and arguments as are presented. (f) An employee placed on leave\npursuant to this section may, within one year of the commencement of such\nleave, make application to the appropriate administrative authority for a\nmedical examination to be conducted by a medical officer selected for the\npurpose by the Chief Administrator. If, upon such medical examination, the\nmedical officer shall certify that the employee is physically and mentally fit\nto perform, with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential functions\nhis or her former position, he or she shall be reinstated to the former\nposition, if vacant, or to a vacancy in a similar position or a position in a\nlower title in the same occupational field in his or her former promotion unit. If no appropriate vacancy shall exist to which such reinstatement may be made, or if the work load does not warrant the filing of such vacancy, the name of\nthe employee shall be placed on a preferred list for his or her former position\nin his or her former promotion unit, and the employee shall be eligible for\nreinstatement in such former promotion unit from such preferred list for a\nperiod of four years. In the event that the employee is reinstated in a\nposition in a title lower than that of his or her former position, his or her\nname shall be placed on the preferred eligible list for the former position or\nany similar position in such former promotion unit. (g) An employee placed on leave\npursuant to this section who is not reinstated within one year after the date\nof commencement of such leave, may be terminated by the appropriate\nadministrative authority and his or her position may be filled by permanent\nappointment. (h) An\nemployee whose employment status has been terminated pursuant to subdivision\n(b) or (g) of this section may, within one year after the termination of his or\nher disability, make application to the appropriate appointing authority for a\nmedical examination and subsequent reinstatement pursuant to the procedures and\nconditions of subdivision (f) of this section. (i) Where the continued presence of an\nemployee on the job creates a significant risk to the health or safety of the\nindividual or of others that cannot be eliminated with reasonable\naccommodation, or would significantly interfere with operations, the\nappropriate administrative authority may place such employee on an involuntary\nleave of absence without pay immediately; provided, however, that the employee\nshall be entitled to draw all accumulated and unused sick leave, annual leave, compensatory time, overtime credits and other time allowances standing to his\nor her credit. An employee so placed on leave shall thereafter be subject to\nall of the procedures of this section for placement on leave of absence, except\nthat imposition of such leave shall not be held in abeyance pursuant to\nsubdivision (c) of this section. If it is finally determined pursuant to\nsubdivision (d) of this section, that the employee was physically and mentally\nfit to perform, with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential\nfunctions of his or her position, he or she shall be restored to his or her\nposition and shall have any leave credits or salary that he or she may have\nlost because of such involuntary leave of absence restored, less any\ncompensation he or she may have earned in other employment or occupation and\nany unemployment benefits he or she may have received during such\nperiod. (j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, when an employee's\ndisability is of such a nature as to permanently incapacitate him or her from\nthe performance, with or without reasonable accommodation, the essential\nfunctions of his or her position, his or her employment status may be\nterminated once he or she has exhausted any workers' compensation leave to\nwhich he or she may be entitled pursuant to section\n24.5\nof this Title, and his or her\nposition may be filled by a permanent appointment. (k) This section shall not be\nconstrued to require the extension of any employment beyond the time at which\nit would otherwise terminate by operation of law, rule or regulation, nor shall\nthis section be deemed to modify or supersede any other provisions of law\napplicable to the reemployment of persons retired from the public service on\naccount of disability.
