  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7.6 - Executive order no. 6: ensuring the cost-effectiveness of contracts for personal services\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the State of New York has a talented and\nexperienced work force of public employees; and\nWHEREAS, state agencies must nonetheless sometimes enter\ninto contracts with private entities to perform work on behalf of the State; and\nWHEREAS, agencies should enter into private contracts only\nafter consideration of whether state employees can practicably meet the same\nneed by providing services of the same or better quality for equivalent cost; and\nWHEREAS, the state should encourage transparency and\nopenness in contractual relationships between state agencies and private\nparties, to allow for appropriate public scrutiny. NOW, THEREFORE, I, David A. Paterson, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nthe laws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: A. Definitions\n1. \"State agency\" shall mean any state\nagency, department, office, board, bureau, division, committee, council or\noffice. 2. \"Qualified Personal\n\nServices Contract\" (\"QPSC\") shall mean any contract entered into by a state\nagency with any private party pursuant to State Finance Law § 163, under\nwhich: (a) the agency believes that a\nmajority of the costs of the contract are attributable to compensation of the\ncontractor's personnel; and\n(b) the agency can reasonably anticipate it will incur costs for the compensation\nof personnel of $1 million or more over any twelve-month period. QPSCs shall\ninclude contracts whose primary purpose is evaluation, research and analysis, data processing, computer programming, engineering, environmental assessment, health and mental health services, accounting, auditing, or similar services. A\nQPSC shall not include any contract for the provision of legal services or any\nother services used in or in preparation for the conduct of litigation, including any contract with any consultant or expert witness. B. Establishment of\n\nTask Force\n1. There is hereby established the\n\nGovernor's Task Force on Personal Services Contracting (\"Task\n\nForce\"). 2. The Task Force shall\ninclude the following individuals or their designees: the Director of the\n\nBudget, the Deputy Secretary for Labor and Finance, the Deputy Secretary for\n\nEconomic Development and Infrastructure, the Commissioner of the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance, the Director of the Governor's Office of Employee\n\nRelations, the Commissioner of the Department of Civil Service, and the Chief\n\nInformation Officer. The Director of the Budget shall serve as the chair of the\n\nTask Force. C. Contracting Criteria\n1. A state agency shall\nnot enter into a QPSC unless the agency has first determined that: (a) the contractor can carry out the task\nmore efficiently or effectively than state employees; (b) the contractor can carry out the task for\nlower cost than such state employees; or\n(c) the contract is necessary to protect\npublic health or safety, or for some other compelling reason. 2. A QPSC shall presumptively\nsatisfy the determination required by Section C(1) of this order if: a. a QPSC would result in an improvement in\nservices that cannot be provided by such state employees; b. the services at issue are incidental to a\ncontract for real or personal property, including agreements to service owned, leased or rented equipment; c. a\nQPSC is necessary to avoid a conflict of interest or to obtain an outside or\nindependent perspective; d. the\nservices at issue cannot feasibly be performed by public employees in the\nlocation where they are to be performed; e. use of state employees of the agency\nconducting the procurement will result in delay that will impair the purposes\nof the contract; f. the contract\nwill result in cost savings; g. state employees who can perform the contract are not readily available, and\nbudget restrictions or legal constraints on hiring do not allow for the hiring\nof sufficient public employees as would be necessary to carry out the work; or\nh. for any other reason the Task\n\nForce shall identify and make available for public disclosure. 3. For any QPSC, the relevant\nagency shall provide the Task Force with a brief description of the contract, and the reason for not using state employees to carry out the task. The agency\nshall provide a full copy of the contract to the Task Force upon\nrequest. 4. If the reason for\nentering into a QPSC is cost savings, the agency shall provide information that\nreasonably supports its conclusion, including any data or analysis relied on by\nthe agency. 5. If the QPSC is for\ninformation technology consultants, the agency shall state that it has fully\ncomplied with the procurement review processes of the Office for\n\nTechnology. 6. If the reason for\nthe QPSC is not among those set forth in Section C(2) of this order, it shall\nbe reviewed by the Task Force, which may subsequently, through communications\nwith the agency at issue, or with all agencies entering into QPSCs: (a) add the reason to those presumptively\npermissible; or\n(b) indicate that\nthe Task Force does not deem the reason given an appropriate basis for entering\ninto this kind of contract in the future. 7. If the agency is unable to submit the\ninformation required by Sections C(3) or C(4) of this order, as applicable, within ten business days after the contract was entered into, it shall do so as\nsoon as practicable, along with an explanation of the reason for the\ndelay. D. Operation of\nthe Task Force\n1. The Task Force shall meet\nat least quarterly to review the information provided under this order. It may, in its discretion and in furtherance of the purposes of this order: a. ask for additional information from the\nrelevant agency; b. request such\nassistance from other state agencies or personnel as may be necessary to\ncarrying out its tasks under this order, which assistance shall be\nprovided; c. solicit information\nfrom third parties, including the contracting party, which may be useful in\nevaluating the agency's decision to enter into a QPSC; or\nd. provide recommendations to agencies for\nchanges in their contracting procedures, including recommendations that\nagencies no longer enter into QPSCs for the services at issue, or not do so\nunder certain circumstances. 2. Members of the Task Force shall recuse\nthemselves in discussions regarding contracts entered into by the agency they\nrepresent. 3. The Task Force may, by specific written request to the relevant agency, ask for any information\nrelevant to this order regarding any QPSC the agency has entered into in the\npast that is relevant to any present QPSC, which information shall be provided. The Task Force may also take any of the actions provided for in Section D(1) of\nthis order in regard to any such prior contract. 4. All agencies that enter into QPSCs covered\nby this order shall make available on their websites a list of such contracts, and any amendments to such contracts, along with the estimated amount of the\ncontract and a brief description of the reason for entering into the contract. The agency shall make available such contracts to the public either by: (a) posting the contract in an accessible\nlocation on the agency website; or\n(b) indicating on the web page containing the\nlist of contracts that it will send a copy of the contract to anyone who\nrequests it, for which such agency may charge the reasonable cost of copying. The agency shall redact from any publicly disclosed contract the name or social\nsecurity number of any employee that is included in such document, and any\ninformation that would not be required to be disclosed under the Freedom of\n\nInformation Law. 5. On\n\nOctober 1, 2009 and every year thereafter, the Task Force shall report to the\n\nGovernor on QPSCs. That report shall be made available to the public and shall\ncontain: a. a summary of the information\nobtained by the Task Force under this order; b. a listing of all QPSCs that the Task Force\nhas reviewed; c. an evaluation, as\nto all QPSCs, of the reason given for contracting out, and other potential\nmeans of addressing that reason; d. any conclusions by the Task Force as to whether any QPSCs did not meet the\ncriteria set forth in this order, and as to whether any of the contracts\nrequire further review; and\ne. any\nadditional recommendations, relevant to the Task Force's\nresponsibilities. 6. In\nits initial report on October 1, 2009, the Task Force shall specifically\nexamine contracting out in two areas: (a) transportation engineering; and\n(b) information technology. Its report shall\ninclude recommendations as to whether and how such contracting may be limited, including regulatory, legislative and/or budgetary proposals. 7. The reports shall indicate the\nprogress the State has made towards the goal of limiting the number of QPSCs to\nthose that comply with the criteria set forth in Section C of this\norder. 8. The report shall be\navailable for public inspection and copying, provided that the Task Force shall\nredact the name and social security number of any employee that is included in\nsuch document, any other confidential personnel information, and any reference\nto any confidential information redacted pursuant to Section D(4) or pursuant\nto the Freedom of Information Law. E. Miscellaneous Provisions\n1.

Unless otherwise stated, this\norder shall cover only contracts for personal services entered into 60 days\nafter the date of this order, and for which a request for proposal or other\nsolicitation was not issued prior to the effective date of this order. For\npurposes of this order, a contract is \"entered into\" on such date that it has\nbeen signed by all parties, and has received any approvals required before the\ncontract can go into effect.
