  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2040.9 - Compliance and inspection\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For all\nbuildings placed in service on or after January 1, 2001, the division shall\nconduct on-site inspections of all buildings in the project by the end of the\nsecond calendar year following the year the last building in the project is\nplaced in service and, for at least 20 percent of the projects's low-income\nunits, inspect the units for habitability and review the low-income\ncertifications, the documentation supporting the certifications, and the rent\nrecords for the tenants in those units. (b) At least once every three years, the\nagency shall conduct on-site inspections of all buildings in the project and, for at least 20 percent of the project's low-income units, inspect the units\nfor habitability and review the low-income certifications, the documentation\nsupporting the certifications, and the rent records for the tenants in those\nunits. (c) The agency shall\nrandomly select which low-income units and tenant records are to be inspected\nand reviewed by the agency. The review of tenant records may be undertaken\nwherever the owner maintains or stores the records (either on-site or\noff-site). The units and tenant records to be inspected and reviewed shall be\nchosen in a manner that will not give owners of low-income housing projects\nadvance notice that a unit and tenant records for a particular year will or\nwill not be inspected and reviewed. DHCR may give an owner reasonable notice\nthat an inspection of the building and low-income units or tenant record review\nwill occur so that the owner may notify tenants of the inspection or assemble\ntenant records for review. (d) The\ndivision shall review any local health, safety, or building code violations, reports or notices retained by the owner and must determine whether the\nbuildings and units satisfy, as determined by the agency, the uniform physical\ncondition standards for public housing established by HUD (24 CFR\n5.703\n). The HUD physical condition standards\ndo not supersede or preempt local health, safety, and building codes. A\nlow-income housing project under section 42 must continue to satisfy these\ncodes and, if the agency becomes aware of any violation of these codes, the\nagency must report the violation to the IRS. However, provided the agency\ndetermines by inspection that the HUD standards are met, the agency is not\nrequired to determine by inspection whether the project meets local health, safety, and building codes. (e) Exception from inspection provision. The division shall not be required to inspect a building\nunder subdivision (d) of this section if the building is financed by the Rural\n\nHousing Service (RHS) under the section 515 program, the RHS inspects the\nbuilding (under 7 CFR part\n1930\n), and the RHS and DHCR enter into a memorandum\nof understanding, or other similar arrangement, under which the RHS agrees to\nnotify the agency of the inspection results. (f) An inspection may include, but is not\nlimited to: a physical inspection of the building, grounds, individual rental\nunits, common facilities and central systems for general construction; a review\nof all records described above; interviews of tenants and project employees; and any other information which the division deems relevant.
