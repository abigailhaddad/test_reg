(1)\n\nPlacement referrals shall be made by the\noffice or community mental health providers. (2)\n\nIt is the responsibility of program\nsponsor to screen the placement of prospective residents with family care\nproviders in family care homes. (3)\n\nRestrictions on placements. (i) No individual\nagainst whom a warrant has been filed by a criminal court or district attorney\nin connection with a criminal proceeding may be placed with a family care\nprovider in a family care home. (ii)\n\nPersons committed to the custody of the\n\nOffice of Mental Health pursuant to an order of a criminal court or a civil\ncourt pursuant to article 10 of the Mental Hygiene Law, cannot be placed with a\nfamily care provider in a family care home unless prior permission has been\nobtained from the court with jurisdiction over the case which authorizes such\nplacement. (4)\nA family\ncare provider may accept a placement from an entity other than the office or\ncommunity mental health provider, (such as a housing authority or social\nservice agency) but only after such placement has received the prior approval\nof the program sponsor pursuant to a written agreement between the program\nsponsor and the director of the other placing entity. Such placements shall be\ncounted as part of the certified capacity of the family care home. (5)\n\nEach program sponsor shall use its best\nefforts to have a variety of placements in family care available to meet the\nneeds of the residents. (6)\n\nWhenever feasible and appropriate to the needs of the prospective resident, placements in family care should be transitional and time limited to ensure\nresidents are moved to the least restrictive, most independent living\narrangements that are possible, provided, however, that nothing in this section\nshall be deemed to prevent an extended or long term placement, if that is\nappropriate to the needs of a particular resident. (7)\n\nEach prospective resident shall have a\ncurrent medical examination prior to placement in a family care home For\npurposes of this paragraph, current shall mean no more than six months prior to\nplacement. (b) Admission.

(3)\n\nWithin 30 days of placement in a family\ncare home, each resident shall have a residential service plan prepared by the\nprogram sponsor. (i) The residential service\nplan shall be based on treatment plan recommendations and shall outline the\nresidential service needs of the resident and identify family care provider and\nstaff roles with respect to the resident. It shall include: (a) long and short term goals based on the\nresident's needs and abilities; (b) services and program that will be available to meet goals; and\n(c) strategies and timetables for attaining\ngoals. (ii)\n\nThe results\nof the medical examination conducted pursuant to paragraph (a)(7) of this\nsection shall be used, as appropriate, to supplement the residential service\nplan. (iii)\n\nThe preparation of the\nresidential service plan shall involve the resident (or, if the resident is not\ncompetent, someone acting on behalf of the resident), the family care provider, and other providers of services as appropriate. (iv)\n\nThe residential service plan shall be\nreviewed at least quarterly during the first year of placement and\nsemi-annually thereafter. (c) Discharge. (1)\n\nThe family care provider shall\nparticipate in the formulation of a discharge plan for every resident. Discharge planning shall be part of residential service plan reviews and shall\nbe incorporated within such plan as appropriate. (2)\n\nDischarge criteria.

(3)\n\nNo overt\nor covert psychological or physical pressure shall be applied to prevent a\nresident who desires to leave a family care home from doing so. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
