  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-11.5 - Controlled demolition with asbestos in place\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Air sampling and analysis. Air sampling\nand analysis on an asbestos project conducted under this section shall be\nconducted in accordance with the requirements of Subpart 56-4 of this Part. (1)\n\nIn addition to the requirement of section\n56-4.9\n(b)-(c)\nof\nthis Part, air monitoring within the work areas shall be conducted daily during\nabatement and cleaning activities. If more than one shift daily is required to\naccomplish the work, air monitoring within the work area during abatement shall\nbe performed on each shift, preferably at mid-shift timing. (b) Asbestos to remain during\ndemolition. A building/structure may be demolished with asbestos material in\nplace as per the requirements of this Section, when the following condition is\nmet: (1)\n\nBuilding/structure is condemned. A\nbuilding or structure may be ruled structurally unsafe by a licensed\nprofessional engineer, registered architect, building inspector, fire inspector\nor other official of competent jurisdiction. The official shall attest to the\ncondition of the building/structure in writing. A copy of the condemnation\nletter shall be attached to the project notification mailed to the Department\nof Labor and a copy shall be posted at the work site. (c) Controlled demolition procedures. The\nfollowing controlled demolition procedures shall be followed: (1)\n\nProject size. Unless the size of the\nproject can be positively quantified it shall be deemed to be a large project. The maximum fee shall accompany the notification. (2)\n\nRegulated abatement work area. The entire\ndemolition area shall be considered the regulated abatement work area. This\narea shall be enclosed within a barrier to prevent unauthorized entry. Signage\non this barrier shall be in accordance with section\n56-7.4\nof this Part. Orange\nconstruction fence or snow fence is acceptable for this purpose. For outdoor\nregulated abatement work areas, all adjacent building openings within 25 feet\nof the outermost limit of the disturbance shall be sealed with two layers of\nsix mil fire-retardant plastic sheeting, and the exterior asbestos project\nregulated abatement work area shall extend a minimum of 25 feet from the\noutermost limit of the disturbance. (3)\n\nEntrance or exit. Entrance or exit of all\npersons and equipment shall be through one designated and controlled \"access\nway\" in the barrier or fence, which shall provide a means of egress from the\nregulated abatement work area. (4)\n\nDecontamination areas. All decontamination areas shall be within the regulated\nabatement work area. An equipment decontamination area shall be cordoned off\nwithin the worksite for cleaning of heavy equipment, i.e., backhoes, excavators, loaders, etc. The ground surface in this decontamination area shall\nbe banked on the sides to confine the contaminated wastewater. (5)\n\nEquipment decontamination. Equipment\nshall be decontaminated prior to exiting the regulated abatement work area, utilizing a pressure wash system, after which all exposed surfaces inside and\nout shall be wet wiped. The surface below the equipment shall be scraped or\ncleaned of any residual asbestos contamination. This material shall be removed\nand disposed of as asbestos contaminated material. (6)\n\nWet methods. No dry disturbance or\nremoval of ACM, PACM or asbestos material shall be permitted. (7)\n\nDebris. All debris generated by the\ndemolition shall be considered to be asbestos contaminated waste (to be\ndisposed of as RACM), except for structural members, steel components and\nsimilar non-suspect items which shall be fully decontaminated as per this\n\nPart. (8)\n\nWetted demolition waste. The demolition waste shall be wetted on a continuous basis that is prior to, during and subsequent to its actual collection and removal. Fog nozzles or\nsimilar type of equipment shall be used to perform the wetting. (9)\n\nWetted piles of waste. Piles of waste not\nactively being worked on, i.e., piles being added to or portions being removed\nor piles left over extended periods of time, shall be covered with at least one\nlayer of six mil polyethylene to retain its moisture level and to prevent fiber\nrelease. (10)\n\nWastewater. Wastewater shall be confined within the controlled demolition regulated\nabatement work area. All wastewater shall be collected by means of trenching or\nditches and directed into a holding tank. Disposal of such wastewater shall be\nin accordance with applicable laws and regulations. After wastewater has\ndissipated, the earth surface below the trenches and holding tank shall be\nscraped and any residual asbestos contamination removed and disposed of as\nasbestos contaminated waste. (11)\n\nPending disposal. All demolition waste shall be placed in hard wall, closed\ncontainers or vehicles with at least two layers of fire-retardant six mil\nplastic sheeting draped loosely over the sides of the load to facilitate being\nwrapped over the top of the load and sealed air tight prior to transport from\nthe site. Dumpsters shall be considered to be hard wall containers. There shall\nbe no visible emissions or water leakage from these containers. (12)\n\nContaminated earth surfaces. The earth\nsurface below the rubble and or contamination areas shall be scraped clean of\nany residual asbestos contamination. This material shall be removed and\ndisposed of as asbestos contaminated waste. (13)\n\nFinal cleaning and clearance procedures. Final clean-up and clearance procedures for abatement shall comply with Subpart\n56-9 of this Part, except that only one stage of cleaning (final) is to be\nperformed. Lockdown encapsulant use is not required. (14)\n\nFinal waste removal from the site. The\nrequirements of Subpart 56-10 of this Part shall apply, once all asbestos\nproject regulated abatement work areas have been satisfactorily\ncleared. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-11.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
