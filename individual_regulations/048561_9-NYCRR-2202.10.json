  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2202.10 - Unavoidable increases in operating costs in other specified structures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A landlord may\nfile an application for an increase in maximum rents on the ground that he\noperates a hotel or rooming house, or owns a cooperative apartment, and has\nincurred unavoidable increases in property taxes and other costs, including\ncosts of operation of such hotel or rooming house, but excluding mortgage\ninterest and amortization and excluding allowances for obsolescence and\nreserves and building depreciation, which have occurred since the Federal date\ndetermining the maximum rent or the date the landlord commenced the operation\nof the property, whichever is later. If, as determined by the administrator, the landlord has not been fully compensated by increases in rental income from\nthe controlled housing accommodations sufficient to offset such increases in\noperating costs as are allowable to such controlled housing accommodations, the\nadministrator shall grant an adjustment of the maximum rents. (b) Where the administrator finds, in\nconsidering an application under this section, that a present tenant is paying\na rent less than the maximum rent, the administrator, upon request of the\nlandlord, may reduce the maximum rent of the housing accommodation to the\namount actually being paid, or to the highest maximum rent for comparable\ncontrolled housing accommodations in the structure, whichever is\nhigher. (c) A further application\nmay not be filed under this section sooner than one year from the date of\nfiling of the last prior application for an increase with respect to such\nproperty under this section, or under the provisions of section\n4\n(4)(a)(3)\nof the State Rent Act, where such\nprior application resulted in the granting of an increase.
