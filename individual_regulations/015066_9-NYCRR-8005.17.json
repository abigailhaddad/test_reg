  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8005.17 - Scheduling of the Final Revocation Hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The final\nrevocation hearing shall be scheduled to take place according to the rules\nprovided in this section, and other sections of this Part and Part 8004 of this\n\nTitle as may be relevant to reasonably ensure substantial compliance with the\n\nExecutive Law. Generally: (1)\n\nWhere a notice\nof violation has been issued but no parole warrant was issued, the final\nhearing shall be scheduled to occur within 45 days of issuance of the notice. Issuance of the notice of violation within the meaning of this paragraph occurs\nwhen the releasee has been served with such notice and: (i) has appeared as directed in response to a\nnotice of violation; or\n(ii)\nhas\nappeared in response to a notice of violation within forty-eight hours of the\ndirected time, but otherwise as directed. In a case that has been properly\nidentified as a technical violation case in which no period of reincarceration\nmay be imposed, if the releasee did not appear as described in paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (d) of section\n8004.6\nof this Title, no final\nhearing is to be scheduled. (2)\n\nWhere a parole warrant was issued and the\nreleasee ordered released by a court at the conclusion of a recognizance\nhearing pursuant to the Executive Law, the final hearing shall be scheduled to\noccur within 45 days of issuance of the court's release order. Should release\non recognizance be ordered but a court thereafter again consider the releasee's\ndetention, the final hearing may be scheduled or rescheduled to occur within 45\ndays of the court's conclusion upon such new consideration if the court again\norders release, or if the court now orders detention, within the later of 30\ndays of either the issuance of the court's order directing that the releasee be\ndetained, or issuance of the determination following a preliminary hearing that\nthere exists a preponderance of evidence that the releasee violated one or more\nconditions of release in an important respect or the waiver of the preliminary\nhearing. Nothing within this paragraph shall be interpreted to require a\nrescheduling of the final hearing, or to require the scheduling of a new final\nhearing where a final hearing had commenced. (3)\n\nWhere a parole warrant was issued and the\nreleasee was ordered detained by a court at the conclusion of a recognizance\nhearing pursuant to the Executive Law and where no such hearing relative to\nsame revocation case had previously occurred, the final hearing shall be\nscheduled to occur within 30 days of either issuance of the determination\nfollowing a preliminary hearing that there exists a preponderance of evidence\nthat the releasee violated one or more conditions of release in an important\nrespect, or the waiver of the preliminary hearing. (4)\n\nThere shall be good cause to extend the\ntime in which the final hearing is scheduled to occur where reasonably\nnecessary to allow for its conduct at the appropriate location and facility as\nset forth in subdivision (b) of this section. (5)\n\nThe scheduling or conduct of a final\nhearing for a releasee who has absconded from supervision and remains in such\nstatus or who is otherwise not within the convenience and practical control of\nthe Department is not required during such period. (b) Location of the hearing. (1)\n\nThe final hearing shall be scheduled and\nheld in a courthouse, in cooperation with the chief administrator of the courts\nand the chief administrator's designees, provided, however, that if such a\ncourthouse is not reasonably available for such hearing, the Department may\ndesignate a suitable office or other similar facility that is not a\ncorrectional facility, detention center or local correctional facility for such\nhearing. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, in the department's discretion and as\nappropriate, where the releasee is in custody or residence within a medical, correctional or similar facility, and will not be produced for a revocation\nproceeding at another location or courthouse, the final hearing may be\nscheduled and held in a location deemed necessary under the circumstances for\npurposes of the timely processing of the case. Subsequent changes in a\nreleasee's custodial or residential status shall permit the department\nreasonable extension of time for scheduling or rescheduling at another\nappropriate location. (c) The alleged violator and an attorney who has filed a notice of appearance in\naccordance with rules of the Board shall be given written notice of the date, place and time of the hearing in accordance with section\n8005.18\nof this Part. (d) Adjournments. (1)\n\nWhere an adjournment is granted at the\nrequest of or agreed to by an alleged violator or their counsel, or where an\nalleged violator or their attorney, by their actions, preclude the prompt\nconduct of a final revocation hearing, the time in which to hold the hearing\nshall be extended to the next available date. (2)\nA request for an adjournment may be\ngranted, or the presiding officer on their own motion may direct an\nadjournment, upon good cause shown, having due regard for the interests of the\nparties and the obligations of the Board to hear the case. (3)\nA request for a continuance of a final\nrevocation hearing already commenced and in progress may be granted in the\ndiscretion of the presiding officer, having due regard for the interests of the\nparties. Such requests shall be for good cause and must be noted on the hearing\nrecord. (4)\n\nNothing in this section\nshall preclude a presiding officer from adjourning a case with chargeable time\nallocated between parties. Adjournments and continuances may be further\nmanaged, not inconsistent with the rights of the parties, pursuant to guidance\nor policy of the Board. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
