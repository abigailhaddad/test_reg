  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5316.11 - Contents of critical memory\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Critical memory. Critical memory is used to store all data that is considered\nvital to the continued operation of the kiosk, including, without limitation: (1)\nall electronic meters required in section\n5316.17\nof this Part; including\nlast-bill data and door-open metering; (2)\nvoucher-redeemed log, provided such log\nis not stored on printed paper within the device; and\n(3)\nsoftware state (the last normal state, last status or tilt status the kiosk software was in before\ninterruption). (b) Function of NV memory reset. Following the initiation of a NV-memory-reset\nprocedure (using a certified NV-memory-clear method) the kiosk software shall\nexecute a routine that initializes all bits in critical NV memory to the\ndefault state. All memory locations intended to be cleared as per the\nNV-memory-clear process shall be reset fully in all cases. For kiosks that\nallow for partial NV-memory clears, the methodology in doing so shall be\naccurate. (c) Maintenance of\ncritical memory. Critical memory storage shall be maintained by a methodology\nthat enables errors to be identified. Such methodology may involve signatures, checksums, partial checksums, multiple copies, timestamps and/or effective use\nof validity codes. This subdivision is not intended to preclude the use of\nalternate storage media types, such as hard disk drives, for the retention of\ncritical data. Such alternate storage media shall maintain critical data\nintegrity in a manner consistent with the requirements in this section, as\napplicable to the specific storage technology implemented. (d) Data alteration. A kiosk shall not permit\nthe alteration of any meter or error-condition log information without\nsupervised access controls. In the event meter or error-condition log data is\nchanged, an audit log shall be capable of being produced to document: (1)\ndata element altered; (2)\ndata element value prior to\nalteration; (3)\ndata element value\nafter alteration; (4)\ntime and date\nof alteration; and\n(5)\npersonnel\nthat performed alteration (user login). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5316.11\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 16, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 46, eff. 11/16/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
