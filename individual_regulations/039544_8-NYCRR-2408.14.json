  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 2408.14 - Matriculated status\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A student\nshall be considered in matriculated status if: (1)\nthe student has filed a written\napplication for enrollment at the educational institution for the purpose of\nearning a degree in an approved program; (2)\nin accepting the student's application, the educational institution has taken into account the capacity of the student\nto undertake a course of study and its own capacity to provide what\ninstructional and other support the student needs to complete the program; and\n(3)\nthe educational\ninstitution, on the basis of that demonstration has recognized the student as a\ncandidate for a degree. It shall not be necessary that the student, in\naddition, have passed matriculation examinations or language examinations, or\ncompleted any other particular prerequisites established by the school in\naccordance with local custom or regulation. (b) The student who is enrolled for courses\nsolely to complete teacher certification, licensing or other external\nrequirements, or solely for personal or cultural advancement, and who is not\nrecognized as a candidate for a degree, shall not be considered a matriculated\nstudent. (c) A student shall be\nconsidered matriculated only if the courses pursued by the student are fully\nrecognized at that time as contributing towards fulfillment by the student of\nthe requirements for completion of the program. A student required to complete\ncertain courses to make up deficiencies in background or training may be\nconsidered matriculated if acceptance and credit are not conditioned upon\nadditional and special requirements designed to establish the qualifications of\nthe student to pursue the program successfully. However, if credit is\nconditional, depending upon satisfactory completion of certain special and\nadditional requirements, then the student shall not be considered to be fully\nmatriculated. (d) Retroactive\nmatriculation by the educational institution shall not establish retroactive\neligibility for student aid unless such retroactive action was necessary to\ncorrect clerical error or administrative delay in reviewing the application of\na student who was in fact eligible for matriculation as of the retroactive\ndate. (e) Students enrolled under\npermit from other schools where they are matriculated may be certified as\nmatriculated by the educational institution attended. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
