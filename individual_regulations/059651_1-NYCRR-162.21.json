New York State Seal of Quality mushrooms shall be fresh mushrooms of\nsimilar varietal characteristics which are mature, fairly well shaped, provided\n50 percent of the lot is well shaped, well trimmed, free from open veils, disease, spots, insect injury and decay, and from damage by any\ncause. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nSimilar varietal characteristics means\nthat the mushrooms are of the same general color. For example, white and brown\nmushrooms shall not be mixed in the same container. (2)\n\nMature means that the mushroom is firm\nand well developed; the veil area may be stretched but not broken. (3)\n\nWell shaped means that the mushroom cap\nis not flattened, scalloped, indented or otherwise deformed to an extent which\nslightly detracts from the appearance or marketing quality. (4)\n\nFairly well shaped means that the\nmushroom cap is not flattened, scalloped, indented or otherwise deformed to an\nextent which materially detracts from the appearance or marketing\nquality. (5)\n\nWell trimmed means\nthat the stems are smoothly cut, free from rough fleshy butts, the flared\nportion of the butt is removed and the remaining portion of the stem does not\nexceed the depth of the cap. (6)\n\nOpen veils means that the cap has expanded to the extent that the protective\ncovering or veils joining the margin of the cap to the stem have broken and\nexposed the gills or underside of the cap. (7)\n\nSpots means pitted or discolored\nareas. (8)\n\nDamage means any\nspecific defect described in this section; or an equally objectionable\nvariation of any one of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of\ndefects which materially detracts from the appearance or the edible or\nmarketing quality of the individual mushroom or of the mushrooms in the lot. The following specific defects shall be considered as damage: (i) Discoloration when the color of the cap\nor stem materially affects the appearance or marketing quality of the\nmushrooms. (ii)\n\nDirt when any\namount is embedded in the cap or stem. (9)\n\nLength of stem means the greatest\ndistance as measured from the point of attachment of the veils on the stem to\nthe butt. (10)\n\nDiameter means the\ngreatest dimension of the cap measured at right angles to the stem. (c) Size. Size is specified in\nterms of diameter and unless otherwise specified meets the requirements of one\nof the following size classifications: (1)\n\nSmall to medium--up to 1 5/8 inches in diameter. (2)\n\nLarge--over 1 5/8 inches in\ndiameter. (d) Tolerance. In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling the\nfollowing tolerances, by weight, are provided as specified: (1)\n\nFor defects. Five percent for mushrooms\nin any lot which fail to meet the requirements of these specifications, but not\nmore than one-fifth of this amount or one percent shall be allowed for\nmushrooms affected by disease, spots or decay. (2)\n\nFor off-size. Ten percent for mushrooms\nin any lot which fail to meet the specified size requirements. (e) Application of tolerances. The\ncontents of individual packages in the lot, based on sample inspection are\nsubject to the following limitations: (1)\n\nFor\na tolerance of 10 percent or more, individual packages in any lot shall have\nnot more than one and one-half times the tolerance specified: provided, that\nthe average for the entire lot is within the tolerance specified. (2)\n\nFor a tolerance of less than 10 percent, individual packages in any lot shall have not more than double the tolerance\nspecified, except that at least one defective and one off-size specimen may be\npermitted in any package: provided, that the average for the entire lot is\nwithin the tolerance specified. (f) Packing. Mushrooms must be packed in new\nstandard containers subject to approval by the Department of Agriculture and\n\nMarkets. Container approval shall be based upon the ability of the container to\nmaintain the quality standards and integrity of the product. (g) Markings. Each container or display of\nmushrooms offered for sale under the Seal of Quality program shall have the\nofficial seal designation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
