Tit. 20 §§ 9-1.2 - Definition of qualified New York manufacturer\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210(1)(a)(vi) and 210(1)(b)(2))\n(a) A corporation or, in the case of a\ncombined report, a combined group, engaged in the production of goods by\nmanufacturing, processing, assembling, refining, mining, extracting, farming, agriculture, horticulture, floriculture, viticulture, or commercial fishing\nduring the taxable year will be a qualified New York manufacturer if the\ncriteria in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision are met. (1)\n(i) The\ncorporation or combined group derives more than 50% of its gross receipts\nduring the taxable year from its sale of goods produced by manufacturing, processing, assembling, refining, mining, extracting, farming, agriculture, horticulture, floriculture, viticulture, or commercial fishing (hereinafter\nreferred to as the \"principally engaged test\") and has qualified manufacturing\nproperty that has a New York adjusted basis of at least one million dollars at\nthe end of the taxable year or has all its real and personal property in New\n\nYork State for the entire taxable year. (ii)\n\nThe corporation's sale of goods requires\nthat title be transferred from the taxpayer to another party, except in\ninstances of contracts covering more than one taxable year for the ultimate\nsale of goods. Any receipts earned pursuant to such contracts in each taxable\nyear shall be deemed a sale of goods even though transfer of title has not yet\noccurred. The sale of a good shall not include: (a) the licensing of goods; (b) the sale of a warranty; (c) the sale of an insurance contract; or\n(d) the sale of advertising\nrelated to the good. (iii)\n\nTo determine whether the corporation or\nthe combined group has satisfied the principally engaged test, the total\neverywhere receipts as determined under this Subchapter of the corporation or, in the case of a combined report, the combined group, shall be multiplied by a\nfraction. The denominator of the fraction used to compute the principally\nengaged test is the corporation's or combined group's everywhere receipts, except that any global intangible low-taxed income as defined in IRC section\n951A must be excluded. The numerator of the fraction is the portion of such\neverywhere receipts derived from the sale, by the taxpayer or combined group, of goods produced by manufacturing, processing, assembling, refining, mining, extracting, farming, agriculture, horticulture, floriculture, viticulture, or\ncommercial fishing. Receipts from the foregoing activities are combined when\ndetermining the numerator of the fraction for the principally engaged\ntest. (iv)\n\nIn the case of a\ncombined report, intercorporate receipts are eliminated in the computation of\nthe principally engaged test. (2)\nA corporation or a combined group, in the\ncase of a combined report, that does not satisfy the principally engaged test\nwill be a qualified New York manufacturer if the corporation or combined group\nemploys at least 2,500 qualified manufacturing employees on the last day of the\ntaxable year and has qualified manufacturing property that has an adjusted\nbasis of at least 100 million dollars at the close of the taxable\nyear. (b) In determining\nwhether goods are produced by manufacturing, processing, assembling, refining, mining, extracting, farming, agriculture, horticulture, floriculture, viticulture, or commercial fishing (hereinafter referred to as manufacturing\nactivities), the following will not be considered manufacturing activities: (1)\nA process that makes a good more\nattractive for sale without substantially altering the good. (2)\nA process that does not effect a material\nchange in the good. (3)\n\nMarket\nresearch, research and development, and design and creation of a\nprototype. (4)\n\nThe manipulation of\ninformation. (5)\n\nThe transmission\nof information. (6)\n\nThe performance\nof a service. (7)\n\nCooking, baking\nand other preparation of food for on-site consumption. (8)\n\nThe generation and distribution of\nelectricity, the distribution of natural gas, and the production of steam, ice, or any other good associated with the generation of electricity. (9)\n\nThe creation of a digital\nproduct. (10)\n\nHeating, cooling, regulating, cleaning, purifying, blending, and distributing\nactivities. (c) The\ndetermination of whether a corporation or a combined group is a qualified New\n\nYork manufacturer is done on an annual basis. (d) For purposes of computing the capital\nbase tax, a qualified New York manufacturer includes a corporation that is\ndefined as a qualified emerging technology company under Public Authorities Law\nsection 3102-e(1)(c) regardless of the $10 million limitations expressed in\nsubparagraph (1) of that paragraph (c). In the case of a combined report, all\nmembers of the combined group must be qualified emerging technology companies\nfor the combined group to be considered a qualified New York manufacturer under\nthis subdivision.
