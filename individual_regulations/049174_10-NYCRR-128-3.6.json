(1)\n\nUnless otherwise permitted by these rules and regulations, the design, construction, or operation of a wastewater treatment plant is prohibited where such design, construction, or operation causes a discharge, or storage which is reasonably likely to lead to a discharge, of sewage or sewage effluent into the environment (including into groundwater), and which is reasonably likely to cause degradation of surface water quality or of the water supply. It shall be an affirmative defense under this subsection that such discharge, or storage likely to lead to a discharge, is either permitted or not prohibited under Federal law, and is either permitted or not prohibited under State law. (2)\n\nThe design of new wastewater treatment plants, and the plans and specifications resulting from that design, require the review and approval of the department. The construction of new wastewater treatment plants shall be in conformance with the plans and specifications approved by the department. (3)\n\nThe design for an expansion or an alteration or modification of new or existing wastewater treatment plants, and the plans and specifications resulting from that design, require the review and approval of the department. The construction of the expansion or alteration or modification shall be in accordance with the plans and specifications approved by the department. (4)\n\nThe owner or operator of a new or existing wastewater treatment plant shall operate and maintain the wastewater treatment plant in accordance with the operations and maintenance manual for the plant. Such manual shall be prepared by the owner and approved by the department. (5)\n\nNo new wastewater treatment plants with a surface discharge, or expansion or alteration or modification of new or existing wastewater treatment plants, shall cause a contravention of the water quality standards set forth in Subpart 128-4 of this Part or the phosphorus water quality values set forth in the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Technical and Operational Guidance Series (TOGS) 1.1.1, Ambient Water Quality Standards and Guidance Values (October 22, 1993). (6)\n\nNo part of any seepage unit or absorption field for a subsurface discharge from a wastewater treatment plant shall be located within the limiting distance of 100 feet of a watercourse or wetland or within the limiting distance of 500 feet of a reservoir, reservoir stem, or controlled lake. (7)\n\nWastewater treatment plants with surface discharges into the watershed shall be capable of achieving 99.9 percent removal and/or inactivation of Giardia lamblia cysts and 99.99 percent removal and/or inactivation of enteric viruses. (8)\n\nWastewater treatment plants with either surface or subsurface discharges within the watershed shall provide phosphorus removal using the best treatment technology so that the wastewater treatment plant is designed to be operated and maintained to meet the following requirements: SPDES Permitted\n\nTotal\n\nTotal Flow\n\nPhosphorus Limit\n(gallons/day)\n(mg/l)\n<= 50,000\n1.0\n>50,000 and <500,000\n0.5\n>= 500,000\n0.2\n(9)\n\nWastewater treatment plants with surface discharges to intermittent streams in the watershed shall be operated and maintained to meet the intermittent stream effluent limits set forth in the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Technical and Operational Guidance Series (TOGS) 1.3.1, Total Maximum Daily Loads and Water Quality-Based Effluent Limits (July 8, 1996) and New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Technical and Operational Guidance Series (TOGS) 1.3.1B, Total Maximum Daily Loads and Water Quality-Based Effluent Limits, Amendments-Low and Intermittent Stream Standards (July 8, 1996), provided however, that the effluent limit for a discharge of a pollutant to an intermittent stream shall in no case be less stringent than the effluent limit which would apply to the same discharge of the pollutant to the first downstream perennial stream. (10)\n\nWithin one year of the effective date of these rules and regulations, the owners of all existing wastewater treatment plants shall submit to the department for review and approval an operations and maintenance plan and a schedule setting forth a plan for bringing the wastewater treatment plant into compliance with all of the requirements of this section. Any such plan that is disapproved by the department shall be revised and resubmitted to the department for review and approval within 90 days after the initial disapproval. Owners of existing wastewater treatment plants must secure final department approval of such operation and maintenance plans and such a schedule setting forth a plan for bringing the plant into compliance by no later than 18 months from the effective date of these rules and regulations, and must complete all work in order for such plants to be brought into compliance with the requirements of this section by no later than five years from the effective date of these rules and regulations or any extended period of time approved by the department upon good cause shown. (11)\n\nExisting wastewater treatment plants with surface discharges are prohibited from expanding if they are located in an area where new wastewater treatment plants with surface discharges are prohibited by these rules and regulations. This paragraph shall not apply to existing wastewater treatment plants which discharge subsurface or the expansion of existing wastewater treatment plants where the expanded portion discharges subsurface.
