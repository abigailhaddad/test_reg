  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4620.3 - Craps (Dice)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Equipment. (1)\nA table with an upright rail running\naround the table's outside edges, forming a rectangular enclosure. The rail\nserves as a backboard and also helps to prevent the rolling dice from falling\noff the table. (2)\n\nTwo dice. The\ndealer has at least five dice in front of the dealer, from which the shooter\nselects two dice to roll. (b) Players. (1)\n\nAny number can play, provided there is\nroom at the table. (2)\n\nThe player\nthrowing the dice is the shooter. (c) The play. (1)\n\nThe dice are thrown and the two numbers, added together, that face upward when the dice come to rest are the deciding\nnumbers. (2)\n\nThe shooter's first\nroll is a come-out. (3)\n\nIf, on the\ncome-out, the shooter throws a natural (7 or 11), it is a winning decision\ncalled a pass. If on the come-out the shooter throws a crap (2, 3 or 12), it is\na losing decision called a miss-out. If the shooter throws a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, that number becomes the shooter's point and the shooter continues throwing\nuntil either: (i) he throws his point again, which is a winning decision or pass; or\n(ii)\nhe throws a 7, which is a losing\ndecision or a miss-out. (4)\n\nWhen the shooter misses out on the point, the dice pass to the next player on the shooter's left and it becomes such\nplayer's turn to shoot. (5)\n\nThe\nshooter may, if the shooter likes, pass the dice to the next player on\ncompletion of a decision without waiting to miss out on the point. (6)\n\nAny player may, if the player likes, refuse to shoot in the player's turn, and pass the dice to the next\nplayer. (7)\n\nWhen more than one pair\nof dice are employed, players may call for a change of dice at any time. The\nchange takes place immediately after the next decision. (d) Betting. (1)\n\nAll bets must be made before the dice are\nthrown. (2)\n\nRight bet: a wager that\nthe dice will pass (win) either by making a natural on the come-out or by\nthrowing a point number on the come-out and then repeating it before throwing a\n7. Players making right bets are right bettors. (3)\n\nWrong bet: a wager that the dice will not\npass (lose). Players making wrong bets are wrong bettors. (e) Placing bets on layout. (1)\n\nPass line. The bettor is betting with the\ndice and the payoff is even money. The bettor wins on a \"natural\" 7 or 11 on\nthe first roll, lose and loses on \"craps\" 2, 3 or 12 on the first roll. Any\nother number on the first roll is the shooter's point. The bettor wins if the\n\"point\" is thrown again, unless a 7 is thrown first, in which case the bettor\nloses. The maximum bet shall be $5 or its equivalent in chips. (2)\n\nDon't pass line. Same as in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision, except that the bettor is betting against the dice and\neverything is reversed. The bettor loses on a \"natural\" 7 or 11 on the first\nroll and the bettor wins on a \"craps\" 2 or 12. When ace-deuce (1-2) is rolled, it is a standoff (push) and nobody wins. The bettor wins if the shooter rolls 7\nbefore making the shooter's \"point.\" The maximum bet shall be $5 or its\nequivalent in chips. (3)\n\nThe odds. (i) Taking the odds. Once a shooter's point\nhas been established, players with pass line bets may take odds in amounts\nequal to their original wagers that the shooter will make the shooter's point\nbefore a losing roll of 7: Shooter's point Maximum bet To win Payoff odds 4 or 10\n$5 $10 2-1 5 or 9 6 9 3-2 6 or 8 5 6 6-5\n(ii)\n\nLaying the odds. Once a shooter's point\nhas been established, players with don't pass bets may lay the odds against the\nshooter and win if a 7 is rolled before the shooter's point: Shooter's point Maximum lay odds To win Payoff odds 4 or\n10 $6 $3 1-2 5 or 9 6 4 2-3 6 or 8 6 5 5-6\n(4)\n\nPlace bets. Players may place bets on the\nnumbers 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 (except on an established point number) before any\nroll of the dice. Each place bet wins when its corresponding number is rolled\nbefore a losing roll of 7. Place bets may be called off by the bettor prior to\nany roll: Place number Maximum bet To win Payoff odds 4 or 10 $5\n$9 9-5 5 or 9 5 7 7-5 6 or 8 6 7 7-6\n(5)\n\nCome bets and don't come bets. (i) On layouts with approximate betting\nspaces, players may make additional wagers after a shooter's point has been\nestablished. For come bets and don't come bets only, the next roll of the dice\nwill be considered the first (come-out) roll: Come bets win on a roll of 7 or\n11 and lose on a roll of 2, 3, or 12. If any other number is rolled by the\nshooter, this bet is removed from the Come box by the dealer and moved into the\nnumbered box corresponding with the shooter's previous roll, where it will\nremain until it wins when this designated point is rolled again or loses on a\nroll of 7. Come bets may not be removed by the player once they have been moved\ninto a point box. The maximum wager shall be $5 or its equivalent in chips and\nthe payoff is at even money (1-1). (ii)\n\nDon't come bets win on a roll of 2 or\n12, push on a 3 and lose on a 7 or 11. If any other number is rolled by the\nshooter, the bet is removed from the don't come box by the dealer and moved\ninto a designated space behind the numbered box corresponding with the\nshooter's previous roll, where it will remain until it wins on a roll of 7 or\nloses if the designated point is rolled again. Don't come bets may not be\nremoved once they have been moved behind a numbered box. The maximum wager is\n$5 or its equivalent in chips and the payoff is at even money (1-1). (iii)\n\nTaking the odds on come bets. Once a\nplayer's come bet has been moved into a point box by the dealer, the player may\nwager an amount equal to the player's original come bet that this point will\nroll before a losing roll of 7: Come point Maximum odds To win Payoff odds 4 or 10 $5\n$10 2-1 5 or 9 6 9 3-2 6 or 8 5 6 6-5\n\nThe odd bet taken on the come bet may be removed prior to\nany roll, but the original come bet, may not. (iv)\n\nLaying the odds on don't come bets. Once\na player's don't come bet has been moved behind a point box by the dealer the\nplayer may lay the odds that a 7 will roll before the designated don't come\nnumber: Don't come point Maximum lay bet To win Payoff odds 4 or\n10 $6 $3 1-2 5 or 9 6 4 2-3 6 or 8 6 5 5-6\n\nThe lay odds bet on the don't come bet may be removed\nprior to any roll, but the original don't come bet, may not. (6)\n\nField. The bettor may bet on\nany one roll that one of the following numbers comes up: 2, 3, 4, 9, 10, 11 or\n12. If one of those numbers does come up, the bettor gets even money (1-1). If\n5, 6, 7 or 8 comes up, the bettor loses. If the layout so indicates, the 2 and\n12 pay 2-1 odds. The maximum bet shall be $5 or its equivalent in\nchips. (7)\n\nBig 6 or 8. The bettor\nwins even money (1-1) if 6 or 8 shows before a 7 is rolled. The maximum bet\nshall be $5 or its equivalent in chips. (8)\n\nAny 7. The bettor bets that the next roll\nis a 7, and the bettor collects 5 for 1 on a winning wager. The maximum bet\nshall be $5 or its equivalent in chips. (9)\n\nAny craps. The bettor bets that the next\nroll is 2, 3 or 12, and the bettor collects 8 for 1 on a winning wager. The\nmaximum bet shall be $5 or its equivalent in chips. (10)\n\nHard ways. The bettor wins if the exact\ncombination that is bet shows up. On 3-3 or 4-4 the bettor receives 10 for 1 on\na winning wager; on 2-2 or 5-5 the bettor gets 8 for 1 on a winning wager. The\nbettor loses if the same total number is rolled any other way except the hard\nway or if a 7 comes up. The maximum bet shall be $5 or its equivalent in\nchips. (11)\n\nOther one-roll bets. The bettor wins if the exact combination shows up on one roll: Ace-ace (1-1) Payoff 30 for 1 6-6 Payoff 30 for 1 Ace-2\n\nPayoff 15 for 1 6-5 Payoff 15 for 1\n\nThe maximum bet shall be $5 or its equivalent in\nchips.
