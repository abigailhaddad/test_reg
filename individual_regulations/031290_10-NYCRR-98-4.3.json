Comparative analysis includes the documented identification and assessment of the factors, processes, strategies, and evidentiary standards the MCO relied upon to determine the applicability and design of a nonquantitative treatment limitation and the processes and strategies the MCO used in operationalizing a nonquantitative treatment limitation to illustrate MCO compliance with MHPAEA.
