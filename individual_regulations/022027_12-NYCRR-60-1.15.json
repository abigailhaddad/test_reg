  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 60-1.15 - Return to work program\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An\nacceptable return to work program facilitates an employee's return to work as\nsoon as medically possible after a job-related injury or illness. A return to\nwork program provides fair and consistent practices for accommodating the needs\nof employees who have become ill or injured on the job or have sustained a\ntemporary or permanent partial disability covered by the Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw in order for such employees to make a timely and safe return to work. Nothing in these regulations precludes the employer from extending its return\nto work program for an illness or injury not covered by the Workers'\nCompensation Law; however, extending a return to work program to injuries or\nillnesses not covered by the Worker's Compensation Law will not entitle the\nemployer to an additional Incentive. (b) Services related to a return to work\nprogram may be provided directly by the employer, jointly between the employer\nand the union, through a union that represents the employer's employees, or\nthrough a contract with an outside provider.

(e) The final, approved return to work\nprogram plan shall be provided to the designated employee representative(s) in\neach workplace location or to the recognized representative of each collective\nbargaining unit, where applicable, and shall be made available to all employees\nupon request.
