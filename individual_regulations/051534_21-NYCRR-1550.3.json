  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1550.3 - Records access officer\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The general\nmanager of the fund designates the fund's director of administrative services, whose business address is at the State University Plaza, P.O. Box 1946, Albany, NY 12201, as records access officer. Such records access officer shall have the\nduty of coordinating the fund's response to public requests for access to\nrecords; provided, however, that the public shall not be denied access to\nrecords through officers and employees of the fund who have in the past been\nauthorized to make records or information available to the public. (b) Any person wishing to inspect and/or\nobtain a copy of any record of the fund, other than a payroll record, may make\napplication to said records access officer. Such application shall be made\neither orally or in writing; provided, however, that the records access officer\nmay require any such person to confirm his request in writing, except that no\nsuch written request shall be required for records that have been customarily\navailable from the fund without a written request therefor. (c) The written application form shall be\nprescribed by the records access officer. Blank forms may be obtained from the\nrecords access officer either personally on any workday at the fund's office, or by mail addressed to him. Completed forms may be submitted to the records\naccess officer either personally at the fund's office on any workday, or by\nmail addressed to him at such office. (d) (1)\n\nUpon receipt of an application to inspect records of the fund, on the proper\nform and at the appropriate time, the records access officer shall promptly\nsearch for the record requested. If the records access officer determines that\nthe record requested is not in his custody, he shall certify to the applicant, as the case may be: (i) that the fund is not\nthe legal custodian for such records; or\n(ii)\nthat the records of which the fund is a\nlegal custodian cannot be found after diligent search. (2)\n\nUpon locating the records requested, the\nrecords access officer shall either: (i) promptly produce the record for inspection and, in such case, the records\naccess officer shall either permit the applicant making the request to copy the\nrecords or, upon payment of the established fee, make a copy of the record for\nhim; or\n(ii)\ndeny access to the\nrecord, in whole or in part, as provided in section\n1550.9\nof this Part. (e) The records access\nofficer shall respond promptly to a request for records and, except under\nextraordinary circumstances, his response shall be made no more than five\nworkdays after receipt of the request for inspection; provided, however, if for\nany reason more than five workdays are required to produce the records\nrequested, the records access officer shall acknowledge receipt of the request\nwithin five workdays after the request is received and advise the applicant\nwith a brief explanation of the reason for delay and an estimate of the date\nproduction or denial of the records will be forthcoming. If access to records\nis neither granted nor denied within 10 workdays after the date of\nacknowledgment of receipt of a request for records, the request may be\nconstrued as a denial of access that may be appealed. (f) Upon request therefor, the records access\nofficer shall certify that a transcript of a record of the fund is a true copy\nthereof, or, as the case may be, that he does not have possession of the\nrecords requested or that the same cannot be found after diligent\nsearch.
