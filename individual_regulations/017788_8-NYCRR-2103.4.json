Tit. 8 § 2103.4 - Application procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) After\nhaving submitted and been denied on two separate loan applications by two\nseparate lenders, the student must provide the corporation with these loan\ndenials, along with a letter requesting an LLR loan. If the student has a prior\nloan, one denial must be from the lender which made that loan. Upon receipt of\nthe above from the student, the corporation will send the student an LLR loan\napplication/promissory note. (b) The student must complete the borrower section of the LLR application, sign the\npromissory note, retain the borrower copy of the LLR application/promissory\nnote and forward the lender, school and NYSHESC copies of the LLR\napplication/promissory note to the school.
