  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 575.4 - Liability for tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1404\n(a) The real estate transfer tax shall be\npaid by the grantor. If the grantor has failed to pay the tax at the time\ndescribed in section\n575.14\nof this\n\nPart or if the grantor is exempt from the tax, the grantee will have the duty\nto pay the tax. Where the grantee has the duty to pay the tax because the\ngrantor has failed to pay, the tax is the joint and several liability of the\ngrantor and the grantee. (b) (1)\n\nTax paid by grantee. Where a grantee\nagrees, as part of the consideration for the conveyance, to pay the transfer\ntax imposed by section\n1402\nof the Tax Law and described in section\n575.2\nof this\n\nPart, the tax is computed as follows: (i) Compute the tax based upon consideration exclusive of the transfer tax\nliability assumed by the grantee. (ii)\n\nAdd the tax computed under (i) to the\nconsideration used in (i) and compute the tax on the total amount. Example 1: A one-family house, which is the grantor's residence, is\nsold for $2,000,000. There are no liens or other encumbrances on the property\nat the time of conveyance. The sales contract provides that the grantee will\npay the transfer tax for the grantor. The grantee would compute the tax as\nfollows: $2,000,000 ÷ $500 = 4,000 × $2 = $8,000\n$2,008,000 ÷ $500 = 4,016 × $2 = $8,032 Tax\n\nDue\n(2)\n\nThe\npayment of the transfer tax by the grantee for the grantor would also\nconstitute additional consideration to the grantor in computing the additional\ntax imposed by section\n1402-a\nof the Tax Law on the grantee. Example 2: Assume the same facts as in Example 1. The grantee would\ncompute the additional tax as follows: Consideration\n$2,000,000\n\nTransfer tax paid by grantee\n8,032\n\nTotal consideration\n$2,008,032\n\nTax rate\n×.01\n\nAdditional tax due\n$20,008.32\n(c) (1)\n\nThe\nadditional tax shall be paid by the grantee. If the grantee is exempt from such\ntax, the grantor has the duty to pay the tax. (2)\n\nAdditional tax paid by grantor. Where the\ngrantee is personally liable for payment of the additional tax imposed by\nsection\n1402-a\nof the Tax Law and described in\nsection\n575.3\nof this Part, payment of the tax by the grantor is considered to be an expense\nconnected with the conveyance of the property. The consideration received by\nthe grantor cannot be reduced by the amount of additional tax paid by the\ngrantor. Example: A one-family house, which is the grantor's residence, is\nsold for consideration of $1,400,000. The sales contract provides that the\ngrantor will pay the additional tax for the grantee. The grantor would be\nrequired to pay additional tax of $14,000 (.01 × $1,400,000). The grantor would\nalso be liable for payment of transfer tax in the amount of $5600 ($2 for each\n$500, or fractional part thereof, of consideration of\n$1,400,000). (d) All conveyances are presumed taxable. Where the consideration paid, or required\nto be paid, includes property other than money, the consideration is presumed\nto be the fair market value of the real property or interest therein. These\npresumptions may be rebutted by the person liable for payment of the\ntax. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
