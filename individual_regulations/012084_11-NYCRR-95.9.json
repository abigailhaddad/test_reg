(ii)\n\nExcept as provided in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, each company required to prepare the memorandum shall submit the memorandum to the superintendent as part of the actuarial opinion. (iii)\n\nIf a foreign or alien company has submitted to the insurance regulator of a state accredited by the NAIC a memorandum in support of an opinion of an appointed actuary for the prior year, which was in form and substance acceptable to such insurance regulator as evidenced in writing and was in support of an opinion of an appointed actuary that was required by laws or regulations of that state to meet standards adopted from time to time by the Actuarial Standards Board and such additional standards as such insurance regulator has prescribed, such foreign or alien company need submit the memorandum required by this section only at the request of the superintendent. (2)\n\nIn preparing the memorandum, the appointed actuary may rely on, and include as a part of his or her own memorandum, memoranda prepared and signed by other actuaries who are qualified actuaries within the meaning of section\n95.5\n(d) of this Part, with respect to the areas covered in such memoranda, and so state in their memoranda. (3)\n\nIf the superintendent finds that the analysis described in any such memorandum fails to meet the standards of the Actuarial Standards Board or the standards and requirements of this Part, the superintendent may designate a qualified actuary (the \"reviewing actuary\") to review the opinion and prepare such supporting memorandum as is required for review. The reasonable and necessary expenses of the independent review shall be paid by the company but the review shall be directed and controlled by the superintendent. (4)\n\nThe reviewing actuary shall have the same status as an examiner for the purposes of obtaining data from the company, and the work papers and documentation of the reviewing actuary shall be retained by the superintendent; provided, however, that any information provided by the company to the reviewing actuary and included in the work papers shall be considered as material provided by the company to the superintendent and shall be kept confidential to the same extent as is prescribed by law and in this Part with respect to other material provided by the company to the superintendent pursuant to the statute governing this Part.
