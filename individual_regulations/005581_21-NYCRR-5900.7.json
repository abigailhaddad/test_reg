In the event that\none or more deletion is so made from any document, the records access officer\nshall provide written notice of that fact to the person given access to the\nrecord. If the record is such that the personal matters cannot be fully deleted\nwithout substantively affecting the record, or the identifying details cannot\nbe effectively deleted, the records access officer shall deny access to such\nrecord as provided in section\n5900.8\nof this Part. (b) Information that is submitted to the\nfoundation in the course of rendering its services, or is derived from such\ninformation, may be excepted from disclosure pursuant to section\n87\n(2)(d)\nof the Public Officers Law on the\ngrounds that the information contains trade secrets, proprietary information, or that the information if disclosed would cause substantial injury to the\ncompetitive position of the enterprise submitting such information. An\nenterprise may submit a request to the records access officer seeking an\nexception as provided for herein. Such exception may extend to information\ncontained in the request itself, if disclosure would defeat the purpose for\nwhich the exception is sought. (c) The request for such an exception shall be in writing and state the reasons for\nthe requested exception. It shall also specify the information or portions of\nthe information for which the exception is requested. (d) Information submitted as provided in\nsubdivisions (b) and (c) of this section shall be kept in the custody of the\nrecords access officer, and it shall be his duty to make determinations\nconcerning the designation of other individuals within the foundation who may\ninspect such records. Any such designation shall be in writing and shall be\navailable for inspection. (e) Information submitted as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section\nshall be excepted from disclosure and shall be maintained apart from all other\nrecords, in a locked file cabinet or other secure facility, until 15 days after\nthe entitlement to such exception has been finally determined or such further\ntime as may be ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. (f) On the initiative of the foundation at\nany time, or upon the request of any person for a record excepted from\ndisclosure pursuant to subdivisions (b) and following of this section, the\nfoundation shall: (1)\ngive notice to the\nperson who requested the exception of any request for disclosure and/or of the\nfoundation's intention to determine whether such exception should be granted or\ncontinued; (2)\npermit the person\nwho asked for the exception, within 10 business days of receipt of such notice\nfrom the foundation, to submit a written statement of the necessity for the\ngranting or continuation of the exception from disclosure; (3)\nwithin seven business days of receipt of\nsuch written statement, or within seven business days of the expiration of the\nperiod prescribed for submission of such statement, issue a written\ndetermination granting, continuing or terminating the exception from disclosure\nand stating the reasons therefor; copies of such determination shall be served\nupon the person, if any, requesting the record, the person who asked for the\nexception and the Committee on Public Access to Records. (g) A denial of an exception from disclosure\nunder subdivision (f) of this section may be appealed by the person submitting\nthe information, and a denial of access to the record may be appealed by the\nperson requesting the record, as follows: (1)\n\nWithin seven business days of receipt of written notice denying the request for\nan exception or for disclosure, the person asking for the exception or the\nperson requesting disclosure may appeal to the counsel of the\nfoundation. (2)\n\nThe appeal must be\nin writing and set forth: the name and address of the person asking for the\nexception or the person requesting disclosure; the date of asking for an\nexception or of the request for disclosure, and to whom it was delivered; the\nspecific record to which exception or disclosure was denied; the reasons given\nfor such denial; and whether the denial was in writing or is considered to be a\ndenial because of failure of the foundation to respond in a timely\nmanner. (3)\n\nThe appeal shall be\ndetermined within 10 business days of the receipt of the appeal. Written notice\nof the determination shall be served upon the person, if any, requesting the\nrecord, the person who asked for the exception and the Committee on Public\n\nAccess to Records. The notice shall contain a statement of the reasons for the\ndetermination. (h) A\nproceeding to review an adverse determination pursuant to subdivision (g) of\nthis section may be commenced pursuant to article 78 of the Civil Practice Law\nand Rules; provided, however, that such proceeding must be commenced within 15\ndays of the service of the written notice containing the adverse determination\nprovided for in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.
