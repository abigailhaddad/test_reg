In\norder to allow time to comply with a provision of this Part, a racetrack\noperator may submit a written request to the executive director for a variance. Such variance request shall not be granted unless the racetrack operator\ndemonstrates that the health and safety of the housing occupants and the public\nwill not be prejudiced by the variance and that there are practical\ndifficulties or hardships in immediate compliance with the provisions. A\nracetrack operator shall meet all terms of an approved variance, including the\neffective date, the time period for which the variance is granted, the\nrequirements being varied and any special conditions the executive director\nspecifies. A variance shall end one year from its date of issuance, unless such\nvariance is granted for a lesser period of time or otherwise\nextended. (b) Waiver. In order to\naccept alternative arrangements that do not meet a provision of this Part, a\nracetrack operator may submit a written request to the executive director for a\nwaiver from a specific provision of this Part. Such request shall not be\ngranted unless the racetrack operator can demonstrate that circumstances exist\nthat are beyond the control of the racetrack operator, compliance with the\nprovision would present a hardship and that the public and housing occupants'\nhealth and safety will not be endangered by granting such a waiver. A racetrack\noperator must meet all terms of any approved waiver. A waiver shall remain in\neffect indefinitely unless revoked by the executive director. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
