  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1644-3.4 - Recording the interest accrual\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe charge for interest accrued on bonds is to account\n1420.1, Interest, for interest accrued prior to the date of substantial\ncompletion, and applicable to the development period, and to account 4716, Interest on Indebtedness, for interest accrued subsequent to the date of\nsubstantial completion, and applicable to the operating period. The date of\nsubstantial completion is considered as the first day of the operating period. The credit for interest accrued on housing bonds is made to account 2132.1, Accrued Interest Payable-- State of New York. A further allocation of interest\ncharges to the cost of related programs should then be made as described in\nsection\n1644-2.4\nof this Part. However, after the bonds have been issued, the basis for the allocation is the\nproportion that the amount borrowed for the related program in the bond sale\nbudget bears to the total bond issue. Prior to the issuance of bonds, it will\nbe recalled, the basis of the allocation is the proportion that the amount\nrequisitioned for the related program on the most recent certificate of\npurposes bears to the total amount borrowed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1644-3.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
