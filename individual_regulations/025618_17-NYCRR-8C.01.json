  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 8C.01 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\nINSERT the following paragraphs: Standard: 06A When an overhead flashing-light signal is used, the\nvertical clearance shall be no more than 19 feet above the crown of the highway\nto the lowest point of the signal unit. Standard: 12A When used, the devices shall be operated continuously\n(unless not required by the appropriate operating standards) except as provided\nin paragraph 12B. Option: 12B Special control features may be provided for making the\ndevices insensitive to train actuation while trains are performing regular\nstops or switching operations in the vicinity of a crossing, to prevent\nexcessive activation of the traffic control devices. Standard: 12C When the Option is enacted, provisions shall be made to\nensure that the devices are again made operative for the required time before\nany rail traffic proceeds over the crossing. Provision shall also be made to\nensure that automatic operation of the devices will resume upon the approach of\nany rail traffic other than the one for which operation of the device was\ndiscontinued. Support: 12D Since grade crossing traffic control devices govern the\nactions of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, the principles of uniformity and\nstandardization apply to these devices. Guidance: 12E For the purpose of signal control, crossings more than\n100 feet apart should be treated separately. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n8C.01\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
