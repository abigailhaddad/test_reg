  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 360-2.8 - Right to a conference\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn MA applicant/recipient who disagrees with a decision\nof the social services district concerning his/her case may request a\nconference, as described in Part 358 of this Title. At the conference the\napplicant/recipient will meet with a district representative having the\nauthority to change the district's decision. The district representative will\nreview the district's decision, answer any questions the applicant/recipient\nhas, and will consider any information the applicant/recipient presents. A\nrequest for a conference is not a request for a fair hearing and does not\nentitle the applicant/recipient to aid continuing pending the outcome of the\nconference. The applicant/recipient may still request a fair hearing, even if a\nconference has been requested. However, the deadline for requesting a fair\nhearing will remain the same whether or not a conference is\nrequested. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§§\n360-2.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
