(1)\n\nEach licensee or registrant shall use the SI units- becquerel, gray, sievert and coulomb per kilogram, or the special units: curie, rad, rem, and roentgen, including multiples and subdivisions, and shall clearly indicate the units of all quantities on records required by this Part. (2)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall make a clear distinction among the quantities entered on the records required by this Part, such as, total effective dose equivalent, shallow dose equivalent, eye dose equivalent, deep dose equivalent, or committed effective dose equivalent. (3)\n\nForm of records. Each record required by this Part shall be legible throughout the specified retention period. The record shall be the original or a reproduced copy or a microform, provided that the copy of microform is authenticated by authorized personnel and that the microform is capable of producing a clear copy throughout the required retention period, or the record may also be stored in electronic media with the capability for producing legible, accurate, and complete records during the required retention period. Records, such as letters, drawings, and specifications shall include pertinent information, such as stamps, initials, and signatures. The licensee shall maintain safeguards sufficient to prevent tampering with and loss of records. (4)\n\nThe discontinuance of or curtailment of activities does not relieve any person who possesses any radiation source of responsibility for retaining all records required by this Part.

(2)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall retain each of the following records until the department authorizes the disposition of these records: (i) records of the results of surveys to determine the dose from external sources of radiation used, in the absence of or in combination with individual monitoring data, in the assessment of individual dose equivalents; and\n(ii)\nrecords of the results of measurements and calculations used to determine individual intakes of radioactive material and used in the assessment of internal dose; and\n(iii)\nrecords showing the results of air sampling, surveys, and bioassays required pursuant to section\n16.26\n(c)(1)(iii)(a) and (b)\nof this Part; and\n(iv)\nrecords of the results of measurements and calculations used to evaluate the release of radioactive effluents to the environment. (3)\n\nUpon termination of the license or registration, the licensee or registrant shall permanently store records on department form \"Cumulative Occupational Radiation Exposure History\" or equivalent, until disposition is authorized by the department. (4)\n\nRecords of tests for leakage or contamination of sealed sources. Records of tests for leakage or contamination of sealed sources required by section\n16.10\n(a)(4)\nof this Part shall be kept in units of becquerel or microcuries and maintained for inspection by the department. (d) Records of prior occupational dose. (1)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall retain the records of prior occupational dose and exposure history as specified in section\n16.6\n(e) of this Part on department form \"Cumulative Occupational Radiation Exposure History\" or equivalent, and the records used in preparing department form \"Cumulative Occupational Radiation Exposure History\" until disposition is authorized by the department. (2)\n\nUpon termination of the license or registration, the licensee or registrant shall permanently store records on department form \"Cumulative Occupational Radiation Exposure History\" or equivalent, or shall make provision with the department for transfer to the department. (e) Records of planned special exposures. (1)\n\nFor each of the provisions of section\n16.6\n(f) of this Part for planned special exposures, the licensee or registrant shall maintain records that describe: (i) the exceptional circumstances requiring the use of a planned special exposure; and\n(ii)\nthe name of the management official who authorized the planned special exposure and a copy of the signed authorization; and\n(iii)\nwhat actions were necessary; and\n(iv)\nwhy the actions were necessary; and\n(v) what precautions were taken to assure that doses were maintained ALARA; and\n(vi)\nwhat individual and collective doses were expected to result; and\n(vii)\nthe doses actually received in the planned special exposure. (2)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall retain the records until disposition is authorized by the department. (3)\n\nUpon termination of the license or registration, the licensee or registrant shall permanently store records on department form \"Cumulative Occupational Radiation Exposure History\", or until disposition is authorized by the department. (f) Records of individual monitoring results. (1)\n\nRecordkeeping requirement. Each licensee or registrant shall maintain records of doses received by all individuals for whom monitoring was required pursuant to section\n16.11\nof this Part, and records of doses received during planned special exposures, accidents, and emergency conditions. Assessments of dose equivalent and records made using units in effect before the effective date of this Part need not be changed. These records shall include, when applicable: (i) the deep dose equivalent to the whole body, eye dose equivalent, shallow dose equivalent to the skin, and shallow dose equivalent to the extremities; and\n(ii)\nthe estimated intake or body burden of radionuclides, see section\n16.6\n(b) of this Part; and\n(iii)\nthe committed effective dose equivalent assigned to the intake or body burden of radionuclides; and\n(iv)\nthe specific information used to calculate the committed effective dose equivalent pursuant to section\n16.6\n(d) of this Part; and\n(v) the total effective dose equivalent when required by section\n16.6\n(b) of this Part; and\n(vi)\nthe total of the deep dose equivalent and the committed dose to the organ receiving the highest total dose. (2)\n\nRecordkeeping frequency. The licensee or registrant shall make entries of the records specified in this subdivision at least annually. (3)\n\nRecordkeeping format. The licensee or registrant shall maintain the records specified in this subdivision on department form \"Occupational Radiation Exposure Record for a Monitoring Period\", or in clear and legible records containing all the information required by such form.
