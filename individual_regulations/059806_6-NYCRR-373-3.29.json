(b) If the commissioner determines that the\nmethod used by the owner or operator was not appropriate for the hazardous\nwaste managed in the tank, surface impoundment, or container, then the\ncommissioner may choose an appropriate method. (iii)\n\nIn a case when the owner or operator is\nrequested to perform the waste determination, the commissioner may elect to\nhave an authorized representative observe the collection of the hazardous waste\nsamples used for the analysis. (iv)\n\nIn a case when the results of the waste determination performed or requested by\nthe commissioner do not agree with the results of a waste determination\nperformed by the owner or operator using knowledge of the waste, then the\nresults of the waste determination performed in accordance with the\nrequirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall be used to establish\ncompliance with the requirements of this section. (v) In a case when the owner or operator has\nused an averaging period greater than one hour for determining the average VO\nconcentration of a hazardous waste at the point of waste origination, the\ncommissioner may elect to establish compliance with this section by performing\nor requesting that the owner or operator perform a waste determination using\ndirect measurement based on waste samples collected within a one-hour period as\nfollows: (a) The average VO concentration of\nthe hazardous waste at the point of waste origination shall be determined by\ndirect measurement in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of\nthis section. (b) Results of the\nwaste determination performed or requested by the commissioner showing that the\naverage VO concentration of the hazardous waste at the point of waste\norigination is equal to or greater than 500 ppmw shall constitute noncompliance\nwith this section except in a case as provided for in clause\n(\nc\n) of this subparagraph. (c) For the case when the average VO\nconcentration of the hazardous waste at the point of waste origination\npreviously has been determined by the owner or operator using an averaging\nperiod greater than one hour to be less than 500 ppmw but because of normal\noperating process variations the VO concentration of the hazardous waste\ndetermined by direct measurement for any given one-hour period may be equal to\nor greater than 500 ppmw, information that was used by the owner or operator to\ndetermine the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste\n(\ne.g., test results, measurements, calculations, and other\ndocumentation) and recorded in the facility records in accordance with the\nrequirements of paragraph (e)(1) and subdivision (k) of this section shall be\nconsidered by the commissioner together with the results of the waste\ndetermination performed or requested by the commissioner in establishing\ncompliance with this section. (e) Waste determination\nprocedures. (1)\n\nWaste determination\nprocedure to determine average volatile organic (VO) concentration of a\nhazardous waste at the point of waste origination. (i) An owner or operator shall determine the\naverage VO concentration at the point of waste origination for each hazardous\nwaste placed in a waste management unit exempted under the provisions of\nsubparagraph (d)(3)(i) of this section from using air emission controls in\naccordance with standards specified in subdivisions (f) through (i) of this\nsection, as applicable to the waste management unit. (a) An initial determination of the average\nVO concentration of the waste stream shall be made before the first time any\nportion of the material in the hazardous waste stream is placed in a waste\nmanagement unit exempted under the provisions of subparagraph (d)(3)(i) of this\nsection from using air emission controls, and thereafter an initial\ndetermination of the average VO concentration of the waste stream shall be made\nfor each averaging period that a hazardous waste is managed in the\nunit. (b) Perform a new waste\ndetermination whenever changes to the source generating the waste stream are\nreasonably likely to cause the average VO concentration of the hazardous waste\nto increase to a level that is equal to or greater than the VO concentration\nlimit specified in subparagraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. (ii)\n\nFor a waste determination that is\nrequired by subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the average VO concentration of\na hazardous waste at the point of waste origination shall be determined using\neither direct measurement as specified in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph\nor by knowledge as specified in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. (iii)\n\nDirect measurement to determine average\nVO concentration of a hazardous waste at the point of waste origination. (a) Identification. The owner or operator\nshall identify and record the point of waste origination for the hazardous\nwaste. (b) Sampling. Samples of the\nhazardous waste stream shall be collected at the point of waste origination in\nmanner such that volatilization of organics contained in the waste and in the\nsubsequent sample is minimized and an adequately representative sample is\ncollected and maintained for analysis by the selected method. (1)\n\nThe averaging period to be used for\ndetermining the average VO concentration for the hazardous waste stream on a\nmass-weighted average basis shall be designated and recorded. The averaging\nperiod can represent any time interval that the owner or operator determines is\nappropriate for the hazardous waste stream but shall not exceed one\nyear. (2)\nA sufficient number of\nsamples, but no less than four samples, shall be collected and analyzed for a\nhazardous waste determination. All of the samples for a given waste\ndetermination shall be collected within a one-hour period. The average of the\nfour or more sample results constitutes a waste determination for the waste\nstream. One or more waste determinations may be required to represent the\ncomplete range of waste compositions and quantities that occur during the\nentire averaging period due to normal variations in the operating conditions\nfor the source or process generating the hazardous waste stream. Examples of\nsuch normal variations are seasonal variations in waste quantity or\nfluctuations in ambient temperature. (3)\n\nAll samples shall be collected and\nhandled in accordance with written procedures prepared by the owner or operator\nand documented in a site sampling plan. This plan shall describe the procedure\nby which representative samples of the hazardous waste stream are collected\nsuch that a minimum loss of organics occurs throughout the sample collection\nand handling process, and by which sample integrity is maintained. A copy of\nthe written sampling plan shall be maintained on-site in the facility operating\nrecords. An example of acceptable sample collection and handling procedures for\ntotal volatile organic constituent concentration may be found in Method 25D in\n40 CFR part\n60, appendix A as incorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of\nthis Title. (4)\n\nSufficient\ninformation, as specified in the site-sampling plan required under subclause\n(\n3\n) of this clause, shall be prepared and recorded to document\nthe waste quantity represented by the samples and, as applicable, the operating\nconditions for the source or process generating the hazardous waste represented\nby the samples. (c) Analysis. Each collected sample shall be prepared and analyzed in accordance\nwith method 25D in 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A as incorporated by reference in\nsection 370.1(e) of this Title, for the total concentration of volatile organic\nconstituents, or using one or more methods when the individual organic compound\nconcentrations are identified and summed and the summed waste concentration\naccounts for and reflects all organic compounds in the waste with Henry's Law\nconstant values at least\n0.1mole-fraction-in-the-gas-phase/mole-fraction-in-the-liquid-phase (0.1y/x)\n(which can also be expressed as 1.8 x 10\n-6\natmospheres/gram mole/m3) at 25°C. At the owner's or operator's discretion, the owner or operator may adjust test data obtained by any appropriate method\nto discount any contribution to the total volatile organic concentration that\nis the result of including a compound with a Henry's Law constant value of less\nthan 0.1Y/X at 25°C. To adjust these data, the measured concentration of\neach individual chemical constituent contained in the waste is multiplied by\nthe appropriate constituent specific adjustment factor\n(f\nm25D\n). If the owner or operator elects to adjust test\ndata, the adjustment must be made to all individual chemical constituents with\na Henry's Law constant value greater than or equal to 0.1Y/X at 25°C\ncontained in the waste. Constituent specific adjustment factors\n(f\nm25D\n) can be obtained by contacting the Waste and\n\nChemical Processes Group, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711. Other test methods may be used if they meet\nthe requirements in subclause (\n1\n) or (\n2\n) of\nthis clause and provided the requirement to reflect all organic compounds in\nthe waste with Henry's Law constant values greater than or equal to 0.1Y/X\n(which can also be expressed as 1.8 x 10\n-6\natmospheres/gram-mole/m\n3\n) at 25°C, is met. (1)\n\nAny EPA standard method that has been\nvalidated in accordance with \"Alternative Validation Procedure for EPA Waste\nand Wastewater Methods,\" 40 CFR part\n63, appendix D, as incorporated by\nreference in section 370.1(e) of this Title. (2)\n\nAny other analysis method that has been\nvalidated in accordance with the procedures specified in section 5.1 or 5.3, and the corresponding calculations in section 6.1 or\n6.3, of Method 301 in 40 CFR part\n63, appendix A, as incorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title. The data are acceptable if they meet the criteria specified in section\n6.1.5 or 6.3.3 of Method 301. If\ncorrection is required under section\n6.3.3 of Method 301, the data are\nacceptable if the correction factor is within the range 0.7 to 1.30. Other\nsections of Method 301 are not required. (d) Calculations. (1)\n\nThe average VO concentration (C) on a\nmass-weighted basis shall be calculated by using the results for all waste\ndeterminations conducted in accordance with clauses (\nb\n) and\n(\nc\n) of this subparagraph and the following equation: Click\nto view image\n\nWhere: C = Average VO concentration of the hazardous waste at\nthe point of waste origination on a mass-weighted basis, ppmw. i = Individual waste determination \"i\" of the hazardous\nwaste. n = Total number of waste determinations of the hazardous\nwaste conducted for the averaging period (not to exceed 1 year). Q\ni\n= Mass quantity of hazardous\nwaste stream represented by C\ni, kg/hr. Q\nT\n= Total mass quantity of\nhazardous waste during the averaging period, kg/hr. C\ni\n= Measured VO concentration of\nwaste determination \"i\" as determined in accordance with the requirements of\nclause (\nc\n) of this subparagraph, (\ni.e., the\naverage of the four of more samples specified in subclause\n[\nb\n][\n2\n] of this subparagraph), ppmw. (2)\n\nFor the purpose of\ndetermining C\ni, for individual waste samples analyzed in\naccordance with clause (\nc\n) of this subparagraph, the owner or\noperator shall account for VO concentrations determined to be below the limit\nof detection of the analytical method by using the following VO concentration: (i) If Method 25D in 40 CFR part\n60, appendix\nA, as incorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title, is used for\nthe analysis, one-half the blank value determined in the method at section 4.4\nof Method 25D in 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, as incorporated by reference in\nsection 370.1(e) of this Title. (ii)\n\nIf any other analytical method is used, one-half the sum of the limits of detection established for each organic\nconstituent in the waste that has a Henry's Law constant values at least 0.1\nmole-fraction-in-the-gas-phase/mole-fraction-in-the-liquid-phase (0.1Y/X)\n(which can be expressed as 1.8 ×- 10\n-6\natmospheres/gram-mole/m\n3\n) at 25°C. (e) Provided that the\ntest method is appropriate for the waste as required under clause\n(\nc\n) of this subparagraph, the department will determine\ncompliance based on the test method used by the owner or operator as recorded\npursuant to subparagraph (k)(6)(i) of this section. (iv)\n\nUse of owner or operator knowledge to\ndetermine average VO concentration of a hazardous waste at the point of waste\norigination. (a) Documentation shall be\nprepared that presents the information used as the basis for the owner's or\noperator's knowledge of the hazardous waste stream's average VO concentration. Examples of information that may be used as the basis for knowledge include: material balances for the source or process generating the hazardous waste\nstream; constituent-specific chemical test data for the hazardous waste stream\nfrom previous testing that are still applicable to the current waste stream; previous test data for other locations managing the same type of waste stream; or other knowledge based on information included in manifests, shipping papers, or waste certification notices. (b) If test data are used as the basis for knowledge, then the owner or operator\nshall document the test method, sampling protocol, and the means by which\nsampling variability and analytical variability are accounted for in the\ndetermination of the average VO concentration. For example, an owner or\noperator may use organic concentration test data for the hazardous waste stream\nthat are validated in accordance with Method 301 in 40 CFR part\n63, appendix A, as incorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title, as the basis\nfor knowledge of the waste. (c) An\nowner or operator using chemical constituent-specific concentration test data\nas the basis for knowledge of the hazardous waste may adjust the test data to\nthe corresponding average VO concentration value which would have been obtained\nhad the waste samples been analyzed using Method 25D in 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A as incorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title. To\nadjust these data, the measured concentration for each individual chemical\nconstituent contained in the waste is multiplied by the appropriate\nconstituent-specific adjustment factor\n(f\nm25D\n). (d) In the event that the commissioner and the owner or operator disagree on a\ndetermination of the average VO concentration for a hazardous waste stream\nusing knowledge, then the results from a determination of average VO\nconcentration using direct measurement as specified in subparagraph (iii) of\nthis paragraph shall be used to establish compliance with the applicable\nrequirements of this section. The commissioner may perform or request that the\nowner or operator perform this determination using direct measurement. The\nowner or operator may choose one or more appropriate methods to analyze each\ncollected sample in accordance with the requirements of clause\n(iii)(\nc\n) of this paragraph. (2)\n\nWaste determination procedures for\ntreated hazardous waste. (i) An owner or\noperator shall perform the applicable waste determination for each treated\nhazardous waste placed in a waste management unit exempted under the provisions\nof clauses (d)(3)(ii)(\na\n) through (\nf\n) of this\nsection from using air emission controls in accordance with standards specified\nin subdivisions (f) through (i) of this section, as applicable to the waste\nmanagement unit. (a) An initial determination\nof the average VO concentration of the waste stream shall be made before the\nfirst time any portion of the material in the treated waste stream is placed in\na waste management unit exempted under the provisions of subparagraph\n(d)(3)(ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section from using air emission controls, and\nthereafter update the information used for the waste determination at least\nonce every 12 months following the date of the initial waste\ndetermination. (b) Perform a new\nwaste determination whenever changes to the process generating or treating the\nwaste stream are reasonably likely to cause the average VO concentration of the\nhazardous waste to increase to a level such that the applicable treatment\nconditions specified in subparagraph (d)(3)(ii), (iii) or (iv) of this section\nare not achieved. (ii)\n\nThe owner or operator shall designate and record the specific provision in\nsubparagraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section under which the waste determination is\nbeing performed. The waste determination for the treated hazardous waste shall\nbe performed using the applicable procedures specified in applicable\nsubparagraphs (iii) through (ix) of this paragraph. (iii)\n\nProcedure to determine the average VO\nconcentration of a hazardous waste at the point of waste treatment. (a) Identification. The owner or operator\nshall identify and record the point of waste treatment for the hazardous\nwaste. (b) Sampling. Samples of the\nhazardous waste stream shall be collected at the point of waste treatment in a\nmanner such that volatilization of organics contained in the waste and in the\nsubsequent sample is minimized and an adequately representative sample is\ncollected and maintained for analysis by the selected method. (1)\n\nThe averaging period to be used for\ndetermining average VO concentration for the hazardous waste stream on a\nmass-weighted average basis shall be designated and recorded. The averaging\nperiod can represent any time interval that the owner or operator determines is\nappropriate for the hazardous waste stream but shall not exceed one\nyear. (2)\nA sufficient number of\nsamples, but no less than four samples, shall be collected and analyzed for a\nhazardous waste determination. All of the samples for a given waste\ndetermination shall be collected within a one-hour period. The average of the\nfour or more sample results constitutes a waste determination for the waste\nstream. One or more waste determinations may be required to represent the\ncomplete range of waste compositions and quantities that occur during the\nentire averaging period due to normal variations in the operating conditions\nfor the process generating or treating the hazardous waste stream. Examples of\nsuch normal variations are seasonal variations in waste quantity or\nfluctuations in ambient temperature. (3)\n\nAll samples shall be collected and\nhandled in accordance with written procedures prepared by the owner or operator\nand documented in a site sampling plan. This plan shall describe the procedure\nby which representative samples of the hazardous waste stream are collected\nsuch that a minimum loss of organics occurs throughout the sample collection\nand handling process, and by which sample integrity is maintained. A copy of\nthe written sampling plan shall be maintained on-site in the facility operating\nrecords. An example of an acceptable sample collection and handling procedures\nfor a total volatile organic constituent concentration may be found in Method\n25D in 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1(e) of this Title. (4)\n\nSufficient information, as specified in the site sampling plan required under\nsubclause (\n3\n) of this clause, this clause, shall be prepared\nand recorded to document the waste quantity represented by the samples and, as\napplicable, the operating conditions for the process treating the hazardous\nwaste represented by the samples. (c) Analysis. Each collected sample shall be\nprepared and analyzed in accordance with Method 25D in 40 CFR part\n60, appendix\nA, as incorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title, for the\ntotal concentration of volatile organic constituents, or using one or more\nmethods when the individual organic compound concentrations are identified and\nsummed and the summed waste concentration accounts for and reflects all organic\ncompounds in the waste with Henry's Law constant values at least 0.1 mole\nfraction in the gas phase/mole fraction in the liquid phase (0.1 Y/X) (which\ncan also be expressed as 1.8 x 10\n-6\natmospheres/gram\nmole/m\n3\n) at 25°C. When the owner or operator is\nmaking a waste determination for a treated hazardous waste that is to be\ncompared to an average VO concentration at the point of waste origination or\nthe point of waste entry to the treatment system, to determine if the condition\nof section\n373-2.29\n(c)(3)(ii)\n(\na\n) through (\nf\n) of this Part, or clauses\n(d)(3)(ii)(\na\n) through (\nf\n) of this section are\nmet, the waste samples shall be prepared and analyzed using the same method or\nmethods as were used in making the initial waste determinations at the point of\nwaste origination or at the point of entry to the treatment system. At the\nowner's or operator's discretion, the owner or operator may adjust test data\nobtained by any appropriate method to discount any contribution to the total\nvolatile organic concentration that is a result of including a compound with a\n\nHenry's Law constant value less than 0.1 Y/X at 25°C. To adjust these data, the measured concentration of each individual chemical constituent contained in\nthe waste is multiplied by the appropriate constituent specific adjustment\nfactor (f\nm25D\n). If the owner or operator elects to\nadjust test data, the adjustment must be made to all individual chemical\nconstituents with a Henry's Law constant value greater than or equal to 0.1 Y/X\nat 25°C contained in the waste. Constituent specific adjustment factors\n(f\nm25D\n) can be obtained by contacting the Waste and\n\nChemical Processes Group, Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards, Research Triangle Park, NC 27711(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). Other test methods may be used if they meet the requirements of\nsubclause (\n1\n) or (\n2\n) of this clause and\nprovided the requirement to reflect all organic compounds in the waste with\n\nHenry's Law constant values greater than or equal to 0.1 Y/X (which can also be\nexpressed as 1.8 x 10\n-6\natmospheres/gram\nmole/m\n3\n) at 25°C, is met.

The data are acceptable if they meet the criteria specified in section\n6.1.5 or 6.3.3 of Method 301 (see\nsection\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). If correction is required under section\n6.3.3 of Method 301 (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle), the data are acceptable if the correction factor is within the range\n0.7 to 1.30.

(d) F\nbio\n= Fraction of\norganic biodegraded as determined in accordance with the requirements of clause\n(\nc\n) of this subparagraph. (3)\n\nProcedure\nto determine the maximum organic vapor pressure of a hazardous waste in a tank. (i) An owner or operator shall determine the\nmaximum organic vapor pressure for each hazardous waste placed in a tank using\n\nTank Level 1 controls in accordance with standards specified in paragraph\n(f)(3) of this section. (ii)\n\nAn\nowner or operator shall use either direct measurement as specified in\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph or knowledge of the waste as specified by\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph to determine the maximum organic vapor\npressure which is representative of the hazardous waste composition stored or\ntreated in the tank. (iii)\n\nDirect\nmeasurement to determine the maximum organic vapor pressure of a hazardous\nwaste. (a) Sampling. A sufficient number of\nsamples shall be collected to be representative of the waste contained in the\ntank. All samples shall be collected and handled in accordance with written\nprocedures prepared by the owner or operator and documented in a site sampling\nplan. This plan shall describe the procedure by which representative samples of\nthe hazardous waste are collected such that a minimum loss of organics occurs\nthroughout the sample collection and handling process and by which sample\nintegrity is maintained. A copy of the written sampling plan shall be\nmaintained on-site in the facility operating records. An example of acceptable\nsample collection and handling procedures may be found in Method 25D in 40 CFR\npart\n60, appendix A, as incorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this\n\nTitle. (b) Analysis. Any\nappropriate one of the following methods may be used to analyze the samples and\ncompute the maximum organic vapor pressure of the hazardous waste: (1)\n\nMethod 25E in 40 CFR part\n60\nappendix A, as incorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title; (2)\nmethods described in American Petroleum\n\nInstitute Publication 2517, Third Edition, February 1989, \"Evaporative Loss\nfrom External Floating-Roof Tanks,\" as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1(e) of this Title; (3)\nmethods\nobtained from standard reference texts; (4)\nASTM Method 2879-92, as incorporated by\nreference in section 370.1(e) of this Title; and\n(5)\nany other method approved by the\ncommissioner. (iv)\n\nUse of knowledge to determine the\nmaximum organic vapor pressure of the hazardous waste. Documentation shall be\nprepared and recorded that presents the information used as the basis for the\nowner's or operator's knowledge that the maximum organic vapor pressure of the\nhazardous waste is less than the maximum vapor pressure limit listed in clause\n(f)(2)(i)(\na\n) of this section for the applicable tank design\ncapacity category. An example of information that may be used is documentation\nthat the hazardous waste is generated by a process for which at other locations\nit previously has been determined by direct measurement that the waste maximum\norganic vapor pressure is less than the maximum vapor pressure limit for the\nappropriate tank design capacity category. (4)\n\nProcedure for determining no detectable\norganic emissions for the purpose of complying with this section: (i) The test shall be conducted in accordance\nwith the procedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, as\nincorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title. Each potential\nleak interface (\ni.e., a location where organic vapor leakage\ncould occur) on the cover and associated closure devices shall be checked. Potential leak interfaces that are associated with covers and closure devices\ninclude, but are not limited to: the interface of the cover and its foundation\nmounting; the periphery of any opening on the cover and its associated closure\ndevice; and the sealing seat interface on a spring-loaded pressure relief\nvalve. (ii)\n\nThe test shall be\nperformed when the unit contains a hazardous waste having an organic\nconcentration representative of the range of concentrations for the hazardous\nwaste expected to be managed in the unit. During the test, the cover and\nclosure devices shall be secured in the closed position. (iii)\n\nThe detection instrument shall meet the\nperformance criteria of Method 21 of 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, as\nincorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title, except the\ninstrument response factor criteria in section\n3.1.2(a) of Method 21 shall be for\nthe average composition of the organic constituents in the hazardous waste\nplaced in the waste management unit, not for each individual organic\nconstituent. (iv)\n\nThe detection\ninstrument shall be calibrated before use on each day of its use by the\nprocedures specified in Method 21 of 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, as\nincorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title. (v) Calibration gases shall be as follows: (a) zero air (less than 10 ppmv hydrocarbon\nin air); and\n(b) a mixture of\nmethane or n-hexane and air at a concentration of approximately, but less than\n10,000 ppmv methane or n-hexane. (vi)\n\nThe background level shall be determined\naccording to the procedures in Method 21 of 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, as\nincorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title. (vii)\n\nEach potential leak interface shall be\nchecked by traversing the instrument probe around the potential leak interface\nas close to the interface as possible, as described in Method 21 of 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, as incorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title. In the case when the configuration of the cover or closure device prevents a\ncomplete traverse of the interface, all accessible portions of the interface\nshall be sampled. In the case when the configuration of the closure device\nprevents any sampling at the interface and the device is equipped with an\nenclosed extension or horn (\ne.g., some pressure relief\ndevices), the instrument probe inlet shall be placed at approximately the\ncenter of the exhaust area to the atmosphere. (viii)\n\nThe arithmetic difference between the\nmaximum organic concentration indicated by the instrument and the background\nlevel shall be compared with the value of 500 ppmv except when monitoring a\nseal around a rotating shaft that passes through a cover opening, in which case\nthe comparison shall be as specified in subparagraph (ix) of this paragraph. If\nthe difference is less than 500 ppmv, then the potential leak interface is\ndetermined to operate with no detectable organic emissions. (ix)\n\nFor the seals around a rotating shaft\nthat passes through a cover opening, the arithmetic difference between the\nmaximum organic concentration indicated by the instrument and the background\nlevel shall be compared with the value of 10,000 ppmw. If the difference is\nless than 10,000 ppmw, then the potential leak interface is determined to\noperate with no detectable organic emissions. (f) Standards: tanks. (1)\n\nThe provisions of this section apply to\nthe control of air pollutant emissions from tanks for which paragraph (d)(2) of\nthis section references the use of this subdivision for such air emission\ncontrol. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator\nshall control air pollutant emissions from each tank subject to this\nsubdivision in accordance with following requirements, as applicable: (i) For a tank that manages hazardous waste\nthat meets all of the conditions specified in clauses (\na\n)\nthrough (\nc\n) of this subparagraph, the owner or operator shall\ncontrol air pollutant emissions from the tank in accordance with the Tank Level\n1 controls specified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision or Tank Level 2\ncontrols specified in paragraph (4) of this subdivision. (a) The hazardous waste in the tank has a\nmaximum organic vapor pressure which is less than the maximum organic vapor\npressure limit for the tank's design capacity category as follows: (1)\n\nFor a tank design capacity equal to or\ngreater than 151 m\n3, the maximum organic vapor\npressure limit for the tank is 5.2 kPa. (2)\n\nFor a tank design capacity equal to or\ngreater than 75 m\n3\nbut less than 151\nm\n3, the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for the\ntank is 27.6 kPa. (3)\n\nFor a tank\ndesign capacity less than 75 m\n3, the maximum organic\nvapor pressure limit for the tank is 76.6 kPa. (b) The hazardous waste in the tank is not\nheated by the owner or operator to a temperature that is greater than the\ntemperature at which the maximum organic vapor pressure of the hazardous waste\nis determined for the purpose of complying with clause (\na\n) of\nthis subparagraph. (c) The\nhazardous waste in the tank is not treated by the owner or operator using a\nwaste stabilization process, as defined in subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nFor a tank\nthat manages hazardous waste that does not meet all of the conditions specified\nin clauses (\na\n) through (\nc\n) of this\nsubparagraph, the owner or operator shall control air pollutant emissions from\nthe tank by using Tank Level 2 controls in accordance with the requirements of\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision. Examples of tanks required to use Tank Level\n2 controls include: a tank used for a waste stabilization process; and a tank\nfor which the hazardous waste in the tank has a maximum organic vapor pressure\nthat is equal to or greater than the maximum organic vapor pressure limit for\nthe tank's design capacity category as specified in clause\n(i)(\na\n) of this paragraph. (3)\n\nOwners and operators controlling air\npollutant emissions from a tank using Tank Level 1 controls shall meet the\nrequirements specified in subparagraphs (i) through (iv) of this paragraph: (i) The owner or operator shall determine the\nmaximum organic vapor pressure for a hazardous waste to be managed in the tank\nusing Tank Level 1 controls before the first time the hazardous waste is placed\nin the tank. The maximum organic vapor pressure shall be determined using the\nprocedures specified in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. Thereafter, the owner\nor operator shall perform a new determination whenever changes to the hazardous\nwaste managed in the tank could potentially cause the maximum organic vapor\npressure to increase to a level that is equal to or greater than the maximum\norganic vapor pressure limit for the tank design capacity category specified in\nclause (2)(i)(\na\n) of this subdivision, as applicable to the\ntank. (ii)\n\nThe tank shall be\nequipped with a fixed roof designed to meet the following specifications: (a) The fixed roof and its closure devices\nshall be designed to form a continuous barrier over the entire surface area of\nthe hazardous waste in the tank. The fixed roof may be a separate cover\ninstalled on the tank (\ne.g., a removable cover mounted on an\nopen-top tank) or may be an integral part of the tank structural design\n(\ne.g., a horizontal cylindrical tank equipped with a\nhatch). (b) The fixed roof shall be\ninstalled in a manner such that there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or\nother open spaces between roof section joints or between the interface of the\nroof edge and the tank wall. (c) Each opening in the fixed roof, and any manifold system associated with the\nfixed roof, shall be either: (1)\nequipped with\na closure device designed to operate such that when the closure device is\nsecured in the closed position there are no visible cracks, holes, gaps, or\nother open spaces in the closure device or between the perimeter of the opening\nand the closure device; or\n(2)\nconnected by a closed-vent system that is vented to a control device. The\ncontrol device shall remove or destroy organics in the vent stream, and shall\nbe operating whenever hazardous waste is managed in the tank, except as\nprovided for in items (\ni\n) and (\nii\n) of this\nsubclause. (i) During periods it is necessary\nto provide access to the tank for performing the activities of item\n(\nii\n) of this subclause, venting of the vapor headspace\nunderneath the fixed roof to the control device is not required, opening of the\nclosure devices is allowed and removal of the fixed roof is allowed. Following\ncompletion of the activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the\nclosure device in the closed position or reinstall the cover, as acceptable, and resume operation of the control device. (ii)\n\nDuring periods of routine inspection, maintenance, or other activities needed for normal operations, and for the\nremoval of accumulated sludge or other residues from the bottom of the\ntank. (d) The\nfixed roof and its closure devices shall be made of suitable materials that\nwill minimize exposure of the hazardous waste to the atmosphere, to the extent\npractical, and will maintain the integrity of the fixed roof and closure\ndevices throughout their intended service life. Factors to be considered when\nselecting the materials for and designing the fixed roof and closure devices\nshall include: organic vapor permeability, the effects of any contact with the\nhazardous waste or its vapors managed in the tank; the effects of outdoor\nexposure to wind, moisture, and sunlight; and the operating practices used for\nthe tank on which the fixed roof is installed. (iii)\n\nWhenever a hazardous waste is in the\ntank, the fixed roof shall be installed with each closure device secured in the\nclosed position except as follows: (a) Opening of the closure devices or removal of the fixed roof is allowed at the\nfollowing times: (1)\n\nTo provide access to the\ntank for performing routine inspection, maintenance, or other activities needed\nfor normal operations. Examples of such activities include those times when a\nworker needs to open a port to sample the liquid in the tank, or when a worker\nneeds to open a hatch to maintain or repair equipment. Following completion of\nthe activity, the owner or operator shall promptly secure the closure device in\nthe closed position or reinstall the cover, as applicable, to the\ntank. (2)\n\nTo remove accumulated\nsludge or other residues from the bottom of the tank. (b) Opening of a spring-loaded\npressure-vacuum relief valve, conservation vent, or similar type of pressure\nrelief device which vents to the atmosphere is allowed during normal operations\nfor the purpose of maintaining the tank internal pressure in accordance with\nthe tank design specifications. The device shall be designed to operate with no\ndetectable organic emissions when the device is secured in the closed position. The settings at which the device opens shall be established such that the\ndevice remains in the closed position whenever the tank internal pressure is\nwithin the internal pressure operating range determined by the owner or\noperator based on the tank manufacturer recommendations, applicable\nregulations, fire protection and prevention codes, standard engineering codes\nand practices, or other requirements for the safe handling of flammable, ignitable, explosive, reactive, or hazardous materials. Examples of normal\noperating conditions that may require these devices to open are during those\ntimes when the tank internal pressure exceeds the internal pressure operating\nrange for the tank as a result of loading operations or diurnal ambient\ntemperature fluctuations. (c) Opening of a safety device, as defined in subdivision (b) of this section, is\nallowed at any time conditions require doing so to avoid an unsafe\ncondition. (iv)\n\nThe\nowner or operator shall inspect the air emission control equipment in\naccordance with the following requirements. (a) The fixed roof and its closure devices\nshall be visually inspected by the owner or operator to check for defects that\ncould result in air pollutant emissions. Defects include, but are not limited\nto, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the roof sections or between the roof and\nthe tank wall; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on\nclosure devices; and broken or missing hatches, access covers, caps, or other\nclosure devices. (b) The owner or\noperator shall perform an initial inspection of the fixed roof and its closure\ndevices on or before the date that the tank becomes subject to this\nsubdivision. Thereafter, the owner or operator shall perform the inspections at\nleast once every year except under the special conditions provided for in\nparagraph (12) of this subdivision. (c) In the event that a defect is detected, the owner or operator shall repair the defect in accordance with the\nrequirements of paragraph (11) of this subdivision.
