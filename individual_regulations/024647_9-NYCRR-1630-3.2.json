  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1630-3.2 - Insurance to be carried by contractors\n\nState Regulations\n\nDuring construction period, contractors will continue\nto carry forms of insurance referred to under section\n1630-2.2\nto extent they apply. Special attention should be given to the following coverages. (a) Fire and extended coverage insurance. (1)\n\nBefore any contractors commence\nconstruction operations, and before materials are delivered to project site, fire and extended coverage insurance must be obtained. (2)\n\nThis should be included in contract as\ncoverage to be supplied by contractor. It should include name of authority and\ndivision as well as name of contractor. This policy will cover work done on\nproject as construction proceeds, as well as materials on project site, and may\ninclude contractor's equipment. (3)\n\nThis policy may be obtained on either completed value or on monthly reporting\nform. Completed value form is preferable as it eliminates requirement on part\nof contractor and authority of filing monthly reports indicating value of\ncompleted work. In addition, it is usually much lower in cost. Regardless of\nwhich type of policy is obtained, in no event shall coverage be less than full\ninsurable interest. (4)\n\nCoverage is\nto be continued from time contractor starts until time he finishes his work. If\nauthority determines that a certificate of occupancy issued for a specific\nbuilding on project site constitutes completion of contractor's operations\nsubject to punch list items insofar as that building is concerned, authority\nmay notify contractor to reduce his builder's risk coverage and simultaneously\nauthority may then place fire coverage on said building to protect its interest\nas owner. There shall be a continuity of insurance. (5)\n\nIn event that contractor's equipment is\nincluded in coverage, completed value form must be written in a sufficient\namount to include value of contractor's equipment as well as completed value of\nproject. (b) Insurance\non materials stored offsite. Those materials for project that are stored on\nproject site shall be covered for fire and extended coverage perils under\nbuilder's risk policy referred to above. In certain cases, however, authority\nshould see that fire and extended coverage, and mercantile burglary and theft\ninsurance are obtained for such offsite materials. In event that these\nmaterials have been paid for by authority directly, authority should effect\nsuch insurance. If included in contractor's payments, coverage should be\nobtained from contractor.
