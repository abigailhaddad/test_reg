Sewer rates for the CSIRU class\nare determined by total metered water consumption in each quarter. The schedule\nof quarterly charges for the CSIRU class shall be as follows: SCHEDULE I\nMinimum charge per quarter: $60.55\nwith a\nusage allowance of up to 1,300 cubic feet\n\nAdditional usage in excess of 1,300: $4.66\nper 100 cubic feet\n\nThe following rates shall be charged and collected for the\nuse of sewer outside the city for residential and commercial purposes as\ndetermined by total metered water consumption per quarter. The schedule of\nquarterly charges for the users outside the city shall be as follows: Minimum charge per quarter: $162.22\nwith a\nusage allowance of up to 1,300 cubic feet\n\nAdditional usage in excess of 1,300: $12.47\nper 100 cubic feet\n(2)\nSIU. (i) Conventional pollutant parameter charges. Sewer rates for the SIU class each quarter are based on measured quantities of\nthe actual discharge parameters: flow, suspended solids and soluble organic\ncarbon. Such determination shall be made by the water board and shall be based\nupon five representative 24-hour composite samples taken quarterly, at such\nlocations as are adequate to provide proper representation. The schedule of\ncharges for conventional pollutant parameters shall be as follows: SCHEDULE II\nPollutant Parameters Rate\n\nFlow\n$3,274.99\nper million\ngallons\n\nSuspended Solids\n$1.05\nper pound\n\nSoluble Organic Carbon\n$1.81\nper pound\n(ii)\n\nSubstances of concern parameter charges. SIU's, who have wastewater discharge\npermits which limit any substance of concern listed in Schedule III contained\nin this subparagraph, will be billed for discharge of these substances based on\nthe unit rates shown in Schedule III. Discharge loading for billing purposes\nshall be determined by arithmetic average of the last six acceptable\nself-monitoring results. At the option of the SIU, increased self-monitoring\ncan be performed. For billing purposes, when six or more acceptable results are\nobtained over the three month billing period, all such results shall be used in\nthe computation of the arithmetic average, with a requirement that there be at\nleast two sample results for each month. Average discharge loadings will then\nbe multiplied by the corresponding unit rates from Schedule III to obtain total\ncharges per quarter for each substance of concern listed in the SIU's\nwastewater discharge permit. All substances of concern charges will be added to\nthe charges for conventional parameters, as specified in subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph, to compute the total quarterly sewer rate. SCHEDULE III\nSUBSTANCES OF CONCERN UNIT CHARGES\nParameters\n\nUnit Rate\n\nBenzene\n$361.41\nper pound\n\nChloroform\n$64.36\nper pound\n\nDichloroethylenes\n$393.2\n4 per pound\n\nToluene\n$17.43\nper pound\n\nTrichloroethanes\n$81.72\nper pound\n\nTrichloroethylene\n$104.30\nper pound\n\nVinyl Chloride\n$52.21\nper pound\n\nMonochlorotoluenes\n$3.53\nper pound\n\nTetrachloroethylene\n$48.69\nper pound\n\nTotal Phenols\n$7.95\nper pound\n(iii)\n\nBilling. SIU charges shall be billed on a monthly basis by the water board. The\nfirst and second monthly billings in each quarter shall be estimated and shall\nbe one-third of the total billing in the immediately preceding quarter. The\nthird monthly bill in each quarter shall be based upon actual discharge\nquantities for that quarter and shall reflect adjustments for the estimated\nbillings in that quarter. (r) Unless the context specifically indicates\notherwise, all terms contained herein shall have the meanings set forth in the\nregulations adopted by the water board in this Part and Part 1960 of this\n\nTitle, as applicable.
