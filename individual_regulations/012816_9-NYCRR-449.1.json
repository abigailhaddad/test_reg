  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 449.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following terms when used in this Part, unless\notherwise expressly stated, shall be deemed to mean and include: (a) Portable fire extinguishers; classification. (1)\nA class B-1 extinguisher\nshall mean the foam type with a minimum charge of one and one-fourth gallons, the dry chemical type with a minimum charge of two pounds or the carbon dioxide\ntype with a minimum charge of four pounds. (2)\nA class B-2 extinguisher shall mean the\nfoam type with a minimum charge of two and one-half gallons, the dry chemical\ntype with a minimum charge of 10 pounds or the carbon dioxide type with a\nminimum charge of 15 pounds. (b) Fixed fire extinguishing systems. Fixed\nfire extinguishing systems, hereinafter referred to as \"fixed systems\", shall\nmean total flooding systems using carbon dioxide gas as the extinguishing agent\nand having components fixed in position. The operation of the fixed system may\nbe either manual, automatic or a combination of manual and automatic and must\nbe approved by the United States Coast Guard for marine use. Each system shall\nbe of such capacity to provide one pound of CO\n2\ngas for\neach 14 cubic feet of protected area. The inspector shall specify the size of\nthe fixed system re-required [sic], the location of cylinders and components\nand the type of control. Fixed systems shall be required equipment on inboard\nmotor boats and on outboard motor boats which have installed tanks and enclosed\nspaces, when such boats are used for carrying passengers. In cases where the\nconstruction of a vessel or the location of engines and tanks are mainly\nexposed to the open atmosphere, thus making the installation of a fixed system\nimpractical, the inspector may omit the fixed system requirement and add to the\nportable extinguisher requirement, if deemed necessary. (c) Ventilation. Ventilation shall mean the\ninduction of a directed current of air by natural or mechanical means as\nopposed to venting which only provides openings for escape without provision\nfor induction. Induction as used above means the intake of air from the outside\nwhich shall be directed to and through the length of the compartment and then\nreleased outside again. Any compartment or space in which an engine or fuel\ntank is located, particularly the lower portion of bilges, shall be provided\nwith ventilation capable of preventing and effectively removing any\naccumulation of flammable or explosive vapor. (1)\n\nNatural ventilation shall mean\nventilation induced by the installation of permanently open and unobstructed\ninlet and outlet ventilation ducts, extending to bilges, with two ducts serving\nas inlets leading to the wings at one end of the engine compartment and/or fuel\ntank space and two ducts serving as outlets from the wings at the opposite end. The aggregate inlet area and the aggregate outlet area should be proportioned\napproximately to the beam of the boat, with two square inches of aggregate\ninlet or outlet duct area per foot of beam as the minimum. Where engines and/or\nfuel tanks are not in closed compartments, at least one ventilating duct shall\nbe installed in the fore part of the boat and one in the after part. In the\ncase of completely open boat construction using outboard motors and portable\nfuel tanks, no ventilation ducts are required. (2)\n\nMechanical ventilation shall mean\nventilation induced by the installation of a power exhaust blower, in addition\nto the minimum requirement for natural ventilation, the motor of which shall be\ncompletely enclosed and sparkproof and shall be installed outside of ducts and\nas high above the bilge as possible. The exhaust blower shall be of such size\nas to exhaust the total air capacity of the compartment in a period of one\nminute. (d) Life\npreservers. All life preservers used on public vessels shall be of jacket\ndesign, containing pads of buoyant materials consisting of balsa wood, cork, vinyl covered kapok, or vinyl covered fiberous glass inserted in a cloth\ncovering which shall be fitted with straps or ties so that the life preserver\ncan be securely held to the human body. All life preservers manufactured after\n1949 shall be India orange in color, except that white colored life preservers\nwhich have been in continuous use are approved only if in good condition. Re-covering of life preservers is not permitted. In addition, all life\npreservers used on public vessels shall be of the commercial type approved by\nthe United States Coast Guard for use on vessels carrying passengers for hire. Limited United States Coast Guard standards for life vests, buoyant cushions, etc. are not approved. (e) Inboard\nmotor boats. For the purposes of this Part, inboard motor boats shall mean all\nvessels with permanently installed engines and/or fuel tanks using gasoline or\ndiesel oil as a fuel supply, or vessels having enclosed bilge, engine and/or\nfuel tank spaces using gasoline or diesel oil as a fuel supply.
