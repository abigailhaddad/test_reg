  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 227-2.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To the extent\nthat they are not inconsistent with the specific definitions in subdivision (b)\nof this section, the general definitions of Part 200 and Part 201 of this Title\napply. (b) For the purpose of this\n\nSubpart, the following definitions apply: (1)\n\nActual 1990 baseline emissions. An emissions baseline\nestablished from 1990 actual emissions as reported in response to the\ndepartment's survey of major facilities. (2)\n\nForced outage. An\nunplanned component failure that requires the source or major electrical\ninter-tie (345 kV or greater) be removed from service immediately or before the\nnext weekend. Such failures must not include those attributable to improperly\ndesigned equipment, lack of preventive maintenance, careless or improper\noperation, or operator error. (3)\n\nLarge boiler. A boiler with a maximum heat input capacity\ngreater than 100 million Btu per hour and equal to or less than 250 million Btu\nper hour. (4)\n\nMid-size\nboiler. A boiler with a maximum heat input capacity greater than 25\nmillion Btu per hour and equal to or less than 100 million Btu per\nhour. (5)\n\nPeaking\ncombustion turbine. A combustion turbine used intermittently to\nproduce energy during periods of extremely high (\ni.e., peak)\npower demand. (6)\n\nRegenerative combustion turbine. Any combustion turbine which\nrecovers heat from the turbine exhaust gases to preheat combustion\nair. (7)\n\nShutdown. The permanent removal from service of an emission source as evidenced by either\na permit condition or provision prohibiting the emission source from further\noperation, the surrender of the emission source's permit, or the complete\ndeletion of mention of the emission source from the permit of the major\nfacility of which it had formerly been a part with no authorization for\noperation of the emission source appearing in any other permit. (8)\n\nSmall boiler. A boiler\nwith a maximum heat input capacity equal to or greater than one million Btu per\nhour and equal to or less than 25 million Btu per hour. (9)\n\nSmall combustion\nturbine. A combustion turbine with a maximum heat input capacity less\nthan 10 mmBtu per hour. (10)\n\nSmall stationary internal combustion engine. A stationary\ninternal combustion engine with a maximum mechanical output rating of less than\n200 brake horsepower in any severe ozone nonattainment area and less than 400\nbrake horsepower in the remainder of the State. (11)\n\nSystem. As used in the\nterm\nsystem averaging plan, a combination of operating\nemission sources that are located within the same ozone nonattainment area. A\nsystem may consist of multiple emission sources at multiple facilities having\ndifferent owners and/or operators. (12)\n\nTune-up. Adjustments\nmade to a combustion installation in accordance with procedures supplied by the\nmanufacturer (or an approved specialist) to optimize the combustion\nefficiency. (13)\n\nWeighted\naverage permissible emission rate. The average emission rate of all\noperating emission sources in a system averaging plan where the emission rate\nof the emission sources in operation is equivalent to the emission rate\nachieved if each emission source operated in compliance with the most stringent\npermissible emission rate applicable to that emission source.
