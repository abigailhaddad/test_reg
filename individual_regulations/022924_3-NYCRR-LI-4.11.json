  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.11 - Lump-sum payments to retiring employees in lieu of pension\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was asked whether it would be permissible\nunder sections\n250\nand\n400\nof the Banking\n\nLaw for a retiring employee of a savings bank or savings and loan association\nwhich participates in a retirement plan to waive part or all of his annual\npension and accept instead a lump sum equivalent to the amount actuarially\nnecessary to fund the pension waived. The following example illustrates the\nquestion: Assume Employee A is entitled under a plan to an annual\npension of $9,000 at age 65, which amount is equal to 60 percent of average\nfinal three-year earnings preceding retirement of $15,000. Let us assume that\nthe total reserve required at retirement to fund the pension is $100,000. Employee A would like to take $50,000 or half the reserves necessary to fund\nhis benefit in a lump-sum payment at retirement, with the remaining $50,000 to\nbe used to provide him with a life-time benefit of $4,500 per annum. The department in response reiterated its long-standing view\nthat such lump-sum payments are legally impermissible. For, one thing, pension\nplans create a trust in favor of the retired employee. As in any inter vivos\ntrust the legal title is separated from the beneficial interest. Most plans\nspecifically provide that a pensioner's right cannot be assigned. Furthermore, various provisions of the New York State law grant pension rights a more\nprivileged status than is accorded to other forms of deferred compensation. In\nsum, therefore, it would appear likely that sections 250 and 400 were designed\nnot only to prohibit misapplication of the depositor's funds, but also to\nprotect the retired employee by providing for periodic payment of pension\nbenefits. Were this not so, the statute might have provided for severance pay\ninstead. In addition, the department noted that permitting such\npayments could work financial harm on such plans, to the possible detriment of\nemployees entitled to plan benefits after a given employee takes his lump sum. This would result if actuarial assumptions proved to be inaccurate over a\nperiod of time (for instance, if actual longevity of retirees were greater than\nexpected), so that additional funding for the plan or system was needed to\nprovide appropriate pensions. Finally, the department gave weight to the related fact that\nthe single amount actuarially calculated as necessary to fund a given pension\nassumes, for purposes of that particular pension, earnings over the projected\nperiod of retirement at a rate considerably lower (say four percent) than that\nwhich the monies actually earn, with the overage credited to the plan\ngenerally, creating a \"cushion\" designed at least in part to minimize the\nadverse impact of invalid actuarial assumptions. To deprive plans of this\nearnings margin could adversely impact upon benefits later payable to persons\nother than the one having elected and received the lump sum.
