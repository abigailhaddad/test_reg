  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 4.3 - Parties\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Only the\nparties to a proceeding may present evidence and examine and cross-examine\nwitnesses. (b) (1)\n\nParties to a proceeding shall include the\napplicant, petitioner, or complainant, if any; the affected utility company or\ncertificate holder (even if not the applicant or petitioner); trial staff; appearing agencies; and other persons permitted by statute or regulation or by\nthe presiding officer to intervene. (2)\n\nIn cases having numerous parties, the\npresiding officer may promulgate a list of active parties and identify types of\ndocuments that need not be served on parties omitted from that list. Omission\nfrom that list, however, shall not otherwise affect a party's\nstanding. (3)\n\nTo avoid unnecessary\nduplication, the presiding officer may require parties with similar interests\nto consolidate their presentations. (c) (1)\n\nAny\nperson may ask the presiding officer for permission to intervene. Permission\nwill be granted if the intervention is likely to contribute to the development\nof a complete record or is otherwise fair and in the public interest. (2)\n\nPermission to intervene after a hearing\nhas commenced may be sought and granted at any time, unless the presiding\nofficer determines that granting such permission would be unfairly prejudicial\nto other parties. A party intervening after the start of the hearing shall be\nbound by the record as developed to that point and by such conditions of\nintervention as the presiding officer may impose. (d) Staff counsel shall provide the presiding\nofficer and all parties a list of persons designated to serve as trial staff in\nthe case as soon as it is practical to do so and shall promptly report any\nadditions to the list. A person once included on the list may not later be\ndeleted. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n4.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
