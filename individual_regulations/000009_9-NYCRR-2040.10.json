(b) The division shall file a \"Low-Income\n\nHousing Credit Agencies Report of Noncompliance or Building Disposition,\" (the\n\"form\"), and/or provide such other notification as required by the code, with\nthe IRS no later than 45 days after the end of the correction period (as\ndescribed in subdivision [c] of this section, including such extensions of time\ngranted by the division for correction) and no earlier than the end of the\ncorrection period, whether or not the noncompliance or failure to certify is\ncorrected; and shall explain on the form the nature of the noncompliance or\nfailure to certify and indicate whether the owner has corrected the\nnoncompliance or failure to certify. Any change in either the eligible basis or\napplicable fraction under section\n2040.8\n(b)(2)(vii) and\n(viii)\nof this Part respectively, that\nresults in a decrease in the qualified basis of the project under code section\n42(c)(1) is noncompliance that must be reported to the IRS. If the division\nreports on the form that a building is entirely out of compliance and will not\nbe in compliance at any time in the future, the division need not file the form\nin subsequent years to report that building's noncompliance. (The division\nshall file the form with the IRS to report a sale of a project and/or building\nfor which the low-income housing credit is, or has been allowable at any time.)\n\nIf the noncompliance or failure to certify is corrected within three years\nafter the end of a correction period, the division shall file the form with the\nIRS reporting the correction of the noncompliance or failure to\ncertify. (c) The division shall\nprovide the owner a correction period in which to cure a failure to certify or\nevent(s) of noncompliance. The correction period shall not exceed 90 days from\nthe date the division sends a notification of noncompliance. The division may\nextend the correction period for up to six months if, in its sole discretion, the division determines there is good cause for granting the\nextension. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
