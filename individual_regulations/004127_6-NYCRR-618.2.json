  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 618.2 - Lists of actions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThe purpose of this section is to\nsimplify the task of determining whether or not a proposed action may have a\nsignificant effect on the environment by identifying actions or classes of\nactions that are likely to have a significant effect and those which will not\nhave a significant effect. Because of the complex and varied nature of\ndepartment actions, the lists in this section are not all inclusive. The\nomission from the lists of an action does not mean that it is exempt from this\n\nPart, nor does it mean that it is automatically an action requiring\nenvironmental impact statement preparation. The criteria set forth in section\n617.9\nof this Title shall be used to determine significance with respect to actions\nnot listed in this section. The following classification system is used in this\nsection: (2)\n\nType II. Actions or\nclasses of actions which have been determined not to have a significant effect\non the environment and which do not require environmental impact statements\nunder this Part. (b) Lists. (Note: The following list is intended to cover only actions directly\nundertaken by the department consistent with the phased implementation of\narticle 8 of the ECL.)\nTYPE II\nType II actions or classes of actions have been determined by\nthe department not to have a significant effect on the environment and do not\nrequire environmental impact statements, unless the particular action may have\na significant impact on a critical area designated in item (a)(22), Type I, of\nsection\n617.12\nof this Title (6 NYCRR\n617.12\n) or in a geographical area of particular concern\ndesignated pursuant to the State coastal zone management program. No individual\naction shall be considered a Type II action if it would be located in a\nparticularly sensitive environmental area where an otherwise insignificant\nimpact could become significant as determined by the department. The following\nare Type II actions or classes of actions: (a) Class 1. The operation or minor\nalteration of tile following existing structures,buildings, facilities, mechanical equipment or topographical features involving negligible or no\nexpansion of use beyond that previously existing. This class shall also include\nall levels of routine office and clerical activities and the replacement of\nequipment with substantially identical equipment except where less\nenvironmentally harmful equipment of similar performance has become available. This class exemption shall not apply to situations where the section of\nsubstantial quantitites of a source or type of material used in a project may\nhave a significant environmental effect. It shall include, but not be limited\nto, the following department actions: Laboratories. Research stations. Campsites and day-use areas.

Roads, trails and paths, excluding the application of salts\nand other chemicals for snow and ice removal and betterments and safety type\nprojects, where the limits of the project are within the existing right-of-way, including parking lots, bridges, walkways, traffic signals and signs, lights\nand road drainage systems. Dams and docks not involving significant construction\nactivity or any material change in height, hydraulics or operating\nschedules. Streams, stream beds and existing ditches, including the\ncleaning of debris, silt, plant and tree roots and other obstructions from\nstreams and ditches. Aqueducts, levees and diversion facilities. Water supply reservoirs. Water pumping stations, water mains, water meters, water\ntunnels and appurtenances thereto. Water treatment works. Gasoline-powered generating works. Watercourses and water bodies. Sewers and subsurface disposal areas. Sewage treatment works and associated facilities, including\nsewer interceptors, relief mains, outfalls, gatehouses, tidegates and other\ndiversion structures, screens and combined sewer overfall treatment\nfacilities. Interior and exterior alterations involving such things as\ninterior partitions, plumbing and electrical conveyances. Addition of safety or health protection devices for use\nduring construction of or in conjunction with existing structures, facilities\nor mechanical equipment, or topographical features including navigational\ndevices. The operation, alteration or replacement-in-kind of vehicles\nand equipment to be used at or in conjunction with the above items. (b) Class 2. The replacement, restoration, rehabilitation, reconstruction, renovation or demolition (and\nremoval) of a small existing structure or facility, where the structure or\nfacility to be modified or replaced will have substantially the same purpose\nand capacity as that replaced.

It shall include but not be limited to\nthe following: The replacement or reconstruction of existing ditches, ocean\noutfalls, structures, equipment, tools and vehicles used in connection with the\noperation of insect and aquatic weed control programs. (c) Class 3.

This exemption shall include such actions as\nplanting and landscaping to improve the general vegetation quality and similar\nprojects. This exemption shall not include any substantial change in the\nauthorized use for land where such change may have a significant environmental\neffect. It shall include but not be limited to the following: Landscaping, groundkeeping and similar activities that may\nalter or temporarily disturb the surface of land, but which ultimately will\nreturn the land to substantially the same or better condition, such as minor\nsoil grading, seeding, planting, etc. Soil and ground water borings and tests, minor land cuts and\nbrush clearing for survey purposes. The following silvicultural activities shall be considered\n\"minor\": Tree pruning, tree seeding and planting, weeding and releasing, noncommercial thinning, the improvement of cuttings and demonstration plot, the\ncutting of not more than 10 trees per acre in the saw timber class, which class\nshall include softwood trees of 9 inches diameter or more and hardwood trees of\n11 inches diameter or more at breast height.
