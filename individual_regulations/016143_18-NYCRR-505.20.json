  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 505.20 - Alternate care\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Patients who no longer need hospital or skilled nursing facility care shall be\ndischarged promptly and, for hospital patients, shall be discharged in\naccordance with the Department of Health's hospital discharge planning\nrequirements contained in section\n405.22(j)\nof\n\nTitle 10 NYCRR. (b) Facility\nresponsibility. (1)\n\nWhen a patient's condition\nis such that continued care in a hospital or skilled nursing facility is\nnecessary pending placement in an alternate lower medical level of care, continuing payment may be authorized following certification by the patient's\nphysician and a determination of coverability by the Commissioner of Health or\nhis or her other designee, pursuant to Department of Health regulation Part 85\nthat skilled nursing or health-related facility services are medically\nnecessary, are being provided, and are not otherwise available. When medically\nfeasible, nonmedical institutional placement in the community or other\ncommunity placement shall be arranged. (2)\n\nAs soon as the patient's physician has\nindicated need for alternate medical care placement and the anticipated date\nthe patient will be ready for discharge to such care, the hospital or skilled\nnursing facility shall inform the social services district, if required by such\ndistrict, and other agencies that can most appropriately be expected to arrange\nfor the provision of alternate care services, of the patient's medical needs\nthat must be satisfied in accordance with the physician's recommendations. Failure by the hospital or skilled nursing facility to notify the local\ndistrict, if required by such district, or other appropriate agencies prior to\nor within 24 hours of the patient's assignment to alternate care status shall\nresult in denial of payment for care rendered on or after that date. Verbal\nnotification by the hospital or skilled nursing facility shall be promptly\nconfirmed in writing to the local district, if required by the\ndistrict. (3)\n(i) The hospital or skilled nursing facility, through its staff members responsible for discharge planning and, as necessary, in coordination with the responsible local social services district, shall act\npromptly to effect arrangements for alternate care. (ii)\n\nThe hospital or skilled nursing facility\nshall make weekly admission contacts with at least three facilities providing\nthe appropriate level of care in its discharge community, defined as a 50-mile\nradius around the facility. These contacts must be rotated weekly among all\navailable facilities in the referring facility's discharge community. The\ncontacts shall be documented. (iii)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this subparagraph, the hospital or skilled\nnursing facility shall have admission documentation for each patient awaiting\nplacement on file with at least five facilities in its discharge community. A\nskilled nursing facility may restrict the number of facilities having a\npatient's admission documentation on file to fewer than five under the\nconditions set forth in 10 NYCRR Part\n85\ngoverning continuing stay reviews in\nresidential health care facilities. A hospital may restrict the number of\nfacilities having a patient's admission documentation on file to one facility\nwhen there are other hospital patients receiving medical assistance and\nawaiting alternate care placement; and\n(a) the\npatient, within the next 10 days, will either be placed in another facility or\ndischarged to the community; or\n(b) the patient has requested priority for readmission to the medical facility\nwhere the patient resided prior to hospitalization, as provided for under\nsection 360.20 of this Title. (iv)\n\nThe local social services district may\ndirect that a hospitalized patient be placed outside the referring hospital's\ndischarge community when the hospital has been unsuccessful in locating an\nalternate level of care bed within its discharge community within 60 days of\nthe day the patient was placed in alternate care status. A decision to seek\nsuch placement shall be made only when the patient's local professional medical\ndirector: (a) determines that the patient's\nneeds cannot be met by facilities located within the hospital's discharge\ncommunity or that the patient's condition is such that a continued hospital\nstay is medically contraindicated; and\n(b) recommends such placement, based on his\nor her review of available documentation concerning the patient's medical and\npsychosocial needs. (4)\n\nThe hospital or skilled nursing facility\nshall assess the patient's medical condition and alternate medical care\nplacement needs prior to or within 24 hours of the patient's assignment to\nalternate care status. To determine the alternate care level to which the\npatient shall be assigned, the hospital or skilled nursing facility shall apply\neither the patient assessment standards promulgated by the Department of Health\n(DOH) or a DOH-approved equivalent. Each patient assessment shall be reviewed\nand updated periodically during the patient's alternate level of care stay\naccording to the continuing stay review intervals specified by DOH. A copy of\neach such assessment form shall be forwarded to the local district, if required\nby the district. (5)\n\nNo payment for\nhospital or skilled nursing facility care for an eligible person pending\nalternate medical care placement shall be made if: (i) the requirements contained in paragraphs\n(1) through (4) of this subdivision are not met; (ii)\nthe requesting hospital or skilled\nnursing facility has an alternate care facility attached to it or affiliated\nwith it and such an alternate care facility has an appropriate alternate\nmedical care vacancy; (iii)\nan\nappropriate alternate medical care vacancy exists within a 50-mile radius of\nthe requesting facility or beyond this radius for a hospital patient whom the\nlocal social services district has directed the hospital to place beyond the\nhospital's discharge community pursuant to subparagraph (3)(iv) of this\nsubdivision; or\n(iv)\nthe requesting\nhospital or skilled nursing facility has failed to secure other available\nthird-party reimbursement for the care of the patient for that period of time\nthe patient was awaiting alternate care placement. (6)\n\nWhen the utilization review committee\ndetermines that medical assistance payments should be discontinued because the\nrecipient has refused an appropriate alternate care placement, it shall send\nwritten notification of its action to the recipient or the recipient's\nrepresentative or appropriate relative, and the local social services district. The notice shall comply with the requirements of section 360.33 of this Title. The notice and the action taken thereon shall be consistent with Federal and\n\nState utilization review requirements and the recipient shall be notified of\nhis or her right to request a fair hearing as provided for in Part 358 of this\n\nTitle. (7)\n\nMedical assistance\npayments for patients needing alternate care placement shall be available only\nfor patients whose initial admission to the hospital or skilled nursing\nfacility was both medically necessary and appropriate. Medical assistance\npayments for patients needing alternate care placement shall not be available\nfor patients whose initial admission was not both medically necessary and\nappropriate, but was made because an appropriate placement at a lower level of\ncare was unavailable at the time of admission to the referring\nfacility.
