  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 463.8 - Land and land rights\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Land and\nland rights means land owned in fee by the utility, and rights, interests and\nprivileges held by the utility in land owned by others, such as leaseholds, easements, rights-of-way, and other like interests in land. (b) The accounts for land and land rights\nshall include the first cost, including the amounts of mortgages or other liens\nassumed, but not rents payable periodically with respect to such\nrights. (c) When special\nassessments for public improvements provide for deferred payments, the full\namount of the assessments shall be charged to the appropriate land account and\nthe unpaid balance shall be carried in an appropriate liability account. Interest on unpaid balances shall be charged to the appropriate interest\naccount. If any part of the cost of public improvements is included in the\ngeneral tax levy, the amount thereof shall be charged to the appropriate tax\naccount. (d) The net profit from\nthe sale of timber, cord wood, or other property acquired with rights- of-way\nor other lands shall be credited to the appropriate land and land rights\naccount. When land is held for a considerable period of time and timber on the\nland at the time of purchase increases in value, the net profit (after giving\neffect to the cost of the timber) from the sales of timber or its products\nshall be credited to account 526, miscellaneous nonoperating\nrevenues. (e) Separate entries\nshall be made for the acquisition, transfer, or retirement of each parcel of\nland, and each land right, having a life of more than one year. A record shall\nbe maintained showing the nature of ownership, full legal description, area, map reference, purpose for which used, city, county, and tax district in which\nsituated, from whom purchased or to whom sold, payment given or received, other\ncosts, contract date and number, date of recording of deed, book and page of\nrecord. Entries transferring or retiring land or land rights shall refer to the\noriginal entry recording its acquisition. A parcel of land acquired and carried\non the books as a unit, is not required to be subdivided, with transfers to\nother land accounts, merely because of the erection thereon of an incidental\nstructure to be used in steam operations but for a purpose differing from that\nfor which the land is chiefly employed; for example, a small general storehouse\non production plant land. (f) Entries to the steam plant accounts for limited-term interests in land shall\nmake specific reference to the lease, contract or arrangement under which each\ninterest is held or used, together with a concise statement of the terms of the\nlease, contract or arrangement. (g) The cost of buildings and other improvements (except bulkheads, buried, not\nrequiring maintenance or replacement; retaining walls primarily for preserving\nthe level of land; assessments for public improvements, and sidewalks and curbs\nconstructed by the utility on public streets) shall not be included in the land\naccounts. If at the time of acquisition of an interest in land such interest\nextends to buildings or other improvements (other than public improvements), which are then devoted to steam operations, the land and improvements shall be\nseparately appraised and the cost allocated to land and buildings or\nimprovements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements are removed or\nwrecked without being used in steam operations, the cost thereof and the cost\nof removing or wrecking shall be charged and the salvage credited to the\naccount in which the cost of the land is recorded. (h) The cost of land acquired in excess of\nthat used in steam operations shall be included in account 108, Other Utility\n\nPlant, account 110, Other Physical Property, or account 104, Steam Plant Held\nfor Future Use, as appropriate. (i) When the purchase of land for steam operations requires the purchase of land\nnot to be used for such purposes, the charge to the specific land account shall\nbe based upon the cost of the land purchased, less the fair market value of\nthat portion of the land which is not to be used for steam operations. The fair\nmarket value of such land not to be used for steam operations shall be included\nin account 110, Other Physical Property. (j) When the purchase of land for steam\noperations requires the purchase of land not to be used for such purpose, but\nheld for such purpose, the charge to the specific land account shall be based\nupon the cost of only that portion which is used for steam operations, and the\ncost of the remaining land shall be included in account 104, Steam Plant Held\nfor Future Use. (k) The items of\ncost to be included in the accounts for land and land rights are as follows\n(see steam plant instruction §\n463.3\n): (1)\n\nBulkheads, buried, not requiring\nmaintenance or replacement. (2)\n\nCost of acquisition including mortgages and other liens assumed (but not\nsubsequent interest thereon after the property is placed in service). (3)\n\nClearing (first cost) the land of brush, trees and debris; and also tree trimming (first cost) when not chargeable to\nother steam plant accounts. (4)\n\nCondemnation proceedings, including court and counsel costs. (5)\n\nConsents and abutting damages, payment\nfor. (6)\n\nConveyancers' and\nnotaries' fees. (7)\n\nFees, commissions, and salaries to brokers, agents and others in connection with the\nacquisition of the land or land rights. (8)\n\nGrading the land, except when directly\noccasioned by the building of a structure. (9)\n\nLeases, cost of voiding upon purchase to\nsecure possession of land. (10)\n\nRemoving, relocating, or reconstructing property of others, such as buildings, highways, railroads, bridges, cemeteries, churches, telephone and power lines, etc., in order to acquire quiet possession. (11)\n\nRetaining walls when they increase the\nvalue of the land or are primarily to preserve the level of the land. (12)\n\nSpecial assessments levied by public\nauthorities for public improvements on the basis of benefits for new roads, new\nbridges, new sewers, new curbing, new pavements, and other public improvements, but not taxes levied to provide for the maintenance of such\nimprovements. (13)\n\nSurveys in\nconnection with the acquisition. (14)\n\nTaxes assumed, accrued to date of\ntransfer of title. (15)\n\nTitle, examining, clearing, insuring, and registering in connection with the\nacquisition, and defending against claims relating to the period prior to the\nacquisition. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
