Tit. 9 § 48.2 - Conduct of licensed premises\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe proper conduct of on-premises licensed establishments\nis essential to the public interest.

It shall be the\nobligation of each person licensed pursuant to this Part to insure that a high\ndegree of supervision is exercised over the conduct of the licensed\nestablishment at all times in order to safeguard against abuses of the license\nprivilege and violations of law. Each such licensee will be held strictly\naccountable for all violations that occur in the licensed premises and are\ncommitted by or suffered and permitted by any manager, agent or employee of\nsuch licensee. Persons licensed hereunder shall also have a particular\nresponsibility to conform with those provisions of section\n260.20\nof the\n\nPenal Law and sections\n398-c\nand\n399-d\nof\nthe General Business Law, which relate to the admission of minors to premises\nwherein alcoholic beverages are sold.
