Tit. 14 § 816.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) These\nregulations set forth minimum standards for the provision of withdrawal and\nstabilization services for persons suffering from acute or crisis stages of\nsubstance use disorder. (b) The\nprimary function of a withdrawal and stabilization service is the medical\nmanagement and treatment of acute withdrawal, resulting in a referral to an\nappropriate level of care. Certified providers of withdrawal and stabilization\nservices may provide one or more of the following services as further defined\nin this Part: (1)\nmedically managed\nwithdrawal and stabilization services; (2)\nmedically supervised inpatient withdrawal\nand stabilization services; and/or\n(3)\nmedically supervised outpatient\nwithdrawal and stabilization services. (c) Withdrawal and stabilization services can\nbe the first step in the recovery process and must be provided in an atmosphere\nwhich protects the patient's dignity. Therefore, it is expected that providers\nof withdrawal and stabilization services will establish meaningful linkages for\nsupporting services, including appointments for admission, linkages to\nsupportive services and those services identified by use of an Office\ndesignated level of care determination tool for the appropriate level of care. All services shall be provided in a manner that is person centered, strength\nbased and trauma informed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
