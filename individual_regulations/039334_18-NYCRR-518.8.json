  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 518.8 - Recovery of overpayments pending a hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The department may, upon notice to the\nprovider and not sooner than 20 days after issuance of the final audit report\nor notice of agency action, commence recoupment of overpayments. (b) If a request for hearing has been timely\nmade and the department's office of administrative hearings is unable to\nschedule the hearing so that it is commenced within 90 days of receipt of such\nrequest or if the department is unable to proceed within 90 days of receipt of\nsuch request, any recovery begun under this section will be stayed pending the\ncommencement of the hearing. If a hearing has been scheduled to commence within\n90 days of receipt of a hearing request, any delays or adjournments of the\ncommencement of the hearing occasioned by or attributable to the provider, his\nor her attorney or authorized representative will not forestall the\ncommencement or continuation of recoupment. However, any delays or adjournments\noccasioned by or attributable to the department will forestall the commencement\nor continuation of recoupment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n518.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
