(b) Field-installed cathodic protection\nsystems were designed by a corrosion expert. (c) impressed current systems were designed\nto allow determination of current operating status as required under paragraph\n2.2(i)(3) of this Subpart. (iii)\n\nCategory 3 tank\nrequirements. Category 3 tanks must be properly designed, constructed, and secondarily contained, and any portion in contact with the ground and\nroutinely contains petroleum must be protected from corrosion, in accordance\nwith subparagraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. Tanks may also be designed and\nconstructed in accordance with one of the following codes of practice (refer to\nsection\n1.10\nof this Part for complete\ncitation of references), in lieu of the codes of practice listed under clause\n(b)(1)(iii)(\na\n), subclause\n(b)(1)(iii)(\nb\n)(\n1\n), or subclause\n(b)(1)(iii)(c)(1) of this section: (a) DoD UFC\n3-460-01, 2018; or\n(b) a code of\npractice developed by a nationally recognized association or independent\ntesting laboratory and approved by the\n\nDepartment.
