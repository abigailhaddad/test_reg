  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2524.3 - Proceedings for eviction-wrongful acts of tenant\n\nState Regulations\n\nWithout the approval of the DHCR, an action or proceeding\nto recover possession of any housing accommodation may only be commenced after\nservice of the notice required by section\n2524.2\nof this Part, upon one or\nmore of the following grounds, wherein wrongful acts of the tenant are\nestablished as follows: (a) The tenant\nis violating a substantial obligation of his or her tenancy other than the\nobligation to surrender possession of such housing accommodation, and has\nfailed to cure such violation after written notice by the owner that the\nviolations cease within 10 days; or the tenant has willfully violated such an\nobligation inflicting serious and substantial injury upon the owner within the\nthree-month period immediately prior to the commencement of the proceeding. If\nthe written notice by the owner that the violations cease within 10 days is\nserved by mail, then five additional days, because of service by mail, shall be\nadded, for a total of 15 days, before an action or proceeding to recover\npossession may be commenced after service of the notice required by section\n2524.2\nof this Part. (b) The tenant is committing or permitting a\nnuisance in such housing accommodation or the building containing such housing\naccommodation; or is maliciously, or by reason of gross negligence, substantially damaging the housing accommodation; or the tenant engages in a\npersistent and continuing course of conduct evidencing an unwarrantable, unreasonable or unlawful use of the property to the annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort or damage of others, the primary purpose of which is intended to\nharass the owner or other tenants or occupants of the same or an adjacent\nbuilding or structure by interfering substantially with their comfort or\nsafety. The lawful exercise by a tenant of any rights pursuant to any law or\nregulation relating to occupancy of a housing accommodation, including the RSL\nor this Code, shall not be deemed an act of harassment or other ground for\neviction pursuant to this subdivision. (c) Occupancy of the housing accommodation by\nthe tenant is illegal because of the requirements of law and the owner is\nsubject to civil or criminal penalties therefor, or such occupancy is in\nviolation of contracts with governmental agencies. (d) The tenant is using or permitting such\nhousing accommodation to be used for immoral or illegal purpose. (e) The tenant has unreasonably refused the\nowner access to the housing accommodation for the purpose of making necessary\nrepairs or improvements required by law or authorized by the DHCR, or for the\npurpose of inspection or showing the housing accommodation to a prospective\npurchaser, mortgagee or prospective mortgagee, or other person having a\nlegitimate interest therein; provided, however, that in the latter event such\nrefusal shall not be a ground for removal or eviction unless the tenant shall\nhave been given at least five days' notice of the inspection or showing, to be\narranged at the mutual convenience of the tenant and owner so as to enable the\ntenant to be present at the inspection or showing, and that such inspection or\nshowing of the housing accommodation is not contrary to the provisions of the\ntenant's lease or rental agreement. If the notice of inspection or showing is\nserved by mail, then the tenant shall be allowed five additional days to\ncomply, for a total of 10 days because of service by mail, before such tenant's\nrefusal to allow the owner access shall become a ground for removal or\neviction. (f) The tenant has\nrefused, following notice pursuant to section\n2523.5\nof this Title, to renew an\nexpiring lease in the manner prescribed in such notice at the legal regulated\nrent authorized under this Code and the RSL, and otherwise upon the same terms\nand conditions as the expiring lease. This subdivision does not apply to\npermanent hotel tenants, nor may a proceeding be commenced based on this ground\nprior to the expiration of the existing lease term. (g) For housing accommodations in hotels, the\ntenant has refused, after at least 20 days' written notice, and an additional\nfive days if the written notice is served by mail, to move to a substantially\nsimilar housing accommodation in the same building at the same legal regulated\nrent where there is a rehabilitation as set forth in section\n2524.5\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Part, provided: (1)\nthat the owner has an\napproved plan to reconstruct, renovate or improve said housing accommodation or\nthe building in which it is located; (2)\nthat the move is reasonably necessary to\npermit such reconstruction, renovation or improvement; (3)\nthat the owner moves the tenant's\nbelongings to the other housing accommodation at the owner's cost and expense; and\n(4)\nthat the owner offers the\ntenant the right of reoccupancy of the reconstructed, renovated or improved\nhousing accommodation at the same legal regulated rent unless such rent is\notherwise provided for pursuant to section\n2524.5\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Part. (h) In the\nevent of a sublet, an owner may terminate the tenancy of the tenant if the\ntenant is found to have violated the provisions of section\n2525.6\nof this Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
