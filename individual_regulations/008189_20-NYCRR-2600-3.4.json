  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 2600-3.4 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Reckless\nconduct. Reckless conduct is a highly unreasonable action, omission or\nmisrepresentation involving an extreme departure from the standards of ordinary\ncare that a tax return preparer should observe under the circumstances. A\npattern of conduct is a factor that will be taken into account in determining\nwhether a preparer acted knowingly, recklessly, or through gross\nincompetence. (b) Gross\nincompetence. Gross incompetence includes conduct that reflects gross\nindifference, tax return preparation or tax practice that is grossly inadequate\nunder the circumstances, or a consistent failure to perform obligations to the\nclient. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n2600-3.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
