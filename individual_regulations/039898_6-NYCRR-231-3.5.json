Tit. 6 §§ 231-3.5 - Source obligation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nissuance of a permit does not relieve any owner or operator of the\nresponsibility to comply fully with applicable provisions of the State\n\nImplementation Plan. (b) For the\npurposes of Subparts 231-7 and 231-8 of this Part only, at such time that a\nparticular facility becomes a major facility or a modification becomes a NSR\nmajor modification solely by virtue of a relaxation in any enforceable\nlimitation which was established after August 7, 1980, on the capacity of the\nfacility or modification otherwise to emit a regulated NSR contaminant, such as\na restriction on hours of operation, then the requirements of Subparts 231-7\nand 231-8 of this Part, as applicable, apply to the facility as though\nconstruction had not yet commenced on the facility. (c) Any owner or operator of a facility that\nproposes a project that involves a physical change or change in the method of\noperation that the owner or operator determines would be followed by a facility\nemissions increase that exceeds baseline actual emissions and that equals or\nexceeds any of the significant project thresholds in Subpart 231-13 of this\n\nPart, table 3, 4 or 6, must notify the department in writing of the proposed\nproject prior to implementing the change if the owner or operator determines\nthat the project does not constitute a modification because all the emission\nincreases are attributable to independent factors in accordance with section\n231-4.1\n(b)(42)(i)\n('c') of this Part. The notification shall include the following: (1)\na description of the change; (2)\nthe calculation of the projected\nemissions increase; (3)\nthe\nproposed date of the change; and\n(4)\nan explanation of the factual basis for the conclusion that none of the\nprojected emission increases are attributable to the proposed\nproject.
