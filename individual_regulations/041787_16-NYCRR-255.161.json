  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.161 - Supports and anchors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\npipeline and its associated equipment must have enough anchorage or support to: (1)\nprevent undesigned-for strain on\nconnected equipment; (2)\nresist\nlongitudinal forces caused by a bend or offset in the pipe; and\n(3)\nprevent or damp out excessive\nvibration. (b) Each\nexposed pipeline must have enough support or anchorage to protect the exposed\npipe joints from the maximum end force caused by internal pressure and any\nadditional forces caused by temperature expansion or contraction or by the\nweight of the pipe and its contents. (c) Each support or anchor on an exposed\npipeline must be made of durable, non-combustible material and must be designed\nand installed in compliance with the following: (1)\n\nFree expansion and contraction of the\npipeline between supports or anchors may not be restricted. (2)\n\nProvision must be made for the service\nconditions involved. (3)\n\nMovement\nof the pipeline may not cause disengagement of the support equipment. (d) Each support on an exposed\npipeline operated at a stress level of 50 percent or more of SMYS must comply\nwith the following: (1)\nA structural support\nmay not be welded directly to the pipe. (2)\n\nThe support must be provided by a member\nthat completely encircles the pipe. (3)\n\nIf an encircling member is welded to a\npipe, the weld must be continuous and cover the entire circumference. (e) Each underground pipeline that\nis connected to an unyielding line or other fixed object must have enough\nflexibility to provide for possible movement, or it must have an anchor that\nwill limit the movement of the pipeline. (f) Each underground pipeline that is being\nconnected to new branches must have a firm foundation for both the header and\nthe branch to prevent lateral and vertical movement. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.161\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
