Tit. 22 §§ 130-1.1 - Costs; sanctions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The court, in its discretion, may\naward to any party or attorney in any civil action or proceeding before the\ncourt, except where prohibited by law, costs in the form of reimbursement for\nactual expenses reasonably incurred and reasonable attorney's fees, resulting\nfrom frivolous conduct as defined in this Part. In addition to or in lieu of\nawarding costs, the court, in its discretion may impose financial sanctions\nupon any party or attorney in a civil action or proceeding who engages in\nfrivolous conduct as defined in this Part, which shall be payable as provided\nin section\n130-1.3\nof this Subpart. This Part\nshall not apply to town or village courts, to proceedings in a small claims\npart of any court, or to proceedings in the Family Court commenced under\narticle 3, 7 or 8 of the Family Court Act. (b) The court, as appropriate, may make\nsuch award of costs or impose such financial sanctions against either an\nattorney or a party to the litigation or against both. Where the award or\nsanction is against an attorney, it may be against the attorney personally or\nupon a partnership, firm, corporation, government agency, prosecutor's office, legal aid society or public defender's office with which the attorney is\nassociated and that has appeared as attorney of record. The award or sanctions\nmay be imposed upon any attorney appearing in the action or upon a partnership, firm or corporation with which the attorney is associated. (c) For purposes of this Part, conduct is frivolous if: (1)\nit\nis completely without merit in law and cannot be supported by a reasonable\nargument for an extension, modification or reversal of existing law; (2)\nit is undertaken primarily\nto delay or prolong the resolution of the litigation, or to harass or\nmaliciously injure another; or\n(3)\nit asserts material factual\nstatements that are false. Frivolous conduct shall include the\nmaking of a frivolous motion for costs or sanctions under this section. In\ndetermining whether the conduct undertaken was frivolous, the court shall\nconsider, among other issues the circumstances under which the conduct took\nplace, including the time available for investigating the legal or factual\nbasis of the conduct, and whether or not the conduct was continued when its\nlack of legal or factual basis was apparent, should have been apparent, or was\nbrought to the attention of counsel or the party. (d) An award of costs or the\nimposition of sanctions may be made either upon motion in compliance with CPLR\n2214 or 2215 or upon the court's own initiative, after a reasonable opportunity\nto be heard. The form of the hearing shall depend upon the nature of the\nconduct and the circumstances of the case. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
