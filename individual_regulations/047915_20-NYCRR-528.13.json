  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 528.13 - Machinery and equipment used in production; telephone and telegraph equipment; parts, tools and supplies\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1115(a)(12)\n(a) Exemption. (1)\n\nExemption from statewide tax. An\nexemption is allowed from the tax imposed under subdivisions (a) and (c) of\nsection\n1105\nof the Tax Law, and from the\ncompensating use tax imposed under section\n1110\nof the Tax Law, for receipts from\nsales of the following: (i) Machinery or\nequipment (including parts with a useful life of more than one year) used or\nconsumed directly and predominantly in the production for sale of tangible\npersonal property, gas, electricity, refrigeration or steam, by manufacturing, processing, generating, assembling, refining, mining or extracting. (This\nexemption includes all pipe, pipeline, drilling rigs, service rigs, vehicles\nand associated equipment used in the drilling, production and operation of oil, gas and solution-mining activities to the point of sale to the first commercial\npurchaser.)\n(ii)\n\nTelephone central\noffice equipment or station apparatus or comparable telegraph equipment\n(including parts with a useful life of more than one year) for use directly and\npredominantly in receiving at destination or in initiating and switching\ntelephone or telegraph communication when such equipment or apparatus is\npurchased or leased by the vendor of such service for sale. (iii)\n(a) Parts with a useful life of one year or less, tools or supplies for use or\nconsumption directly and predominantly in the production of tangible personal\nproperty, gas, electricity, refrigeration or steam for sale by manufacturing, processing, generating, assembling, refining, mining or extracting. (b) Parts with a useful life of one year or\nless, tools or suppliers for use directly and predominantly in or on the\nequipment or apparatus described in subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph. (iv)\n\nThe\nservices of installing, repairing, maintaining or servicing the exempt\nmachinery, equipment, apparatus, parts, tools or supplies identified in\nsubparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph. (2)\n\nExemption from taxes imposed by\nlocalities other than New York City. (i) There\nis an exemption from all local sales and use taxes, other than the taxes\nimposed in New York City, for all sales and uses of: (a) tangible personal property used or\nconsumed directly and predominantly in the production for sale of tangible\npersonal property, gas, electricity, refrigeration or steam by manufacturing, processing, generating, assembling, refining, mining or extracting; and\n(b) telephone central office\nequipment, station apparatus or comparable telegraph equipment for use directly\nand predominantly in receiving at destination or in initiating and switching\ntelephone or telegraph communication when such equipment or apparatus is\npurchased or leased by the vendor of such service for sale. Parts, tools or\nsupplies for use directly and predominantly in or on such equipment or\napparatus are also eligible for this exemption, when purchased or leased by the\nvendor of such service for sale. (See clause [3][i][\nb\n] of this\nsubdivision for the more limited exemption from tax on telephone central office\nequipment, etc. available in New York City.)\n(ii)\n\nThere is no exemption from the sales and\nuse taxes imposed by localities on the sale of the services of installing, repairing, maintaining or servicing any of the exempt tangible personal\nproperty identified in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. However, a charge\nfor the installation of tangible personal property which becomes a capital\nimprovement to real property is not subject to tax. (3)\n\nExemption from New York City local tax. (i) There is an exemption from the sales and\nuse tax imposed in New York City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law for sales and uses of\nthe following: (a) Machinery or equipment, including parts with a useful life of more than one year, used or consumed\ndirectly and predominantly in the production for sale of tangible personal\nproperty, gas, electricity, refrigeration or steam by manufacturing, processing, generating, assembling, refining, mining or extracting. (This\nexemption includes all pipe, pipeline, drilling rigs, service rigs, vehicles\nand associated equipment used in the drilling, production and operation of oil, gas and solution mining activities to the point of sale to the first commercial\npurchaser.)\n(b) Telephone central\noffice equipment, station apparatus or comparable telegraph equipment, including parts with a useful life of more than one year, for use directly and\npredominantly in receiving at destination or in initiating and switching\ntelephone or telegraph communication where such equipment or apparatus is\npurchased or leased by the vendor of such service for sale. (ii)\n\nThere is no exemption from\nthe sales and use tax imposed in New York City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law for sales or uses of: (a) parts with a useful life of one year or\nless or tools or supplies used in connection with the exempt machinery, equipment or apparatus described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph; or\n(b) the services of installing, repairing, maintaining or servicing any of the exempt machinery, equipment, apparatus, parts, tools or supplies described in this paragraph. However, a\ncharge for the installation of machinery, equipment or apparatus which becomes\na capital improvement to real property is not subject to tax. (4)\n\nAn exempt use\ncertificate is used to claim the exemptions from the State and local sales\ntaxes described in this subdivision. (See section\n532.4\n[e]\nof this Title.)\n\nCross-reference: Exclusion for tangible personal property which becomes an\ningredient or a component part of a product produced for sale; see section\n526.6\n(c) of this Title. (b) Production. (1)\n\nThe activities listed in paragraph (a)(1)\nof this section are classified as administration, production or distribution. (i) Administration\nincludes\nactivities such as sales promotion, general office work, credit and collection, purchasing, maintenance, transporting, receiving and testing of raw materials\nand clerical work in production such as preparation of work, production and\ntime records. (ii)\n\nProduction\nincludes the production line of the plant starting\nwith the handling and storage of raw materials at the plant site and continuing\nthrough the last step of production where the product is finished and packaged\nfor sale. (iii)\n\nDistribution\nincludes all operations subsequent to production, such as storing, displaying, selling, loading and shipping finished\nproducts. (2)\n\nThe\nexemption applies only to machinery and equipment used directly and\npredominantly in the production phase. Machinery and equipment partly used in\nthe administration and distribution phases does not qualify for the exemption, unless it is used directly and predominantly in the production phase. (3)\n\nThe determination of when production\nbegins is dependent upon the procedure used in a plant. If on receiving raw\nmaterials, the purchaser weighs, inspects, measures or tests the material prior\nto placement into storage, production begins with placement into storage, and\nthe prior activities are administrative. If the materials are unloaded and\nplaced in storage for production without such activities, the unloading is the\nbeginning of production. Example 1: A crane is used to unload raw materials, which are\nimmediately placed in storage at a plant. From the storage site, the material\nis placed on an assembly line without testing. The crane is being used in\nproduction. Example 2: Testing equipment used to test incoming materials is not\nused in production and is subject to tax. (4)\n\nProduction ends when the product is ready\nto be sold. Example 3: A food processor sells canned food in cases of 48 cans. The\ncanned food is stacked for later labeling and casing. The line of production is\ndeemed to extend through the labeling and casing operation. (c) Directly and\npredominantly. (1)\n\nDirectly\nmeans the machinery or equipment must, during the\nproduction phase of a process: (i) act upon or\neffect a change in material to form the product to be sold, or\n(ii)\nhave an active causal relationship in\nthe production of the product to be sold, or\n(iii)\nbe used in the handling, storage, or\nconveyance of materials or the product to be sold, or\n(iv)\nbe used to place the product to be sold\nin the package in which it will enter the stream of commerce. (2)\n\nUsage in activities collateral\nto the actual production process is not deemed to be used directly in\nproduction. Example 1: Plating racks, used during the process of electroplating\nproducts for sale are deemed to be equipment used directly in the production of\ntangible personal property. Example 2: A private water company purchases pumps, chlorinators, valves, aerators, motors, and motor controls to be used in the processing of\nwater for sale. Such machinery and equipment is used directly in the production\nof water. Example 3: A manufacturing plant has two boilers which generate steam\ncarried by piping systems through two turbines. One turbine produces electric\npower which is sold to a power company. The other turbine provides mechanical\npower to drive the production machinery. The steam is then used in other phases\nof the manufacturing process, converted to water by condensation and returned\nto the boilers. The boilers, piping systems and condenser are all machinery and\nequipment used directly in the production of tangible personal property and\nelectricity for sale. Example 4: Commercial fishing vessels are deemed to be machinery or\nequipment used directly in the production of tangible personal property for\nsale by extraction. Example 5: Tongs and dredges used to dig up shellfish and mops and\ndrills used to catch predators are equipment used to produce tangible personal\nproperty for sale by extraction. Example 6: Machines to grind meat, make hamburg patties, cube steaks, or slice meat; power saws and scales when used by slaughterhouses, wholesale\nmeat houses and supermarkets, are used directly in processing tangible personal\nproperty for sale, and are exempt. However, similar machinery and equipment\nused by restaurants in the preparation of food and drink taxed under section\n1105 (d)\nof the Tax Law, are taxable as they are not used in the processing of tangible personal\nproperty for sale. Example 7: Trucks which are required to be registered with the\n\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles used to transport raw materials from a pit to a\nprocessing plant over a public road are not used directly in production. Example 8: A fork lift is used only in conveying material from one\nassembly line to another assembly line in a plant. The fork lift is used\ndirectly in production. (3)\n\nMachinery used to produce other machinery or equipment or parts for self use in\nproduction is considered to be used directly in production. Example 9: A manufacturer purchases a machine which is used to\nconstruct molds, having a useful life in excess of one year which form the\nproducts being manufactured for sale. The machine is used directly in\nproduction. Example 10: A manufacturer uses a lathe in a machine shop to make new\nmachinery which is used to produce tangible personal property for sale. The\nlathe is used directly in production. (4)\n\nMachinery or equipment is used\npredominantly in production, if over 50 percent of its use is directly in the\nproduction phase of a process. Example 11: A fork lift is used 60 percent of the time on an assembly\nline and 40 percent of the time for loading finished products onto railroad\ncars for delivery. The fork lift is used predominantly in production. Example 12: An overhead crane is located near the end of an assembly\nline. It is used to carry materials along the assembly line and also to load\nfinished products onto railroad cars for shipment to customers. Forty percent\nof the time it is used for assembly line operations and 60 percent of the time\nfor the loading of the finished products. The crane is taxable as it is not\npredominantly used in the production phase of the operation. Example 13: A company purchases a machine to produce new paper machine\nrolls and to recondition old paper machine rolls for its customers. The machine\nis to be used for production 70 percent of the time and for reconditioning 30\npercent of the time. Reconditioning is a repair service to tangible personal\nproperty, and machinery used for that purpose is not in production. However, as\nthe machine in this example will be used directly in production over 50 percent\nof the time, it qualifies for exemption. (5)\n\nMachinery or equipment used in production\nby someone other than its owner is exempt under the same conditions as other\nmachinery and equipment. Example 14: A manufacturer of tangible personal property containing\nsome plastic parts contracts with a plastic manufacturer to produce the plastic\nparts for it by an injection molding process. The plastic manufacturer requires\nthe customer to provide it with the necessary molds, which have a useful life\nin excess of one year. The purchase of the molds by the customer before use\nwill be exempt, provided they are used directly and predominantly in\nmanufacturing, even though the use is by someone other than the\nowner. (d) Waste treatment equipment. (1)\n\nMachinery and equipment used for disposing of industrial waste, as a part of a\nprocess for preventing water or air pollution, will be considered as being used\ndirectly and predominantly in production by manufacturing, processing, generating, assembling, refining, mining or extracting, if\n(i) the machinery and equipment is purchased\nby a manufacturer and used predominantly to actually treat, bury, or store\nwaste materials from a production process, and\n(ii)\nover 50 percent of the waste treated, buried or stored results from the production process. Example 1: A manufacturing plant has a pumping station to transmit\neffluent from an industrial process to a municipal sewage treatment system. The\nequipment at the pumping station is exempt. Example 2: A manufacturing plant has a treatment plant at which it\ntreats effluent from an industrial process and sanitary waste. Eighty percent\nof the waste treated is industrial effluent. The equipment at the treatment\nplant is exempt as it is used directly and predominantly in production. Example 3: A company uses cloth filter dust collectors to collect dust\nfrom the grinding of material for sale. The air is treated by being passed\nthrough a special cloth which acts as a filter, and collects the particles. The\nequipment for dust collection is used directly in manufacturing and is\nexempt. Example 4: A company uses a scrubber and ventilation system which\nplaces a gaseous mixture, generated in a manufacturing process, in contact with\nwater. This converts the gaseous chemicals into a dilute solution. The scrubber\nand ventilation system is machinery or equipment used directly in production, as it treats industrial waste, and purchase thereof is exempt from tax. Example 5: Equipment used to contain oil spillage or recover oil\nspillage is not considered to be in the treatment of waste from industrial\nprocess. (2)\n\nBuilding materials, which become part of a capital improvement used as a waste\ntreatment facility are not eligible for the exemption. Example 6: A company builds a concrete waste treatment center that has\nequipment to treat effluent from a manufacturing process. The concrete building\nand tanks are real property and are not machinery and equipment. They are not\nexempt although the machinery and equipment contained therein may be\nexempt. Example 7: A company increases the height of a smokestack as part of\nits pollution control program. The materials used to construct the smokestack\nare not machinery or equipment but are additions to real property and are not\nexempt although equipment contained therein may qualify for the\nexemption. (e) Parts, tools and supplies. (1)\n\nThe term\npart\nmeans a replacement for any portion of a machine\nor piece of equipment, and any device actually attached to the machinery or\nequipment and used in connection with the performance of its function. A part\ncannot accomplish the work for which it was designed independent of the machine\nfor which it is intended to be a component. Example 1: A replacement blade for a bench saw used in production has\na useful life of six months. Such blade is a part which is exempt from State\nand local taxes except for the taxes imposed in New York City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. Example 2: A buttonhole attachment for a sewing machine used in\nproduction has a useful life of 18 months. Such attachment is a part which is\nexempt from State and local taxes including the taxes imposed in New York City\nunder section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. Example 3: A compressor motor used for production painting is replaced\nafter the machine has been in operation for six months. The normal useful life\nof this type of motor is two years. This replacement motor is exempt from State\nand local taxes including the taxes imposed in New York City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. Example 4: A manufacturer uses molds to form products being\nmanufactured for sale. The molds are inserted and attached to injection-molding\nmachines, into which a plastic is injected under heat and pressure; the plastic\nis then ejected from the mold as a finished product. The useful life of the\nmold is in excess of one year. The molds are parts, which qualify for exemption\nfrom State and local taxes including the taxes imposed in New York City under\nsection\n1107\nof the Tax Law. Example 5: Fourdrinier wires, felt blankets and dryer felts, used with\npaper-making machines, which have a useful life of 10 to 100 days, are parts\nwhich are exempt from State and local taxes except for the taxes imposed in New\n\nYork City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. (2)\n\nThe term\ntool\nmeans a\nmanually operated implement for performing a task. Example 6: A hand saw and a hand drill used by a furniture maker for\nproducing a table for sale are tools exempt from State and local taxes except\nfor the taxes imposed in New York City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. Example 7: A power saw and an electric drill used by a furniture maker\nfor producing a table for sale are machinery and equipment exempt from State\nand local taxes including the taxes imposed in New York City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. Example 8: A manufacturer purchases wrenches that are used to tighten\nfittings on machines used directly and predominantly in the production of\ntangible personal property for sale. As tools used directly and predominantly\nin the production of tangible personal property for sale, the wrenches are\nexempt from State and local taxes except for the taxes imposed in New York City\nunder section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. (3)\n\nThe term\nsupply\nmeans an\nitem of tangible personal property used in the maintenance of machinery or\nequipment and an item of tangible personal property used or consumed in\nproduction, whose use is incidental to such production, or which is expendable. Example 9: Oil, grease or coolant used for the efficient operation of\nmachines that are used directly and predominantly in the production of tangible\npersonal property for sale are supplies exempt for State and local taxes except\nfor the taxes imposed in New York City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. Example 10: Charts used in instruments that record and control the flow\nof materials through the manufacturing process are supplies exempt from State\nand local taxes except for the taxes imposed in New York City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. Example 11: Garnet paper used in connection with sanding machines to\nsmooth furniture before finishing is a supply exempt from State and local taxes\nexcept for the taxes imposed in New York City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. Example 12: A paper pattern used by a dressmaker in producing dressing\nfor sale is a supply exempt from State and local taxes except for the taxes\nimposed in New York City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. Example 13: Safety apparel, safety shoes and eye shields used directly\nand predominantly in production are supplies exempt from State and local taxes\nexcept for the taxes imposed in New York City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. Example 14: Sand used to form molds in a foundry's casting operation is\na supply exempt from State and local taxes except for the taxes imposed in New\n\nYork City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law. (f) Telephone and telegraph\nequipment. (1)\n\nTelephone and telegraph\ncentral office equipment or station apparatus, used directly and predominantly\nin receiving at destination or initiating and switching telephone and telegraph\ncommunication is exempt, when such equipment and apparatus is purchased or\nleased by the vendor of such service for sale. (2)\n\nThe purchase or lease of equipment by a\nperson subscribing to a telephone or telegraph service, which is comparable to\ntelephone or telegraph central office equipment or station apparatus is not\neligible for exemption. Example 1: A telephone company purchases switchboards and handsets for\ninstallation at a subscriber's premises. Such purchases are exempt. Example 2: An airline company purchases consoles which initiate, receive and switch telephone calls which are sent over telephone company lines. The consoles are not exempt, as they were not purchased by a telephone company\nin connection with a telephone service for sale. (3)\n\nThe exemption does not apply to other\nequipment used in conjunction with telephone and telegraph communication, such\nas testing equipment. Example 3: A telephone company purchases devices which are installed\non relay racks and are used to test two-way trunk transmission level. These\ndevices are not exempt as they neither initiate, receive or switch\ncommunication. Example 4: A telephone company purchases electronic scanning devices\nwhich are used in the central office to measure conversation holding times for\nthe purposes of diagnosing trouble conditions and developing equipment\nrequirements. These devices are not exempt as they do not initiate, receive or\nswitch communication. (4)\n\nThe provisions of subdivision (e) of this section apply to parts, tools and\nsupplies used with central office equipment and station apparatus. (5)\n\nThe exemption provided by this\nsubdivision does not apply to equipment used to provide cable television\nservice or music service, since those services are not telephony or telegraphy. Cross reference: Telephony or telegraphy defined, see section\n527.2\n(d) of this Title; for exclusion of cable television and music services from the\nmeaning of telephony and telegraphy, see paragraph (d)(3) of section\n527.2\nof this Title.
