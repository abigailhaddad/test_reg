  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 600.8 - Criteria for determining the operation of diagnostic or treatment center under article 28 of the public health law\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any provision of medical or health\nservices by a provider of medical or health services organized as a\nnot-for-profit or business corporation other than professional service\ncorporation shall constitute the operation of a diagnostic or treatment\ncenter. (b) It shall be prima facie\nevidence that a diagnostic or treatment center is being operated when any\nprovider of medical or health services describes itself to the public as a\n\"center,\" \"clinic\" or by any name other than the name of one or more of the\npractitioners providing these services. (c) A provider of medical or health services\nthat does not come within subdivision (a) or (b) of this section shall be\nreviewed by the Commissioner of Health to determine whether medical or health\nservices are being provided by practitioners of medicine engaged in private\npractice or by facility within article 28 of the Public Health Law. The\nfollowing criteria shall be used in conducting such reviews: (1)\n\nPatient contact. Patient contact is made\ndirectly with the facility rather than the individual physician; or referral is\nmade to the facility by the physician; or provision is made for services by the\nphysician, not in his offices but at another location. (2)\n\nAdmission. The decisions as to admissions\nare made by the facility rather than by the individual practitioner, or by\nreferral agreement or by arrangements with physicians. (3)\n\nChoice of physician. When the physician\nis not chosen by the patient, the physician is assigned by the facility, or the\npatient is given a choice among several practitioners associated with or\nemployed by the facility. (4)\n\nCare\nof patients. Care that is provided patients is the responsibility of the\nfacility and is provided under the following conditions, among others: (i) the facility, rather than the physician\nassumes responsibility for all services rendered within the facility; (ii)\ncentral services, including but not\nlimited to laboratory, pharmacy, X-ray and narcotics are available with no free\nchoice of the provider of such services by the patient; (iii)\nthe facility insures adherence to\nstandards; (iv)\nthe facility is\norganized into departments or has a multi-disciplined approach; (v) the facility supplies ancillary services; or\n(vi)\nthe responsibility of the\nfacility terminates on discharge of the patient, as distinguished from the\ncontinuing responsibility of the physician; follow-up care is not provided by\nor at the facility. (5)\n\nOrganization and management. (i) Bills and\ncharges are determined by the facility; (ii)\nmedical charts and patient records are\nmaintained by the faculty; (iii)\npatient care space is provided by the facility; (iv)\nincome distribution is determined by the\nfacility; (v) employees are\nselected as supervised by the facility; (vi)\nvital records such as fetal death\ncertificates, etc. are maintained by the facility; (vii)\nbills are payable to the facility, rather than to the individual practitioner; (viii)\nthe scope of the services to be\nprovided is determined by the facility, subject to regulatory\nlimitations; (ix)\nthe structure is\nso physically extensive that it exceeds the usual space requirements of the\nprivate medical practitioner; (x) the departmental organization is large enough to require delegation of\nauthority to nonmedical personnel; (xi)\nthere is employment of other health\nprofessions such as registered nurse, physical therapist, pharmacist; or\n(xii)\nthe patient registry is\nmore extensive than that found in the usual individual practice. Many more\npersons are processed than are ordinarily diagnosed or treated by physicians in\nthe private practice of medicine. (d) The criteria set forth in subdivision (c)\nof this section shall not be the sole determining factors, but indicators to be\nconsidered with such other factors that may be pertinent in particular\ninstances. Professional expertise is to be exercised in the utilization of the\ncriteria. Establishment shall be required where a determination is made that\nmedical services are being provided by a facility within article 28 of the\n\nPublic Health Law rather than by a private practitioner of medicine. All of the\nlisted indicia of a facility within article 28 of the Public Health Law need\nnot be present in a given instance. The criteria are intended to assist in\ndetermining the dominant features of the services offered. (e) In addition to the foregoing, any\nfacility which qualifies for an agreement to participate in the Medicare\nprogram as an ambulatory surgical center shall constitute a diagnostic and\ntreatment center. The conditions of participation in the Medicare program as an\nambulatory surgical center are contained in volume 42 of the Code of Federal\n\nRegulations, Public Health, at part 416 ( 42 CFR part\n416\n), 1984 edition, published by the Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records\n\nService, General Services Administration. Copies may be obtained from the\n\nSuperintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC\n20402. 42 CFR part\n416\nis available for public inspection and copying at the\n\nRecords Access Office, New York State Department of Health, 10th Floor, Corning\n\nTower Building, Empire State Plaza, Albany, NY 12237. (f) The Department of Health may conduct such\nhearings as may be necessary to gather sufficient facts to make a determination\nunder this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
