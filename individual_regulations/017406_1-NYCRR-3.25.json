  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 3.25 - High-temperature-short-time, (htst), continuous-flow pasteurization-item 16p(a)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Indicating\nthermometers and recorder/controller instruments. All indicating thermometers\nand recorder/controller instruments and devices used in connection with the\nhigh-temperature-short-time, continuous-flow pasteurization of milk, milk\nproducts, whey, condensed milk products and condensed whey shall comply with\nthe applicable specifications set forth in Appendix 9 of this Title. (b) Automatic milk controller. Each\nhigh-temperature-short-time, continuous-flow pasteurization system shall be\nequipped with an automatic milk flow control of the diversion type which\ncomplies with the following: (1)\n\nAutomatic\nmilk flow controls. The term automatic milk flow controls shall mean those\nsafety devices which control the flow of product in relation to the temperature\nof the product, heating medium, pressure, vacuum or other auxiliary equipment. Milk flow cntrols shall not be considered a part of the temperature control\nequipment. Milk flow controls shall be of the flow-diversion type which\nautomatically cause the diversion of subtemperature product. Flow-diversion\ndevices shall return the subtemperature product to the raw product side of the\nheating system continuously until proper pasteurization temperatures are\nobtained, at which time the device shall restore forward product flow through\nth pasteurizer. (2)\n\nFlow-diversion\ndevices. Flow-diversion devices used in continuous pasteurizers shall comply\nwith the following: (i) Forward flow of\nsubtemperature product due to the omission or looseness of the connecting clip\nshall be prevented by making the valve and its actuating mechanism integral, or, where there is a connecting device, by making it impossible to assemble the\nvalve and its actuating mechanism except in such manner that it will function\nproperly, or, where there is a connecting device which may be omitted or shaken\nloose, by providing for pushing, instead of pulling, the valve to the diverted\nposition; or by providing that the pump will shut down when the product is\nbelow the pasteruization temperature and the valve is not in the fully diverted\nposition, or by other satisfactory means. (ii)\nA packing gland, used to prevent leakage\naround the actuating stem, shall be constructed so as to prevent tightening of\nthe stem packing nut to such an extent as to prevent the valve from assuming\nthe fully diverted position. (iii)\nA leak escape shall be installed on the forward-flow side of the valve seat. However, when back pressure is exerted on the forward-flow side of the valve\nseat while the product flow is being diverted, the leak escape should lie\nbetween two valve seats or between two portions of the same seat, one upstream\nand the other downstream from the leak escape. The leak escape shall be\ndesigned and installed to discharge all leakage to the outside or to the\nconstant-level tank through a line separate from the diversion line, provided\nthat, when leakage is discharged to the constant-level tank, a sight glass\nshall be installed in the leak escape line to provide visual means of leak\ndetection. (iv)\n\nThe closure of the\nforward-flow seat shall be sufficiently tight so that leakage past it will not\nexceed the capacity of the leak escape device, as evidenced when the\nforward-flow line is disconnected. The length of the connecting rod shall not\nbe adjustable by the user. (v) The\nflow-diversion device shall be designed and installed so that failure of the\nprimary motivating power shall automatically divert the flow of\nproduct. (vi)\n\nThe flow-diversion\ndevice shall be located downstream from the holder. The flow-control sensor\nshall be located in the product line not more than 18 inches upstream from the\nflow-control device. (vii)\n\nThe\npipeline from the diversion port of the flow-diversion device shall be\nself-draining and shall be free of restrictions or valves, unless such\nrestrictions or valves are designed so that stoppage of the diversion line\ncannot occur. (viii)\n\nThe pipeline\nfrom the leak detector part of the flow-diversion device shall be self-draining\nand shall be free of restrictions or valves, unless such restrictions or valves\nare designed so that stoppage of the leak detector line cannot occur. (3)\n\nMilk flow controller\ninstrumentation. Instrumentation of the milk flow controller shall comply with\nthe following: (i) The thermal limit\ncontroller shall be set and sealed so that forward flow of product cannot start\nunless the termperature at the controller sensor is above the required\npasteurization temperature, as defined in section\n3.2\n(k) of this\n\nPart, for the milk, milk product, whey, condensed whey and the process used. The thermal unit controller shall be set and sealed so that forward flow of\nproduct cannot continue during descending temperatures when the product\ntemperature is below the required pasteurization temperature. The thermal limit\ncontroller shall be sealed by the regulatory agency after testing, and the seal\nshall not be removed without immediately notifying the regulatory agency. The\nsystem shall be designed so that no product can bypass the controller sensor. The controller sensor shall not be removed from its proper position during the\npasteurization process. The cut-in and cut-out product temperatures, as shown\nby the indicating thermometer, shall be determined at the beginning of each\nday's operation and entered upon the recorder chart daily by the plant\noperator. (ii)\n\nManual switches for\nthe control of pumps, homogenizers or other devices which produce flow through\nthe holder shall be wired so that the circuit is completed only when the\nproduct is above the required pasteurization temperature, as defined in section\n3.2\n(k) of this\n\nPart, for the milk, milk product, whey, condensed milk products and condensed\nwhey and the process used, or when the diversion device is in the fully\ndiverted position. (4)\n\nHolding tube. (i) Holders shall be designed\nto provide for the holding of every particle of product for at least the time\nrequired in section\n3.2\n(k) of this\n\nPart for the milk, milk product, whey, condensed milk products and condensed\nwhey and the process used. (ii)\n\nThe\nholder shall be so designed that the simultaneous temperature difference\nbetween the hottest and coldest product in any cross-section of flow at any\ntime during the holding period will not be greater than one degree Fahrenheit\n(one-half degree Celsius). Tubular holders, seven inches in diameter or\nsmaller, which are free of fittings may satisfy this requirement without\ntest. (iii)\n\nNo device shall be\npermitted for short-circuiting a portion of the holder to compensate for\nchanges in rate of product flow. Holding tubes shall be installed so that\nsections of pipe cannot be left out (thus resulting in a shortened holding\ntime). (iv)\n\nThe holding tube shall\nbe arranged to have a continuous upward slope in the direction of flow of not\nless than 0.25 inch per foot. (v) Tube supports shall be provided to maintain all parts of holding tubes in a\nfixed position, free from any lateral or vertical movement. (vi)\n\nThe holder shall be designed so that no\nportion between the inlet and the flow-control temperature sensor is\nheated. (5)\n\nIndicating\nand recording thermometers. (i) An indicating\nthermometer shall be located as near as practicable to the temperature sensor\nof the recorder/controller. (ii)\n\nThe termperature shown by the recorder/controller shall be checked daily by the\nplant operator against the temperature shown by the indicating thermometer. Readings shall be recorded on the chart. The recorder/controller shall be\nadjusted to read no higher than the indicating thermometer. (iii)\n\nThe recorder/controller charts shall\ncomply with the applicable provisions of section\n3.27\nof this Part (Item\n16p[C]). (6)\n\nFlow-promoting devices. (i) The pump, or\npumps, and other equipment which may produce flow through the holder shall be\nlocated upstream from the holder, provided that pumps and other flow-promoting\ndevices may be located downstream from the holder if means are provided to\neliminate negative pressure between the holder and the inlet to such equipment. When vacuum equipment is located downstream from the holder, an effective\nvacuum breaker and an automatic means of preventing a negative pressure in the\nline between the flow-diversion device and the vacuum chamber shall be\nacceptable. (ii)\n\nThe speed of pumps\nor other flow-promoting devices governing the rate of flow through the holder\nshall be controlled so as to insure the holding of every particle of product\nfor at least the time required, as defined in section\n3.2\n(k) of this\n\nPart, for the product and the process used. The pump motor shall be connected\nto the metering pump by a common drive shaft, or by gears and pulleys, or by a\nvariable-speed drive, with the gear box, the pulley box, or the setting of the\nvariable speed protected in such a manner that the holding time cannot be\nshortened without detection by the regulatory agency. Pumps shall be sealed\nafter tests by the regulatory agency and such seal shall not be broken without\nimmediately notifying the regulatory agency. This provision shall apply to all\nhomogenizers used as timing pumps. Variable-speed drives used in connection\nwith the metering pump shall be constructed so that wearing or stretching of\nthe belt results in a slowdown, rather than a speedup, of the pump. The\nmetering or timing pump shall be of the positive displacement type. (iii)\n\nThe holding time shall be taken to mean\nthe flow time of the fastest particle of product, at or above the required\npasteurization temperature, as defined in section\n3.2\n(k) of this\n\nPart, for the product and the process used, throughout the holder section. The\nholder section is that portion of the system that is outside of the influence\nof the heating medium which slopes continuously upward in the downstream\ndirection and is located upstream from the flow-diversion device. Tests for\nholding time shall be made when all equipment and devices are operated and\nadjusted to provide for maximum flow. When a homogenizer is located upstream\nfrom the holder, the holding time shall be determined with the homogenizer in\noperation with no pressure on the homogenizer valves. Where bypass lines are\nprovided, either upstream or downstream from the metering pump, the holding\ntime shall be tested with both the regular and bypass line open unless the\nbypass valve is so designed that both lines cannot be open at the same time. The holding time shall be tested during both forward and diverted flow. If\nnecessary to lengthen the holding time during diverted flow, an identifiable\nrestriction may be placed in the vertical portion of the diversion pipeline. When vacuum equipment is located downstream from the holder, the holding time\nshall be tested with the metering pump operating at maximum flow, and the\nvacuum equipment adjusted to provide for the maximum vacuum. The holding time\nshall be tested in both forward and diverted flow by the regulatory agency\ninitially and quarterly thereafter. After any alteration or replacement that\nmay affect the holding time, and whenever the seal of the speed setting has\nbeen broken, the holding time shall be tested by the regulatory\nagency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n3.25\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
