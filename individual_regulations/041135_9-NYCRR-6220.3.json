  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6220.3 - Cyber Security Program Requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A cyber security program shall have the\nfollowing elements: (1)\n\nData Classification\n(i) Each Board of Elections shall conduct a\ndata classification exercise to: identify Board of Elections data assets and\ninformation systems; determine the criticality of data assets and information\nsystems; determine the order and scope of data assets required to be backed up\nbased on the criticality derived from the data classification exercise; and\ndetermine the priority to restore data based on the criticality derived from\nthe data classification exercise. (ii)\n\nEach Board of Elections shall conduct\nsuch data classification exercise for each new information system that creates, modifies, stores, or transmits election data. (iii)\n\nThe data classification exercise must\nbe initiated in the first year of this regulation and must be completed no\nlater than August 1\nst\nprior to the general election\neach year; however, if a new information system is created subsequent to August\n1\nst, but prior to election day, a new data\nclassification exercise must be conducted as soon as practicable. (2)\n\nAsset Inventory\n(i) Each Board of Elections shall maintain an\nasset inventory of all devices and software that access, store, process, and\ntransmit election data. At a minimum, the Board shall review said inventory for\naccuracy on a monthly basis. (ii)\n\nAt a minimum, the inventory shall include: network address(es), machine\nname(s), purpose of each device, whether the device is portable, and an asset\nowner responsible for each device. Mobile devices that handle election data\nmust be included whether or not they connect to the Board of Elections network. (iii)\n\nEach Board of Elections\nshall deploy a network-based asset discovery tool to build an initial asset\ninventory of Board of Elections systems, both hardware and software. The\nnetwork-based asset discovery tool must be run on a monthly basis to discover\nnew assets on the Board of Elections network segment and update the asset\ninventory. Any non-approved or unknown devices or software should be\ndocumented, investigated, and removed. (3)\n\nPatch Management\n(i) Each Board of Elections shall ensure all\ninformation systems and electronic equipment, other than voting systems, that\naccess, store, process, and transmit election data are up-to-date through the\nuse of a monthly patching program.
