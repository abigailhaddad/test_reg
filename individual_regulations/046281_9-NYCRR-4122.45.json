  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4122.45 - Super exotic pools\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe rules in this section shall govern all super exotic\npari-mutuel pools conducted by a licensed harness track operator. (a) Wagering tickets. A super exotic\npari-mutuel pool known as the \"pick-seven,\" \"pick-eight,\" \"pick-nine,\"\n\"pick-ten\" or such other name as may be approved by the commission, is\nauthorized to be conducted by a harness track operator upon the outcome of 7, 8, 9 or 10 consecutive pari-mutuel races to be contested at such operator's\ntrack on the same racing program. Such pool shall be separate and distinct from\nall other pari-mutuel pools conducted at such track. Wagers in such pool shall\nbe represented by pari-mutuel tickets immediately distinguishable from\npari-mutuel tickets issued in other pools. A wager, that shall select a winner\nfor each designated race, shall be included on the same pari-mutuel ticket, that shall be issued prior to the start of the first designated super exotic\nrace. Races designated for the super exotic pool shall be clearly described as\nsuch in the official program. (b) Winners and carry-overs. In general, after deductions for cancellations, refunds and statutory take-out, the resulting super exotic net pool shall be\ndistributed, less breaks, to the holders of tickets selecting winners of all\ndesignated races in the pool. Should there be no wager selecting winners of all\ndesignated races, then, at the option of the track operator, established before\nthe first such pool of the meeting is conducted, a stated percentage of not\nless than 25 percent nor more than 75 percent of the net pool shall be\ndistributed, less breaks, to the holders of tickets selecting the winners of\nthe most super exotic races and the balance of the net pool shall be carried\nover and added to and distributed with the net pool of the next subsequent\nsuper exotic pool in which a wager correctly selects the winners of all\ndesignated super exotic races. The number of races designated for the super\nexotic pool shall not be changed during a meeting until a wager has correctly\nselected the winner of every designated race of a super exotic pool or until\nthere has been an intermediate distribution. (c) Added payments to winners. In addition to\nthe net pool and any carry-overs distributable when a wager correctly selects\nwinners of all designated races of a super exotic pool, there shall be\ndistributed by the track operator from its own funds, upon such occurrence, any\namounts it has advertised that it will add to the total distribution, or any\namounts necessary to yield an advertised guaranteed total\ndistribution. (d) Intermediate\ndistributions. Prior to the last two weeks of a licensed race meeting, a date\nand program approved by the commission may be announced by the track operator\nwhen (provided no one thereafter has correctly selected the winners of all\ndesignated races of a super exotic pool through such program) accumulated\ncarry-overs in an amount announced by the track operator will be added to the\nestablished percentage of the net pool distributable to wagers selecting the\nwinners of the most races of the super exotic pool conducted on such program. The balance of undistributed carry-overs above such announced amount, plus any\ncarry-over from such program, shall in turn carry-over for distribution with\nsubsequent super exotic pools conducted by such track operator. An intermediate\ndistribution may also be directed at any time, upon three days' notice by the\ncommission, of such portion or all of the accumulated carry-over money as may\nbe directed by the commission. (e) Final distribution. The commission shall select a date and program during the\nfinal week of the licensed race meeting of a track operator when there shall be\na final distribution of all accumulated carry-overs together with the entire\nnet pool of the super exotic pool conducted during such program to the holders\nof wagers selecting the winners of the most super exotic races contested during\nsuch program. Thereafter no super exotic pools will be conducted at such\nmeeting. In the event that all super exotic races on the program designated for\nfinal distribution are cancelled, and no further programs are conducted at the\nmeeting, the commission shall require that a super exotic pool be conducted on\nthe first program of the next subsequent race meeting conducted at such track\nby such track operator to provide for final distribution for such prior\nmeeting. The commission may also order a final distribution for an earlier time\nin the commission's discretion. (f) Dead heats. Each horse in a dead heat for win shall be considered the winner, and no allocations among wagers shall be made as a result thereof, unlike the\npractice in a pari-mutuel win pool. The payoff price per dollar shall be the\nsame for all winning wagers. (g) Scratched horses and nonstarters. At any time after wagering begins on the pool\nshould an entire betting entry or field be scratched or declared a nonstarter\nin any super exotic race, no further tickets selecting such betting entry or\nfield shall be issued, and wagers upon such betting entry or field, for\npurposes of the super exotic pool, shall be deemed wagers upon the betting\nentry or field upon which the most wagers have been registered in the win pool\nat the track at the close of win pool betting for such race (designated horse). (In the event of a money tie, the tied betting entry or field with the lowest\nprogram number shall be designated.) Wagers remaining in the pool upon horses\nthat may have been scratched will, in the case of multiple betting entries or\nfields be deemed wagers upon the horses remaining in such entries or fields, and in the case of single betting entries be deemed wagers upon the designated\nhorse in the race affected by the scratch. Should the balance of a betting\nentry or field race as a nonbetting starter for purposes of other pari-mutuel\npools, as provided in section\n4122.27\nof this Part, wagers upon\nsuch entry or field shall be deemed wagers upon the designated horse for such\nrace. Should a programmed starter be scratched or declared a nonstarter prior\nto the start of the first leg, the betting operator shall be authorized to\nrefund any tickets designating betting entries affected thereby prior to such\nfirst leg. (h) Race cancellations. Except for pools in which an intermediate or final distribution is to be made, should one or more super exotic races be cancelled, no carry-overs from prior\nsuper exotic pools, advertised guaranteed amounts nor advertised added amounts\nwill be distributed to winners in such super exotic pool and that program's\nentire net pool only shall be distributed, less breaks, to holders of wagers\nupon the winners of all super exotic races contested for such pool. Should no\nwager select the winners of all super exotic races contested, the established\npercentage of that net pool shall be distributed, less breaks, to the holders\nof wagers upon the winners of the most super exotic races contested and the\nbalance shall be carried over as elsewhere provided in this section, for\nsubsequent distribution. (i) Seed\nmoney or insurance allocation. Two percent of the total super exotic pool shall\nbe held apart by the track operator from the take-out of each super exotic pool\nto reimburse such track operator for the cost of any insurance it may secure to\nguarantee minimum distributions to winners of such pools, or to reimburse a\ntrack operator for funds it expends for added money or guaranteed minimum\ndistributions to winners of such pools. Any accumulation of such two percent\nallocations not necessary to reimburse a track for expenditures actually\nincurred for such purposes shall be added to the amounts distributable in the\npool designated for final distribution for the year. (j) Posting of winning combinations. Every\nwagering combination entitled to a payoff shall be posted publicly by the track\noperator together with the payoff price therefor. (k) Trust funds. Carry-over monies shall be\nheld in a separate account in trust by track operators for the benefit of\nparticipants in super exotic pools until distributed. (l) No reduction in guaranteed distributions. Added monies or guaranteed minimum distributions advertised by a track operator\nshall not be reduced for subsequent super exotic pools until a wager correctly\nselects winners of all designated races of a super exotic pool, or a final\ndistribution occurs, whichever is first. Advertised added monies or minimum\ndistributions shall not apply to intermediate or final distributions unless a\nwager correctly selects winners of all designated races of the super exotic. A\nguaranteed minimum distribution or guaranteed added money amount, once\nadvertised, may not be reduced and shall continue to be guaranteed by the track\noperator for every super exotic pool for the balance of the meeting. (m) Betting information. Unless otherwise\nordered by the commission, information concerning combinations wagered upon or\nnot wagered upon in a super exotic pool shall not be disclosed by the tote\noperator or otherwise, until all races of a super exotic pool have been\ncontested and declared official. The operation of the totalisator equipment and\nreports generated thereby as well as the communication of any information\nconcerning such pool shall be subject to the strict supervision of the\ncommission. (n) Nontransferability. Super exotic tickets shall be nontransferable and violations of this\nsubdivision may lead to confiscation and cancellation of such tickets in\naddition to other disciplinary action. (o) Unforeseen circumstances. Should\ncircumstances occur that are not foreseen in this section, questions arising\nthereby shall be resolved in accordance with general pari-mutuel practice in\nthe judgment of the presiding judge. Decisions regarding distribution of super\nexotic pools are final and unappealable. (p) Posting of rules. These rules shall be\nposted in the public area of the track by the track operator and copies thereof\nshall be made available to the public by the track operator. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
