  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 65-3.13 - Sources of additional personal injury protection benefits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Institution of claims-priority. Generally, an applicant's initial source of additional personal injury protection benefits will be the same source which provides the mandatory personal injury protection benefits, until the total available limits under that source's mandatory and additional personal injury protection coverages are exhausted. Specifically: (1)\n\nAn applicant who is an operator or occupant of an insured motor vehicle covered for additional personal injury protection benefits, and who sustains a personal injury arising out of the use or operation in New York State of such motor vehicle, shall institute the claim against the insurer of such motor vehicle. (2)\n\nAn applicant who is a named insured or a relative of a named insured covered by additional personal injury protection benefits, and who, while an operator or occupant of a motor vehicle, sustains a personal injury arising out of the use or operation of such motor vehicle outside of New York State, shall institute the claim against the insurer of the named insured or the relative. Where there is more than one insurer which would be the source of benefits, the first such insurer applied to shall process the claim, unless the insurers agree among themselves that another such insurer will accept and pay the claim initially. (See subdivision [b] of this section.) If the insurers do not reach an agreement, then each insurer that concludes it was not the first insurer contacted to provide first party benefits shall issue a denial of claim form (NF-10) that includes the following statement in box 33: If, after contacting the insurer that we advised you has primary responsibility for the payment of first party benefits, that insurer denies coverage for your claim, you have the option to submit this dispute for expedited arbitration by providing a copy of the denial form and a written request along with a $40 filing fee to the organization listed under option two on the back of this form. Your $40 filing fee will be refunded to you by the insurer determined to be responsible for processing your claim. This arbitration is limited solely to determining the insurer to process your claim, and it will not resolve issues regarding pending bills or consider any other defense to payment. You do not need to submit bills for this arbitration. (3)\n\nAn applicant who is a named insured or a relative of a named insured covered for additional personal injury protection benefits, and who is neither an operator nor an occupant of a motor vehicle or a motorcycle, and who sustains a personal injury through the use or operation of a motor vehicle or a motorcycle shall institute the claim against the insurer of the named insured or the relative. Where there is more than one insurer which would be the source of benefits, the first such insurer applied to shall process the claim, unless the insurers agree among themselves that another such insurer will accept and pay the claim initially. (See subdivision [b] of this section.) If the insurers do not reach an agreement, then each insurer that concludes it was not the first insurer contacted to provide first party benefits shall issue a denial of claim form (NF-10) that includes the following statement in box 33: If, after contacting the insurer that we advised you has primary responsibility for the payment of first party benefits, that insurer denies coverage for your claim, you have the option to submit this dispute for expedited arbitration by providing a copy of the denial form and a written request along with a $40 filing fee to the organization listed under option two on the back of this form. Your $40 filing fee will be refunded to you by the insurer determined to be responsible for processing your claim. This arbitration is limited solely to determining the insurer to process your claim, and it will not resolve issues regarding pending bills or consider any other defense to payment. You do not need to submit bills for this arbitration. (4)\n\nAn applicant who is not a named insured or a relative of a named insured covered for additional personal injury protection benefits, and who is an occupant of an insured motor vehicle covered for additional personal injury protection benefits or a motor vehicle operated by a person covered for additional personal injury protection benefits, and who sustains a personal injury through the use or operation of the insured motor vehicle outside of New York State, shall institute the claim against the insurer of the owner or operator of the insured motor vehicle. Where there is more than one insurer which would be the source of benefits, the first such insurer applied to shall process the claim unless the insurers agree among themselves that another such insurer will accept and pay the claim initially. (See subdivision [b] of this section.) If the insurers do not reach an agreement, then each insurer that concludes it was not the first insurer contacted to provide first party benefits shall issue a denial of claim form (NF-10) that includes the following statement in box 33: If, after contacting the insurer that we advised you has primary responsibility for the payment of first party benefits, that insurer denies coverage for your claim, you have the option to submit this dispute for expedited arbitration by providing a copy of the denial form and a written request along with a $40 filing fee to the organization listed under option two on the back of this form.

This arbitration is limited solely to determining the insurer to process your claim, and it will not resolve issues regarding pending bills or consider any other defense to payment. You do not need to submit bills for this arbitration. (5)\n\nAn applicant who has exhausted the additional personal injury protection benefits available under the initial sources as set forth in this section, shall then apply for benefits from the next available source providing a higher level of additional personal injury protection benefits. This latter source shall provide benefits to the extent that the total limit available under such latter source exceeds the amount available under the initial sources as set forth in this section. This process will repeat until all available additional personal injury protection benefit sources have been exhausted. (6)\n\nIf a dispute arises among insurers who are liable for the payment of additional personal injury protection benefits and have the same priority of payment, then the first insurer to whom notice of claim is given pursuant to section\n65-3.3\nor\n65-3.4\n(a) of this Subpart, by or on behalf of an eligible injured person, shall be responsible for payment to such person. Any such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the arbitration procedures established pursuant to section\n5105\nof the Insurance Law and section\n65-4.11\nof this Part. Each insurer that concludes that it was not the first insurer contacted to provide additional personal injury protection benefits shall issue a denial of claim form (NF-10) that includes the following statement in box 33: If, after contacting the insurer that we advised you has primary responsibility for the payment of additional personal injury protection benefits, that insurer denies coverage for your claim, you have the option to submit this dispute for expedited arbitration by providing a copy of the denial form and a written request along with a $40 filing fee to the organization listed under option two on the back of this form. Your $40 filing fee will be refunded to you by the insurer determined to be responsible for processing your claim. This arbitration is limited solely to determining the insurer to process your claim, and it will not resolve issues regarding pending bills or consider any other defense to payment. You do not need to submit bills for this arbitration. (b) Any insurer paying additional personal injury protection benefits as provided in this section shall be reimbursed by the other insurers for their proportionate share of the costs of the claim and the allocated expenses of processing the claim, in accordance with the other coverage; nonduplication paragraph of the additional personal injury protection endorsement contained in section\n65-1.3\nof this Part. (c) For the purposes of this section, \"insurer of such motor vehicle\" means any insurer that is providing additional personal injury protection benefits at the time the personal injury is sustained.
