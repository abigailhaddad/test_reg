  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4011.23 - WIN-3\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When consistent\nwith the public interest and the best interests of racing generally, the\ncommission may approve a request from a track operator to offer \"WIN-3\" betting\nas a service to the betting public. Other names for such bets may be approved\nby the commission. (b) The \"WIN-3\"\nis a unique pari-mutuel pool, separate from all other pari- mutuel pools. The\nobject of the WIN-3 is to select the winners only of three consecutive races\n(legs) designated by the track operator and advertised clearly in the betting\nprogram. (c) Winning payoff price. From the gross pool is deducted the take-out and consolation payoff amounts, if\nany, and the resulting balance, divided by the amount wagered on the winning\ncombination, less breaks, shall determine the payoff per dollar on winning\nbets. (d) Dead heat winners. If\nthere are two or more winning combinations because of a dead heat in one or\nmore legs there shall be a separate payoff price per dollar calculated for each\nwinning combination as follows: from the gross pool is deducted the take-out, consolation payoff amounts, if any, and amounts wagered on all winning\ncombinations; the balance shall be divided by the number of different winning\ncombinations upon which bets were sold, each resulting allocated part being\nassigned to each respective winning combination; an allocated part plus the\namounts bet on each winning combination when divided by the amount bet on such\nwinning combination (less breaks) shall be the resulting payoff per dollar per\nrespective winning combination. (e) Failure to select a winning combination. (1)\n\nPatrons shall be advised by public address to hold all WIN-3 tickets and the\ncircumstances leading to such announcement: after the first leg if no bet\nselects a winner of the first leg; after the second leg if no bet combines the\nwinners of the first two legs; and after the third leg if no bet combines all\nthree winners. (2)\n\nShould there be\nno bets on any winning combination, then all bets combining two winners shall\nbe considered winning bets and paid a price per dollar bet calculated as with\ndead heat winning combinations. Consolation tickets combining such two winners\nshall be entitled to a winning payoff in addition to a consolation\npayoff. (3)\n\nShould there be no bets\ncombining winners of two legs, then all bets selecting a winner shall be\nconsidered winning bets and paid a price per dollar bet calculated as with\nwinning dead heat combinations. Consolation tickets shall be entitled to a\nwinning payoff in addition to a consolation payoff. (4)\n\nShould there be no bets on any winner, the WIN-3 shall be declared off and the entire pool refunded. (f) Race cancellations. (1)\n\nIf any leg is cancelled or declared\nnon-betting before the start of the first leg, the pool shall be\nrefunded. (2)\n\nIf either the second\nor third leg (or both) are cancelled or declared non-betting after the start of\nthe first leg, payoffs will be determined on the basis of contested\nlegs. (g) Scratches and\nconsolations. (1)\n\nRefunds. In the event a\nbetting entry is scratched (which hereinafter includes being declared a\nnon-starter or a non-betting starter) from any leg of the WIN-3 prior to the\nstart of the first leg, all bets containing such scratched betting entry shall\nbe refunded to determine the gross pool and removed from further consideration\nin the pool. Coupled entries and fields are only considered \"scratched\" for\npurposes of this section in accordance with the provisions of section\n4009.20\nof this Title. (2)\n\nConsolations. (i) In the event a betting entry is scratched\nin the second leg after the start of the first leg a consolation payoff shall\nbe computed for those bets combining the winners of the first and third legs\nwith such scratched horse as follows: from the gross pool shall be deducted the\nstatutory take-out and then the amount represented by bets on combinations\ninvolving entries scratched from the third leg (reduced by the rate of\nstatutory take-out thereon). The resulting remainder shall be divided by the\namounts bet on the combination of such first and third leg winners with all\nbetting entries in the second leg (less breaks) to determine the consolation\nprice per dollar payable to those bets combining winners of the first and third\nlegs with an entry scratched in the second leg. The break shall not be deducted\nfrom the pool. (ii)\n\nIn the event a\nbetting entry is scratched in the third leg after the start of the first leg, a\nconsolation payoff shall be computed for those bets combining the winners of\nthe first and second legs with such scratched horse as follows: from the gross\npool shall be deducted the statutory take-out and then the amount represented\nby bets on combinations involving entries scratched from the second leg\n(reduced by the rate of statutory take-out thereon). The resulting remainder\nshall be divided by the amount bet on the combination of such first and second\nleg winners with all betting entries in the third leg (less breaks) to\ndetermine the consolation price per dollar payable to those bets combining\nwinners of the first and second legs with an entry scratched in the third leg. The breaks shall not be deducted from the pool. (iii)\n\nIn the event betting entries are\nscratched in both the second and third legs after the start of the first leg, a\nconsolation payoff shall be computed for those bets combining the winner of the\nfirst leg with entries scratched in both the second and third legs as follows: From the gross pool shall be deducted the take-out and the remainder shall be\ndivided by the amount bet on the winner of the first leg combined with all\nother entries (less breaks) to determine the consolation price per dollar\npayable to those tickets combining the winner of the first leg with entries\nscratched from both the second and third legs. The breaks shall not be deducted\nfrom the pool. (iv)\n\nDead heat\ncomputations for consolation payoffs shall be consistent with the principles in\nsubdivision (d) of this section as applied to remainders for payoff as\ndetermined in this subdivision. (h) This rule shall be prominently displayed\nthroughout the betting area of the track and printed copies shall be made\navailable by the track to patrons upon request. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
