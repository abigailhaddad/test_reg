  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 204.7 - Facility operating and siting requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Public health. Every\nnatural organic reduction facility must at all times follow accepted policies\nand procedures with respect to infection control, including standard\nprecautions developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and New\n\nYork State Department of Health. (b) Processing time. The\nmaximum processing time, from acceptance of the remains to distribution of the\nnaturally organically reduced remains, is nine months. The division may approve\na longer processing time for good cause, such as additional time necessary to\nsatisfy the requirements of section\n204.8\nof this Part. (c) Method of reduction. The\nnatural organic reduction facility must maintain the remains under aerobic\nconditions during the composting process to convert them to naturally\norganically reduced remains. Methods of natural organic reduction that result\nin a mature humus product must be followed. (d) Run-off prevention. The\nnatural organic reduction facility must be constructed to prevent any ponding\nor discharge, prevent waste and leachate from being discharged into sewers, surface waters or groundwater; and must be operated in a manner that minimizes\nthe generation of leachate and that does not drain, dump or discharge\nleachate. (e) Siting\nrequirements. The natural organic reduction facility must be at least\n200 feet from the nearest: surface water body such as lakes, rivers, and\nstreams, potable water well, state-regulated wetland, residence, or place of\nbusiness other than the cemetery itself. These minimum distance requirements\nmay be reduced if means acceptable to the division are used to reduce the\npotential for odor transmission and accidental leachate run-off. (f) Odor prevention. The\nnatural organic reduction facility must not produce odors that unreasonably\nimpact sensitive receptors, such as residences, schools, or nursing homes, as\ndetermined by the division. The division can require additional action to\naddress odor issues. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
