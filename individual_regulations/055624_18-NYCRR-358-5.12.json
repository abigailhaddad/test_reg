Tit. 18 §§ 358-5.12 - Telephone Hearings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) OAH may provide that a fair hearing held\npursuant to Part 398 of this Title be conducted by means of telephone. When a\nhearing is conducted by telephone, the parties and the hearing officer need not\nbe physically present at the same location. (b) All provisions of this Part, which are\nnot inconsistent with the specific provisions of this section and Part 398 of\nthis Title, shall apply to hearings conducted by telephone. (c) The hearing will be held by means other\nthan telephone in the following circumstances: (1)\nwhen the applicant or recipient makes a\nrequest for an in-person hearing; (2)\nwhen, in the judgment of OAH or the\nhearing officer, a party's due process rights would best be served by\nconducting a hearing in person; or\n(3)\nwhen, in the judgment of OAH or the\nhearing officer, there are circumstances presented by the appellant which make\nproceeding with the hearing by telephone fundamentally unfair.
