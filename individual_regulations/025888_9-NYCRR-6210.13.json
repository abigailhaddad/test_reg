  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6210.13 - Standards for determining valid votes\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe State Board hereby adopts the following regulations to\nprovide for uniform, non discriminatory standards for establishing what\nconstitutes a vote and what shall be counted as a vote for all categories of\nvoting systems and voting procedures used in New York. The following standards shall apply in determining whether a\nballot has been properly voted and whether a vote should be counted for any\noffice or ballot question. (a) The\nfollowing general standards shall apply in the counting of all ballots and\nvotes, regardless of the voting system used: (1)\nA ballot that is marked or signed by the\nvoter in such a way that it can be identified from other ballots must be voided\nand none of its votes counted. Examples of such markings include, but are not\nlimited to: voter signature, initials, voter name and address, voter\nidentification number, messages or text, or unusual markings not related to\nindication of the vote choice for a contest. If there are distinctly\nidentifiable markings on one page of a multiple-page ballot, the entire ballot\nmust be voided. (2)\nA vote for any\ncandidate or ballot measure shall not be rejected solely because the voter\nfailed to follow instructions for marking the ballot. If, for any reason, it is\nimpossible to determine the choice of the voter for any candidate or ballot\nquestion, the vote for that candidate or ballot question shall be considered\nvoid. (3)\nA mark is considered\nvalid when it is clear that it represents the voter's choice and is the\ntechnique consistently used by the voter to indicate his or her selections. Such marks may include, but are not limited to, properly filled in voting\nposition targets, cross mark \"X\", a checkmark \"[TICK]\"\", circles, completed\nopen arrow \"<- \", or any other clear indication of the voter's choice. (i) A mark crossed out by the voter, an\nerasure, or words such as no next to a candidate's name or a voting position\ntarget area for a ballot question shall not be considered to be a valid vote\nbut will, instead, be deemed an indication that the voter did not choose to\ncast a vote for that candidate or measure and the vote for that candidate or\nproposition shall be considered void. (4)\n\nIn determining the validity of a\npartially filled-in voting position target area, the consistency of a voter's\nmarks on the entire ballot shall be taken into consideration. A hesitation mark\nsuch as a dot in the voting position target area shall not be considered a\nvalid mark unless it is demonstrated that the voter consistently marked his or\nher ballot in such a manner. (5)\n\nOvervote. If a contest is marked with a greater number of choices of different\ncandidates or ballot questions than the number for which he or she is lawfully\nentitled to vote, the vote shall not be counted for that contest, but shall be\ncounted in all other contests in which there are no overvotes and the voter's\nchoice can be clearly determined. (6)\n\nUndervote. If a contest is marked with a\nlesser number of choices of candidates or ballot questions than the number for\nwhich he or she is lawfully entitled to vote, the votes cast for all otherwise\nproperly marked candidates or ballot questions shall be counted. (7)\n\nIf a ballot is marked in each of two or\nmore target areas or sensitive areas for a candidate whose name appears on the\nballot more than once for the same office, and the total number of votes cast\nfor such race for different candidates does not exceed the number for which he\nor she is lawfully entitled to vote, only the first vote for such candidate\nwith multiple markings shall be counted for such candidate. (8)\n\nBallots that are damaged, torn by the\n\nBoard of Elections or its agents, or otherwise non-machine processable as\nsubmitted by the voter, shall be manually counted by a bipartisan team of\nelection inspectors and such vote totals shall be added to the canvass of such\nother valid ballots for the respective office(s) and ballot\nquestions. (9)\n\nUnintended machine\nmarks placed on a ballot by the voting system that are not made at the\ndirection of the voter shall not invalidate the ballot. (10)\n\nIf two or more persons are to be\nnominated or elected to the same office or position, a voter may vote for one\nor more persons whose names do appear on the ballot and one or more persons\nwhose names do not appear on the ballot, provided that the total number of\nvotes cast by the voter for that office or position does not exceed the number\nof persons to be elected or nominated to such office or position. (11)\n\nAbandoned ballot. (i) If a voter leaves the voting machine or\nsystem without casting their ballot, a bipartisan team of election inspectors\nshall cause the ballot to be cast as the voter left it, without examining the\nballot. (ii)\n\nIf a voter leaves\ntheir paper ballot in a privacy booth and leaves the polling place without\nfirst casting that ballot on the voting device, such ballot shall be marked\nspoiled and retained by the election inspectors, accounted for in the statement\nof canvass, and returned in secure storage with such other spoiled ballots to\nthe county board. (12)\n\nWrite-in votes are votes cast for a person or persons whose name(s) do not\nappear on the official ballot. (i) Write-in\nvotes for persons who names appear on the official ballot for that office or\nparty position shall not be counted. (ii)\nA write-in vote may be cast by the use\nof a name stamp. (iii)\nA write-in\nvote must be cast in the appropriate place on the machine, or it shall be void\nand not counted. (iv)\nA voter need\nnot write in the first and last name of a candidate in every situation; the\nstandard is whether the election inspectors can reasonably determine the intent\nof the voter when they cast their ballot. (13)\n\nIf a ballot is received that is a\n\nFederal write-in absentee ballot (pursuant to\n42\nUSC section\n1973ff-2\n), the county board shall\ncanvass the ballot as follows: (i) If the\noverseas voter designated a candidate by writing in the name of the candidate\nor writing in the name of a political party, the vote is counted for the\ncandidate of that party. (ii)\n\nIf\nthe overseas voter wrote in only the last name of a candidate whose name\nappears on the ballot, the vote is counted for that candidate. (iii)\n\nIf the voter wrote in the name of only\na candidate for president or only a candidate for vice-president whose name\nappears on the ballot, the vote is counted for the electors of that candidate. The name is entered into the canvass as the official ballot name of the\npresidential candidate. (iv)\n\nAbbreviations, misspellings or other minor variations in the form of the name\nof a candidate or political party shall be disregarded if the intention of the\nvoter can be ascertained. The name is entered into the canvass so that its\nspelling matches the spelling of the candidate's official ballot name. If it is\nimpossible to determine the voter's choice of a candidate or candidates for an\noffice upon the official ballot, such vote shall not be counted, but shall be\nreturned as a blank vote.
