  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 861.12 - Temperature\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Trout\nwaters. In waters classified for trout use the discharge of waste\neffluent shall not increase the ambient temperature of the receiving waters by\nmore than 5°F (2.8°C) until stream temperatures reach 50°F (10.0°C), nor by\nmore than 2°F (1.1°C) when stream temperatures are between 50°F (10.0°C) and\n58°F (14.4°C), nor shall such discharge result in stream temperature exceeding\n58°F (14.4°C), which temperatures shall be measured in the stream outside of\nheat dissipation areas as described in subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (b) Other\nnontidal waters. In nontidal waters other than described in subdivision\n(a) of this section, the discharge of waste effluents shall not increase the\nambient temperature of the receiving waters by more than 5°F (2.8°C), nor shall\nsuch discharge result in stream temperature exceeding 87°F (30.6°C), which\ntemperatures shall be measured in the stream outside of heat dissipation areas\nas described in subdivision (f) of this section. (c) Zones 2, 3 and 4. The induced temperature increase shall not exceed 5°F\n(2.8°C) above the average 24-hour temperature gradient displayed during the\n1961-1966 period, or a maximum of 86°F (30.0°C), whichever is less, which\ntemperatures shall be measured outside of designated heat dissipation areas as\ndescribed in subdivision (f) of this section. (1)\n\nThe average 24-hour temperature gradient\ndisplayed during the 1961-1966 period may be interpolated from the following\ntable, which is based on available records: Zone\n2\n\nDate\nRM 133.4 to\n108.4\nRM 108.4 to\n95.0\nRM 95.0 to\n78.8\n(1)\n(2a)\n(2b)\n(3a)\n(3b)\n(4a)\n(4b)\n°F\n°C\n°F\n°C\n°F\n°C\nJan. 1\n37\n2.8\n41\n5.0\n42\n5.6\n\nFeb. 1\n35\n1.7\n35\n1.7\n36\n2.2\n\nMarch 1\n38\n3.3\n38\n3.3\n40\n4.4\n\nApril 1\n46\n7.8\n46\n7.8\n47\n8.3\n\nMay 1\n58\n14.4\n58\n14.4\n58\n14.4\n\nJune 1\n71\n21.7\n71\n21.7\n72\n22.2\n\nJuly 1\n79\n26.1\n79\n26.1\n80\n26.7\n\nAug. 1\n81\n27.2\n81\n27.2\n81\n27.2\n\nSept. 1\n78\n25.6\n79\n26.1\n78\n25.6\n\nSept. 15\n76\n24.4\n77\n25.0\n76\n24.4\n\nOct. 1\n70\n21.1\n70\n21.1\n70\n21.1\n\nNov. 1\n59\n15.0\n61\n16.1\n60\n15.6\n\nDec. 1\n46\n7.8\n50\n10.0\n50\n10.0\n\nDec. 15\n40\n4.4\n45\n7.2\n45\n7.2\n(d) Zone 5. The induced increase above ambient temperature shall not\nexceed 4°F (2.2°C) from September to May and 1.5°F (0.8°C) from June to August, or a maximum of 86°F (30.0°C), whichever is less, which temperatures shall be\nmeasured outside of designated heat dissipation areas as described in\nsubdivision (f) of this section. (e) Zone 6. The induced increase above ambient temperature shall not\nexceed 4°F (2.2°C) from September to May and 1.5°F (0.8°C) from June to August, or a maximum of 85°F (29.4°C), whichever is less, which temperatures shall be\nmeasured outside of designated heat dissipation areas as described in\nsubdivision (f) of this section. (f) Heat dissipation areas. The limitations specified above may be exceeded by\nspecial permit in heat dissipation areas designated on a case-by-case basis, subject to the following conditions: (1)\n\nZones 1A, 1B and 1C. (i) Maximum length. As a guideline, heat\ndissipation areas shall not be longer than 1,000 feet, or 20 times the average\nwidth of the stream, whichever is less, measured from the point where the waste\ndischarge enters the stream. (ii)\n\nMaximum width. Heat dissipation areas shall not exceed a maximum width of\none-half the surface width of the stream or the width encompassing one-half of\nthe entire cross-sectional area of the stream, whichever is less. Within any\none heat dissipation area only one shore shall be used in determining the\nlimits of the area. (2)\n\nZones 1D and 1E. (i) Maximum length. As a\nguidelines, heat dissipation areas shall not be longer than 3,500 feet, or 20\ntimes the average width of the stream, whichever is less, measured from the\npoint where the waste discharge enters the stream. (ii)\n\nMaximum width. Heat dissipation areas\nshall not exceed a maximum width of one-half the surface width of the stream or\nthe width encompassing one-half of the entire cross-sectional area of the\nstream, whichever is less. Within any one heat dissipation area only one shore\nshall be used in determining the limits of the area. (3)\n\nZones 2, 3 and 4. (i) Maximum length. As a guideline, heat\ndissipation areas shall not be longer than 3,500 feet, measured from the point\nwhere the waste discharge enters the stream. (ii)\n\nMaximum width. Heat dissipation areas\nshall not exceed a maximum width of two-thirds the surface width measured from\nshore to shore at any stage of tide. Within any one heat dissipation area only\none shore shall be used in determining the limits of the area. (iii)\n\nMaximum cross-section. Heat dissipation\nareas shall not exceed a maximum of one-quarter of the cross-sectional area of\nthe stream. (4)\n\nZones 5\nand 6. Maximum length. As a guideline, heat dissipation areas\nshall not be longer than 3,500 feet, measured from the point where the waste\ndischarge enters the stream. (5)\n\nAll other zones. (i) Maximum length. As a guideline, heat\ndissipation areas shall not be longer than 1,000 feet, or 20 times the average\nwidth of the stream, whichever is less, measured from the point where the waste\ndischarge enters the stream. (ii)\n\nMaximum width. Heat dissipation areas shall not exceed a maximum width of\none-half the surface width of the stream or the width encompassing one-half of\nthe entire cross-sectional area of the stream, whichever is less. Within any\none heat dissipation area only one shore shall be used in determining the\nlimits of the area. (6)\n\nAdjacent heat dissipation areas. Where waste discharges would result in heat dissipation\nareas in such close proximity as to impair protected uses, additional\nlimitations may be prescribed to avoid such impairment. (7)\n\nOther considerations. (i) The rate of temperature change in\ndesignated heat dissipation areas shall not cause mortality of fish or\nshellfish. (ii)\n\nThe determination\nof heat dissipation areas in tidal waters shall take into special consideration\nthe extent and nature of the receiving waters so as to meet the intent and\npurpose of the criteria and standards, including provisions for the passage of\nfree-swimming and drifting organisms so that negligible or no effects are\nproduced on their populations. (g) Definitions. (1)\n\nAmbient temperature\nis\nthe temperature of a water body unaffected by the heated waste discharge or\nwaste discharge complex. (2)\n\nNatural temperature\nis the temperature of a water body\nunaffected by artificial sources of waste heat. (3)\n\nStream temperature\nis\nthe temperature of the stream outside of the heat dissipation area. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
