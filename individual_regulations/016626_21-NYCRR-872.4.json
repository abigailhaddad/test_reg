(b) Within the flood fringe, the following\nuses by special permit may be authorized under standards provided: (1)\n\nNonresidential uses generally. Structures\nother than residences shall ordinarily be elevated as herein provided, but may\nin special circumstances be otherwise flood-proofed to a point above the Flood\n\nProtection Elevation. (2)\n\nCommercial uses. Commercial structures shall be elevated so that no first floor\nor basement floor is below the flood protection elevation; or such structures\nmay be flood-proofed to the flood protection elevation. Accessory land uses, such as yards, railroad tracks and parking lots, may be at lower elevations. However, a permit for such facilities to be used by the general public shall\nnot be granted in the absence of a flood warning system, if the area is\ninundated to a depth greater than two feet or subject to flood velocities\ngreater than four feet per second upon the occurrence of the Regulatory\n\nFlood. (3)\n\nManufacturing and\nindustrial uses. Manufacturing and industrial buildings, structures and\nappurtenant works shall be elevated so that no first floor or basement floor is\nbelow the flood protection elevation; or such structures may be flood-proofed\nto the Flood Protection Elevation. Measures shall be taken to minimize\nflood-water interference with normal plant operations especially for streams\nhaving protracted flood durations. Certain accessory land uses as yards and\nparking lots may have lesser protection subject to the flood warning\nrequirements set out in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nUtilities, railroad tracks, streets and\nbridges. Public utility facilities, roads, railroad tracks and bridges shall be\ndesigned to minimize increases in flood elevations and shall be compatible with\nlocal comprehensive flood plain development plans to the extent applicable. Protection to the Flood Protection Elevation shall be provided where failure or\ninterruption of these public facilities would result in danger to the public\nhealth or safety, or where such facilities are essential to the orderly\nfunctioning of the area. Where failure or interruption of service would not\nendanger life or health, a lesser degree of protection may be provided for\nminor or auxiliary roads, railroads or utilities. (5)\n\nWater supply and waste treatment. No new\nconstruction, addition or modification of a water supply or waste treatment\nfacility shall be permitted unless the lowest operating floor of such facility\nis above the Flood Protection Elevation, or the facility is flood-proofed\naccording to plans approved by the commission, nor unless emergency plans and\nprocedures for action to be taken in the event of flooding are prepared. Plans\nshall be filed with the Delaware River Basin Commission and the concerned State\nor States. The emergency plans and procedures shall provide for measures to\nprevent introduction of any pollutant or toxic material into the floodwater or\nthe introduction of floodwaters into potable supplies.
