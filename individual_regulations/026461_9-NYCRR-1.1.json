  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1.1 - Executive Order No. 1: Establishing an Interdepartmental Health and Hospital Council. [1]\nState Regulations\n\nAs a result of legislation adopted in the 1960 Session, the\nadministrative functions of two temporary State health agencies, the\n\nInterdepartmental Health Resources Board and the Joint Hospital Survey and\n\nPlanning Commission, will be transferred to the State Departments of Health and\n\nMental Hygiene. To provide a vehicle for the continued exchange of information\nand for cooperative study and action by the State agencies with\nresponsibilities in the fields of health and hospital care, I hereby establish\nan Interdepartmental Health and Hospital Council which shall consist of the\n\nCommissioners of Health, Social Welfare, Mental Hygiene, Education, and\n\nInsurance. The chairman of the Council shall be elected by the members and the\nchairmanship rotated annually. This Council is hereby assigned the following functions and\nactivities: (1)\n\nTo conduct joint\nstudy, planning and program development in health areas concerning two or more\ndepartments. (2)\n\nTo serve as\norganized medium of exchange of information among member agencies regarding: (2)\n(a) specific health problems concerning each; (2)\n(b) the\nphilosophies and policies which underline their problem operations; (2)\n(c) the development of new programs in\nindividual agencies which may relate to or possibly serve or be served by\noperations in other agencies. (3)\n\nTo consider new aspects of health\nproblems facing the State and to develop appropriate approaches or\nrecommendations to the Governor as indicated. (4)\n\nTo establish framework for\ninterdepartmental consultation. (5)\n\nTo study problems of personnel recruitment and training in health disciplines\nutilized by two or more departments. Health areas to be studied shall include, but not be\nlimited to rehabilitation, health services for the aging, alcoholism, narcotic\naddiction, mental retardation, emotional disturbances of children, standards of\nhospital facilities and services, methods of financing hospital care, and\nothers as may be assigned by the Governor. The Council may appoint such committees, as may be\nindicated, consisting of specialists from the individual departments or\nagencies concerned. Each committee shall choose its own chairman who will be\nresponsible for guiding the work of the committee, maintaining its records and\npreparing reports for the Council. The Department of Health shall provide from among its\nemployees the staff services for the Council and the committees. The staff functions shall include the following: (1)\n\nPerformance of necessary staff work for\n\nInterdepartmental Health and Hospital Council, including preparation for\nmeetings, recording of proceedings, and follow-up of directives. (2)\n\nService in similar staff functions to\n\nGovernor's Council on Rehabilitation, in accord with Governor's Special Message\non Rehabilitation of March 16, 1959. (3)\n\nAssistance to chairmen of special\ncommittees in meeting committee objectives. (4)\n\nCollection of pertinent data and perform\nsuch studies as indicated to assist the Council in joint program planning. The Council may request any department or agency\nrepresented on the Council to provide such resources, including personnel, assistance and data, as will enable the Council properly to carry out its\nactivities. The experimental work of the Interdepartmental Health\n\nResources Board and the Joint Hospital Survey and Planning Commission have\nhelped New York State maintain its leadership in the fields of health and\nhospital care. The programs, which proved their worth, will not be continued by\nthe regular State departments. I look to the Interdepartmental Health and\n\nHospital Council to continue this progress through the joint efforts of its\nmember departments which are directly concerned with the health of our\npeople.
