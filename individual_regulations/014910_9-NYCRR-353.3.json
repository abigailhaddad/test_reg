  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 353.3 - Rules\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each local\nprobation director shall be responsible for ensuring that his or her respective\nprobation department adheres to the accounting procedures for probation\ndepartments issued by the Office of the State Comptroller with respect to\nhandling of all financial obligations which the department collects or similar\nprocedures which establish a system of controls to guarantee accurate and\ntimely collection and disbursement of financial obligations. (b) Every local probation department shall\nensure that all financial obligations are promptly disbursed to intended\nbeneficiaries or paid over to appropriate county officials, and reported to\n\nState and/or local officials consistent with any timeframes established in law, by court order or release conditions. Information relating to financial\nobligations shall be reported to the Division of Probation and Correctional\n\nAlternatives consistent with applicable law and as determined by the\ndivision. (c) Interest accrued and\nany undisbursed restitution payments shall be designated for the payment of\nrestitution order that have remained unsatisfied for the longest period of\ntime. Reasonable efforts for purposes of such payments shall include initial\nnotice by mail to the address of record and contact with the United States post\noffice or telephone information service for a possible forwarding address or\nnew telephone listing. In the event that an intended beneficiary dies prior to\ncompletion of the restitution, the remaining payments shall be made to the\nestate of the deceased. Every local probation department shall establish a\nwritten procedure for handling of undisbursed restitution payments, including\nany interest earned. Unsatisfied restitution orders shall mean that the last\nschedule payment is at least 60 calendar days overdue. A probation department\nshall establish a current listing of unsatisfied restitution orders in order to\ndetermine which crime victim has gone unsatisfied for the longest period of\ntime. Monies may be disbursed based upon month or year of the unsatisfied\norder, and a local director shall provide for a mechanism whereby crime victims\nreceive a proportion or fixed amount of undisbursed monies and interest earned. Nothing shall preclude a local probation director from disbursing monies in\nexcess of the amount of disbursement as calculated above, based upon undue\nhardship of the victim after confirming such hardship. (d) Repeated failure to make financial\nobligations as required by law shall be timely reported to the appropriate\ncourt, local conditional release commission, or the Board of Parole. Notes\nN.Y.
