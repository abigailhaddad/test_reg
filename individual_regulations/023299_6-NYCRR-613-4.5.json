(1)\n\nAn AST system is out of\nservice if: (i) the facility owner (or their\nauthorized representative) takes the tank system out of service by submitting\nan application to the Department, in accordance with subparagraph 1.9(c)(4)(ii)\nof this Part, indicating that the tank system is out of service; or\n(ii)\nthe tank system is no longer receiving\nor dispensing petroleum. Within 30 days after the tank system no longer\nreceives or dispenses petroleum, the facility owner (or their authorized\nrepresentative) must submit an application to the Department, in accordance\nwith subparagraph 1.9(c)(4)(ii) of this Part, indicating that the tank system\nis out of service. (2)\n\nOut-of-service AST systems are still subject to all applicable requirements of\nthis Part, with the exception of periodic operation and maintenance walkthrough\ninspections and leak detection required under subdivisions\n4.2\n(h), and 4.3(a)\nand (b) of this Part, respectively, if the AST system is empty. (An AST system\nis considered empty when all petroleum has been removed using commonly employed\npractices so that no more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue remain in\nthe AST system.)\n(i) The suspended\nrequirements of subdivisions\n4.2\n(h), and 4.3(a)\nand (b) of this Subpart must resume in accordance with the original schedule\nwhen the AST system is returned to service. However, if the AST system has been\nout of service such that any of the next periodic\ntesting/monitoring/inspections was not conducted in accordance with the\noriginal schedule, the testing/monitoring/inspection must be performed when the\nAST system is returned to service. (ii)\n\nFor AST system taken out of service due\nto repairs (in response to a leak), the repair and subsequent testing\nrequirements of subparagraph 4.2(j) of this Subpart must be successfully\ncompleted before the AST system is returned to service. (3)\n\nWhen an AST system is out of service for\nmore than 90 days, or has not received or dispensed petroleum in a 90-day\nperiod, the following must also be performed: (i) empty the tank so that no more than 2.5\ncentimeters (one inch) of residue remains; (ii)\nleave vent lines open and functioning; and\n(iii)\ncap and secure all\npiping, fill ports, gauge openings, vapor returns, pump connections, ancillary\nequipment, and manways. (4)\n\nWhen an AST system is out of service for\nmore than 12 months, or has not received or dispensed petroleum in a 12-month\nperiod, the AST system must be permanently closed in accordance with\nsubdivision (b) of this section, unless the AST system is located at a facility\nwhere one or more other tank systems are in-service. (b) Permanent closure. (1)\n\nAt least 30 days before permanent\nclosure, the facility owner (or their authorized representative) must notify\nthe Department of this action, unless such action is in response to corrective\naction in accordance with Subpart 7 of this Part. (2)\n\nWithin 30 days after permanent closure, the facility owner (or their authorized representative) must submit an\napplication to the Department, in accordance with subparagraph 1.9(c)(7)(ii) of\nthis Part, indicating that the AST system has been permanently\nclosed. (3)\n\nAll scheduled\ndeliveries to AST systems that have undergone permanent closure, must be\nterminated. (4)\n\nMethods of\npermanent closure. (i) To perform a\ntank removal, all liquids and accumulated sludge must be removed from the tank\nsystem prior to removing the tank from the ground. All lines (including\ndelivery piping) must be either disconnected and removed, or securely capped or\nplugged. One of the following codes of practice (refer to section\n1.10\nof this Part for complete\ncitation of references) must be adhered to in order to comply with this\nparagraph: (a) PEI RP 1700, 2018 edition; or\n(b) a code of practice developed\nby a nationally recognized association or independent testing laboratory and\napproved by the Department. (ii)\n\nTo perform an in-place closure, all\nliquids, accumulated sludge, and petroleum vapors must be removed from the tank\nsystem prior to stenciling the tank with the date of permanent closure. The\ntank must be protected from flotation. All lines (including delivery piping)\nmust be either disconnected and removed, or securely capped or plugged, and all\nmanways must be securely fastened in place. One of the following codes of\npractice (refer to section\n1.10\nof this Part for complete\ncitation of references) must be adhered to in order to comply with this\nparagraph: (a) PEI RP 1700, 2018 edition; or\n(b) a code of practice developed\nby a nationally recognized association of independent testing laboratory and\napproved by the Department. (iii)\n\nTo perform a change-in-service, all\nliquids, accumulated sludge, and petroleum vapors must be removed from the tank\nsystem prior to changing the stored substance. One of the following codes of\npractice (refer to section\n1.10\nof this Part for complete\ncitation of references) must be adhered to in order to comply with this\nparagraph: (a) API RP 2015, August\n2001; (b) API RP 2016, August\n2001; (c) NFPA 326, 2010 edition; or\n(d) a code of practice developed\nby a nationally recognized association or independent testing laboratory and\napproved by the Department. (5)\nAST systems that have been permanently\nclosed may not be returned to service unless all components of the AST system\nmeet applicable requirements for the latest Category. (c) Recordkeeping. Records\nrequired by this section must be retained for three years after permanent\nclosure, or until the facility has been permanently closed, whichever is later. Copies of these records must also be submitted to the Department within 30 days\nafter permanent closure and must consist of a report detailing that the tank\nwas permanently closed in accordance with subparagraph (b)(4)(i), (ii), or\n(iii) of this section.
