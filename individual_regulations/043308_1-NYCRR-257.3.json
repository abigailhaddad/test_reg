  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 257.3 - Brand and product names\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The brand name and product name of any commercial feed shall be appropriate for\nthe intended use of the feed and shall not be misleading. If either such name\nindicates the feed is made for a specific use, the character of the feed shall\nconform therewith; for example, a mixture labeled \"dairy feed\" shall be\nsuitable for that purpose. (b) Commercial, brand or trade names shall not be permitted in any guaranteed\nanalysis or ingredient listing. (c) The name of any commercial feed shall not be derived from one or more\ningredients of a mixture to the exclusion of other ingredients and shall not\nrepresent any components of a mixture unless all components are included in the\nname; provided, that if any ingredient or combination of ingredients is\nintended to impart a distinctive characteristic to the product which is of\nsignificance to the purchaser, the name of that ingredient or combination of\ningredients may be used as a part of the brand name or product name if the\ningredient or combination of ingredients is quantitatively guaranteed in the\nguaranteed analysis, and the brand name or product name is not otherwise false\nor misleading. (d) The word\n\"protein\" shall not be permitted in the product name of any feed that contains\nadded non-protein nitrogen. (e) When the brand name or product name carries a percentage value, it shall\nsignify actual protein and/or equivalent protein content only, even though it\nmay not explicitly modify the percentage with the word \"protein\"; provided, that other percentage values may be permitted if they are followed by the\nproper description and conform to good labeling practice. When a figure is used\nin any brand name (except in mineral, vitamin, or other products where the\nprotein guarantee is nil or unimportant), it shall be preceded by the word\n\"number\" or some other suitable designation. (f) Single ingredient feeds shall have a\nproduct name in accordance with the official definitions of feed ingredients as\nrecognized by AAFCO unless the commissioner prescribes otherwise. (g) The word \"vitamin\", or any contraction\nthereof, or any word suggesting vitamin, can be used only in the name of a feed\nwhich is represented to be a vitamin supplement, and which is labeled with the\nminimum content of each vitamin declared, as provided in section\n257.4\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (h) The term \"mineralized\"\nshall not be used in the name of any feed, except for \"trace mineralized salt\". When the latter expression is used, the product shall contain significant\namounts of trace minerals which are recognized as essential for animal\nnutrition. (i) The terms \"meat\" and\n\"meat by-products\" shall be qualified to designate the animal from which the\nmeat or meat by-products are derived unless the meat or meat by-products are\nfrom cattle, swine, sheep and goats.
