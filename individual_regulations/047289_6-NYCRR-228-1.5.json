  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 228-1.5 - Requirements for controlling voc emissions using add-on controls or coating systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Use of coatings\nthat exceed the VOC content limits at application specified in the tables of\nsection\n228-1.4\nof this Subpart is\nprohibited, unless a coating system meeting the requirements of subdivision (d)\nof this section is utilized, control equipment meeting the requirements of\nsubdivisions (b) and (c) of this section is installed and operated, or a\nprocess specific RACT variance is granted under subdivision (e) of this\nsection. (b) Any VOC incinerator\nused as control equipment must be designed and operated to provide, at a\nminimum a 90 percent overall removal efficiency. The department may allow an\nowner or operator of a facility which uses a natural gas fired VOC incinerator\nas a control device for coating lines subject to this Subpart to shut down the\nVOC incinerator from November 1st through March 31st for the purposes of\nnatural gas conservation, provided that the department has determined that this\naction will not jeopardize air quality. (c) The overall removal efficiency of an air\ncleaning device used as a control strategy must be determined, for every\nsurface coating formulation, on a solids as applied basis using Equation 2\nunless a 90 percent or greater overall removal efficiency is achieved by the\nair cleaning device. The air cleaning device must be designed and operated to\nprovide, at a minimum, an overall removal efficiency of either 90 percent or as\ndetermined by Equation 2. Equation 2\n\nImage\n1\nwhere: is the overall removal efficiency\n(VOC)\nc\nis the maximum permissible\npounds of VOC per gallon of coating minus water and excluded VOC at\napplication, as set forth in the tables of this Subpart. (VOC)\na\nis the VOC content of an\nas applied coating, expressed as pounds of VOC per gallon of coating minus\nwater and excluded compounds. (V\nn\n)\nc\nis\nthe volumetric fraction of solids, expressed as gallon of solids per gallon of\ncoating minus water and excluded compounds, in a compliant coating expressed\nas: Equation 3\n(V\nn\n)\nc\n= 1 -\n(V\nv\n)\nc\n(V\nv\n)\nc\nis\nthe volumetric fraction of VOC, expressed as gallon of VOC per gallon of\ncoating minus water and excluded compounds, in a compliant coating expressed\nas: Equation 4\n\nImage\n2\n(V\nn\n)\na\nis\nthe volumetric fraction of solids, expressed as gallon of solids per gallon of\ncoating minus water and excluded compounds, in an as applied coating expressed\nas: Equation 5\n(V\nn\n)\na\n= 1 -\n(V\nv\n)\na\n(V\nv\n)\na\nis\nthe volumetric fraction of VOC, expressed as gallon of VOC per gallon of\ncoating minus water and excluded compounds, in an as applied coating expressed\nas: Equation 6\n\nImage\n3\nd\nvoc\nis the density of VOC as\napplied, i.e., total volatiles minus water and excluded compounds, in pounds of\nVOC per gallon of VOC. (d) An\nowner or operator of a coating line which utilizes a coating system as a\ncontrol strategy, which control strategy may also employ a control device, must\ncomply with the following provisions: (1)\nthe\ncoating system must be approved by the department prior to the use of the\ncoating system in the manufacture of a product for sale; (2)\ncoatings which are applied manually by\nhandheld spray guns cannot be utilized in a coating system; (3)\nthe emission differential (ED) for a\ncoating system must be determined using equation 7 below. The ED for the\ncoating system is the sum of the individual ED values calculated for every\ncoating used in the coating system. The ED calculation requirement is to be\nperformed each time the series of coatings in a coating system is changed. The\ncoating system ED must be less than or equal to zero before the coating system\nmay be operated. Equation 7\n\nImage\n4\nwhere: V is the actual coating volume used, minus water and\nexcluded compounds, in gallons. <\n> is the overall removal efficiency, expressed as: Equation 8\n\nImage\n5\nwhere: <\n>\nc\nis the\npercent CE, as determined by section\n228-1.6\n(d)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. <\n>\nd\nis the\npercent destruction and/or removal efficiency, as determined by section\n228-1.6\n(d)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart. <\n> = 0, for coating systems without a\ncontrol device and capture system. d\nVOC\n= 7.36 pounds of VOC per\ngallon of VOC when (VOC)\na\n= 0 and\n(V\nn\n)\na\n=1\n\nWhen section\n228-1.6\n(d)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart applies, <\n> is the VOC solvent recovery\nfraction. All other terms are defined in subdivision (c) of this\nsection. (4)\nthe ED figures\nfor the individual coating used in the coating system must be calculated on an\ninstantaneous basis. There is no averaging period for individual coatings which\nare part of a coating system; and\n(5)\nthe method or instrument by which the\nowner or operator will measure or calculate the volume of coating applied must\nbe approved by the department. (e) Process specific RACT demonstrations. (1)\n\nThe department may allow surface coating\nprocesses to operate with a lesser degree of control than is required by this\nsection provided that a process specific reasonably available control\ntechnology (RACT) demonstration has been made to the satisfaction of the\ndepartment. Such process specific RACT demonstrations must be submitted to the\nadministrator for approval as a revision to the State Implementation Plan and\nmust address the technical and economic feasibility of: (i) utilizing compliant coating(s) and/or\ninks; (ii)\nutilizing demonstrated\nand proven emission control technologies which would achieve the required\noverall removal efficiency determined pursuant to subdivision (c) of this\nsection; (iii)\nutilizing\ndemonstrated and proven emission control technologies which would achieve a\nlevel of overall removal efficiency less than the required level determined\npursuant to subdivision (c) of this section; and\n(iv)\nutilizing demonstrated and proven\nproduction modification methods which would result in real, documented, and\nenforceable reductions in the VOC emissions from the process. (2)\n\nFacilities with surface\ncoating processes subject to this Part with an annual potential to emit of less\nthan five tons of VOCs will only be required to comply with subparagraphs\n(1)(i) and (iv) of this subdivision in order to demonstrate that a lesser\ndegree of control is RACT for these processes. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n228-1.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
