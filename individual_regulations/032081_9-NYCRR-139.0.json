Tit. 9 § 139.0 - Statement of policy\n\nState Regulations\n\nSubdivision 1-a of section\n131\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law permits the Director of the Budget to promulgate regulations\nauthorizing the appointment of certain persons with training or experience\nwhich substantially exceeds the minimum required for appointment at a salary\nabove the minimum of the grade of the title to which they are appointed.

It is also the\npolicy of the State that appointments under this Part shall be restricted to\noriginal permanent appointments to State service. Compensation of certain\nincumbent State employees with equivalent qualifications of training or\nexperience shall be increased as provided under section\n139.5\nof this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
