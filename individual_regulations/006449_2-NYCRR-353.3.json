  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 353.3 - Medical examinations\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhere the determining authority finds that an application for\nbenefits under section\n507-a\nor\n605\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw raises a medical issue or issues, it shall arrange for the medical\nexaminations of the applicant. Each consulting physician who is retained by the\n\nRetirement System to conduct an examination for the purposes of evaluating the\nmedical basis of an applicant's application shall be required to report in\nwriting his or her findings. The determining authority shall thereupon consider\nsuch report in reaching a determination on the application. Section\n507\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw provides that determination of the issue of whether a member is permanently\nincapacitated for the purposes of that section shall be based on the\ndetermination approving the member's application for primary social security\nbenefits. Accordingly, the determining authority shall not arrange for medical\nexaminations with respect to applications filed under section 507, unless the\ndetermining authority concludes that such examination or examinations are\nnecessary with respect to determining issues of causal relationship between\naccidents alleged on the application and the incapacity which was the basis of\nthe approval of such member's application for primary social security\ndisability benefits. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n353.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
