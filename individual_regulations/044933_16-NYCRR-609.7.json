  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 609.7 - Reconnection of service\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A telephone\ncorporation shall reconnect suspended or terminated basic local exchange\nservice within 24 hours, unless prevented by circumstances beyond the telephone\ncorporation's control or unless a customer requests otherwise, in the following\nsituations: (1)\nreceipt by the telephone\ncorporation of the full amount of arrears for which service was suspended or\nterminated or upon the elimination of conditions that warranted suspension or\ntermination of service; (2)\nagreement by the telephone corporation and the customer on a deferred payment\nplan and the payment of a down payment, if required, under the plan; (3)\nwhere a telephone corporation has notice\nthat a serious impairment to health or safety exists and telephone service is\nnecessary to insure accessibility of emergency medical assistance, assistance\nrelating to medical care or professional advice. Doubts as to whether\nreconnection of service is required for health or safety reasons shall be\nresolved in favor of reconnection; or\n(4)\nupon the direction of the commission or\nits designee. Comment:A telephone corporation may not insist upon payment\nof lawful charges that did not provide the basis for suspension or termination\nbefore restoring service under this subdivision. In these circumstances, payment of other lawful charges that did not form the basis for the suspension\nor termination should be part of the deferred payment plan in accordance with\nsection\n609.8\nof this Part, unless the\ncustomer elects to pay such charge immediately. (b) Whenever circumstances beyond the\ntelephone corporation's control prevent reconnection of service within 24 hours\nof any of the events specified in subdivision (a) of this section, service\nshall be reconnected within 12 hours after those circumstances cease to\nexist. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n609.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
