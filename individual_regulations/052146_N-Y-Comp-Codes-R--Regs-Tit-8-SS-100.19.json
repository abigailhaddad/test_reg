Applications must set forth the need for such funds, whether the school\ndistrict is seeking operating funds and/or capital funds, how the funds would\nbe used and the number of students that would be served with such funds.

Each designated school that receives a grant to deliver co-located\nor school-linked services pursuant to this subdivision shall first provide such\nservices to the students who are enrolled in such school and their families. (i) If a designated school has additional\nunused capacity after making such services available to all enrolled students\nand their families (\ne.g., not all available times for health\nor dental screenings have been filled on a particular day after all students\nenrolled in the school have been given an opportunity for an appointment, or\nnot all seats in a parenting workshop have been filled by parents of students\nwho attend the school), the school may offer such services to students who\nattend feeder schools and their families so as to maximize effective and\nefficient use of available resources and/or students who are alumni of the\nschool and their families in order to provide continuity of services. (ii)\n\nFor purposes of this subdivision, feeder school\nshall mean a school that receives title I funds\nor is eligible for, but does not receive title I funds, and from which at least\n20 percent of the students in the designed school matriculated, provided that, for designated schools in which school choice, admissions lotteries, and/or\nopen enrollment exist and in which feeder school patterns are therefore not\nconsistent from year to year, the school district may request that a lesser\npercentage of students matriculating into the designed schools be considered or\nthat up to three schools in the closest geographic proximity to the designated\nschools and from which students matriculate to such schools be feeder schools\nfor purposes of this subdivision.
