  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 481.5 - Penalty assessed for nonpayment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nperson who must pay a program fee pursuant to section\n481.2\nof this Part is obligated to\npay the entire amount of the invoiced program fee. A person failing to pay the\ndepartment an annual program fee within 45 days of the last applicable date\nprescribed in section\n481.3\nof this Part, must pay a\npenalty. (b) If a person has paid\nthe portion of the fee which is not being disputed as provided in section\n481.9\n(b) of this\n\nPart, the penalty for nonpayment of the disputed portion will not be applied\nuntil the dispute is either resolved by mutual agreement or denied after\nhearing. The penalty, if any, will then be imposed on the redetermined\ndeficiency from the date such penalty was initially applicable. A challence to\nan invoiced outstanding fee is not a basis for a reduction in penalty under\nsection\n481.5\n(d) of this\n\nPart if the dispute is resolved in favor of the department. (c) Except for the penalties described in\nsection\n72-0201\n(12)\nof the Environmental Conservation Law as\nthat applies to operating permit program fees, the penalty assessed under this\nsection is based upon the amount of the payment deficiency and is equal to up\nto five percent of that deficiency per month, not to exceed 25 percent of the\ndeficiency. (d) If the department\ndetermines that a penalty will be assessed, it will notify the person affected\nsetting forth the person's right to appeal. The assessed penalty is final and\nirrevocable unless within 30 days of the imposition of the penalty, the person\nsends to the Director of Fiscal Management, by certified mail, a written\nrequest to redetermine the penalty. The Director of Fiscal Management, within\n30 days, shall make a determination concerning the penalty and notify the\nperson requesting the redetermination. If the person receiving the penalty\nassessment disagrees with the determination of the Director of Fiscal\n\nManagement, that person may send to the commissioner, by certified mail, a\nwritten request for hearing. This request must set forth the basis for the\nfailure to pay the fee and must be postmarked within 30 days of the person's\nreceipt of the department's notice that a penalty will be assessed. The hearing\nprovided for under this subdivision is subject to the provisions of section\n481.10\nof this Part. The\ncommissioner's decision to rescind or reduce a penalty must be based upon a\nfinding that the failure to pay the fee was based upon reasonable cause and not\ndue to willful neglect. The absence of willful neglect alone is not sufficient\ngrounds for not imposing a penalty. After the hearing, the commissioner will\nnotify the person of the final determination. (e) No penalty determined under the\nprovisions of this section may be finally assessed until the period in which a\nhearing may be requested has expired or a final determination after a hearing\nhas been issued, whichever is later.
