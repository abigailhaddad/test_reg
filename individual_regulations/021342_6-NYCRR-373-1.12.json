  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-1.12 - Integration with Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Options for\nincinerators, cement kilns, lightweight aggregate kilns, solid fuel boilers, liquid fuel boilers and hydrochloric acid production furnaces to minimize\nemissions from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events. (1)\n\nFacilities with existing permits. (i) Revisions to permit conditions after\ndocumenting compliance with MACT. The owner or operator of a Part 373-permitted\nincinerator, cement kiln, lightweight aggregate kiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid\nfuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid production furnace may request that the\ndepartment address permit conditions that minimize emissions from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events under any of the following options when\nrequesting removal of permit conditions that are no longer applicable according\nto sections\n373-2.15\n(a)(3)\nand\n374-1.8\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Title: (a) retain relevant permit\nconditions. Under this option, the department will: (1)\n\nRetain permit conditions that address\nreleases during startup, shutdown, and malfunction events, including releases\nfrom emergency safety vents, as these events are defined in the facility's\nstartup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required under 40 CFR part\n63, section\n1206(c)(2) of subpart EEE, as incorporated by reference and implemented by\nsection\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title; and\n(2)\n\nLimit\napplicability of the permit conditions identified in subclause\n(\n1\n) of this clause to the period when the facility is\noperating under its startup, shutdown, and malfunction\nplan. (b) revise relevant\npermit conditions. (1)\n\nUnder this option, the\ndepartment will: (i) Identify a subset of\nrelevant existing permit requirements, or develop alternative permit\nrequirements, that ensure emissions of toxic compounds are minimized from\nstartup, shutdown, and malfunction events, including releases from emergency\nsafety vents, based on review of information including the source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan, design, and operating history. (ii)\n\nRetain or add the permit requirements\nidentified in item (\ni\n) of this subclause to the permit to\napply only when the facility is operating under its startup, shutdown, and\nmalfunction plan. (2)\n\nChanges that may significantly increase emissions. (i) The owner or operator must notify the\ndepartment in writing of changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan\nor changes to the design of the source that may significantly increase\nemissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, or malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents. The owner or operator must\nnotify the department of such changes within five days of making such changes. The owner or operator must identify in the notification recommended revisions\nto permit conditions necessary as a result of the changes to ensure that\nemissions of toxic compounds are minimized during these events. (ii)\n\nThe department may revise permit\nconditions as a result of these changes to ensure that emissions of toxic\ncompounds are minimized during startup, shutdown, or malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents either: (A)\nupon permit renewal; or\n(B)\nby modifying the permit under section\n373-1.7\nof this Subpart, if\nwarranted; (C)\nremove permit\nconditions. Under this option: (I)\nthe owner\nor operator must document that the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan\nrequired under 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE, section 1206(c)(2), has been\napproved by the department under 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE, section\n1206(c)(2)(ii)(B), as incorporated by reference and implemented by sections\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title; and\n(II)\nthe\ndepartment will remove permit conditions that are no longer applicable\naccording to sections\n373-2.15\n(a)(3)\nand\n374-1.8\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Title. (ii)\n\nAddressing permit conditions upon permit\nreissuance. The owner or operator of an incinerator, cement kiln, lightweight\naggregate kiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid\nproduction furnace that has conducted a comprehensive performance test and\nsubmitted to the department a Notification of Compliance documenting compliance\nwith the standards of 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE, as incorporated by reference\nand implemented by section\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title, may request in the application to reissue the permit for the\ncombustion unit that the department control emissions from startup, shutdown, and malfunction events under any of the following options: (a) Part 373 option A. (1)\n\nUnder this option, the department will: (i) Include, in the permit, conditions that\nensure compliance with section\n373-2.15\n(f)(1) and\n(3)\nof this Part or section\n374-1.8\n(c)(5)(i) and\n(ii)\n(\nc\n) of this Title to\nminimize emissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, and malfunction\nevents, including releases from emergency safety vents; and\n(ii)\n\nSpecify that these permit requirements\napply only when the facility is operating under its startup, shutdown, and\nmalfunction plan; or\n(b) Part 373 option B. (1)\n\nUnder this option, the department will: (i) include, in the permit, conditions that\nensure emissions of toxic compounds are minimized from startup, shutdown, and\nmalfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents, based on\nreview of information including the source's startup, shutdown, and malfunction\nplan, design, and operating history; and\n(ii)\nspecify that these permit requirements\napply only when the facility is operating under its startup, shutdown, and\nmalfunction plan. (2)\n\nChanges that may significantly increase emissions. (i) The owner or operator must notify the\ndepartment in writing of changes to the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan\nor changes to the design of the source that may significantly increase\nemissions of toxic compounds from startup, shutdown, or malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents. The owner or operator must\nnotify the department of such changes within five days of making such changes. The owner or operator must identify in the notification recommended revisions\nto permit conditions necessary as a result of the changes to ensure that\nemissions of toxic compounds are minimized during these events. (ii)\n\nThe department may revise permit\nconditions as a result of these changes to ensure that emissions of toxic\ncompounds are minimized during startup, shutdown, or malfunction events, including releases from emergency safety vents either: (A)\nupon permit renewal; or\n(B)\nby modifying the permit under section\n373-1.7\nof this Subpart, if\nwarranted; or\n(C)\nCAA option. Under\nthis option: (I)\n\nThe owner or operator must\ndocument that the startup, shutdown, and malfunction plan required under 40 CFR\npart\n63, subpart EEE, section 1206(c)(2) has been approved by the department\nunder 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE, section 1206(c)(2)(ii)(B), as incorporated\nby reference and implemented by section\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title; and\n(II)\n\nThe\ndepartment will omit, from the permit, conditions that are not applicable under\nsections\n373-2.15\n(a)(3)\nand\n374-1.8\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Title. (2)\n\nInterim status facilities. (i) Interim status operations.
