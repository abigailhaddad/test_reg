  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 202.20-f - Disclosure Disputes. Disclosure Disputes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To the maximum extent possible, discovery\ndisputes should be resolved through informal procedures, such as conferences, as opposed to motion practice. (b) Absent exigent circumstances, prior to contacting the court regarding a\ndisclosure dispute, counsel must first consult with one another in a good faith\neffort to resolve all disputes about disclosure. Such consultation must take\nplace by an in-person or telephonic conference. In the event that a discovery\ndispute cannot be resolved other than through motion practice, each such\ndiscovery motion shall be supported by an affidavit or affirmation from counsel\nattesting to counsel having conducted an in-person or telephonic conference, setting forth the date and time of such conference, persons participating, and\nthe length of time of the conference. The unreasonable failure or refusal of\ncounsel to participate in a conference requested by another party may relieve\nthe requesting party of the obligation to comply with this paragraph and may be\naddressed by the imposition of sanctions pursuant to Part 130. If the moving\nparty was unable to conduct a conference due to the unreasonable failure or\nrefusal of an adverse party to participate, then such moving party shall, in an\naffidavit or affirmation, detail the efforts made by the moving party to obtain\nsuch a conference and set forth the responses received. (c) The failure of counsel to comply with\nthis rule may result in the denial of a discovery motion, without prejudice to\nrenewal once the provisions of this rule have been complied with, or in such\nmotion being held in abeyance until the informal resolution procedures of the\ncourt are conducted.
