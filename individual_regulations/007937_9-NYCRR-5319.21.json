  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.21 - Bill validators and other methods of inserting financial instruments into a gaming device\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Bill\n\nValidators. All paper currency acceptance devices shall be able to detect the\nentry of valid bills, coupons, vouchers or other approved notes, as applicable, and provide a method to enable the gaming device software to interpret and act\nappropriately upon a valid or invalid input. A paper currency acceptance device\nshall be electronically based and be configured to ensure that such device\naccepts only valid bills of legal tender, coupons, vouchers or other approved\nnotes, and shall reject all other items. Rejected bills, vouchers, coupons or\nother approved notes should be returned to the player. Vouchers are paper slips\nthat are treated as a unit of currency, which may be redeemed for cash or\nexchanged for credits on the gaming device. Coupons are paper slips primarily\nused for promotional purposes, which may be of a cashable or non-cashable\nvalue. A bill input system shall be constructed in a manner that protects\nagainst vandalism, abuse or fraudulent activity. (1)\n\nEach valid bill, coupon, voucher or other\napproved note shall register the actual monetary value or the appropriate\nnumber of credits received for the denomination being used on the player's\ncredit meter. (2)\n\nCredits shall be\nregistered only when: (i) the bill or other\nnote has passed the point where such bill or note is accepted and stacked; and\n(ii)\nthe acceptor has sent the\n\"irrevocably stacked\" message to the gaming device. (3)\n\nEach bill validator shall be designed to\nprevent the use of cheating methods such as stringing, the insertion of foreign\nobjects and any other manipulation that may be deemed as a cheating technique. A method for detection of counterfeit bills shall be implemented. (4)\n\nAcceptance of any bills, vouchers, coupons or other approved notes for crediting to the credit meter shall be\npossible only when the gaming device is enabled for play. Other states, such as\nerror conditions, including door opens, audit mode and game play, shall cause\nthe disabling of the bill validator system. (5)\n\nEach gaming device or bill validator\nshall have the capability of detecting and displaying the following error\nconditions (for bill validators, it is acceptable to disable or flash lights\nwith respect to the bill validator itself): (i) full stacker, in which case it is\nrecommended that an explicit \"stacker full\" error message not be used, in order\nto minimize security risk; rather, a message such as \"bill validator\nmalfunction\" is suggested; (ii)\nbill jams; (iii)\nstacker door\nopen; (iv)\nstacker removed; and\n(v) any other bill validator\nmalfunction. (b) All bill validators shall communicate to\nthe gaming device using a bi-directional protocol. (c) If bill validators are designed to be\nfactory-set only, no access to such bill validators, maintenance or adjustments\nto such bill validators in the field, shall be permitted, other than: (1)\nthe selection of desired acceptance for\nbills, coupons, vouchers or other approved notes and their limits; (2)\nchanging of certified control program\nmedia or downloading of certified software; (3)\nadjustments of the tolerance level for\naccepting bills or notes of varying quality, but not externally and only if\nadequate levels of security are in place, such as through lock-and-key, physical switch settings or other accepted methods approved by the commission\non a case-by-case basis; (4)\nmaintenance, adjustment and repair per approved factory procedures; or\n(5)\noptions that set the\ndirection or orientation of acceptance. (d) For games that allow tokenization, the\ngame shall record monetary value from the bill acceptor and post to the\nplayer's credit meter the entire amount inserted and display any fractional\ncredits, when applicable. It is acceptable for a device to store the fractional\ncredits if one of the following conditions is met: (1)\nthe game displays the credit meter in\ndollars and cents; or\n(2)\nthe game\ninforms the player that there are fractional credits stored on the device at an\nopportune time, to avoid the possibility of the player walking away from the\ngaming device without such knowledge.
