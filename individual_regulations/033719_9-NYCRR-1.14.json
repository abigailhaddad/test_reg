Tit. 9 § 1.14 - Executive Order No. 14: [Appointing commissioners to examine laws with respect to sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages.]\nState Regulations\nTO ALL TO WHOM THESE PRESENTS SHALL COME, GREETING: The Alcoholic Beverage Control Law was enacted in 1934, following closely the national repeal of the prohibition against the sale and\ndistribution of alcoholic beverages. Although there have been periodic, piecemeal amendments to\nthe Alcoholic Beverage Control Law since its enactment, there has been no major\nreappraisal and revision of the Law in the light of experience and current\nsocial and economic conditions. To maintain public confidence in the operation of the\n\nAlcoholic Beverage Control Law, I deem it to be in the public interest to make\nprovision for a thorough study and reappraisal of the Law, with respect to the\nsale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the State. NOW, THEREFORE, I Nelson A. Rockefeller, pursuant to\n\nSection\nsix\nof the\n\nExecutive Law, have appointed and by these presents do appoint Lawrence E. Walsh, Chairman; William C. Warren; and Manly Fleischmann, as Commissioners to\nstudy and reappraise existing provisions of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law; to examine and investigate the adequacy and effectiveness of existing laws, rules, regulations, practices and procedures with respect to the sale and\ndistribution of alcoholic beverages, including the licensing, supervision and\ncontrol thereof by State and local authorities and the methods and practices of\nmanufacturers, distributors and retailers of alcoholic beverages in the State; and to recommend any revisions necessary or desirable to strengthen and improve\nsuch laws, rules, regulations, practices and procedures. The Commissioners are herby empowered to subpoena and\nenforce the attendance of witnesses, to administer oaths and examine witnesses\nunder oath and to require the production of any books, records or papers deemed\nrelevant or material, and I hereby grant to the Commissioners all and singular\nthe powers and authorities which may be granted to a person appointed by me for\nsuch purposes under authority of Section\nsix\nof the\n\nExecutive Law. The powers hereby conferred may be exercised by the\n\nCommissioners jointly as well as severally. Every State department, division, board, bureau and agency\nshall provide to the Commissioners every assistance, facility and cooperation\nwhich may be proper or desirable for the accomplishment of the purposes for\nwhich the Commissioners are hereby appointed. The mayors or other chief executive officers of all\ncounties, cities, towns, and villages, district attorneys for each of the\ncounties in the State, the sheriffs in such counties, the commissioners of\npolice or persons having comparable titles or duties exercising supervision of\npolice forces within the State, the chairman and members of the State Liquor\n\nAuthority, and the chairman and members of all local Alcoholic Beverage Control\n\nBoards organized or operating pursuant to the provisions of the Alcoholic\n\nBeverage Control Law or any other laws relating to the sale and distribution of\nalcoholic beverages are called upon to cooperate to make available every\nreasonable facility and assistance to the Commissioners in the performance of\ntheir duties. Signed: Nelson A. Rockefeller\n\nDated: February 15, 1963\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n1.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
