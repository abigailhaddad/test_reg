  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 651.17 - Limitations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The estimated\nreasonable cost or actual cost, as the case may be, of an eligible project as\ndefined in section 1263-b of the Public Health Law shall be calculated only\nwith respect to that portion of the erection, building, acquisition, alteration, reconstruction, improvement or extension of the sewage treatment\nworks as defined in section 1263-b of the Public Health Law which is undertaken\nafter May 12, 1965, and before March 31, 1972. (b) The estimate of reasonable cost of a\nproject by the commissioner shall be determined by consideration of costs of\nsimilar projects, together with an engineering evaluation of the degree of\nconstruction difficulty involved in the project. (c) A grant will be made only for\nconstruction of a project for new or additional water pollution\ncontrol. (d) A grant will not be\nmade to an applicant unless it demonstrates to the satisfaction of the\ncommissioner its ability to pay the municipal share of the project. (e) In order to insure effective water\npollution control, economy of capital cost and operation, each project before\napproval will be evaluated in terms of the overall treatment and collection\nneeds of the area in which it is located. The commissioner reserves the right\nto disapprove any application if it does not contribute to the overall\nobjectives of effective water quality management or may become a deterrent to\narea-wide solutions at a later date. (f) Over-design without justification will be\nreason for rejection of an application. All engineering plans submitted with an\napplication will reflect professional responsibility with regard to developing\nmaximum economy in design and construction. (g) Engineering fees must be consistent with\nthe schedules recommended by the American Society of Civil Engineers. (h) A grant will not be made to an applicant\nunless construction specifications provide for alternate equipment or materials\nwhich can provide a satisfactory operating unit. (i) A grant will not be made to an applicant\nunless it provides the commissioner with assurances that: (1)\n\nSufficient qualified operating personnel\nwill be retained and that required operational tests and measurements will be\nperformed to insure proper and efficient operation and maintenance of the\nsewage treatment works from the time of completion of construction or\ncommencement of operation, whichever is earlier, until such time as the\ncommissioner may approve discontinuance of operation or disposal of the\nworks. (2)\n\nThe sewage received by\nthe sewage treatment works will be from a sewage system or systems operated and\nmaintained in accordance with a sewer use ordinance acceptable to the\ncommissioner. (3)\n\nActual\nconstruction work will be performed by the lump sum (fixed price) or unit price\ncontract method or combination thereof. (4)\n\nThe contract and specifications will be\nconsistent with applicable sections of the \"State Architect's Standard\n\nSpecifications\". (5)\n\nWhere required\nby law, competitive bidding will be employed prior to contract awards and that\nthe contract award will be made to the responsible bidder submitting the lowest\nacceptable bid. (6)\n\nThe project\nwill not be advertised or placed on the market for bidding until final plans\nand specifications have been approved by the commissioner, a permit therefor\nhas been issued pursuant to section 1230 of the Public Health Law, and the\napplicant has been notified that advertising and receipt of bids may\ncommence. (7)\n\nEvery construction\ncontract will require the contractor to provide performance and payment bonds\nin amounts not less than the contract price and to maintain during the life of\nthe contract adequate fire and extended coverage, workmen's compensation, public liability, and property damage insurance. (8)\n\nConstruction contracts will not be\nawarded without approval of the bid tabulations and the intent of the applicant\nto award contracts to specific bidders. (9)\n\nAny change or changes in a construction\ncontract in excess of five per cent of the contract price or any change or\nchanges regardless of cost which substantially modify the treatment processes\nproposed will be submitted to the commissioner for prior approval; provided, however, that work of an emergency nature may be ordered by the engineer\nengaged by the applicant pursuant to paragraph (13) below without prior\napproval, if so reported to the commissioner within 48 hours of the time of the\nordered change or changes. (10)\n\nNotification of all change orders not requiring prior approval of the\ncommissioner will be submitted to the commissioner within one month of the time\nat which they are ordered by the engineer; grant payments associated with such\nchange orders may be made by the commissioner at his discretion following\nengineering review of the change order and inspection. (11)\n\nThe construction of the project, including the letting of contracts in connection therewith, will conform to\napplicable requirements of Federal, State and local laws, ordinances, rules and\nregulations. (12)\n\nRepresentatives\nof the commissioner shall have access to the work wherever it is in preparation\nor progress; proper facilities will be furnished for such access and inspection\nand all construction contracts will so provide. (13)\n\nThe applicant will at all times provide\nand maintain competent and adequate resident supervision and inspection under\nthe direction of a licensed professional engineer who will have the\nresponsibility of insuring that the construction conforms with the approved\nplans and specifications and certifying to the applicant and the commissioner\nat the completion of construction that the construction is in accordance with\nthe approved plans and specifications or approved amendments thereto. (14)\n\nAdequate accounting and fiscal records\nwill be maintained so as to reflect the receipt and expenditure of funds for\nthe purpose of the eligible project, and all funds, however provided for the\npayment of the cost of the project, will be credited promptly upon receipt\nthereof to a separate construction account or accounts. (15)\n\nThe construction contract or contracts\nwill be so prepared that eligible items can be readily segregated from\nnoneligible items and so that materials and equipment sold to the applicant may\nbe readily itemized. (16)\n\nThe\napplicant will submit to the commissioner such documents and information as he\nmay require. (17)\n\nThe applicant has\na fee simple title or such other estate or interest in the site of the project, including necessary easements and rights-of-way, as the commissioner finds\nsufficient to assure undisturbed use and possession for the purposes of\nconstruction and operation for the estimated life of the project. (18)\n\nThe applicant will construct the project\nor cause it to be constructed to the final completion in accordance with the\napplication, plans and specifications or amendments thereto approved by the\ncommissioner and the permit issued therefor.
