  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 350.3 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Application\nrights. (1)\n\nAny person has the right to make\napplication for that form of public assistance or care that he or she believes\nwill meet his or her needs. The applicant or any adult member of the\napplicant's family has the right to make application for such assistance or\ncare. If a person establishes a good cause reason, in accordance with section\n351.26\nof this Title, that\nprevents the person from applying for public assistance, that person may\ndesignate in writing a person to act on the person's behalf, including a\nrelative, friend, other agency or institution, and that designee must have the\nright to make an application on the person's behalf and provide information to\nthe social services district to determine the person's initial and continuing\neligibility for public assistance. The designation of an authorized\nrepresentative does not relieve the person of the obligation to cooperate with\nall aspects of initial and continuing eligibility for public assistance and to\nprovide timely and accurate information to the social services\ndistrict. (2)\nA social services\ndistrict may set a limit on the number of households an authorized\nrepresentative may represent. Prior to implementing that limit, a social\nservices district must identify the circumstances under which the limit will be\nimposed and submit such circumstances to this office for approval. (b) All applications shall be\nprocessed promptly. The date of application shall be the date of receipt by the\nsocial services official of a signed completed application on the\n\nState-prescribed form. While documentation is required for the determination of\neligibility, it shall not be a prerequisite to filing an application. (c) A personal interview with the applicant\nor a designated representative is required in all cases to establish\neligibility for public assistance. Interviews must ordinarily be scheduled\nwithin seven working days, except when there is indication of emergency need, in which case the interview must be held at once. The social services district\nmay allow an interview via telephone or other digital means at the request of\nthe applicant or recipient. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
