  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 383-8.4 - Receipt, inspection, and acceptance of waste\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Receipt of waste. (1)\n\nNo waste may be received at the land\ndisposal facility until: (i) the department\nreceives from the permittee the construction certification reports required by\nsection\n383-7.2\n(f) of this\n\nPart for those major phases of construction that must be completed for\noperation of the facility, as defined in the permit; (ii)\nthe department inspects the facility, finds it to be in conformance with the permit, and so notifies the permittee in\nwriting; (iii)\nall facility\npersonnel have successfully completed their initial training in accordance with\nthe personnel training program required by section 383- 3.4(a)(2)(iii) of this\n\nPart and the site safety and emergency response plan as required by section\n383-12.2\n(b)(11)\nof\nthis Part; and\n(iv)\nthe financial\nassurance instruments or methods included in the permit are in full force and\neffect. (2)\n\nThe\npermittee must receive waste in a designated receiving area physically\nseparated from other on-site activities to prevent the mixing of such waste\nwith waste that has been accepted for disposal. (3)\n\nThe permittee must develop and implement\nprocedures for scheduling, at least 24 hours in advance, the receipt of waste\nshipments at the land disposal facility. When any shipment or part of a\nshipment has not been received within 24 hours after the scheduled time of\nreceipt, the permittee must immediately notify the department and the\nradioactive materials licensee who last possessed the waste. (4)\n\nWaste shipments must be accompanied by a\ncomplete and valid manifest as required by Part 381 of this Title. Waste\ntransporters must possess a valid permit as required by Part 381 of this\n\nTitle. (5)\n\nAfter receipt, and prior\nto acceptance of a waste shipment, the permittee must verify by visual\ninspection that all portions of the manifest, except that portion to be filled\nout by the permittee, are complete and that the number of waste packages, the\nidentification on the waste packages (manifest number and waste\nclassification), and the description of the waste packages correspond to the\ninformation contained on the manifest. (6)\n\nAll discrepancies between the waste items\nlisted on the manifest and the items received must be noted on the manifest. Missing items must be reported as required by paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision. If the discrepancies cannot be resolved within 15 days after\nreceiving the shipment, the permittee must notify the department, in writing, and include a copy of the manifest and all continuation sheets (with\nnotations). If the discrepancies cannot be resolved within 30 days after\nreceiving the shipment, the permittee must cause the waste to be returned to\nthe generator or broker, unless the department directs otherwise. (7)\n\nThe permittee must maintain copies of\nmanifests as required by section 383- 13.2 of this Part. (b) Inspection and testing of waste. (1)\n\nThe permittee must develop and implement\na waste inspection and testing program designed and implemented to provide: (i) an effective deterrent to the shipment of\nunacceptable waste to the land disposal facility; and\n(ii)\nreasonable assurance that waste accepted\nfor disposal meets the requirements of the permit, this Part, and Parts 381 and\n382 of this Title. (2)\n\nThe waste inspection and testing program must include the surveying of all\nwaste packages with appropriate radiation detection instruments to detect\nsurface contamination and to measure radiation levels. (3)\n\nThe waste inspection and testing program\nmust include the X-raying of all Class A waste packages, except those in casks, to detect waste and waste forms that are not in compliance with this Part and\n\nPart 382 of this Title. The permittee must videotape all X-ray inspections and\nretain all videotapes as required by section\n383-13.2\nof this Part. (4)\n\nThe waste inspection and testing program\nmust include the following procedures: (i) monitoring, sampling, and analysis of waste packages selected as required by\nparagraph (5) of this subdivision, to verify the information presented on the\nmanifest and to determine compliance with the applicable requirements of this\n\nTitle and the permit; and\n(ii)\nother, nondestructive testing and inspection methods to be applied to waste\npackages selected as required by paragraph (5) of this subdivision. These may\ninclude measures such as comparing the weight of the waste package with the\nwaste description on the manifest, comparing waste characteristics with\ninformation about the generator's processes, and isotopic gamma analysis of\nexternal radiation fields. (5)\n\nThe procedures described in paragraph (4)\nof this subdivision must be selected and applied to waste received, as\nappropriate for the waste, considering its class, form, packaging, and any\nother relevant characteristics and the requirement in section\n382.13\nof this Title to keep\nradiation exposures during operation as low as reasonably achievable. (6)\n\nAt least one of the procedures described\nin paragraph (4) of this subdivision must be applied to waste received at the\nland disposal facility, at the following frequency: (i) one waste package from at least one\nshipment in any week during which waste is received; (ii)\none waste package from at least one out\nof every five shipments received; (iii)\none waste package from each shipment\nreceived from any person who has shipped unacceptable waste to the land\ndisposal facility within the past 12 months; (iv)\none waste package from each of the next\nthree shipments received from any person who ships unacceptable waste to the\nland disposal facility. (c) Acceptance of waste. (1)\n\nThe permittee must not accept waste for\ndisposal unless it is authorized by the permit to accept such waste, it has\nadequate treatment, storage, and disposal capacity available, and the following\ncriteria are met: (i) The waste package must\nbe clearly labeled to identify whether the waste is Class A, Class B, or Class\nC. Waste packages containing mixed waste must be clearly labeled as required by\n\nPart 372 of this Title. Waste packages must be clearly labeled to identify the\nradionuclides and their activity. Waste packages containing special nuclear\nmaterial must be labeled as such. (ii)\n\nThe waste must conform to the\ninformation set forth on the manifest accompanying the waste\nshipment. (iii)\n\nThe waste package\nmust be in compliance with all applicable State and Federal regulations for the\ntransport of radioactive material and hazardous wastes including Parts 364, 372, 381, and 382 of this Title. (iv)\n\nWaste must meet the requirements of\nsection\n382.81\nof this Title, unless the\npermittee, in accepting the waste for disposal, agrees to treat and/or\nrepackage it to meet the requirements of section\n382.81\nof this Title. (v) Waste containing iodine-129 must be\naccompanied by the results of analyses authorized by the department that were\nperformed to determine the activity of iodine-129 contained in the\nwaste. (vi)\n\nFor the disposal of\nwaste authorized by the department in accordance with section\n382.83\nof this Title, the waste\nmeets the requirements of that authorization. (2)\n\nOnly waste containing or contaminated\nwith radioactive material may be disposed of in disposal units at the land\ndisposal facility. (3)\n\nAt the time\na shipment or any part of a shipment is accepted for disposal, the permittee\nmust date the manifest, sign the appropriate certification on the manifest, give one copy to the transporter, and obtain the remaining copies of the\nmanifest from the transporter.
