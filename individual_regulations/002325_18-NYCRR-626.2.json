(b) Any claims for reimbursement from any\nportion of a program or activity for which there is Federal participation which\nwere not fully reimbursed as claimed and which were properly made at the time\nthey were originally claimed may be reclaimed as expenses for which Federal\nparticipation is available if such claims were appropriate when originally\nsubmitted, provided the revised claim is timely and an adjustment to reduce the\noriginal claim is simultaneously submitted to the department. (c) Any claims for reimbursement for\nfederally reimbursed AFDC which are subsequently determined by the department\nto be reimbursable from, or for which reimbursement is actually received or\ncredited from, another program for which Federal participation could be\nreceived, shall be reduced in an amount equivalent to the amount determined by\nthe department to be due as a result of the availability of Federal\nparticipation. (d) Claims for\nreimbursement for federally reimbursed AFDC shall not be submitted if such\nclaims seek reimbursement at rates or amounts that are greater than otherwise\npermitted by the department.
