  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1.3 - Executive Order No. 3: Relating to sanitation inspections of restaurants by State agencies. [*]\nState Regulations\n\nThe Reorganization Study, conducted by the Secretary to the\n\nGovernor and his staff, has ascertained that sanitation inspections of\nrestaurants and other food service establishments are now being conducted by\nthree State departments-Health, Agriculture and Markets, and Labor. The Department of Health has general authority for\nrestaurant sanitation to protect the public from conditions that might spread\ndisease through food preparation and service. Inspections to assure restaurant\nsanitation are usually conducted by employees of local health agencies, with\nthe State Department of Health paying part of the costs and providing technical\nsupervision. The State Department of Agriculture and Markets conducts\nrestaurant sanitation inspections to protect the public against adulterated or\nsubstitute food products. The Department of Labor inspects restaurants to assure that\nadequate and reasonable protection is provided for the lives, health and safety\nof employees and the public. Each of these three departments has a reasonable and proper\ninterest in the management and operation of restaurants. The fact remains, however, that their sanitation inspections of restaurants routinely duplicate\none another. Clearly a situation in which three separate governmental agencies\nperform the same routine function in the same business establishment is neither\neconomically nor managerially justifiable. Therefore, in continuance of my intention to eliminate\nduplication in State procedures and activities, it is directed that the\nfollowing rearrangement of activities be instituted: (1)\n\nPublic health personnel will continue to\nconduct periodic sanitation inspections of restaurants and similar\nestablishments. The Commissioner of Health will certify to the Commissioner of\n\nAgriculture and Markets those geographic areas in which public health personnel\nconduct regular sanitation inspections. (2)\n\nThe Department of Agriculture and Markets\nwill continue to make sanitation inspections only in places where public health\npersonnel are not regularly conducting such inspections. (3)\n\nThe Department of Labor will discontinue\nmaking sanitation inspections of restaurants. (This will in no way, however, change the Department's responsibilities for regulating and enforcing proper\nlabor standards.)\n\nTo assure that sanitation inspections of restaurants are\ngoverned by a uniform set of standards, it is further directed that the rules\nand regulations of the Departments of Health, Agriculture and Markets, and\n\nLabor, as they apply to restaurant sanitation and the conduct of sanitation\ninspections, shall be brought into conformity with one another and embodied in\nthe State Sanitary Code. For the purpose of achieving uniformity, the\napplicable provisions of the Sanitary Code shall then be adopted by the\n\nDepartment of Agriculture and Markets and the Department of Labor. In order to protect the best interests of the public, of\nrestaurant proprietors, and of employees, alike, and to assure that required\nfunctions are performed most efficiently, it is desirable that, along with the\nrearrangement of activities, there be developed cooperative interdepartmental\nworking relationships. I have, therefore, instructed the heads of the\n\nDepartments of Health, Agriculture and Markets, and Labor to establish mutually\nacceptable procedures for the exchange of information obtained by personnel\nunder their direction in the course of routine restaurant inspection. Specifically, this would mean that: (1)\n\nRepresentatives of the Department of\n\nAgriculture and Markets making inspections of restaurants for food adulteration\nand use of substitute food products would note and report, for the use of the\n\nDepartment of Health, any conditions observed that may be inconsistent with the\nsanitary regulations. (2)\n\nPublic\nhealth personnel observing evidence of the use of food substitutes or the\nadulteration of foods, while making routine sanitation inspections, would note\nand report such instances for the use of the Department of Agriculture and\n\nMarkets. This system would eliminate unnecessary duplication and\noverlap in restaurant sanitation inspections and provide for a free exchange of\ninformation. As a result, the inspectional staffs would concentrate on matters\nin which they have a primary and appropriate interest and they would achieve\nbetter coverage of their areas of inspection. It will also help eliminate\nconfusion and misunderstanding on the part of restaurant proprietors and\nemployees. Signed: Nelson A.
