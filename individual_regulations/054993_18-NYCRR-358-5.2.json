  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 358-5.2 - Scheduling\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The fair\nhearing will be held at a time and place convenient to the appellant as far as\npracticable. In scheduling the hearing, OAH will consider such things as the\nphysical inability of the appellant to travel to the regular hearing\nlocation. (b) Priority scheduling. (1)\n\nExcept as set forth in paragraph (4) of\nthis subdivision, a fair hearing which is subject to priority processing\npursuant to section\n358-3.2\nof this Part must be\nscheduled as soon as practicable after the request therefor is made. In\ndetermining the date for which the hearing will be scheduled, consideration\nmust be given to the nature and urgency of the appellant's situation, including\nany date before which the decision must be issued to allow for meaningful\nresolution of the issue under review. (2)\n\nWhen a hearing is requested concerning\nfood stamp benefits and the food stamp household intends to move from the local\nsocial services district before the decision normally would be issued, priority\nwill be given to the scheduling of the hearing, taking into account any date\nbefore which the hearing must be scheduled to allow for the appellant to\nreceive the decision while still in the district. (3)\n\nExcept as set forth in paragraph (4) of\nthis subdivision, after a hearing which was scheduled on a priority basis as\nset forth above, the decision must be issued as soon as practicable. In\ndetermining the date by which the decision will be issued, consideration must\nbe given to the nature and urgency of the appellant's situation, including any\ndate before which the decision must be issued to allow for meaningful\nresolution of the issue under review. If, at the conclusion of a hearing which\nwas scheduled on a priority basis, the hearing officer determines that the\nissues do not warrant continued priority processing, the hearing officer will\ninform the parties that the issuance of the decision will not receive priority\nprocessing. (4)\n\nWhen a fair hearing\nis requested concerning the involuntary discharge of a resident of a tier II\nfacility after such resident requests and participates in a hearing, held by\nthe facility or the social services district in which the facility is located, such fair hearing must be scheduled within seven working days of the request. The decision after the fair hearing must be issued within seven working days of\nthe date of the fair hearing. (c) When a hearing is requested pursuant to\nsection\n358-3.1\n(g) of\nthis Part or has been given priority in accordance with section\n358-3.2\n(d) of\nthis Part, the hearing will be held within 30 days of the request, unless\ndelayed by, or adjourned at the request of, the appellant.
