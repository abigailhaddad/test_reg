Tit. 17 § 919.3 - Establishment of private rail crossings; approvals\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The establishment of any new private rail\ncrossing in an intercity rail passenger service corridor requires a hearing and\napproval of the commissioner. After application is made for such a crossing, the commissioner shall hold a hearing to determine if a new private rail\ncrossing is justified or if an existing public or private rail crossing can be\nused to avoid creation of a new crossing. If a new private rail crossing is\nfound to be justified, the commissioner shall determine the following: (1)\nmanner of crossing (either at-grade or\ngrade separated); (2)\nlocation; (3)\ntype of warning\ndevices required; and\n(4)\napportionment of responsibility for cost and maintenance of the new rail\ncrossing including any warning devices required. (b) Installation and maintenance of warning\ndevices may be made a requirement by the commissioner for any new private rail\ncrossing established in an intercity rail passenger service corridor. (c) Application for the establishment of a\nnew private rail crossing or for the closure or alteration of an existing\nprivate rail crossing shall include plans, specifications and other documents\nas may be deemed necessary by the commissioner for the commissioner's review\nand written approval. All warning devices shall be in conformance with all\napplicable Federal, State and railroad standards. (d) The establishment of a new private rail\ncrossing in an intercity rail passenger service corridor to be used temporarily\nfor construction or related purposes shall require a hearing only if determined\nnecessary by the commissioner. If found to be necessary, all provisions of this\nsection shall apply to the proposed private rail crossing. If a hearing is\ndetermined not to be necessary, then the provisions of paragraphs (a)(1), (2), (3) and (4) of this section, as well as subdivisions (c) and (e) of this\nsection shall apply. (e) If a new\nprivate rail crossing is found not to be justified and an application therefor\nis denied by the commissioner, all known aggrieved parties will be notified in\nwriting by first class mail by commissioner no later than 60 days after such\nadverse decision. The decision of denial shall specify the exact reasons for\ndenial of the application for establishment of a new private rail\ncrossing. (f) Parties may appeal an\nadverse decision to the commissioner. Upon a determination that closure, alteration or creation of a new private rail crossing is found to be justified; plans, specifications and any other documents deemed necessary shall be\nsubmitted to the commissioner for review and approval before any work is\ninitiated\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
