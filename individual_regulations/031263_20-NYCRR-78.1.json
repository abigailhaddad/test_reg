  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 78.1 - Failure to file a return or to pay the tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 481(1)(a)(i)\n(a) An agent who or which fails to file a\nreturn or fails to pay any tax due on or before the last date prescribed for\nfiling or paying, unless it can be shown that such failure was due to\nreasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, is subject to a penalty: (1)\nof 10 percent of the amount of tax\ndetermined to be due pursuant to article 20 of the Tax Law, for the first month\nor any fraction thereof succeeding the last date prescribed for filing or\npaying; plus\n(2)\nan additional one\npercent of the amount of tax determined to be due pursuant to such article, for\neach additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues\nafter the expiration of the first month after such return was required to be\nfiled or such tax became due. The initial 10 percent and the additional one percent per\nmonth may not exceed 30 percent in the aggregate. Thus penalty may accrue for a\nperiod of 21 months. (b) If the tax on cigarettes imposed by\narticle 20 of the Tax Law is not paid on or before the last date prescribed for\npayment, the person (other than an agent) liable for the payment of such tax, unless it can be shown that such failure was due to reasonable cause and not\ndue to willful neglect, is subject to a penalty: (1)\nof 50 percent of the amount of tax\ndetermined to be due pursuant to article 20 of the Tax Law, for the first month\nor any fraction thereof succeeding the last date prescribed for filing or\npaying; plus\n(2)\nan additional one\npercent of the amount of tax determined to be due pursuant to such article, for\neach additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues\nafter the expiration of the first month. (c) The amount of tax determined to be due\nincludes those stamps required for the period and will be reduced by the amount\nof any part of the tax which is paid, including stamps affixed and cancelled, on or before the date prescribed for payment and by the amount of any credits\nagainst the tax which may be claimed on the return whether or not they were in\nfact claimed. Where an agent has purchased stamps and the Commissioner of\n\nTaxation and Finance has permitted the agent to pay for such stamps within 30\ndays after the date of purchase in accordance with section\n472\nof the Tax Law, the amount of tax\ndetermined to be due will also include any amounts outstanding beyond the 30th\nday. Further, in computing the additional one percent per month, the amount of\ntax determined to be due will be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax\nwhich is paid before the first day of each month. For purposes of this section, a month constitutes a period which terminates in each calendar month with the\ndate numerically corresponding to the prescribed due date. Where an agent fails\nto both timely file a return and timely pay any tax due, separate penalties for\nthe failure to file and the failure to pay are not imposed. (d) Where a return is filed later than 60\ndays after the last date prescribed for filing, unless it can be shown that\nsuch failure was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the\npenalty imposed by this section for failure to file may not be less than\n$100.00 or 100 percent of the amount of tax required to be shown on the return, whichever is the lower amount. For purposes of this subdivision, the amount of\ntax required to be shown on the return will be reduced by the amount of any\npart of the tax which is paid on or before the date prescribed for payment of\nthe tax and by the amount of any credits against the tax which may be claimed\nupon the return whether or not they were in fact claimed. Example: An agent cigarette tax return for January, due February\n15th, is filed on June 20th. On audit it is determined that the discrepancy\nbetween the stamps required for the period and the stamps used for the period\ncannot be satisfactorily explained. The amount of tax required to be shown on\nthe return based on an understamping is $200.00, of which $100.00 was paid on\n\nJune 5th and the balance on June 20th. The penalty imposed is computed as\nfollows: February 16th through March 15th-$200 at 10%\n$20.00\n\nMarch 16th through April 15th-$200 at 1% 2.00\n\nApril 16th through May 15th-$200 at 1% 2.00\n\nMay 16th through June 15th-$200 at 1% 2.00\n\nJune 16th through June 20th-$100 at 1% 1.00\n\nTotal $27.00\n\nSince the return was not filed within 60 days of the due\ndate, the penalty may not be less than the lesser of $100 or 100 percent of\n$200. Accordingly, a $100 penalty is due. (e) The penalties pursuant to this section\nshall be determined, assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as the\ntaxes imposed by article 20 of the Tax Law. Provided however, such penalties\nshall not be paid by the use of stamps. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
