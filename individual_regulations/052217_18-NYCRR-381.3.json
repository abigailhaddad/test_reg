  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 381.3 - Restrictions on money payments\n\nState Regulations\n\nMoney payments shall be restricted under the following\ncircumstances: (a) Restriction based\non inability to handle cash. When the inability of an applicant for, or\nrecipient of, ADC to handle cash has been demonstrated and when neither the\ngranting of power of attorney by the recipient nor the appointment of a\ncommittee by the court is deemed practicable, payment of all or part of the\ngrant shall be made by restricted payments. The recipient shall be sent written\nnotice whenever a creditor requests a restricted payment for mismanagement on\nthe basis of nonpayment of bills. Where payment is restricted, the reason for\nthe decision to restrict shall be explained in the case record and the\nrecipient shall be sent written notice of the restriction together with the\nreasons pertaining thereto. The recipient shall be sent written notice of any\ndecision not to use a restricted payment. The local social services district\nshall initiate discussion concerning the client's reasons for nonpayment of\nbills and shall make renewed effort to help the client assume responsibility\nfor paying his own bills. (b) When\nan applicant/recipient of ADC requests in writing that vendor or protective\npayment be made in instances where the budget deficit is greater than or equal\nto the charge for the goods or services rendered or greater than or equal to\nthe maximum amounts set forth in section\n352.29\n(e) of this\n\nTitle in those cases where the requested vendor payment is for a heat and/or\ndomestic energy bill. (c) Public\nassistance must be granted in cash; provided, however, that when the granting\nof cash may be deemed inappropriate by the social services district because of\none of the following situations, public assistance may be granted in whole or\nin part by restricted payment: (1)\nan\napplicant or recipient has demonstrated an inability to manage funds; (2)\nless expensive or more easily controlled\nalternative methods of payment are available; (3)\nwhen vendor payments are made to\nlandlords on behalf of individuals residing in public housing; or\n(4)\nan applicant or recipient requests\nrestricted payments. (d) Restricted payments for rent. When a recipient of public assistance has failed\nto fully apply the shelter allowance to his rent, the social services official\nshall consider such failure as an indication of inability to handle cash and\nshall investigate the advisability of making restricted payment of the shelter\nallowance directly to the landlord or his designated agent. In determining\nwhether such restricted payments shall be made, the following considerations\nshall apply: (1)\n\nTwo months nonpayment of the\nshelter allowance or eviction notice for nonpayment of rent shall be considered\nrebuttable presumptive evidence of inability to handle cash. Examples of how\nthis presumption may be rebutted include, but are not limited to: (i) where a recipient demonstrates that the\nfamily has experienced some emergency or extraordinary event for which it was\nappropriate for available funds to be spent; (ii)\nwhere a recipient demonstrates\nextraordinary expenses for necessary items not normally provided for by the\npublic assistance grant or by the medical assistance program or for which\npayment is not readily available from some other source; or\n(iii)\nwhere a recipient demonstrates that the\nfamily has withheld the payment of rent as a reasonable exercise of consumer\nrights. (2)\n\nWhen a\nrecipient is two months or more in rent arrears, and the landlord or his\ndesignated agent desires restricted payment for rent, the landlord or his\ndesignated agent must make such request in writing to the local social services\nofficial. Prior to making such written request, the landlord or his designated\nagent shall attempt to collect the overdue rent from the recipient and shall\nprovide such evidence to the social services official when the written request\nis made. (3)\n\nSuch payment shall not\nbe made where a recipient's rent is in excess of the amount allowed as a\nshelter allowance and the recipient pays the full amount of such allowance but\nfails to pay part or all of the amount due above the allowance, nor shall such\npayments be made where the social services official has been withholding rent\npayments in accordance with the provisions of section\n143-b\nof\nthe Social Services Law. (4)\n\nThe\nsocial services official shall advise the recipient whenever a landlord or his\ndesignated agent requests restricted rent payments. (5)\n\nThe social services official shall advise\nthe recipient of the decision to restrict rent by means of a timely and\nadequate notice detailing the reasons for the proposed action or shall advise\nthe recipient of a decision not to restrict rent. (6)\n\nWhen a decision to make restricted\npayments for rent is made pursuant to this subdivision, the decision shall be\nentered in the case record and the reasons underlying the decision shall be\nfully documented. (e) Payments in closed cases. (1)\n\nPublic\nassistance payments are to be made only to persons who are current recipients\nof public assistance and care on the date of payment, except as provided below: (i) payment must be made to former applicants\nfor and recipients of ADC whose cases have been closed and who are owed ADC\nbenefits for periods after July 1, 1985 if such benefits are owed solely\nbecause such persons are not current recipients of ADC and: (a) such benefits are: (1)\nrequested by the former applicant or\nrecipient or the appropriate social services district is otherwise informed\nthat such payments are owed; and\n(2)\nnot in dispute and are acknowledged as\nbenefits owed to the former applicant or recipient by the social services\ndistrict; or\n(b) such\nbenefits have been established as owed to the former applicant or recipient as\na result of a fair hearing requested pursuant to section\n358-3.5\nof this Title; (ii)\npayment must be made on\nbehalf of closed public assistance cases when an obligation has been authorized\nprior to an applicant's or recipient's death or prior to the date of closing of\na public assistance case if the social services district is required to pay the\ncost or unpaid balance of the obligation to a vendor. Payment on behalf of a\nclosed public assistance case under this subparagraph must be by vendor\npayment; or\n(iii)\npayment must be\nmade to former applicants for and recipients of public assistance whose cases\nhave been closed for energy reconciliation payments, as authorized by section\n352.5\nof this Title, payments for\nnet loss of cash income as authorized by section\n352.7\n(m) of this\n\nTitle, payments for extended supportive services as authorized by section\n385.3\n(d) of this\n\nTitle, replacement payments for lost or stolen checks as authorized by section\n352.7\n(g)(1)\nof\nthis Title or replacement payments for voided checks when such applicants or\nrecipients are eligible for such payments. (2)\n\nSupport pass-through payments, as\nauthorized by section\n352.15\nof this Title, and burial\npayments, as authorized by sections\n352.7\n(n) and\n620.3\n(a) of this\n\nTitle, may be made in closed cases.
