(4)\n\nApproved petitions will be subject to\nconditions the department deems necessary to prevent adverse environmental\nimpacts. When granting a beneficial use determination, the department will\ndetermine the precise point at which the waste ceases to be waste. Unless\notherwise determined by the department, that point occurs when it is received\nfor use in a manufacturing process, or for use as an effective substitute for a\ncommercial product or raw material. (5)\n\nThe department may modify, suspend, or\nrevoke any determination made under this section, upon notice and an\nopportunity to be heard, if it finds that one or more of the factors serving as\nthe basis for the department's determination were incorrect or are no longer\nvalid, that there has been noncompliance with any condition attached to the\ndetermination, or if necessary to prevent adverse impacts to public health and\nthe environment, or control nuisances. (6)\n\nProcessing and review of a petition will\nbe suspended if an enforcement action has been commenced against the petitioner\nfor alleged violations of the ECL or other environmental laws administered by\nthe department at the facility or site that is the subject of the\npetition. (7)\n\nAn approved\ncase-specific beneficial use determination is valid for no more than five years\nfrom the date of approval. Case-specific beneficial use determinations may be\nrenewed upon review and approval of the department. A renewal is not required\nfor case-specific beneficial use determination of a time-limited or\nquantity-limited nature wherein work is completed and no additional waste is\nproposed or approved for beneficial use. (8)\n\nBy March 1 following each calendar year\nof approval, the petitioners of an approved case-specific beneficial use\ndeterminations must submit a report to the department, on a form acceptable to\nthe department that includes the quantity of waste beneficially used during the\nprevious calendar year of operation and any analytical data or other\ninformation required in the approved case-specific beneficial use\ndetermination. The report must also contain a signed statement by a responsible\nofficial of the petitioner's organization that the organization has been in\ncompliance with the terms and conditions of the approved case-specific\nbeneficial use determination during the reporting period.

For all uses, if the criterion for beneficial use is lower than the laboratory reporting\nlimit, an analytical result less than the reporting limit will be considered to\ncomply with the criterion. ** lower concentrations may be considered when brine is\nused for dust control or road stabilization. (iv)\n\nMethods must be employed at the well\nsite to minimize the amount of hydrocarbons present in the brine. (v) Brine application within 50 feet of a\nstream, creek, lake, or other body of water is prohibited.
