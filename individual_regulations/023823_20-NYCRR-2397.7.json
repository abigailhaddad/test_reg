  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2397.7 - Mailing rules; reasonable cause\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Mailing rules. (1)\nACH debit, ACH credit and\nfedwire taxpayers. The mailing rules specified in sections\n289-d, 315\nand\n1147\nof the Tax Law and in regulations\npromulgated thereunder shall not be applicable to payments made by taxpayers\nelecting the ACH debit, ACH credit or fedwire payment option. Such taxpayers\nshall be deemed to have timely made their payment of tax when the department's\ndepository bank receives the payment of tax on or before the applicable due\ndate. (2)\n\nCertified check\ntaxpayers. The mailing rules specified in sections\n289-d, 315\nand\n1147\nof the Tax Law and regulations\npromulgated thereunder shall be applicable to payments made by taxpayers\nelecting the certified check payment option and mailing such certified checks\nand accompanying completed transmittal forms to the department's depository\nbank, subject to the proviso that the taxpayer must mail its certified check\nfor the tax liability on or before the second business day prior to the\napplicable due date. (b) (1)\n\nIn the event that the penalty or\npenalties described in subdivision (g) of section\n10\nof the Tax Law have been imposed and it is\nlater determined that any such failure was due to reasonable cause and not due\nto willful neglect, all of such penalties shall be waived, and in the case of\ninterest imposed with respect to the sales and use taxes required to be\nremitted by electronic funds transfer pursuant to section\n10\nof the Tax Law, that portion of the\ninterest that exceeds the amount that would be payable if such interest were\ncomputed at the rate set by the commissioner pursuant to section\n1142 (9)\nof the Tax Law\n(see Part 2393 of this Title) shall also be waived. The absence of willful\nneglect alone is not sufficient grounds for not imposing or for cancelling such\npenalty or penalties, and interest. (2)\n\nAll of the facts alleged as a basis for\nreasonable cause and absence of willful neglect may be required to be\naffirmatively shown in a written statement made by the taxpayer against whom\nthe penalty or penalties have been assessed or are assessable. Where the\ntaxpayer is unable to provide such statement or does not have personal\nknowledge of such facts, a showing of reasonable cause and absence of willful\nneglect may be made on behalf of the taxpayer by an individual with personal\nknowledge of such facts. In determining whether reasonable cause exists, in\naddition to an evaluation of such facts, the taxpayer's previous compliance\nrecord with respect to all of the taxes imposed pursuant to the Tax Law may be\ntaken into account. (3)\n\nGrounds for\nreasonable cause. The following exemplify grounds for reasonable cause and\nabsence of willful neglect, where clearly established by or on behalf of the\ntaxpayer: (i) taxpayer inability to access the\nelectronic payment reporting system on the required due date because of a\nsystems failure beyond the taxpayer's control (i.e., a failure in the\nelectronic payment reporting system); (ii)\ndepartment or department depository bank\nsystems failure preventing proper receipt of a payment of tax; (iii)\ntaxpayer inability to timely complete a\nprogram transaction, due to any other circumstances beyond its control, but\nonly if all possible remedial action is immediately initiated; or\n(iv)\nthe circumstances set forth in section\n2392.1\nof this\n\nTitle, as applicable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n2397.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
