Tit. 10 §§ 69-3.5 - Responsibilities of the health care providers attending newborn children\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Health care providers attending newborn children of a woman with a positive HBsAg test result shall offer or cause to be offered immunizing doses of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin for each such newborn child within 12 hours of birth unless a licensed physician or health care practitioner practicing under the supervision of a licensed physician determines that the child is not physiologically stable to permit immunization. In such cases the hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin shall be administered when the child becomes physiologically stable to permit immunization. (b) Health care providers attending newborn children of a pregnant woman admitted for delivery without a HBsAg test result available shall offer or cause to be offered immunizing doses of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin for each such newborn child immediately upon receiving a blood test result showing that the woman has a positive HBsAg test. (c) If a woman's HBsAg test result is not available and her newborn child is to be discharged from the health care facility or 48 hours has elapsed since birth and if, in the health care provider's medical judgement the mother has a reasonable likelihood of being positive for HBsAg, the provider shall offer or cause to be offered for such a newborn child, immunizing doses of hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin. (d) After administering hepatitis B vaccine or hepatitis B immune globulin to a newborn child, the health care provider shall record in the child's medical record the date and time of immunization and the dosage, the manufacturer's lot number and the sites of injection for hepatitis B vaccine and hepatitis B immune globulin and shall provide the woman with a certificate of immunization for her child stating the immunizing agents administered and the dates of administration.
