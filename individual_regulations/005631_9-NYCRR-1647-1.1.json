  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1647-1.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part deals\nwith specific accounting procedures and instructions applicable to the\noperating period, except with respect to subsidies, which will be separately\ntreated in Part 1648. (b) The\noperating period has been defined in Part 1640 as beginning with the date of\nsubstantial completion. The significance of the date of substantial completion\nin the scheme of accounts has been indicated previously. To recapitulate, the\ndate of substantial completion marks the point at which direct costs and\ncarrying charges cease to be capitalized as development costs and commence to\nbe charged to project revenues; it marks the end of the initial operating\nperiod and, hence, of the capitalization of the net income or deficit for that\nperiod; it marks the point at which the local agency begins to record, formally, vacancies for the project proper and to make provisions for reserves\nfor vacancy and collection losses, painting and decorating, and replacements; it marks the point at which, if bonds have been issued, the local agency begins\nto make provision for amortization of the bond issue; it marks the point at\nwhich periodic subsidies (State and local) begin to accrue. Other accounting\nfeatures of the operating period stem from the requirement (as contrasted with\nthe development period) to close the books at the end of each fiscal year and\nthe related requirement for the operation of account 2700, Income and Expense\n\nClearance, and account 2710, Prior Years Adjustments. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1647-1.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
