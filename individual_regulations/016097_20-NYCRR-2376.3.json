  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2376.3 - Procedure after the filing of a petition for advisory opinion\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If the division determines that a\npetition for advisory opinion is not complete, the petitioner will be notified\nof the nature of the petition's defects. The petitioner may then revise and\nresubmit the petition. The time within which an advisory opinion must be issued\nwill start to run from the date of receipt of a complete petition for advisory\nopinion. If the notice to petitioner indicates that the petition has been\ndeemed defective by virtue of a statement of facts that is unclear, incomplete, or insufficient to permit an opinion to be rendered, the petitioner has 30\ncalendar days from the date of the notice to provide the requested information, unless an extension of time is granted. If the department does not receive the\nrequested information by the time it is due, the petition will be considered to\nbe withdrawn. (b) In addition, the\n\nDivision of Taxation's Audit Division will review the petition and may prepare\na statement indicating that it disagrees with the petitioner's description of\nthe facts. The division will notify the petitioner of the Audit Division's\ndisagreement and the petitioner may submit a reply thereto within 30 days of\nreceipt. The time to file such reply may be extended upon request of the\npetitioner. The petitioner may submit further statements during the course of\nthe division's consideration of the petition for advisory opinion. In each such\ninstance the Audit Division may prepare a comment. The division will notify the\npetitioner and the petitioner will be afforded an opportunity to submit a reply\nin the same manner as that described above. Any additional submission by the\npetitioner will be deemed a modification of the petition and the period within\nwhich an advisory opinion must be issued will begin to run anew from the date\nthe additional information is received. (c) Conferences. If the division determines\nthat a conference with the petitioner would be useful, a conference will be\narranged, by telephone if possible, in such a manner as to cause the petitioner\nthe least possible inconvenience. A petitioner may request a conference, but\nthe scheduling of conferences is at the division's sole discretion. Once a\nconference has been scheduled, a petitioner may request that the division\npostpone the conference. The granting of a postponement extends the time within\nwhich the advisory opinion must be issued. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
