  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 415.4 - Local district responsibility\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach local social services district shall be responsible\nfor compliance with the following requirements: (a) Initial eligibility. (1)\n\nAt the time of application for child care\nservices, the social services district must inform the applicant of: (i) the various child care services programs\navailable and the requirements of the child care services programs for which\nthe applicant may be eligible including information about the child care\nguarantee for applicants and recipients of public assistance and for families\ntransitioning from public assistance set forth in section\n410-w\n(3)\nof the Social Services Law. Such\ninformation must describe the actions that the family needs to take in order to\nbe eligible for the child care guarantee; (ii)\nthe applicant's responsibility for\nreporting all relevant facts to the social services district in order that a\nproper determination of the applicant's eligibility for child care assistance\ncan be made, for reporting immediately to the social services district any\nchanges to such facts after the application has been submitted but before\neligibility has been determined, and for providing the documents or other\ninformation which the applicant must submit to verify such facts; (iii)\nthe fact that any investigation needed\nin order to determine the applicant's eligibility will be undertaken; (iv)\na recipient's responsibility for\nnotifying the social services district immediately of any change in financial\ncircumstances that puts the family income over 85 percent of the state median\nincome, living arrangements, employment, household composition, child care\nprovider or other circumstances that affect the family's need or eligibility\nfor child care services; (v) a\nrecipient's responsibility to contribute toward the costs of the child care\nservices by paying a family share, if required as determined in accordance with\nsection\n415.3\n(e) of this\n\nPart; (vi)\nthe child care providers\nwith which the social services district has arrangements for the provision of\nchild care services to recipients; (vii)\na recipient's option to choose between\nthe eligible providers set forth in section\n415.1\n(g) of this\n\nPart; (viii)\na recipient's\nresponsibility to locate child care. In addition, a public assistance recipient\nwho needs child care in order to comply with his or her work requirements must\nbe notified of the provisions in section\n415.8\nof this Part regarding the\nrecipient's responsibility to locate child care and to inform the district of\nthe recipient's efforts to locate child care including following up on\nreferrals from the district, the applicable local child care resource and\nreferral agency and/or any other child care agency to which the recipient is\nreferred by the district; (ix)\ninformation to assist a recipient to make an informed choice regarding the\nprovider from which the recipient wishes to receive child care services; and\n(x) a recipient's right to have\nchild care services provided without discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, sex, handicapping condition or political\nbelief. (2)\n\nAll\napplications for child care assistance must be processed promptly. A\ndetermination of programmatic and financial eligibility must be completed\nwithin the time-frame set forth in section\n404.1\n(d) of this\n\nTitle except where the applicant requests additional time, where difficulties\nin verifying eligibility lead to a delay or where other reasons beyond the\nsocial services district's control lead to a delay. The reason for a delay in\nmaking such determination must be recorded in the case record and communicated\nto the applicant. (3)\n\nInitial\neligibility for child care assistance must be determined pursuant to the\nrequirements of this Part, Part 404 of this Title and, where applicable, Part\n385 of this Title. In addition, required documentation is a necessary\nprerequisite to the determination of eligibility and must be\nretained. (4)\n\nIf an application for\nchild care assistance is approved, the social services district must send\nwritten notice to the applicant for child care services, in accordance with\nsection\n404.1\n(f) of this\n\nTitle. The notice must include: the determination of eligibility for child care\nservices; the family share to be paid by the applicant, if required; the\neffective date(s) of such family share and the family share payment procedures\nwhich must be followed; the period for which child care assistance is\nauthorized; the name of the worker or unit responsible for case management and\nthe telephone number; a statement regarding the continuing responsibility of\nthe applicant or recipient to report any change in his or her status that would\nimpact their continued eligibility; the right of the recipient to accept or\nreject the service; and the applicant's right to a fair hearing in accordance\nwith Part 358 and section\n404.1\n(f) of this\n\nTitle.

(b) Continuing eligibility. (1)\n\nContinuing eligibility for child care services must be redetermined every 12\nmonths, or 24 months for cases funded under the New York State Child Care Block\n\nGrant if the district opts in its Child and Family Services Plan to authorize\nchild care assistance for 24 months, and when case factors indicate that\nredetermination could be beneficial to the family by reducing family share or\nincreasing the amount of child care assistance; provided, however, that a\nsocial services district may not require the submission of a new application\nmerely because the applicant is no longer eligible for public assistance or no\nlonger eligible for a child care guarantee. The district must establish\nprocedures to enable families to keep their child care services without\ninterruption as long as the families remain eligible for such services\nincluding procedures to transfer families from one unit of the district to\nanother when necessary. (2)\n\nAll\nfactors concerning need and eligibility for child care services must be\nreconsidered, reevaluated and verified during redeterminations. The periodic\nredeterminations conducted by the social services district do not eliminate the\nresponsibility of a recipient of child care services to report to such district\nany change in financial circumstances that puts the family income over 85\npercent of the state median income, living arrangements, child care\narrangements, employment, household composition or other circumstances that\naffect the family's need or eligibility for child care services. (3)\n\nIf a recipient is redetermined to be\neligible for child care services, the social services district must send\nwritten notice to the recipient of the determination of eligibility for child\ncare services; the family share payment procedures which must be followed; and\nthe recipient's right to a fair hearing in accordance with Parts 358 and 404 of\nthis Title. (4)\n\nIf a recipient is\ndetermined to no longer be eligible for child care services, the social\nservices district must send written notice to the recipient of the\ndetermination of ineligibility and of the recipient's right to a fair hearing\nin accordance with Part 358 and section\n404.1\n(f) of this\n\nTitle. (c) Child\ncare services requirements. (1)\nA\nrecipient must have the option to choose between the eligible providers set\nforth in section\n415.1\n(g) of this\n\nPart; provided, however, that: (i) a\nrecipient may choose a provider of informal child care or a provider of\nlegally- exempt group child care only for child care services provided under\nthe New York State Child Care Block Grant Program; (ii)\na social services district may\ndisapprove a provider chosen by a recipient in a preventive or child protective\ncase if the district has reason to believe that it would be contrary to the\nhealth, safety or welfare of the child to receive child care services from that\nprovider; (iii)\na child care\nprovider chosen by a recipient must be validly licensed, properly registered or\nenrolled, as appropriate; and\n(iv)\na child care provider chosen by a recipient must permit a child's caretaker to\nhave: unlimited and on demand access to such child; the right to inspect, on\ndemand and at any time during the hours of operation of the home or facility, all parts of such home or facility used for child care or which could present a\nhazard to the health or safety of a child; unlimited and on demand access to\nthe provider(s) caring for such child whenever such child is in care and during\nthe normal hours of operation; and, unlimited and on demand access to written\nrecords concerning such child except where access to such records is otherwise\nrestricted by law. (2)\nA\nrecipient who chooses a caregiver of legally-exempt in-home child care who will\nbe providing such care in a child's own home must be advised of the recipient's\nresponsibility to provide such provider with all employment benefits required\nby State and/or Federal law and the recipient's responsibility to pay the\nprovider at least the minimum wage if required by State and/or Federal\nlaw. (3)\n\nThe child care services\nprovided must be reasonably related to the hours of employment, education or\ntraining of a child's caretaker, as applicable, and permit time for delivery\nand pick-up of the child. In the event the caretaker is no longer engaged in\ntheir approved activity during the eligibility period, the child care services\nmust continue unless the recipient family has experienced a non-temporary\ncessation in work or attendance at a training or education program or\nexperienced other circumstances set forth in 415.2(d)(4). Child care services\nmust be provided, if needed, to enable an employed caretaker who works\nnon-traditional hours to obtain up to eight hours of sleep if they have a child\nwho is under the age of 6 and not in school for a full day. Child care services\nmay be provided, if needed, to enable other employed caretakers who work\nnon-traditional hours to obtain up to eight hours of sleep if the social\nservices district indicates in its Child and Family Services Plan that it will\nprovide such services. (4)\n\nWhen\narranging child care services, the needs of the child must be taken into\naccount including: continuity of child care; reasonable proximity of the care\neither to the child's home and school or to the child's caretaker's place of\nemployment, education or training, as applicable; and, the appropriateness of\nthe child care to the child's age and special needs. (5)\n\nNo child may be moved by a social\nservices district from an existing placement with an eligible provider unless\nthe recipient of child care services consents to such move; provided, however, that a social services district may require that a child receiving child care\nservices as part of a preventive case or a child protective case be moved from\nan existing placement with an eligible provider if the district has reason to\nbelieve that it would be contrary to the child's health, safety or welfare to\ncontinue receiving child care services from that provider. (6)\nA current list of the licensed or\nregistered child day care providers located in the social services district\nmust be maintained and made available to applicants for and recipients of child\ncare services. (7)\n\nSocial services\ndistricts must inform public assistance recipients that: (i) the exemption from work requirements for\nlack of child care, if applicable, will not extend the time limitations on the\nreceipt of family assistance; and\n(ii)\nthe recipient will not be sanctioned for\nfailure to comply with work requirements as long as the recipient can\ndemonstrate an inability to find child care in accordance with section\n415.8\nof this Part. The\ninformation provided to the recipient must include the definitions and\nprocedures set forth in such section. (8)\nA social services district must notify\napplicants for and recipients of public assistance of the guarantee for child\ncare services and for transitional child care services available to applicants\nor recipients that choose child care services in lieu of public assistance. Recipients of public assistance also must be informed of their potential\neligibility for the guarantee for transitional child care services when their\npublic assistance benefits are terminated. Such notification must describe the\nactions an applicant or recipient must take to obtain the guaranteed\ntransitional child care services. A social services district may not require\nthat an applicant or recipient reapply to receive the guaranteed transitional\nchild care services as long as the family remains eligible for child care\nservices. (9)\n\nThe social services\ndistrict must take action on a claim for reimbursement for child care services\nsubmitted by an eligible provider as follows: (i) The social services district shall allow, disallow, or defer a claim for reimbursement, submitted by an eligible provider\nto the social services district, for the purpose of providing child care\nservices pursuant to this Part within 21 calendar days of receiving such\nclaim. (ii)\n\nThe social services\ndistrict may defer a claim for reimbursement only in the following\ncircumstances: (a) upon the recommendation of\na Federal, State, or local agency, when the agency has informed the social\nservices district that continued payments of such claims place the social\nservice district at risk of making payments for services that were not provided\nin accordance with the applicable State regulations; or\n(b) after an initial review of the claim by\nthe social services district revealed inaccuracies in the claim that warrant a\nmore detailed review; or\n(c) upon\nnotification of the existence of a pending criminal charge involving\nfraud. (iii)\n\nThe social\nservices district may disallow payment for claims for services provided to any\nand all children receiving a child care subsidy for the time period in which: (a) an enrolled provider is found by the\noffice to be operating or have operated a child care program, required to be\nlicensed or registered with the office, without obtaining such license or\nregistration; or\n(b) a licensed or\nregistered provider is found by the office to be operating or have operated\nover its licensed or registered capacity; or\n(c) an enrolled informal provider is found by\nthe office to be caring or have cared for more children than the limits defined\nin section\n415.1\n(h) of this\n\nPart. (d) Jurisdiction. (1)\n\nWhen a family in receipt of child care\nservices under the New York State Child Care Block Grant moves from one social\nservices district to another social services district within the State, the\nformer social services district is obligated to continue to pay for the\nauthorized child care services for the duration of the eligibility\nperiod. (2)\n\nFor cases funded under\n\nTitle XX, the social services district in which the family resides will be\nresponsible for child care services. (e) Administration. (1)\n\nIn the case of providers from whom or\nfrom which the social services district purchases child care services, contracts, when required by section\n405.3\nof this Title, will be\nnegotiated in accordance with the purchase of service requirements set forth in\nsuch section; provider budgets may be reviewed and attendance and payment\nrecords will be monitored. (2)\n\nRequired reports and claims for reimbursement must be prepared and submitted in\nthe form and manner and at the times as required by the office. (3)\n\nRecords required to be maintained by the\n\nState and Federal law and by instructions of the office must be retained as\nappropriate. Under this subdivision, local districts must keep and retain\nadequate claiming records, retain appropriate documentation in the recipient's\ncase file, and make appropriate records available for audit by appropriate\n\nState and Federal agencies. (4)\n\nSocial services districts may alter their participation in activities related\nto arranging for, subsidizing, delivering, and monitoring the provision of\nsubsidized child day care, provided that the total participation of an\nindividual district in all activities related to the provision of subsidized\nchild day care must be no less than the participation level engaged in by such\nindividual district on the effective date of this section, to be determined\nbased on a review of expenditures for the calendar year January 1, 1990 through\n\nDecember 31, 1990. (5)\n\nThe social\nservices district is responsible for reporting to the office, in the form and\nmanner and at the times required by the office, specific information regarding\nchild care services, including, but not limited to, the number of children\nreceiving each specific child care services, the costs of such services\nseparated by the type of child care providers used, and any additional\ninformation required for the State to meet Federal reporting\nrequirements. (6)\n\nEach social\nservices district must submit a child care services plan to the office for\napproval as part of the district's multi-year consolidated services plan or\nintegrated county plan and any annual implementation reports, in the form and\nmanner and at the times required by the office. A social services district must\nimplement its child care services programs in accordance with the child care\nservices plan approved by the office. (7)\n\nThe social services district that\nproposes an amendment to its Child and Family Services Plan that reduces\neligibility or increases the family share percentage for child care services\nmust: (i) no later than the first day the\npublic notice appears in a newspaper pursuant to section\n34-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law or the regulations of the office, as applicable, prominently post on the district's website a notice of the proposed amendment\ndescribing the categories of families whose cases will be impacted; and\n(ii)\nat the time the public\nnotice is submitted to the newspaper for publication, provide a copy of such\nnotice to the office. (8)\n\nThe social services district must provide written notice to families receiving\nchild care services at least 30 days in advance of the effective date of an\naction the district takes to: (i) implement a\nplan amendment to its Child and Family Services Plan that reduces the family's\neligibility for child care services; (ii)\nincrease the family share percentage; or\n(iii)\nimplement the process for\nclosing child care cases. (9)\n\nWhen a social services district\nimplements the process for closing child care cases for families, the district\nmust: (i) no later than the day the district\nbegins to send out the notices of intent to discontinue child care benefits, post a notice on its website, that states the district is implementing the\nchild care case closing process set forth in its approved Child and Family\n\nServices Plan and describes the categories of families who will be impacted; and\n(ii)\nimmediately provide a copy\nof the website notice to the office. (f) Actions related to legally-exempt\nchild care providers. (1)\n\nThe social\nservices district must provide a child's caretaker that has applied for or is\nreceiving child care assistance under the New York State Child Care Block Grant\n\nProgram and who is interested in using a legally-exempt child care provider\nwith an enrollment package and notify the caretaker that the completed package\nmust be submitted to the applicable enrollment agency. (2)\n\nIn accordance with guidelines issued by\nthe office, the social services district in which a relative-only in-home or\nrelative-only family child care provider lives must conduct a local child\nwelfare database check to determine whether such provider has had his or her\nparental rights terminated under section\n384-b\nof\nthe Social Services Law or had a child removed from his or her care by court\norder under article 10 of the Family Court Act; and\n(i) provide the enrollment agency with the\nresults of the local child welfare database check within 15 days of receiving\nthe request; and\n(ii)\nwhen\napplicable, conduct a review of extenuating circumstances and provide the\nenrollment agency with the results. (3)\nA social services district may only make\npayments for child care services provided by a legally-exempt child care\nprovider if the child care provider has been enrolled, either on a temporary or\nfinal basis, by an enrollment agency in accordance with this Part. (4)\nA social services district may suspend\nthe enrollment or deny the application for enrollment of a child care provider, which is not required to be licensed or registered under section\n390\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law, if that provider is a subject of a report of child abuse\nor maltreatment under investigation by child protective services. (5)\n\nChild care assistance cannot be\nauthorized for a child under three years of age for child care provided in a\nlegally-exempt group child care program, except for: (i) center-based child care programs located\non tribal property which are legally operating under the auspices of a tribal\nauthority that is not a Child Care and Development Fund grantee, which are\noperated in compliance with the applicable tribal laws and regulations for such\nchild care programs; or\n(ii)\na\nchild who is at least two years of age at the beginning of the school year but\nwill turn three years of age on or before the applicable calendar date for\nwhich a child must be at least five years of age to be eligible for admission\nto school; such a child shall be considered three years of age for the purposes\nof staff-to-child ratio and maximum group size. (6)\n\nThe social services district may\nterminate child care subsidy payments and/or take legal action against the\nlegally-exempt child care provider or caretaker as a result of any false\ninformation, certified and attested to by the child care provider or the\ncaretaker on either the enrollment or re-enrollment form or any attachment\nthereto. (g) Additional local standards for subsidized child care. (1)\n\nWhere a social services district is\nsubsidizing child care services pursuant to any of the provisions of this Part, the district may submit to the office justification for a need to impose\nadditional requirements on child care providers providing subsidized child care\nservices and a plan to monitor compliance with such additional requirements. A\nsocial services district may make participation in the Child and Adult Care\n\nFood Program a condition of enrollment for each provider of family child care\nor relative-only family child care who will be providing an average in excess\nof 30 hours of care per week to one or more subsidized children provided the\ndistrict sets forth this requirement in the district's Child and Family\n\nServices Plan. No such additional requirements or monitoring may be imposed\nwithout the written approval of the office. (2)\n\nTo the extent that a social services\ndistrict has established any additional standards for providers of\nlegally-exempt child care, the district is responsible for notifying applicants\nfor and recipients of child care assistance and child care providers of the\ndistrict's requirements. The district's monitoring process must include\nprocedures for notifying the applicable enrollment agency if the district\ndetermines that such a child care provider caregiver is not in compliance with\nan additional standard. Any such procedures established by the social services\ndistrict shall not cause a delay which prevents the enrollment agency from\ncompleting the review of the enrollment package. (h) Administrative actions related to\nchild care providers. (1)\n\nIn\naccordance with guidelines established by the office, a social services\ndistrict may refuse to allow a child care provider that is not in compliance\nwith regulations promulgated by the office, or any approved additional\nrequirements of the social services district, to provide subsidized child care\nservices to a child. (2)\n\nDisqualifications and administrative reviews. (i) A social services district may disqualify\na provider from receiving payment for child care services provided under the\nchild care subsidy program if a provider: (a) is criminally convicted of fraud; (b) is found to be civilly liable for\nfraud; (c) has voluntarily admitted\nto filing a false claim for reimbursement for child care services; (d) has been disqualified from the Child and\n\nAdult Care Food Program, by the New York State Department of Health and/or its\nsponsoring agency, for submission of false information on the application, submission of a false claim for reimbursement or failure to keep required\nrecords; (e) has failed to comply\nwith the terms of a repayment plan with the social services district; (f) has a conviction of any activity that\noccurred in the past seven years that indicated a lack of business integrity; or\n(g) has been found by a social\nservices district, after the social services district has conducted an\nadministrative review in accordance with subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, to have submitted a false claim(s) to a social services district for\nreimbursement; or\n(h) has failed to\ncomply with the terms of a repayment plan for grant programs administered by\nthe Office. (ii)\n\nAn\nadministrative review by a social services district must include the following: (a) A review of the claims submitted to the\nsocial services district and any other information or documentation obtained by\nthe social services district to determine the accuracy of the information\ncontained in the claims; and if a social services district determines after\nsuch a review that a provider submitted inaccurate information in the claims, then a preliminary review report must be prepared by a social services district\nand sent to the child care provider that is the subject of the review for a\nresponse. (b) A child care provider\nmust be given 20 days, from the date the district sent the preliminary review\nreport to respond to the report. A child care provider may respond in writing\npresenting evidence and arguments that the provider believes refute the\nfindings of the preliminary review report, or may request a formal review by a\nsocial services district, which allows a provider, in person, to present\nevidence and arguments in support of his/her position. (c) If no response from a provider is\nreceived by a social services district within 20 days from the date of the\npostmark of the preliminary review report, the report may be finalized by a\nsocial services district. A final report, issued under this subclause, may be\nthe basis for a social services district to disqualify a provider from\nproviding subsidized child care. (d) If a response from a provider is received\nby a social services district within 20 days from the date of the postmark of\nthe preliminary report, the social services district must review and evaluate\nthe response and may make appropriate changes based on the response from the\nprovider, before issuing a final review report. Upon completion of the review, the social services district shall issue a final review report, such report\nmust be sent to the child care provider that is the subject of the\nreview. (e) A child care provider, upon receipt of a final review report, must be given 10 days from the date of\nthe postmark of the final review report to respond, and to request a formal\nreview by the social services district. A final review report issued under this\nsubclause, where a provider does not request a formal review within the 10-day\nspecified timeframe, or does not provide a response that disproves the findings\nof said report, may be the basis for a social services district to disqualify a\nprovider from providing subsidized child care. (f) A social services district, upon receipt\nof a request for a formal review by a provider found in a final review report\nto have submitted inaccurate claims, must conduct such a review within 30 days\nof receipt of the request. (g) A\nsocial services district at a formal review must allow a provider, in person, to present evidence and arguments in support of the provider's\nposition. (h) A social services\ndistrict, after a formal review and after reviewing the evidence and arguments\nsupplied by a provider at a formal review must make a final determination of\nwhether a provider submitted false claims. A final determination that a\nprovider submitted false claims may be the basis for a social services district\nto disqualify a provider from providing subsidized child\ncare. (iii)\nA provider\nwho has been disqualified from receiving payment for child care services\nprovided under the child care assistance program by a social services district\nor the Office under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph is ineligible to receive\nsuch payments through any social services district for five years from the date\nof the disqualification, if such a provider made full restitution of any and\nall falsely obtained funds to the social services district or the Office. If\nsuch a provider did not make full restitution to a social services district or\nthe Office, then the provider will remain ineligible to provide subsidized\nchild care and ineligible for future grant opportunities offered by the\n\nOffice. (iv)\nA social services\ndistrict that disqualifies a provider from receiving a payment for child care\nservices provided under the child care subsidy program must provide appropriate\ninformation concerning the disqualification to the appropriate regional office\nof the office's division of child care services if the provider is a licensed\nor registered day care provider, or to the appropriate legally-exempt caregiver\nenrollment agency if the provider is a legally-exempt child care\nprovider. (3)\n\nIn\naccordance with a plan approved by the office, a social services district will\nhave the right to make announced or unannounced inspections of the records and\npremises of any provider that provides care for subsidized children, including\nthe right to make inspections prior to subsidized children receiving care in a\nhome where the inspection is for the purpose of determining whether the child\ncare provider is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and any\nadditional requirements imposed on such a provider by the social services\ndistrict. A social services district must notify the office immediately of any\nviolations of regulations and must provide the office with an inspection report\ndocumenting the results of such inspection. (4)\n\nNothing contained in this Part will\ndiminish the authority of the local social services district from referring a\nmatter to the appropriate district attorney or law enforcement\nagency. (i) Overpayments. (1)\n\nThe social\nservices district must take all reasonable steps to correct promptly any\noverpayments for child care services to a child's caretaker or a child care\nprovider. (2)\n\nOverpayments must be\nrecovered through: (i) repayment by the\nchild's caretaker or child care provider; or\n(ii)\na reduction in the amount of the payment\nto the child's caretaker or child care provider until the full amount of the\noverpayment is collected; provided, however, that no recovery of overpayments\nmay be made from a child care provider where a contract for such child care\nservices obligates the social services district to make full payment. When no\nrecovery may be made from a child care provider because a contract requires\nfull payment, and repayment is not made from the child's caretaker, Federal\nfinancial participation (FFP) and State reimbursement cannot be claimed for\nsuch overpayment. (3)\n\nIn\nrecovering overpayments for child care services from child care recipients, social services districts must ensure that the child care recipients retain, for any month, a reasonable amount of funds. (4)\n\nRecoupment of such overpayment can be\nmade only from child care benefits unless the child care recipient voluntarily\nrequests that such recovery be made from his or her available income. (5)\n\nOverpayments must be recovered from the\ncaretaker(s) on whose behalf the payments were made or the provider(s) who\nreceived payment for such services, so long as caretaker(s) or provider(s) are\ndeemed responsible for such overpayments whether by acts of omission or\ncommission. (6)\n\nOverpayments to\nchild care providers or former recipients of child care services who refuse to\nrepay may be recovered in accordance with the legal remedies available under\n\nState law. (7)\n\nWhen an overpayment\noccurs as a result of a district's failure to act promptly on information\nprovided by a parent or caretaker regarding circumstances affecting child care\nbenefits, no recovery shall be made from the party who provided such\ninformation. When a recovery cannot be made under this subdivision, Federal\nfinancial participation (FFP) and State reimbursement cannot be claimed for\nsuch overpayment. (8)\n\nUnderpayments\nand overpayments may be offset against each other. (9)\n\nIn all cases involving current child care\nservices recipients, in all cases of fraud, and in all cases where the\noverpayment would equal or exceed the cost of recovery of the overpayment, the\nrecovery of an overpayment must be attempted. (10)\n\nEach social services district must\ncollect and maintain information on the collection of overpayments and make\nappropriate adjustments when claiming FFP and State reimbursement, and when\nsatisfying the district's maintenance of effort requirement under the New York\n\nState Child Care Block Grant Program as set forth in section\n415.7\nof this Part. (11)\n\nAn applicant for child care services who\nhas not repaid past overpayments for previous child care services must agree\nto, and comply with, a plan to make full repayment of such overpayments as a\ncondition of being eligible for new child care services if such overpayments\nresulted from: (i) the failure of the\napplicant, or member(s) of the applicant's family unit, to promptly notify the\nsocial services district of a change in circumstances; or\n(ii)\nchild care services fraud by the\napplicant or member(s) of the applicant's family unit who was a parent or\ncaretaker and responsible for such fraudulent activity. (12)\n\nWith the exception of child care\nservices authorized as a child protective or preventive service, a recipient of\nchild care services who fails to agree to a reasonable plan for repayment or\nrecovery of an overpayment, or who fails to comply with an agreed upon plan, must have their child care benefits suspended or terminated until such time as\nthe recipient comes into compliance with such a plan. (13)\n\nWith the exception of child care\nservices authorized as a child protective or preventive service, a recipient or\nformer recipient of child care assistance who has been convicted of, or has\nvoluntarily admitted to, fraudulently receiving child care assistance must have\nhis or her child care assistance, if any, suspended or terminated and will not\nbe eligible for subsequent child care assistance for a period of time\ndetermined in accordance with the time periods established in subparagraph (i)\nof this paragraph. If such recipient or former recipient is a recipient of\npublic assistance and needs child care in order to participate in an activity\nrequired by the social services district, the disqualification of eligibility\nfor child care assistance based on the former fraud conviction or voluntary\nadmission will be suspended during the recipient's or former recipient's\nparticipation in the required activity. However, the disqualification period\nwill begin or resume once the recipient or former recipient is no longer\nparticipating in a required activity. (i) Unless a court of appropriate jurisdiction specifies a different\ndisqualification period, the recipient or former recipient of child care\nassistance would be ineligible to receive child care assistance: (a) for 12 months for a first\noffense; (b) for 24 months for a\nsecond offense or whenever there is an offense that results in the wrongful\nreceipt of child care assistance in an amount as specified by the office; or\n(c) permanently for a third\noffense or whenever there is an offense that results in the wrongful receipt of\nchild care assistance in an amount as specified by the\noffice. (ii)\nA recipient\nor former recipient of child care assistance that has been disqualified from\nreceiving child care assistance by a social services district under this\nparagraph is ineligible to receive child care assistance, with the exception of\nchild care authorized as a child protective or preventive service or needed to\nparticipate in an activity required by the social services district, unless the\nperson makes full restitution or commits to a plan of restitution of all\nfalsely obtained funds to the social services district. If such a recipient or\nformer recipient of child care assistance does not make full restitution or\ncommit to a plan of restitution to the social services district, then the\nperson will remain ineligible to receive child care assistance, with the\nexception of child care authorized as a child protective or child preventive\nservice or needed to participate in an activity required by the social services\ndistrict. (14)\n\nOverpayments for child care services made as a result of payment for aid\ncontinuing for a caretaker who loses a fair hearing or whose fair hearing is\nwithdrawn, abandoned or defaulted must be recovered as prescribed in this\nsubdivision. (j) Due process requirements. (1)\n\nWritten notice of the determination of eligibility, the family share to be paid\nby the applicant, or ineligibility for child care assistance, as well as any\nmodifications thereto, must be sent to the applicant or recipient in accordance\nwith section 404.l(f) of this Title. Recipients of child care assistance must\nreceive timely and adequate notice of any change in child care assistance, except that changes in the manner or amount of payment for child care\nassistance by a social services district may be made with only adequate notice\npursuant to section\n358-3.3\nof this Title, unless\nthose changes result in a discontinuation, suspension, reduction or termination\nof such benefits, or force a change in child care arrangements. (2)\n\nAn applicant for or recipient of child\ncare services must be notified of the right to a fair hearing in accordance\nwith Part 358 of this Title whenever there is a determination affecting his or\nher family's eligibility for child care services. (k) Nothing contained in this Part will\ndiminish the authority of the office to conduct inspections of licensed or\nregistered child care providers or to provide for such inspections through\npurchase of services in accordance with section\n390\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law. Nothing contained in this subdivision will obligate the\noffice to take any action to enforce any additional requirements imposed by a\nsocial services district on child care providers providing care to children\nreceiving child care subsidies. (l) Each social services district must establish comprehensive fraud and abuse\ncontrol activities for the district's child care subsidy program. A social\nservices district must provide details on its comprehensive fraud and abuse\ncontrol activities in the district's consolidated services plan or integrated\ncounty plan, which must include, but not be limited to: (1)\nidentification of the criteria the social\nservices district will use to determine which child care subsidy applications\nsuggest a higher than acceptable risk for fraudulent or erroneous child care\nsubsidy payments and procedures for referring such applications to the\ndistrict's front end detection system; (2)\na sampling methodology to determine which\ncases the social services district will seek verification of an applicant or\nrecipient's continued need for child care including, as applicable, verification of participation in employment, education or other required\nactivities; and\n(3)\na sampling\nmethodology to determine which providers of subsidized child care services the\nsocial services district will review for the purpose of comparing the\nprovider's attendance forms for children receiving subsidized child care\nservices and any Child and Adult Care Food Program inspection forms to verify\nthat child care was actually provided on the days listed on the attendance\nforms.
