Tit. 15 § 127.9 - Chemical test refusal hearings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Chemical test refusal hearings are\nrequired to be scheduled by the court which arraigns the respondent on a\nrelated charge of a violation of section\n1192\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law, but may be scheduled by the department if the\ncourt fails to do so. Notwithstanding the fact that such hearings may be held\nless than seven days from the date on which the respondent is arraigned in\ncourt, requests for adjournments of chemical test refusal hearings are governed\nby section\n127.7\nof this Part. (b) If no adjournment has been granted, and\nthe respondent fails to appear for a scheduled hearing, the respondent's\nfailure to appear shall be deemed to be a waiver of hearing. Respondent may\npetition for a rehearing, pursuant to section\n127.8\nof this Part and section\n1194-2(c) of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. If such a rehearing is granted, it\nshall be the responsibility of the respondent to insure the presence of any\nwitness he or she wishes to question or cross-examine. (c) If the respondent appears for a first\nscheduled chemical test refusal hearing, and the arresting officer does not\nappear, the matter will be adjourned and any temporary suspension still in\neffect shall be terminated. At any subsequent hearing, the hearing officer may\nmake findings of fact and conclusions of law based upon the chemical test\nrefusal report and any other relevant evidence in the record, notwithstanding\nthe police officer' s nonappearance.
