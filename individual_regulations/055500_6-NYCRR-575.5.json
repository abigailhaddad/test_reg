  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 575.5 - Classifications\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Classification. A species shall be classified and listed as prohibited or\nregulated by the department and the Department of Agriculture and Markets by\napplying the invasiveness ranking system established in\nA Regulatory\n\nSystem for Non-Native Species, June 2010, (\"the\nreport\"). 1\n\nThe department and the Department of\n\nAgriculture and Markets shall consider the following ecological and\nsocio-economic factors to determine the invasiveness rank and whether the\nspecies should be classified as prohibited or regulated: (1)\nthe species meets the definition of\ninvasive species; (2)\nthe species\nis currently on a Federal list or is listed by other states as an invasive\nspecies and its native habitat has climatic conditions similar to that of New\n\nYork State; (3)\necological impacts\nincluding, but not limited to, natural ecosystem processes, community structure\nand composition, and impacts on other species or species groups; (4)\nbiological characteristics and dispersal\nability including, but not limited to, mode and rate of reproduction, potential\nfor dispersal and spread, characteristics which increase competitive\nadvantages, and known related invasive species; (5)\necological amplitude and distribution\nincluding, but not limited to, population status, habitats utilized, role of\ndisturbance in establishment, and climate in native range; (6)\ndifficulty of control; (7)\neconomic benefits or negative impacts of\nthe species; (8)\nhuman health\nbenefits or negative impacts of the species; and\n(9)\ncultural or societal significance of the\nbenefits or harm caused by the species. (b) Species classified as prohibited are\nnonnative species that pose a clear risk to New Yorks economy, ecological\nwell-being and/or human health and: (1)\nare\nlisted on a Federal list as an invasive species and its native habitat has\nclimatic conditions similar to New York State; or\n(2)\nare assessed using the report's\ninvasiveness ranking process established by the department and Department of\n\nAgriculture and Markets, and assigned an ecological invasive ranking of \"Very\n\nHigh\" or \"High\"; or\n(3)\nfor which\nthe results of a qualitative socio-economic assessment, using an accepted\nranking process, established by the department and Department of Agriculture\nand Markets, justifies placing a species that ranked \"Moderate\" or \"Low\" in the\necological assessment in the prohibited category. (c) Grace periods may be established for\nspecies classified as prohibited by the department and the Department of\n\nAgriculture and Markets to allow businesses to plan for the management of\nexisting stock. (d) Species\nclassified as regulated are nonnative species that have the potential to cause\nsignificant harm to New York's economy, ecological well being and/or human\nhealth and could be effectively contained through regulatory programs, and: (1)\nare assessed using the report's\ninvasiveness ranking process, established by the department and Department of\n\nAgriculture and Markets, and assigned an ecological invasive ranking of\n\"Moderate\" or higher invasiveness; or\n(2)\nfor which the results of a qualitative\nsocio-economic assessment, using an accepted ranking process, established by\nthe department and Department of Agriculture and Markets justifies placing a\nspecies that ranked \"Low\" in the ecological assessment in the regulated\ncategory. (e) Invasive\nspecies that are classified pursuant to this section and are identified in\nsections 575.3 and\n575.4\nof this Part, are subject to\nrequirements of this Part consistent with the respective invasive species\nclassification. All future classifications of prohibited and regulated invasive\nspecies shall apply the invasiveness ranking system established in the report\nand required by this section.
