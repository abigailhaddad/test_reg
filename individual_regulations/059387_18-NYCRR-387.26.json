  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 387.26 - Elderly Simplified Application Project (ESAP)\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe ESAP is a federally-approved demonstration project\nwhich streamlines the SNAP application, recertification and verification\nprocesses for eligible seniors and/or disabled individuals. The operation of\nthe ESAP, as set forth in this section, is subject to continued federal\napproval and funding. (a) Eligible\n\nHouseholds. Unless ineligible under subdivision (b) of this section, households\neligible to participate in the ESAP are as follows: Households in which all adult members are: (1)\n\nAge 60 or older and/or disabled; and, (2)\n\nNot in receipt of earned\nincome. (b) Ineligible\n\nHouseholds. Households ineligible to participate in the ESAP are as follows: (1)\n\nHouseholds that are eligible to\nparticipate in the SNAP under the NYSNIP or the NYSCAP; (2)\n\nIndividuals residing in Group Living\n\nFacilities as defined in section\n387.1\nof this Part. (3)\n\nHouseholds in which any member is in\nreceipt of ongoing public assistance as defined by Parts 369 and 370 of Title\n18 NYCRR. (4)\n\nHouseholds not\nmeeting the requirements of subdivision (a) of this section. (c) Shortened and Simplified\n\nApplication. As part of the implementation process, a shortened and\nsimplified SNAP application will be made available. In addition to availability\nfor use at initial application, the application will be distributed with an\nESAPspecific Notice of Expiration (NOE) to participating households at\nrecertification. (1)\n\nUse of the\nshortened and simplified application: (i) The\nshortened and simplified application is intended for use by elderly and/or\ndisabled SNAP applicants; however: (a) Filing\nthe shortened and simplified application is not a requirement for participation\nin the ESAP. An ESAP-eligible household may apply for SNAP using any currently\navailable SNAP application and still be determined eligible for the\nESAP; (b) All SNAP applications, filed in accordance with section\n387.5\nof this Part, will be\nscreened for ESAP eligibility as part of the eligibility determination process; and, (c) ESAP-eligible households, regardless of which application is used at application, will be sent a\nnotification of their eligibility for SNAP benefits under the ESAP. (ii)\n\nThere is no restriction on\nwho may complete and submit the shortened and simplified application for\nconsideration; however: (a) Filing the\nshortened and simplified application does not, in and of itself, entitle an\nindividual to participate in the ESAP; and\n(b) Individuals who are determined ineligible\nfor the ESAP after filing the shortened and simplified application are not\nentitled to receive notice thereof. Such applicants shall receive notification\npursuant to section\n387.20\nof this Part. (iii)\n\nIf, upon screening, a\nshortened and simplified application is determined ineligible for the ESAP, the\napplication must still be considered a SNAP application, and the application\nprocess must be completed in compliance with all SNAP application processing\nrequirements as set forth in this Part. (d) Certification Period. Certification\nperiod for individuals enrolled in the ESAP. (1)\n\nIndividuals found eligible for the SNAP\nand participating in the ESAP shall receive a certification period of up to 36\nmonths. (2)\n\nAn ESAP household\ndetermined ineligible for continuing participation in the ESAP during their\ncertification period but remaining eligible for the SNAP shall not have their\ncertification period shortened. (e) Recertification. Recertification process\nfor households enrolled in the ESAP. All SNAP households enrolled under the ESAP shall be\nrequired to apply for continued participation in the SNAP prior to the end of\ntheir certification in accordance with section\n387.17\n(f) of this\n\nPart, with the following exceptions: (1)\n\nAlong with an ESAP-specific NOE, ESAP-participating households will receive the shortened and simplified\napplication. (2)\n\nRecertification\ninterviews will not be required for every recertification\napplication. (3)\n\nNo recertification\napplication may be denied without first attempting to schedule a\nrecertification interview; however, the social services district need not make\nan effort to schedule an interview unless a recertification application has\nfirst been filed. Upon receipt of a recertification application submitted by an\nESAP-participating household, an interview will only be required in the\nfollowing situations: (i) If the\nrecertification application would be denied; (ii)\n\nIf information on the recertification\napplication is questionable; or\n(iii)\n\nUpon request by the ESAP-participating\nhousehold. (f) Reporting Requirements. Reporting\nrequirements for households enrolled in the ESAP. All households enrolled in the ESAP will be considered\nsimplified reporters, and subject to the rep orting rules as set forth in\nsection\n387.17\n(d) of this\n\nPart, with the following exceptions: (1)\n\nHouseholds are not required to submit a\nperiodic report. At the midway point of the certification period, a contact\nletter will be sent to the household, which will: (i) Include a non-mandatory Interim Report, affording the household an opportunity to update their case information; and, (ii)\n\nInstruct the household\nthat any reported change resulting in an increased SNAP benefit must be\ndocumented and verified in accordance with subdivision (g) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nIn addition\nto the simplified reporting requirements, households are required to report: (i) Any change in household\ncomposition; (ii)\n\nIf any member of\nthe household begins to receive earned income; or\n(iii)\n\nIf any member of the household has\nsubstantial lottery and/or gambling winnings, as defined in applicable federal\nrules and regulations. (g) Verification. Verification requirements\nunder the ESAP. (1)\n\nIn order to ease the\nhousehold burden of providing verification, social services districts may, to\nthe extent possible, use computer matching to verify information related to\ncurrent household circumstances such as: (i) Details concerning the household's gross nonexempt income, namely: (a) The amount of unearned income; and, (b) Whether all sources of\nhousehold income are unearned. (ii)\n\nSocial Security Number; (iii)\n\nDate of Birth; (iv)\n\nDeath; (v) Residency; (vi)\n\nIdentity; and\n(vii)\n\nMedical Expenses. (2)\n\nAll ESAP participants shall be permitted\nto self-declare expenses for standard utility allowances and other shelter\nexpenses. (3)\n\nAny other information\nthat is required to be verified but is not able to be verified by computer\nmatching shall be subject to the SNAP verification requirements as set forth in\nsection\n387.8\nof this Part.
