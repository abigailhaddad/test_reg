  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 82.4 - Unlawful acts of a chain store\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 483(a), 484(a)\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of\nlaw, it shall be unlawful and a violation of article 20-A of the Tax Law for\nany chain store: (1)\nto induce or attempt to\ninduce or to procure or attempt to procure the purchase of cigarettes at a\nprice which is less than the cost of the agent with respect to sales to chain\nstores, if purchased from an agent, or at a price which is less than the cost\nof the CMSA wholesale dealer with respect to sales to chain stores (see\nsections\n82.2\nand\n82.3\nof this Part); or\n(2)\nto induce or\nattempt to induce or to procure or attempt to procure any rebate or concession\nof any kind or nature whatsoever in connection with the purchase of cigarettes\n(see Part 84 of this Title for rebates and concessions). (b) A chain store is considered to be a CMSA\nretail dealer for purposes of its sale of cigarettes to consumers. Accordingly, a chain store may not advertise, offer to sell or sell cigarettes in New York\n\nState at a price which is less than the cost of the CMSA retail dealer (see\nsection\n82.5\nof this Part). (c) (1)\nA chain store may not purchase cigarettes\nin New York State at a price which is less than the cost of the agent with\nrespect to sales to chain stores, if purchased from an agent, or at a price\nwhich is less than the cost of the CMSA wholesale dealer with respect to sales\nto chain stores, if purchased from a CMSA wholesale dealer. A chain store which\nwishes to purchase cigarettes at a price which is less than the cost of the\nCMSA retail dealer, must furnish its supplier with a copy of its New York State\ncertificate of registration as a chain store. Just as the supplier must have\nknowledge of its purchaser, so too must a chain store have knowledge of its\nsupplier. A chain store must be capable of demonstrating to the satisfaction of\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance that it purchased cigarettes at a price\nwhich was not less than the cost of the agent or the cost of the CMSA wholesale\ndealer, as the case may be, with respect to sales to chain stores. In doing so, the chain store may ultimately need to call upon its supplier to help establish\nsuch costs. (2)\nA chain store, which has no reason to believe otherwise, may assume that it has not violated\nany provision of article 20-A of the Tax Law, where such chain store purchases\nstandard brand cigarettes in this State at a price which is greater than or\nequal to the cost of the agent or cost of the CMSA wholesale dealer, with\nrespect to sales to chain stores, as periodically published by the department\nin accordance with sections\n82.2\n(b)(4)\nand\n82.3\n(b)(4)\nof this Part. (d) Illustrations. (1)\n\nThe following\nillustrations exemplify the provisions of this section with respect to\npurchases and sales of cigarettes by chain stores. Such illustrations are a\ncontinuance of sections\n82.2\n(e)(2)(iii)\nand\n82.3\n(f)(3)(ii)\nof this Part. (2)\n\nPurchases by a\nchain store (illustrated). A chain store may not purchase cigarettes in New\n\nYork State at a price which is less than the cost of the agent or the cost of\nthe CMSA wholesale dealer, with respect to sales to chain stores. Using the\ncited examples in sections\n82.2\nand\n82.3\nof this Part, a chain store having 15 or more retail outlets, excluding vending\nmachine operators, where such cigarettes are delivered to a central warehouse\nowned and operated by such chain store and which are then delivered by the\nchain store to its retail outlets may not purchase cigarettes from an agent for\nless than $86 a carton. Other chain stores may not purchase cigarettes from an\nagent or a CMSA wholesale dealer for less than $87.49 per carton. (3)\n\nSales by chain stores (illustrated). A\nchain store may not sell cigarettes in New York State at a price which is less\nthan the cost of the CMSA retail dealer or, using the cited examples in\nsections\n82.2\nand\n82.3\nof this Part, $95.80 per carton. See section\n82.5\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n82.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
