  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4108.2 - Classified races\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Classification by racing secretary. The racing secretary, according to the\nracing secretary's judgment, shall assign horses eligible for classification by\ngait to not more than the following classes based upon ability as demonstrated\nby past performances: FFA (Free-For-All), JFA (Junior-Free-All), AA, A, B, C, D, and where feasible, into not more than three subclasses designated by number\nwithin classes AA, A, B, C, and D. Such assignment shall be made when a horse\nis first accepted for racing at the track and all such assignments and changes\nthereof shall be posted in the declaration room. (b) Races to be based on class. Races shall\nbe offered based upon such classes and where applicable subclasses, and shall\nbe confined to horses posted in the same or slower class or subclass at the\ntime of declaration with preference being given to horses posted in the\nadvertised class or subclass. Starters shall be determined by lot. A race may\nbe conditioned for two or more classes or subclasses, in which case it shall be\ndeemed a handicap race and post positions shall be drawn by class or subclass\nwith the slower class or subclass nearer the rail. (c) Eligibility for classification. (1)\nA horse four years or older is eligible\nfor classification. (2)\nA two- or\nthree-year-old horse may be classified only if it has won three purse races, each for a purse exceeding $450, or two wins and two seconds in such races, or\nif it has been previously classified, or if the owner or trainer thereof\nrequests in writing that the horse be classified. However such request may be\ndenied by the racing secretary. When a two- or three-year-old horse first\nbecomes eligible for classification it may not be classified higher than\nC. (d) Changes in\nclassification. A horse may be advanced or moved back to any class or subclass\nif the horse's performance in the judgment of the racing secretary, demonstrates that it should be so moved to be properly classified, except that\na two-or three-year-old horse may not be advanced to a higher class through AA\nfor the first time until it shall have had at least two starts in the next\nlower class. (e) Basis of\nclassification. Classification and changes in classification shall be based\nupon all performances of a horse, both classified and nonclassified, after it\nhas become eligible for classification. Classification at other tracks may be\ndisregarded. In classifying a two- or three- year-old horse all starts of such\nhorse after it would have become eligible for classified racing shall be\nconsidered as having been made in classified races at the present track. Double\ndashes and any heat racing shall be considered as one race. (f) Preferred races barred. Preferred races\nmay not be conducted in conjunction with classified races but one invitational\nrace per week at each gait may be conducted for the fastest horses at the\nmeeting. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4108.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
