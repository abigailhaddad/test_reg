Tit. 22 § 1300.1 - Dishonored and overdraft check reports\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Special bank accounts required by\nrule 1.15 of the Rules of Professional Conduct (22 NYCRR\n1200.0\n) shall be\nmaintained only in banking institutions which have agreed to provide dishonored\ncheck and overdraft reports in accordance with the provisions of this\nsection. (b) An\nagreement to provide dishonored check and overdraft reports shall be filed with\nthe Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection, which shall maintain a central\nregistry of all banking institutions which have been approved in accordance\nwith this section, and the current status of each such agreement. The agreement\nshall apply to all branches of each banking institution that provides special\nbank accounts for attorneys engaged in the practice of law in this State, and\nshall not be cancelled by a banking institution except on 30 days' prior\nwritten notice to the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection. (c) A dishonored check and\noverdraft report by a banking institution shall be required whenever a properly\npayable instrument is presented against an attorney special, trust or escrow\naccount which contains insufficient available funds, irrespective of whether\nthe instrument is honored [and the banking institution dishonors the instrument\nfor that reason]. A properly payable instrument means an instrument which, if\npresented in the normal course of business, is in a form requiring payment\nunder the laws of the State of New York. (d) A dishonored check and overdraft\nreport shall be substantially in the form of the notice of dishonor which the\nbanking institution customarily forwards to its customer, and may include a\nphotocopy or a computer-generated duplicate of such notice. In the case of an\ninstrument that is presented against insufficient funds, the report shall\nidentify the financial institution, the lawyer or law firm, the account number, the date of presentation for payment, and the date paid, as well as the amount\nof overdraft created thereby. (e) Dishonored check and overdraft\nreports shall be mailed to the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection, 119\n\nWashington Avenue, Albany, NY 12210, within five banking days after the date of\npresentment against insufficient available funds. (f) The Lawyers' Fund for\n\nClient Protection shall hold each dishonored check and overdraft report for 10\nbusiness days to enable the banking institution to withdraw a report provided\nby inadvertence or mistake; except that the curing of an insufficiency of\navailable funds by a lawyer or law firm by the deposit of additional funds\nshall not constitute reason for withdrawing a dishonored check and overdraft\nreport. (g) After\nholding the dishonored check and overdraft report for 10 business days, the\n\nLawyers' Fund for Client Protection shall forward it to the attorney\ndisciplinary committee for the judicial department or district having\njurisdiction over the account holder, as indicated by the law office or other\naddress on the report, for such inquiry and action that attorney disciplinary\ncommittee deems appropriate. (h) Every lawyer admitted to the Bar of\nthe State of New York shall be deemed to have consented to the dishonored check\nand overdraft reporting requirements of this section. Lawyers and law firms\nshall promptly notify their banking institutions of existing or new attorney\nspecial, trust, or escrow accounts for the purpose of facilitating the\nimplementation and administration of the provisions of this section.
