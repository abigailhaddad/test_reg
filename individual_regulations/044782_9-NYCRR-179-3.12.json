Tit. 9 §§ 179-3.12 - Financial procedures for temporary release participants\n\nState Regulations\n\nAs a rule, a resident participating in a temporary release\nprogram shall assume certain costs associated with his participation in a\ntemporary release program as hereinafter described, over and above the cost of\nmaintaining the resident in a Division for Youth facility. Funds may be drawn\nfrom the resident's personal account for these purposes. However, under certain\ncircumstances, the division may use funds from the petty cash account to assume\nthe costs of certain expenses or advance the resident funds for certain costs\nfrom the facility's temporary release schedule for funds. Funds may be issued\nin the amounts designated by the director of the division for the purposes\ndelineated in subdivisions (c) through (g) of this section. (a) Resident's personal account. (1)\n\nFunds shall not be issued to any resident\nfrom his personal account for temporary release purposes until a budget has\nbeen established for the resident and a completed disbursement request signed\nby the resident and forwarded to the facility business office. Requests for\nfunds in excess of a minimum amount as established by the facility director\nmust be approved by the facility director before such funds may be disbursed. All other requests must be approved by the resident's counselor, the facility\nparole officer, the temporary release committee chairperson or the facility\nvocational specialist or similarly trained staff member. (2)\nA resident regularly participating in a\ncontinuous temporary release program must submit a disbursement request, each\nweek, to obtain funds from his account for temporary release expenses. The\nestablished budget or disbursement schedule may not be substantially modified\nwithout prior written permission of the facility director. (b) Approved conditions for advances and\nother funds. (1)\n\nIf a continuous temporary\nrelease participant does not have sufficient funds in his personal account to\nparticipate in a temporary release program, the facility director shall\ndetermine whether the division should assume, or advance funds to the resident\nfor, certain expenses. (2)\n\nFunds\nmay be advanced to a resident from the facility's special temporary release\naccount upon receipt by the business office of a written request from the\nresident approved by the facility director detailing the amount to be advanced\nand the repayment schedule. (3)\n\nAll\nmonetary advances must be reimbursed by the resident. Each resident receiving\nan advance shall be advised of, and sign a statement attesting to, this fact. The facility director, the temporary release committee chairperson or the\ntemporary release parole officer shall be responsible for insuring that these\nfunds are repaid once the resident is in a financial position to repay\nthem. (4)\n\nAdvances shall be repaid\nby subsequently deducting funds from the resident's account in accordance with\nthe established repayment schedule. (5)\n\nThe facility's appropriation shall be\nused to repay any uncollectible advance. (c) Work release and industrial training\nleave financial procedures. (1)\n\nAs a rule, a\nresident assigned to a work release or industrial training leave program shall\nassume the costs of travelling to and from the job site, eating while away from\nthe facility, and for any clothing, tools or other costs directly associated\nwith the performance of the job. (2)\n\nHowever, a resident granted permission to\nleave the facility for a job search furlough may be provided telephone money\nand funds for transportation costs and lunch if the facility does not provide a\nbox lunch. Additionally, a newly arrived unemployed resident searching for his\nfirst job may receive an incentive wage allowance, on a daily basis, until he\nsecures his first job. A continuous temporary release participant who was\nemployed and subsequently becomes unemployed due to no fault of his own also is\nentitled to an incentive wage allowance while in the program. Reimbursement of\nthe incentive wage allowance is not required. (3)\nA resident on work release or industrial\ntraining leave who is employed but has not received his first paycheck may be\nadvanced funds, on a daily basis, for transportation costs, lunch, if the\nfacility does not provide a box lunch, and telephone money. The facility\ndirector also may advance the resident funds to purchase necessary basic work\nclothing, specialized clothing and tools, and to cover other incidental\nexpenses required for the resident's successful participation in the temporary\nrelease program. These funds may be advanced only if, in the judgement of the\nfacility director, there is a substantial likelihood that the funds will be\nreimbursed by the resident. (4)\n\nOnce a resident becomes employed, a weekly budget based on the youth's earnings\nshall be established by agreement between the resident and his counselor or\ntemporary release parole officer. Each week a disbursement request for the\nweekly amount budgeted shall be prepared and submitted to the business office. The resident is responsible for living within the established budget until the\nnext regularly scheduled disbursement. The business office shall issue the\namount of funds requested on the disbursement request unless directed otherwise\nby the facility director. (5)\n\nAs a\nrule, a resident shall assume all costs related to his travel to and from work.

The expenses related to subsequent\nfurloughs will be deducted from the resident's personal account. However, the\ndisbursement of furlough funds from the resident's personal account shall not\nbe allowed to deplete the resident's account to the point that he may not be\nable to meet the following week's work or educational leave expenses.
