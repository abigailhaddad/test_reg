  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.36 - Water-column pipes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The minimum size of pipes connecting the water column to a boiler shall be one\ninch. For pressures of 400 pounds or over, lower water column connections to\ndrums shall be provided with shields, sleeves, or other suitable means to\nreduce the effect of temperature differentials in the shells or heads. Water-glass fittings or gage cocks may be connected directly to the\nboiler. (b) (1)\n\nThe design and material of a water column\nshall comply with the requirements of the ASME Code. Water columns made of cast\niron in accordance with specification SA-278 may be used for maximum boiler\npressures not exceeding 250 psi. Water columns made of malleable iron in\naccordance with specification SA-395 may be used for maximum boiler pressures\nnot exceeding 350 psi. For higher pressures, steel construction shall be\nused. (2)\n\nThe steam and water\nconnections to a water column or a water gage glass, including all pipe, fittings, valves, and drains, shall comply with the requirements of ASME and\nsection\n14-9.23\nof this Subpart. These\nconnections shall be such that they are readily accessible for internal\ninspection and cleaning. Some acceptable methods of meeting this requirement\nwould be by providing a cross or fitting with a back outlet at each right angle\nturn to permit inspection and cleaning in both directions, or by using pipe\nbends or fittings of a type which does not leave an internal shoulder or pocket\nin the pipe connection and with a radius of curvature which will permit the\npassage of a rotary cleaner. The water column shall be fitted with a drain cock\nor drain valve with a suitable connection to the ashpit, or other safe point of\nwaste, and if the water connection thereto has a rising bend or pocket which\ncannot be drained by means of the water-column drain, an additional drain shall\nbe placed on this connection in order that it may be blown off to clear any\nsediment from the pipe. The water-column blowoff pipe shall be at least\nthree-quarters inch pipe size. (c) (1)\n\nWhen the gage glasses and gage cocks required by sections\n14-9.16\nand 14- 9.18 of this\n\nSubpart are not connected substantially directly to the shell or drum of a\nboiler, a water column shall be used into which the gage glass and gage cocks\nshall be connected, excepted as modified by the ASME Code. (2)\n\nThe lower edge of the steam connections\nto a water column and the boiler shall not be below the highest visible water\nlevel in the water gage glass. There shall be no sag or offset in the piping\nwhich will permit the accumulation of water. (3)\n\nThe upper edge of the water connection to\na water column and the boiler shall not be above the lowest visible water level\nin the gage glass. No part of this pipe connection shall be above the point of\nconnection at the water column. (4)\n\nAn acceptable arrangement is indicated in Figure P-45. Image\n(5)\n\nNo outlet connections, except for damper\nregulator, feedwater regulator, drains, steam gages, or apparatus of such form\nas does not permit the escape of an appreciable amount of steam or water\ntherefrom, shall be placed on the pipes connecting a water column to a\nboiler. (6)\n\nWhere valves are\ninstalled between the water column and boiler, at least one steam gage shall be\nconnected directly to the steam space of the boiler with one cock between the\ngage and boiler. Exception:Where a pipe in excess of 10 feet is used, a\nshutoff valve or cock arranged so that it can be locked or sealed open shall be\ninstalled and the pipe shall be of a size to permit blowing out. (7)\n\nWater column drains shall be\ntested daily when the boiler is in operation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.36\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
