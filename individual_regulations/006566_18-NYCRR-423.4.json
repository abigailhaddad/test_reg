(b) Length of\nservice. (1)\n\nPreventive services\nshall continue only if a new determination is made every six months after the\ninitial application for services that the child will be placed or continued in\nfoster care unless such services are provided and that it is reasonable to\nbelieve that by providing such services, the child will be able to remain with\nor be returned to his family. Documentation for compliance with this\nsubdivision shall be pursuant to section\n430.9\n(g) of this\n\nTitle, utilization review-standard for the recertification of mandated\npreventive services.

Local social services districts that exceed the three-month average must have\nthat portion of expenditures in excess of the average reimbursed as nonmandated\npreventive services. (ii)\n\nWhere\nhousing services are provided in the form of payment of rent or mortgage\narrears, such arrears payment must be made directly to the landlord or mortgage\nholder. The amount of such arrears payment may not exceed $1,800, or the\nequivalent of six months of housing services at the maximum amount of $300 a\nmonth, and in no case may exceed the total amount owed. In cases where an\narrears payment relates to a period preceding the date of application for\npreventive services by more than six months, the authorization period will\nbegin six months preceding the date of application. Where the arrears payment\nrelates to a period preceding the application by less than six months, the\nauthorization date will be the date arrears began to accrue.

In such cases the authorization date will be deemed to have commenced on a date\nsix months prior to the date payments were made. Each $300 increment of payment\nmust be included in determining the maximum 36 month eligibility\nperiod. (iv)\n\nWhenever $100 or more\nof a housing subsidy is sought for repairs to rental property, the\nparticipating landlord must agree to rent the property to the family for a\nminimum one- year period commencing on the date housing services are\nprovided.

Discharge may occur on a trial basis. Where adequate housing is made available\nand the child is not discharged within the two month period, the reason for the\nchild remaining in care will be deemed to be due primarily to a factor other\nthan housing and housing services will be terminated. (3)\n\nThe provision of nonmandated prevention\nservices to children and their families during a foster care placement shall\ncontinue only if a new determination is made every six months after the initial\napplication for services that the child will be continued in foster care unless\nsuch services are provided and that it is reasonable to believe that by\nproviding such services, the child will be able to be returned to his\nfamily.

Preventive services must be\nprovided only if the casework contact requirements for children in placement\npursuant to section\n441.21\nof this Title are\nfulfilled. (4)\n\nHousing services\ndefined in section\n423.2\n(b)(16)\nof\nthis Part may only be provided to those families and children who satisfy the\neligibility criteria of section\n430.9\n(e)(2)\nand\n430.9\n(f) of this\n\nTitle. (h) Preventive\nservices to children immediately after discharge. Mandated and nonmandated\npreventive services provided to a child for the first three months following\ndischarge from foster care may include any of the services in section\n423.2\n(b) of this\n\nPart that the child and his family need except that such services shall be in\naddition to the following after care requirements: three face-to-face casework\ncontacts, including one home visit, and one case conference with the preventive\nservices agency that shall be provided by a local social services department or\nby the authorized agency providing the foster care services for the\nchild. (i) Preventive services to\nchildren in receipt of child protective services. (1)\nA child and his family who are in receipt\nof child protective services may receive mandated preventive services if the\nchild is deemed to be at risk of foster care or at risk of returning to care\nand if the child and family meet one of the eligibility criteria as specified\nin section\n430.9\nof this Title, except that\nthe health and safety criteria of section\n430.9\n(c)(1)\nof\nthis Title shall only apply to indicated cases.

(3)\n\nWhen a child and his\nfamily are receiving both preventive services and child protective services, the child protective services unit of the local department of social services\nshall be the sole public agency responsible for receiving and investigating or\narranging with the appropriate society for the prevention of cruelty to\nchildren to investigate all reports of suspected child abuse or maltreatment\nmade pursuant to this Title for the purpose of providing protective services to\nprevent further abuse or maltreatment to children and to coordinate, provide or\narrange for and monitor the provision of those services necessary to safeguard\nand ensure the child's well-being and development and to preserve and stabilize\nfamily life wherever appropriate. (4)\n\nFor all indicated child protective\nservices cases, all monitoring requirements as specified by the department\nshall be followed. When preventive services are purchased by a local district\nfor indicated child protective services cases, the local district shall notify\nthe agency providing services of the local district staff person assigned\nmonitoring responsibility. (j) Preventive services to adopted children. Preventive services may be provided to adopted children who are at risk of\nfoster care according to the client eligibility criteria specified in section\n423.3\nof this Part. (k) Emergency services. (1)\n\nEmergency cash or the equivalent thereto, goods and shelter may be provided if and only if they are directly related to\naverting or abbreviating a foster care placement. When any such expenditures\nare included within the emergency assistance to needy families with children\nprogram as set forth in Part 372 of this Title, the social services district\nmust make an application within 10 days of the provision of these services. Expenditures for these services may not exceed expenditures allowed under the\nemergency assistance to needy families with children program. (2)\n\nBefore emergency shelter is provided to\navert the placement of a child into foster care, social services districts must\ncomply with section\n423.5\n(j) of this\n\nPart. Social services districts must first explore a family's eligibility for\nshelter services or shelter payments under the aid to families with dependent\nchildren, home relief, emergency assistance to needy families with children, emergency assistance to aged, blind and disabled persons, or supplemental\nsecurity income programs as set forth in this Title and, where appropriate, determine eligibility for and provide emergency shelter under such programs. Placement in emergency shelter does not relieve a social services district from\nassisting the family to obtain permanent housing. This assistance may include, where applicable, providing preventive housing services to those families\neligible for such services pursuant to section\n409-a\n(5)(d)\nof the Social Services Law in\naccordance with the provisions of the preventive housing services demonstration\nprogram established pursuant to chapter 165 of the Laws of 1991. (l) Housing services. Housing\nservices, as defined in section\n423.2\n(b)(16)\nof\nthis Part, may be provided only upon the determination by the case manager that\na lack of adequate housing is the primary factor preventing the discharge of\nthe child or children from foster care and that the child or children will be\ndischarged no later than two months after such services have been provided and\nadequate housing has been made available. (1)\n\nWhen any of the services provided as housing services pursuant to this section\nare also available under a public assistance program including aid to families\nwith dependent children, home relief or emergency assistance to needy families\nwith children, the case manager must assure that an application for public\nassistance is made within 10 days of the determination of eligibility for\nhousing services. However, if the service provided pursuant to the aid to\nfamilies with dependent children or home relief program would result in\nrecoupment pursuant to section\n352.31\n(d) of this\n\nTitle, then housing services must be provided as a preventive service instead\nof providing such services under the aid to families with dependent children or\nhome relief program. (2)\n\nWhenever\nhousing services are provided as a preventive service to a family in receipt of\npublic assistance or care, including food stamps and medical assistance, the\ncase manager must provide the local public assistance, food stamp and/or\nmedical assistance office with written notice of such provision within 30 days\nof authorization or modification and not later than 30 days prior to\ntermination of housing services. However, any payment provided as a housing\nservice may not be considered a resource and therefore may not negatively\neffect the family's eligibility for public assistance, food stamp or medical\nassistance benefits. (m) General requirements. (1)\n\nNotwithstanding any\nprovision of this Part and, with the exception of court orders, preventive\nservices shall not be provided to the parents or their children if refused by\nthe parents of the child at risk. (2)\n\nReasonable efforts shall be made by the\npreventive services agencies to communicate with the child and his family in\ntheir primary language. (3)\n\nEach\nchild and his or her family requesting to apply for services must be informed\nof available services, eligibility requirements of the services, the provisions\nof section\n423.7\nof this Part pertaining to\nconfidentiality and preventive services records, and the right to a fair\nhearing pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subdivision and Part 358 of this\n\nTitle. (4)\n\nIn accordance with Part\n358 of this Title, an applicant for preventive services whose application has\nbeen denied or not acted upon within 30 days or a recipient of preventive\nservices whose service has been reduced or terminated by a social services\ndistrict, shall be entitled to a fair hearing by the department, provided the\nrequest is made within 60 days after such action or failure to act. (5)\n\nEach preventive services agency shall\nkeep a record of the number of families applying for or referred for preventive\nservices and a record of whether their applications have been denied and the\nreasons for such denial. (6)\n\nPreventive services must be provided without regard to income. Fees must be\ncollected for preventive day care services in accordance with the day care fee\nschedule as published in the Consolidated Services Plan. Fees must be collected\nfor preventive day services pursuant to subdivision (c) of section\n425.5\nof this Title. In addition, in accordance with the fee schedules established by the department, fees may be\ncollected by a local social services district for the following preventive\nservices: homemaker, housekeeper/chore, clinical services and transportation, if such district establishes a fee schedule and such fee schedule is approved\nby the department. Such fees must be based on documentation of current family\nsize and monthly gross income. Notwithstanding any provision of this Part, a\nfamily that is unable to pay fees is eligible for the service. (7)\n\nStaff and volunteers of agencies providing\npreventive services shall not engage in discrimination or harassment of\nfamilies receiving preventive services on the basis of race, creed, color, national origin, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or\nexpression, marital status, religion, or disability. Such agencies\nshall promote and maintain a safe environment, take reasonable steps to prevent\ndiscrimination by staff and volunteers, promptly investigate incidents of\ndiscrimination and harassment, and take reasonable and appropriate corrective\nor disciplinary action when such incidents occur. For the purposes of this\nsection, gender identity or expression shall mean having or being perceived as\nhaving a gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior or expression\nwhether or not that gender identity, self-image, appearance, behavior or\nexpression is different from that traditionally associated with the sex\nassigned to that person at birth. Gender identity\nrefers to a\nperson's internal sense of self as male, female, no gender, or another gender, and gender expression refers to the manner in which a person expresses his or\nher gender through clothing, appearance, behavior, speech, or other means.
