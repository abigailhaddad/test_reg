  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-1.15 - Full value measurements for market value surveys with valuation dates on or after January 1, 1996, generally\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section applies to full value\nmeasurements for market value surveys with valuation dates on or after January\n1, 1996. These full value measurements will be used to establish State\nequalization rates, class equalization rates and class ratios pursuant to this\n\nPart for cities, towns, village homestead assessing units, village school\nassessing units, county assessing units, coordinated assessment programs and\nconsolidated assessing units. (b) Identification of approach for full value measurement. (1)\n\nWhen an assessing unit implements a\nrevaluation or update on an assessment roll completed within a period beginning\ntwo years prior to and ending two years subsequent to the calendar year of the\nvaluation date for the full value measurement, for the purpose of determining\n\nState equalization rates, class equalization rates, and class equalization\nratios for the assessment roll upon which the revaluation or update is\ncompleted, the full value is determined as provided in subdivision (c) of this\nsection. An assessing unit's implementation of a systematic review of all\nlocally assessed properties within that assessing unit, or within a class of a\nspecial assessing unit, in an attempt to attain a uniform percentage of value\nas of the valuation date of the assessment roll on which those assessments\nappear, shall be deemed a revaluation and/or update for purposes of this\nsection and sections\n8186-2.15, 8186-2.16\nand\n8186-2.17\nof this Part. (2)\n\nFor all other\nassessing units, full value is determined as provided in subdivision (d) of\nthis section. (c) Full\nvalue measurement of assessing units which implement revaluations or updates. (1)\n\nWhen only one revaluation or update is\nimplemented during the period described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the roll on which the revaluation or update is implemented shall be the roll\nused to measure full value for purposes of this section. (2)\n\nWhen an assessing unit implements more\nthan one revaluation or update within the period identified in paragraph (b)(1)\nof this section, the roll used for the purposes of this section shall be\neither: (i) the roll containing a revaluation\nor update implemented in the year of the valuation date of the full value\nmeasurement; otherwise: (ii)\nthe\nmost recent completed roll implementing a revaluation or update. (3)\n\nThe aggregate full value\nestimates are determined from assessment rolls implementing revaluation or\nupdates as provided in section\n8186-2.15\nof this Part. (4)\n\nIf the valuation\ndate of a revaluation or update project is different from the valuation date of\na market value survey, adjustments to the aggregate full value estimate will be\nas provided in section\n8186-2.16\nof this Part. These adjustments will reflect changes in market conditions\noccurring between the valuation date of the revaluation or update and the\nvaluation date of the market value survey. (d) Full value measurement for assessing\nunits which do not implement revaluation or updates. The full value of\nassessing units which do not implement revaluations or updates is determined as\nprovided in section 8186- 2.17 of this Part. (e) Adjustment for changes in quantity of\nproperty between assessment rolls. When the revaluation or update roll, or the\nmeasured roll, is different from the current roll, adjustments to the full\nvalue estimate may be made. These adjustments shall reflect the changes in the\nquantity of property between the revaluation or update roll, or measured roll, and the current assessment roll. These adjustments shall be based upon data\nobtained from the reconciled assessors' reports filed pursuant to Subpart\n8193-4 of this Title. (f) Isolated\nproperties. (1)\n\nCertain properties shall be\nisolated from the full value estimates as provided in the procedures for the\nparticular market value survey. (2)\n\nThe full value of such properties will reflect the quantity of property\nexisting on taxable status date of the current assessment roll, and shall be\nvalued as of the valuation date of the full value measurement. (g) Determination of the full\nvalue of assessing units for equalization rate purposes. (1)\n\nThe full value of an assessing unit is\ncomputed by adding: (i) the full value of\nproperty included in the estimates from subdivision (c) or (d) of this section, after any adjustments made pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section; and\n(ii)\nthe full value of isolated\nproperties. (h) Computation of the tentative State\nequalization rate. (1)\n\nThe total assessed\nvalue of the assessing unit is computed by adding: (i) the total assessed value of Roll Sections\n1 and 6 on the current assessment roll; (ii)\nthe final State land assessments\napproved for the current assessment roll. (2)\n\nThe total assessed value computed in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision is divided by the total full value computed\nin subdivision (g) of this section. The result is multiplied by 100 and rounded\nto two decimal places, and is established as the tentative State equalization\nrate. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
