(1)\n\nThe commission considered\nwhat voting process would best serve the constitutional and statutory mandate\nto carefully evaluate and then nominate to the Governor well qualified\ncandidates for the Court of Appeals. Under the leadership of the late Columbia\n\nLaw School Professor Herbert Wechsler, the commission implemented, and has\nsince successfully used, a voting process that both encourages consensus among\nthe commissioners and promotes a thorough consideration of each candidate. Voting for candidates through successive ballots fosters open discussion of\ncandidates among the commissioners and a deliberative process. This depth of\ndiscussion helps ensure that each commissioner's perspective is heard and that\nthe commissioners have ample information to enable them to compare candidates\nand select those well qualified for the Court of Appeals. (2)\n\nThe commission carefully\nand thoroughly tested the voting procedures described below. A voting system in\nwhich each commissioner ranks a finite number of candidates and assigns the\nhighest number of points to his or her most preferred candidate makes it\nextremely difficult to manipulate the voting and greatly reduces the\npossibility of bloc voting. (b) Overview. (1)\n\nPursuant to section\n63\n(3)\nof the Judiciary Law, a recommendation of\na candidate to the Governor requires the concurrence of at least eight\ncommissioners. During the voting process, the concurrence of at least eight\ncommissioners is established through the requirement that a candidate receive\nat least eight \"affirmative votes\" to be nominated. An affirmative vote is a\nvote by a commissioner that ranks a candidate high enough on that individual\ncommissioner's ballot to place that candidate within the number of candidates\nremaining to be nominated. (2)\n\nIf the commission has not nominated\nany candidates through the concurrence of eight or more members pursuant to\nsection\n7100.8\n(c)(3)\nof\nthis Part, each commissioner present during the nomination process will vote\nfor 15 candidates he or she considers well qualified for the Court of Appeals. A candidate is considered nominated if eight or more commissioners\naffirmatively vote for that candidate and if he or she receives the highest\nnumber of points. (A candidate's \"points\" refers to the aggregate of the\nranking each candidate receives during a round of voting.)\n(3)\n\nIf the candidate or\ncandidates receiving the highest number of points are nominated, then, if the\ncandidate or candidates receiving the second greatest number of points also\nreceived the affirmative vote of at least eight commissioners, that\ncandidate(s) will also be nominated in this round of voting. This process will\nbe repeated with regard to the candidate(s) receiving the next highest point\ntotal until the candidate with the greatest point total among candidates not\nalready nominated in that round of voting fails to receive the affirmative vote\nof at least eight commissioners. At that point, the round of voting\nends. (4)\n\nIf there\nis a tie for the highest number of points, all of the tied candidates receiving\nthe affirmative votes of at least eight commissioners will be nominated. However, if not all of the tied candidates received at least eight affirmative\nvotes, then, after the nomination of those candidates receiving at least eight\naffirmative votes, that round of voting ends. (5)\n\nAdditional rounds of balloting will\nbe conducted if the first round of balloting does not yield the required number\nof candidates. All candidates who are not nominated or dropped from\nconsideration are included on subsequent ballots. The results of voting from\nprior rounds are not included when tabulating subsequent voting; all candidates\nstart each round of voting with zero points and zero affirmative\nvotes. (6)\n\nIf a\nround of voting ends and the number of candidates nominated is not the maximum\nnumber specified in section\n63 (2)(b) or\n(c) of the Judiciary Law, any commissioner\nmay call for further discussion of candidates not previously nominated. During\nthis discussion, candidates may be nominated with the concurrence of at least\neight commissioners. If, at the end of discussion, the number of candidates\nnominated is less than required by section\n63 (2)(b) or\n(c) of the Judiciary Law, the voting process\nwill continue. (7)\n\nAt any time following the completion of the first ballot, in the case of a\nvacancy in the office of Associate Judge, a member may offer a resolution\nreducing the number of candidates to be nominated, within the range stated in\nsection\n63 (2)(b) or\n(c) of the Judiciary Law. The concurrence of\nat least eight commissioners will be required to pass such a\nresolution. (8)\n\nAt\nany time during the voting process, a candidate may be dropped from\nconsideration on the concurrence of at least eight commissioners so long as the\nnumber of remaining candidates plus the number of candidates already nominated\nis within the range specified in section\n63 (2)(b) or\n(c) of the Judiciary Law. (c) Illustration of\nvoting process. To illustrate the voting process, the commission will place on\nits website sample ballots and examples of the balloting process. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
