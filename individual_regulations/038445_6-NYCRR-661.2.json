Tit. 6 § 661.2 - Findings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Tidal wetlands\nconstitute one of the most vital and productive areas of the natural world and\ncollectively have many values. These values include, but are not limited to, marine food production, wildlife habitat, flood and storm and hurricane\ncontrol, recreation, cleansing ecosystems, sedimentation control, education and\nresearch, and open space and aesthetic appreciation, as set forth in the\nlegislative findings contained in section 1 of chapter 790 of the Laws of 1973. Therefore, the protection and preservation of tidal wetlands are\nessential. (b) Several ecological\nzones exist in tidal wetlands. These several zones are as follows: coastal\nfresh marsh; intertidal marsh; coastal shoals, bars and flats; littoral zone; high marsh or salt meadow; and formerly connected tidal wetlands. In addition, adjacent areas, which are important to the protection of tidal wetlands values, adjoin these tidal wetlands zones. (c) These tidal wetlands zones collectively\nserve all of the tidal wetland values set forth in chapter 790 of the Laws of\n1973. However, because of their different natural characteristics, each zone\nmay serve any particular value to a greater or lesser degree than other zones. The varied natural characteristics of the several tidal wetlands zones, including their functions, contour, biota, tidal action, water quality and in\nparticular their respective contributions to the marine food chain, cause\ncertain zones to be relatively more sensitive to the adverse impacts caused by\nland used and development. Similarly, these varied natural characteristics make\nit important to more stringently protect and preserve certain tidal wetlands\nzones relative to other zones. However, any ranking of the value of different\ntidal wetland zones is general in nature, and specific exceptions to such a\nranking do occur. (d) Intertidal\nmarsh and coastal fresh marsh tidal wetlands are the most biologically\nproductive of all tidal wetlands areas. Furthermore, since they receive\ntwice-daily tidal flushing, the products of vegetative photosynthetic activity\nand decomposition in these zones are readily transported to adjacent waters for\nuse in the estuarine food chain. Their intertidal location also makes them\namong the most effective wetland zones for flood and hurricane and storm\nprotection. Both their intertidal location and their highly productive nature\nmakes them among the most effective wetland zones for cleansing ecosystems and\nfor absorbing silt and organic material. Because of these high values and their\nsensitive location at the land and water interface, intertidal and coastal\nfresh marshes must be the most stringently protected and preserved tidal\nwetlands zones. Even small portions of these zones are critically important\nresources. Consequently, only very limited types of land use and development\nare compatible with the values of these areas. (e) Coastal shoals, bars, and flats and\nlittoral zones include areas of extreme variability in their contributions to\nmarine food production and other tidal wetland values, and each such area\nrequires a specific assessment of tidal wetland values. Some coastal shoals, bars and flats and some littoral zones are areas of extremely high biological\nproductivity and are nearly or equally as important in this respect as\nintertidal marshes and coastal fresh marshes. Other areas are of little\nbiological significance. Even in these relatively unproductive areas, however, values other than marine food production are often present, and these areas\noften have the potential to become more biologically productive in the future. Because of their location at the land-water interface, coastal shoals, bars and\nflats and littoral zones play an important role in flood and hurricane and\nstorm control, although they are less important in this regard than coastal\nfresh marshes, intertidal marshes and high marshes or salt meadows. Similarly, because of their location at the land-water interface and because of their\ngenerally high levels of productivity, these areas have an important function\nin cleansing ecosystems and absorbing silt and organic materials, but they are\nalso less critical in these ways than coastal fresh marshes, intertidal marshes\nand high marshes or salt meadows. Where tidal wetlands values, particularly\nbiologic productivity, are high, only limited types of land use and development\nare compatible with the values of these areas. Where tidal wetland values are\nrelatively lower, more extensive and intensive uses may be compatible with the\nwetland values of these areas. (f) Some areas possess the physical characteristics of littoral zones or coastal\nshoals, bars or flats but do not function biologically as tidal wetlands. Such\nareas have generally been heavily impacted by pollution, sedimentation or other\nartificial disturbance, exhibit little primary productivity, and are populated\nby few benthic organisms. Such areas require identification on a case-by-case\nbasis and when so identified should no longer be treated as tidal wetlands\nunder this Part. (g) High marsh or\nsalt meadow tidal wetlands constitute an extensive zone of the salt marshes\nthat receives only occasional tidal flooding coincident with extreme lunar\ntides and occasional storms. Since their photosynthetic productivity is lower\nthan coastal fresh marshes and intertidal marshes and since flushing of the\nbiological products of the high marsh or salt meadow to the estuary is less\nefficient than in coastal fresh marshes and intertidal marshes, salt meadows or\nhigh marshes, while critically important for marine food production, are\nslightly less important in this regard than coastal fresh marshes or intertidal\nmarshes. Because of their size and location salt meadows or high marshes are as\nimportant for absorption of silt and organic material and flood and hurricane\nand storm control as coastal fresh marshes and intertidal marshes. Furthermore, because they are located generally in such a way that they are the first tidal\nwetland area to receive run-off and other materials from the land, they have an\nimportant role in cleansing ecosystems, but their value in this respect is\ngenerally slightly less than in coastal fresh marshes and intertidal marshes\nbecause of the lower level of direct tidal influence in high marshes or salt\nmeadows. Because these wetlands are usually located adjacent to intertidal\nmarshes and because their values are similar, these wetland areas must be\nstringently protected and preserved. Even small portions of these areas are\ncritically important resources, although slightly less so than intertidal\nmarshes and coastal fresh marshes. Consequently, only very limited types of\nland use and development are compatible with the value of these\nareas. (h) All of the\nabove-described tidal wetland zones may occur behind shifting natural barriers\nthat are breached by intermittent tidal inlets which allow tidal action to\naffect such wetlands. (i) Formerly\nconnected tidal wetlands are lowland areas whose connections to tidal waters\nare restricted by road fills, dikes, or other man-made facilities. The nature\nand value of these tidal wetland areas are widely variable and are a function\nof the extent of the tidal restriction and the time which has passed since the\nrestriction occurred. Therefore, a case-by-case analysis of these wetlands is\nrequired. Each of these tidal wetland areas closely resembles another type of\nwetland zone. Those uses compatible with the type of wetland zone which a\nparticular formerly connected tidal wetland most closely resembles will be\ngenerally compatible with that formerly connected wetland. (j) Adjacent areas make insignificant\ncontributions to marine food production. Tidal wetland values for cleansing\necosystems, flood and hurricane and storm control, and absorbing silt and\norganic material may be served to varying degrees by these areas, but these\nvalues are not as critically served in adjacent areas as in the tidal wetland\nzones. The most important function of adjacent areas is to serve as buffers to\nprotect the character, quality and values of tidal wetlands that adjoin or lie\nnear these areas. Consequently, a wide variety of uses may be compatible with\nthese areas, provided such uses do not adversely affect adjacent and nearby\ntidal wetlands. (k) All of the\ntidal wetland zones and adjacent areas generally serve to an approximately\nequal degree the wildlife habitat, recreation, education and research, and open\nspace and aesthetic appreciation values of tidal wetlands. Variations do occur\nin the values served from, for example, a particular intertidal marsh to\nanother or from a particular high marsh or salt meadow to another. Furthermore, one type of tidal wetland or an adjacent area may serve a particular wildlife\nhabitat, recreation, education and research, or open space and aesthetic\nappreciation value. These variations depend on a wide variety of factors, including the particular value sought to be served, the quality and diversity\nof the natural resources of a particular area, the size and location of the\narea, the natural features and land uses surrounding the particular area, and\nthe time of year. Generally, tidal wetlands and adjacent areas are the habitat\nfor a large number of wildlife species, provide large expanses for a variety of\nrecreational purposes, offer conditions useful for many education and research\npurposes and satisfy a broad spectrum of aesthetic appreciation and open space\nneeds. (l) The productivity and\nvariability of tidal wetlands and their location in a constantly changing\nenvironment mean that whatever the present existing values of a particular\ntidal wetland are, the ability of that wetland to serve these values generally\ncontinues provided it is allowed to function in a substantially natural and\nundisturbed state. Furthermore certain human-induced modifications of tidal\nwetlands can increase tidal wetland values when carefully designed and\nundertaken. Consequently, land use and development in or near tidal wetlands\nmust be compatible with the present and potential values of tidal\nwetlands. (m) Tidal wetlands are\nlocated at the critical interface between land and tidal waters, and the amount\nof this land-water boundary is limited. Certain types of land use and\ndevelopment require access to tidal waters, while others do not. Given the\ncritical values served by tidal wetlands, the limited extent of the land-water\nboundary, and the many types of land use and development that require water\naccess and should be located where they will not substantially impair tidal\nwetland values, land use and development that does not require water access\ngenerally should not be located in tidal wetlands or adjacent areas. (n) While tidal wetlands and adjacent areas\ncontain distinct zones, as set forth in these findings, these areas are\nessentially an integrated natural system. The resources in one area utilize and\ndepend on the resources in other areas. The tidal wetland benefits produced in\none area benefit nearby areas, and the negative impacts imposed on the natural\nvalues of one area are transferred to other nearby tidal wetland areas. Consequently, land use and development occurring in any particular tidal\nwetland or adjacent area may cause impacts on nearby areas and should be\ncompatible with the values of the particular area on which it is located as\nwell as with the values of nearby tidal wetlands.
