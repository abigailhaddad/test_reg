Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n197.30\n\nThe segregation provided for in paragraph A hereof is\nnot required to be established immediately, but shall be established as soon as\nis reasonably practicable and not later than the completion of the continuing\nproperty record provided for in section\n197.22.
