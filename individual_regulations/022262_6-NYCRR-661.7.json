Tit. 6 § 661.7 - Uses not requiring a permit\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any use, where otherwise legally permitted, listed in section\n661.5\nof this Part as a use not\nrequiring a permit (NPN) for a particular tidal wetland zone or for an adjacent\narea, may be undertaken in such tidal wetland zone or adjacent area without a\npermit under this Part, provided such activity does not involve a regulated\nactivity. (b) Any alteration of a\ntidal wetland or adjacent area with respect to which a moratorium permit has\nbeen issued pursuant to Part 660 of this Title, or with respect to which a\npermit pursuant to Part 608 of this Title shall have been issued prior to\n\nSeptember 1, 1973, may be undertaken or continued pursuant to the terms of such\npermit without a permit under this Part; provided, however, that any such\nalteration that is defined in this Part as a regulated activity, shall be\ntreated for all purposes as a new activity under the provisions of this Part as\nof August 20, 1977, if such activity has not been substantially commenced as of\nthat date. The department may extend the exemption herein provided for an\nalteration covered by a moratorium permit or Part 608 permit beyond August 20, 1977, if in the department's judgment the pertinent natural or man-made\nconditions which existed at and adjacent to the site at the time such permit\nwas issued have not substantially changed and the site is still suitable for\nthe permitted activity. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no alteration of a tidal\nwetland zone or adjacent area authorized by a permit pursuant to Part 660 or\n608 of this Title that is treated as an incompatible use for such zone or area\nunder section\n661.5\nof this Part shall be\nundertaken or continued in that zone or area after August 20, 1977, except in\ncompliance with the provisions of this Part.
