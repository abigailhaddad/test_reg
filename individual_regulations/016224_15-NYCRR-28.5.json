  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 28.5 - Temporary evidence of apportioned registration\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. The department is aware that IRP\nregistrants in this State may find that in some emergency situations it may be\nnecessary to make changes in fleet registrations or to replace lost or stolen\nIRP documents more rapidly than can be accomplished following routine\nestablished procedures. The department will attempt to service these emergency\nsituations through the use of a procedure for the issuance of the Temporary\n\nEvidence of Apportioned Registration. However, the use of such emergency\nprocedures will not be allowed to unduly interfere with the routine processing\nof registration applications. Therefore, upon notice, the department may\neliminate specific registration changes from such Temporary Evidence of\n\nApportioned Registration procedure. (b) Procedure for issuance of Temporary\n\nEvidence of Apportioned Registration (TEAR). (1)\nA registrant who has a fleet IRP\nregistered in this State, and is in good standing may apply to the\n\nInternational Registration Bureau of the department to purchase one or more\nTEARs. An established wire service may apply to the International Registration\n\nBureau of the department on behalf of the department. With respect to the\nprocessing of TEARs, an established wire service shall act solely as a\ntransmitter of requests for issuance of TEARs and transmitter of issued TEARs\nto qualified registrants. (2)\n\nIn\norder to have an assigned TEAR issued, the following information must be\nsubmitted to the International Registration Bureau of the department by\nelectronic means: the vehicle identification number of the vehicle for which\nthe TEAR is requested, the name and address of the registrant to which the TEAR\nwill be issued, the name and address of the established wire service, if the\nrequest is being submitted by a registrant through an established wire service, the fax number to which the issued TEAR is to be sent, and a copy of a properly\ncompleted form provided by the commissioner for the transaction which is being\nmade. (3)\n\nUpon receipt of request\nfor issuance of a TEAR, the department shall verify the information submitted\nand that the registered or established wire service is eligible to have TEARs\nissued. If it is appropriate to issue the TEAR, the transaction will be\npartially processed by the department and an invoice produced. The department\nshall then issue the TEAR and electronically transmit it to the fax number\nprovided. If the TEAR is transmitted to an established-wire service, that\nservice shall be responsible for delivery of the TEAR or a copy of the TEAR to\nthe registrant to whom the TEAR is being issued. The department shall then mail\nthe invoice to the registrant together with a list of any documentation which\nmay be required to be submitted. The documentation which is required is the\ndocumentation that is necessary for the registration change that is being made\nor is necessary for the replacement of IRP items as set forth in section\n28.2\nof this Part. The amount\nwhich will be contained on the invoice will be the total fee required for the\nregistration change or replacement of IRP items and a TEAR fee per vehicle, which fee shall not be refundable. (4)\n\nThe registrant to whom the TEAR has been\nissued must submit all required documents and fees indicated on the invoice to\nthe International Registration Bureau of the department within 30 days from the\ndate the TEAR was processed. Upon receipt of proper documentation and fees, the\ntransaction processing will be completed and the appropriate IRP documents will\nbe produced by the department and mailed to the registrant. Failure of the\nregistrant to submit required documentation and fees within that 30-day period\nwill result in suspension of the registration of all vehicles for any fleet\nregistered in its name and may result in the inability of that registrant to\nobtain TEARs in the future for any vehicle registered in its name. (c) TEAR document and its use. (1)\nA TEAR issued by the department shall be\na computer- generated and electronically transmitted document. (2)\nA TEAR issued by the department shall be\nvalid for use in accordance with its terms without further IRP items for that\nvehicle (i.e., cab card and/or number plate/sticker). A TEAR issued by any\nother IRP jurisdiction which TEAR specifically provides for operation in this\n\nState shall be valid for operation in this State in accordance with the terms\ncontained on such TEAR.
