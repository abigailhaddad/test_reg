  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 5005.1 - Offers in compromise of fixed and final tax liabilities\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 171(15th)\n(a) General. Section\n171\nsubdivision fifteenth of the Tax Law allows for\noffers in compromise for any taxes or other impositions or any warrant or\njudgment of taxes or other impositions administered by the Commissioner of\n\nTaxation and Finance. The provisions of section 171, subdivision fifteenth and\nthis Part apply to any tax or other imposition administered by the\ncommissioner. Under section 171 subdivision fifteenth, an offer in compromise\nmay only be made where the liability has been finally fixed and where the\ntaxpayer has exhausted the taxpayer's protest rights. (b) Grounds for compromise. (1)\nA compromise under this section may be\nmade where the taxpayer has been discharged in bankruptcy or is shown by proof\nto be insolvent, or where an individual taxpayer shows by proof that collection\nin full would cause the taxpayer undue economic hardship. The amount acceptable\nin compromise must reasonably reflect collection potential or be otherwise\njustified by proof offered by the taxpayer. In the case of trust tax\nliabilities (\ne.g., withholding or sales, but not use, taxes), an amount less than the tax, exclusive of penalties and interest, would not\nnormally be acceptable. If, however, upon consideration of all factors, it is\napparent that accepting an offer would be in the best interests of all parties, an offer may be accepted for an amount less than the tax as long as the amount\noffered reasonably reflects collection potential. In addition, with respect to\ntrust tax liabilities, a responsible person of the taxpayer may make an offer\nto compromise such person's liability. A separate appraisal will be made of the\nability of such responsible person to pay in determining if an individual offer\nshould be accepted. Acceptance of an offer from one responsible person with\nrespect to trust tax liabilities will not relieve any remaining responsible\npersons - nor the entity itself - from any outstanding balance due on the total\nliability. (2)\n\nFor purposes of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, a taxpayer is insolvent where the taxpayer's\nliabilities exceed the fair market value of the taxpayer's assets. In\ndetermining the taxpayer's liabilities, all liabilities will be included, including the amount of the taxpayer's tax debt. (3)\n\nUndue economic hardship. (i) Undue economic hardship occurs when a\ntaxpayer is unable to pay reasonable basic living expenses. The determination\nof a reasonable amount for basic living expenses will be made by the department\nand will vary according to the unique circumstances of the individual taxpayer. The inability to maintain an affluent or luxurious lifestyle does not\nconstitute undue economic hardship. Because economic hardship is the inability\nto meet reasonable basic living expenses, it applies only to individuals, including sole proprietorship entities. Undue economic hardship does not apply\nto corporations or other non-individual entities. The taxpayer's financial\ninformation and special circumstances will be examined. (ii)\n\nFinancial information. The taxpayer's\nincome and basic living expenses must be considered to determine if the\ntaxpayer qualifies for an offer in compromise due to undue economic hardship. (a) Basic living expenses are those expenses\nthat provide for the health, welfare, production of income of the taxpayer and\nthe taxpayer's family. The department will look to national and local standard\nexpense amounts used by the Internal Revenue Service as a guideline to provide\naccuracy and consistency in determining a taxpayer's basic living\nexpense. (b) Expenses that are not\ngenerally allowed as necessary living expenses unless the taxpayer can show\nthat the expenses are necessary for the health and welfare of the taxpayer or\nthe taxpayer's family or for the production of income include but are not\nlimited to: (1)\ntuition for private\nschools; (2)\npublic or private\ncollege expenses; (3)\ncharitable\ncontributions; (4)\nvoluntary\nretirement contributions; (5)\npayments on unsecured debt, such as credit cards; or\n(6)\nother similar expenses. (iii)\n\nOther factors. In\naddition to the basic living expenses, other factors are considered that can\nimpact a taxpayer's financial condition, including: (a) taxpayer's age and employment status and\nhistory, and the taxpayer's ability to earn; (b) number, age and health of\ndependents; (c) cost of living\nwhere the taxpayer resides; (d) extraordinary circumstances such as special educational expenses, a medical\ncatastrophe or a natural disaster; (e) any other fact that the taxpayer claims\nbears on economic hardship. (iv)\n\nFactors that support an undue economic\nhardship determination may include: (a) The\ntaxpayer is incapable of earning a living because of a long term illness, medical condition or disability, and it is reasonably foreseeable that the\ntaxpayer's financial resources will be exhausted providing for care and support\nduring the course of the condition. (b) The taxpayer has a set monthly income and\nno other means of support and the income is exhausted providing for the care of\ndependents. (c) The taxpayer has\nassets, but is unable to borrow against equity in assets, and liquidation to\npay the outstanding liability would render the taxpayer unable to meet basic\nliving expenses. (4)\n(i) Reasonable collection potential is based on the total realizable value of the\ntaxpayer's assets and the amount that could reasonably be expected to be\ncollected from the taxpayer's anticipated future income, after giving effect to\nall priorities granted to New York State and applicable statutes of limitations\non collections. (a) The realizable value of\nthe taxpayer's assets is the amount that could reasonably be expected from the\nsale of the assets within 90 days or less (quick sale value) minus any amount\nowed to a secured creditor with priority over the department's interest. Assets\nsuch as real property, personal and business assets, and vehicles will\ngenerally be valued at 80 percent of fair market value to determine the quick\nsale value. (b) Generally, anticipated future income is calculated over the remainder of the collection\nperiod, but no less than a period of 5 years and no more than a period of 10\nyears, unless there are circumstances indicating that a significant recovery\ncan reasonably be expected if a longer period is used. Other circumstances, including the age of taxpayer, the age of the liability, and the best interests\nof the State are also considered. In addition, collateral agreements, such as\nagreements pertaining to payments from future income, may also be required\nbased on the facts in a particular case. (ii)\n\nWhen evaluating an offer in compromise, the department will consider the legal collection proceedings available to it. Under the Tax Law, where a taxpayer has failed to pay the taxpayer's\noutstanding liabilities, the department may file a tax warrant against the\ntaxpayer with the Department of State and in the appropriate county clerk's\noffice. A filed tax warrant is entered in the judgment docket and secures the\n\nState of New York as a lienholder of the taxpayer's personal and real property, and empowers the department to use the collection procedures set forth in\narticle 52 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules relating to enforcement of money\njudgments. These collection procedures may result in, for example, the seizure\nand sale of the taxpayer's real and personal property, including but not\nlimited to, seizure of money from the taxpayer's bank accounts and seizure of\nany motor vehicles which the taxpayer may own, or a levy against money that a\nthird party owes the taxpayer, such as a loan or rent owed to the taxpayer. In\naddition, the department may issue an income execution against the wages of the\ntaxpayer. Under an income execution, the department generally may take up to 10\npercent of the taxpayer's gross wages to satisfy the liability. (5)\n\nAn offer in compromise will\nnot be accepted for any reason where acceptance of such an offer would\nundermine voluntary compliance with the taxes or other impositions administered\nby the commissioner or would not be in the best interest of the State. Factors\nindicating that an offer would undermine voluntary compliance or would not be\nin the best interests of the State may include a taxpayer's overall history of\nnoncompliance, a taxpayer's deliberate actions to evade payment, and a\ntaxpayer's encouragement of others to refuse to comply with the tax\nlaws. (c) Submission of an offer. (1)\n\nAn\noffer in compromise must be filed on forms prescribed by the Commissioner of\n\nTaxation and Finance for such purpose at the address prescribed in the forms. The forms are available from the department or on the department's website. The\ncompromise offer must be in addition to the total amounts previously paid, or\ncollected, against the liability being compromised, if any. If the final\npayment on an accepted offer is contingent upon the immediate or simultaneous\nrelease of a tax lien in whole or in part, such payment must be remitted by\nmeans, acceptable to the Department of Taxation and Finance, that assures\nunconditional and final payment, such as certified check, bank check or postal\nmoney order. (2)\n\nAs a condition to\naccepting an offer in compromise, a taxpayer must submit a statement of\nfinancial condition and other information on the forms prescribed by the\ndepartment for such purpose. Although current financial statements, which have\nbeen examined and upon which an opinion has been expressed by an independent\nlicensed public accountant or an independent certified public accountant\npursuant to an audit conducted by such accountant, will generally not be\nrequired, in some circumstances a taxpayer may be required to submit such\nstatements. The statement of financial condition, and any other information\nsubmitted to support an offer in compromise, becomes the property of the\ndepartment and cannot be returned to the taxpayer. The department may also\nrequire, as a condition of approval of an offer: (i) a signed agreement wherein the taxpayer\nagrees to pay over a fixed percentage of the taxpayer's future earnings or\nother income for a specific period of time; (ii)\nwhere an offer is to be satisfied\nthrough periodic payments as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, collateral or other security pledged over the life of the installment payments; or\n(iii)\nanything else deemed\nnecessary given the facts of the case and the taxpayer's\ncircumstances. (3)\n\nNo\noffer in compromise shall be accepted unless the taxpayer: (i) agrees that the commissioner shall keep\nall payments, funds collected and other credits made to the liability for the\nperiods covered by the offer, and all amounts to which the taxpayer may be\nentitled under the Tax Law, due through overpayments of any tax or other\nliability, including, interest and penalties, for periods ending before or\nwithin or as of the end of the calendar year in which the offer is accepted\n(and which are not in excess of the difference between the liability sought to\nbe compromised and the amount offered); (ii)\nagrees to immediately return to the\ndepartment any refunds of overpayments referred to in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph received by the taxpayer after the taxpayer's offer was\nfiled; (iii)\nagrees to not contest\nin court or otherwise, the amount of the liability sought to be\ncompromised; (iv)\nwaives the\nrunning of the statutory period of limitations on collection of the tax\nliability involved for: the period during which the offer is pending; the\nperiod during which any installment remains unpaid; and for one year\nthereafter; (v) agrees to comply\nwith all provisions of the New York State Tax Law relating to filing of returns\nand paying required taxes for all returns required to be filed in the five-year\nperiod beginning with the date of the acceptance of the offer; and\n(vi)\nis in compliance with all New York State\ntax filing and payment requirements for periods not covered in the offer. In addition, the department may require the taxpayer to agree\nto any other conditions which may be necessary to effectuate a just offer in\ncompromise. (4)\n\nThe taxpayer must make a good faith offer. Generally, taking into account the\nreason for denial, once an offer has been denied, another offer may be\nreconsidered only upon a showing of a material change in circumstances or if\nthere is a meaningful increase in the offer. Additionally, the department may\nreconsider an offer that was previously denied due to a misinterpretation or a\nmisunderstanding on the part of the department of the information contained in\nsuch offer. The department will work, to the extent possible, with the taxpayer\nto try to effectuate a compromise likely to be accepted by the\ncommissioner. (5)\n\nThe filing of an\noffer in compromise shall not automatically operate to stay the collection of\nany tax liability. However, enforcement of collection may be deferred if the\ninterests of the department shall not be jeopardized thereby. (d) Review of an\noffer. (1)\n(i) The commissioner, or such person as may\nbe designated by the commissioner, will accept or reject the offer in\ncompromise and the department will promptly notify the taxpayer in writing of\nsuch action. (ii)\n\nWhere the tax\namount (exclusive of penalty and interest) to be compromised is more than\n$100,000, the offer accepted by the commissioner, or such person as may be\ndesignated by the commissioner, must be referred to a justice of the Supreme\n\nCourt for approval prior to notification of acceptance by the commissioner, or\nsuch person as may be designated by the commissioner. Such an offer is not\neffective until approved by a justice of the Supreme Court. (2)\n\nGenerally, within 60 days of\nnotification of final approval of an offer, full payment of the compromised\namounts must be made to the department. However, where a taxpayer can\ndemonstrate the need for periodic payments over a period of time, the\ndepartment has the authority to grant a reasonable period of time for repayment\nof an offer not to exceed two years. Where special circumstances are\ndemonstrated, the two-year period may be extended at the discretion of the\ncommissioner or such person as may be designated by the commissioner. In the\ncase of periodic payments, interest will be due at the annual rate established\nunder the Tax Law on any deferred amounts of the offer from the date of notice\nof acceptance until the offer is paid in full. (3)\n\nNo liability will be considered\ncompromised nor any warrant satisfied until all obligations of the taxpayer\nunder the compromise agreement are performed. (e) Withdrawal or rejection. (1)\n\nAn offer in compromise may be withdrawn\nby the taxpayer making the offer at any time prior to its acceptance. Further, the department may hold an offer made by the taxpayer in abeyance if the\napplication and any other required information/documentation are not complete. In such a case, the taxpayer will ordinarily have 30 days after notification\nfrom the department in which to submit the information required to complete the\napplication and/or any other forms, unless the taxpayer can demonstrate to the\nsatisfaction of the department that more time will be needed. If the required\ninformation is not timely submitted to the department, the offer in compromise\nwill be deemed to be formally withdrawn. (2)\n(i) The\ndepartment may reject an offer in compromise. The following exemplify reasons\nfor rejecting an offer in compromise: (a) failure to meet the statutory requirements (\ne.g., the taxpayer\nhas not been discharged in bankruptcy is not insolvent, or does not show by\nproof that collection in full would cause the individual taxpayer undue\neconomic hardship and/or the amount acceptable in compromise does not\nreasonably reflect collection potential or is not otherwise justified by proof\noffered by the taxpayer; (b) making\na frivolous offer or filing an offer for the purpose of delaying the collection\nof tax liabilities; (c) failure to\nverify financial information, where required; (d) failure to make full financial disclosure\n(\ne.g., not fully disclosing all assets or income); (e) where there is evidence of conveyance of\nassets for less than fair market value after the taxpayer has knowledge of the\nliability; (f) for public policy\nconsiderations; (g) where the\ntaxpayer has not demonstrated a good faith effort to repay/resolve the tax debt\n(\ni.e., where the taxpayer has displayed a wanton disregard for\nthe tax debt over an extended period of time and disposed of significant assets\nand other holdings); or\n(h) where\nthe tax liability sought to be compromised directly relates to any crime for\nwhich the taxpayer has been convicted. (ii)\n\nThe causes for rejection of an offer in\ncompromise set forth in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph are not\nall-inclusive nor should any one cause be interpreted as restricting or\notherwise limiting the department's discretion with respect to other\ncauses. (3)\n\nReceiving\nacceptance of an offer in compromise is a privilege, not a right, available to\nfinancially distressed taxpayers in order to put overwhelming liabilities\nbehind them. In the event an offer is rejected, the taxpayer making the offer\nshall be promptly notified in writing. (f) Defaults. Where a taxpayer does not comply with the conditions of the\ntaxpayer's offer in compromise (including any requirements with respect to\ncollateral agreements) as accepted by the department, or where there is\nevidence of a substantial misrepresentation of a material fact subsequent to\nthe acceptance of the offer by the department, the department may reimpose the\nfull tax liability (including all applicable interest and penalties), apply all\namounts previously deposited under the offer against the amount of the\nliability sought to be compromised, and proceed to collect the balance of the\noriginal liability.
