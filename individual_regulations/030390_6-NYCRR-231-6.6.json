  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-6.6 - Emission offset requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Emission offset applicability'. For a NSR major modification, the project\nemission potential must be offset. (b) 'Offset ratio'. (1)\n\nAn emission offset of VOC or\nNO\nx\nmust exceed the corresponding project emission\npotential (subsequent to application of LAER), as appropriate, by the\napplicable offset ratio specified in Subpart 231-13 of this Part. A greater\noffset ratio may be required, on a case by case basis, to provide an acceptable\ncontribution demonstration as set forth in this section. (2)\n\nAn emission offset of PM-10 must at least\nequal (offset ratio of one to one or greater) the corresponding project\nemission potential (subsequent to application of LAER), as appropriate, by the\napplicable offset ratio specified in Subpart 231-13 of this Part. A greater\noffset ratio may be required to provide a net air quality benefit as set forth\nin this section. (3)\n\nAn emission\noffset of PM-2.5 (including applicable precursors) must at least equal (offset\nratio of one to one or greater) the corresponding facility potential to emit or\nproject emission potential of the same pollutant (subsequent to application of\nLAER), as appropriate, by the applicable offset ratio specified in Subpart\n231-13 of this Part. A greater offset ratio may be required to provide a net\nair quality benefit as set forth in this section. (c) 'Use of an ERC as an emission offset'. An\nERC must meet the following requirements to be used as an emission offset: (1)\nfor NO\nx, PM-10, and VOC emissions, ERCs must have physically occurred on or after November 15, 1990 but need not be contemporaneo us; (2)\nfor PM-2.5 (including its precursors\nSO\n2\na n d N O\nx\n), ERCs must have\nphysically occurred on or after April 5, 2005 but need not be\ncontemporaneous; (3)\nan ERC, or\nportion thereof, must be included as a condition in the permit f or the\nproposed NSR major modification for which the reduction is\nused. (d) 'Net air quality\nbenefit and emission offset location f or PM-10, or PM-2.5 (including\napplicable precursors)'. An emission offset of PM-10, or PM-2.5 (including\napplicable precursors) must meet the following requirements: (1)\n\nContribution demonstration. An emission\noffset may be obtained from the same nonattainment area in which a proposed NSR\nmajor modification is to be located. An emission offset may also be obtained\nfrom other nonattainment areas of equal or higher classification if emissions\nfrom such other areas contribute to a violation of the NAAQS for PM-10 or\nPM-2.5 in the nonattainment area where the proposed NSR major modification is\nto be located. These other areas must be determined in accordance with\ndepartment approved modeling procedures. (2)\n\nNet air quality benefit demonstration. As\npart of a permit application, the applicant must submit an air quality impact\nevaluation for PM-10 and PM-2.5, as applicable, in accordance with department\napproved modeling procedures. The ambient air quality impact analysis must\ndemonstrate that: (i) the net impact of the\nproposed emissions increase and the emission offset provides for a net benefit, on balance, in the area affected by the proposed NSR major modification; and\n(ii)\nfor PM-10 and PM-2.5, the\nnet impact in no case exceeds an applicable significant impact level set forth\nin section\n231-12.6\nof this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nInterstate\noffsets. An emission offset of PM-10, or PM-2.5 (including applicable\nprecursors), may be obtained from areas of equal or higher classification\nlocated in another state, in accordance with department approved modeling\nprocedures, provided that an interstate reciprocal trading agreement is in\nplace and the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision are\nmet. (e) 'Ozone\nnonattainment and emission offset location'. Department approved modeling\nprocedures must be used by an applicant to find default acceptable VOC or\nNO\nx\noffset source locations within New York State or to\nperform a case specific contribution demonstration. An emission offset of VOC\nor NO\nx\nis subject to the following: (1)\n\nProposed NSR major modification located\nin an ozone nonattainment area. (i) Intrastate offset sources. An emission offset of VOC or\nNO\nx\nbe obtained from: ('a')\nthe same ozone nonattainment area; or\n('b')\nother ozone nonattainment\nareas of equal or higher classification, if emissions from such other areas\ncontribute to a violation of the NAAQS for ozone in the nonattainment area\nwhere the proposed NSR major modification is to be located. (ii)\n\nInterstate offset sources. An emission\noffset may be obtained from ozone nonattainment areas of equal or higher\nclassification in another state, if emissions from such other areas contribute\nto a violation of the NAAQS for ozone in the nonattainment area where the\nproposed NSR major modification is to be located and an interstate reciprocal\ntrading agreement is in place. Department approved modeling procedures may be\nused by an applicant to perform a case specific contribution\ndemonstration. (2)\n\nProposed NSR major modification located in an attainment area of the state\nwithin the ozone transport region. An emission offset of VOC or\nNO\nx\nmay be obtained from any location within the ozone\ntransport region in New York State. Such an offset may also be obtained from\nanother state in the ozone transport region, provided that an interstate\nreciprocal trading agreement is in place. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
