(1)\n\nSection\n1105-A\nof the Tax Law provides for a\nreduction in the four-percent statewide sales tax rate imposed under sections\n1105 (a)\nand\n1105 (b)\nof the Tax Law and in the four-percent statewide\ncompensating use tax rate imposed under section\n1110 (a)\nof the Tax Law, as\nset forth in subdivision (c) of this section, on the receipts from every sale, other than for resale, used for residential purposes of: (i) fuel oil (except diesel motor\nfuel); (ii)\ncoal; (iii)\nwood (for heating purposes\nonly); (iv)\npropane (except when\nsold in containers of less than 100 pounds); (v) natural gas; (vi)\nelectricity; (vii)\nsteam; and\n(viii)\ngas, electric and steam services. For purposes of this regulation, the term\nenergy\nsources\nis used to describe the above- mentioned tangible personal\nproperty and services. (2)\n\nThe reduction in the sales and\ncompensating use tax rates does not apply to those tax rates imposed by\nlocalities, pursuant to article 29 of the Tax Law, nor to the four-percent\nsales and compensating use tax rate in New York City which is imposed by\nsection\n1107\nof the Tax Law. The applicable tax\nrates imposed by localities may be obtained from the Taxpayer's Assistance\n\nBureau at the State Campus in Albany or from any district tax office. (3)\n\nNothing in this section shall be deemed\nto exempt from the tax imposed under section\n1105\nof the Tax Law any transaction which\nmay not be subject to the reduced tax rates set forth in this section and under\nsection\n1105-A\nof the Tax Law. (b) Transitional\nprovisions. (1)\n\nAll sales of energy\nsources shall be subject to tax at the rate in effect on the date of delivery\nor transfer of possession, even if made or rendered under a contract entered\ninto prior to the effective date of the tax rate reduction. (2)\n\nWhere energy sources are sold on a\nmonthly, quarterly or other term basis and the bills for such sales are based\non meter readings, the tax rate reduction shall not apply unless more than one\nhalf of the days included in the billing period are for days on and after the\neffective date of the tax rate reduction. (c) Tax rates and effective\ndates. The reduced State tax rates and effective dates are: (1)\n0 percent commencing on and after October\n1, 1980; (2)\n21/2 percent\ncommencing January 1, 1980 and ending September 30, 1980; and\n(3)\n3 percent commencing January 1, 1979 and\nending December 31, 1979. (d) Definitions. (1)\n\nThe term\nresidential\npurposes\nmeans any use of a structure or part of a structure as a\nplace of abode, maintained by or for a person, whether or not owned by such\nperson, on other than a temporary or transient basis with the exclusion of\naccommodations subject to tax under subdivision (e) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law. (2)\n\nThe term\nnonresidential\npurposes\nmeans any use other than for residential purposes, as defined\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision, including any use in the conduct of a\ntrade, business or profession, whether such trade, business or profession is\ncarried on by the owner of the structure or some other person. (3)\n\nThe term\ncommon area\nmeans any area of the premises of a structure used without distinction for both\nresidential and nonresidential purposes. (e) Certification and\nallocation. (1)\n\nPurchases of energy\nsources used exclusively for residential purposes shall receive the reduced tax\nrate without the necessity of certification. (2)\n\nWhere energy sources billed on a single\nmeter or in a lump sum are used for both residential and nonresidential\npurposes, and the residential purposes constitute 75 percent or more of the\nusage, the entire amount billed shall be taxed at the reduced sales tax rate\nwithout certification. See paragraph (5) of this subdivision to determine the\npercentage of residential use. (3)\n\nWhere energy sources billed on a single meter or in a lump sum are used for\nboth residential and nonresidential and less than 75 percent of the usage is\nfor residential purposes, the purchaser is entitled to the reduced tax rate on\nonly the percentage of energy sources used for residential purposes. This\npercentage shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision and shall be rounded off to the nearest 10 percent. A certificate\nshall be filed in the form provided and shall be given by the purchaser to the\nsupplier of the energy sources. In the absence of such a certificate, the\nsupplier of energy sources shall collect the full tax on the entire\nusage. (4)\n\nWhere a structure is\nexclusively used for nonresidential purposes, no certification or statement is\nrequired, since no eligibility for a reduced sales tax rate shall exist for\npurchases of energy sources and services. (5)\n\nTo determine the percentage of the area\nof a structure used for residential purposes, the following formula shall be\nused by the purchaser of the energy sources and services: total area of space\nused for residential purposes, excluding common areas, divided by the total\narea (residential and nonresidential), excluding common areas, equals the\npercentage rounded off to the nearest 10 percent applicable to use for\nresidential purposes. Thus, if the percentage before rounding is 74.9 percent, the percentage when rounded is 70 percent. (6)\n\nCertifications, when needed, may be\nobtained from the Taxpayer's Assistance Bureau at the State Campus in Albany, from any district tax office or from the supplier of the energy sources and\nservices. (f) Customer classification. (1)\n\nVendors of\nenergy sources which are regulated by the New York State Public Service\n\nCommission and which have on file therewith a tariff or rate schedule which\nclassifies its customer either as residential or nonresidential, may request\nfrom the Department of Taxation and Finance approval to use such\nclassifications for determining the eligibility of its customer for a reduced\nsales tax rate without certification. (2)\n\nAll other vendors of energy sources may\nuse from their records any classifications presently in use which classifies a\ncustomer as either a residential or nonresidential customer. If there is no\nsuch classification, the vendor is required to make a visual inspection of the\nstructure to determine his customer's classification in accordance with\nsubdivision (e) of this section for eligibility for a reduced sales tax rate\nwithout certification. (3)\n\nEvery\nsupplier of energy sources who has received from his customer a certification\nclaiming eligibility for a reduced sales tax rate shall not be held liable, except in the case of his fraud, for any misrepresentations made by the\ncustomer on the certification or for any tax not collected by granting the\nsales tax rate reduction based on such certification. (4)\n\nWhere a customer is eligible for the\nreduced tax rate, as a residential customer described in paragraph (1) or (2)\nof subdivision (e) of this section, but the supplier of energy sources has not\nclassified him as a residential user, the customer should furnish the supplier\nwith a certification. (g) Collection of tax. (1)\n\nEvery vendor, making a sale of energy\nsources to a customer who is classified as a residential customer, shall\ncollect the sales tax at the reduced sales tax rate on such customer's total\npurchase. (2)\n\nEvery supplier of\nenergy sources who has received from his customer a certification shall collect\nthe sales tax at the reduced rate on the portion of the purchase shown as being\nused for residential purposes and shall collect the tax at the full rate on the\nremainder which is used for nonresidential purposes. (3)\n\nEvery vendor making sales of energy\nsources which are used for nonresidential purposes shall collect the sales tax\nat the full rate. (h) Reporting and remitting. Every vendor making sales of energy sources which are taxed\nat a reduced rate shall, in addition to the usual reporting form, complete and\nfile a Schedule B as part of its sales tax report and remit the appropriate tax\ntherewith.
