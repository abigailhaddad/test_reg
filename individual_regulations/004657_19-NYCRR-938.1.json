  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 938.1 - Intent and Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Public\n\nIntegrity Reform Act of 2011 (\"PIRA\") (Chapter 399, Laws of 2011) established\nthe Joint Commission on Public Ethics (\"Commission\"). The Commission regulates\nlobbyists and their clients in New York State through the disclosure and\nenforcement provisions set in Legislative Law article one-A. PIRA amended\n\nLegislative Law article one-A by enacting unprecedented disclosure requirements\nto better inform the public about efforts to influence governmental\ndecision-making through increased transparency, including the source of funding\ndisclosure requirement set forth in Legislative Law § 1-h(c)(4) and\n§1-j(c)(4). Effective June 1, 2012, the source of funding amendments\nrequired lobbyists who lobby on their own behalf and clients, who devote\nsubstantial resources to lobbying activity in New York State, to make publicly\navailable each source of funding over $5,000 for such lobbying. The legislation\nintended for these new disclosures to provide the public with more information\nregarding the actual entities and individuals that support lobbying campaigns\nin New York State. (b) PIRA also\nrequired that the Commission issue regulations implementing the new law's\nsource of funding provisions. These regulations will clarify the source of\nfunding reporting requirements, the procedure by which individuals and\norganizations may apply to the Commission for an exemption from disclosure, and\nthe procedure by which they may appeal the Commission's denial from exemption\nthrough a review by an independent judicial hearing officer. To fulfill the\nlegislative intent, the Commission has sought the broadest determination\npossible of what must be disclosed pursuant to statute and as allowed by\nlaw. (c) Part D of S.8160/A.10742\n(2016) decreases the filing threshold for total lobbying expenditures to\n$15,000, from $50,000, and the minimum contribution amount for disclosing a\nsource to $2,500, from $5,000. Further, it excluded funds received for\nmembership dues, fees, and assessments from the contributions that must be\ndisclosed, while continuing to require the donor to be identified as a\nsource. (d) The provisions of\nsection\n938.11\nof this Part apply only to\nthe Client Semi-Annual Report due January 15, 2017. For purposes of the January\n15, 2017 Client Semi-Annual Report, all definitions and provisions of section\n938.11\nof this Part supersede any\nparallel definitions or provisions contained in this Part. (e) The amended terms of this regulation\nshall become effective upon the effective date of Part D, S. 8160/A.10742\n(2016). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
