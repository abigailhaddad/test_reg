  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 1.9 - Use of cash as consideration for an acquisition effected under section 143-a of the banking law\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was asked whether part of the consideration\ngiven to a shareholder of a bank to be acquired pursuant to section 143-a of\nthe New York State Banking Law may consist of cash. Section 143-a reads, in\nrelevant part, as follows: \"Such plan shall be in form satisfactory to the\n\nSuperintendent, shall specify each corporation the stock of which is to be\nacquired by the company and shall prescribe the terms and conditions of the\nacquisition and the mode of carrying it into effect, including the manner of\nexchanging the shares of each of the corporations for shares or other\nsecurities of the company.\" (emphasis added)\n\nThe department noted that the language quoted above does not\nrefer to the payment of cash as consideration for any acquisition effected\npursuant to this section. However, the purpose of the sentence is to detail the\ncontents of the plan to be submitted to the Superintendent and not to prescribe\nthe form of consideration that may be used in the acquisition. The legislative history of section 143-a indicates that its\npurpose was to facilitate the acquisition of banks by the exchange of stock and\nto eliminate the need for the use of \"phantom bank\" procedures. Nothing in the\nlegislative history of section 143-a suggests that the legislators intended to\nlimit the form of consideration which could be used. Indeed, the reference to\n\"other securities\" would permit notes to be used, and there would be little, if\nany, reason to distinguish between cash and short-term notes in this\ncontext. For the foregoing reasons, the department concluded that the\nconsideration to be paid to the shareholders of a banking institution to be\nacquired pursuant to section\n143-a\nof the\n\nBanking Law may consist of both cash and stock.
