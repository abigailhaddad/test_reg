  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 232-2.5 - Leak inspection and self-monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Leak check requirements. A trained operator must inspect the perc dry cleaning\nsystem for perceptible liquid and vapor leaks and other fugitive emissions, and\nrecord the date of inspection, inspector's initials and the status of each\ncomponent on a checklist supplied by the department. Completed checklists must\nbe kept for at least five years from the date of inspection. (1)\n\nThe perc dry cleaning system must be\nthoroughly inspected, at least weekly, for vapor leaks using one of the\nfollowing devices or methods for detecting vapor leaks: (i) a halogenated-hydrocarbon detector\n(beeper); or\n(ii)\na portable gas\nanalyzer; or\n(iii)\nan alternative\nmethod approved by the department. (2)\n\nAll equipment referenced in paragraph\n(a)(1) of this subdivision must be maintained in good working order and\nproperly calibrated. (b) The following components of the perc dry cleaning system must be inspected\nweekly by a trained operator for perceptible liquid and vapor leaks and for\nproper operation, as required by section\n232-2.6\nof this Subpart (operation\nand maintenance requirements), during that portion of the machine cycle that\nthe component is utilized: (1)\nhose and pipe\nconnections, fittings, couplings and valves; (2)\ndoor gaskets and seatings; (3)\nfilter gaskets and seatings; (4)\npumps; (5)\nsolvent (including spent solvent) tanks\nand containers; (6)\nwater\nseparators; (7)\nstills; and\n(8)\ncartridge filter\nhousings. (c) Carbon\nadsorber vents from external door fans must be tested weekly using colorimetric\ndetector tubes or a portable gas analyzer and noted on the checklist. (d) The refrigerant high and low vapor\npressures, or the temperatures of the vapor stream on the inlet and outlet side\nof a refrigerated condenser, must be measured weekly, and recorded on the\nchecklist. (e) Preparedness and\nprevention equipment as required in section\n232-2.6\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart must be inspected weekly to ensure proper operation and\nmaintenance. A notation must be made on the checklist at the time of\ninspection. (f) For dry cleaning\nmachines equipped with an external door fan, trained operators must use a\nportable velometer or equivalent measurement instrument to measure the inward\nair velocity through the effective door opening to verify compliance with\nsection\n232-2.4\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart. The inward air velocity must be measured weekly and noted on the\nchecklist. (g) Any liquid leak, vapor leak, or malfunction that has been detected by a trained operator must be\nnoted on the checklist and repaired immediately, if possible. If the leak\ncannot be repaired at the time of detection, the leaking component must be\nphysically marked or tagged in a manner that is readily observable and repaired\nwithin 24 hours of detection, unless repair parts are unavailable. (1)\n\nIf repair parts are not available at the\nfacility, the parts must be ordered within two working days of detecting such a\nleak. Such repair parts must be installed within five working days after\nreceipt. Equipment with a leak that has not been repaired by the end of the\n15th working day after detection must not be operated until the leak is\nrepaired, unless the facility owner or operator is granted a leak-repair\nextension from the department. (2)\n\nThe department may grant a leak-repair extension to a facility owner or\noperator for a single period of 30 days or less, if the department makes these\nfindings: (i) the delay in repairing the leak\ncould not have been avoided by action taken by the facility owner or\noperator; (ii)\nall reasonable\npreventive measures were taken and prompt action was taken to initiate the\nrepair; (iii)\nthe leak will not\nsignificantly increase perc exposure in or near the facility; and\n(iv)\nthe facility is in compliance with all\nother requirements of this section and has a history of\ncompliance. (3)\n\nSuch an\nextension may be granted verbally, but must be followed up by a written\nconfirmation within three days. (4)\n\nOnce a repair is completed, the completion date must be recorded on the\nchecklist. (5)\n\nWhere a hazard is\nimminent or has already occurred, remedial action must be taken\nimmediately. (6)\n\nAll uncontainable\nreleases, fires or explosions must be reported immediately to the department\nand appropriate emergency response agencies. (h) A measured fugitive perc emission\nconcentration of 50 ppm or greater emanating from any unintended openings in\nthe dry cleaning system shall be considered an excessive vapor leak, treated as\na violation, and subject to department enforcement action if detected by an\ninspector and not physically marked or tagged by a trained operator prior to\nthe inspection; except for short-term maintenance operations involving the\nopening of dry cleaning system components for inspection or repair. (i) Owner drum testing. In addition to the\nrequired yearly drum testing by compliance inspectors (inspector drum testing), all operational fourth generation perc dry cleaning machines must be tested by\nthe owner or owner's representative at the facilities and frequencies specified\nin paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision. These tests must be conducted at\nthe immediate completion of the drying cycle and prior to the activation of any\nfugitive emissions control system. Any fugitive emissions control system, normally activated upon door opening, must be deactivated prior to this test. Testing must be conducted when machines are filled to at least 80 percent of\ncapacity using proper sampling procedures and a colorimetric detector tube\nsampling pump, or photo ionization detector, in good working order. During this\ntest, the sampling probe must be inserted into the rear of the drum and above\nthe clothes at the immediate completion of the drying cycle. Any sampled\nconcentration above the regulatory limit specified in section\n232-2.4\n(a)(5)\nwill\nnot be treated as a violation if the machine is brought into compliance and\nthen retested within 45 days of detection. This compliance and testing deadline\nmay be extended beyond 45 days if requested and reasonably justified by the\nowner and approved by the department. Testing results and any corrective action\ntaken must be recorded on the checklist supplied by the department. (1)\n\nCo-located residential and co-located\ncommercial non-major dry cleaning facilities. Owner drum testing must be\nconducted monthly on all operational fourth generation machines, not equipped\nwith an external door fan, at co-located residential and commercial non-major\nfacilities. Owner drum testing is not required for perc dry cleaning machines\nat stand-alone non-major facilities. (2)\n\nMajor dry cleaning facilities. Owner drum\ntesting must be conducted weekly on all operational fourth generation machines, with or without an external door fan, that were installed after September 22, 1993 at all major facilities.
