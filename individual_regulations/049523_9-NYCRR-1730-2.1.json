The \"caused by accident\" phrase should be\neliminated from the ensuring agreement and the word \"occurrence\"\nsubstituted. (d) Fidelity bond. Housing companies shall obtain a blanket fidelity bond with limits approved by\nthe division. The housing company shall obtain a fidelity bond to cover every\nposition in which an employee or agent has possession, custody or control of\nfunds or property. The blanket position form of bond is preferable. (e) Boiler. (1)\n\nFor projects where steam boilers are\ninstalled, the housing company shall carry boiler insurance. Projects using hot\nwater boilers may obtain boiler insurance. Furnace explosion coverage need not\nbe provided since it is available under the extended coverage endorsement\nattached to the fire policy. (2)\n\nThe amount of insurance to be carried, which shall be determined by the housing\ncompany and approved by the division, shall be sufficient to cover maximum\nprobable damage to property of project and property of others that may be\nexposed to any accident occurring through operation of boiler\nequipment. (f) Money and\nsecurities. The housing company shall obtain coverage for loss of money and\nsecurities, both inside and outside the premises, in an amount sufficient to\ncover the full value of cash securities likely to be located on the premises at\nany one time. (g) Self-insurance. A\nhousing company may, with the prior consent of the division, act as a\nself-insurer. No company shall transfer from or to a self-insurance program\nwithout the prior consent of the division. (h) Insurance reserves. Reserves shall be\nmaintained for all insurance premiums on policies written for more than a\none-year term. (i) Insurance to be\nsupplied by contractor, concessionaire, etc. (1)\n\nIn the event that repair, alteration, exterminating, or any other work or services shall be performed for the housing\ncompany, the company shall require all firms performing such operations to\nsupply evidence that workmen's compensation and public liability insurance, with limits of at least $1,000,000 per occurrence/$2,000,000 total aggregate\nfor bodily injury, are in force. (2)\n\nThe housing company shall require that\ncertificates or copies of such policies be submitted as evidence that such\ninsurance is in force. No contractor shall be allowed to commence operations\nuntil the housing company has satisfied itself that there has been compliance\nwith this provision. (3)\n\nBefore any\ncontractors commence construction operations and before materials are delivered\nto project site, a builder's risk policy must be secured. This policy shall\neither be obtained by housing company or supplied by contractor. Coverage for\nfull insurable interest must be maintained at all times and shall include\nmaterials on project site. Either \"completed value\" or \"monthly reporting\" form\nmay be used; the \"completed value\" form however, is preferable because it\nobviates the necessity for filing monthly reports covering value of completed\nwork. (4)\n\nMaterial stored on\nproject site will be covered under builder's risk policy. If these materials\nhave been paid for by the housing company, the company shall effect such\ninsurance; otherwise the coverage shall be obtained from the\ncontractor. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
