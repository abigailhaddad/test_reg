Tit. 6 §§ 242-8.1 - General requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe owners and operators, and to the extent applicable, the CO\n2\nauthorized account representative of a\nCO\n2\nbudget unit, shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements as provided in this Subpart and all\napplicable sections of 40 CFR part\n75\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). Where\nreferenced in the Subpart, the monitoring requirements of 40 CFR part\n75\n(see\n\nTable 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) shall be\nadhered to in a manner consistent with the purpose of monitoring and reporting\nCO\n2\nmass emissions pursuant to this Subpart. For\npurposes of complying with such requirements, the definitions in section\n242-1.2\nof this Part and in\n40\nCFR\n72.2\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this\n\nTitle) shall apply, and the terms ''affected unit,'' ''designated\nrepresentative,'' and ''continuous emissions monitoring system'' (or ''CEMS'')\nin 40 CFR part\n75\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title) shall be replaced\nby the terms ''CO\n2\nbudget unit,''\n''CO\n2\nauthorized account representative,'' and\n''continuous emissions monitoring system'' (or ''CEMS''), respectively, as\ndefined in section\n242-1.2\nof this Part. For units not\nsubject to an acid rain emissions limitation, the term \"Administrator' in 40\nCFR part\n75\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title) shall be replaced with\n\"the department or its agent.\" Owners or operators of a\nCO\n2\nbudget unit who monitor a\nnon-CO\n2\nbudget unit pursuant to the common, multiple, or\nbypass stack procedures in\n40\nCFR\n75.72(b)(2)(ii), or\n40 CFR\n75.16(b)(2)(ii)(B)\nas\npursuant to\n40 CFR\n75.13\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this\n\nTitle), for purposes of complying with this Part, shall monitor and report\nCO\n2\nmass emissions from such\nnon-CO\n2\nbudget unit according to the procedures for\nCO\n2\nbudget units established in sections\n242-8.1\nthrough\n242-8.7\nof this Subpart. (a) 'Requirements for installation, certification, and data accounting'. The owner or operator of each\nCO\n2\nbudget unit must meet the following requirements.

Equation G1 in Appendix G shall not be used to determine\nCO\n2\nemissions under this Part. This may require systems\nto monitor CO\n2\nconcentration, stack gas flow rate, O\n2\nconcentration, heat input, and fuel flow\nrate. (2)\n\nSuccessfully complete all\ncertification tests required under section\n242-8.2\nof this Subpart and meet\nall other requirements of this Subpart and 40 CFR part\n75\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) applicable to\nthe monitoring systems under paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nRecord, report and quality-assure the\ndata from the monitoring systems under paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (b) 'Compliance dates' The owner or operator shall meet the monitoring system\ncertification and other requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this\nsection on or before the following dates. The owner or operator shall record, report and quality-assure the data from the monitoring systems under paragraph\n(a)(1) of this section on and after the following dates.

(2)\n\nThe\nowner or operator of a CO budget unit subject to the applicability provisions\nin paragraph 242-1.4(a)(2) of this Part, except for a CO budget unit under\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision, that commenced commercial operation before\n\nJuly 1, 2019, must comply with the requirements of this Subpart by January 1, 2021. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator of\na CO\n2\nbudget unit that commences commercial operation on\nor after July 1, 2019 must comply with the requirements of this Subpart by the\nlater of the following dates: (i) January 1, 2020; or\n(ii)\nthe earlier of: (a) 90 unit operating days after the date on\nwhich the unit commences commercial operation; or\n(b) 180 calendar days after the date on which\nthe unit commences commercial operation. (4)\n\nFor the owner or operator of a\nCO\n2\nbudget unit for which construction of a new stack or\nflue installation is completed after the applicable deadline under paragraph\n(1) or (2) of this subdivision by the earlier of: (i) 90 unit operating days after the date on\nwhich emissions first exit to the atmosphere through the new stack or flue; or\n(ii)\n180 calendar days after the\ndate on which emissions first exit to the atmosphere through the new stack or\nflue.
