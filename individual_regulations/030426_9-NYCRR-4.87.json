  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.87 - Executive order no. 87: prescribing procedures to allocate the unified state bond volume ceiling under the tax reform act of 1986\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (\"act\") establishes a\nunified statewide bond ceiling (\"statewide ceiling\") for tax exempt private\nactivity bonds and the private use portion of a governmental use bond on a per\ncapita basis for New York State; WHEREAS, The statewide ceiling applies to certain tax\nexempt private activity bonds and, under certain circumstances and to a certain\nextent, with respect to the nonqualified amount of an issue of governmental use\nbonds (together \"covered bonds\") issued by the State and its agencies (\"State\nagencies\"), agencies issuing on behalf of local governments (\"local agencies\")\nand other issuers (\"other issuers\"); WHEREAS, The statewide ceiling for covered bonds for New\n\nYork State is $75 per resident for the balance of the calendar year 1986 and\n$75 per resident for calendar year 1987, based on the most recent population\nestimate provided by the United States Bureau of the Census before the\nbeginning of the calendar year to which the limitation applies; WHEREAS, The application of the statewide ceiling to\nprojects and programs financed by covered bonds in New York State will require\nannual allocation authorizations to State and local agencies and other issuers\nwhich may limit the ability of certain issuers to finance projects and programs\nand will require that all issues of such bonds be coordinated in order to meet\nthe requirements of the act relating to the ceiling; WHEREAS, The State should maximize the public benefit of\ncovered bond issues and minimize conflicts among issuing agencies; WHEREAS, For certain issues the State should maximize the\nimpact of business development and job development incentives particularly on\ndistressed areas of the State; and\nWHEREAS, The act authorizes the governor of each state to\nproclaim a formula for allocating the covered bond volume limit among such\ngovernmental units and other authorities in the state as have authority to\nissue covered bonds; NOW, THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws\nof the State of New York and the Tax Reform Act of 1986, do hereby proclaim and\norder as follows: I. Definitions\nA. Code shall mean the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986. B. Covered bonds shall\nmean those tax exempt private activity bonds and that portion of the\nnonqualified amount of an issue of governmental use bonds to which an\nallocation of the statewide ceiling is necessary to preserve the tax exempt\nstatus of such bonds under the code. C. Issuer shall mean a local agency, State\nagency or other issuer. D. Local\nagency shall mean an industrial development agency established or operating\npursuant to article 18-A of the General Municipal Law, the Troy Industrial\n\nDevelopment Authority and the Auburn Industrial Development\n\nAuthority. E. Other issuer shall\nmean any agency, political subdivision or other entity, other than a local\nagency or State agency, that is authorized to issue covered bonds. F. Qualified small issue bonds shall mean\nqualified small issue bonds, as defined in section 144(a) of the\ncode. G. State agency shall mean\nthe State of New York, New York State Energy Research and Development\n\nAuthority, New York Job Development Authority, New York State Environmental\n\nFacilities Corporation, New York State Urban Development Corporation and its\nsubsidiaries, Battery Park City Authority, Port Authority of New York and New\n\nJersey, Power Authority of the State of New York, Dormitory Authority of the\n\nState of New York, New York State Housing Finance Agency, State of New York\n\nMortgage Agency and any other State agency designated by the\n\nGovernor. H. Statewide ceiling\nshall mean for any calendar year the state ceiling (as such term is used in\nsection 146 of the code) applicable to New York State. II. Aggregate Amount of Covered Bonds\nA. Covered bond limit for local agencies--in\ngeneral. The covered bond limit for local agencies for any calendar year shall\nbe an amount which bears the same ratio to two fifths (40 percent) of the\nstatewide ceiling as the population of the jurisdiction of such local agency\nbears to the population of the entire State. B. Covered bond limit for State agencies--in\ngeneral. The covered bond limit for all State agencies for any calendar year\nshall be two fifths (40 percent) of the statewide ceiling. The Director of the\n\nBudget shall administer allocations under the State agency limit and may grant\nan allocation to any State agency. C. Overlapping jurisdictions. In a geographic\narea represented by a county local agency and one or more subcounty local\nagencies, the allocation granted by paragraph A of this section with respect to\nsuch area shall be split one-half to the county local agency and one-half to\nthe subcounty local agency or agencies. Where there is a local agency for the\nbenefit of a village within the geographic area of a town for the benefit of\nwhich there is a local agency, the allocation of the village local agency shall\nbe based on the population of the geographic area of the village, and the\nallocation of the town local agency shall be based upon the population of the\ngeographic area of the town outside of the village. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, a local agency may elect to surrender all or part of its allocation\nfor such calendar year to another local agency with an overlapping\njurisdiction. Such election shall be made at such time and in such manner as\nthe Commissioner of Commerce shall prescribe. D. Ineligible local agencies. To the extent\nthat any allocation of the covered bond limit would be made by this Order to a\nlocal agency which is ineligible to receive such allocation under the code or\nunder regulations interpreting the state volume cap provisions of the code, such allocation shall instead be made to the political subdivision for whose\nbenefit that local agency was created. E. Municipal reallocation. The chief\nexecutive officer of any political subdivision or, if such political\nsubdivision has no chief executive officer, the governing board of the\npolitical subdivision for the benefit of which a local agency has been\nestablished may withdraw all or any portion of the allocation granted by\nparagraph A of this section to such local agency and reallocate all or any\nportion of such allocation, as well as all or any portion of the allocation\nreceived pursuant to paragraph D of this section, to the political subdivision\nor other issuer established for the benefit of that political subdivision or\nmay assign all or any portion of the allocation received pursuant to paragraph\nD of this section to the local agency created for its benefit. The chief\nexecutive officer or governing board of the political subdivision, as the case\nmay be, shall notify the Commissioner of Commerce of any such\nreallocation. F. Statewide bond\nreserve. One fifth (20 percent) of the statewide ceiling is hereby allocated to\nthe Division of the Budget for a statewide bond reserve to be administered by\nthe Director of the Budget. 1. Allocation of\nthe statewide bond reserve among State and local agencies and other issuers. The Director of the Budget shall transfer a portion of the statewide bond\nreserve to the Commissioner of Commerce for allocation to and use by local\nagencies and other issuers in accordance with the terms of this section. The\nremainder of the statewide bond reserve may be allocated by the Director of the\n\nBudget to State agencies, in accordance with the terms of this\nsection. 2. Allocation of statewide\nbond reserve to local agencies or other issuers. Local agencies or other issuers may at any time apply to\nthe Commissioner of Commerce for an allocation from the statewide bond reserve. Such application shall demonstrate: that in the case of an issue of governmental use bonds, the\nrequested allocation is necessary to preserve its tax-exempt status; that in the case of an issue of covered bonds to be issued\nby a local agency or other issuer prior to the close of the calendar year for\nwhich the allocation is requested, the local agency's or other issuer's\nremaining unused allocation will be insufficient to finance the specific\nproject or projects; and\nthat in the case of an issue of covered bonds (other than\ngovernmental use bonds), the proposed project or projects for which the\nallocation is requested constitute a valid public purpose and, in the case of\nqualified small issue bonds, would contribute to economic development in New\n\nYork State. The Commissioner of Commerce shall not approve any\nallocation from the statewide bond reserve for an issue the proceeds of which\nare to be used directly or indirectly for: a commercial facility more than 25 percent of which is used\nto make retail sales of goods or services to customers who personally visit\nsuch facility to obtain goods or services, unless such facility is to be\nlocated in a chronically depressed area as defined by the Commissioner of\n\nCommerce; a commercial facility more than 25 percent of which is used\nby doctors, lawyers or similar professionals in the course of a business which\nprincipally serves local markets, unless such facility is located in a\nchronically depressed area as defined by the Commissioner of Commerce; a commercial facility primarily used for overnight lodging, unless such facility is located in a chronically depressed area as defined by\nthe Commissioner of Commerce, or unless such facility is primarily used in\nsupport of tourism development as defined by the Commissioner of Commerce; or\na facility licensed and regulated pursuant to article 28\nof the Public Health Law. In reviewing and approving or disapproving applications, the Commissioner of Commerce shall exercise discretion to ensure an equitable\ndistribution of allocations from the statewide bond reserve to local agencies\nand other issuers. Applications for allocations shall be made in such form and\ncontain such information and reports as the Commissioner of Commerce shall\nrequire. 3. Allocation of\nstatewide bond reserve to State agencies. The Director of the Budget may grant\nan allocation from the statewide bond reserve to any State agency. 4. Year-end allocation adjustment. On or\nbefore November 5th of each year, each State agency shall report to the\n\nDirector of the Budget, and each local agency and each other issuer shall\nreport to the Commissioner of Commerce, the amount of bonds subject to\nallocation that will be issued prior to the end of the then current calendar\nyear, and the amount of the issuer's allocation that will remain unused. As of\n\nNovember 20th of each year, the unused portion of each issuer's allocation as\nreported and the unallocated portion of the covered bond limit for State\nagencies shall be added to the statewide bond reserve and shall no longer be\navailable to the issuers except as otherwise provided herein. On or before\n\nDecember 1st of each year, each issuer shall update its report on its bond\nissuance plans and any additional portion of each issuer's allocation that will\nremain unused as so reported shall be added to the statewide bond reserve as of\n\nDecember 1st of such year. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Commissioner\nof Commerce determines that a local agency or other issuer has overestimated\nthe amount of bonds subject to allocation that will be issued prior to the end\nof the calendar year, he may withdraw the amount of the allocation to such\nlocal agency or other issuer represented by such overestimation by notice to\nthe local agency or other issuer and add such allocation to the statewide bond\nreserve. G. Carry-forward of allocation. 1. No local\nagency or other issuer shall exercise its option to carry forward a portion of\nits annual allocation for use in future years (pursuant to section 146[f] of\nthe code) without the prior approval of the Commissioner of Commerce. No State\nagency shall exercise such an option or elect to issue or carry forward\nmortgage credit certificates without the prior approval of the Director of the\n\nBudget. 2. On or before November\n20th of each year, each State agency seeking to carry forward an allocation for\nuse in future years shall make a request for such a carry-forward to the\n\nDirector of the Budget. A later request may also be considered by the director. The director may authorize or file a carry-forward for any State\nagency. 3. On or before November\n20th of each year, each local agency or other issuer seeking to carry forward\nan allocation for use in future years shall make a request for such a\ncarry-forward to the Commissioner of Commerce. A later request may also be\nconsidered by the commissioner. The commissioner may authorize a carry-forward\nfor any local agency or other issuer. H. Access to employment opportunities. It is\nthe policy of New York State to assure that the use of qualified small issue\nbonds results in the creation of new job opportunities for poor and chronically\nunemployed New Yorkers. 1. All issuers shall\nrequire that any new employment opportunities created in connection with\nindustrial or commercial projects financed through the issuance of qualified\nsmall issue bonds shall be listed with the New York State Department of Labor, Job Service Division, and with the administrative entity of the service\ndelivery area created pursuant to the Job Training Partnership Act ( P.L. 97-300) in which the project is located. Such listing shall be in a manner and\nform prescribed by the Commissioner of Commerce. 2. Each State agency shall further require\nthat, to the extent practicable and feasible, at least 10 percent of any new\njobs created in connection with an industrial or commercial project financed\nthrough the issuance of qualified small issue bonds by such agency in amounts\nof $1 million or more shall be filled by persons eligible for service under the\n\nJob Training Partnership Act. 3. Issuers of qualified small issue bonds are required to monitor compliance with\nthe provisions of this section as prescribed by the Commissioner of\n\nCommerce. 4. Nothing in this\nsection shall be construed to require users of qualified small issue bonds to\nviolate any existing collective bargaining agreement with respect to the hiring\nof new employees. 5. Failure on the\npart of any user of qualified small issue bonds to comply with the requirements\nof this section shall not affect the allocation of bonding authority to the\nissuing agency or the validity or tax-exempt status of such bonds. III. Procedures and\n\nGuidelines\n\nThe Director of the Budget and Commissioner of Commerce are\nauthorized and directed to establish procedures and guidelines to implement the\nprovisions of this Order. Such procedures and guidelines shall set forth the\namount of the statewide ceiling and provide guidance for issuers, procedures\nfor making applications, standards and criteria for granting approvals, allocations, carry-forwards of allocations and certifications, and a method for\ntracking the issuance of covered bonds by issuers. Such procedures and\nguidelines may address any other matters the Director of the Budget and\n\nCommissioner of Commerce deem appropriate. IV. Effectiveness\n\nThis Order shall take effect immediately. Nothing contained\nin this Order shall be deemed to supersede, alter or impair any provision of\n(i) the Executive Order prescribing procedures to allocate the private activity\nbond volume ceiling under the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 or (ii) the Tax\n\nReform Act of 1986 (other than the provisions of section 146[b] and [c] of the\ncode) or any regulations promulgated thereunder. If any provision of this Order\nis adjudged or ruled invalid, such judgment or ruling shall not affect any\nother provisions of this Order. V. Retroactivity\nA. Prior issues. For covered bonds subject to\nallocation which were issued by an issuer after August 15, 1986 and prior to\nthe effective date of this Order, there shall be allocated to such issuer the\namount of such covered bonds in accordance with the terms of this section. There shall be allocated to a local agency, pursuant to paragraph A of section\nII of this Order, the amount of covered bonds subject to allocation which were\nissued by such local agency after August 15, 1986 and prior to the effective\ndate of this Order. Any allocation to a local agency pursuant to paragraph A of\nsection II of this Order shall be reduced by the amount of covered bonds\nsubject to allocation which were issued by such local agency after August 15, 1986 and prior to the effective date of this Order. There shall be allocated to\na State agency pursuant to paragraph B of section II of this Order the amount\nof covered bonds subject to allocation which were issued by such State agency\nafter August 15, 1986 and prior to the effective date of this Order. If the\namount of covered bonds issued after August 15, 1986 and prior to the effective\ndate of this Order by a local agency exceeds the allocation pursuant to such\nparagraph A, or in the case of such covered bonds issued by a State agency the\nallocation pursuant to such paragraph B, there shall be allocated to such local\nagency or State agency, as the case may be, from the statewide bond reserve the\namount of such excess. There shall also be allocated to any other issuer from\nthe statewide bond reserve the amount of any covered bonds subject to\nallocation which were issued by such other issuer after August 15, 1986 and\nprior to the effective date of this Order. B. Reports. On or before November 1, 1986, each State agency shall report to the Director of Budget, and each local agency\nand other issuer shall report to the Commissioner of Commerce, the amount of\ncovered bonds subject to allocation in accordance with the terms of this\nsection which were issued after August 15, 1986 and prior to the effective date\nof this Order.
