Tit. 14 § 680.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Within the\ncontinuum of human services offered by OPWDD (see section\n680.13\nof this Part), the\nspecialty hospital (see section\n680.13\n) is designed as the most\nintensive provider of care for individuals with developmental disability and\nhealth care problems (see section\n680.13\n) through an integrated\ncombination of assessment services, active programming, continuing medical\ntreatment, and residential arrangements. (b) The specialty hospital serves as a\ntransitional setting which has as its primary goal the prevention, amelioration, or limitation of health care problems for individuals with\ndevelopmental disabilities to enable the movement of such individuals to less\nrestrictive environments. (c) Because active programming, medical treatment and residence are combined in a\nsingle setting, the specialty hospital is considered as the most restrictive\nenvironment which offers 24-hour care to people with developmental disabilities\nwhose health problems, rather than developmental disability\nper\nse, prevent placement in an alternative, less restrictive\nplacement. (d) Individuals admitted\nto a specialty hospital shall have a previously established diagnosis of\ndevelopmental disability as determined by the OPWDD through the eligibility\nprocess (see section\n680.13\nof this Part) and shall\nrequire: (1)\nactive programming (see section\n680.13\n) for their developmental\ndisabilities; and\n(2)\nindividualized attention for more than three hours per day for health care\nproblems. (e) Services\nwithin a specialty hospital shall be oriented toward ameliorating the health\ncare problem(s) preventing a n individual's movement to the least restrictive\ntreatment alternative (see section\n680.13\nof this Part). Therefore, health care problems preventing such movement shall be identified for\nindividuals prior to their admission to a specialty hospital. Services focused\non these identified problems shall be delivered with the frequency and\nintensity necessary to affect a rapid transition to less restrictive treatment\nalternatives. In general, comprehensive programming aimed toward a general\nincrease in all aspects of individual functioning is not the primary emphasis\nof specialty hospitals. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.

Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. (a) Within the continuum of human services offered by OPWDD (see section\n680.13\nof this Part), the specialty hospital (see section\n680.13\n) is designed as the most intensive provider of care for individuals with developmental disability and health care problems (see section\n680.13\n) through an integrated combination of assessment services, active programming, continuing medical treatment, and residential arrangements. (b) The specialty hospital serves as a transitional setting which has as its primary goal the prevention, amelioration or limitation of health care problems for individuals with developmental disabilities to enable the movement of such individuals to less restrictive environments. (c) Because active programming, medical treatment and residence are combined in a single setting, the specialty hospital is considered as the most restrictive environment which offers 24-hour care to people with developmental disabilities whose health problems, rather than developmental disability\nper se, prevent placement in an alternative, less restrictive placement. (d) Individuals admitted to a specialty hospital shall have a previously established diagnosis of developmental disability (see section\n680.13\n) and shall require: (1)\nactive programming (see section\n680.13\n) for their developmental disabilities; and\n(2)\nindividualized attention for more than three hours per day for health care problems. (e) Services within a specialty hospital shall be oriented toward ameliorating the health care problem(s) preventing a client's movement to the least restrictive treatment alternative (see section\n680.13\n). Therefore, health care problems preventing such movement shall be identified for individuals prior to their admission to a specialty hospital. Services focused on these identified problems shall be delivered with the frequency and intensity necessary to affect a rapid transition to less restrictive treatment alternatives. In general, comprehensive programming aimed toward a general increase in all aspects of individual functioning is not the primary emphasis of specialty hospitals. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
