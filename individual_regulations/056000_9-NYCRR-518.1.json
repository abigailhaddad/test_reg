  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 518.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n\nSubdivisions (a) and (b) of this section discuss the two\narticles of the code that are located in the punitive article part of the code, but which are not punitive as such: ML, 130.73, principals; and ML, 130.75, lesser included offenses. N.Y.R.C.M. 307 prescribes rules for preferral of\ncharges. The discussion under that rule explains how to allege violations under\nthe code using the format of charge and specification. Beginning with\nsubdivision (c) of this section, the punitive articles of the code are\ndiscussed using the following sequence: Text of the article\n\nElements of the offense or offenses\n\nExplanation\n\nLesser included offenses\n\nSample specifications\n\nThe maximum punishment for each offense under the code is\nthat which is the jurisdictional limit of the court-martial before which the\ncase is being heard (see N.Y.R.C.M. 1002). (a) Principals. [ML, 130.73]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who: (1)\ncommits an offense punishable by this\ncode, or aids, abets, counsels, commands, or procures its commission; or\n(2)\ncauses an act to be done\nwhich if directly performed by him would be punishable by this code; is a\nprincipal.\"\n(2)\n\nExplanation. (i) Purpose. 130.73, ML does not\ndefine an offense. Its purpose is to make clear that a person need not\npersonally perform the acts necessary to constitute an offense to be guilty of\nit. A person who aids, abets, counsels, commands, or procures the commission of\nan offense, or who causes act to be done which, if done by that person\ndirectly, would be an offense if equally guilty of the offense as one who\ncommits it directly, and may be punished to the same extent. ML, 130.73\neliminates the common law distinctions between principal in the first degree\n(\"perpetrator\"); principal in the second degree (one who aids, counsels, commands, or encourages the commission of an offense and who is present at the\nscene of the crime - commonly known as an \"aider and abettor\"); and accessory\nbefore the fact (one who aids, counsels, commands, or encourages the commission\nof an offense and who is not present at the scene of the crime). All of these\nare now \"principals.\"\n(ii)\n\nWho may\nbe liable for an offense. (a) Perpetrator. A\nperpetrator is one who actually commits the offense, either by the\nperpetrator's own hand, or by causing an offense to be committed by knowingly\nor intentionally inducing or setting in motion acts by an animate or inanimate\nagency or instrumentality which result in the commission of an offense. For\nexample, a person who knowingly conceals contraband drugs in an automobile, and\nthen induces another person, who is unaware and has no reason to know of the\npresence of drugs, to drive the automobile onto a military installation, is, although not present in the automobile, guilty of wrongful introduction of\ndrugs onto a military installation. (On these facts, the driver would be guilty\nof no crime.) Similarly, if, upon orders of a superior, a soldier shot a person\nwho appeared to the soldier to be an enemy, but was known to the superior as a\nfriend, the superior would be guilty of murder (but the soldier would be guilty\nof no offense). (b) Other parties. If one is not a perpetrator, to be guilty of an offense committed by the\nperpetrator, the person must: (1)\nassist, encourage, advise, instigate, counsel, command, or procure another to commit, or assist, encourage, advise, counsel, or command another in the commission of\nthe offense; and\n(2)\nshare in the\ncriminal purpose or design. One who, without knowledge of the criminal venture or plan, unwittingly encourages or renders assistance to another in the commission of an\noffense is not guilty of a crime. See the parentheticals in the examples in\nclause (\na\n) of this subparagraph. In some circumstances, inaction may make one liable as a party, where there is a duty to act. If a\nperson (for example, a security guard) has a duty to interfere in the\ncommission of an offense, but does not interfere, that person is a party to the\ncrime if such noninterference is intended to and does operate as an aid or\nencouragement to the actual perpetrator. (iii)\n\nPresence. (a) Not necessary. Presence at the scene of\nthe crime is not necessary to make one a party to the crime and liable as a\nprincipal. For example, one who, knowing that a person intends to shoot another\nperson and intending that such an assault be carried out, provides the person\nwith a pistol, is guilty of assault when the offense is committed, even though\nnot present at the scene. (b) Not\nsufficient. Mere presence at the scene of a crime does not make one a principal\nunless the requirements of clauses (\na\n) or (\nb\n)\nof this subparagraph have been met. (iv)\n\nParties whose intent differs from the\nperpetrator's. When an offense charged requires proof of a specific intent or\nparticular state of mind as an element, the evidence must prove that the\naccused had that intent or state of mind, whether the accused is charged as a\nperpetrator or and \"other party\" to the crime. It is possible for a party to\nhave a state of mind more or less culpable than the perpetrator of the offense. In such a case, the party may be guilty of a more or less serious offense than\nthat committed by the perpetrator. For example, when a homicide is committed, the perpetrator may act in the heat of sudden passion caused by adequate\nprovocation and be guilty of manslaughter, while the party who, without such\npassion, hands the perpetrator a weapon and encourages the perpetrator to kill\nthe victim, would be guilty of murder. On the other hand, if a party assists a\nperpetrator in an assault on a person who, known only to the perpetrator, is an\nofficer, the party would be guilty only of assault, while the perpetrator would\nbe guilty of assault on an officer. (v) Responsibility for other crimes. A\nprincipal may be convicted of crimes committed by another principal if such\ncrimes are likely to result as a natural and probable consequence of the\ncriminal venture or design. For example, the accused who is a party to a\nburglary is guilty as a principal not only of the offense of burglary, but\nalso, if the perpetrator kills an occupant in the course of the burglary, of\nmurder. (See also subdivision [e] of this section concerning liability for\noffenses committed by co-conspirators.)\n(vi)\n\nPrincipals independently liable. One may\nbe a principal, even if the perpetrator is not identified or prosecuted, or is\nacquitted. (vii)\n\nWithdrawal. A\nperson may withdraw from a common venture or design and avoid liability for any\noffenses committed after the withdrawal. To be effective, the withdrawal must\nmeet the following requirements: (a) it must\noccur before the offense is committed; (b) the assistance, encouragement, advice, instigation, counsel, command, or procurement given by the person must be\neffectively countermanded or negated; and\n(c) the withdrawal must be clearly\ncommunicated to the would-be perpetrators or to appropriate law enforcement\nauthorities in time for the perpetrators to abandon the plan or for law\nenforcement authorities to prevent the offense. (b) Conviction of lesser\nincluded offenses. [ML, 130.75]\n(1)\n\nText. \"An accused may be found guilty of an offense necessarily\nincluded in the offense charged or of an attempt to commit either the offense\ncharged or an offense necessarily included therein.\"\n(2)\n\nExplanation. (i) In general. A lesser offense is included\nin a charged offense when the specification contains allegations which either\nexpressly or by fair implication put the accused on notice to be prepared to\ndefend against it in addition to the offense specifically charged. This\nrequirement of notice may be met when: (a) all\nof the elements of the lesser offense are included in the greater offense, and\nthe common elements are identical (for example, larceny as a lesser included\noffense of robbery); (b) all of the\nelements of the lesser offense are included in the greater offense, but one or\nmore elements is legally less serious; or\n(c) all of the elements of the lesser offense\nare included and necessary parts of the greater offense, but the mental element\nlegally less serious (for example, absence without leave is a lesser included\noffense of desertion). The notice requirement may also be met, depending on the\nallegations in the specification, even though an included offense requires\nproof of an element not required in the offense charged. (ii)\n\nMultiple lesser included\noffenses. When the offense charged is a compound offense comprising two or more\nincluded offenses, an accused may be found guilty of any or all of the offenses\nincluded in the offense charged. (iii)\n\nFindings of guilty to a lesser included\noffense. A court-martial may find an accused not guilty of the offense charged, but guilty of a lesser included offense by the process of exception and\nsubstitution. The court-martial may except (that is, delete) the words in the\nspecification that pertain to the offense charged and, if necessary, substitute\nlanguage appropriate of the lesser included offense. If a court-martial finds\nan accused guilty of a lesser included offense, the finding as to the charge\nshall state a violation of the specific punitive article violated and not a\nviolation of ML, 130.75. (iv)\n\nSpecific lesser included offenses. Specific lesser included offenses, if any, are listed for each offense discussed in this Part, but the lists are not\nall-inclusive. (c) Accessory after the fact. [ML, 130.74]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who, knowing that an\noffense punishable by this code has been committed, receives, comforts, or\nassists the offender in order to hinder or prevent his apprehension, trial, or\npunishment shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that an offense punishable by the code\nwas committed by a certain person; (ii)\nthat the accused knew that this person\nhad committed such offense; (iii)\nthat thereafter the accused received, comforted, or assisted the offender; and\n(iv)\nthat the accused did so\nfor the purpose of hindering or preventing the apprehension, trial, or\npunishment of the offender. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) In general. The assistance given a\nprincipal by an accessory after the fact is not limited to assistance designed\nto effect the escape or concealment of the principal, but also includes acts\nperformed to conceal the commission of the offense by the principal (for\nexample, by concealing evidence of the offense). (ii)\n\nFailure to report offense. The mere\nfailure to report a known offense will not make one an accessory after the\nfact. Such failure may violate a general order or regulation, however, and thus\nconstitute an offense under ML, 130.88 (see subdivision (p) of this section). If the offense involved is a serious offense, failure to report it may\nconstitute the offense of misprision of a serious offense, under ML, 130.115. (See paragraph 95.)\n(iii)\n\nOffense\npunishable by the code. The term\noffense punishable by this\ncode\nin the text of the article means any offense described in the\ncode. (iv)\n\nStatus of principal. The\nprincipal who committed the offense in question need not be subject to the\ncode, but the offense committed must be punishable by the code. (v) Conviction of acquittal of principal. The\nprosecution must prove that a principal committed the offense to which the\naccused is allegedly an accessory after the fact. However, evidence of the\nconviction or acquittal of the principal in a separate trial is not admissible\nto show that the principal did or did not commit the offense. Furthermore, an\naccused may be convicted as an accessory after the fact despite the acquittal\nin a separate trial of the principal whom the accused allegedly comforted, received, or assisted. (vi)\n\nAccessory after the fact not a lesser included offense. The offense of being an\naccessory after the fact is not a lesser included offense of the primary\noffense. (vii)\n\nActual knowledge. Actual knowledge is required but may be proved by circumstantial\nevidence. (4)\n\nLesser\nincluded offense (ML, 130.76 - attempts). (5)\n\nSample specification. In that ______(personal jurisdiction data), knowing that\n(at/on board - location), on or about ______19_, ______had committed an offense\npunishable by the New York Code of Military Justice, to wit: ______, did, (at/on board - location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or\nabout ______19 _, in order to (hinder) (prevent) the (apprehension) (trial)\n(punishment) of the said ______, (receive) (comfort) (assist) the said______, by______. (d) Attempts. [ ML, 130.76]\n(1)\n\nText. \"\n(a) An act, done with specific intent\nto commit an offense under this code, amounting to more than mere preparation\nand tending but failing to effect its commission, is an attempt to commit that\noffense. (b) Any person subject to\nthis code who attempts to commit any offense punishable by this code shall be\npunished as a court martial may direct, unless otherwise specifically\nprescribed. (c) Any person subject\nto this code may be convicted of an attempt to commit an offense although it\nappears on the trial that the offense was consummated.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that the accused did a certain overt\nact; (ii)\nthat the act was done\nwith the specific intent to commit a certain offense under the code; (iii)\nthat the act amounted to more than mere\npreparation; and\n(iv)\nthat the act\napparently tended to effect the commission of the intended offense. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) In general. To constitute an attempt\nthere must be a specific intent to commit the offense accompanied by an overt\nact which directly tends to accomplish the unlawful purpose. (ii)\n\nMore than preparation. Preparation\nconsists of devising or arranging the means or measures necessary for the\ncommission of the offense. The overt act required goes beyond preparatory steps\nand is a direct movement toward the commission of the offense. For example, a\npurchase of matches with the intent to burn a haystack is not an attempt to\ncommit arson, but it is an attempt to commit arson to apply a burning match to\na haystack, even if no fire results. The overt act need not be the last act\nessential to the consummation of the offense. For example, an accused could\ncommit an overt act, and then voluntarily decide not to go through with the\nintended offense. An attempt would nevertheless have been committed, for the\ncombination of a specific intent to commit an offense, plus the commission of\nan overt act directly tending to accomplish it, constitutes the offense of\nattempt. Failure to complete the offense, whatever the cause, is not a\ndefense. (iii)\n\nFactual\nimpossibility. A person who purposely engages in conduct which would constitute\nthe offense if the attendant circumstances were as that person believed them to\nbe is guilty of an attempt. For example, if A, without justification or excuse\nand with intent to kill B, points a gun at B and pulls the trigger, A is guilty\nof attempt to murder, even though, unknown to A, the gun is defective and will\nnot fire. Similarly, a person who reached into the pocket of another with the\nintent to steal that person's billfold is guilty of an attempt to commit\nlarceny, even though the pocket is empty. (iv)\n\nSolicitation. Soliciting another to\ncommit an offense does not constitute an attempt. See subdivision (f) of this\nsection for a discussion of ML, 130.78, solicitation. (v) Attempts not under ML, 130.76. While most\nattempts should be charged under article 80, the following attempts are\nspecifically addressed by some other article, and should be charged\naccordingly: (a) ML, 130.81 -\ndesertion; (b) ML, 130.90 - mutiny\nor sedition; (c) ML, 130.96 -\nsubordinate compelling; (d) ML, 130.100 - aiding the enemy. (vi)\n\nRegulations. An attempt to commit\nconduct which would violate a lawful general order or regulation under 130.88, ML (see subdivision [p] of this section) should be charged under ML, 130.76. It\nis not necessary in such cases to prove that the accused intended to violate\nthe order or regulation, but it must be proved that the accused intended to\ncommit the prohibited conduct. (4)\n\nLesser included offenses. If the accused is charged with an attempt under ML, 130.76, and the offense attempted has a lesser included offense, then the offense of\nattempting to commit the lesser included offense would ordinarily be a lesser\nincluded offense to the charge of attempt. For example, if an accused was\ncharged with attempted larceny, the offense of attempted wrongful appropriation\nwould be a lesser included offense, although it, like the attempted larceny, would be a violation of ML, 130.76. (5)\n\nSample specification. In that______ (personal jurisdiction data) did, (at/on\nboard - location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or about\n______ 19 _, attempt to (describe offense with sufficient detail to include\nexpressly or by necessary implication every element). (e) Conspiracy. [ML, 130.77]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who conspires with any\nother person or persons to commit an offense under this code shall, if one or\nmore of the conspirators does an act to effect the object of the conspiracy, be\npunished as a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that the accused entered into an\nagreement with one or more persons to commit an offense under the code; and\n(ii)\nthat, while the agreement\ncontinued to exist, and while the accused remained a party to the agreement, the accused or at least one of the co-conspirators performed an overt act for\nthe purpose of bringing about the object of the conspiracy. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Co-conspirators. Two or more persons are\nrequired in order to have a conspiracy. Knowledge of the identity of\nco-conspirators and their particular connection with the criminal purpose need\nnot be established. The accused must be subject to the code, but the other\nco-conspirators need not be. A person may be guilty of conspiracy although\nincapable of committing the intended offense. For example, a bedridden\nconspirator may knowingly furnish the car to be used in a robbery. The joining\nof another conspirator after the conspiracy has been established does not\ncreate a new conspiracy or affect the status of the other conspirators. However, the conspirator who joined an existing conspiracy can be convicted of\nthis offense only if, at or after the time of joining the conspiracy, an overt\nact in furtherance of the object of the agreement is committed. (ii)\n\nAgreement. The agreement in a conspiracy\nneed not be in any particular form or manifested in any formal words. It is\nsufficient if the minds of the parties arrive at a common understanding to\naccomplish the object of the conspiracy, and this may be shown by the conduct\nof the parties. The agreement need not state the means by which the conspiracy\nis to be accomplished or what part each conspirator is to play. (iii)\n\nObject of the agreement. The object of\nthe agreement must, at least in part, involve the commission of one or more\noffenses under the code. An agreement to commit several offenses is ordinarily\nbut a single conspiracy. Some offenses require two or more culpable actors\nacting in concert. There can be no conspiracy where the agreement exists only\nbetween the persons necessary to commit such an offense. Examples include\ndueling, bigamy, incest, adultery, and bribery. (iv)\n\nOvert act. (a) The overt act must be independent of the\nagreement to commit the offense; must take place at the time of or after the\nagreement; must be done by one or more of the conspirators, but not necessarily\nthe accused; and must be done to effectuate the object of the\nagreement. (b) The overt act need\nnot be in itself criminal, but it must be a manifestation that the agreement is\nbeing executed. Although committing the intended offense may constitute the\novert act, it is not essential that the object offense be committed. Any overt\nact is enough, no matter how preliminary or preparatory in nature, as long as\nit is a manifestation that the agreement is being executed. (c) An overt act by one conspirator becomes\nthe act of all without any new agreement specifically directed to that act and\neach conspirator is equally guilty even though each does not participate in, or\nhave knowledge of, all of the details of the execution of the\nconspiracy. (v) Liability\nfor offenses. Each conspirator is liable for all offenses committed pursuant to\nthe conspiracy by any of the co-conspirators while the conspiracy continues and\nthe person remains a party to it. (vi)\n\nWithdrawal. A party to the conspiracy\nwho abandons or withdraws from the agreement to commit the offense before the\ncommission of an overt act by any conspirator is not guilty of conspiracy. An\neffective withdrawal or abandonment must consist of affirmative conduct which\nis wholly inconsistent with adherence to the unlawful agreement and which shows\nthat the party has severed all connection with the conspiracy. A conspirator\nwho effectively abandons or withdraws from the conspiracy after the performance\nof an overt act by one of the conspirators remains guilty or conspiracy and of\nany offenses committed pursuant to the conspiracy up to the time of the\nabandonment or withdrawal. However, a person who has abandoned or withdrawn\nfrom the conspiracy is not liable for offenses committed thereafter by the\nremaining conspirators. The withdrawal of a conspirator from the conspiracy\ndoes not affect the status of the remaining members. (vii)\n\nFactual impossibility. It is not a\ndefense that the means adopted by the conspirators to achieve their object, if\napparently adapted to that end, were actually not capable of success, or that\nthe conspirators were not physically able to accomplish their intended\nobject. (viii)\n\nConspiracy as a\nseparate offense. A conspiracy to commit an offense is a separate and distinct\noffense from the offense which is the object of the conspiracy, and both the\nconspiracy and the consummated offense which was its object may be charged, tried, and punished. The commission of the intended offense may also constitute\nthe overt act which is an element of the conspiracy to commit that\noffense. (4)\n\nLesser\nincluded offense (ML, 130.76 - attempts). (5)\n\nSample specification. In that ______(personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on ______or\nabout 19_, conspire with ______(and ______) to commit an offense under the New\n\nYork Code of Military Justice, to wit: and in order to effect the object of the\nconspiracy the said ______, (and______) did ______. (f) Solicitation. [ML, 130.78]\n(1)\n\nText. \"\n(a) Any person subject to this code\nwho solicits or advises another or others to desert in violation of section\n130.81 or mutiny in violation of section 130.90 shall, if the offense solicited\nor advised is attempted or committed, be punished with the punishment provided\nfor the commission of the offense, but if the offense solicited or advised is\nnot committed or attempted, he shall be punished as a court-martial may direct. (b) Any person subject to this\ncode who solicits or advises another or others to commit an act of misbehavior\nbefore the enemy in violation of 130.95 or sedition in violation of section\n130.90 shall, if the offense solicited or advised is committed, be punished\nwith the punishment provided for the commission of the offense, but if the\noffense solicited or advised is not committed, he shall be punished as a\ncourt-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that the accused solicited or advised a\ncertain person or persons to commit any of the four offenses named in ML, 130.78; and\n(ii)\nthat the accused\ndid so with the intent that the offense actually be committed. Note: [If the offense solicited or advised was attempted or\ncommitted, add the following element.]\n(iii)\nthat the offense solicited or advised\nwas (committed) (attempted) as the proximate result of the\nsolicitation. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Instantaneous offense. The\noffense is complete when a solicitation is made or advice is given with the\nspecific wrongful intent to influence another or others to commit any of the\nfour offenses named in ML, 130.78. It is not necessary that the person or\npersons solicited or advised agree to act upon the solicitation or\nadvice. (ii)\n\nForm of solicitation. Solicitation may be by means other than word of mouth or writing. Any act or\nconduct which reasonably may be construed as a serious request or advice to\ncommit one of the four offenses named in ML, 130.78 may constitute\nsolicitation. It is not necessary that the accused act alone in the\nsolicitation or in the advising; the accused may act through other persons in\ncommitting this offense. (iii)\n\nSolicitations in violation of ML, 130.115. Solicitation to commit offenses\nother than violations of the four offense named in ML, 130.78 may be charged as\nviolations of ML, 130.115. (See paragraph 105.) However, some offenses require, as an element, of proof, some act of solicitation by the accused. These\noffenses are separate and distinct from solicitations under ML, 130.78 and ML, 130.115. When the accused's act of solicitation constitutes, by itself, a\nseparate offense, the accused should be charged with that separate, distinct\noffense in violation of ML, 130.115. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 -\nattempts). (5)\n\nSample\nspecifications. (i) For soliciting desertion\n(ML, 130.81) or mutiny (ML, 130.90). In that______(personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ______ 19 _, (a time of war) by (here state the\nmanner and ford of solicitation or advice), (solicit) ______(advise) (and\n______) to (desert in violation of ML, 130.81) (mutiny in violation of ML, 130.90). [Note: If the offense solicited or advised is attempted or committed, add the following at the end of the specification:] and, as a result of such\n(solicitation) (advice), the offense (solicited) (advised) was, on or about\n______19__, (at/on board - location), committed by ______ (and\n______). (ii)\n\nFor soliciting\nan act of misbehavior before the enemy (ML, 130.95) or sedition (ML, 130.90). In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data) did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ______19 __, (a time of war) by (here state the\nmanner and form of solicitation or advice), (solicit), (advise), ______ (and\n______) to commit (an act of misbehavior before the enemy in violation of ML, 130.95) (sedition in violation of ML, 130.90). [Note: If the offense solicited\nor advised is committed, add the following at the end of the specification:]\nand, as a result of such (solicitation) (advice), the offense (solicited)\n(advised) was, on or about ______19 __, (at/on board - location), committed by\n(and). (g) Fraudulent enlistment, appointment, or separation. [ML, 130.79]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person who- (1) procures his own enlistment or\nappointment in the organized militia by means of knowingly false\nrepresentations or deliberate concealment as to his qualifications for such\nenlistment or appointment and receives pay or allowances thereunder; or (2)\nprocures his own separation from the organized militia by knowingly false\nrepresentations or deliberate concealment as to his eligibility for that\nseparation; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Fraudulent enlistment or appointment. (a) that the accused was enlisted or\nappointed in a force of the organized militia; (b) that the accused knowingly misrepresented\nor deliberately concealed a certain material fact or facts regarding\nqualifications of the accused for enlistment or appointment; (c) that the accused's enlistment or\nappointment was obtained or procured by that knowingly false representation or\ndeliberate concealment; and\n(d) that under this enlistment or appointment the accused received pay or\nallowances or both. (ii)\n\nFraudulent separation: (a) that the accused\nwas separated from a force of the organized militia; (b) that the accused knowingly misrepresented\nor deliberately concealed a certain material fact or facts about the accused's\neligibility for separation; and\n(c) that the accused's separation was obtained or procured by that knowingly false\nrepresentation or deliberate concealment. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) In general. A fraudulent enlistment, appointment, or separation is one procured by either a knowingly false\nrepresentation as to any of the qualifications or disqualifications prescribed\nby law, regulation, or orders for the specific enlistment, appointment, or\nseparation, or deliberate concealment as to any of those disqualifications. Matters that may be material to an enlistment, appointment, or separation\ninclude any information used by the recruiting, appointing, or separating\nofficer in reaching a decision as to enlistment, appointment, or separation in\nany particular case, and any information that normally would have been so\nconsidered had it been provided to that officer. (ii)\n\nReceipt of pay or allowances. A member\nof a force of the organized militia who enlists or accepts an appointment\nwithout being regularly separated from a prior enlistment or appointment should\nbe charged under ML, 130.79 only if that member has received pay or allowances\nunder the fraudulent enlistment or appointment. Acceptance of food, clothing, shelter, or transportation from the government constitutes receipt of\nallowances. However, whatever is furnished the accused while in custody, confinement, arrest, or other restraint pending trial for fraudulent enlistment\nor appointment is not considered an allowance. The receipt of pay or allowances\nmay be proved by circumstantial evidence. (iii)\n\nOne offense. One who procures one's own\nenlistment, appointment, or separation by several misrepresentations or\nconcealments as to qualifications for the one enlistment, appointment, or\nseparation so procured, commits only one offense under ML, 130.79. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 - attempts). (5)\n\nSample\nspecifications. (i) For fraudulent enlistment\nor appointment.

(ii)\n\nFor fraudulent separation. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ______ 19__, by means of [knowingly false\nrepresentations that (here state the fact or facts material to eligibility for\nseparation which were represented), when in fact (here state the true fact or\nfacts)] [deliberate concealment of the fact that (here state the fact or facts\nconcealed which made the accused ineligible for separation)], procure\nhimself/herself to be separated from the (here state the force of the organized\nmilitia from which the accused procured his/her separation). (h) Effecting\nunlawful enlistment, appointment, or separation. [ML, 130.80]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who effects an enlistment\nor appointment in or a separation from the organized militia of any person who\nis known to him to be ineligible for that enlistment, appointment, or\nseparation because it is prohibited by law, regulation, or order shall be\npunished as a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that the accused effected the enlistment, appointment, or separation of the person named; (ii)\nthat this person was ineligible for this\nenlistment, appointment, or separation because it was prohibited by law, regulation, or order; and\n(iii)\nthat the accused knew of the ineligibility at the time of the enlistment, appointment, or separation. (3)\n\nExplanation. It must be proved that the enlistment, appointment, or\nseparation was prohibited by law, regulation, or order when effected and that\nthe accused then knew that the person enlisted, appointed, or separated was\nineligible for the enlistment, appointment, or separation. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 -\nattempts). (5)\n\nSample\nspecification.

(i) Desertion. [ML, 130.81]\n(1)\n\nText: \"\n(a) Any member of the organized\nmilitia who: (1)\nwithout proper authority\ngoes or remains absent from his place of service, organization, or place of\nduty with intent to remain away therefrom permanently; or\n(2)\nquits his unit or organization, or place\nof duty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service; or\n(3)\nwithout being regularly\nseparated from one of the forces of the organized militia enlists or accepts an\nappointment in the same or another one of the forces of the organized militia\nwithout fully disclosing the fact that he has not been so regularly\nseparated; (4)\nis guilty of\ndesertion. (b) Any\nofficer of the organized militia who, having tendered his resignation and prior\nto due notice of the acceptance of same, quits his post or proper duties\nwithout leave and with intent to remain away therefrom permanently is guilty of\ndesertion. (c) Any person found\nguilty of desertion or attempt to desert shall be punished as a court-martial\nmay direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Desertion with intent to remain\naway permanently: (a) that the accused\nabsented himself or herself from his or her place of service, organization, or\nplace of duty; (b) that such\nabsence was without authority; (c) that the accused, at the time the absence began or at some time during the\nabsence, intended to remain away from his or her unit, organization, or place\nof duty permanently; and\n(d) that\nthe accused remained absent until the date alleged. Note: [If the absence was terminated by apprehension, add the\nfollowing element.]\n(e) that\nthe accused's absence was terminated by apprehension. (ii)\n\nDesertion with intent to avoid hazardous\nduty or to shirk important service: (a) that\nthe accused quit his or her unit, organization, or other place of\nduty; (b) that the accused did so\nwith the intent to avoid a certain duty or shirk a certain service; (c) that the duty to be performed was\nhazardous or the service important; (d) that the accused knew that he or she\nwould be required for such duty or service; and\n(e) that the accused remained absent until\nthe date alleged. (iii)\n\nDesertion before notice of acceptance of resignation: (a) that the accused was a commissioned\nofficer of a force of the organized militia, and had tendered his or her\nresignation; (b) that before he or\nshe received notice of the acceptance of the resignation, the accused quit his\nor her post or proper duties; (c) that the accused did so with the intent to remain away permanently from his or\nher post or proper duties; and\n(d) that the accused remained absent until the date alleged. Note: [If the absence was terminated by apprehension, add the\nfollowing element.]\n(e) that\nthe accused's absence was terminated by apprehension. (iv)\n\nAttempted desertion. (a) that the accused did a certain overt\nact; (b) that the act was done with\nthe specific intent to desert; (c) that the act amounted to more that mere preparation; and\n(d) that the act apparently tended to effect\nthe commission of the offense of desertion. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Desertion with intent to remain away\npermanently. (a) In general. Desertion with\nintent to remain away permanently is complete when the person absents himself\nor herself without authority from his or her unit, organization, or place of\nduty, with the intent to remain away therefrom permanently. A prompt repentence\nand return, while material in extenuation, is no defense. It is not necessary\nthat the person be absent entirely from military jurisdiction and\ncontrol. (b) Absence without\nauthority-inception, duration, termination (see paragraph [j][3] of this\nsection). (c) Intent to remain away\npermanently. (1)\n\nThe intent to remain away\npermanently from the unit, organization, or place of duty may be formed any\ntime during the unauthorized absence. The intent need not exist throughout the\nabsence, or for any particular period of time, as long as it exists at some\ntime during the absence. (2)\n\nThe\naccused must have intended to remain away permanently from the unit, organization, or place of duty. When the accused had such an intent, it is not\ndefense that the accused also intended to report to elsewhere, or to enlist or\naccept an appointment in the same or a different armed force. (3)\n\nThe intent to remain away permanently may\nbe established by circumstantial evidence. Among the circumstances from which\nan inference may be drawn that an accused intended to remain absent permanently\nor that the period of absence was lengthy; that the accused attempted to, or\ndid, dispose of uniforms or other military property; that the accused purchased\na ticket for a distant point or was arrested, apprehended, or surrendered a\nconsiderable distance from the accused's station; that the accused could have\nconveniently surrendered to military control but did not; that the accused was\ndissatisfied with the accused's unit, ship, or with military service; that the\naccused made remarks indicating an intention to desert; that the accused was\nunder charges or had escaped from confinement at the time of the absence; that\nthe accused made preparations indicative of an intent not to return (for\nexample, financial arrangements); or that the accused enlisted or accepted an\nappointment in the same or another force of the organized militia without\ndisclosing the fact that the accused had not been regularly separated, or\nentered any foreign armed service without being authorized by the State. On the\nother hand, the following are included in the circumstances which may tend to\nnegate an inference that the accused intended to remain away permanently: previous long and excellent service; that the accused left valuable personal\nproperty in the unit or on the ship; or that the accused was under the\ninfluence of alcohol or drugs during the absence. These lists are illustrative\nonly. (4)\n\nEntries on documents, such as personnel accountability records, which administratively refer to an\naccused as a \"deserter\" are not evidence of intent to desert. (5)\n\nProof of, or a plea of guilty to, and\nunauthorized absence, even of extended duration, does not, without more, prove\nguilt of desertation. (d) Effect of enlistment or appointment in the same or a different force of the\norganized militia. ML, 130.81(a)(3) does not state a separate offense. Rather, it is a rule of evidence by which the prosecution may prove intent to remain\naway permanently. Proof of an enlistment or acceptance of an appointment in a\nservice without disclosing a pre-existing duty status in the same or a\ndifferent service provides the basis from which an inference of intent to\npermanently remain away from the earlier unit, organization, or place of duty\nmay be drawn. Furthermore, if a person, without being regularly separated from\none of the forces of the organized militia enlists or accepts an appointment in\nthe same or another force, the person's presence in the military service under\nsuch an enlistment or appointment is not a return to military control and does\nnot terminate any desertion or absence without authority from the earlier unit\nor organization, unless the facts of the earlier period of service are known to\nmilitary authorities. If a person, while in desertion, enlists or accepts an\nappointment in the same or another force of the organized militia, and deserts\nwhile serving that enlistment or appointment, the person may be tried and\nconvicted for each desertion. (ii)\n\nQuitting unit, organization, or place of\nduty with intent to avoid hazardous duty or to shirk important service. (a) Hazardous duty or important service. \"Hazardous duty\" or \"important service\" may include service such as duty in a\ncombat or other dangerous area; embarkation for certain foreign or sea duty; movement to a port of embarkation for that purpose; entrainment for duty on the\nborder or coast in time of war or threatened invasion or other disturbances; strike or riot duty; or employment in aid of the civil power, in, for example, protecting property, or quelling or preventing disorder in times of great\npublic disaster. Such services as drill, target practice, maneuvers, and\npractice marches are not ordinarily \"hazardous duty or important service.\"\nWhether a duty is hazardous or a service is important depends upon the\ncircumstances of the particular case, and is a question of fact for the\ncourt-martial to decide. (b) Quits\nin ML, 130.81 means \"goes absent without\nauthority.\"\n(c) Actual knowledge. ML, 130.81(a)(2) requires proof that the accused actually knew of the hazardous\nduty or important service. Actual knowledge may be proved by circumstantial\nevidence. (iii)\n\nAttempting to desert. Once the attempt is made, the fact that the person\ndeserts, voluntarily or otherwise, does not cancel the offense. The offense is\ncomplete, for example, if the person, intending to desert, hides in an empty\nfreight car on a military reservation, intending to escape by being taken away\nin the car. Entering the car with the intent to desert the overt act. For a\nmore detailed discussion of attempts, see subdivision (d) of this section. For\nan explanation concerning intent to remain away permanently, see clause\n(i)(\nc\n) of this paragraph. (iv)\n\nPrisoner with executed punitive\ndischarge. A prisoner whose dismissal or dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge\nhas been executed is not a \"member of the organized militia\" within the meaning\nof ML, 130.81 or ML, 130.82 although the prisoner may still be subject to the\ncode. (4)\n\nLesser included\noffense (ML, 130.82 - absence without leave). (5)\n\nSample specifications. (i) Desertion with intent to remain away\npermanently. In that ______(personal jurisdiction data), did, on or\nabout ______ 19 _, (a time of war) without authority and with intent to remain\naway therefrom permanently, absent himself/herself from his/her (place of\nservice) (organization) (place of duty), to wit: ______, located at (______), and did remain so absent in desertion until (he/she was apprehended) on or\nabout ______ 19 __. (ii)\n\nDesertion with intent to avoid hazardous duty or shirk important service. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, on or\nabout ______19 _, (a time of war) with intent to (avoid hazardous duty) (shirk\nimportant service), namely: ______, quit his/her (unit) (organization) (place\nof duty), to wit: ______, located at (______), and did remain so absent in\ndesertion until on or about ______19__. (iii)\n\nDesertion prior to acceptance of\nresignation. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data) having tendered\nhis/her resignation and prior to due notice of the acceptance of the same, did, on or about ______19, _, (a time of war) without leave and with intent to\nremain away therefrom permanently, quit his/her (post) (proper duties), to wit: ______, and did remain so absent in desertion until (he/she was apprehended) on\nor about ______ 19__. (iv)\n\nAttempted desertion. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did (at/on\nboard -location), on or about ______ 19 __, (a time of war) attempt to [absent\nhimself/herself from his/her (unit) (organization) (place of duty) to wit: ______, without authority and with intent to remain away therefrom permanently]\n[quit his/her (unit) (organization) (place of duty), to wit: ______, located at\n______, with intent to (avoid hazardous duty) (shirk important service) namely\n______] [______]. (j) Absence without leave. (1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who, without proper\nauthority: (1)\nfails to go to his\nappointed place of duty at the time prescribed; or\n(2)\ngoes from that place; or\n(3)\nabsents himself or remains absent from\nhis unit, organization, or place of duty at which he is required to be at the\ntime prescribed; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Failure to go to appointed place of duty: (a) that a certain authority appointed a\ncertain time and place of duty for the accused; (b) that the accused knew of that time and\nplace; and\n(c) that the accused, without authority, failed to go to the appointed place of duty at the time\nprescribed. (ii)\n\nGoing\nfrom appointed place of duty: (a) that a\ncertain authority appointed a certain time and place of duty for the\naccused; (b) that the accused knew\nof that time and place; and\n(c) that the accused, without authority, went from the appointed place of duty\nafter having reported at such place. (iii)\n\nAbsence from unit, organization, or\nplace of duty: (a) that the accused absented\nhimself or herself from his or her unit, organization, or place of duty at\nwhich he or she was required to be; (b) that the absence was without authority\nfrom anyone competent to give him or her leave; and\n(c) that the absence was for a certain period\nof time. Note: [If the absence was terminated by apprehension, add the\nfollowing element.]\n(d) that\nthe absence was terminated by apprehension. (iv)\n\nAbandoning watch or guard: (a) that the accused was a member of a guard, watch, or duty; (b) that the\naccused absented himself or herself from his or her guard, watch, or duty\nsection; (c) that the absence of\nthe accused was without authority; and\n(d) that the accused intended to abandon his\nor her guard, watch, or duty section. (v) Absence from unit, organization, or place\nof duty with intent to avoid maneuvers or field exercises: (a) that the accused absented himself or\nherself from his or her unit, organization, or place of duty at which he or she\nwas required to be; (b) that the\nabsence of the accused was without authority; (c) that the absence was for a certain period\nof time; (d) that the accused knew\nthat the absence would occur during a part of a period of maneuvers or field\nexercises; and\n(e) that the accused\nintended to avoid all or part of a period of maneuvers or field\nexercises. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) In general. This article is\ndesigned to cover every case not elsewhere provided for in which any member of\nthe organized militia is through the member's own fault not at the place where\nthe member is required to be at a prescribed time. It is not necessary that the\nperson be absent entirely from military jurisdiction and control. The first\npart of this Article-relating to the appointed place of duty-applies whether\nthe place is appointed as a rendezvous for several or for one only. (ii)\n\nActual knowledge. The offenses of\nfailure to go to and going from appointed place of duty require proof that the\naccused actually knew of the appointed time and place of duty. The offense of\nabsence from unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid\nmaneuvers or field exercises requires proof that the accused actually knew that\nthe absence would occur during a part of a period of maneuvers or field\nexercises. Actual knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence. (iii)\n\nIntent. Specific intent is not an\nelement of unauthorized absence. Specific intent is an element for certain\naggravated unauthorized absences. (iv)\n\nAggravated forms of unauthorized\nabsence. There are variations of unauthorized absence under ML, 130.82(3) which\nare more serious because of aggravating circumstances such as duration of the\nabsence, a special type of duty from which the accused absents himself or\nherself, and a particular specific intent which accompanies the absence. These\ncircumstances are not essential elements of a violation of ML, 130.82. They\nsimply constitute special matters in aggravation. The following are aggravated\nunauthorized absences: (a) Duration of the\nunauthorized absence. (b) Unauthorized absence from a guard, watch, or duty (special type of\nduty). (c) Unauthorized absence\nfrom guard, watch, or duty section with the intent to abandon it (special type\nof duty and specific intent). (d) Unauthorized absence with the intent to avoid maneuvers or field exercises\n(special type of duty and specific intent). (v) Control by civilian authorities. A member\nof the organized militia turned over to the civilian authorities upon request\nunder ML, 130.14 (see N.Y.R.C.M. 106) is not absent without leave while held by\nthem under that delivery. When a member of the organized militia, being absent\nwith leave, or absent without leave, is not thereby changed, regardless how\nlong held. The fact that a member of the organized militia is convicted by the\ncivilian authorities, or adjudicated to be a juvenile offender, or the case is\n\"diverted\" out of the regular criminal process for a probationary period does\nnot excuse any unauthorized absence, because the member's inability to return\nwas the result of willful misconduct. If a member is released by the civilian\nauthorities without trial, and was on authorized leave at the time of arrest or\ndetention, the member may be found guilty of unauthorized absence only if it is\nproved that the member actually committed the offense for which detained, thus\nestablishing that the absence was the result of the member's own\nmisconduct. (vi)\n\nInability to\nreturn. The status of absence without leave is not changed by an inability to\nreturn through sickness, lack of transportation facilities, or other\ndisabilities. But the fact that all or part of a period of unauthorized absence\nwas in a sense enforced or involuntary is a factor in extenuation and should be\ngiven due weight when considering the initial disposition of the offense. When, however, a person on authorized leave, without fault, is unable to return at\nthe expiration thereof, that person has not committed the offense of absence\nwithout leave. (vii)\n\nDetermining\nthe unit or organization of an accused. A person undergoing transfer between\nactivities is ordinarily considered to be attached to the activity to which\nordered to report. A person on temporary additional duty continues as a member\nof the regularly assigned unit and if the person is absent from the temporary\nduty assignment, the person becomes absent without leave from both units, and\nmay be charged with being absent without leave from either unit. (viii)\n\nDuration. Unauthorized absence under\nML, 130.82(3), is an instantaneous offense. It is complete at the instant an\naccused absents himself or herself without authority. Duration of the absence\nis a matter in aggravation for the purpose of increasing the maximum punishment\nauthorized for the offense. Even if the duration of the absence is not over\nthree days, it is ordinarily alleged in an ML, 130.82(3) specification. If the\nduration is not alleged or if alleged but not proved, an accused can be\nconvicted of and punished for only one day of unauthorized absence. (ix)\n\nComputation of duration. In computing\nthe duration of an unauthorized absence, any one continuous period of absence\nfound that totals not more than 24 hours is counted as one day; any such period\nthat totals more than 24 hours and not more than 48 hours is counted as two\ndays, and so on. The hours of departure and return on different dates are\nassumed to be the same if not alleged and proved. For example, if an accused is\nfound guilty of unauthorized absence from 0600 hours, 4 April, to 1000 hours, 7\n\nApril of the same year (76 hours) the maximum punishment would be based on\nabsence of four days. However, if the accused is found guilty simply of\nunauthorized absence from 4 April to 7 April, the maximum punishment would be\nbased on an absence of three days. (x) Termination-methods of return to military\ncontrol. (a) Surrender to military authority. A surrender occurs when a person presents himself or herself to any military\nauthority, whether or not a member of the same armed force, notifies that\nauthority of his or her unauthorized absence status, and submits or\ndemonstrates a willingness to submit to military control. Such a surrender\nterminates the unauthorized absence. (b) Apprehension by military authority. Apprehension by military authority of a known absentee terminates an\nunauthorized absence. (c) Delivery\nto military authority. Delivery of a known absentee terminates an unauthorized\nabsence. (d) Apprehension by\ncivilian authorities at the request of the military. When an absentee is taken\ninto custody by civilian authorities at the request of military authorities, the absence is terminated. (e) Apprehension by civilian authorities without prior military request. When an\nabsentee is in the hands of civilian authorities for other reasons and these\nauthorities make the absentee available for return to military control, the\nabsence is terminated when the military authorities are informed of the\nabsentee's availability. (xi)\n\nFindings of more than one absence under\none specification. An accused may properly be found guilty of two or more\nseparate unauthorized absences under one specification, provided that each\nabsence is included within the period alleged in the specification and provided\nthat the accused was not misled. If an accused is found guilty of two or more\nunauthorized absences under a single specification, the maximum authorized\npunishment shall not exceed that authorized if the accused had been found\nguilty as charged in the specification. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 -\nattempts). (5)\n\nSample\nspecifications. (i) Failing to go or leaving\nplace of duty. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did (at/on\nboard -location), on or about ______ 19 __, without authority, (fail to go at\nthe time prescribed to) (go from) his/her appointed place of duty, to wit: (here set forth the appointed place of duty). (ii)\n\nAbsence from unit, organization, or\nplace of duty. In that ______(personal jurisdiction data), did (at/on\nboard -location), on or about ______19 __, without authority, absent\nhimself/herself from his/her (unit) (organization) (place of duty at which\nhe/she was required to be), to wit: ______, located at ______, and did remain\nso absent until (he/she was apprehended) on or\nabout______19__. (iii)\n\nAbsence from unit, organization, or place of duty with intent to avoid\nmaneuvers or field exercises. In that ______(personal jurisdiction data), did, on or\nabout ______19 __, without authority and with intent to avoid (maneuvers)\n(field exercises), absent himself/herself from his/her (unit) (organization)\n(place of duty at which he/she was required to be), to wit: ______located at\n(______), and did remain so absent until on or about\n______19__. (iv)\n\nAbandoning\nwatch or guard. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), being a member\nof the ______ (guard) (watch) (duty section), did, (at/on board-location), on\nor about ______19 __ without authority, go from his/her (guard) (watch) (duty\nsection) with intent to abandon the same. (k) Missing movement. [ML, 130.83]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who through neglect or\ndesign misses the movement of a ship, aircraft, or unit with which he is\nrequired in the course of duty to move shall be punished as a court-martial may\ndirect.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that the accused was required in the\ncourse of duty to move with a ship, aircraft or unit; (ii)\nthat the accused knew of the prospective\nmovement of the ship, aircraft or unit; (iii)\nthat the accused missed the movement of\nthe ship, aircraft or unit; and\n(iv)\nthat the accused missed the movement\nthrough design or neglect. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Movement. \"Movement\" as used in ML, 130.83 includes a move, transfer, or shift of a ship, aircraft, or unit\ninvolving a substantial distance and period of time. Whether a particular\nmovement is substantial is a question to be determined by the court-martial\nconsidering all the circumstances. Changes which do not constitute a \"movement\"\ninclude practice marches of a short duration with a return to the point of\ndeparture, and minor changes in location of ships, aircraft, or units, as when\na ship is shifted from one berth to another in the same shipyard or harbor or\nwhen a unit is moved from one barracks to another on the same post. (ii)\n\nMode of movement. (a) Unit. If a person is required in the\ncourse of duty to move with a unit, the mode of travel is not important, whether it be military or commercial, and includes travel by ship, train, aircraft, truck, bus, or walking. The word \"unit\" is not limited to any\nspecific technical category such as those listed in a table of organization and\nequipment, but also includes units which are created before the movement with\nthe intention that they have organizational continuity upon arrival at their\ndestination regardless of their technical designation, and units intended to be\ndisbanded upon arrival at their destination. (b) Ship, aircraft. If a person is assigned\nas a crew member or is ordered to move as a passenger aboard a particular ship\nor aircraft, military or chartered, then missing the particular sailing or\nflight is essential to establish the offense of missing movement. (iii)\n\nDesign\nmeans on purpose, intentionally, or according to plan and requires specific\nintent to miss the movement. (iv)\n\nNeglect\nmeans the omission to take such measures as are\nappropriate under the circumstances to assure presence with a ship, aircraft, or unit at the time of a scheduled movement, or doing some act without giving\nattention to its probable consequences in connection with the prospective\nmovement, such as a departure from the vicinity of the prospective movement to\nsuch a distance as would make it likely that one could not return in time for\nthe movement. (v) Actual knowledge. In order to be guilty of the offense, the accused must have actually known of\nthe prospective movement that was missed. Knowledge of the exact hour or even\nof the exact date of the scheduled movement is not required. It is sufficient\nif the approximate date was known by the accused as long as there is a casual\nconnection between the conduct of the accused and the missing of the scheduled\nmovement. Knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence. (vi)\n\nProof of absence. That the accused\nactually missed the movement may be proved by documentary evidence, as by a\nproper entry in a log or a morning report. This fact may also be proved by the\ntestimony of personnel of the ship, aircraft, or unit (or by other evidence)\nthat the movement occurred at a certain time, together with evidence that the\naccused was physically elsewhere at that time. (4)\n\nLesser included offenses. (i) Design. (a) ML, 130.83 - missing movement through\nneglect; (b) ML, 130.82 - absence\nwithout authority; (c) ML, 130.76 -\nattempts. (ii)\n\nNeglect. ML, 130.82 - absence without authority. (5)\n\nSample specification. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ______ 19 __, through (neglect) (design) miss\nthe movement of (Aircraft No. ______) (Flight ______) (the USS______) (Company\nA, 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry) (______) with which he/she was required in the\ncourse of duty to move. (l) Contempt toward officials. [ML, 130.84]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who uses contemptuous\nwords against the President, Vice-President, Congress, Secretary of Defense, Secretary of a Military Department, Secretary of Transportation, the Governor\nor the Legislature shall be punished as a court-martial may\ndirect.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that the accused was a person subject to\nthe code; (ii)\nthat the accused\nused certain words against an official or legislature named in the\narticle; (iii)\nthat by an act of\nthe accused these words came to the knowledge of a person other than the\naccused; and\n(iv)\nthat the words\nused were contemptuous, whether in themselves or by virtue of the circumstances\nunder which they were used. (3)\n\nExplanation. The official or Legislature against whom the words are used\nmust be occupying one of the offices or be one of the legislatures named in ML, 130.84, at the time of the offense. \"Legislature\" does not include its members\nindividually. \"Governor\" does not include \"Lieutenant Governor.\" It is\nimmaterial whether the words are used against the official in an official or\nprivate capacity. If not personally contemptuous, adverse criticism of one of\nthe officials or legislatures named in the article in the course of a political\ndiscussion, even though emphatically expressed, may not be charged as a\nviolation or the article. Similarly, expressions of opinion made in a purely\nprivate conversation should not ordinarily be charged. Giving broad circulation\nto a written publication containing contemptuous words of the kind made\npunishable by this Article, or the utterance of contemptuous words of this kind\nin the presence of military subordinates, aggravates the offense. The truth or\nfalsity of the statements is immaterial. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 -\nattempts). (5)\n\nSample\nspecification. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ______ 19 __, [use (orally and publicly)\n(______) the following words] against the [(President)] [(Governor)\n(Legislature) of the State of New York)], to wit \" ______\", or words to that\neffect. (m) Disrespect towards superior officer. [ML, 130.85]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who behaves with\ndisrespect toward his superior officer shall be punished as a court-martial may\ndirect.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that the accused did or omitted certain\nacts or used certain language to or concerning a certain officer; (ii)\nthat such behavior or language was\ndirected toward that officer; (iii)\nthat the officer toward whom the acts, omissions, or words were directed was\nthe superior officer of the accused; (iv)\nthat the accused then knew that the\nofficer toward whom the acts, omissions, or words were directed was the\naccused's superior officer; and\n(v) that, under the circumstances, the behavior or language was disrespectful to\nthat officer. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Superior officer (see ML, 130.1[3]). (a) Accused and victim in same\nforce of the organized militia. If the accused and the victim are in the same\nforce of the organized militia, the victim is a \"superior officer\" of the\naccused when either superior in rank or command to the accused; however, the\nvictim is not a \"superior officer\" or the accused if the victim is inferior in\ncommand, even though superior in rank. (b) Accused and victim in different forces of\nthe organized militia. If the accused and the victim are in different forces of\nthe organized militia, the victim is a \"superior officer\" of the accused when\nthe victim is an officer and superior in the chain of command over the accused\nor when the victim, not a medical officer or a chaplain, is senior in grade to\nthe accused and both are detained by a hostile entity so that recourse to the\nnormal chain of command is prevented. The victim is not a \"superior officer\"\nthe accused merely because the victim is superior in grade to the\naccused. (c) Execution of office. It is not necessary that the \"superior officer\" be in the execution of office\nat the time of the disrespectful behavior. (ii)\n\nKnowledge. If the accused did not know\nthat the person against whom the acts or words were directed was the accused's\nsuperior officer, the accused may not be convicted of a violation of this\n\nArticle. Knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence. (iii)\n\nDisrespect. Disrespectful behavior is\nthat which detracts from the respect due the authority and person of a superior\nofficer. It may consist of acts or language, however expressed, and it is\nimmaterial whether they refer to the superior as an officer or as a private\nindividual. Disrespect by words may be conveyed by abusive epithets or other\ncontemptuous or denunciatory language. Truth is no defense. Disrespect by acts\nincludes neglecting the customary salute, or showing a marked disdain, indifference, insolence, impertinence, undue familiarity, or other rudeness in\nthe presence of the superior officer. (iv)\n\nPresence. It is not essential that the\ndisrespectful behavior be in the presence of the superior, but ordinarily one\nshould not be held accountable under this Article for what was said or done in\na purely private conversation. (v) Special defense-unprotected victim. A superior officer whose conduct in\nrelation to the accused under all the circumstances; departs substantially from\nthe required standards appropriate to that officer's rank or position under\nsimilar circumstances loses the protection of this Article. That accused may\nnot be convicted of being disrespectful to the officer who has so lost the\nentitlement to respect protected by ML, 130.85. (4)\n\nLesser included offenses. (i) ML, 130.111 - provoking speeches or\ngestures; (ii)\nML, 130.76 -\nattempts. (5)\n\nSample\nspecification. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard -location), on or about ______ 19 __, behave himself/herself with\ndisrespect toward ______, his/her superior officer, then known by the said\n______ to be his/her superior officer by (saying to him/her \"______,\" or words\nto that effect) (contemptuously turning from and leaving him/her while he/she, the said ______, was talking to him/her, the said ______)\n(______). (n) Assaulting or willfully disobeying officer. [ML, 130.86]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who- (1) strikes his\nsuperior officer or draws or lifts up any weapon or offers any violence against\nhim while he is in the execution of his office; or (2) willfully disobeys a\nlawful command of his superior officer; shall be punished as a court-martial\nmay direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Striking or assaulting superior officer. (a) that the accused struck, drew, or lifted\nup a weapon against, or offered violence against, a certain officer; (b) that the officer was the superior officer\nof the accused; (c) that the\naccused then knew that the officer was the accused's superior officer; and\n(d) that the superior officer\nwas then in the execution of office. (ii)\n\nDisobeying superior officer: (a) that the accused received a lawful\ncommand from a certain officer; (b) that this officer was the superior officer of the accused; (c) that the accused then knew that this\nofficer was the accused's superior officer; and\n(d) that the accused willfully disobeyed the\nlawful command. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Striking or assaulting superior officer. (a) Definitions. (1)\n\nSuperior officer. The\ndefinitions in clauses (m)(3)(1) (\na\n) and (\nb\n)\nof this section apply here and in subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph. (2)\n\nStrikes\nmeans an intentional blow, and includes any offensive\ntouching of the person of an officer, however slight. (3)\n\nThe phrase\ndraws or lifts up any\nweapon against\ncovers any simple assault committed in the manner\nstated. The drawing of any weapon in an aggressive manner or the raising or\nbrandishing of the same in a threatening manner in the presence of and at the\nsuperior is the sort of act prescribed. The raising in a threatening manner of\na firearm, whether or not loaded, of a club, or of anything by which a serious\nblow or injury could be given is included in \"lifts up.\"\n(4)\n\nThe phrase\noffers any violence\nagainst\nincludes any form of battery or of mere assault not embraced\nin the preceding more specific terms \"strikes\" and \"draws or lifts up.\" If not\nexecuted, the violence must be physically attempted or menaced. A mere\nthreatening in words is not an offering of violence in the sense of this\n\nArticle. (b) Execution of\noffice. An officer is in the execution of office when engaged in any act or\nservice required or authorized by treaty, statute, regulation, the order of a\nsuperior, or military usage. In general, any striking or use of violence\nagainst any superior officer by a person over whom it is the duty of that\nofficer to maintain discipline at the time, would be striking or using violence\nagainst the officer in the execution of office. The commanding officer on board\na ship or the commanding officer of a unit in the field is generally considered\nto be on duty at all times. (c) Knowledge. If the accused did not know the officer was the accused's superior\nofficer, the accused may not be convicted of this offense. Knowledge may be\nproved by circumstantial evidence. (d) Defenses. In a prosecution for striking\nor assaulting a superior officer in violation of this Article, it is a defense\nthat the accused acted in the proper discharge of some duty, or that the victim\nbehaved in a manner toward the accused such as to lose the protection of this\n\nArticle (see subparagraph [m][3][v] of this section). For example, if the\nvictim initiated an unlawful attack on the accused, this would deprive the\nvictim of the protection of this Article. (ii)\n\nDisobeying superior officer. (a) Lawfulness of the order. (1)\n\nInference of lawfulness. An order\nrequiring the performance of a military duty or act may be inferred to be\nlawful and it is disobeyed at the peril of the subordinate. This inference does\nnot apply to a patently illegal order, such as one that directs the commission\nof a crime. (2)\n\nAuthority of\nissuing officer. The officer issuing the order must have authority to give such\nan order. Authorization may be based on law, regulation, or custom of the\nservice. (3)\n\nRelationship to\nmilitary duty. The order must relate to military duty, which includes all\nactivities reasonably necessary to accomplish a military mission, or safeguard\nor promote the morale, discipline and usefulness of members of a command and\ndirectly connected with the maintenance of good order in the service. The order\nmay not, without such valid military purpose, interfere with private rights or\npersonal affairs. However, the dictates of a person's conscience, religion, or\npersonal philosophy cannot justify or excuse the disobedience of an otherwise\nlawful order. Disobedience of an order which has for its sole object the\nattainment of some private end, or which is given for the sole purpose of\nincreasing the penalty for an offense which it is expected the accused may\ncommit, is not punishable under this Article. (4)\n\nRelationship to statutory or\nconstitutional rights. The order must not conflict with the statutory or\nconstitutional rights of the person receiving the order. (b) Personal nature of the order. The order\nmust be directed specifically to the subordinate. Violations of regulations, standing orders or directives, or failure to perform previously established\nduties are not punishable under this Article, but may violate ML, 130.88. (c) Form and transmission\nof the order. As long as the order is understandable, the form of the order is\nimmaterial, as is the method by which it is transmitted to the\naccused. (d) Specificity of the\norder. The order must be a specific mandate to do or not to do a specific act. An exhortation to \"obey the law\" or to perform one's military duty does not\nconstitute an order under this Article. (e) Knowledge. The accused must have actual\nknowledge of the order and of the fact that the person issuing the order was\nthe accused's superior officer. Actual knowledge may be proved by\ncircumstantial evidence. (f) Nature\nof the disobedience. \"Willfull disobedience\" is an intentional defiance of\nauthority. Failure to comply through heedlessness, remissness, or forgetfulness\nis not a violation of this Article but may violate ML, 130.88. (g) Time for compliance. When an order\nrequires immediate compliance, an accused's declared intent not to obey and the\nfailure to make any move to comply constitutes disobedience. If an order does\nnot indicate the time within which it is to be complied with, either expressly\nor by implication, then a reasonable delay in compliance does not violate this\n\nArticle. If an order requires performance in the future, an accused's present\nstatement of intention to disobey the order does not constitute disobedience of\nthat order, although carrying out that intention may. (4)\n\nLesser included offenses. (i) Striking superior officer in execution of\noffice: (a) ML, 130.86 - drawing or lifting up\na weapon or offering violence to superior officer in execution of\noffice: (b) ML, 130.76 -\nattempts. (ii)\n\nDrawing or\nlifting up a weapon or offering violence to superior officer in execution of\noffice: (a) ML, 130.76 - attempts. (iii)\n\nWillfully disobeying lawful\norder of superior officer. (a) ML, 130.88 -\nfailure to obey lawful order; (b) ML, 130.85 - disrespect to superior commissioned officer; (c) ML, 130.76 - attempts. (5)\n\nSample\nspecifications. (i) Striking superior\nofficer.

(iii)\n\nOffering\nviolence to superior commissioned officer. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard -location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or about\n______ 19 __, (a time of war) offer violence against ______, his/her superior\nofficer, then known by the said ______to be his/her superior officer, who was\nthen in the execution of his/her office, by ______. (iv)\n\nWillful disobedience of superior\nofficer.

(o) Insubordinate conduct toward\nnoncommissioned officer. [ML, 130.87]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any warrant officer or enlisted person who- (1) strikes or\nassaults a warrant officer, noncommissioned officer, or petty officer, while\nsuch officer is in the execution of his office; or (2) willfully disobeys the\nlawful order of a warrant officer, noncommissioned officer, or petty officer; or (3) treats with contempt or is disrespectful in language or deportment\ntoward a warrant officer, noncommissioned officer, or petty officer while such\nofficer is in the execution of his office; shall be punished as a court-martial\nmay direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Striking or assaulting warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer: (a) that\nthe accused was a warrant officer or enlisted member; (b) that the accused struck or assaulted a\ncertain warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer; (c) that the striking or assault was\ncommitted while the victim was in the execution of office; and\n(d) that the accused then knew that the\nperson struck or assaulted was a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer. Note: [If the victim was the superior noncommissioned or petty\nofficer of the accused, add the following elements.]\n(e) that the victim was the superior\nnoncommissioned, or petty officer of the accused; and\n(f) that the accused then knew that the\nperson struck or assaulted was the accused's superior noncommissioned, or petty\nofficer. (ii)\n\nDisobeying\na warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer: (a) that the accused was a warrant officer or\nenlisted member; (b) that the\naccused received a certain lawful order from a certain warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer; (c) that the accused then knew that the\nperson giving the order was a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty\nofficer; (d) that the accused had a\nduty to obey the order; and\n(e) that the accused willfully disobeyed the order. (iii)\n\nTreating with contempt or being\ndisrespectful in language or deportment toward a warrant, noncommissioned, or\npetty officer: (a) that the accused was a\nwarrant officer or enlisted member; (b) that the accused did or omitted certain\nacts, or used certain language; (c) that such behavior or language was used toward and within sight or hearing of a\ncertain warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer; (d) that the accused then knew that the\nperson toward whom the behavior or language was directed was a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer; (e) that the victim was then in the execution\nof office; and\n(f) that under the\ncircumstances the accused, by such behavior or language, treated with contempt\nor was disrespectful to said warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer. Note: [If the victim was the superior noncommissioned, or petty\nofficer of the accused, add the following elements.]\n(g) that the victim was the superior\nnoncommissioned, or petty officer of the accused; and\n(h) that the accused then knew that the\nperson toward whom the behavior or language was directed was the accused's\nsuperior noncommissioned, or petty officer. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) In general. ML, 130.87 has the same\ngeneral objects with respect to warrant, noncommissioned, and petty officers as\nML, 130.85 and ML, 130.86 have with respect to officers, namely, to ensure\nobedience to their lawful orders, and to protect them from violence, insult, or\ndisrespect. Unlike ML, 130.85 and ML, 130.86, however, this Article does not\nrequire a superior-subordinate relationship as an element of any of the\noffenses denounced. This article does not protect an acting noncommissioned\nofficer or acting petty officer, nor does it protect military police or members\nof the shore patrol who are not warrant, noncommissioned, or petty\nofficers. (ii)\n\nKnowledge. All of\nthe offenses prohibited by ML, 130.87 require that the accused have actual\nknowledge that the victim was a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer. Actual knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence. (iii)\n\nStriking or assaulting a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer. For a discussion of \"strikes\" and \"in the\nexecution of office,\" see paragraph (n)(3) of this section. Discussion of\n\"assault\" follows. (iv)\n\nDisobeying\na warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer. See subparagraph (n)(3)(ii) of\nthis section for a discussion of lawfulness, personal nature, form, transmission, and specificity of the order, nature of the disobedience, and\ntime for compliance with the order. (v) Treating with contempt or being\ndisrespectful in language or deportment toward a warrant, noncommissioned, or\npetty officer. \"Towards\" requires that the behavior and language be within the\nsight or hearing of the warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer concerned. For a discussion of \"in the execution of his office,\" see paragraph (n)(3) of\nthis section. For a discussion of disrespect, see paragraph (m)(3) of this\nsection. (4)\n\nLesser\nincluded offenses. (i) Striking or assaulting\nwarrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer (ML, 130.76 - attempts). (ii)\n\nDisobeying a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer: (a) ML, 130.88 - failure to\nobey a lawful order; (b) ML, 130.76\n- attempts.

(p) Failure to obey order or\nregulation. [ML, 130.88]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who: (1)\nviolates or fails to obey any lawful\ngeneral order or regulation; (2)\nhaving knowledge of any other lawful order issued by a member of the Armed\n\nForces, which it is his duty to obey, fails to obey the order; or\n(3)\nis derelict in the performance of his\nduties; shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Violation of or failure to obey a lawful\ngeneral order or regulation: (a) that there\nwas in effect a certain lawful general order or regulation. (b) that the accused had a duty to obey it; and\n(c) that the accused violated\nor failed to obey the order or regulation. (ii)\n\nFailure to obey other lawful order: (a) that a member of the Armed Forces issued\na certain lawful order; (b) that\nthe accused had knowledge of the order; (c) that the accused had a duty to obey the\norder; and\n(d) that the accused\nfailed to obey the order. (iii)\n\nDereliction in the performance of\nduties: (a) that the accused had certain\nduties; (b) that the accused had\nknowledge of the duties; and\n(c) that the accused was (willfully) (through neglect or culpable inefficiency)\nderelict in the performance of those duties. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Violation of or failure to obey a lawful\ngeneral order or regulation. (a) Authority to\nissue general orders and regulations. General orders or regulations are those\norders or regulations generally applicable to an armed force which are properly\npublished by the Governor, the Chief of Staff to the Governor, and those orders\nor regulations generally applicable to the command of the officer issuing them\nthroughout the command or a particular subdivision thereof which are issued by: (1)\nan officer having general court-martial\njurisdiction; (2)\na general or flag\nofficer in command; or\n(3)\na\ncommander superior to subclause (\n1\n) or (\n2\n) of\nthis clause. (b) Effect\nof change of command on validity of order. A general order or regulation issued\nby a commander with authority under ML, 130.88(i) retains its character as a\ngeneral order or regulation when another officer takes command, until it\nexpires by its own terms or is rescinded by separate action, even if it is\nissued by an officer who is a general or flag officer in command and command is\nassumed by another officer who is not a general or flag officer. (c) Lawfulness. A general order or regulation\nis lawful unless it is contrary to the Constitutions, the laws of the United\n\nStates or New York, or lawful superior orders or for some other reason is\nbeyond the authority of the official issuing it. See the discussion of\nlawfulness in clause (n)(3)(ii)(\na\n) of this section. (d) Knowledge. Knowledge of a general order\nor regulation need not be alleged or proved, as knowledge is not an element of\nthis offense and a lack of knowledge does not constitute a defense. (e) Enforceability. Not all provisions in\ngeneral orders or regulations can be enforced under ML, 130.88(1). Regulations\nwhich only supply general guidelines or advice for conducting military\nfunctions may not be enforceable under ML, 130.88(1). (ii)\n\nViolation of or failure to obey other\nlawful order. (a) Scope. ML, 130.88(2)\nincludes all other lawful orders which may be issued by a member of the\norganized militia, violations of which are not chargeable under ML, 130.86, 130.87, or 130.88(1). It includes the violation of written regulations which\nare not general regulations. See also clause (i)(\ne\n) of this\nparagraph as applicable. (b) Knowledge. In order to be guilty of this offense, a person must have had actual\nknowledge of the order or regulation. Knowledge of the order may be proved by\ncircumstantial evidence. (c) Duty\nto obey order. (1)\n\nFrom a superior. A member\nof one force of the organized militia who is senior in rank to a member of\nanother force of the organized militia is the superior of that member with\nauthority to issue orders which that member has a duty to obey under the same\ncircumstances as an officer of one force of the organized militia is the\nsuperior officer of a member of another force of the organized militia for the\npurposes of ML, 130.85 and ML, 130.86. See subparagraph (m)(3)(i) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nFrom one not a\nsuperior. Failure to obey the lawful order of one not a superior is an offense\nunder ML, 130.88(2), provided the accused has a duty to obey the order, such as\none issued by a sentinel. See subparagraph (o)(2)(ii) of this section if the\norder was issued by a warrant, noncommissioned, or petty officer in the\nexecution of office. (iii)\n\nDereliction in the performance of\nduties. (a) Duty. A duty may be imposed by\ntreaty, statute, regulation, lawful order, standard operating procedure, or\ncustom of the service. (b) Knowledge. In order to be guilty of this offense, a person must have had actual\nknowledge of the duties. Knowledge of the duties may be proved by\ncircumstantial evidence. (c) Derelict. A person is derelict in the performance of duties when that person\nwillfully or negligently fails to perform that person's duties or when that\nperson performs them in a culpably inefficient manner. Willfully\nmeans intentionally. It refers to the doing of an\nact knowingly and purposely, specifically intending the natural and probable\nconsequences of the act. Negligently\nmeans an act or omission\nof a person who is under a duty to use due care which exhibits a lack of that\ndegree of care which a reasonably prudent person would have exercised under the\nsame or similar circumstances. \"Culpable inefficiency\" is inefficiency for\nwhich there is no reasonable or just excuse. (d) Ineptitude. A person is not derelict in\nthe performance of duties if the failure to perform those duties is caused by\nineptitude rather than by willfulness, negligence, or culpable inefficiency, and may not be charged under this Article, or otherwise punished. For example, a recruit who has tried earnestly during rifle training and throughout record\nfiring is not derelict in the performance of duties if the recruit fails to\nqualify with the weapon. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 -\nattempts). (5)\n\nSample\nspecifications. (i) Violation or failure to\nobey lawful general order or regulation. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or about\n______ 19 __, (violate) (fail to obey) a lawful general (order) (regulation), to wit: [specifically identify the order] [______], by (wrongfully)\n______. (ii)\n\nViolation or\nfailure to obey other lawful written order. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), having\nknowledge of a lawful order issued by ______, to wit: [specifically identify\nthe order], an order which it was his/her duty to obey, did, (at/on board -\nlocation) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or about ______\n19 __, fail to obey the same by (wrongfully) ______. (iii)\n\nFailure to obey other lawful order. In that ______, (personal jurisdiction data) having\nknowledge of a lawful order issued by ______ (to submit to certain medical\ntreatment) (to ______) (not to ______) ( ______), an order which it was his/her\nduty to obey, did (at/on board - location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or about ______ 19 __, fail to obey the same [by (wrongfully)\n______.]\n(iv)\n\nDereliction in\nthe performance of duties. In that ______, (personal jurisdiction data), (at/on board\n-location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), (on or about ______\n19__) (from about ______ 19__ to about______19 __), having knowledge of his/her\nduties, was derelict in the performance of those duties in that he/she\n(negligently) (willfully) (by culpable inefficiency) failed to ______, as it\nwas his/her duty to do. (q) Cruelty and maltreatment. (1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who is guilty of cruelty\ntoward, or oppression or maltreatment of, any person subject to his order shall\nbe punished as a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that a certain person was subject to the\norders of the accused; and\n(ii)\nthat the accused was cruel toward, or oppressed, or maltreated that\nperson. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Nature of victim. \"Any person subject to\nhis orders\" means not only those persons under the direct or immediate command\nof the accused but extends to all persons, subject to the code or not, who by\nreason of some duty are required to obey the lawful orders of the accused, regardless whether the accused is in the direct chain of command over the\nperson. (ii)\n\nNature of act. The\ncruelty, oppression, or maltreatment, although not necessarily physical, must\nbe measured by an objective standard. Assault, improper punishment, and sexual\nharassment may constitute this offense. Sexual harassment includes influencing, offering to influence, or threatening the career, pay, or job of another person\nin exchange for sexual favors, and deliberate or repeated offensive comments or\ngestures of a sexual nature. The imposition of necessary or proper duties and\nthe exaction of their performance does not constitute this offense even though\nthe duties are arduous or hazardous or both. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 -\nattempts). (5)\n\nSample\nspecification.

(r) Mutiny or sedition. [ML, 130.90]\n(1)\n\nText. \"\n(a) Any person subject to this code: (1)\nwho with intent to usurp or override\nlawful military authority, refuses, in concert with any other person or\npersons, to obey orders or otherwise do his duty or creates any violence or\ndisturbance is guilty of mutiny; (2)\nwho with intent to cause the overthrow or\ndestruction of lawful civil authority, creates, in concert with any other\nperson or persons, revolt, violence, or other disturbance against such\nauthority is guilty of sedition; (3)\nwho fails to do his utmost to prevent and\nsuppress an offense of mutiny or sedition being committed in his presence, or\nfails to take all reasonable means to inform his superior or commanding officer\nof an offense of mutiny or sedition which he knows or has reason to believe is\ntaking place, is guilty of a failure to suppress or report a mutiny or\nsedition. (b) A person\nwho is found guilty of attempted mutiny, sedition, or failure to suppress or\nreport a mutiny or sedition shall be punished as a court-martial may\ndirect.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Mutiny by creating violence or\ndisturbance: (a) that the accused created\nviolence or a disturbance; and\n(b) that the accused created this violence or disturbance with intent to usurp or\noverride lawful military authority. (ii)\n\nMutiny by refusing to obey orders or to\nperform duty: (a) that the accused refused to\nobey orders or otherwise do the accused's duty; (b) that the accused in refusing to obey\norders or perform duty acted in concert with another person or persons; and\n(c) that the accused did so\nwith intent to usurp or override lawful military authority. (iii)\n\nSedition: (a) that the accused created revolt, violence, or disturbance against lawful civil authority; (b) that the accused acted in concert with\nanother person or persons; and\n(c) that the accused did so with the intent to cause the overthrow or destruction\nof that authority. (iv)\n\nFailure to prevent and suppress a mutiny or sedition: (a) that an offense of mutiny or sedition was\ncommitted in the presence of the accused; and\n(b) that the accused failed to do the\naccused's utmost to prevent and suppress the mutiny or sedition. (v) Failure to report mutiny or\nsedition: (a) that an offense of mutiny or\nsedition occurred; (b) that the\naccused knew or had reason to believe that the offense was taking place; and\n(c) that the accused failed to\ntake all reasonable means to inform the accused's superior commissioned officer\nor commander of the offense. (vi)\n\nAttempted mutiny: (a) that the accused committed a certain\novert act; (b) that the act was\ndone with specific intent to commit the offense of mutiny; (c) that the act amounted to more than mere\npreparation; and\n(d) that the act\napparently tended to effect the commission of the offense of mutiny. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Mutiny. ML, 130.90(a)(1) defines two\ntypes of mutiny, both requiring an intent to usurp or override military\nauthority. (a) Mutiny by creating violence or\ndisturbance. Mutiny by creating violence or disturbance may be committed by one\nperson acting alone or by more than one acting together. (b) Mutiny by refusing to obey orders or\nperform duties. Mutiny by refusing to obey orders or perform duties requires\ncollective insubordination and necessarily includes some combination of two or\nmore persons in resisting lawful military authority. This concert of\ninsubordination need not be preconceived, nor is it necessary that the\ninsubordination be active or violent. It may consist simply of a persistent and\nconcerted refusal or omission to obey orders, or to do duty, with an\ninsubordinate intent, that is, with an intent to usurp or override lawful\nmilitary authority. The intent may be declared in words or inferred from acts, omissions, or surrounding circumstances. (ii)\n\nSedition. Sedition requires a concert of\naction in resistance to civil authority. This differs from mutiny by creating\nviolence or disturbance. See clause (i)(\na\n) of this\nparagraph. (iii)\n\nFailure to prevent\nand suppress a mutiny or sedition. Utmost\nmeans taking those\nmeasures to prevent and suppress a mutiny or sedition which may properly be\ncalled for by the circumstances, including the rank, responsibilities, or\nemployment of the person concerned. \"Utmost\" includes the use of such force, including deadly force, as may be reasonably necessary under the circumstances\nto prevent and suppress a mutiny or sedition. (iv)\n\nFailure to report a mutiny or sedition. Failure to \"take all reasonable means to inform\" includes failure to take the\nmost expeditious means available. When the circumstances known to the accused\nwould have caused a reasonable person in similar circumstances to believe that\na mutiny or sedition was occurring, this may establish that the accused had\nsuch \"reason to believe\" that mutiny or sedition was occurring. Failure to\nreport an impending mutiny or sedition is not an offense in violation of ML, 130.90. But see subparagraph (p)(3)(iii) of this section (dereliction of\nduty). (v) Attempted mutiny. For a\ndiscussion of attempts, see subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. (4)\n\nLesser included offenses. (i) Mutiny by creating violence or\ndisturbance: (a) ML, 130.86 - assault on\ncommissioned officer; (b) ML, 130.87 - insubordinate conduct toward noncommissioned officer; (c) ML, 130.90 - attempted mutiny; (d) ML, 130.110 - riot; breach of\npeace; (e) ML, 130.115 - disorderly\nconduct. (ii)\n\nMutiny by\nrefusing to obey orders or perform duties: (a) ML, 130.86 - willful disobedience of officer; (b) ML, 130.87 - insubordinate conduct toward\nnoncommissioned officer; (c) ML, 130.88 - failure to obey lawful order; (d) ML, 130.90 - attempted mutiny. (iii)\n\nSedition: (a) ML, 130.110 - riot; breach of\npeace; (b) ML, 130.115 - disorderly\nconduct; (c) ML, 130.76 -\nattempts. (5)\n\nSample specifications.

(s) Arrest and confinement. [ML, 130.91]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who resists apprehension\nor breaks arrest or who escapes from custody or confinement shall be punished\nas a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Resisting apprehension: (a) that a certain person attempted to\napprehend the accused; (b) that\nsaid person was authorized to apprehend the accused; and\n(c) that the accused actively resisted the\napprehension. (ii)\n\nBreaking arrest: (a) that a certain person\nordered the accused into arrest; (b) that said person was authorized to order\nthe accused into arrest; and\n(c) that the accused when beyond the limits of arrest before being released from\nthat arrest by proper authority. (iii)\n\nEscape from custody: (a) that a certain person apprehended the\naccused; (b) that said person was\nauthorized to apprehend the accused; and\n(c) that the accused freed himself or herself\nfrom custody before being released by proper authority. (iv)\n\nEscape from confinement: (a) that a certain person ordered the accused\ninto confinement; (b) that said\nperson was authorized to order the accused into confinement; and\n(c) that the accused freed himself or herself\nfrom confinement before being released by proper authority. (3)\n\nExplanation\n(i) Resisting apprehension: (a) Apprehension. Apprehension is the taking\nof a person into custody. See N.Y.R.C.M. 302. (b) Authority to apprehend. See N.Y.R.C.M. 302(b) concerning who may apprehend. Whether the statutes of a person\nauthorized that person to apprehend the accused is a question of law to be\ndecided by the military judge. Whether the person who attempted to make an\napprehension had such a status is a question of fact to be decided by the\nfactfinder. (c) Nature of the\nresistance. The resistance must be active, such as assaulting the person\nattempting to apprehend or flight. Mere words of opposition, argument, or\nabuse, and attempts to escape from custody after the apprehension is complete, do not constitute the offense of resisting apprehension although they may\nconstitute other offenses. (d) Mistake. It is a defense that the accused held a reasonable belief that the\nperson attempting to apprehend did not have authority to do so. However, the\naccused's belief at the time that no basis exists for the apprehension is not a\ndefense. (e) Illegal apprehension. A person may not be convicted of resisting apprehension if the attempted\napprehension is illegal, but may be convicted of other offenses, depending on\nall the circumstances. An attempted apprehension by a person authorized to\napprehend is presumed to be legal in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Ordinarily the legality of an apprehension is a question of law to be decided\nby the military judge. (ii)\n\nBreaking arrest. (a) Arrest. There are two types of arrest: pretrial arrest under ML, 130.9 (see N.Y.R.C.M. 304) and arrest under ML, 130.15 (see paragraph 5c[3], Part V). This article prohibits breaking any\narrest. (b) Authority to order\narrest. See N.Y.R.C.M. 304(b) and paragraphs 2 and 5b, Part V concerning\nauthority to order arrest. (c) Nature of restraint imposed by arrest. In arrest, the rerestraint is moral\nrestraint imposed by orders fixing the limits of arrest. (d) Breaking. Breaking arrest is committed\nwhen the person in arrest infringes the limits set by orders. The reason for\nthe infringement is immaterial. For example, innocence of the offense with\nrespect to which an arrest may have been imposed is not a defense. (e) Illegal arrest. A person may not be\nconvicted of breaking arrest if the arrest is illegal. An arrest ordered by one\nauthorized to do so is presumed to be legal in the absence of some evidence to\nthe contrary. Ordinarily, the legality of an arrest is a question of law to be\ndecided by the military judge. (iii)\n\nEscape from custody. (a) Custody. Custody\nis\nrestraint of free locomotion imposed by lawful apprehension. The restraint may\nbe physical or, once there has been a submission to apprehension or a forcible\ntaking into custody, it may consist of control exercised in the presence of the\nprisoner by official acts or orders. Custody is temporary restraint intended to\ncontinue until other restraint (arrest, restriction, confinement) is imposed or\nthe person is released. (b) Authority to apprehend (see clause [i][b] of this paragraph). (c) Escape. For a discussion of escape, see\nclause (iv)(\nc\n) of this paragraph. (d) Illegal custody. A person may not be\nconvicted of this offense if the custody was illegal. An apprehension effected\nby one authorized to apprehend is presumed to be lawful in the absence of\nevidence to the contrary. Ordinarily, the legality of an apprehension is a\nquestion of law to be decided by the military judge. (e) Correctional custody, see subdivision\n(as) of this section. (iv)\n\nEscape from confinement. (a) Confinement. Confinement is physical\nrestraint imposed under N.Y.R.C.M. 305; 1101; or paragraph 5b, Part\nV. (b) Authority to order\nconfinement. See N.Y.R.C.M. 304(b); 1101; and paragraphs 2 and 5b, Part V\nconcerning who may order confinement. (c) Escape. An escape may be either with or\nwithout force or artifice, and either with or without the consent of the\ncustodian. However, where a prisoner is released by one with apparent authority\nto do so, the prisoner may not be convicted of escape from confinement (see\nalso clause [t][3][i] [\nb\n] of this section). Any completed\ncasting off of the restraint of confinement, before release by proper\nauthority, is an escape, and lack of effectiveness of the restraint imposed is\nimmaterial. An escape is not complete until the prisoner is momentarily free\nfrom the restraint. If the movement toward escape is opposed, of before it is\ncompleted, an immediate pursuit follows, there is not escape until opposition\nis overcome or pursuit is shaken off. (d) Status when temporarily outside\nconfinement facility. A prisoner who is temporarily escorted outside a\nconfinement facility for a work detail or other reason by a guard, who has both\nthe duty and means to prevent that prisoner from escaping, remains in\nconfinement. (e) Legality of\nconfinement. A person may not be convicted of escape from confinement if the\nconfinement is illegal. Confinement ordered by one authorized to do so is\npresumed to be lawful in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Ordinarily, the legality of confinement is a question of law to be decided by the military\njudge. (4)\n\nLesser included offenses. (i) Breaking arrest. ML, 130.76 - attempts. (ii)\n\nEscape\nfrom custody. ML, 130.76 - attempts. (iii)\n\nEscape from confinement. ML, 130.76 -\nattempts. (5)\n\nSample\nspecifications. (i) Resisting apprehension. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard -location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or about\n______ 19__, resist being apprehended by ______, a person authorized to\napprehend the accused. (ii)\n\nBreaking arrest. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), having been\nplaced in arrest (in quarters) (in his/her company area) (______) by a person\nauthorized to order the accused into arrest, did, (at/on board -location) on or\nabout ______ 19 __, break said arrest. (iii)\n\nEscape from custody. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or about\n______ 19__, escape from the custody of ______, a person authorized to\napprehend the accused. (iv)\n\nEscape from confinement. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), having been\nplaced in confinement in (place of confinement), by a person authorized to\norder the accused into confinement did, (at/on board - location)\n(subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or about ______19__, escape\nfrom confinement. (t) Releasing prisoner without proper\nauthority. [ML, 130.92]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who, without proper\nauthority, releases any prisoner committed to his charge, or who through\nneglect or design suffers any such prisoner to escape, shall be punished as a\ncourt-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Releasing a prisoner without proper\nauthority: (a) that a certain prisoner was\ncommitted to the charge of the accused; and\n(b) that the accused released the prisoner\nwithout proper authority. (ii)\n\nSuffering a prisoner to escape through\nneglect: (a) that a certain prisoner was\ncommitted to the charge of the accused; (b) that the prisoner escaped; (c) that the accused did not take such care\nto prevent the escape as a reasonably careful person, acting in the capacity in\nwhich the accused was acting, would have taken in the same or similar\ncircumstances; and\n(d) that the\nescape was the proximate result of the accused's neglect. (iii)\n\nSuffering a prisoner to escape through\ndesign: (a) that a certain prisoner was\ncommitted to the charge of the accused; (b) that the design of the accused was to\nsuffer the escape of that prisoner; and\n(c) that the prisoner escaped as a result of\nthe carrying out of the design of the accused. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Releasing a prisoner without proper\nauthority. (a) Prisoner. Prisoner\nincludes a civilian or military person who has been\nconfined. (b) Release. The release\nof a prisoner is removal of restraint by the custodian rather than by the\nprisoner. (c) Authority to release. See N.Y.R.C.M. 305(g) as to who may release pretrial prisoners. Normally, the\nlowest authority competent to order release of a postrial prisoner is the\ncommander who convened the court-martial which sentenced the prisoner or the\nofficer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the prisoner (see\nalso N.Y.R.C.M. 1101). (d) Committed. Once a prisoner has been confined, the prisoner has been \"committed\"\nin the sense of ML, 130.92 and only a competent authority (see clause\n[\nc\n] of this subparagraph) may order release, regardless of\nfailure to follow procedures prescribed by the code, this Chapter, or other\nlaw. (ii)\n\nSuffering a\nprisoner to escape through neglect. (a) Suffer. Suffer\nmeans to allow or permit; not to forbid or\nhinder. (b) Neglect. Neglect\nis a relative term. It is the absence of conduct which\nwould have been taken by a reasonably careful person in the same or similar\ncircumstances. (c) Escape. Escape\nis defined in clause (s)(3)(iv)(\nc\n) of this section. (d) Status of prisoner after escape not a\ndefense. After escape, the fact that a prisoner returns, is captured, killed, or otherwise dies is not a defense. (iii)\n\nSuffering a prisoner to escape through\ndesign. An escape is suffered through design when it is intended. Such intent\nmay be inferred from conduct so wantonly devoid of care that the only\nreasonable inference which may be drawn is that the escape was contemplated as\na probable result. (4)\n\nLesser included offenses. (i) Releasing a\nprisoner without proper authority (ML, 130.76 -attempts). (ii)\n\nSuffering a prisoner to escape through\nneglect. None. (iii)\n\nSuffering a\nprisoner to escape through design. (a) ML, 130.92 - suffering a prisoner to escape through neglect; (b) ML, 130.76 - attempts. (5)\n\nSample\nspecifications. (i) Releasing a prisoner\nwithout proper authority. In that ____ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ____ 19 __, without proper authority, release\n____, a prisoner committed to his/her charge. (ii)\n\nSuffering a prisoner to escape through\nneglect or design. In that ____ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ____ 19 __, through (neglect) (design), suffer\n____, a prisoner committed to his/her charge, to escape. (u) Unlawful\ndetention. [ML, 130.93]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who, except as provided by\nlaw or regulations, apprehends, arrests, or confines any person shall be\npunished as a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that the accused apprehended, arrested, or confined a certain person; and\n(ii)\nthat the accused unlawfully exercised\nthe accused's authority to do so. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Scope. This article prohibits improper\nacts by those empowered by the code to arrest, apprehend, or confine. See ML, 130.7 and 130.9; N.Y.R.C.M. 302, 304, 305, and 1101, and paragraphs 2 and 5b, Part V. It does not apply to private acts of false imprisonment or unlawful\nrestraint of another's freedom of movement by one not acting under such a\ndelegation of authority under the code. (ii)\n\nNo force required. The apprehension, arrest, or confinement must be against the will of the person restrained, but\nforce is not required. (iii)\n\nDefense. A reasonable belief held by the person imposing restraint that it is\nlawful is a defense. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 - attempts). (5)\n\nSample specification. In that ____ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ____ 19 __, unlawfully (apprehend ____) (place\n____ in arrest) (confine ____ in ____). (v) Noncompliance with procedural\nrules. [ML, 130.94]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who-\n(1)\nis responsible for unnecessary delay in\nthe disposition of any case of a person accused of an offense under this code; or\n(2)\nknowingly and intentionally\nfails to enforce or comply with any provision of this code regulating the\nproceedings before, during, or after trial of an accused; shall be punished as\na court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Unnecessary delay in disposing\nof case: (a) that the accused was charged\nwith a certain duty in connection with the disposition of a case of a person\naccused of an offense under the code; (b) that the accused knew that the accused\nwas charged with this duty; (c) that delay occurred in the disposition of the case; (d) that the accused was responsible for the\ndelay; and\n(e) that, under the\ncircumstances, the delay was unnecessary. (ii)\n\nKnowingly and intentionally failing to\nenforce or comply with the provisions of the code; (a) that the accused failed to enforce or\ncomply with a certain provision of the code regulating a proceeding before, during, or after a trial; (b) that\nthe accused had the duty of enforcing or complying with that provision of the\ncode; (c) that the accused knew\nthat the accused was charged with this duty; and\n(d) that the accused's failure to enforce or\ncomply with that provision was intentional. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Unnecessary delay in disposing of case. The purpose of section (1) of ML, 130.94 is to ensure expeditious disposition\nof cases of persons accused of offenses under the code. A person may be\nresponsible for delay in the disposition of a case only when that person's\nduties require action with respect to the disposition of that case. (ii)\n\nKnowingly and intentionally failing to\nenforce or comply with provisions of the code. Section (2) of ML, 130.94 does\nnot apply to errors made in good faith before, during, or after trial. It is\ndesigned to punish intentional failure to enforce or comply with the provisions\nof the code regulating the proceedings before, during, and after trial. Unlawful command influence under ML, 130.37 may be prosecuted under this\n\nArticle. See also ML, 130.31 and N.Y.R.C.M. 104. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 -\nattempts).

(ix)\n\nFailing to afford relief and assistance: (a) that certain troops, combatants, vessels, or aircraft of the Armed Forces belonging to the United States or an ally of\nthe United States or any other state or the organized militia were engaged in\nbattle and required relief and assistance; (b) that the accused was in a position and\nable to render relief and assistance to these troops, combatants, vessels, or\naircraft, without jeopardy to the accused's mission; (c) that the accused failed to afford all\npracticable relief and assistance; and\n(d) that, at the time, the accused was before\nor in the presence of the enemy. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) (a) Running away\nmeans an unauthorized departure to avoid actual\nor impending combat. It need not, however, be the result of fear, and there is\nno requirement that the accused literally run. (b) Enemy. Enemy\nincludes\norganized forces of the enemy in time of war, any hostile body that our forces\nmay be opposing, such as a rebellious mob or a band of renegades, and includes\ncivilians as well as members of military organizations. \"Enemy\" is not\nrestricted to the enemy government or its armed forces. All the citizens of one\nbelligerent are enemies of the government or its armed forces. All the citizens\nof one belligerent are enemies of the government and all the citizens of the\nother. (c) Before the enemy. Whether a person is \"before the enemy\" is a question of tactical relation, not\ndistance. For example, a member of an antiaircraft gun crew charged with\nopposing anticipated attack from the air, or a member of a unit about to move\ninto combat may be before the enemy although miles from the enemy lines. On the\nother hand, an organization some distance from the front or immediate area of\ncombat which is not a part of tactical operation then going on or in immediate\nprospect is not \"before or in the presence of the enemy\", within the meaning of\nthis Article. (ii)\n\nShamefully abandoning, surrendering, or delivering up of command. (a) Scope. This provision concerns primarily\ncommanders chargeable with responsibility for defending a command, unit, place, ship or military property. Abandonment by a subordinate would ordinarily be\ncharged as running away. (b) Shameful. Surrender or abandonment without justification is shameful within the\nmeaning of this Article. (c) Surrender; delivers up. \"Surrenders\" and \"delivers up\" are synonymous for the\npurposes of this Article. (d) Justification. Surrender or abandonment of a command, unit, place, ship, or\nmilitary property by a person charged with its defense can be justified only by\nthe utmost necessity or extremity. (iii)\n\nEndangering safety of a command, unit, place, ship, or military property. (a) Neglect. Neglect\nis the absence of conduct which would have\nbeen taken by a reasonably careful person in the same or similar\ncircumstances. (b) Intentional\nmisconduct. \"Intentional misconduct\" does not include a mere error in\njudgment. (iv)\n\nCasting\naway arms or ammunition. Self-explanatory. (v) Cowardly conduct. (a) Cowardice. Cowardice\nis\nmisbehavior motivated by fear. (b) Fear. Fear is a natural feeling of apprehension when going into battle. The\nmere display of apprehension does not constitute this offense. (c) Nature of offense. Refusal or abandonment\nof a performance of duty before or in the presence of the enemy as a result of\nfear constitutes this offense. (d) Defense. Genuine and extreme illness, not generated by cowardice, is a\ndefense. (vi)\n\nQuitting\nplace of duty to plunder or pillage. (a) Place\nof duty. Place of duty\nincludes any place of duty, whether\npermanent or temporary, fixed or mobile. (b) Plunder or pillage. Plunder or\npillage\nmeans to seize or appropriate public or private property\nunlawfully. (c) Nature of offense. The essence of this offense is quitting the place of duty with intent to\nplunder or pillage. Merely quitting with that purpose is sufficient, even if\nthe intended misconduct is not done. (vii)\n\nCausing false alarms. This provision\ncovers spreading of false or disturbing rumors or reports, as well as the false\ngiving of established alarm signals. (viii)\n\nWillfully failing to do utmost to\nencounter enemy. Willfully refusing a lawful order to go on a combat patrol may\nviolate this provision. (ix)\n\nFailing to afford relief and assistance. (a) All practicable relief and assistance\nmeans all relief and\nassistance which should be afforded within the limitations imposed upon a\nperson by reason of that person's own specific tasks or mission. (b) Nature of offense. This offense is\nlimited to a failure to afford relief and assistance to forces \"engaged in\nbattle.\"\n(4)\n\nLesser included offenses.

(t) Subordinate\ncompelling surrender. [ML, 130.96]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who compels or attempts to\ncompel a commander of any place, vessel, aircraft, or other military property, or of any body of members of the armed forces of the United States or of any\nother state, or of the organized militia to give it up to an enemy or to\nabandon it, or who strikes the colors or flag to an enemy without proper\nauthority, shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Compelling surrender: (a) that a certain person was in command of a\ncertain place, vessel, aircraft, or other military property or of a body of\nmembers of the Armed Forces of the United States or of and other state or of\nthe organized militia. (b) that the\naccused did an overt act which was intended to and did compel that commander to\ngive it up to the enemy or abandon it; and\n(c) that the place, vessel, aircraft, or\nother military property or body of members of the Armed Forces of the United\n\nStates or of any other state or of the organized militia was actually given up\nto the enemy or abandoned. (ii)\n\nAttempting to compel surrender: (a) that a certain person was in command of a\ncertain place, vessel, aircraft, or other military property or of a body of\nmembers of the Armed Forces of the United States or of any other state or of\nthe organized militia; (b) that the\naccused did a certain overt act; (c) that the act was done with the intent to\ncompel that commander to give up to the enemy or abandon the place, vessel, aircraft, or other military property or body of members of the Armed Forces of\nthe United States or of any other state, or of the organized militia; (d) that the act amounted to more than mere\npreparation; and\n(e) that the act\napparently intended to bring about the compelling of surrender or\nabandonment. (iii)\n\nStriking the colors or flag: (a) that there\nwas an offer of surrender to an enemy; (b) that this offer was made by striking the\ncolors or flag to the enemy or in some other manner; (c) that the accused made or was responsible\nfor the offer; and\n(d) that the\naccused did not have proper authority to make the offer. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Compelling surrender. (a) Nature of offense. The offenses under\nthis Article are similar to mutiny or attempted mutiny designed to bring about\nsurrender or abandonment. Unlike some cases of mutiny, however, concert of\naction is not an essential element of the offenses under this Article. The\noffense is not complete until the place, military property, or command is\nactually abandoned or given up to the enemy. (b) Surrender. \"Surrender\" and \"to give it up\nto an enemy\" are synonymous. (c) Acts required. The surrender or abandonment must be compelled or attempted to\nbe compelled by acts rather than words. (ii)\n\nAttempting to compel surrender. The\noffense of attempting to compel a surrender or abandonment does not require\nactual abandonment or surrender, but there must be some act done with this\npurpose in view, even if it does not accomplish the purpose. (iii)\n\nStriking the colors or flag. (a) In general. To\nstrike the colors\nor flag\nis to haul down the colors or flag in the face of the enemy or\nto make any other offer of surrender. It is traditional wording for an act of\nsurrender. (b) Nature of offense. The offense is committed when one assumes the authority to surrender a military\nforce or position when not authorized to do so either by competent authority or\nby the necessities of battle. If continued battle has become fruitless and it\nis impossible to communicate with higher authority, those facts will constitute\nproper authority to surrender. The offense may be committed whenever there is\nsufficient contact with the enemy to give the opportunity of making an offer of\nsurrender and it is not necessary that an engagement with the enemy be in\nprogress. It is unnecessary to prove that the offer was received by the enemy\nor that it was rejected or accepted. The sending of an emissary charged with\nmaking the offer of surrender is an act sufficient to prove the offer, even\nthough the emissary does not reach the enemy. (iv)\n\nEnemy. For a discussion of \"enemy\", see\nclause (w)(3)(i)(\nb\n) of this section. (4)\n\nLesser included offense. Striking the colors or flag (ML, 130.76 -\nattempts). (5)\n\nSample\nspecifications.

In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ______ 19 __, (attempt to) compel ______, the\ncommander of ______, (to give up to the enemy) (to abandon) said ______, by\n______. (ii)\n\nStriking the\ncolors or flag. In that ____ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ____ 19 __, without proper authority, offer to\nsurrender to the enemy by [striking the (colors) (flag)] [ ____\n]. (y) Improper use of countersign. [ML, 130.97]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who in time of war\ndiscloses the parole or countersign to any person not entitled to receive it, or who gives to another who is entitled to receive and use the parole or\ncountersign a different parole or countersign from that which, to his\nknowledge, he was authorized and required to give, shall be punished as a\ncourt-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Disclosing the parole or countersign to\none not entitled to receive it: (a) that, in\ntime of war, the accused disclosed the parole or countersign to a person, identified or unidentified; and\n(b) that this person was not entitled to receive it. (ii)\n\nGiving a parole or countersign different\nfrom that authorized: (a) that, in time of\nwar, the accused knew that the accused was authorized and required to give a\ncertain parole or countersign; and\n(b) that the accused gave to a person\nentitled to receive and use this parole or countersign a different parole or\ncountersign from that which the accused was authorized and required to\ngive. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Countersign. A\ncountersign\nis a word, signal, or procedure given from the\nprincipal headquarters of a command to aid guards and sentinel in their\nscrutinyof persons who apply to pass the lines. It consists of a secret\nchallenge and a password, signal or procedure. (ii)\n\nParole. A\nparole\nis a\nword used as a check on the countersign; it is given only to those who are\nentitled to inspect guards and to commanders of guards. (iii)\n\nWho may receive countersign. The class\nof persons entitled to receive the counter sign or parole will expand and\ncontract under the varying circumstances of war. Who these persons are will be\ndetermined largely, in any particular case, by the general or special orders\nunder which the accused was acting. Before disclosing such a word, a person\nsubject to military law must determine at that person's peril that the\nrecipient is a person authorized to receive it. (iv)\n\nIntent, motive, negligence, mistake, ignorance not defense. The accused's intent or motive in disclosing the\ncountersign or parole is immaterial to the issue of guilt, as is the fact that\nthe disclosure was negligent or inadvertent. It is no defense that the accused\ndid not know that the person to whom the countersign or parole was given was\nnot entitled to receive it. (v) How\naccused received countersign or parole. It is immaterial whether the accused\nhad received the countersign or parole in the regular course of duty or whether\nit was obtained in some other way. (vi)\n\nIn time of war. This phrase means a\nperiod of war declared by Congress of the factual determination by the\n\nPresident that the existence of hostilities warrants a finding that a \"time of\nwar\" exists. (4)\n\nLesser\nincluded offense (130.76, ML - attempts). (5)\n\nSample specifications. (i) Disclosing the parole or countersign to\none not entitled to receive it. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ______ 19 __, a time of war, disclose the\n(parole) (countersign), to wit: ______, to ______, a person who was not\nentitled to receive it. (ii)\n\nGiving a parole or countersign different from that authorized. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ______ 19 __, a time of war, give to ______, a\nperson entitled to receive and use the (parole) (countersign), a (parole)\n(countersign), namely: ______ which was different from that which, to his/her\nknowledge, he/she was authorized and required to give, to wit: ______. (z) Forcing a safeguard. [ML, 130.98]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who forces a safeguard\nshall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that a safeguard had been issued or\nposted for the protection of a certain person or persons, place, or\nproperty; (ii)\nthat the accused\nknew or should have known of the safeguard; and\n(iii)\nthat the accused forced the\nsafeguard. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) A\nsafeguard\nis a detachment, guard, or detail posted by a commander for the protection of\npersons, places, or property of the enemy, or of a neutral affected by the\nrelationship of belligerent forces in their prosecution of war or during\ncircumstances amounting to a state of belligerency. The term also includes a\nwritten order left by a commander with an enemy subject or posted upon enemy\nproperty for the protection of that person or property. A safeguard is not a\ndevice adopted by a belligerent to protect its own property or nationals or to\nensure order within its own forces, even if those forces are in a theater of\ncombat operations, and the posting of guards or of off-limits signs does not\nestablish a safeguard unless a commander takes those actions to protect enemy\nor neutral persons or property. The effect of a safeguard is to pledge the\nhonor of the nation that the person or property shall be respected by the\nnational armed forces. (ii)\n\nForcing\na safeguard. Forcing a safeguard\nmeans to perform an act or\nacts in violation of the protection of the safeguard. (iii)\n\nNature of offense. Any trespass on the\nprotection of the safeguard will constitute an offense under this Article, whether the safeguard was imposed in time of war or in circumstances amounting\nto a state of belligerency short of a formal state of war. (iv)\n\nKnowledge. Actual knowledge of the\nsafeguard is not required. It is sufficient if an accused should have known of\nthe existence of the safeguard. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 -\nattempts). (5)\n\nSample\nspecification.

(3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Failing to secure public property taken\nfrom the enemy. (a) Nature of property. Unlike\nthe remaining offenses under this Article, failing to secure public property\ntaken from the enemy involves only public property. Immediately upon its\ncapture from the enemy, public property becomes the property of the United\n\nStates. Neither the person who takes it nor any other person has any private\nright in this property. (b) Nature\nof duty. Every person subject to the code has an immediate duty to take such\nsteps as are reasonably within that person's power to secure public property\nfor the service of the United States and to protect it from destruction or\nloss. (ii)\n\nFailing to\nreport and turn over captured or abandoned property. (a) Reports.

No response or receipt by the\nenemy is required. The offense is complete the moment the communication, correspondence, or intercourse issues from the accused. The communication, correspondence, or intercourse may be conveyed directly or indirectly. A\nprisoner of war may violate this Article by engaging in unauthorized\ncommunications with the enemy. See also subparagraph (ac)(3)(iii) of this\nsection. (b) Knowledge. Actual\nknowledge is required but may be proved by circumstantial evidence. (4)\n\nLesser included\noffense.

(ac)\n\nMisconduct as a prisoner. [ML, 130.101]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who, while in the hands of\nthe enemy in time of war- (1) for the purpose of securing favorable treatment\nby his captors acts without proper authority in a manner contrary to law, custom, or regulation, to the detriment of others of whatever nationality held\nby the enemy as civilian or military prisoners; or (2) while in a position of\nauthority over such persons maltreats them without justifiable cause; shall be\npunished as a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Acting without authority to the detriment\nof another for the purpose of securing favorable treatment: (a) that without proper authority the accused\nacted in a manner contrary to law, custom, or regulation; (b) that the act was committed while the\naccused was in the hands of the enemy in time of war; (c) that the act was done for the purpose of\nsecuring favorable treatment of the accused by the captors; and\n(d) that other prisoners held by the enemy, either military or civilian, suffered some detriment because of the accused's\nact. (ii)\n\nMaltreating\nprisoners while in a position of authority: (a) that the accused maltreated a prisoner\nheld by the enemy; (b) that the act\noccurred while the accused was in the hands of the enemy in time of\nwar; (c) that the accused held a\nposition of authority over the person maltreated; and\n(d) that the act was without justifiable\ncause. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Enemy. For a discussion of\n\"enemy\", see clause (w)(3)(i)(\nb\n) of this section. (ii)\n\nIn time of war. See subparagraph\n(y)(3)(vi) of this section. (iii)\n\nActing without authority to the detriment of another for the purpose of\nsecuring favorable treatment. (a) Nature of\noffense. Unauthorized conduct by a prisoner of war must be intended to result\nin improvement by the enemy of the accused's condition and must operate to the\ndetriment of other prisoners either by way of closer confinement, reduced\nrations, physical punishment, or other harm. Examples of this conduct include\nreporting plans of escape being prepared by others or reporting secret food\ncaches, equipment, or arms. The conduct of the prisoner must be contrary to\nlaw, custom, or regulation. (b) Escape. Escape from the enemy is authorized by custom. An escape or escape\nattempt which results in closer confinement or other measures against fellow\nprisoners still in the hands of the enemy is not an offense under this\n\nArticle. (iv)\n\nMaltreating\nprisoners while in a position of authority. (a) Authority. The source of authority is not\nmaterial. It may arise from the military rank of the accused or - despite\nservice regulations or customs to the contrary - designation by the captor\nauthorities, or voluntary election or selection by other prisoners for their\nself-government. (b) Maltreatment. The maltreatment must be real, although not necessarily physical, and it must\nbe without justifiable cause. Abuse of an inferior by inflammatory and\nderogatory words may, through mental anguish, constitute this\noffense. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 - attempts). (5)\n\nSample specifications. (i) Acting without authority to the detriment\nof another for the purpose of securing favorable treatment. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), while in the\nhands of the enemy, did, (at/on board - location) on or about ______ 19 __, a\ntime of war, without proper authority and for the purpose of securing favorable\ntreatment by his/her captors, (report to the commander of Camp ______ the\npreparations by ______, a prisoner at said camp, to escape, as a result of\nwhich report the said ______ was placed in solitary confinement)\n(______). (ii)\n\nMaltreating\nprisoner while in a position of authority. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ______ 19 __, a time of war, while in the hands\nof the enemy and in a position of authority over ______, a prisoner at ______, as (officer in charge of prisoners at ______) (______), maltreat the said\n______ by (depriving him/her of ______) (______), without justifiable\ncause. (ad)\n\nFalse official statements. [ML, 130.102]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who with intent to\ndeceive, signs any false record, return, regulation, order, or other official\ndocument, knowing the same to be false, or makes any other false official\nstatement knowing the same to be false, shall be punished as a court-martial\nmay direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that the accused signed a certain\nofficial document or made a certain official statement; (ii)\nthat the document or statement was false\nin certain particulars; (iii)\nthat\nthe accused knew it to be false at the time of signing it or making it; and\n(iv)\nthat the false document or\nstatement was made with the intent to deceive. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Official documents and statements. Official documents and official statements include all documents and statements\nmade in the line of duty. (ii)\n\nStatus of victim of the deception. The rank of any person intended to be\ndeceived is immaterial if that person was authorized in the execution of a\nparticular duty to require or receive the statement or document from the\naccused. The government may be the victim of this offense. (iii)\n\nIntent to deceive. The false\nrepresentation must be made with the intent to deceive. It is not necessary\nthat the false statement be material to the issue under inquiry. If, however, the falsity is in respect to a material matter, it may be considered as some\nevidence of the intent to deceive, while immateriality may tend to show an\nabsence of this intent. (iv)\n\nMaterial gain. The expectation of material gain is not an element of this\noffense. Such expectation or lack of it, however, is circumstantial evidence\nbearing on the element of intent to deceive. (v) Knowledge that the document or statement\nwas false. The false representation must be one which the accused actually knew\nwas false. Actual knowledge may be proved by circumstantial evidence. An\nhonest, although erroneous, belief that a statement made is true, is a\ndefense. (vi)\n\nStatements made\nduring an interrogation. (a) Person without an\nindependent duty or obligation to speak. A statement made by an accused or\nsuspect during an interrogation is not an official statement within the meaning\nof the article if that person did not have an independent duty or obligation to\nspeak. (But see paragraph 79 [false swearing].)\n(b) Person with an independent duty or\nobligation to speak. If a suspect or accused does have an independent duty or\nobligation to speak, as in the case of a custodian who is required to account\nfor property, a statement made by that person during an interrogation into the\nmatter is official. While the person could remain silent (ML, 130.31 [b]), if\nthe person chooses to speak, the person must do so truthfully. (4)\n\nLesser included\noffense (ML, 130.76 - attempts). (5)\n\nSample specification. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or about\n______ 19 __, with intent to deceive, [sign an official (record) (return)\n(______), to wit: ______ ] [make to ______, an official statement, to wit: ______], which (record) (return) (statement) ( ______), was (totally false)\n(false in that ______), and was then known by the said ______ to be so\nfalse. (ae)\n\nMilitary property - loss, damage, destruction, or wrongful disposition. [ML, 130.103]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who, without proper\nauthority- (1) sells or otherwise disposes of; or (2) willfully or through\nneglect damages, destroys, or loses; or (3) willfully or through neglect\nsuffers to be lost, damaged, destroyed, sold, or wrongfully disposed of; any\nmilitary property of the United States or of the state shall be punished as a\ncourt-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Selling or otherwise disposing of\nmilitary property: (a) that the accused sold\nor otherwise disposed of certain property (which was a firearm or\nexplosive); (b) that the sale or\ndisposition was without proper authority; (c) that the property was military property\nof the United States or of the state; and\n(d) that the property was of a certain\nvalue. (ii)\n\nDamaging, destroying, or losing military property: (a) that the accused, without proper authority, damaged or destroyed certain\nproperty in a certain way, or lost certain property; (b) that the property was military property\nof the United States or of the state; (c) that the damage, destruction, or loss was\nwillfully caused by the accused or was the result of neglect by the accused; and\n(d) that the property was of a\ncertain value or the damage was of a certain amount. (iii)\n\nSuffering military property to be lost, damaged, destroyed, sold, or wrongfully disposed of: (a) that certain property (which was a\nfirearm or explosive) was lost, damaged, destroyed, sold, or wrongfully\ndisposed of; (b) that the property\nwas military property of the United States or of the state; (c) that the loss, damage, destruction, sale, or wrongful disposition was suffered by the accused, without proper authority, through a certain omission of duty by the accused; (d) that this omission was willful or\nnegligent; and\n(e) that the\nproperty was of a certain value or the damage was of a certain\namount. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Military property. Military\nproperty is all property, real or personal, owned, held, or used by one of the\nmilitary departments of the United States or of the state. It is immaterial\nwhether the property sold, disposed of, destroyed, lost, or damaged had been\nissued to the accused, to someone else, or even issued at all. If it is proved\nby either direct or circumstantial evidence that items of individual issue were\nissued to the accused, it may be inferred, depending on all the evidence, that\nthe damage, destruction, or loss proved was due to the neglect of the accused. Retail merchandise of service exchange stores is not military property under\nthis section. (ii)\n\nSuffering\nmilitary property to be lost, damaged, destroyed, sold, or wrongfully disposed\nof. To\nsuffer\nmeans to allow or permit. The willful or\nnegligent sufference specified by this Article includes: deliberate violation\nor intentional disregard of some specific law, regulation, or order; reckless\nor unwarranted personal use of the property; causing or allowing it to remain\nexposed to the weather, insecurely housed, or not guarded; permitting it to be\nconsumed, wasted, or injured by other persons; or loaning it to a person, known\nto be irresponsible, by whom it is damaged. (iii)\n\nValue and damage. In the case of loss, destruction, sale, or wrongful disposition, the value of the property controls\nthe maximum punishment which may be adjudged. In the case of damage, the amount\nof damage controls. As a general rule, the amount of damage is the estimated or\nactual cost of repair by the government agency normally employed in such work, or the cost of replacement, as shown by government price lists or otherwise, whichever is less.

(af)\n\nProperty other than military\nproperty-waste, spoil, or destruction. (1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who, while on active state\nduty or in a duty status other than active state duty, willfully or recklessly\nwastes, spoils, or otherwise willfully and wrongfully destroys or damages any\nproperty other than military property of the United States or of the state\nshall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) Wasting or spoiling of nonmilitary\nproperty: (a) that the accused was on active\nstate duty or in a duty status other than active state duty at the time of the\noffense; (b) that the accused\nwillfully or recklessly wasted or spoiled certain real property in a certain\nmanner; (c) that the property was\nthat of another person; and\n(d) that the property was of a certain value. (ii)\n\nDestroying or damaging nonmilitary\nproperty: (a) that the accused was on active\nstate duty or in a duty status other than active state duty at the time of the\noffense; (b) that the accused\nwillfully and wrongfully destroyed or damaged certain personal property in a\ncertain manner; (c) that the\nproperty was that of another person; and\n(d) that the property was of a certain value\nor the damage was of a certain amount. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Active state duty or in a duty status\nother than active state duty. The code was enacted in 1953, after several years\nstudy of prior military law. Such prior law had provided court-martial\njurisdiction over many offenses primarily civil in nature. Because of the\ndisparity in sentencing authority between what civilian criminal courts and\ncourts- martial could adjudge. The 1953 codification deleted many of these\ncivilian-cognizable offenses. One group of exceptions is that contained in ML, 130.104. Although this offense is primarily civil in nature and cognizable in\ncivilian criminal courts in the interests of military discipline, it was felt\nnecessary that courts-martial retain jurisdiction over this group of offenses. Hence, the duty status of the accused was specifically made an element of each\noffense. (ii)\n\nWasting or spoiling\nnonmilitary property. This portion of ML, 130.104 prescribes willful or\nreckless waste or spoilation of the real property of another. The terms\nwastes\nand\nspoils\nas used in this Article\nrefer to such wrongful acts of voluntary destruction of or permanent damage to\nreal property as burning down buildings, burning piers, tearing down fences, or\ncutting down trees. This destruction is punishable whether done willfully, that\nis intentionally, or recklessly, that is through a culpable disregard of the\nforeseeable consequences of some voluntary act. (iii)\n\nDestroying or damaging nonmilitary\nproperty. This portion of ML, 130.104 prescribes the willful and wrongful\ndestruction or damage of the personal property of another. To be destroyed, the\nproperty need not be completely demolished or annihilated, but must be\nsufficiently injured to be useless for its intended purpose. Damage consists of\nany physical injury to the property. To constitute an offense under this\nsection, the destruction or damage of the property must have been willful and\nwrongful. As used in this section\nwillfully\nmeans\nintentionally and\nwrongfully\nmeans contrary to law, regulation, lawful order, or custom. Willfulness may be proved by\ncircumstantial evidence, such as the manner in which the acts were\ndone. (iv)\n\nValue and damage. In the\ncase of destruction, the value of the property destroyed controls the maximum\npunishment which may be adjudged. In the case of damage, the amount of the\ndamage controls. As a general rule, the amount of damage is the estimated or\nactual cost of repair by artisans employed in this work who are available to\nthe community wherein the owner resides, or the replacement cost, whichever is\nless. (Paragraph 46c[1][g]). (4)\n\nLesser included offense. (ML, 130.76 -\nattempts)\n(5)\n\nSample specification. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), [(while on\nactive state duty) (while in a duty status other than active state duty)], did, (at/on board - location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or\nabout ______19 __, [(willfully) (recklessly) waste] [(willfully) (recklessly)\nspoil] $______]willfully and wrongfully (destroy) (damage) by______,] [of a\nvalue of (about) $ ______] [the amount of said damage being in the sum of\n(about) $______], the property of ______. (ag)\n\nImproper hazarding of\nvessel. (1)\n\nText. \"\n(a) Any person subject to this code who willfully and\nwrongfully hazards or suffers to be hazarded any vessel of the United States or\nthe organized militia shall be punished as a court-material may\ndirect. (b) Any person subject to\nthis code who negligently hazards or suffers to be hazarded any vessel of the\n\nUnited States or of the organized militia shall be punished as a court-martial\nmay direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that a vessel of the United\n\nStates or of the organized militia was hazarded in a certain manner; and\n(ii)\nthat the accused by\ncertain acts or omissions, willfully and wrongfully or negligently, caused or\nsuffered the vessel to be hazarded. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Hazard\nmeans to put in\ndanger of loss or injury. Actual damage to, or loss of, a vessel of the Armed\n\nForces by collision, stranding, running upon a shoal or a rock, or by any other\ncause, is conclusive evidence that the vessel was hazarded but not of the fact\nof culpability on the part of any particular person. Stranded\nmeans run aground so that the vessel is fast for a time. If the vessel \"touches\nand goes,\" she is not stranded; if she \"touches and sticks,\" she is. A shoal is\na sand, mud, or gravel bank or bar that makes the water shallow. (ii)\n\nAs used in this Article, willfully\nmeans intentionally and\nwrongfully\nmeans contrary to law, regulation, lawful order, or custom. (iii)\n\nNegligence\nas used in\nthis Article means the failure to exercise the care, prudence, or attention to\nduties, which the interests of the government require a prudent and reasonable\nperson to exercise under the circumstances. This negligence may consist of the\nomission to do something the prudent and reasonable person would have done, or\nthe doing of something which such a person would not have done under the\ncircumstances. No person is relieved of culpability who fails to perform such\nduties as are imposed by the general responsibilities of that person's grade or\nrank, or by the customs of the service for the safety and protection of vessels\nof the Armed Forces, simply because these duties are not specifically\nenumerated in a regulation or order. However, a mere error in judgment that a\nreasonably able person might have committed under the same circumstances does\nnot constitute an offense under this Article. (iv)\n\nTo\nsuffer\nmeans to\nallow or permit. A ship is willfully suffered to be hazarded by one who, although not in direct control of the vessel, knows a danger to be imminent but\ntakes no steps to prevent it as by a plotting officer of a ship under way who\nfails to report to the officer of the deck a radar target which is observed to\nbe on a collision course with, and dangerously close to, the ship. A suffering\nthrough neglect implies an omission to take such measures as were appropriate\nunder the circumstances to prevent a foreseeable danger. (4)\n\nLesser included offenses. (i) Willfully and wrongfully hazarding a\nvessel: (a) ML, 130.105 - negligently\nhazarding a vessel; (b) ML, 130.76\n- attempts. (ii)\n\nWillfully and wrongfully suffering a vessel to be hazarded: (a) ML, 130.105 - negligently suffering a\nvessel to be hazarded; (b) ML, 130.76 - attempts. (5)\n\nSample specifications.

(ii)\n\nHazarding of vessel, negligently. (a) Example 1. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), on ______19__, while serving in command of the ______, making entrance to (Boston Harbor), did\nnegligently hazard the said vessel by failing and neglecting to maintain or\ncause to be maintained an accurate running plot of the true position of said\nvessel while making said approach, as a result of which neglect the said\n______, at or about ______, hours on the day aforesaid, became stranded in the\nvicinity of (Channel Buoy Number Three). (b) Example 2. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), on ______, while serving as navigator of the ______, cruising on special service in the\n______ ocean off the coast of ______, notwithstanding the fact that at about\nmidnight, ______19__, the ______ point of ______ bore abeam and was about\n______ miles distant, the said ship being then under way and making a speed of\nabout 10 knots, and well knowing the position of the said ship at the time\nstated, and that the charts of the locality were unreliable and the currents\nthereabouts uncertain, did then and there negligently hazard the said vessel by\nfailing and neglecting to exercise proper care and attention in navigating said\nship while approaching ______ Island, in that he/she neglected and failed to\nlay a course that would carry said ship clear of the last aforesaid island, and\nto change the course in due time to avoid disaster; and the said ship, as a\nresult of said negligence on the part of said ______, ran upon a rock off the\n______ coast of ______ Island, at about ______hours, ______ 19 __, in\nconsequence of which the said ______ was lost. (c) Example 3. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), on ______19__, while serving as navigator of the ______ and well knowing that at about sunset\nof said day the said ship had nearly run her estimated distance from the ______\nposition, obtained and plotted by him/her, to the position of ______, and well\nknowing the difficulty of sighting ______, from a safe distance after sunset, did then and there negligently hazard the said vessel by failing and neglecting\nto advise his/her commanding officer to lay a safe course for said ship to the\nnorthward before continuing on a ______ course, as it was the duty of said\n______ to do; in consequence of which the said ship was, at about ______ hours\non the day above mentioned, run upon ______ bank in the ______ sea, About\nlatitude ______ degrees, __ minutes, ______, and longitude ______ degrees, __\nminutes ______, and seriously injured. (iii)\n\nSuffering a vessel to be hazarded, negligently. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), while serving\nas combat intelligence center officer on board the ______, making passage from\n______ to ______, and having, between ______ and ______ hours on ______19 __, been duly informed of decreasing radar ranges and constant radar bearing\nindicating that the said ______was upon a collision course approaching a radar\ntarget, did then and there negligently suffer the said vessel to be hazarded by\nfailing and neglecting to report said collision course with said radar target\nto the officer of the deck, as it was his/her duty to do, and he/she, the said\n______, through negligence, did cause the said ______ to collide with the\n______ at or about ______ hours on said date, with resultant damage to both\nvessels. (ah)\n\nDrunken or reckless\ndriving. (1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who, while on active state\nduty or in a duty status other than active state duty, operates any vehicle\nwhile drunk, or in a reckless or wanton manner, or while impaired by drugs, shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that the accused was on active state duty\nor in a duty status other than active state duty at the time of the\noffense; (ii)\nthat the accused was\noperating a vehicle; and\n(iii)\nthat\nthe accused was drunk while operating the vehicle; or that the accused operated\nthe vehicle in a reckless or wanton manner. Note: [If injury resulted add the following\nelement.]\n(iv)\nthat the\naccused thereby caused the vehicle to injure a person. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Active state duty or in a duty status\nother than active state duty (See subparagraph (af)(3)(i) of this\nsection). (ii)\n\nVehicle (See\nN.Y.R.C.M. 103[34]). Drunken or reckless operation of water and air\ntransportation may be alleged under other articles of the code, as\nappropriate. (iii)\n\nOperating. Operating a vehicle includes not only driving or guiding it while in motion, either in person or through the agency of another, but also the setting of its\nmotive power in action or the manipulation or its controls so as to cause the\nparticular vehicle to move. (iv)\n\nDrunk\nand\nimpaired\nmeans any intoxication\nwhich is sufficient sensibly to impair the rational and dull exercise of the\nmental or physical faculties. Whether the drunkenness or impairment was caused\nby liquor or drugs is immaterial. (v) Reckless. The operation of a vehicle is\nreckless\nwhen it exhibits a culpable disregard of foreseeable\nconsequences to others from the act or omission involved. Recklessness is not\ndetermined solely by reason of the happening of an injury, or the invasion of\nthe rights of another, nor by proof alone of excessive speed or erratic\noperation, but all these factors may be admissible and relevant as bearing upon\nthe ultimate question: whether, under all the circumstances, the accused's\nmanner of operation of the vehicle was of that heedless nature which made it\nactually or imminently dangerous to the occupants, or to the rights or safety\nof others. It is driving with such a high degree of negligence that if death\nwere caused, the accused would have committed involuntary manslaughter, at\nleast. The condition of the surface on which the vehicle is operated, the time\nof day or night, the traffic, and the condition of the vehicle are often\nmatters of importance in the proof of an offense charged under this Article, and, where they are of importance, may properly be alleged. (vi)\n\nWanton. Wanton\nincludes\n\"reckless\", but in describing the operation of a vehicle, it may, in a proper\ncase, connote willfulness, or a disregard of probable consequences, and thus\ndescribe a more aggravated offense. (vii)\n\nSeparate offenses. While the same\ncourse of conduct may constitute both drunken and reckless driving, this\n\nArticle prescribes these are separate offenses, and both offenses may be\ncharges. However, as recklessness is a relative matter, evidence of all the\nsurrounding circumstances which made the operation dangerous, whether alleged\nor not, may be admissible. Thus, on a charge of reckless driving, evidence of\ndrunkenness might be admissible as establishing one aspect of the recklessness, and evidence that the vehicle exceeded a safe speed, at a relevant prior point\nand time, might be admissible as corroborating other evidence of the specific\nrecklessness charged. Similarly, on a charge of drunken driving, relevant\nevidence of recklessness might have probative value as corroborating other\nproof of drunkeness. (4)\n\nLesser included offenses. Drunken driving. (i) ML, 130.107 - drunk on duty; (ii)\nML, 130.115 - drunk on\nstation. (5)\n\nSample\nspecification.

(ai)\n\nDrunk on duty-misbehavior. (1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who is found drunk on duty\nor drunk or sleeping upon his post, or who leaves his post before he is\nregularly relieved, shall be punished as a court-martial may\ndirect.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. (i) that the accused was on a certain duty or\nwas posted or on post as a sentinel or lookout; (ii)\nthat the accused was found drunk while\non that duty or post, was found sleeping while on post, or left post before\nbeing regularly relieved. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) In general. This article encompasses the\noffenses found in articles 112 and 113 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and defines four kinds of misbehavior committed by those on duty as sentinels, lookouts, or otherwise, being found drunk on duty, or sleeping or leaving it\nbefore being regularly relieved. (ii)\n\nPost. Post\nis the area\nwhere the sentinel or lookout is required to be for the performance of duties. It is not limited by an imaginary line, but includes, according to orders or\ncircumstances, such surrounding area as may be necessary for the proper\nperformance of the duties for which the sentinel or lookout goes an immaterial\ndistance from the post, unless it is such a distance that the ability to fully\nperform the duty for which posted is impaired. (iii)\n\nOn post. A sentinel or lookout becomes\n\"on post\" after having been given a lawful order to go \"on post\" as a sentinel\nor lookout and being formally or informally posted. The fact that a sentinel or\nlookout is not posted in the regular way is not a defense. It is sufficient, for example, the sentinel or lookout has taken the post in accordance with\nproper instruction, whether or not formally given. A sentinel or lookout is on\npost within the meaning of the article not only when at a post physically\ndefined, as is ordinarily the case in garrison or aboard ship, but also, for\nexample, when stationed in observation against the approach of an enemy, or\ndetailed use any equipment designed to locate friend, foe, or possible danger, or at a designated place to maintain internal discipline, or to guard stores, or to guard prisoners while in confinement or at work. (iv)\n\nSentinel or lookout. A sentinel or\nlookout is a person whose duties include the requirement to maintain constant\nalertness, be vigilant, and remain awake, in order to observe for the possible\napproach of the enemy, or to guard persons, property, or a place and to sound\nthe alert, if necessary. (v) Duty\nas used in this Article means military duty. Every duty\nwhich an officer or enlisted person may legally be required by superior\nauthority to execute is necessarily a military duty. Within the meaning of this\n\nArticle, when in the actual exercise of command, the commander of a post, or of\na command, or of a detachment in the field is constantly on duty, as is the\ncommanding officer on board a ship. In the case of other officers or enlisted\npersons, \"on duty\" relates to duties of routine or detail, in garrison, at a\nstation, or in the field, and does not relate to those periods when no duty\nbeing required of them by orders or regulations, officers and enlisted persons\noccupy the status of leisure known as \"off duty\" or \"on liberty\". In a region\nof active hostilities, the circumstances are often such that all members of a\ncommand may properly be considered as being continuously on duty within the\nmeaning of this Article. So also, an officer of the day and members of the\nguard, or of the watch, are on duty during their entire tour within the meaning\nof this Article. (vi)\n\nDrunk. For an\nexplanation of \"drunk\", see subparagraph (ah)(3)(iv) of this section. (vii)\n\nSleeping. As used in this Article, sleeping\nis that condition of insentience which is sufficient\nsensibly to impair the full exercise of the mental and physical faculties of a\nsentinel or lookout. It is not necessary to show that the accused was in a\nwholly comatose condition. (viii)\n\nDefenses. The fact that the accused's sleeping resulted from a physical\nincapacity caused by disease or accident is an affirmative defense (See\nN.Y.R.C.M. 916[i]). If the accused is known by superior authorities to be drunk\nat the time a duty is assigned and the accused is allowed to assume that duty\nanyway or if the drunkenness resulted from an accidental over dosage\nadministered for medicinal purposes, the accused will have a defense to an\noffense wherein drunkenness is an element. But see subdivision (ay) of this\nsection (incapacitation for duty). (4)\n\nLesser included offenses: (i) Drunk on duty. ML, 130.115 - drunk on station; (ii)\n\nDrunk on post; (a) ML, 130.107 - drunk on duty; (b) ML, 130.88 - dereliction of\nduty; (c) ML, 130.115 - drunk on\nstation; (d) ML, 130.115 - drunk in\nuniform in a public place. (iii)\n\nSleeping on post: (a) ML, 130.88 - dereliction of\nduty; (b) ML, 130.115 - loitering\nor wrongfully sitting down on post. (iv)\n\nLeaving post: (a) ML, 130.88 - dereliction of\nduty; (b) ML, 130.82 - going from\nappointed place of duty. (5)\n\nSample specifications. (i) Drunk on duty.

(iv)\n\nFailure to report a duel: (a) that the accused was on active state duty\nor in a duty status other than active state duty at the time of the\noffense; (b) that a challenge to\nfight a duel had been sent or was about to be sent; (c) that the accused had knowledge of this\nchallenge; and\n(d) that the accused\nfailed to report this fact promptly to proper authority. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Active state duty or in a duty status\nother than active state duty (see subparagraph [af][3][i] of this\nsection). (ii)\n\nDuel. A\nduel\nis combat between two persons for private reasons fought\nwith deadly weapons by prior agreement. (iii)\n\nPromoting a duel. Urging or taunting\nanother to challenge or to accept a challenge to duel, acting as a second or as\ncarrier of a challenge or acceptance, or otherwise furthering or contributing\nto the fighting of a duel are examples of promoting a duel.

(ak)\n\nMalingering. (1)\n\nText. \"Any person subject to this code who for the purpose of\navoiding work, duty, or service in the militia-\n(1)\nfeigns illness, physical disablement, mental lapse or derangement; or\n(2)\nintentionally inflicts self-injury; shall be punished as a court-martial may\ndirect.\"\n(2)\n\nElements: (i) that the accused was assigned to, or was\naware of prospective assignment to, or availability for, the performance of\nwork, duty, or service in the militia; (ii)\nthat the accused feigned illness, physical disablement, mental lapse or derangement, or intentionally inflicted\ninjury upon himself or herself; and\n(iii)\nthat the accused's purpose or intent in\ndoing so was to avoid the work, duty, or service. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Nature of offense. The essence of this\noffense is the design to avoid performance of any work, duty, or service which\nmay properly or normally be expected of one in the militia. Whether to avoid\nall duty, or only a particular job, it is the purpose to shirk which\ncharacterizes this offense. Hence, the nature or permanency of a self-inflicted\ninjury is not material on the question of guilty, nor is the seriousness of a\nphysical or mental disability which is a sham. Evidence of the extent of the\nself-inflicted injury or feigned disability may, however, be relevant as a\nfactor indicating the presence or absence of the purpose. (ii)\n\nHow injury inflicted. The injury may be\ninflicted by nonviolent as well as by violent means and may be accomplished by\nany act or omission which produces, prolongs, or aggravates any sickness or\ndisability. Thus, voluntary starvation which results in debility is a\nself-inflicted injury and when done for the purpose of avoiding work, duty, or\na service constitutes a violation of this Article.

(i) Riot: (a) that the accused was on active state duty\nor in a duty status other than active state duty at the time of the\noffense; (b) that the accused was a\nmember of an assembly of three or more persons; (c) that the accused and at least two other\nmembers of this group mutually intended to assist one another against anyone\nwho might oppose them in doing an act for some private purpose; (d) that the group or some of its members, in\nfurtherance of such purpose, unlawfully committed a tumultuous disturbance of\nthe peace in a violent or turbulent manner; and\n(e) that these acts terrorized the public in\ngeneral in that they caused or were intended to cause public alarm or\nterror. (ii)\n\nBreach of\nthe peace: (a) that the accused was on active\nstate duty or in a duty status other than active state duty at the time of the\noffense; (b) that the accused\ncaused or participated in a certain act of a violent or turbulent nature; and\n(c) that the peace was thereby\nunlawfully disturbed. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Active state duty or in a duty status\nother than active state duty (see subparagraph [af][3][i] of this\nsection). (ii)\n\nRiot\nis a tumultuous disturbance of the peace by three or more\npersons assembled together in furtherance of a common purpose to execute some\nenterprise of a private nature by concerted action against anyone who might\noppose them, committed in such a violent and turbulent manner as to cause or be\ncalculated to cause public terror. The gravamen of the offense of riot is\nterrorization of the public. It is immaterial whether the act intended was\nlawful. Furthermore, it is not necessary that the common purpose be determined\nbefore the assembly. It is sufficient if the assembly begins to execute in a\ntumultuous manner a common purpose formed after it assembled. (iii)\nA\nbreach of the peace\nis an unlawful disturbance of the peace by an outward demonstration of a\nviolent or turbulent nature. The acts or conduct contemplated by this Article\nare those which disturb the public tranquility or impinge upon the peace and\ngood order to which the community is entitled. Engaging in an affray and\nunlawful discharge of firearms in a public street are examples of conduct which\nmay constitute a breach of the peace. Loud speech and unruly conduct may also\nconstitute a breach of the peace by the speaker. A speaker may also be guilty\nor causing a breach of the peace if the speaker uses language which can\nreasonably be expected to produce a violent or turbulent response and a breach\nof the peace results. The fact that the words are true or used under\nprovocation is not a defense, nor is tumultuous conduct excusable because\nincited by others.

(i) Giving false testimony: (a) that the accused took an oath or\naffirmation in a certain judicial proceeding or course of justice; (b) that the oath or affirmation was\nadministered to the accused in a matter in which an oath or affirmation was\nrequired or authorized by law; (c) that the oath or affirmation was administered by a person having authority to\ndo so; (d) that upon the oath or\naffirmation the accused willfully gave certain testimony; (e) that the testimony was\nmaterial; (f) that the testimony\nwas false. (ii)\n\nSubscribing false statement: (a) that the\naccused subscribed a certain statement in a judicial proceeding or course of\njustice; (b) that in the\ndeclaration, certification, verification or statement under the penalty of\nperjury, the accused declared, certified, verified or stated the truth of that\ncertain state ment; (c) that the\naccused willfully subscribed the statement; (d) that the statement was\nmaterial; (e) that the statement\nwas false; and\n(f) that the accused\ndid not then believe the statement to be true. (iii)\n\nThat the accused did not then believe\nthe testimony to be true. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) In general. \"Judicial proceeding\"\nincludes a trial by court-martial and \"course of justice\" includes an\ninvestigation conducted under 130.32, ML. If the accused is charged with having\ncommitted perjury before a court-martial, it must be shown that the\ncourt-martial was duly constituted. (ii)\n\nGiving false testimony. (a) Nature. The testimony must be false and\nmust be willfully and corruptly given; that is, it must be proved that the\naccused gave the false testimony willfully and did not believe it to be true. A\nwitness may commit perjury by testifying to the truth of matter when in fact\nthe witness knows nothing about it at all or is not sure about it, whether the\nthing is true or false in fact. A witness may also commit perjury in testifying\nfalsely as to a belief, remembrance, or impression, or as to a judgment or\nopinion. It is no defense that the witness voluntarily appeared, that the\nwitness was incompetent as a witness, or that the testimony was given in\nresponse to questions that the witness could have declined to answer. (b) Material matter. The false testimony must\nbe with respect to a material matter, but that matter need not be the main\nissue in the case. Thus, perjury may be committed by giving false testimony\nwith respect to the credibility of a material witness or in an affidavit in\nsupport of a request for a continuance, as well as by giving false testimony\nwith respect to a fact form which a legitimate inference may be drawn as the\nthe existence or nonexistence of a fact in issue. Whether the allegedly false\ntestimony was with respect to a material matter is a question of law to be\ndetermined as an interlocutory question. (c) Proof. The falsity of the allegedly\nperjured statement cannot be proved by circumstantial evidence alone, except\nwith respect to matters which by their nature are not susceptible of direct\nproof. The falsity of the statement cannot be proved by the\ntestimony of a single witness unless that testimony directly contradicts the\nstatement and is corroborated by other evidence, either direct or\ncircumstantial, tending to prove the falsity of the statement. However, documentary evidence directly disproving the truth of the statement charged to\nhave been perjured need not be corroborated if: the document is an official\nrecord shown to have been well known to the accused at the time the oath was\ntaken; or the documentary evidence originated from the accused-or had in any\nmanner been recognized by the accused as containing the truth-before the\nallegedly perjured statement was made. (d) Oath. The oath must be one recognized or\nauthorized by law and must be duly administered by one authorized to administer\nit. When a form of oath has been prescribed, a literal following of that form\nis not essential; it is sufficient if the oath administered conforms in\nsubstance to the prescribed form. Oath\nincludes an affirmation\nwhen the latter is authorized in lieu of an oath. (e) Belief of accused. The fact that the\naccused did not believe the statement to be true may be proved by testimony of\none witness without corroboration or by circumstantial evidence. (iii)\n\nSubscribing false statement, see subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, as applicable. Section 210 of\nthe New York Penal Law provides for subscribing to the truth of a document by\nsigning it expressly subject to the penalty of perjury. The signing must take\nplace in a judicial proceeding or course of justice. For example, if a witness\nsigns under penalty of perjury, summarized testimony given at a ML 130.32\ninvestigation, it is not required that the document be sworn before a third\nparty. Section 210 does not change the requirement that a deposition be given\nunder oath or alter the situation where an oath is required to be taken before\na specific person.

(iv)\n\nFalse oath in connection with\nclaims: (a) that the accused made an oath to a\ncertain fact or to a certain writing or other paper; (b) that the oath was false in certain\nparticulars; (c) that the accused\nthen knew it was false; and\n(d) that the act was for the purpose of obtaining the approval, allowance, or\npayment of a certain claim or claims against the United States, the state or an\nofficer thereof. (v) Forgery of signature in connection with claims: (a) that the accused forged or counterfeited\nthe signature of a certain person on a certain writing or other paper; and\n(b) that the act was for the\npurpose of obtaining the approval, allowance, of payment of a certain claim\nagainst the United States, the state, or an office thereof.

(vii)\n\nDelivering less than amount called for\nby receipt: (a) that the accused had charge, possession, custody, or control of certain money or property of the United\n\nStates, or the state, or an officer thereof or any of them; (b) that the accused obtained a certificate\nor receipt for a certain amount or quantity of that money or\nproperty; (c) that for the\ncertificate or receipt the accused knowingly delivered to a certain person\nhaving authority to receive it an amount or quantity of money or property less\nthan the amount or quantity thereof specified in the certificate or receipt; and\n(d) that the undelivered money\nor property was of a certain value. (viii)\n\nMaking or delivering receipt without\nhaving full knowledge that it is true: (a) that the accused was authorized to make or deliver a paper certifying the\nreceipt form a certain person of certain property of the United States or the\nstate furnished or intended for the Armed Forces thereof or any of\nthem; (b) that the accused made or\ndelivered to that person a certificate or receipt; (c) that the accused made or delivered the\ncertificate without having full knowledge or the truth of a certain material\nstatement or statements therein; (d) that the act was done with intent to\ndefraud the United States, or the state; and\n(e) that the property certified as being\nreceived was of a certain value. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Making a false or fraudulent claim: (a) Claim. A\nclaim\nis a\ndemand for a transfer of ownership of money or property and does not include\nrequisitions for the mere use of property. This Article applies only to claims\nagainst the United States, the State or any officer thereof as such, and not to\nclaims against an officer of the United States or of New York in that officer's\nprivate capacity. (b) Making a\nclaim. Making a claim is a distinct act from presenting it. A claim may be made\nin one place and presented in another. The mere writing of a paper in the form\nof a claim, without any further act to cause the paper to become a demand\nagainst the United States, the State, or an officer thereof, does not\nconstitute making a claim. However, any act placing the claim in official\nchannels constitutes making a claim, even if that act does not amount to\npresenting a claim. It is not necessary that the claim be allowed or paid or\nthat it be made by the person to be benefited by the allowance or payment (see\nalso subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph). (c) Knowledge. The claim must be made with\nknowledge of its fictitious or dishonest character. This article does not\nproscribe claims, however groundless they may be, that the maker believes to be\nvalid, or claims that are merely made negligently or without ordinary\nprudence. (ii)\n\nPresenting\nfor approval or payment a false or fraudulent claim. (a) False and fraudulent. False and\nfraudulent claims include not only those containing some material false\nstatement, but also claims which the claimant knows to have been paid or for\nsome other reason the claimant knows the claimant is not authorized to present\nor upon which the claimant knows the claimant has no right to\ncollect. (b) Presenting a claim. The claim must be presented, directly or indirectly, to some person having\nauthority to pay it. The person to whom the claim is presented may be\nidentified by position or authority to approve the claim, and need not be\nidentified by name in the specification. A false claim may be tacitly\npresented, as when a person who knows that there is no entitlement to certain\npay accepts it nevertheless without disclosing a disqualification, even though\nthe person may not have made any representation of entitlement to the pay. For\nexample, a person cashing a paycheck which includes an amount for a dependency\nallowance, knowing at the time that the entitlement no longer exists because of\na change in that dependency status, has tacitly presented a false claim (see\nalso subparagraph [i] of this paragraph). (iii)\n\nMaking or using a false writing or\nother paper in connection with claims. The false or fraudulent statement must\nbe material, that is, it must have a tendency to mislead governmental officials\nin their consideration or investigation of the claim. The offense of mailing a\nwriting or other paper known to contain a false or fraudulent statement for the\npurpose of obtaining the approval, allowance, or payment of a claim is complete\nwhen the writing or paper is made for that purpose, whether or not any use of\nthe paper has been attempted and whether or not the claim has been presented\n(see also the explanation in subparagraphs [i] and [ii] of this\nparagraph). (iv)\n\nFalse oath in\nconnection with claims (see subparagraphs [i] and [ii] of this\nparagraph). (v) Forgery of\nsignature in connection with claims. Any fraudulent making of the signature of\nanother is forging or counterfeiting, whether or not an attempt is made to\nimitate the handwriting (see paragraph [iv][3] of this section and\nsubparagraphs [i] and [ii] of this paragraph). (vi)\n\nDelivering less than amount called for\nby receipt. It is immaterial by what means-whether deceit, collusion, or\notherwise-the accused effected the transaction, or what was the accused's\npurpose. (vii)\n\nMaking or delivering\nreceipt without having full knowledge that it is true. When an officer or other\nperson subject to military law is authorized to make or deliver any paper\ncertifying the receipt of any property of the United States or the state\nfurnished or intended for the Armed Forces thereof, and a receipt or other\npaper is presented for signature stating that a certain amount of supplies has\nbeen furnished by a certain contractor, it is that person's duty before signing\nthe paper to know that the full amount of supplies therein stated to have been\nfurnished has in fact been furnished, and that the statements contained in the\npaper are true. If the person signs the paper with intent to defraud the United\n\nStates or the state and without that knowledge, that person is guilty of a\nviolation of this section of the article. If the person signs the paper with\nknowledge that the full amount was not received, it may be inferred that the\nperson intended to defraud the United States or the state. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 -\nattempts). (5)\n\nSample\nspecifications. (i) Making false claim. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or about\n______ 19 __, [by preparing (a voucher) ( ______) for presentment for approval\nor payment] [ ______], make a claim against the [(United States) (States of New\n\nYork)] (finance officer at ______) in the amount of $ __for [private property\nalleged to have been (lost) (destroyed) in the military service] [______], which claim was (false) (fraudulent) (false and fraudulent) in the amount of $\n______ in that ______ and was then known by the said ______ to be (false)\n(fraudulent) (false and fraudulent).

(ap)\n\nConduct unbecoming an\nofficer and gentleman. (ML, 130.114)\n(1)\n\nText. \"Any officer, who is convicted of conduct unbecoming an\nofficer and a gentleman shall be punished as a court-martial may\ndirect.\"\n(2)\n(i) that the accused did or omitted to do\ncertain acts; and\n(ii)\nthat, under\nthe circumstances, these acts or omissions constituted conduct unbecoming an\nofficer and a gentleman. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Gentleman. As used in this Article, gentleman\nincludes both male and female officers. (ii)\n\nNature of offense. Conduct violative of\nthis Article is action or behavior in an official capacity which, in\ndishonoring or disgracing the person as an officer, seriously compromises the\nofficer's character as a gentleman, or action or behavior in an unofficial or\nprivate capacity which, in dishonoring or disgracing the officer personally, seriously compromises the person's standing as an officer. There are certain\nmoral attributes common to the ideal officer and the perfect gentleman, a lack\nof which is indicated by acts of dishonesty, unfair dealing, indecency, indecorum, lawlessness, injustice, or cruelty. Not everyone is or can be\nexpected to meet unrealistically high moral standards, but there is a limit of\ntolerance based on customs of the service and military necessity below which\nthe personal standards of an officer cannot fall without seriously compromising\nthe person's standing as an officer or the person's character as a gentleman. This article prohibits conduct as officer which, taking all the circumstances\ninto consideration, is thus compromising. This article includes acts made\npunishable by any other article, provided these acts amount to conduct\nunbecoming an officer and a gentleman. Whenever the offense charged is the same\nas a specific offense set forth in this Chapter, the elements of proof are the\nsame as those set forth in the paragraph which treats that specific offense, with the additional requirement that the act or omission constitutes conduct\nunbecoming an officer and gentleman. (iii)\n\nExamples of offenses. Instances of\nviolation of this Article include knowingly making a false official statement; dishonorable failure to pay a debt; cheating on an exam; opening and reading a\nletter of another without authority; using insulting or defamatory language to\nanother officer in that officer's presence or about that officer to other\nmilitary persons; being drunk and disorderly in a public place; public\nassociation with known prostitutes; committing or attempting to commit a crime\ninvolving moral turpitude; and failing without good cause to support the\nofficer's family. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 - attempts). (5)\n\nSample specifications. (i) Copying or using examination paper. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ______ 19 __, while undergoing a written\nexamination on the subject of ______, wrongfully and dishonorably (receive)\n(request) unauthorized aid by [(using) (copying) the examination paper of ]\n[______]. (ii)\n\nDrunk or\ndisorderly. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), was, (at/on\nboard - location), on or about ______ 19 __, in a public place, to wit: ______, (drunk) (disorderly) (drunk and disorderly) while in uniform, to the disgrace\nof the organized militia. (aq)\n\nGeneral article. [ML, 130.115]\n(1)\n\nText. \"Though not specifically mentioned in this code, all\ndisorders and neglects to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the\norganized militia and all conduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the\norganized militia of a force thereof, of which persons subject to this code may\nbe guilty, shall be taken cognizance of by a general or special or summary\ncourt-martial, according to the nature and degree of the offense, and punished\nat the discretion of such court.\"\n(2)\n\nElements. The following proof is required\nto punish the offense as a disorder or neglect to the prejudice of good order\nand discipline in the organized militia, or of a nature to bring discredit upon\nthe organized militia of a force thereof: (i) that the accused did or failed to do certain acts; and\n(ii)\nthat, under the circumstances, the\naccused's conduct was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the\norganized militia or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the organized\nmilitia of a force thereof. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) In general. ML, 130.115 makes punishable\nacts in two categories of offenses not specifically covered in any other\narticle of the code. These are referred to as \"clauses 1 and 2\" of ML, 130.115. Clause 1 offenses involved disorders and neglects to the prejudice of good\norder and discipline in the organized militia. Clause 2 offenses involve\nconduct of a nature to bring discredit upon the organized militia or a force\nthereof. If any conduct of this nature is specifically made punishable by\nanother article of the code, it must be charged as a violation of that article. See clause (v)(\na\n) of this paragraph. However, see paragraph\n(bg)(3) of this section for offenses committed by officers. (ii)\n\nDisorders and neglects to the prejudice\nof good order and discipline in the organized militia (clause 1). (a) To the prejudice of good order and\ndiscipline. \"To the prejudice of good order and discipline\" refers only to acts\ndirectly prejudicial to good order and discipline and not to acts which are\nprejudicial only in a remote or indirect sense. Almost any irregular or\nimproper act on the part of a member of the organized militia could be regarded\nas prejudicial in some indirect or remote sense; however, this Article does not\ninclude these distant effects. It is confined to cases in which the prejudice\nis reasonably direct and palpable. An act in violation of local civil law or of\na foreign law may be punished if it constitutes a disorder or neglect to the\nprejudice of good order and discipline in the organized militia. However, see\nN.Y.R.C.M. 302 concerning subject-matter jurisdiction. (b) Breach of custom of the service. A breach\nof a custom of the service may result in a violation of clause 1 of ML, 130.115. In its legal sense, custom means more than a method of procedure or a\nmode of conduct or behavior which is merely of frequent or usual occurrence. Custom arises out of long established practices which by common usage have\nattained the force of law in the military or other community affected by them. No custom may be contrary to existing law or regulation. A custom which has not\nbeen adopted by existing statute or regulation ceases to exist when its\nobservance has been generally abandoned. Many customs of the service are now\nset forth in regulations of the various forces of the organized militia. Violations of these customs should be charged under ML, 130.88 as violations of\nthe regulations in which they appear if the regulation is punitive. See\nparagraph (p)(3) of this section. (iii)\n\nConduct of a nature to bring discredit\nupon the organized militia or a force thereof (clause 2). Discredit\nmeans to injure the reputation of. This clause of\nML, 130.115 makes punishable conduct which has a tendency to bring the service\ninto disrepute or which tends to lower it in public esteem. Acts in violation\nof a local civil law or a foreign law may be punished if they are of a nature\nto bring discredit upon the Armed Forces. However, see N.Y.R.C.M. 203\nconcerning subject-matter jurisdiction. (iv)\n\nPreemption doctrine. The preemption\ndoctrine prohibits application of ML, 130.115 to conduct covered by ML, 130.73\nthrough ML, 130.113. (v) Drafting\nspecifications for offenses under ML, 130.115. (a) In general. A specification alleging a\nviolation of ML, 130.115 need not expressly allege that the conduct was \"a\ndisorder or neglect,\" that it was \"of a nature to bring discredit upon the\norganized militia or a force thereof.\" The same conduct may constitute a\ndisorder or neglect to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the\norganized militia and at the same time be of a nature to bring discredit upon\nthe organized militia of a force thereof. (b) Specifications for clause 1 or 2 offenses\nnot listed. If conduct by an accused does not fall under any of the listed\noffenses for violations of section\n130.15\nin this Chapter (subdivisions [ar]\nthrough [bn] of this section) a specification not listed in this Chapter may be\nused to allege the offense. (ar)\n\nAbusing public animal. [ML, 130.115]. (1)\n\nText. See subdivision (aq) of this section. (2)\n\nElements: (i) that the accused wrongfully abused a\ncertain public animal; and\n(ii)\nthat, under the circumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice\nof good order and discipline in the organized militia or was of a nature to\nbring discredit upon the organized militia or a force thereof. (3)\n\nExplanation. A public animal\nis any animal owned or used by the United States; any animal owned or used by a\nlocal or State government in the United States, its territories or possessions; or any wild animal located on any public lands in the United States, the state, its territories or possessions. This would include, for example, drug detector\ndogs used by the U.S. or State government. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 -\nattempts). (5)\n\nSample\nspecification. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did (at/on\nboard - location) (subject-matter jurisdiction data, if required), on or about\n______ 19 __, wrongfully (kick a public drug detector dog in the nose) (\n______). (as)\n\nCorrectional custody - offenses against. [ML, 130.115]\n(1)\n\nText. See subdivision (aq) of this section. (2)\n\nElements. (i) Escape from correctional custody: (a) that the accused was placed in\ncorrectional custody by a person authorized to do so; (b) that, while in such correctional custody, the accused was under physical restraint; (c) that the accused freed himself of herself\nfrom the physical restraint of this correctional custody before being released\ntherefrom by proper authority; and\n(d) that, under the circumstances, the\nconduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the\norganized militia or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the organized\nmilitia or a force thereof. (ii)\n\nBreach of correctional custody: (a) that the accused was placed in\ncorrectional custody by a person authorized to do so; (b) that, while in correctional custody, a\ncertain restraint was imposed upon the accused; (c) that the accused went beyond the limits\nof the restraint imposed before having been released from the correctional\ncustody or relieved of the restraint by proper authority; and\n(d) that, under the circumstances, the\nconduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order and discipline in the\norganized militia or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the organized\nmilitia or a force thereof. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Escape from correctional custody. Escape\nfrom correctional custody is the act of a person undergoing the punishment of\ncorrectional custody pursuant to 130.15, ML, who, before being set at liberty\nby proper authority, casts off any physical restraint imposed by the custodian\nor by the place or conditions of custody. (ii)\n\nBreach of correctional custody. Breach\nof restraint during correctional custody is the act of a person undergoing the\npunishment who, in the absence of physical restraint imposed by a custodian or\nby the place or conditions of custody, breaches any form of restraint imposed\nduring this period. (iii)\n\nAuthority\nto impose correctional custody. See Part 519 of this Title concerning who may\nimpose correctional custody. Whether the status of a person authorized that\nperson to impose correctional custody is a question of law to be decided by the\nmilitary judge. Whether the person who imposed correctional custody had such a\nstatus is a question of fact to be decided by the factfinder. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 - attempts). (5)\n\nSample\nspecifications. (i) Escape from correctional\ncustody. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), while\nundergoing the punishment of correctional custody imposed by a person\nauthorized to do so, did, (at/on board - location), on or about ______ 19 __, escape from correctional custody. (ii)\n\nBreach of correctional custody. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), while duly\nundergoing the punishment of correctional custody imposed by a person\nauthorized to do so, did, (at/on board - location), on or about ______ 19 __, breach the restraint imposed thereunder by ______. (at)\n\nDebt, dishonorably\nfailing to pay. [ML, 130.115]\n(1)\n\nText. See subdivision (aq) of this section. (2)\n\nElements. (i) that the accused was indebted to a\ncertain person or entity in a certain sum; (ii)\nthat this debt became due and payable on\nor about a certain date; (iii)\nthat\nwhile the debt was still due and payable the accused dishonorably failed to pay\nthis debt; and\n(iv)\nthat under the\ncircumstances, the conduct of the accused was to the prejudice of good order\nand discipline in the organized militia or was of a nature to bring discredit\nupon the organized militia or a force thereof. (3)\n\nExplanation. More than negligence in\nnonpayment is necessary. The failure to pay must be characterized by deceit, evasion, false promises, or other distinctly culpable circumstances indicating\na deliberate nonpayment of grossly indifferent attitude toward one's just\nobligations. For a debt to form the basis of this offense, the accused must not\nhave had a defense, or an equivalent offset or counterclaim, either in fact or\naccording to the accused's belief, at the time alleged. The offense should not\nbe charged if there was a genuine dispute between the parties as to the facts\nor law relation to the debt which would affect the obligation of the accused to\npay. The offense is not committed if the creditor or creditors involved are\nsatisfied with the conduct of the debtor with respect to payment. The length of\nthe period of nonpayment and any denial of indebtedness which the accused may\nhave made may tend to prove that the accused's conduct was dishonorable, but\nthe court-martial may convict only if it finds from all of the evidence that\nthe conduct was in fact dishonorable. (4)\n\nLesser included offenses. None. (5)\n\nSample specification. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), being indebted\nto in ______ the sum of $______ for ______, which amount became due and payable\n(on) (about) (on or about) _____19 __, dishonorably fail to pay said\ndebt.

(3)\n\nExplanation. Certain disloyal statements\nby military personnel may not constitute an offense under\n18 U.S.C. 2385, 2387, and\n2388, but may, under the circumstances, be punishable under this Article. Examples\ninclude praising the enemy, attacking the war aims of the United States, or\ndenouncing our form of government with the intent to promote disloyalty or\ndisaffection among members of the organized militia. A declaration of personal\nbelief can amount to a disloyal statement if it disavows allegiance owed to the\n\nUnited States by the declarant. The disloyalty involved for this offense must\nbe to the United States as a political entity and not merely to a department or\nother agency that is a part of its administration. (4)\n\nLesser included offense (ML, 130.76 -\nattempts). (5)\n\nSample\nspecification. In that ______ (personal jurisdiction data), did (at/on\nboard - location) on or about ______ 19 __, with intent to [promote\n(disloyalty) (disaffection) (disloyalty and disaffection)] [(interfere with)\n(impair) the (loyalty) (good order and discipline)] of any member of the Armed\n\nForces of the United States communicate to ______, the following statement, to\nwit: \" ______,\" or words to that effect, which statement was disloyal to the\n\nUnited States. (av)\n\nDisorderly conduct, drunkenness. [ML, 130.115]\n(1)\n\nText. See subdivision (aq) of this section. (2)\n\nElements: (i) that the accused was drunk, disorderly, or drunk and disorderly on board ship or in some other place; and\n(ii)\nthat, under the circumstances, the\nconduct of the accused was to the prejudice or good order and discipline in the\norganized militia or was of a nature to bring discredit upon the organized\nmilitia or a force thereof. (3)\n\nExplanation. (i) Drunkenness. See subparagraph (ah)(3)(iv)\nof this section for a discussion of intoxication. (ii)\n\nDisorderly. Disorderly conduct is\nconduct of such a nature as to affect the peace and quiet of persons who may\nwitness it and who may be disturbed or provoked to resentment thereby.
