(c) APG relative weight shall mean a numeric\nvalue that reflects the relative expected average resource utilization (cost)\nfor each APG as compared to the expected average resource utilization for all\nother APGs. Procedure-based APG weight shall mean a numeric value that reflects\nthe relative expected average resource utilization (cost) for a specific\nprocedure. A procedure that has been assigned its own weight shall have its\npayment derived from its procedure-specific weight without regard to the weight\nof the APG to which the procedure groups. (d) Workers' Compensation specific base rates\nshall mean the numeric value that shall be multiplied by the allowed APG weight\nfor a given APG, or by the final APG relative weight to determine the total\nallowable Workers' Compensation operating payment for a visit. (e) Consolidation, also known as\n''bundling'', shall mean the process for determining if a single payment amount\nis appropriate in those circumstances when a patient receives multiple APG\nprocedures during a single patient visit. (f) Current Procedural Terminology, fourth\nedition (CPT-4) is the systematic listing and coding of procedures and services\nprovided by physicians or other related health care providers. It is a subset\nof the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System (HCPCS). The CPT-4 and HCPCS\nare maintained by the American Medical Association and the federal Centers for\n\nMedicare and Medicaid Services and are updated annually. (g) Discounting shall mean the reduction in\nAPG payment that results when additional procedures do not consolidate. Additional occurrences of the same ancillary APG within a single visit or\nepisode will also discount. (h) APG\nSoftware System shall mean the New York State-specific version of the APG\ncomputer software developed and published by Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing\n\nCorporation (3M) to process CPT-4 and ICD-10 code information in order to\nassign patient visits to the appropriate APG category or categories and apply\nappropriate bundling, packag- ing and discounting to assign the appropriate\nfinal APG weight and associated reimbursement. (i) Final APG Weight shall mean the allowed\nAPG weight for a given visit as expressed in the applicable APG software, and\nas adjusted by all applicable consolidation, packaging and discounting and\nother applicable adjustments. (j) International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) is a\ncomprehensive coding system maintained by the federal Centers for Medicare and\n\nMedicaid Services in the US Department of Health and Human Services. It is\nmaintained for the purpose of providing a standardized, universal coding system\nto identify and describe patient diagnoses, symptoms, complaints, conditions\nand/or causes of injury or illness. It is updated annually. (k) Packaging shall mean those circumstances\nin which payment for routine ancillary services or drugs shall be deemed as\nincluded in the applicable APG payment for a related significant procedure or\nmedical visit. Medical visits also package with significant procedures, unless\nspecifically excepted herein. (l) Significant procedure APG shall mean an APG incorporating a medical procedure\nthat constitutes the primary reason for the visit in terms of time and\nresources expended. (m) Medical\nvisit APG shall mean an APG representing a visit during which a patient\nreceived medical treatment, but did not have a significant procedure\nperformed. (n) Visit shall mean a\nunit of service consisting of all the APG services performed for a patient that\nare coded on the same claim and share a common date of service. (o) Peer Group shall mean a group of\nproviders that share a common APG Workers' Compensation specific base rate. Peer groups may be established based on facility licensure, geographic region, types of services provided or categories of patients. (p) Ancillary services APGs shall mean those\nAPGs designated by the Department of Health as reflecting those tests and\nprocedures ordered by physicians to assist in patient diagnosis and/or\ntreatment.
