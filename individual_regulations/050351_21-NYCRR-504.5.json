(b) If an inspection or\ntesting period, performance verification, audit or other review or\ndocumentation independent of the contractor is specifically required by the\ncontract or by other State or Federal mandate, whether to be performed by or on\nbehalf of the authority or another entity, or is specifically permitted by the\ncontract or by other State or Federal provision and the authority or other\nentity with the right to do so elects to have such activity or documentation\nundertaken, then the payment due date shall be extended by the number of\ncalendar days from the date of receipt of an invoice to the date when any such\nactivity or documentation has been completed, the authority has actually\nreceived the results of such activity or documentation conducted by another\nentity, and any deficiencies identified or issues raised as a result of such\nactivity or documentation have been corrected or otherwise resolved. (c) If an invoice must be examined by a State\nor Federal agency, or by another party contributing to the funding of the\ncontract, prior to payment, then the payment due date shall be extended by the\nnumber of calendar days from the date of receipt of an invoice to the date when\nthe State or Federal agency, or other contributing party to the contract, has\ncompleted the inspection, advised the authority of the results of the\ninspection, and any deficiencies identified or issues raised as a result of\nsuch inspection have been corrected or otherwise resolved.
