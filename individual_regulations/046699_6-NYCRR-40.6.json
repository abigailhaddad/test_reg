It is the intent of this section to promote the prudent\nmanagement of coastal sharks that are landed in the State of New York. The\nprovisions of this section shall define which sharks may be taken for\ncommercial and recreational purposes and which sharks are prohibited from\nharvest. Size limits, possession limits, manner of taking and landing, gear\nrestrictions open and closed seasons will also be specified in this section. The provisions in this section are designed to promote healthy self-sustaining\npopulations of coastal sharks and provide for the sustainable use of the shark\nresource for the benefit of the residents of the State of New\n\nYork. (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions\napply: (1)\n\nCircle\nhook\nmeans a fishing hook originally designed and manufactured so that\nthe point is turned perpendicularly back to the shank to form a generally\ncircular, or oval, shape. (2)\n\nEviscerate\nmeans to remove the alimentary organs of a shark\nwithout removing the head. (3)\n\nFinning\nmeans the removal of a fin or fins, other than the\ncaudal fin, and not retaining the remainder of the shark's carcass (as\nspecified in Environmental Conservational Law [ECL] section\n13-0338[1][b]).

Recreational anglers fishing for sharks shall possess and have\nimmediately available wire or bolt cutters capable of quickly cutting either\nthe leader or the hook and use such cutting device to quickly remove as much\ntackle and fishing gear as possible in order to immediately, and without\nunnecessary harm release sharks not being harvested or reduced to\npossession. (iii)\n\nRelease without\nundue harm. Anglers are required to take every precaution to ensure the maximum\nprobability of survival of any shark that will be released and to release the\nshark without causing any undue harm to the shark.
