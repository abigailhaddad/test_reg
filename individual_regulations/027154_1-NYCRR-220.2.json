  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 220.2 - Specifications and tolerances\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this Part, the specifications, tolerances and\nregulations for commercial weighing and measuring devices shall be those\nadopted by the 107th National Conference on Weights and Measures 2022 as\npublished in the National Institute of Standards and Technology Handbook 44, 2023 edition. This document is available from the National Conference on\n\nWeights and Measures, 1135 M Street, Suite 110, Lincoln, NE 68508, or the\n\nSuperintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC\n20402. It is available for public inspection and copying in the office of the\n\nDirector of Weights and Measures, Department of Agriculture and Markets, 10B\nAirline Drive, Albany, NY 12235, or in the office of the Department of State, One Commerce Plaza, 99 Washington Avenue, Suite 650, Albany, New York\n12231. (b) Scales used in the sale\nof delicatessen products may continue to compute, display and record prices in\nterms of fractions of a pound. (c) The municipal authority with jurisdiction over taximeters may elect to permit\nhand written receipts for fares. (d) Scales used by stockyard owners, market agencies, dealers, packers and live poultry dealers or handlers to weigh livestock or live poultry\nfor the purpose of purchase, sale, acquisition or settlement shall be equipped\nwith a printing device which shall be capable of being used for recording\nweight values on a scale ticket or other document used for this\npurpose. (e) Gasoline dispensing\nand measuring device vapor recovery systems shall meet and be subject to the\nfollowing requirements and test procedures: (1)\n\nSuch systems shall have a primary nozzle shut-off, automatic\nin operation, to stop liquid flow when the liquid level reaches the delivery\nnozzle. (2)\n\nSuch systems shall\nhave an effective means to prevent the recirculation of liquid through the\nvapor return line, including but not limited to a secondary shut-off\ndevice. (3)\n\nSuch systems shall\ninclude a recirculation prevention device which shall shut off the flow of\nliquid prior to permitting the passage of liquid through the vapor return line\nin excess of 0.3 gallon. (4)\n\nAssist systems shall operate at the vacuum level recommended by the\nmanufacturer but not at more than 10 inches HO vacuum as measured at the nozzle\nduring delivery. (5)\n\nSuch systems\nshall operate without the failure of any component between an ambient\ntemperature of 0°F and 105°F. (6)\n\nThe following type approval test procedures and tolerances shall apply to all\nsuch vapor recovery systems: (i) The test to\ndetermine the acceptability of an individual nozzle shall be conducted\nutilizing a closed test unit. (ii)\n\nThe test procedure for primary shut-off shall positively demonstrate proper\ninitial automatic shut-off and a failure to override such shut-off in 10\nconsecutive attempts made as rapidly as the nozzle permits. For nozzles that\nwill allow a tight seal with the vehicle fill opening, the 10 attempts to\noverride shall not increase the amount indicated by the dispensing and\nmeasuring device by more than 0.1 gallon. This test shall be performed on at\nleast six representative nozzles and shall be repeated at least 10 times on\neach such nozzle. (iii)\n\nThe test\nprocedure for secondary shut-off (if so provided) shall positively demonstrate\nnozzle shut-off when an attempt is made to dispense liquid into a closed test\nunit. Prior to an attempt to dispense liquid, the vapor return line shall be\nfilled with sufficient liquid to activate the secondary shut-off device. The\nend of the nozzle must be inserted into the opening of an empty test unit with\ncare so that the liquid does not drain back into storage. This test must be\nperformed on at least six nozzles and shall be repeated at least 10 times on\neach such nozzle. (iv)\n\nPrior to a\ndelivery accuracy test, the dispensing and measuring device must be adjusted as\nclose as practicable to zero and within the acceptance tolerance for the\ndevice. (v) Compliance with\ndelivery tolerance requirements shall be based on observations of refueling of\nat least 300 vehicles under conditions representative of the anticipated range\nof actual field use. (vi)\n\nTest\nprocedures to determine compliance with delivery tolerance requirements shall\ninclude the observation of refueling operations with a liquid trap in the vapor\nreturn hose so that all liquid entering the hose can be collected and measured. Trap placement and tester actions shall be such as to produce the least\npossible change from normal operations. The trap shall be installed at the\noutlet end of the vapor hose and outside of the dispenser. The vapor return\nhose shall be drained into the trap after each refueling. The delivery\ntolerance tests shall be performed on various sizes of passenger vehicles, vans\nand trucks and shall utilize varied fuel delivery rates, hold-open clip and\nself-serve modes, complete and partial fills, fuel types and nozzle\norientations. A system shall be rejected if there is a failure during any one\nindividual delivery to meet the 0.2 percent tolerance set forth at subparagraph\n(viii) of this paragraph. (vii)\n\nThe test procedure to determine compliance with the limits of vacuum on an\nassist system shall include an appropriate gauge, pressure transducer or\nindicator installed at the nozzle. When the system is operated it must function\nwithin the limits specified by this subdivision. (viii)\n\nIn a vapor recovery systems test the\nquantity of measured product entering the vapor return line during a delivery\nshall not exceed 0.2 percent of the total fuel delivered during any one\nindividual delivery and 0.02 percent of the total fuel delivered to the 300 or\nmore vehicles fueled during the test period. (ix)\n\nThe commissioner may accept the test results from any other\njurisdiction with at least five year's experience testing such systems so long\nas the procedures and tolerances used are at least as strict as those set forth\nin this subdivision. (7)\n\nThe following field compliance test procedures and tolerances shall apply to\nall such vapor recovery systems: (i) The\nnozzle shall be inserted into the fill opening of the vehicle tank or test unit\nin accordance with the instructions on the device, if any, and common public\nusage. (ii)\nA primary shut-off\nshall occur when the nozzle is contacted by the liquid with the dispenser\noperating at any discharge rate but not less than the minimum rate allowed by\nthe hold-open clip, if any, or three gallons per minute, whichever is\nless. (iii)\n\nAfter an original\nliquid activated (primary) shut-off and with the nozzle outlet immersed in\nliquid, six additional attempts to activate the nozzle shall be made as rapidly\nas the installation permits. For nozzles that will allow a tight seal with the\nvehicle fill opening, the six additional attempts to override the nozzle shall\nnot increase the amount indicated by the dispenser by more than a total of 0.1\ngallon. The 0.1 gallon limit does not apply to vehicle tests. (iv)\n\nIf the system is equipped with a\nsecondary pressure activated shut-off, 0.1 gallon of fuel shall be poured into\nthe vapor hose while as much of the hose as permitted by the installation shall\nbe placed lower than the nozzle. The nozzle shall be placed rapidly into the\nempty test unit or a vehicle tank that is within three gallons of being full\nincluding the fill inlet. Automatic shut-off must occur when the nozzle is\nactivated. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
