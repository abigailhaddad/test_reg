  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 2.38 - Sanitary piping-Item 10p\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All sanitary piping, fittings and connections which are exposed to milk or milk\nproducts, or from which liquids may drip, drain or be drawn into milk products, consist of smooth, impervious, corrosion-resistant, nontoxic, easily cleanable\nmaterial. (b) All sanitary piping, connections and fittings consist of: (1)\nstainless steel of the AISI (American Iron and Steel Institute) 300 series; or\n(2)\nequally corrosion-resistant\nmetal which is nontoxic and nonabsorbent; or\n(3)\nheat-resistant glass; provided, that\nplastic, or rubber and rubberlike materials, which are relatively inert, resistant to scratching, scoring, decomposition, crazing, chipping and\ndistortion under normal use conditions; which are nontoxic, fat-resistant, relatively nonabsorbent; which do not impart flavor or odor to the products; and which maintain their original properties under repeated use conditions, may\nbe used for gaskets, sealing applications, and for short flexible takedown\njumpers or connections where flexibility is required for essential or\nfunctional reasons. (c) Sanitary piping, fittings and connections are designed to permit easy cleaning, kept in good repair, and free of breaks or corrosion, and contain no dead ends\nof piping in which milk may collect. (d) All interior surfaces of demountable\npiping, including valves, fittings and connections are designed, constructed\nand installed to permit inspection and drainage. (e) All cleaned-in-place milk pipelines and\nreturn-solution lines are rigid, self-draining and so supported to maintain\nuniform slope and alignment. Return-solution lines shall be constructed of\nmaterial meeting the specifications of subdivision (b) of this section. If\ngaskets are used, they shall be self-positioning, of material meeting the\nspecifications outlined in subdivision (b) of this section, and designed, finished and applied to form a smooth, flush interior surface. If gaskets are\nnot used, all fittings shall have self-positioning faces designed to form a\nsmooth, flush interior surface. All interior surfaces of welded joints in\npipelines shall be smooth and free from pits, cracks or inclusions. In the case of welded lines, the commissioner may require\nthat the installer provide a boroscope or other suitable inspection device to\ndetermine the acceptability of interior surfaces of welded lines. All welded\nsurfaces shall be approved by the commissioner. Each cleaning circuit shall\nhave access points for inspection in addition to the entrances and exits. These\nmay be valves, removable sections, fittings or other means or combinations that\nare adequate for inspection of the interior of the line. These access points\nshall be located at sufficient intervals to determine the general condition of\nthe interior surfaces of the line. Detailed plans for welded pipeline systems\nshall be submitted to the commissioner for written approval prior to\ninstallation. No alteration or addition shall be made to any welded milk\npipeline system without prior written approval from the commissioner. (f) Pasteurized milk and milk\nproducts are conducted from one piece of equipment to another only through\nsanitary milk piping. (g) All\nstainless steel lines and vessels used to convey or store any of the products\nincluded in section\n2.1\nof this Part or any ingredients\nused in the manufacture of such products, cleaning solutions or water shall be\ncolor coded so as to provide easy identification of the material contained\ntherein. The following color scheme shall be used: Raw product lines\nred\n\nPasteurized product lines\nblue\n\nCleaning solution lines\ngreen\n\nWater lines (SS only)\nyellow\n\nSugar and dairy food ingredients\norange\n\nAdditional color coding of stainless steel lines to\ndenote ingredients of special products is permitted provided it does not\nduplicate the color coding scheme described above. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n2.38\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
