  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 646-4.9 - Design requirements and performance standards for stormwater regulation\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach municipality's stormwater regulatory program shall\ninclude design requirements and performance standards which shall be not less\nprotective than the following: (a) Minor projects. The following requirements shall apply to minor projects: (1)\n\nStormwater shall be managed on-site using\nstormwater control measures designed to afford optimum protection of ground and\nsurface waters. Stormwater control measures shall be selected by giving\npreference to the best management practices for pollutant removal and flow\nattenuation. Stormwater may be calculated in accordance with the methodology in\nparagraph (b)(1) and subparagraph (b)(3)(i) of this section or, in the\nalternative, at a flat rate of 1.5 gallons of stormwater for every square foot\nof net increase in impervious area. Net increase is the difference between\npredevelopment and post-development conditions. All water from newly created\nimpervious areas which would otherwise runoff the parcel shall be directed to\nan infiltration device. Location of the infiltration device shall be determined\nbased upon soil test results. (2)\n\nStormwater control measures may include, but shall not be limited to, drywells\nof precast concrete, pits of crushed rock lined with geotextile fabric, and\ninfiltration trenches. Such measures may also include natural and human made\nlandscape features such as depressions, blind ditches, retention ponds, swales\nand others. Inlets to infiltration devices shall be protected from sediment at\nall times in order to maintain their capacity. (3)\n\nInfiltration devices shall not be\ninstalled up gradient within 20 feet of the subsurface treatment system of a\nwastewater treatment system. (4)\n\nInfiltration devices and buildings shall be located to maintain maximum\nattainable horizontal distance separation from wells, wetlands and waterbodies. Pumping stormwater shall not be permitted. (5)\n\nThe bottom of any infiltration device\nshall be a minimum of two feet above seasonal high ground water mark and two\nfeet above bedrock. (6)\n\nTemporary\nerosion controls shall be required to prevent siltation of waterbodies during\nconstruction. (7)\n\nStormwater\ncontrol measures proposed to be installed at locations with slope > 15\npercent before grading, soil percolation rate slower than 60 minutes per inch\nor which require placement of fill to meet vertical distance separations\nspecified in this Subpart shall be designed by a qualified stormwater\nprofessional. (b) Major\nprojects. The following additional requirements shall apply to major projects: (1)\n\nMethodologies for determination of runoff\nvolume. Stormwater volumes and rates of flow shall be calculated using the\nfollowing methods: (i) for small watershed\nareas (up to 20 acres), any widely accepted method including the rational\nmethod may be used; and\n(ii)\nfor\nlarger watershed areas any widely accepted method other than the rational\nmethod may be used. (2)\n\nDesign requirements for erosion controls. (i) Erosion control shall be provided for all disturbed areas in accordance with\nwith the most recently published New York State Standards and Specifications\nfor Erosion and Sediment Control. The temporary erosion control measures shall\nbe maintained continuously until permanent control measures are in service. Infiltration devices shall be protected from siltation during the period of\nconstruction and until the site is successfully revegetated by use of silt\nscreens, inlet protection devices, sediment detention ponds or other suitable\nerosion control measures. (ii)\n\nStaging of construction to facilitate erosion control shall be required. Only\nthose areas where construction is actively occurring shall remain open and\nunvegetated. All areas that are not within an active construction area shall be\nmulched and stabilized or shall be mulched and revegetated. An active\nconstruction area is defined as one that has seen substantial construction\nwithin the past seven calendar days. Mulching or revegetation for erosion\ncontrol shall be completed within 10 days following the last substantial\nconstruction activity. (3)\n\nDesign requirements for stormwater\ncontrol measures. (i) Stormwater control\nmeasures shall be designed so that there will be no increase in runoff volume\nfrom a 10-year frequency/24-hour duration storm event following development\nover the predevelopment volume. (ii)\n\nFor storm events exceeding the 10-year\ndesign storm, the stormwater control measures shall function to attenuate peak\nrunoff flow rates for a 25-year/24 hour frequency storm to be equal to or less\nthan predevelopment flow rates. For development greater than five acres, stormwater control measures shall function to attenuate peak runoff flow rates\nfor a 100-year/24 hour, storm to be equal to or less than pre-development flow\nrates. Attenuation of the 100-year storm is intended to reduce the rate of\nrunoff from development to prevent expansion of the 100-year flood plain so as\nto alleviate flooding of improved properties and roadways. The minimum\nrequirement for peak flow attenuation can be waived for the 100-year storm\nevent where it can be proven that downstream flooding is not a concern, such as\nwhere excess stormwater runoff is discharged to Lake George or to a regional\nstormwater facility designed to handle additional volume and peak discharge. The cumulative effect of all proposed development projects within the watershed\nshould be considered in making this determination. Rainfall intensity curves\nfor Lake George, NY shall be used in the design of these stormwater control\nmeasures. (iii)\n\nInfiltration\ndevices shall be designed such that the bottom of the system will be a minimum\nof two feet above the seasonal high groundwater level and bedrock to be\nrealized following development. Where compliance with this requirement would\nprevent compliance with subparagraph (b)(3)(v) of this paragraph, compliance\nwith this requirement may be waived. This provision shall not apply to wet\nponds and similar stormwater control measures which are designed to be built in\nthe saturated soil zone. (iv)\n\nStormwater recharge areas shall be located a minimum of 100 feet from the\nsubsurface treatment system of a wastewater treatment system unless it is\ndemonstrated that a lesser separation will not adversely affect the functioning\nof such leach fields. (v) Infiltration devices shall be designed to extend a minimum of 10 percent of the\ninfiltration surface area below the prevailing frost depth of four feet\n(whichever is greater) in order to provide infiltration during winter\nmonths. (vi)\n\nThe design of all\ninfiltration devices shall depend on the infiltration capacity of the soils\npresent at the project site. The design infiltration rate shall be based on the\nresults of hydrogeologic studies performed by the applicant during preparation\nof the Stormwater Control Report. The studies shall include test pits or\nborings located to present a clear picture of geologic and hydrologic\nconditions existing at the site and the areas, both on and off the site, affecting, or to be affected by, the development. A minimum of three subsurface\nexcavations shall be conducted and the results shall be included in the SCR. Interpretive logs of all excavations shall be submitted with the report. Hydrogeologic interpretations and conclusions shall be developed by qualified\npersons only. Following design of infiltration devices, additional subsurface\ninvestigations to confirm soil and groundwater conditions will be required in\nthe areas proposed for infiltration devices. The design of any project or\ndevelopment shall ensure that the ability to manage stormwater is not affected\nby the placement of structures on those soils or locations best suited for\nstormwater management purposes. (vii)\n\nAll stormwater control facilities shall\nbe designed to completely drain or return to design levels in accordance with\nthe following: infiltration basin 5 days; infiltration trench 15 days; dry well\n15 days; porous pavement 2 days; vegetated depression 1 day. (viii)\n\nPretreatment devices such as sediment\ntraps, detention/stilling basins, filter strips, grassy swales, or oil/water\nseparators shall be provided for runoff from paved areas or other areas subject\nto human-induced pollution including grease and oils, fertilizers, chemicals, road salt, sediments, organic materials and settleable solids, which shall be\nsufficient to remove pollutants from the runoff. (ix)\n\nStormwater control measures shall, at a\nminimum, incorporate the best available pollutant removal technology, which\nshall mean that which constitutes appropriate and cost effective means for\nremoving pollutants from runoff so that the resulting treated stormwater will\nnot degrade the water quality of any water body. (x) Stormwater control measures shall be\ndesigned to preserve and maintain the base flow in all streams passing through, adjoining or receiving runoff from the site. (c) General requirements for major and minor\nprojects. The following requirements shall apply to major and minor projects: (1)\n\nProjects shall comply with stream\ncorridor standards at 646-5. (2)\n\nInfiltration devices shall be located a minimum of 35 feet from Lake George and\nany downgradient drinking water supply or waterbody. Infiltration devices for\nhigh traffic areas shall be located a minimum of 100 feet from Lake George and\nany downgradient drinking water supply or water body. A separation of more than\n100 feet may be required in cases where contamination of the water supply is\npossible due to highly permeable soils, shallow groundwater and similar\nsituations. The separation distance for infiltration devices servicing high\ntraffic areas shall be minimum of 50 feet from upgradient water supplies. Designs shall mitigate the possible adverse effects that groundwater recharge\nwill have on adjacent wells, water supplies, wastewater treatment systems, buildings, roadways, properties and stormwater control measures. This design\nrequirement shall not prohibit the creation of up to 400 square feet of\npervious hardscape (i.e. porous pavers) for non-high traffic areas within 35\nfeet of Lake George and any downgradient drinking water supply or\nwaterbody. (3)\n\nStormwater control\nmeasures shall include such other measures as are deemed necessary to prevent\nany increase in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which\nwould otherwise degrade the quality of water in Lake George and its\ntributaries, render it unfit for human consumption, interfere with water-based\nrecreation or adversely affect aquatic life. (4)\n\nEmergency overflow provisions shall be\nmade as necessary to prevent erosion, flooding, and damage to structures, roads\nand stormwater control measures. (5)\n\nStormwater control measures and\ndevelopment shall be designed so as to minimize adverse impacts to water\nbodies, minimize disturbance of water bodies, minimize land clearing, minimize\nthe creation of impervious surfaces, and to maximize preservation of natural\nvegetation and existing contours. (6)\n\nDevelopment which involves the creation\nof areas subject to intensive landscape maintenance such as: golf courses, public parks and botanical gardens, shall require that a pest control and\nfertilizer management plan shall be prepared and included with the permit\napplication. (7)\n\nDevelopment that\ninvolves structural components, such as retaining walls or dams, may require\ndesign and certification by a licensed professional engineer. (8)\n\nOn a site where pre-development exists, an applicant shall be required to undertake a stormwater retrofit project to\ncontrol existing stormwater runoff discharges from the site in accordance with\nthe major project standards of this Subpart to the maximum extent practicable. Such measures shall include, at a minimum, the infiltration of runoff from the\nfirst one-half inch of precipitation from all pre-development impervious areas\nwithin the site. The phased implementation of such controls for pre-development\nareas may be authorized. A variance will not be required for infiltration\ndevices treating pre-development areas when conformance with the design\nstandards for infiltration devices cannot be met. If the minimum one-half inch\nvolume requirement cited herein cannot be met, the Commission may delegate the\nauthority to issue a variance from this standard to staff. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
