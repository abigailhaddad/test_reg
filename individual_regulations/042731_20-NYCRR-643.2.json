  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 643.2 - Computation of taxes due in the case of a taxable executory contract\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 250\n\nThe principal debt or obligation which is used as the basis\nfor computing the taxes described in Part 642 of this Part is that portion of\nthe purchase price under the contract that remains unpaid as of the date that\nthe purchaser has or is entitled to possession of the real property under the\ncontract. Example: X Corporation entered into an executory contract to sell a\n10-unit apartment building located in Flushing, Queens County, New York City to\nY for a purchase price of $600,000. On October 1, 1990 the contract was\nexecuted and pursuant to its terms Y was required to make a $60,000 down\npayment. The contract also provided that an additional payment of $100,000 was\nrequired on December 1, 1990, at which time Y was entitled to possession of the\npremises. Y will be required to make 10 semi-annual payments over a\nfive year period to X Corporation to pay the remaining balance due under the\ncontract, with the final payment due on December 1, 1995. Upon receipt of the\nfinal payment X Corporation will deliver a deed to the subject premises to\nY. Since the executory contract between C Corporation and Y\ngrants the purchaser possession of the real property prior to the delivery of\nthe deed, such contract is a mortgage, the recording of which is subject to\ntax. The taxes due upon the recording of this contract are\ncomputed as follows: Purchase price under the contract\n$600,000\n\nLess: Downpayment - October 1, 1990\n$ 60,000\n\nAdditional payment - December 1, 1990\n$100,000\n\nTotal Subtractions\n$160,000\n\nTotal amount remaining unpaid at the time Y is\nentitled to possession -\nDecember 1, 1990\n$440,000\n\nBasic tax due (($440,000 ÷ $100) × $.50)\n$ 2,200\n\nAdditional tax (($440,000 ÷ $100) × $.25)\n$ 1,100\n\nSpecial additional tax due (($440,000 ÷ $100) ×\n$.25)\n$ 1,100\n\nNew York City tax due @ $1.00 rate (($440,000 ÷ $100)\n× $1.00)\n$ 4,400\n\nTotal taxes due\n$ 8,800\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n643.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
