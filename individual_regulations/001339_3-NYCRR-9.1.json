  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 9.1 - Statement of policy\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn enacting section three of chapter one of the Laws of 1994, the Legislature has found and declared that certain consumers residing in this\n\nState may be unable to afford, without undue financial hardship, the cost of\nmaintaining a consumer transaction account at a banking institution located in\nthis State. Consequently, as provided in section\n14-f\nof the\n\nBanking Law, it is the policy of this State that, consistent with safe and\nsound banking practices, banking institutions shall make available lower cost\nbanking services to consumers, provided that no banking institution shall be\nrequired to offer lower cost banking services at a cost to account holders\nwhich is less than the actual cost to the banking institution to provide such\nservices. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n9.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
