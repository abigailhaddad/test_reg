  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 701.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Grievance - a\ncomplaint, filed with an IGP clerk, about the substance or application of any\nwritten or unwritten policy, regulation, procedure or rule of the Department of\n\nCorrectional Services or any of its program units, or the lack of a policy, regulation, procedure or rule. A letter addressed to facility or central office\nstaff is not a grievance. (b) Departmental grievance - a grievance which affects an inmate during his/her\nconfinement at various facilities throughout the department. (c) Institutional grievance - a grievance in\nwhich the grievant is only affected as long as he/ she remains a resident of\nthe facility in which the grievance is filed. (d) Like grievances - those grievances\nemanating from a substantially similar situation/issue or with a similar action\nrequested, or complaints which could be resolved with the same\naction. (e) Harassment grievances -\nthose grievances that allege employee misconduct meant to annoy, intimidate or\nharm an inmate. (f) Unlawful\ndiscrimination grievances - those grievances that allege acts or policies which\nadversely affect individuals based on race, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, age, disabling condition(s) or political belief, except as\nprovided by law. (g) Strip search\nor strip frisk grievances - those grievances that allege violations of\ndepartmental policy regarding strip searches or strip frisks. (h) Advisor - a person who assists the\ngrievant in filing, preparing or expressing the grievant's complaint. An\nadvisor is not a substitute grievant. An advisor is not needed to argue a case\nsince the grievance procedure is not adversarial. An advisor is not needed to\nappeal a grievance; that is a simple procedure requiring only that the grievant\ncontact the grievance clerk. An advisor is not a direct party to a grievance. Staff members from the IGRC or from the facility at large may serve as\nadvisors. Staff members must be willing to accept this function. (i) Direct party - an individual so uniquely\naffected by the grievance that fair play dictates that he/she should be\nafforded an opportunity to provide input prior to any decision and also to\nappeal any disposition rendered. In harassment allegations, the employee who\nallegedly committed the misconduct is a direct party. (j) Definitions related to Sexual Abuse and\n\nSexual Harassment - The terms sexual abuse and sexual harassment shall have the\ndefinitions as set forth in the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) Standards (2\n8 C.F.R. §\n115.06\n).
