  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 36-3.2 - Theatres with stages-new\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis section applies to theatres built on or after July\n1, 1957. (a) Exits. (1)\n\nMain floor entrance and exits. (i) The principal entrance shall constitute\none required means of exit but, regardless of its width, shall not be credited\nas providing more than one half the required exit capacity of the main\nfloor. (ii)\n\nThe total required\ncapacity of exit doorways other than the principal entrance, shall be divided\nbetween them approximately equally. (iii)\n\nWhere two means of exit are required, one shall be located not more than 25 feet back of the front row of seats. Where three means of exit are required, two shall be similarly located on\nopposite sides. Where five or more means of exit are required, two shall be\nsimilarly located on opposite sides and the remaining pair or pairs shall be\nlocated on opposite sides so as to divide the distance between the exit nearest\nthe front row and the rear wall of the auditorium approximately\nequally. (iv)\n\nWhere any main floor\nexit doorway other than the doorway to the lobby does not open directly on a\nlobby, court, street or public way, the passageway connecting with the street\nshall be without openings other than those for entrance and exit. (2)\n\nExit stairways serving\nbalconies and galleries. (i) Every tier above\nthe main floor shall have its required interior stairways located on opposite\nsides of the tier. Entrance to such stairways shall be direct from a crossaisle\nor from a corridor leading from a crossaisle. (ii)\n\nSuch stairways, when serving only the\nbalcony and terminating within the auditorium, lobby or foyer, may be\nunenclosed. If not terminating within the auditorium, lobby or foyer, such\nstairways shall be enclosed below the balcony level served. (iii)\n\nSuch stairways serving only the\nbalcony, may discharge to the main floor within the auditorium only if\nsubsequent exit facilities are of the aggregate width required, and the\ndischarge from such stairways is not at a greater angle than 90 degrees with\nexit travel from the main floor within the auditorium. (iv)\n\nSuch stairways serving one or more\ngalleries, shall be enclosed except at the uppermost level served, and shall\nlead directly to a ground floor lobby or foyer, a street, or an open area\nleading to a street. (v) When any\nstairway from a higher tier or level discharges to a lobby, foyer, mezzanine or\nother similar area, such area shall be separated from the auditorium by\nself-closing doors. (iv)\n\nThere shall be at\nleast one exit serving each end of each crossaisle and each such exit shall be\nnot farther from the nearest end of the crossaisle than one fourth of the\nlength of the crossaisle. There shall also be an exit not more than 75 feet\nfrom any seat, and every such exit provided along the course of the crossaisle\nshall lead by means of tunnels or otherwise directly to a corridor or hallway\ncommunicating with a stairway. (3)\n\nSupplementary (emergency) exits from\nbalconies and galleries. (i) In addition to\nthe stairways required by the previous paragraph each balcony or gallery having\na capacity, exceeding 750 persons shall be provided with at least two\nsupplementary exit stairways not less than 42 inches wide. When the capacity\nexceeds 1,500, four such supplementary exit stairways shall be provided. Supplementary interior exit stairways shall be provided with self- closing fire\ndoors, and shall lead directly to the street, or to a passageway independent of\nother exits, or to an open court leading to a street. There shall be no\ncommunication from any portion of the building to any supplementary exit\nstairway enclosure except from the tier for which the stairway is exclusively\nintended. (ii)\n\nSuch supplementary\nexit stairways, when serving only the balcony and not exceeding 35 feet in\nheight, may be exterior stairways. (4)\n\nWaiting space. Where persons are admitted\nto the building at times when seats are not available to them and are allowed\nto wait in a lobby, foyer or similar space until seats are available, the\ncapacity of such space shall be included when determining the aggregate exit\nwidth needed. (5)\n\nStage exits. At\nleast two exits shall be provided at the stage level. These exits shall be at\nopposite sides of the stage. Openings in the proscenium wall do not constitute\nrequired stage exits. (b) Seats and aisles. (1)\n\nSeats.

Such platform shall be continuous\nacross the aisle except when the rise between seat platforms is four inches or\nless and except at the first platform above a crossaisle. (2)\n\nLongitudinal aisles. (i) Aisles with seats on one side only shall\nbe at least 30 inches wide. Aisles with seats on both sides shall be at least\n36 inches wide. (ii)\n\nEvery\nlongitudinal aisle with exits at only one end shall have at least the minimum\nprescribed width where the aisle begins and shall increase in width toward the\nexits at the rate of one and one-half inches for each five feet of such aisle. If exits or crossaisles are provided at both ends, such aisle may be of uniform\nwidth throughout. This uniform width shall be not less than the average of the\nminimum width prescribed and the increased width as calculated for the length\nof aisle between crossaisles or exits. (iii)\n\nWhenever an aisle borders on a means of\nexit, the aisle shall have a width of at least four feet along the width of the\nmeans of exit.

They\nneed not extend through a side block of seats where neither a side aisle nor an\nexit door is required or provided. (ii)\n\nWhere there are less than 27 rows and\nless than four blocks of seats, a crossaisle shall extend to each sidewall exit\nnot served by a side aisle, but such crossaisle is not required to extend\nthrough the central block of seats when a crossaisle is provided in front of\nthe central block of seats. (iii)\n\nWhere there are 27 or more rows or four or more blocks of seats, crossaisles\nshall be provided dividing the number of rows approximately equally and so that\nno block of seats shall have more than 22 rows. (4)\n\nCrossaisles in balconies and galleries. (i) One or more crossaisles at least 44\ninches wide shall be provided in every balcony or gallery having more than 10\nrows of seats.
