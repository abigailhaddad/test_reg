Tit. 21 § 2500.15 - Criteria for determining what actions may have a significant effect on the environment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An\naction may have significant effect on the environment if it can reasonably be\nexpected to lead to one of the following consequences: (1)\na substantial adverse change to ambient\nair or water quality or noise levels or in solid waste production, drainage, erosion or flooding; (2)\nthe\nremoval or destruction of large quantities of vegetation or fauna, the\nsubstantial interference with the movement of any resident or migratory fish or\nwildlife species, impacts on critical habitat areas, or the substantial\naffecting of a rare or endangered species of animal or plant or the habitat of\nsuch a species; (3)\nthe encouraging\nor attracting of a large number of people to a place or places for more than a\nfew days relative to the number of people who would come to such place absent\nthe action; (4)\nthe creation of a\nmaterial conflict with a community's existing plans or goals as officially\napproved or adopted; (5)\nthe\nimpairment of the character or quality of important historical, archeological, architectural or aesthetic resources or of existing community or neighborhood\ncharacter; (6)\na major change in\nthe use of either the quantity or type of energy; (7)\nthe creation of a hazard to human health\nor safety. (8)\na substantial change\nin the use, or intensity of use of land or other natural resources or in their\ncapacity to support existing uses except where such a change has been included, referred to, or implicit in a broad statement prepared pursuant to this Part\n(Program EIS). (9)\nthe creation of\na material demand for other actions which would result in one of the above\nconsequences. (10)\nchanges in two\nor more elements of the environment, no one of which is substantial, but when\ntaken together result in a material change in the environment. (b) For the purpose of determining\nwhether an action will cause one of the consequences listed in subdivision (a)\nof this section, the action shall be deemed to include other contemporaneous or\nsubsequent actions (1) which are included in any long-range comprehensive\nintegrated plan of which the action under consideration is a part, (2) which\nare likely to be undertaken as a result thereof or (3) which are dependent\nthereon. The significance of a likely consequence (i.e., whether it is\nmaterial, substantial, large, important, etc.) should be assessed in connection\nwith its setting (i.e., urban or rural), its probability of occurring, its\nduration, its irreversibility, its controlability, its geographic scope and its\nmagnitude (i.e., degree of change of its absolute size). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n2500.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
