The agricultural fairground owner must ensure and confirm in writing to the permit-issuing official that the following actions have been taken with respect to the agricultural fairgound water system, 15 days prior to the opening of the first event for which the water supply is utilized each year: (1)\n\nAll water mains that are not subject to continuous water use shall be adequately flushed and coliform samples shall be collected in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of this section. (2)\n\nAll water mains that are not subject to continuous water use shall be disinfected by: (i) completely filling the main to remove all air pockets, flushing the main to remove particulates, and filling the main with potable water. The potable water shall then be chlorinated by feeding liquid hypochlorite at a constant rate such that the water will not have less than a 25 mg/l free chlorine residual throughout the agricultural fairground water system. After a 24-hour holding period there must be a free chlorine residual of not less than 10 mg/l throughout the agricultural fairground water system; or\n(ii)\nusing a disinfection method the State Commissioner of Health has determined in writing to be of comparable effectiveness. (3)\n\nFree chlorine residual disinfection concentrations shall be measured for the two days immediately following the completion of the main disinfection, as prescribed in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, at representative points in the distribution system, to ensure chlorine residuals of not less than 0.2 mg/l. (4)\n\nAll existing distribution systems shall be surveyed to ensure there are no physical connections between the potable water supply and any nonpotable water supply, and any nonpotable water supply shall be conspicuously labeled as a nonpotable supply. (5)\n\nAny connection to the potable water supply without an air gap shall have at a minimum an anti-siphon valve or vacuum breaker or additional protection sufficient to address the degree of hazard.
