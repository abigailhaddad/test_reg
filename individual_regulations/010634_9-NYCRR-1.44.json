  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1.44 - Executive Order No. 44: Establishment of State comprehensive planning and development regions\n\nState Regulations\nI, Nelson A. Rockefeller, Governor of the State of New\n\nYork, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws of\nthe State of New York, do hereby issue this Executive Order to further the\ncoordination of the comprehensive and functional regional planning activities\nof the State departments and agencies with one another and with those of the\n\nFederal and local governments and of the private sector. In the last decade, New York State has commenced a\ncoordinated effort to develop the State on a balanced regional basis. As part\nof this effort, comprehensive planning and development regions were developed\nfor the State based upon area-wide groupings of counties reflecting their\nphysical, economic and human resource relationships. The design of these regions, which were delineated after\nstudy and consultation with the various State departments and agencies and\nlocal governments, is such as will promote the efficient and effective\naccomplishment of Federal, State and local development programs. There now exists a comprehensive planning agency servicing\neach of these planning and development regions. Moreover, the Federal government, in its efforts to improve\nintergovernmental coordination, has been recently requiring the use, insofar as\npossible, of coterminous boundaries for planning the various federally assisted\ndevelopment programs within the states. Accordingly, the eleven comprehensive planning and\ndevelopment regions as now constituted and represented on the annexed map\n[below], and as such regions may from time to time be modified by the Governor, are hereby declared to be the official comprehensive planning and development\nregions of New York State. Click to\nview image\n\nFurther, I hereby direct the heads of the several State\ndepartments and agencies to adopt and utilize the official comprehensive\nplanning and development regions for all comprehensive and functional planning\nactivities, and to submit a written report, no later than July 1, 1971, to the\n\nDirector of the State Office of Planning Coordination indicating the measures\ntaken to comply with this Order. Where the head of any department or agency\ndeems it not feasible for his department or agency to conform to these official\nregional boundaries for planning purposes, he shall detail in the report the\nreasons for this infeasibility, and shall propose alternative regional\nboundaries which shall adhere to the official boundaries insofar as possible. The Director of the State Office of Planning Coordination may approve the use\nof alternative regional boundaries if he shall determine that such an\nalternative is clearly justified. In addition, I hereby direct the heads of the several State\ndepartments and agencies to review their field services and operations, and\nsubmit a written report to the Governor no later than July 1, 1971, detailing\nthe extent to which it would be desirable and possible to administer these\nservices and operations on the basis of the regions established by this\n\nOrder. Signed: Nelson A. Rockefeller\n\nDated: February 1, 1971\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n1.44\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
