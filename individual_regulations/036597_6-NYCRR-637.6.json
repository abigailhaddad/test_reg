Tit. 6 § 637.6 - Qualifications and primary functions for environmental engineers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An environmental engineer applies the principles and data of engineering and natural and social sciences for the protection and improvement of the environment. The basic qualifications for an environmental engineer in any grade established in this Part shall be graduation with a baccalaureate in engineering from an accredited school, college, university or other institution of learning. (b) Environmental engineer trainee. (1)\n\nPrimary functions. An environmental engineer trainee assists higher ranking engineers in the performance of professional field and office work under close and continuing supervision while participating in an approved training program. (2)\n\nAdditional qualifications. (i) Satisfactory completion of a training program approved by the commissioner; or\n(ii)\none year of satisfactory environmental engineering experience. (c) Assistant environmental engineer. (1)\n\nPrimary functions. Under administrative and technical supervision of higher ranking engineers, an assistant environmental engineer performs environmental engineering activities of ordinary difficulty and responsibility which may include investigating, evaluating and inspecting facilities and premises; making analyses, measurements and calculations relating thereto; interpreting the results of laboratory examinations; assisting in the instruction of staffs of local wastewater treatment plants, incinerator and landfill operations; reviewing plans; participating in the investigation of environmental problems; writing reports and recommendations; and testifying at enforcement proceedings. (2)\n\nQualifications required. (i) One year of satisfactory environmental engineering experience, which includes completion of a training program as an environmental engineer trainee which was approved by the commissioner; or\n(ii)\ntwo years of satisfactory environmental engineering experience. (d) Senior environmental engineer. (1)\n\nPrimary functions. A senior environmental engineer is responsible for planning, directing and administering all environmental programs, or has responsible charge of all engineering functions in an agency having regulatory responsibility for a political subdivision of less than 100,000 population or, under administrative supervision, has responsibility for the same or similar functions for segments of an environmental conservation program in an agency having regulatory responsibility for a political subdivision of 100,000 or greater population. (2)\n\nQualifications required. (i) Possession of a license to practice professional engineering in New York State; and either\n(ii)\none year of satisfactory experience as an assistant environmental engineer in an environmental conservation or health agency, or\n(iii)\nthree years of satisfactory environmental engineering experience. (e) Associate environmental engineer. (1)\n\nPrimary functions. An associate environmental engineer has responsibility for planning, directing and administering all environmental programs or has responsible charge of all engineering functions in an agency having regulatory responsibility for a political subdivision of more than 100,000 but less than 350,000 population, or under administrative supervision has responsibility for the same or similar functions for segments of an environmental conservation program in an agency having regulatory responsibility for a political subdivision of 350,000 or greater population. (2)\n\nQualifications required. (i) Possession of license to practice professional engineering in New York State; and either\n(ii)\none year of satisfactory experience as a senior environmental engineer in an environmental conservation or health agency, or\n(iii)\nfour years of satisfactory environmental engineering experience, of which one year must be in a position equivalent to that of a senior environmental engineer. (f) Principal environmental engineer. (1)\n\nPrimary functions. A principal environmental engineer is responsible for planning, directing and administering all environmental programs or has responsibility for all engineering functions in an agency having regulatory responsibility for a political subdivision of 350,000 or greater population. (2)\n\nQualifications required. (i) Possession of a license to practice professional engineering in New York State; and either\n(ii)\ntwo years of satisfactory experience as an associate environmental engineer in an environmental conservation or health agency, or\n(iii)\nsix years of satisfactory environmental engineering experience, of which two years must be in a position equivalent to that of an associate environmental engineer. (g) Equivalent State titles. As examples of comparable experience for qualification purposes, experience in the following State Department of Health and/or State Department of Environmental Conservation civil service engineering series is considered to be equivalent to the experience in the following sanitary code titles and for the titles in these rules and regulations: (1)\n\nJunior engineer--public health engineer--environmental engineer trainee. (2)\n\nAssistant sanitary engineer--assistant public health engineer--assistant environmental engineer. (3)\n\nSenior sanitary engineer--senior public health engineer--senior environmental engineer. (4)\n\nAssociate sanitary engineer--associate public health engineer--associate environmental engineer--associate air pollution control engineer--associate solid waste control engineer--associate nuclear engineer. (5)\n\nPrincipal sanitary engineer--principal public health engineer--principal environmental engineer--principal air pollution control engineer--principal solid waste control engineer--principal nuclear engineer.
