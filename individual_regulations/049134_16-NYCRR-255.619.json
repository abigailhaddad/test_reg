Tit. 16 § 255.619 - Maximum allowable operating pressure: steel or plastic pipelines\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except\nas provided in subdivision (c) of this section, no person may operate a segment\nof steel or plastic pipeline at a pressure that exceeds the lowest of the\nfollowing: (1)\nthe design pressure of the\nweakest element in the segment, determined in accordance with this\n\nPart; (2)\nthe pressure obtained by\ndividing the pressure to which the segment was tested after construction as\nfollows: (i) for plastic pipe in all\nlocations, the test pressure is divided by a factor of 1.5; (ii)\nfor steel pipe operated at 100 p.s.i. (689 kPa) gauge or more, the test pressure is divided by a factor determined in\naccordance with the following table: Class Location\n\nFactors\n1\nfor segment\n-\nInstalled before Nov. 11, 1970\n\nInstalled on or after Nov. 12, 1970\n\nConverted under §\n255.14\n1\n1.1\n1.5\n1.5\n2\n1.25\n1.5\n1.5\n3\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n4\n1.5\n1.5\n1.5\n1\n\nFor off shore pipeline\nsegments installed, uprated or converted after July 31, 1977, that are not\nlocated on an offshore platform, the factor is 1.25. For pipeline segments\ninstalled, uprated or converted after July 31, 1977, that are located on an\noffshore platform or on a platform in inland navigable waters, including a pipe\nriser, the factor is 1.5. (4)\nthe pressure determined by the operator\nto be the maximum safe pressure after considering and accounting for records of\nmaterial properties, including material properties verified in accordance with\n\nSection 255.607 of this Part, if applicable, and the history of the pipeline\nsegment, including known corrosion and actual operating\npressure. (b) No person\nmay operate a segment to which paragraph (a)(6) of this section is applicable, unless overpressure protective devices are installed on the segment in a manner\nthat will prevent the maximum allowable operating pressure from being exceeded, in accordance with section\n255.195\nof this Part. (c) Notwithstanding the other requirements of\nthis section, an operator may operate a segment of pipeline found to be in\nsatisfactory condition, considering its operating and maintenance history, at\nthe highest actual operating pressure to which the segment was subjected during\nthe five years preceding July 1, 1970, subject to the requirements of section\n255.611\nof this Part. (d) Notwithstanding the limitation of\nparagraph (a)(3) of this section, an operator may maintain a previously\nestablished maximum allowable operating pressure for a cathodically protected\nsteel or plastic pipeline provided that, when the pressure is increased above\nthe highest pressure to which it has been subjected during the last five years, it is leakage surveyed and all leaks found are repaired in accordance with this\n\nPart.
