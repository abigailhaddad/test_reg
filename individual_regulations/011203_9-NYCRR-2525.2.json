  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2525.2 - Evasion\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The legal\nregulated rents and other requirements provided in this Code shall not be\nevaded, either directly or indirectly, in connection with the renting or\nleasing or the transfer of a lease for housing accommodations by requiring the\ntenant to pay, or obligate himself or herself for membership or other fees, or\nby modification of the practices relating to payment of commissions or other\ncharges, or by modification of the services furnished or required to be\nfurnished with the housing accommodations, or otherwise. (b) (1)\n\nUpon the receipt of rent in the form of cash or any instrument other than the\npersonal check of the tenant, it shall be the duty of the owner to provide the\ntenant with a written receipt containing the following: (i) the date; (ii)\nthe amount; (iii)\nthe identity of the premises and period\nfor which paid; and\n(iv)\nthe\nsignature and title of the person receiving the rent. (2)\nA tenant may request in writing that an\nowner provide a receipt for rent paid by personal check. If such request is\nmade, the owner shall provide the tenant with the receipt described in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nThe receipt provided pursuant to this\nsubdivision shall state the name and New York City address of the managing\nagent or designee thereof, as required by section 27-2105 of the Administrative\n\nCode of the City of New York. A failure to comply with the provisions of this\nsubdivision shall constitute an evasionary practice. (4)\n\nSuch request shall, unless otherwise\nspecified by the tenant, remain in effect for the duration of such tenant's\ntenancy. The owner shall maintain a record of all cash receipts for rent for at\nleast three year sunless a longer period is required by other provisions of\nthis Code. (5)\n\nIf a payment of rent\nis personally transmitted to an owner, the receipts for such payment shall be\nissued immediately to a tenant. If a payment of rent is transmitted indirectly\nto an owner, a tenant shall be provided with a receipt within fifteen days of\nsuch rent payment. (6)\n\nIf an owner\nor an agent of an owner authorized to receive rent fails to receive payment for\nrent within five days of the date specified in a lease agreement, such owner\nshall send the tenant, by certified mail, a written notice stating the failure\nto receive such rent payment. The failure of an owner or an agent of the owner\nauthorized to receive rent to provide a tenant with a written notice of the\nnon-payment of rent maybe used as an affirmative defense by such tenant in an\neviction proceeding based on the non-payment of rent.
