  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 11.11 - Budget or levelized payment plans\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. Every utility shall offer\nresidential customers a voluntary budget billing or levelized payment plan for\nthe payment of charges. The plan shall be designed to reduce fluctuations in\ncustomers' bills due to seasonal patterns of consumption. Any such plan shall\nalso be offered to customers who are condominium associations or cooperative\nhousing corporations. (b) Criteria. Unless otherwise authorized by the commission, each such plan shall be based on\nthe customer's recent 12-month experience, adjusted for known changes. If 12\nmonths of billing data are not available for the customer then 12 months of\nbilling data for the premises shall be used. If 12 months of billing data are\nnot available for the premises then the utility shall estimate future\nconsumption over the next 12-month period. Each such plan shall provide that\nbills clearly identify consumption and state the amounts that would be due\nwithout levelized or budget billing; such information need not be supplied on\ninterim bills for customers billed on a bimonthly basis. Each such plan shall\nprovide that bills be subject to regular review for conformity with actual\nbillings. (c) Commission approval. Each such plan shall be filed with the commission and any significant changes\nin the plan shall be submitted to the commission for review before\nimplementation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n11.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
