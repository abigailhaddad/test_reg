  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 830.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe terms, words, or phrases used in this Part shall\nhave the meanings described below: (a) \"Item no.\" In table I, the waters within the Lake Champlain drainage basin are\nlisted for purposes of classification. For ease of reference, each listing in\nthe table has been assigned an \"item number.\"\n(b) \"Waters index number\" as appearing in\ntable I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been assigned to any\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof for the purpose of\nidentification. (1)\n\nThe numbering or index\nsystem used to identify specific waters of New York State was adapted from that\nused by the Department in its biological survey series of reports on the\nwatersheds of the State. The primary waters of a drainage basin, such as rivers\nor large lakes, are usually referred to by name or an abbreviation. Tributaries\nof primary waters are consecutively numbered progressing upstream from the\nmouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively as they are encountered, such\nnumbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of lakes and ponds are\nnumbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or\npond from its outlet or mouth. When isolated lakes and ponds are referenced by\na waters index number, it is merely for convenience of their identification and\nlocation within a drainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their\nbeing tributary to any waters to which no surface connection is shown on the\nreference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was\napplied to the basin under consideration by the Department in its biological\nsurvey of the Lake Champlain watershed and has been closely followed in\nconnection with the identification of the waters with the following exceptions: some of the stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of\nstreams originally shown on older maps employed by the Department at the time\nof its survey but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few\nstreams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the newer maps are\ndesignated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Lake Champlain drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: \"Waters index number\"\n\"Name of waters\"\n\"Explanation\"\nC\nLake Champlain\n\nLake Champlain, a primary waterway. C-15\n\nSaranac River\n\nThe fifteenth tributary entering Lake Champlain\nnumbering from north to south beginning at the Canadian Border at the north and\nproceeding to the Vermont Border at the south. C-15-22\n\nNorth Branch Saranac River\n\nThe twenty-second tributary entering the\n\nSaranac River upstream from its mouth. C-15-22-24\n\nTributary of North Branch Saranac River\n\nThe twenty-fourth tributary entering the North\n\nBranch Saranac River upstream from its mouth. C-15-22-24-P 48\n\nLoon Lake\n\nThe forty-eighth pond, lake, or reservoir\nencountered in the biological survey of the Lake Champlain watershed and\nspecifically located in the drainage basin of C-15-22-24. (c) The abbreviations \"trib.,\" \"tribs.,\"\n\"subtrib.,\" and \"subtribs.\" indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary, and subtributaries, respectively, shall mean any stream, lake, pond, or other\nbody of surface water which flows into any other stream, lake, pond, or other\nbody of surface water. Where no tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water referenced by such waters index number; where\ntributaries or subtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the\nspecifically designated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond, or other\nbody of surface water referenced by such waters index number and all\ntributaries and subtributaries thereof, which are shown on the reference maps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) \"Name\" as appearing in table I shall mean\nthe name, if any, by which the specifically designated waters are generally\nknown and which may appear on the reference maps. In cases of specifically\ndesignated waters which have no name, the named waters to which the unnamed\nwaters are tributary are indicated as far as possible. (e) \"Description\" as appearing in table I\nshall mean a brief indication as to the location of the specifically designated\nwaters. Entries may include designations of segments or sections of waters to\nwhich a particular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may\nalso include any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. Geographic coordinates, when specified, are based on the Universal\n\nTransverse Mercator coordinate system zone 18 north (UTM 18N), North American\n\nDatum of 1983 (NAD83), in meters. All coordinates are expressed as east (E), north (N), and rounded to the nearest ten meters. (f) \"Map ref. no.\" The map reference numbers\nappearing in table I under this heading designate the following maps which have\nbeen reproduced completely or in part in section\n830.10\nof this Part. \"Map ref. no.\"\n\"Name of quadrangle\"\n\"Published by\"\n\"Edition\"\nA-24\n\nChurubusco\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1943\nA-25\n\nMooers\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1943\nA-26\n\nRouses Point\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1943\nB-23\n\nLoon Lake\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1908\nB-24\n\nLyon Mountain\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1913\nB-25\n\nDannemora\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1913\nB-26\n\nPlattsburgh\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1943\nC-22\n\nSt. Regis\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1905\nC-23\n\nSaranac\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1902\nC-24\n\nLake Placid\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1898\nC-25\n\nAusable\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1903\nC-26\n\nWillsboro\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1943\nD-22\n\nLong Lake\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1904\nD-23\n\nSantanoni\nU.S. Army, Corps of Engineers\n1904\nD-24\n\nMt.
