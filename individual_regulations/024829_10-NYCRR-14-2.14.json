Tit. 10 §§ 14-2.14 - Walls and ceilings of food preparation areas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Ceilings are to be made of wood, canvas, or other materials that protect the interior of the establishment from the weather. Walls and ceilings of food preparation areas are to be constructed in a way that prevents the entrance of insects. Screening material used for walls, doors or windows is to be at least 16 mesh to the inch. Doors to food preparation areas are to be solid or screened and are to be self-closing. (b) Counter-service openings shall be provided with tight-fitting solid or screened doors or windows or shall be provided with fans installed and operated to restrict the entrance of flying insects. Counter-service openings are to be kept closed except when in actual use. (c) Where other effective methods of fly control, acceptable to the permit-issuing official are employed, or at a time of the year when there is no insect problem, the screening requirements of subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section will not apply.
