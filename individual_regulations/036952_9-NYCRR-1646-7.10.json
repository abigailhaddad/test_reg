Tit. 9 §§ 1646-7.10 - Schedule of contingent liabilities\n\nState Regulations\n\nContingent liabilities not reflected on a local\nagency's balance sheet will consist mainly of pending or threatened claims, lawsuits or judgments for which no provision has been made inasmuch as some\nuncertainty exists at the balance sheet date as to whether there will ever be\nany legal obligation. Contingent liabilities involving amounts which are or may\nbecome material shall be listed in a schedule of contingent liabilities, to be\nsubmitted with each quarterly financial report, together with the estimated\namounts involved and such information as will explain their nature and\nstatus. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1646-7.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
