(ii)\n\nThe commissioner shall annually\ndetermine an amount of Federal funds which may be used to reimburse school\ndistricts for allowable administrative costs incurred. The commissioner shall\nalso calculate each school district's allocation from this amount, which shall\nbe in the same ratio to this amount as the number of preschool students with\ndisabilities residing in that district and served on December 1st of the most\nrecent year for which satisfactory data are available bears to the total number\nof such students residing in the State on that date.

Each such share shall be in the same ratio to the amount set aside by\nthe commissioner as that school district's actual growth is to the sum of\nactual growths of all such districts in the State. (vii)\n\nAt the close of the school year for\nwhich the administrative funds were advanced as described in subparagraphs (i)\nthrough (vi) of this paragraph, each public school district shall submit, in a\nform prescribed by the commissioner, a statement of the administrative costs\nincurred in connection with this section.
