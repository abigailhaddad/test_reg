  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 617.15 - Actions involving a federal agency\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When a draft and final EIS for an action\nhas been duly prepared under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, an\nagency has no obligation to prepare an additional EIS under this Part, provided\nthat the Federal EIS is sufficient to make findings under section\n617.11\nof this Part. However, except in the case of Type II actions listed in section\n617.5\nof this\n\nPart, no involved agency may undertake, fund or approve the action until the\n\nFederal final EIS has been completed and the involved agency has made the\nfindings prescribed in section\n617.11\nof this Part. (b) Where a finding\nof no significant impact (FNSI) or other written threshold determination that\nthe action will not require a Federal impact statement has been prepared under\nthe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the determination will not\nautomatically constitute compliance with SEQR. In such cases, state and local\nagencies remain responsible for compliance with SEQR. (c) In the case of an action involving a\n\nFederal agency for which either a Federal FNSI or a Federal draft and final EIS\nhas been prepared, except where otherwise required by law, a final decision by\na Federal agency will not be controlling on any state or local agency decision\non the action, but may be considered by the agency.
