Each person who possesses any radiation source shall supply and require the proper use of appropriate, calibrated and operable individual monitoring devices by: (1)\nadults likely to receive, in one year from sources external to the body, a dose in excess of 10 percent of the limits in section\n16.6\n(a)(1)\nof this Part; and\n(2)\nminors and declared pregnant women likely to receive, in one year from sources external to the body, a dose in excess of 10 percent of any of the applicable limits in section\n16.6\n(g) or\n16.6\n(h) of this Part; and\n(3)\nindividuals entering a high or very high radiation area. (b) A person supplying personnel monitoring devices to individuals as required by subdivision (a) of this section shall ensure that the individuals wear such devices as follows: (1)\n\nAn individual monitoring device used for monitoring the dose to the whole body shall be worn at the unshielded location of the whole body likely to receive the highest exposure. (2)\n\nAn individual monitoring device used for monitoring the dose to an embryo/fetus of a declared pregnant woman, pursuant to section\n16.6\n(h)(1)\nof this Part, shall be located at the waist under any protective apron worn by the woman. (3)\n\nAn individual monitoring device used for monitoring the eye dose equivalent shall be located at the neck outside any protective apron worn by the individual, or at an unshielded location closer to the eye. (4)\n\nAn individual monitoring device used for monitoring the dose to the extremities shall be worn on the extremity likely to receive the highest exposure. The device shall be oriented to measure the highest dose to the extremity being monitored. (c) All personnel monitoring devices, except for direct and indirect reading dosimeter and those dosimeters used to measure the dose to any extremity, that require processing to determine the radiation dose and which are supplied pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, or with conditions specified in a license or registration shall be processed and evaluated by a dosimetry processor: (1)\nholding current personnel dosimetry accreditation from the National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program (NVLAP) of the National Institute of Standards and Technology; and\n(2)\napproved in this accreditation process for the type of radiation or radiations included in the NVLAP program that most closely approximate the type of radiation or radiations for which the individual wearing the dosimeter is monitored. (d) Intake of radioactive material. Each licensee shall perform all appropriate measurements of those specified in section\n16.6\n(d)(1)\nof this Part which will enable him/ her to determine the occupational intake of radioactive material by and assess the committed effective dose equivalent to: (1)\nadults likely to receive, in one year, an intake in excess of 10 percent of the applicable ALI in Appendix 16-C, Table 1, Columns 1 and 2, infra; and\n(2)\nminors and declared pregnant women likely to receive, in one year, a committed effective dose equivalent in excess of 0.50 mSv (0.05 rem). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n16.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
