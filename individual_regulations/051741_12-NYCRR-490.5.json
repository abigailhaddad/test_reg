  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 490.5 - Total unemployment (unemployment insurance law, section 522)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Days of rest\nand absence with pay. A claimant who is capable of and available for work is\ntotally unemployed on Sundays, holidays and other days of rest scheduled by his\nemployer, even if an employer-employee relationship exists on such days, provided he does not work on such days and they are not days of paid vacation\nor other paid leave. (b) Termination of employment if dismissal payment is made. An employee's\n\"employment\" by an employer who has discharged him permanently or has laid him\noff for an indefinite period (no date for his return to work having been\nestablished) is terminated after the last day on which he was required to\nreport for work even if he receives payments from the employer in addition to\nremuneration for the specific hours, days, weeks, or other periods during which\nhe performed actual services. This principle applies likewise if such payments\nare made in lieu of paid vacation to which the employee is entitled or in lieu\nof notice. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n490.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
