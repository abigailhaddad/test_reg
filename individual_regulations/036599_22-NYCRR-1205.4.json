  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1205.4 - Statement of client's rights in cooperative business arrangements\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn the furtherance of a cooperative\nbusiness arrangement: (a) prior to the commencement of legal\nrepresentation of a client referred by a nonlegal service provider; or\n(b) prior to the\nreferral of an existing client to a nonlegal service provider; a lawyer shall provide the client with a\nstatement of client's rights. That statement shall include a consent to the\nreferral to be signed by the client and shall contain the following: STATEMENT OF CLIENT'S RIGHTS IN\nCOOPERATIVE BUSINESS ARRANGEMENTS\nYour lawyer is providing you with this\ndocument to explain how your rights may be affected by the referral of your\nparticular matter by your lawyer to a nonlegal service provider, or by the\nreferral of your particular matter by your lawyer to a nonlegal service\nprovider, or by the referral of your particular matter by a nonlegal service\nprovider to your lawyer. To help avoid any misunderstanding between\nyour and your lawyer please read this document carefully. If you have any\nquestions about these rights, do not hesitate to ask your lawyer. Your lawyer has entered into a contractual\nrelationship with a nonlegal professional or professional service firm, in the\nform of a cooperative business arrangement which may include sharing of costs\nand expenses, to provide legal and nonlegal services. Such an arrangement may\nsubstantially affect your rights in a number of respects. Specifically, you are\nadvised: 1. A lawyer's\nclients are guaranteed the independent professional judgment and undivided\nloyalty of the lawyer, uncompromised by conflicts of interest. The lawyer's\nbusiness arrangement with a provider of nonlegal services may not diminish\nthese rights. 2. Confidences and secrets imparted by a client to a lawyer are protected by the\nattorney/client privilege and may not be disclosed by the lawyer as part of a\nreferral to a nonlegal service provider without the separate written consent of\nthe client. 3. The\nprotections afforded to a client by the attorney/client privilege may not carry\nover to dealings between the client and a nonlegal service provider. Information that would be protected as a confidence or secret, if imparted by\nthe client to a lawyer, may not be so protected when disclosed by the client to\na nonlegal service provider. Under some circumstances, the nonlegal service\nprovider may be required by statute or a code of ethics to make disclosure to a\ngovernment agency. 4. Even where a lawyer refers a client\nto a nonlegal service provider for assistance in financial matters, the\nlawyer's obligation to preserve and safeguard client funds in his or her\npossession continues. You have the right to consult with an\nindependent lawyer or other third party before signing this agreement. Client's Consent: I have read the above statement of\n\nClient's Rights in Cooperative Business Arrangements and I consent to the\nreferral of my particular matter in accordance with that Statement. ______________\nClient's signature\n______________\nDate\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
