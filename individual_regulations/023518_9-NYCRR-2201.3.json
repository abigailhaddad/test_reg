(f) The total of (1) the rent increase\npursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, (2) any increases granted between\n\nJanuary 1, 1970 and December 31, 1971, inclusive, pursuant to section\n2202.8, 2202.9 or\n2202.10\nof this Title, and (3) any\nincrease granted on or after August 1, 1970 pursuant to section\n2202.11\nof this Title, shall not\nexceed 15 percent of the 1970 base rent. For the purposes of this subdivision, the\n1970 base rent\nis the maximum rent on July 31, 1970 minus\nthe amount of any increase granted between January 1, 1970 and July 31, 1970, inclusive, pursuant to section\n2202.8, 2202.9 or\n2202.10\nof this Title. This\nsubdivision shall not operate to decrease any maximum rent existing on July 31, 1970. (g) (1)\n\nThe rent increases provided for in this\nsection shall be collectible upon the landlord's filing a report with the\nadministrator as provided in section\n2203.9\nof this Title, subject to\nadjustment, however, by order of the administrator which shall prescribe (i)\nthat any excess rent paid by the tenant be credited to the tenant in full\ncommencing with the rental payment following the date of issuance of such\norder, or (ii) that any rent due landlord by reason of the order shall be paid\nin installments equal to the number of whole months intervening between August\n1, 1970 and the date of issuance of such order.

(2)\n\nThe report shall contain a certified\nstatement by the landlord that there is no legally habitable rent-controlled\nhousing accommodation, in the building containing the accommodation for which\nany rent increase is sought, which has not been rented for a period of six\nmonths or more prior to the filing of such report, or that if there is such a\nhousing accommodation, the reason it has not been rented is that it is being\naltered pursuant to a permit issued by the Department of Buildings no later\nthan three months after the vacancy commenced and that the alteration is of\nsuch a nature that the accommodation must be kept vacant while it is being\nmade, or for such other cause found by the administrator not to be inconsistent\nwith the purpose of the Rent law or these regulations; provided, further, that\nin the case of an alteration, it is commenced within 60 days from the issuance\nof said permit. A copy of the permit and the plans therefor shall accompany the\nreport. No report shall be accepted for filing, and no rent increase provided\nfor in this section shall be collected, in the absence of any such verified\nstatement by the landlord. (h) The rent increases provided for in this\nsection shall not be collectible for the period between April 1, 1971 and\n\nDecember 31, 1971, inclusive, unless the landlord shall have filed with the\nadministrator, on or before March 31, 1971, a certified statement attesting\nthat for every month for which he has received a rent increase pursuant to this\nsection, he has expended on the operation, maintenance and improvements of the\nhousing accommodations from which increases were collected an amount which\nequals the amount expended per month for such purpose averaged over the\npreceding five years, or such lesser period that he has been landlord of such\nproperty, plus 90 percent of all increased rents so collected. If such\ncertified statement is filed after March 31, 1971, such increases shall be\ncollectible beginning on the first day of the month following the date of such\nfiling. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
