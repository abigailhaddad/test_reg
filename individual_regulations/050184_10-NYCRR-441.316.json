  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 441.316 - Straight-line method of depreciation\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis method of allocating depreciation is a function of\nthe passage of time and recognizes equal periodic charges over the useful life\nof the asset. The depreciation charge calculated by the straight-line method is\nnot affected by asset productivity, efficiency, or degree of use. The periodic\ncharge is computed by relating the cost of the asset, less any salvage, to the\nuseful life of the asset. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n441.316\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
