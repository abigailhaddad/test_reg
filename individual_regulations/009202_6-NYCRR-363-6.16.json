  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.16 - Final cover - composite barrier layer\n\nState Regulations\n(a) After a landfill ceases to accept waste\nas specified in section\n363-9.3\nof this Part, a final cover\nconsisting of a composite barrier must be installed. The project engineer must\nconsider the projected service life of the final cover system, settlement, erosion, and seepage forces in the overall stability of the final cover system. (1)\n\nThe composite barrier layer must consist\nof a GCL overlain by a separate geomembrane, unless the department approves an\nalternative geosynthetic barrier designed to serve as the uppermost layer of\nthe final cover system. (i) GCL. The GCL must\nbe specified by the project engineer upon demonstrating both physical and\nchemical stability of the bentonite used in the GCL. The GCL component of the\ncomposite cover must meet the requirements of section\n363-6.7\n(b)(1) and\n(c) of this Subpart. (a) On slopes equal to or greater than 25\npercent and for side slope terraces on those slopes, the GCL component of the\ncomposite barrier may be eliminated. (ii)\n\nGeomembrane barrier layer of composite\ncover. The barrier layer must be constructed to limit precipitation migration\ninto the landfill. (a) The geomembrane\nmaterial must be chemically and physically resistant to materials it contacts, and be able to accommodate the expected forces and stresses such as those\ncaused by settlement of waste. (b) A geomembrane comprised of linear low-density polyethylene polymer must have a\nnominal thickness of 40 mils or thicker. A geomembrane comprised of HDPE must\nhave a nominal thickness of 60 mils or thicker. (b) Construction\nrequirements. (1)\nGCL. GCLs must be\nconstructed in accordance with section\n363-6.7\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart. (2)\n\nGeomembrane\nbarrier layer. Geomembrane barrier layers must be constructed in accordance\nwith the requirements of section\n363-6.8\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart with the following exceptions: (i) the geomembrane must be placed between a 4 percent minimum slope and a 33\npercent maximum slope; and\n(ii)\nwhere GCL is used, the geomembrane must be placed in direct and uniform contact\nwith the underlying GCL. (c) Certification requirements. Certification for the installation of a composite barrier\nlayer must be conducted in accordance with the same conditions found in section\n363-6.8\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, except for the electrical resistivity testing provisions of section\n363-6.8\n(c)(3)(vii)\nof this Subpart.
