  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 357.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nAmendments to section\n209-a\nof\nthe State Finance Law provide for differing rules for different groups of State\nemployees with respect to eligibility for workers' compensation supplements. Under the law, certain employees will not be entitled to receive workers'\ncompensation supplements, which are paid on the regular employee payroll, while\nother groups will be entitled to receive such supplements for specified periods\nof time. Certain employees who are not receiving such supplements are\nnonetheless entitled to retirement service credit for certain periods during\nwhich they are out of service and receiving workers' compensation benefits, and\nmust pay any required member contributions for such credit. Section 209-a\nfurther provides that the Comptroller must promulgate regulations with respect\nto procedures for payment of member contributions by employees who are out of\nservice and receiving workers' compensation benefits, and this Part is hereby\npromulgated to provide such procedures. Under the statutory scheme discussed\nabove, it remains practicable for the retirement systems to collect required\nmember contributions from employers on behalf of employees who receive\nsupplements, in the form of payroll deductions. However, it is not possible for\nthe retirement system to receive contributions in the form of payroll\ndeductions with respect to employees who do not receive supplements while out\non workers' compensation leave. Furthermore, it would be unduly financially\nburdensome for employees who do not receive supplements to be required to make\nmember contributions before they return to paid service. Accordingly, this Part\nestablishes different procedures for collection of member contributions with\nrespect to employees who do and do not receive workers' compensation\nsupplements from their employers while out of service and receiving workers'\ncompensation benefits. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n357.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
