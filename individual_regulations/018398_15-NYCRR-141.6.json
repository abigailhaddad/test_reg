Sponsoring agencies shall allow and\ncooperate with the department's, or the department's designee's supervision and\nmonitoring of motor vehicle accident prevention courses conducted for point and\ninsurance reduction benefits. Sponsors must allow the department or its\ndesignee to make periodic unscheduled inspections of all sponsor facilities and\nrecords related to the delivery and administration of the ADM course. (a) The department, the department's third\nparty monitor, if one is selected, and the sponsors shall monitor the following\nareas: (1)\n\nThe parameters of program delivery\nand adherence to a sponsoring agency's approved course, to timeframes and\ninternal controls and other measures to ensure that the participant receives a\ncomplete and effective course in full compliance with all applicable laws and\nregulations. (2)\n\nSponsoring\nagencies are responsible for policing their own program, in addition to any\nmonitoring conducted by the department or a third party monitor selected by the\ndepartment. Sponsors shall implement sufficient controls to ensure that the\napproved ADM course, including any timeframes, testing, identity and\nparticiaption validation techniques, as well as customer service and support\nfunctions, remain accurate and functional at all times. System failures, unapproved changes, or absence of internal controls may result in suspension of\nthe sponsor's ADM course. (b) If the department is unable to engage a\nthird party monitor, the sponsoring agencies shall procure an independent third\nparty monitor to ensure program integrity at their own expense. The department\nwill notify the sponsors when they will be required to procure a monitor or\nwhen a department monitor has been secured. (1)\nA third party monitoring contract may\ninclude, but not be limited to the following types of oversight, as determined\nby the commissioner: (i) third party monitor\nvisits the sponsor locations on an annual basis to review compliance with DMV\ncourse requirements; (ii)\nsponsors\nwill give the third party access to information consistent with that provided\nto DMV; (iii)\nthird party monitor\ncompletes each course offering twice per quarter so as to verify all\nrequirements are being met; (iv)\nthird party monitor receives regular data transmission according to a defined\nrecord format of student reporting requirements for ADM. The monitor will\nanalyze data for trends and patterns of abuse; (v) at least two onsite audits of the\nsponsor's data hosting/reporting process, policies and implementation, during\nthe first and third year of the pilot to ensure data collected, stored and\nreported is consistent with what the sponsor received; and\n(vi)\nduring the onsite audit, third party\nmonitors will review sponsor's security of motorist personal information to\nensure adherence to security policies defined in Appendix A (section\n141.14\nof this Part). (c) In the event that a\ncourse is monitored and found to be deficient, a review of data transmission is\nfound to be suspect, or the review of the sponsor's hosting/reporting or\nsecurity process appears deficient, a report of such deficiencies shall be\nreported in writing to both the department and sponsor within 24 hours of\nidentification. When notified of a deficiency, sponsors must investigate, and\nwhere a deficiency is confirmed, provide the DMV with a remediation plan within\n10 business days. The sponsor shall have 30 calendar days to correct the\ndeficiency. (d) DMV may\nperiodically audit any and all sponsor records and third party monitor records\nrelated to the ADM course. (e) DMV\nmay, in the discretion of the commissioner, approve all third party monitors, including those procured by the sponsor. Monitors shall cooperate with the\ndepartment's supervision and monitoring of ADM courses and shall allow the\ndepartment access to all records related to such courses. DMV shall have the\nability to contact sponsor's third party monitors directly, without prior\napproval of the sponsor. (f) DMV\nreserves the right to review and approve the use of a third party database\ninformation for the purpose of validating student identity, including any\ncontracts, agreements, security protocols and policies, and may consult the\nthird party credit bureau or government data provider without permission from\nthe sponsor.
