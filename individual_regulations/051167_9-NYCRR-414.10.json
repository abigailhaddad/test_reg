  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 414.10 - Supplemental relocation payments, loss of favorable mortgage financing, incidental expenses\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to other payments and benefits authorized by\n\nState Law, individuals and families displaced from dwellings on real property\nacquired by the department, who were in occupancy on or after July 1, 1971, are\nentitled to supplemental relocation payments, payment for loss of favorable\nmortgage financing and incidental expenses in accordance with the following\ncriteria and eligibility standards. (a) General requirements to receive\nreplacement housing payments. (1)\n\nIn addition\nto the occupancy requirements as specifically enumerated herein, a displaced\nperson is otherwise eligible for the appropriate payments when he relocates and\noccupies a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling within one year, beginning on the\nlater of the following dates: the date on which he receives final payment from\nthe State for legal damages directly connected with the acquisition of his\ndwelling unit; or the date required to move from the dwelling acquired; or the\ndate on which he actually moves from the dwelling acquired, if in fact this\nlatter date is earlier than the date required to move. The date required to\nmove is here defined and elsewhere in this section as that date specified in\nwriting by the State, by which the property must be vacated. (2)\n\nApplication for payments under this\nsection shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the commission. The\napplication must be filed no later than six months after the expiration of the\none-year period specified immediately above, except that in cases litigated in\nthe Court of Claims, the six-month period shall start from the date of final\njudgment of that court. (3)\n\nIf two\nor more eligible families occupy the same single family dwelling unit, each\nfamily is eligible for a replacement housing payment if they relocate to\nseparate dwelling units. (4)\n\nIf two\nor more eligible individuals with no identifiable head of household occupy the\nsame single family dwelling unit, they are considered as one \"family\" for\nreplacement housing payment purposes. When all individuals do not relocate to\ndecent, safe and sanitary housing, the department shall determine and pay those\nindividuals who do relocate into decent, safe and sanitary housing a prorata\nshare of the amount that would have been received if all of the individuals had\nrelocated together. (b) Supplemental payments; owner-occupants over 180 days who repurchase. (1)\nA displaced owner-occupant of a dwelling\nmay receive additional payments, the combined total of which may not exceed\n$15,000, for the additional cost necessary to purchase replacement housing; to\ncompensate the owner for the loss of favorable financing on his existing\nmortgage in the financing of replacement housing; and to reimburse the owner\nfor incidental expenses incident to the purchase of replacement housing when\nsuch costs are incurred as specified herein. (2)\n\nThe owner-occupant is eligible for such\npayments when: (i) he is in occupancy at the\ninitiation of negotiations for the acquisition of the real property, in whole\nor in part; or\n(ii)\nhe is in\noccupancy at the time he is given a written notice by the State that it is\ntheir intent to acquire the property by a given date; and\n(iii)\nsuch occupancy has been for at least\n180 consecutive days immediately prior to the date of vacation or initiation of\nnegotiations whichever is earlier; and\n(iv)\nhe purchases and occupies a decent, safe\nand sanitary dwelling within the time period specified in paragraph\n(a)(1). (3)\n\nThe\nreplacement housing payment is the amount, if any, which when added to the\namount for which the State acquired his dwelling, equals the actual cost which\nthe owner is required to pay for a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling, or the\namount determined by the department as necessary to purchase a comparable\ndwelling, whichever is less. The State's determination of the amount necessary\nto purchase a comparable dwelling may be made on the basis of either of the two\nfollowing methods: (i) The State may\nestablish a schedule of probable selling prices of comparable dwellings in the\nvarious types of dwellings being acquired. Such schedule may be prepared from\nan analysis of the current probable selling prices of dwellings available on\nthe market. (ii)\n\nThe State may\ndetermine the probable selling price of a comparable dwelling by analyzing\nthose selected comparable dwellings available for sale which are most nearly\ncomparable to the property being acquired by the State. All calculations or supplemental relocation payments are\nto be predicated on the basis of the probable selling price of the available\ncomparable housing, not the asking prices. (4)\n\nAn owner-occupant desiring to retain his\nacquired dwelling may be paid a replacement housing payment according to the\nfollowing computations: (i) If the dwelling\nto be moved is decent, safe and sanitary, the payment shall be the amount by\nwhich the cost to relocate the dwelling exceeds the acquisition price of the\ndwelling. The costs to relocate may include the reasonable costs of acquiring\nthe dwelling, acquiring a new site and other expenses incident to retaining, moving the dwelling and restoring it to a condition comparable to that before\nthe move. (ii)\n\nIf the dwelling to\nbe moved is not decent, safe and sanitary, the payment shall be computed as\nabove except that the costs to cure the decent, safe and sanitary deficiencies\nshall be included in the costs to relocate. (iii)\n\nThe payments computed under (i) or (ii)\nabove may not exceed the amount which the owner would have obtained had he\npurchased a replacement dwelling and his payment computed as per paragraph\n(b)(3) above. (c) Owner-occupant over 180 days who rents\nreplacement housing. An owner-occupant eligible for a replacement housing\npayment under subdivision (b) above who elects to rent a replacement dwelling\nis eligible for a rental replacement housing payment not to exceed $4,000. The\npayment shall be computed and disbursed according to the following criteria: (1)\n\nThe payment shall be determined by\nsubtracting from the amount necessary to rent a comparable dwelling for the\nnext four years, 48 times the economic rental of the dwelling unit occupied as\ncomputed by the State. (2)\n\nIn cases\nwhere the economic rental of the acquired dwelling exceeds 25 percent of the\nowner's gross monthly income and he elects to relocate into public subsidized\nrental housing, the computation of benefits will be in accordance with\nsubdivision (c)(3). (3)\n\nThe State\nmay determine the rental rates of comparable housing by a schedule or an\nindividual analysis of comparable available rentals. (4)\n\nThe payment under this section may not\nexceed the maximum amount the owner would have received had he elected to\nrepurchase a dwelling unit under the provisions of subdivision (b)\nabove. (d) Owner-occupant; less than 180 days, but more than 90 days who purchases. A\ndisplaced owner-occupant otherwise eligible under subdivision (b) except that\nhe has owned and occupied the dwelling for less than 180 days but more than 90\ndays may receive an amount, not to exceed $4,000, to enable him to make a down\npayment on the purchase of a replacement dwelling and reimbursement for actual\nexpenses incident to such purchase; or for additional costs to relocate his\nretained dwelling in accordance with the following regulations: (1)\n\nThe amount of the down payment shall be\ndetermined by the State as the amount required as a down payment on a\ncomparable dwelling if such purchase was financed with a conventional\nloan. (2)\n\nThe expenses incident to\nthe purchase of replacement housing as described in subdivision (j)\nsucceeding. (3)\n\nUpon purchase and\noccupancy of a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling by the relocatee within the\ntime limits specified in paragraph (a)(1), the relocatee may be reimbursed: (i) the full amount of the down payment\ndetermined in paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the eligible incidental\nexpenses if such total amount does not exceed $2,000; or, if more than\n$2,000; (ii)\n$2,000 plus 50 percent\nof the amount in excess of $2,000 providing the relocatee contributes 50\npercent of the amount in excess of $2,000. (4)\n\nThe full amount of the down payment must\nbe applied to the purchase price of the replacement property and any down\npayment and incidental costs claimed must be shown in the closing statement. To\nprocess for payment, the State must be furnished a copy of the closing\nstatement. If the owner elects to retain his dwelling, the\nreplacement housing payment will be determined in accordance with paragraph\n(b)(4), except that such payment shall not exceed $4,000. If the owner first\nelects to rent a replacement property, but later decides to apply for a down\npayment on a purchase of a replacement property, any payments made under the\nrental provisions are to be deducted from the payments authorized under this\nparagraph. (e) Owner-occupant; less than 180 days, but more than 90 days who rents. An owner-\noccupant otherwise eligible under subdivision (b) except that he has owned and\noccupied the dwelling for less than 180 days but more than 90 days and elects\nto rent a replacement dwelling, is eligible for a rental housing payment not to\nexceed $4,000. The specific payment will be determined in accordance with the\nprovisions of paragraphs (c)(1), (2) and (3). (f) Tenant-occupant; over 90 days, renting\nreplacement housing. (1)\nA displaced tenant is\neligible for a rental replacement housing payment, not to exceed $4,000, when: (i) he is in occupancy at the beginning of\nnegotiations for the acquisition of the real property; or\n(ii)\nhe is in occupancy at the time he is\ngiven a written notice by the State that it is their intent to acquire the\nproperty by a given date; and\n(iii)\nsuch occupancy has been for at least 90 consecutive days immediately prior to\nthe date of vacation or initiation of negotiations, whichever is earlier; and\n(iv)\nhe rented and occupied a\ndecent, safe and sanitary dwelling within the time period specified in\nparagraph (a)(1). (2)\n\nThe payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be determined by subtracting from the\namount necessary to rent a comparable dwelling for the next four years, the\nfollowing amount: (i) 48 times the average\nmonthly rental paid by the relocated individual or family during the last three\nmonths; or\n(ii)\nif such average\nmonthly rental is not reasonably equal to market rentals for similar dwellings, the economic rent as established by the State shall be used; (iii)\nthe \"rent being paid\" shall include any\nrent supplements supplied by others except when, by law, such supplement is to\nbe discontinued upon vacation of the property. (3)\n\nWhen the average monthly rental being\npaid by the relocatee, not including supplemental rent by public agencies, exceeds 25 percent of the monthly gross income of such individual or family, the payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be determined by subtracting 12 times\nthe average monthly income of the relocatee from: (i) 48 times the monthly rental determined by\nthe State as necessary to rent a private comparable dwelling if the relocatee\nmoves into private housing; or\n(ii)\nif the relocatee moves into public subsidized housing, the lesser of: (a) 48 times the monthly rental determined by\nthe State as necessary to rent a private comparable dwelling; or\n(b) 48 times the monthly rental the relocatee\nis required to pay if he relocates in the subsidized housing. (4)\n\nThe State may\ndetermine the rental rates of comparable housing by a schedule or an individual\nanalysis of comparable rentals. (g) Tenant-occupant; over 90 days; down\npayment for purchase. A tenant-occupant eligible for a rental replacement\npayment under subdivision (f) who elects to purchase a replacement dwelling is\neligible to receive an amount, not to exceed $4,000, to enable him to make a\ndown payment on the purchase of a replacement dwelling, including the\nincidental expenses incident to such purchase. The payment will be computed in\naccordance with the provisions of subdivision (d). (h) Sleeping room tenant; over 90 days. A\ndisplaced tenant of a sleeping room who is eligible for a replacement housing\npayment under subdivision (f) receives an amount, not to exceed $4,000, as a\nrental replacement housing payment or to enable him to make a down payment on a\nreplacement dwelling in accordance with the following regulations: (1)\n\nFor rental replacement housing, the\npayment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be determined by subtracting from the\namount necessary to rent a comparable sleeping room for the next four years, the following amount: (i) 48 times the\naverage monthly rental paid by the displaced tenant during the last three\nmonths; or\n(ii)\nif such average\nmonthly rental is not reasonably equal to market rentals for similar sleeping\nrooms, the economic rent as established by the State. (2)\n\nThe State may determine the rental rates\nof comparable housing by a schedule or an individual analysis of comparable\navailable rentals. (3)\n\nThe down\npayment amount, including the expenses incident to purchase of the replacement\ndwelling, are to be computed in accordance with the provisions of subdivision\n(d). (i) Increased\ninterest payments; owner-occupant over 180 days, who purchases. (1)\n\nAn owner-occupant, otherwise eligible\nunder subdivision (b), is entitled to a payment for the loss of favorable\nfinancing on his existing mortgage in the financing of replacement housing, providing such payment falls within the $15,000 limit established in\nsubdivision (b), and further providing that the following conditions are met: (i) the dwelling acquired was encumbered by a\nbona fide mortgage which was a valid lien on such dwelling for not less than\n180 days prior to the established eligibility date as specified in subdivision\n(b); and\n(ii)\nthe mortgage on the\nreplacement dwelling bears a higher rate of interest than the mortgage interest\nrate on the acquired dwelling. (2)\n\nThe increased interest payment will be\nbased on and limited to the lesser of the following amounts: (i) the present worth of the right to receive\nthe monthly difference in mortgage payments on the existing mortgage using the\nold and new interest rates; or\n(ii)\nthe present worth of the right to receive the monthly difference in mortgage\npayments on the new mortgage using the old and new interest rates. (3)\n\nPayment computation. The\namount of increased interest payment will be computed in accordance with the\nfollowing procedures: (i) The monthly\nprincipal and interest payment differences caused by the change in interest\nrates is computed for both the existing mortgage and new mortgage for their\nrespective remaining terms and amounts. The old and new interest rates are used\nin each case. (ii)\n\nThe present\nworth of the monthly interest difference found in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph is computed for each mortgage by discounting the annual difference\n(the sum of the monthly difference for one year) at the savings deposit\ninterest rate for the remaining term of each mortgage. The lesser of the\namounts so derived is the increased interest payment. (4)\n(i) Interest rate of replacement dwelling mortgage. The interest rate on the\nmortgage for the replacement dwelling to be used in the computation shall be\nthe actual rate but may not exceed the prevailing interest rate currently\ncharged by mortgage lending institutions in the vicinity. (ii)\n\nWhen the lending agency imposes debt\nservice charges as an incident to the extension of credit, and such charges are\nnormal to the market, the annual percentage rate shown in the truth in lending\nstatement shall be used in lieu of the mortgage interest rate in computing the\nmonthly principal and interest payments. (5)\n\nDiscount rate. The discount rate shall be\nthe prevailing rate of interest paid on passbook savings account deposits by\ncommercial banks in the general area in which the replacement dwelling is\nlocated. (6)\n\nTo whom payment made. The payment described in this paragraph may be made directly to the relocated\nindividual or family, or upon written instruction from the relocated individual\nor family, directly to the mortgagee of the replacement dwelling. (7)\n(i) Partial acquisition. Where the dwelling is located on a tract normal for\nresidential use in the area, the interest payment shall be reduced to the\npercentage ratio that the acquisition price bears to the before value; except, the reduction shall not apply when the mortgagee requires the entire mortgage\nbalance to be paid because of the acquisition, and it is necessary to\nrefinance. (ii)\n\nWhere a dwelling is\nlocated on a tract larger than normal for residential use in the area, the\ninterest payment shall be reduced to the percentage ratio that the value of the\nresidential portion bears to the before value. This reduction shall apply\nwhether or not it is required that the entire mortgage balance be\npaid. (8)\n\nMulti-use\nproperties. The interest payment on multi-use properties shall be reduced to\nthe percentage ratio that the residential value of the multi-use property bears\nto the before value. (9)\n\nOther\nhighest and best use. If a dwelling is located on a tract where the fair market\nvalue is established on a higher and better than residential use, and if the\nmortgage is based on residential value, the interest payment shall be computed\nas provided above. If the mortgage is obviously based on the higher use, however, the interest payment shall be reduced to the percentage ratio that the\nestimated residential value of the parcel bears to the before value. (j) Incidental expenses. (1)\n\nAn otherwise eligible owner-occupant or\ntenant-occupant who purchases a replacement dwelling, is entitled to a payment\nfor the incidental expenses incident to the purchase of the replacement\ndwelling, providing such payment falls within the $15,000 and $4,000 limits as\notherwise established in this section. The following expenses, insofar as they\ndo not constitute prepaid expenses, are eligible for reimbursement on an actual\ncost basis: (i) Legal, closing and related\ncosts including title search, preparing conveyance contracts, notary fees, surveys, preparing drawings or plats, and charges paid incident to\nrecordation: (ii)\nlenders, FHA or\nVA appraisal fees; (iii)\nFHA or VA\napplication fee; (iv)\ncertification\nof structural soundness; (v) credit\nreport; (vi)\nowner's title policy\nor abstract of title; (vii)\nescrow\nagent's fee; (viii)\n\nState revenue\nstamps; (ix)\nsales or transfer\ntaxes. (2)\n\nNo fee, cost, charge or expense is reimbursable as an incidental expense which is part of the\ndebt service, or finance, charge under the Federal Truth in Lending\n\nAct. (3)\n\nReimbursement for these\neligible incidental expenses shall be contingent upon showing the actual\nexpense and shall be accompanied by a copy of the closing statement for the\nreplacement dwelling. (k) Mobile homes; replacement housing\npayments; general provisions. (1)\nA mobile\nhome is considered to be decedent, safe and sanitary if it meets the defined\nstandards in this Part. (2)\n\nWhere\nthe department determines that a sufficient portion of a mobile home park is\ntaken to justify the operator of such park to move his business or go out of\nbusiness and the operator does in fact move or go out of business, the owners\nand occupants of the mobile home dwellings not within the actual taking but who\nare forced to move are eligible to receive the same payments as though their\ndwellings were within the actual taking. (3)\n\nWhen a comparable home dwelling is not\navailable, the supplemental relocation payment is to be calculated on the basis\nof the next higher type dwelling that is available and meets the applicable\nrequirements and standards; i.e., a higher type mobile home or a conventional\ndwelling. (l) Mobile\nhomes; owner-occupants over 180 days. A displaced owner of a mobile home who\nhas occupied, for at least 180 days, the mobile home on the site from which he\nis being displaced and is otherwise eligible under the provisions of paragraph\n(b)(2), is eligible for payments, the total of which may not exceed $15,000, for the additional costs necessary to purchase replacement housing under the\nfollowing circumstances: (1)\n\nWhen\nowner-occupant owns both mobile home and site, the replacement housing payment\nwill be the amount, if any, when added to the amount for which the State\nacquired his mobile home and site equals the lesser of: (i) the amount the owner is required to pay\nfor a decent, safe and sanitary conventional dwelling or a decent, safe and\nsanitary replacement mobile home and site; or\n(ii)\nthe amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to purchase a comparable mobile home and site. If the owner-occupant decides to rent, the rental\nreplacement payment shall be the difference between the State's determination\nof the amount necessary to rent a comparable mobile home and site for a period\nof four years and 48 times the economic rent of the existing mobile home and\nsite. The calculated rental replacement payment may not exceed the amount\ndetermined by the State in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, or\n$4,000, whichever is lesser. (2)\n\nOwner-occupant acquisition of site only. Upon acquisition of the site, and the mobile home is required to be moved, the\nreplacement housing payment will be determined as follows: the amount, if any, when added to the amount for which the State acquired his mobile home site, equals the lesser of: (i) the amount the\nowner is required to pay for a comparable home site; or\n(ii)\nthe amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to purchase a comparable mobile home site. If the owner elects to rent, the rental replacement\npayment shall be the difference in the amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to rent a comparable mobile home site for a period of four years and\n48 times the economic rent of the site acquired. The calculated rental\nreplacement payment may not exceed the amount determined by the State in\nsubparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph, or $4,000, whichever is lesser. (3)\n\nWhen owner-occupant\nowns mobile home; rents site. The replacement housing payment will be the\namount, if any, when added to the amount for which the State acquired his\nmobile home, equals the lesser of: (i) the\namount the owner is required to pay for a replacement dwelling or\n(ii)\nthe amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to purchase a comparable mobile home, plus the difference in the\namount determined by the State as necessary to rent a comparable mobile home\nsite for a period of four years and 48 times the rent being paid on the site\nacquired. If the owner elects to rent a replacement mobile home. the rental replacement housing payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be the\ndifference in the amount determined by the State as necessary to rent a\ncomparable mobile home and site for four years and 48 times the economic rent\nof the mobile home plus the actual rent of the site acquired. (4)\n\nIn addition to the replacement\nhousing payments specified above the owner-occupant is entitled to a payment to\ncompensate him for the loss of favorable financing on his existing mortgage in\nthe financing of replacement housing and payment for incidental expenses\nincident to the purchase of replacement housing. These payments will be\ncalculated and paid in accordance with subdivisions (i) and (j) of this\nsection. (m) Mobile\nhomes; owner-occupants less than 180 days, but more than 90 days. A displaced\nowner of a mobile home who has occupied, for less than 180 days but more than\n90 days, the mobile home on the site from which he is displaced and who is\notherwise eligible under the provisions of paragraph (b)(2), is eligible for an\namount, not to exceed $4,000, to enable him to make a down payment on the\npurchase of replacement housing and to reimburse him for the actual expenses\nincident thereto in accordance with the following provisions: (1)\n\nOwner-occupant owning both mobile home\nand site. If the owner purchases a replacement dwelling, the replacement\nhousing payment will be determined in accordance with the heretofore defined\nprovisions relating to down payment calculations, except that the amount of the\ndown payment shall be determined by the State as the amount required on the\npurchase of a comparable mobile home and site. If the owner-occupant elects to\nrent, the rental replacement payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be the\ndifference in the amount determined by the State as necessary to rent a\ncomparable mobile home and site for a period of four years and 48 times the\neconomic rental of the mobile home and site. (2)\n\nOwner-occupant; acquisition of site only. If the owner purchases convention housing or a site to which the mobile home is\nmoved, the replacement housing payment will be in an amount determined in\naccordance with the provisions relating to down payment calculations except\nthat the amount of the down payment shall be determined by the State as the\namount required as a down payment on the purchases of a comparable site. If the\nowner-occupant elects to rent, the rental replacement payment, not to exceed\n$4,000, shall be the difference in the amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to rent a comparable site for four years and 48 times the economic\nrent of the site acquired. (3)\n\nOwner-occupant owns mobile home; rents site. If the owner purchases replacement\nhousing, the replacement housing payment, not to exceed $4,000, will be: (i) an amount determined in accordance with\nthe provisions relating to down payment calculations, except that the amount of\nthe down payment shall be determined by the State as the amount required as a\ndown payment on the purchase of a comparable mobile home, plus\n(ii)\nthe difference in the amount determined\nby the State as necessary to rent a comparable mobile home site for four years\nand 48 times the rent being paid on the site acquired. If the owner elects to rent, the rental replacement\npayment shall be the difference in the amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to rent a comparable mobile home and site for four years and 48 times\nthe economic rent of the mobile home and the actual rent of the site\nacquired. (n) Mobile homes; tenants over 90 days. A\ndisplaced tenant of a mobile home who has occupied for at least 90 days the\nmobile home on the site from which he has been displaced and is otherwise\neligible under the provisions of paragraph (f)(1), is eligible for a\nreplacement housing payment, not to exceed $4,000. (1)\nto enable him to make a down payment on\nthe purchase of a replacement dwelling and to reimburse him for the expenses\nincident to such purchase; or\n(2)\nif he elects to rent, payment shall be the difference in the amount determined\nby the State as necessary to rent a comparable mobile home and site for four\nyears and 48 times the actual rent being paid for the mobile home and site\nacquired. (o) Supplemental replacement housing payments; miscellaneous provisions. (1)\n\nInspection of replacement dwelling. In\norder to be eligible for and receive any supplemental relocation payments, the\n\nState must inspect the replacement dwelling and determine that it meets the\ndecent, safe and sanitary standards as defined in section\n414.2\nof this Part. In any application for payment, the individual or family must indicate that, to\nthe best of their knowledge and belief, the replacement dwelling meets the\ndefined standards for decent, safe and sanitary housing. (2)\n\nAdvanced replacement housing payments in\nlitigated cases. An advance replacement housing payment can be authorized and\npaid to a property owner if the determination of the State's acquisition price\nwill be delayed pending the outcome of a trial in the Court of Claims. A\nprovisional replacement housing payment may be calculated by deeming the\n\nState's maximum offer for the property as the acquisition price. Payment of\nsuch amount may be made upon the owner-occupant's agreement that: (i) upon final judgment of the Court of\n\nClaims the replacement housing payment will be recomputed using the acquisition\nprice determined by the court as compared to the actual price paid or the\namount determined by the State necessary to acquire a comparable decent, safe\nand sanitary dwelling; (ii)\nif the\namount awarded by the court as the fair market value of the property acquired\nplus the amount of the recomputed replacement housing payment exceeds the price\npaid for, or the State's determined cost of a comparable dwelling, the owner\nwill refund to the State from the judgment amount an amount equal to the\nexcess. In no event, however, shall he be required to refund more than the\namount of the replacement housing payment advanced; and\n(iii)\nif the property owner does not agree to\nsuch adjustment, the replacement housing payment shall be deferred until the\ncase is finally adjudicated and computed on the basis of the final\ndetermination, using the award as the acquisition price. (3)\n\nOwnership of replacement dwelling prior\nto displacement. Any person who has obtained legal ownership of a replacement\ndwelling any time after the initiation of negotiations on the project and\noccupies the replacement dwelling after being displaced but within the time\nlimit specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, is eligible for a\nreplacement housing payment if the replacement dwelling meets decent, safe and\nsanitary standards. (4)\n\nPartial\ntaking situations. (i) Where a dwelling is\nlocated on a tract normal for residential use in the area, the maximum\nreplacement housing payment shall be determined by subtracting the \"before\nvalue\" of the property from the estimated selling price of a comparable\ndwelling on a lot typical for the area. (ii)\n\nWhere a dwelling is located on a tract\nlarger than normal for residential use in the area, the maximum replacement\nhousing payment shall be determined by estimating the value of the dwelling at\nthe present location on a home site typical in size for the area and deducting\nthis amount from the selling price of a comparable dwelling on a site typical\nfor the area. (5)\n\nDwelling on land with higher and better use. Where a dwelling is located on a\ntract where the fair market value is established on a higher and better than\nresidential use, the maximum replacement housing payment shall be determined by\nestimating the value of the dwelling at the present location on a home site\ntypical for the area and zoned for residential use and deducting this amount\nfrom the selling price of a comparable dwelling on a typical residential home\nsite for the area. (6)\n\nJoint\nresidential and business use. Where displaced individuals or families occupy\nliving quarters on the same premises as a displaced business, farm or nonprofit\norganization, such individuals or families are separate displaced persons for\npurposes of determining entitlement to relocation payments. (7)\n\nPayments on assignments. Payments\ndescribed herein may be made, upon written instructions and assignment from the\ndisplaced person, directly to a lessor for rent or to a seller for application\non a payment for a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling. (8)\n\nOwner-occupant; prohibitions on double\npayments. If an owner-occupant eligible for maximum $15,000 payment elects\ninitially not to repurchase a replacement dwelling, but rather to claim\nbenefits on the four year rent differential basis, he cannot receive double\npayment in excess of $15,000 if he later decides (within the allowable period)\nto purchase a replacement house. The amount of any payment made on the rent\ndifferential basis is to be deducted from the calculated differential necessary\nto purchase a replacement dwelling. (9)\n\nAll rental replacement housing payments\nin excess of $500 will be made in four equal installments on an annual basis, except that prior to receiving such installment payment, the tenant must\ncertify to the State that he is occupying decent, safe and sanitary\nhousing.
