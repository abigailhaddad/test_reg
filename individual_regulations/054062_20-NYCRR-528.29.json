  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 528.29 - Precious metal bullion sold for investment\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1115(a)(27)\n(a) Exemption. Precious metal bullion sold for investment is exempt from\nsales and use tax if: (1)\nthe retailer, if so required, is registered with the Department of State pursuant to section\n359-e\nof the General Business\n\nLaw; (2)\nthe receipt or\nconsideration given or contracted to be given for the bullion depends only on\nthe value of the metal content of the bullion (see subdivision [c] of this\nsection); (3)\nthe total amount of\nthe sale of precious metal bullion on any single invoice is more than $1,000; and\n(4)\nthe purchaser or user or\nagent of either of them holds the bullion in the same form as when it was\npurchased and does not manufacture, process, assemble or fabricate the bullion\nfor its own use. (b) Definition. (1)\n\nPrecious\nmetal bullion\nmeans bars, ingots or coins of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, rhodium, ruthenium or iridium. (2)\n\nPrecious metal bullion does not include: (i) coins of the Republic of South Africa; or\n(ii)\nbars, ingots or coins which\nhave been manufactured, processed, assembled, fabricated or used for an\nindustrial, professional, esthetic or artistic purpose. (c) Metal content of the\nbullion. (1)\n\nSilver coins. With\nrespect to silver coins, the receipt or consideration given or contracted to be\ngiven is deemed to depend only on the metal content of the coin if, at the time\nof sale or purchase at retail, the receipt or consideration does not exceed 140\npercent of the greater of: (i) the daily\nclosing bullion cash price of silver in the open market; or\n(ii)\nthe face value of the silver coins at\nthe prevailing rate of exchange. (2)\n\nGold coins weighing one-quarter ounce or\nless. With respect to gold coins weighing one-quarter ounce or less, the\nreceipt or consideration given or contracted to be given is deemed to depend\nonly on the metal content of the coin if, at the time of sale or purchase at\nretail, the receipt or consideration does not exceed 120 percent of the greater\nof: (i) the daily closing bullion cash price\nof gold in the open market; or\n(ii)\nthe face value of the gold coins at the prevailing rate of exchange. (3)\nother than gold coins weighing\none-quarter ounce or less or silver coins. With respect to coins other than\ngold coins weighing one-quarter ounce or less or silver coins, the receipt or\nconsideration given or contracted to be given is deemed to depend only on the\nmetal content of the coin if, at the time of sale or purchase at retail, the\nreceipt or consideration does not exceed 115 percent of the greater of: (i) the daily closing bullion cash price of\nthe subject precious metal in the open market; or\n(ii)\nthe face value of such coins at the\nprevailing rate of exchange. (4)\n\nBars and ingots of precious metal. With respect to bars and ingots of precious metal, the\nreceipt or consideration given or contracted to be given is deemed to depend\nonly on the metal content of the bars and ingots of precious metal if, at the\ntime of sale or purchase at retail, the receipt or consideration does not\nexceed 115 percent of the daily closing bullion cash price of the subject\nprecious metal in the open market. (5)\n\nFor purposes of this subdivision, the\ndaily closing bullion cash price of the subject precious metal in the\nopen market\nmeans the daily closing bullion cash price of the subject\nprecious metal in the open market for the business day immediately preceding\nthe day of sale or purchase at retail. Where there is no such closing price for\nsuch metal, the average of the bid and asked cash prices for the business day\nimmediately preceding the day of sale or purchase at retail must be substituted\nfor the closing price. (d) Where a vendor sells exempt precious\nmetal bullion together with taxable bullion or other property and does not\nseparately state the charge for the property being sold on the bill or invoice\ngiven to the customer, then the vendor must collect tax on the total amount of\nthe sale. However, if the vendor separately states the charge for the exempt\nprecious metal bullion on the bill or invoice so as to distinguish it from the\nother bullion or property subject to tax, then the vendor need not collect tax\non the portion of the receipts for the exempt bullion. (e) A vendor of precious metal bullion is\nrequired to maintain records sufficient to verify the taxable or exempt status\nof all transactions, as described in section\n533.2\nof this\n\nTitle. Example 1: A registered broker sells 50 silver commemorative coins\nwhich are not legal tender to a purchaser at a price of $25 each. The silver\ncontent of each coin is 3.650 troy ounces and silver closed at $5.675 per troy\nounce on the previous business day. The taxability of this transaction is\ndetermined as follows: Selling price of the coins (50 × $25)\n$1,250.00\n\nValue of the silver content of coins (3.650 × $5.675\n× 50)\n1,035.69\n\nRatio of selling price to value of silver\ncontent\n121%\nThe sale is exempt from tax since the selling price of the\ncoins did not exceed 140 percent of the daily closing cash bullion price of\nsilver and the other requirements of this section are met. Example 2: A registered broker sells a rare foreign gold coin with a\nface value of $20 (U.S.) at the current rate of exchange to a purchaser at a\nprice of $1,250. The coin contains.9575 troy ounces of gold and gold closed on\nthe previous business day at $375.25 per troy ounce. The taxability of this\ntransaction is determined as follows: Selling price of the coin\n$1,250.00\n\nValue of gold content of coin (.9575 × $375.25)\n359.30\n\nFace value of coin at current rate of exchange\n20.00\n\nRatio of selling price of coin to value of gold\ncontent\n348%\nRatio of selling price of coin to face value at\ncurrent rate of exchange\n6250%\nThe sale is taxable. The selling price of the coin exceeds\n115 percent of both the value of the metal content of the coin and the face\nvalue of the coin at the current rate of exchange. Example 3: A manufacturer purchases palladium bullion and uses it in\nthe manufacture of electrical contacts. This purchase does not qualify for\nexemption under this section, since the manufacturer did not purchase the\nbullion for investment. However, since the bullion is being incorporated as a\nphysical component of a product for sale, the manufacturer may purchase the\nbullion tax exempt by issuing a properly completed resale certificate within 90\ndays from the date of sale. Cross-reference: See section\n527.1\n(c) of this Title regarding the sale or exchange of coins and currency not covered\nby the exemption described in this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
