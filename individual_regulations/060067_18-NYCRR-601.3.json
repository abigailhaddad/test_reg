  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 601.3 - Reimbursement claiming time limits\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept as otherwise provided, to be eligible for State\nreimbursement, expenditures for public assistance, care and services, or for\nany other activity which is subject to reimbursement by the department, must be\nmade within the time limits set forth in this section and must be included in a\nclaim submitted by the social services district to the department for the time\nperiod in which such expenditures are claimed to have been made. (a) Claims for expenditures which are subject\nto reimbursement by the Federal government or entities other than the\ndepartment must be submitted to the department in sufficient time so that the\ndepartment can submit claims to the other claiming sources within the time\nrequired by such sources. Claims submitted less than 40 days prior to the time\nby which the department must submit claims for Federal reimbursement may be\nconsidered to be submitted without sufficient time for the department to submit\nsuch claims to other claiming sources. (b) All claims for expenditures for which\n\nFederal financial participation is available under the Social Security Act must\nbe submitted to the department so that such claim can be included in any claim\nsubmissions by the department to the Secretary of the United States Department\nof Health and Human Services within the two-year period which begins on the\nfirst day of the calendar quarter immediately following the calendar quarter in\nwhich such expenditures were made, except with respect to any expenditure\ninvolving court-ordered retroactive payments on audit exceptions, or\nadjustments to prior year costs, unless a waiver for good cause has been made\nby such Secretary for the particular expenditures submitted. (c) Except as otherwise provided within the\nrequirements for any particular activity, expenditures made by a social\nservices district may not be reimbursed if such costs are related to\nexpenditures, services, supplies or other costs incurred on behalf of a\nrecipient or an individual more than 12 months prior to the month in which the\nclaim for reimbursement is made, unless such costs are specifically approved by\nthe department. (d) Claims which\nare rejected will be reexamined only if resubmitted within six months following\nthe date of rejection, provided (1) the initial submittal was made in\naccordance with the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section, and (2) the\ncosts or expenditures subject to reimbursement in the resubmitted claim are\nsubmitted to the department in sufficient time so that the department can\nsubmit such claims to any other claiming source within the time required by\nsuch source. (e) The provisions of\nthis section shall not prevent the department from approving and certifying a\nclaim for State reimbursement when in its judgment the claim has merit and, for\ngood cause, could not have been submitted within the time limits prescribed. The provisions of this subdivision may not be interpreted to require the\ndepartment to approve such claim. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n601.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
