  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 202.12 - Preliminary conference\n\nState Regulations\n\nPreamble. The parties, with the court's assistance, are encouraged to\nconsider as early as possible how best to achieve the most efficient, expeditious and cost-effective resolution of every case. A preliminary\nconference will frequently be a useful and even critical tool for furthering\nthese goals. A preliminary conference should be held before the assigned judge, soon after commencement of the case and after the parties have conferred. An\nin-person conference should not be held, however, if such conference will be\nnon-substantive or involve only the submission of a stipulated order (for\nexample, because of the nature of the case or the caseload of the particular\ncourt or the assigned judge, or otherwise). In such cases, stipulations should\nbe submitted or a scheduling order should be issued in accordance with\nsubdivisions (b) or (g) of this section and counsel should not be required to\nappear. Further, pursuant to section\n202.10\nof this part, the court may\nalso in its discretion, address preliminary conference matters, in whole or in\npart, telephonically or by remote technology with the attorneys for all\nparties. When preliminary conferences are held, the court shall\nengage the parties in a discussion of the merits of the case aimed at\ndetermining how best to resolve the dispute as expeditiously and efficiently as\npossible. Among other topics, the court and the parties may consider at the\npreliminary conference: * the principal factual and legal issues in dispute; * the timing of presumptive mediation and the\nappropriateness of other forms of alternative dispute resolution for the\ndispute; * the timetable for the proceedings, including the\nappropriateness of sequencing motion practice, discovery or other aspects of\nthe case, to address threshold dispositive issues while discovery on other\nissues is held in abeyance; * other matters as set forth in subdivision (c) of this\nsection; and\n* the date for a subsequent conference to follow-up on the\nmatters discussed at the preliminary conference. (a) A party may request a preliminary\nconference at any time after service of process. The request shall state the\ntitle of the action; index number; names, addresses, telephone numbers and\nemail addresses of all attorneys appearing in the action; and the nature of the\naction. If the action has not been assigned to a judge, the party shall file a\nrequest for judicial intervention together with the request for a preliminary\nconference. The request shall be served on all other parties and filed with the\nclerk for transmittal to the assigned judge. The court shall order a date for\npreliminary conference in any action upon such request and subject to the\nfollowing. (b) In the absence of a\nparty request as set forth in subdivision (a), and except as provided in\nsubdivision (g), after the filing of a request for judicial intervention, the\ncourt shall promptly email to all parties the form of a stipulation and order, prescribed by the Chief Administrator of the Courts which shall provide for\ncompletion of disclosure within twelve (12) months of the filing of the request\nfor judicial intervention for a standard case, or within fifteen (15) months of\nsuch filing for a complex case. The form of the stipulation shall contain a\ncertification by attorneys for the parties that they have met and conferred on\nthe items set forth in sections\n202.11\nand\n202.12\n(c). If all\nparties sign the form and return it to the court within thirty (30) days, such\nform shall be \"so ordered\" by the court and no preliminary conference shall be\nheld unless the court orders otherwise. If such stipulation is not returned\nsigned by all parties, the court shall schedule a conference to be held\nvirtually before the court or, in the court's discretion, nonjudicial\npersonnel, for the purpose of completing the form stipulation. Except where a\nparty appears in the action pro se, an attorney thoroughly familiar with the\naction and authorized to act on behalf of the party shall appear at such\nconference. (1)\n\nIf the parties agree on the\nform stipulation it may be \"so ordered\" by the court. Where the parties cannot\nagree, or where issues arise that need judicial intervention, the court may\nschedule a conference before the assigned judge or before the judge in charge\nof the preliminary conference part. At the discretion of the court, the\nconference may be held virtually or in person. (2)\n\nAt the preliminary conference the parties\nshall be prepared to discuss the items set forth in sections\n202.11\nand\n202.12\n(c) and\nsuch other items as the court may direct. (c) Where a case is reasonably likely to\ninclude electronic discovery, attorneys for all parties shall meet and confer\non the subject of electronic discovery. If the parties are unable to reach a\nstipulation governing electronic discovery, the court may direct a conference\non the subject. The parties or attorneys appearing at such conference must be\nsufficiently versed in matters relating to their clients' technological systems\nto discuss competently all issues relating to electronic discovery, and\nattorneys may bring a client representative or outside expert to assist in such\ne-discovery discussions. A non-exhaustive list of considerations for\ndetermining whether a case is reasonably likely to include electronic discovery\nis: (1)\n\nDoes potentially relevant\nelectronically stored information (\"ESI\") exist; (2)\n\nDo any of the parties intend to seek or\nrely upon ESI; (3)\n\nAre there less\ncostly or less burdensome alternatives to secure the necessary information\nwithout recourse to discovery of ESI; (4)\n\nThe cost and burden of preserving and\nproducing ESI and whether such costs and burdens are proportional to the amount\nin controversy; and\n(5)\n\nWhat is the\nlikelihood that discovery of ESI will aid in the resolution of the\ndispute. (d) The court\nmay, in its discretion, either in advance of the preliminary conference or in\nresponse to the filing of the stipulation and order contemplated by subdivision\n(b) of this section, require the parties to provide to the court their\npositions on each of the items in sections\n202.11\nand\n202.12\n(c) and\nsuch other matters as the court deems necessary or appropriate. (e) The matters which may be considered at a\npreliminary conference or at the first conference before the court if the\npreliminary conference has been cancelled under sections\n202.12\n(b) or\n202.12\n(g), shall\ninclude: (1)\nthe positions of the litigants on\nthe matters described in sections\n202.11\nand\n202.12\n(c), particularly alternative methods for resolving the dispute, simplification and\nlimitation of factual and legal issues, where appropriate, expedited\ndisposition of the action, and effective controls to prevent protracted\nlitigation due to lack of judicial management; (2)\nthe terms, provisions and schedule\nincluded in the stipulation described above submitted by the attorneys for the\nlitigants, and the establishment of a timetable for the completion of all\ndisclosure proceedings, provided that all such procedures must be completed\nwithin the timeframes set forth in subdivision (b) of this section, unless\notherwise shortened or extended by the court depending upon the circumstances\nof the case; (3)\n\nWhere the court\ndeems appropriate, it may establish the method and scope of any electronic\ndiscovery. In establishing the method and scope of electronic discovery, the\ncourt may consider the following non-exhaustive list, including but not limited\nto: (i) identification of potentially\nrelevant types or categories of ESI and the relevant time frame; (ii)\ndisclosure of the applications and\nmanner in which the ESI is maintained; (iii)\nidentification of potentially relevant\nsources of ESI and whether the ESI is reasonably accessible; (iv)\nimplementation of a preservation plan\nfor potentially relevant ESI; (v) identification of the individual(s) responsible for preservation of\nESI; (vi)\nthe scope, extent, order, and form of production; (vii)\nidentification, redaction, labeling, and logging of privileged or confidential\nESI; (viii)\nclaw-back or other\nprovisions for privileged or protected ESI; (ix)\nthe scope or method for searching and\nreviewing ESI; and (x) the anticipated cost and burden of data recovery and\nproposed initial allocation of such cost. (4)\naddition of other necessary\nparties; (5)\nsettlement of the\naction; (6)\nremoval to a lower\ncourt pursuant to CPLR 325, where appropriate; and\n(7)\nany other matters that the court may deem\nrelevant. (f) At the\nconclusion of the conference, the court shall make a written order including\nits directions to the parties as well as stipulations of the parties'\nattorneys. Alternatively, in the court's discretion, all directions of the\ncourt and stipulations of counsel the attorneys may be recorded by a reporter. Where the latter procedure is followed, the parties shall procure and share\nequally the cost of a transcript thereof unless the court in its discretion\notherwise provides. The transcript, corrected if necessary on motion or by\nstipulation of the parties approved by the court, shall have the force and\neffect of an order of the court. The transcript shall be filed by the plaintiff\nwith the clerk of the court. (g) In\nits discretion, taking into account the caseload of the court, the nature of\nthe claim, the absence of an IAS judge to preside, the inability of a defendant\nto retain counsel, the failure of an insurer to appoint counsel, or the\ninability of the parties to meet and confer, the presiding court, either in\nadvance of the preliminary conference or at the request of one of the parties, may issue to all parties a case scheduling order setting forth a timetable\nwhich shall provide for completion of disclosure within 12 months of the filing\nof the request for judicial intervention for a standard case, or within 15\nmonths of such filing for a complex case. If a case scheduling order is issued\nby the court the order may also provide for other terms and conditions as the\ncourt deems appropriate, and the preliminary conference shall be cancelled. In\nresponse to such scheduling order, any party may, within 10 days of entry of\nthe scheduling order, object thereto and request a preliminary conference as\ndescribed above. (h) In the\ndiscretion of the court, failure by a party to comply with the order or\ntranscript resulting from the preliminary conference, or with the so-ordered\nstipulation or scheduling order provided for in subdivisions (b) and (g) of\nthis section, or the making of unnecessary or frivolous motions by a party, shall result in the imposition upon such party of costs or such other sanctions\nas are authorized by law. (i) A\nparty may request the court to advance the date of a preliminary conference\nupon a showing of appropriate circumstances. During the course of the case, any\nparty may request such additional conferences as appropriate. The court will\ngive the attorneys notice of the conference at least one week before any\nconference unless there are special circumstances requiring an earlier\nconference. (j) The court, in its\ndiscretion, at any time may order such conferences as the court may deem\nhelpful or necessary in any matter before the court. (k) The provisions of this section shall\napply to preliminary conferences required in matrimonial actions and actions\nbased upon a separation agreement, in medical malpractice actions, and in real\nproperty tax assessment review proceedings within the City of New York, only to\nthe extent that these provisions are not inconsistent with the provisions of\nsections\n202.16, 202.56\nand\n202.60\nof this Part, respectively. (l) The provisions of\nthis section shall apply where a request is filed for a preliminary conference\nin an action involving a terminally ill party governed by CPLR 3407 only to the\nextent that the provisions of this section are not inconsistent with the\nprovisions of CPLR 3407. In an action governed by CPLR 3407 the request for a\npreliminary conference may be filed at any time after commencement of the\naction, and shall be accompanied by the physician's affidavit required by that\nprovision.
