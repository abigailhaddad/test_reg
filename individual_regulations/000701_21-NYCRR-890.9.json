Tit. 21 § 890.9 - Schedule of phased reductions in diversions, releases and flow objectives during drought\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Criteria defining conditions. For purposes of water management pursuant to section\n3.3\nand article 10 of the compact, diversions of water from the Delaware River Basin by the City of New York and\n\nState of New Jersey, compensating reservoir releases from the New York City\n\nDelaware Basin Reservoirs, reservoir releases from Beltzville Reservoir, Blue\n\nMarsh Reservoir, and other reservoirs under the jurisdiction or control of the\ncommission, and streamflow objectives at the USGS gaging stations located at\n\nMontague, New Jersey, and Trenton, New Jersey, shall be governed by a schedule\nbased upon a differentiation among \"normal\", \"drought warning\", and \"drought\"\nconditions defined by the combined storage in the Cannonsville, Pepacton and\n\nNeversink Reservoirs as set forth in Figure 1 entitled \"Operation Curves for\n\nCannonsville, Pepacton and Neversink Reservoirs\". The division of the\ndrought-warning zone into upper and lower halves shall be defined as a\nphysically equal division, or 20 billions of gallons in each zone. (b) Schedule of\nreductions. The schedules of phased reductions set forth in Tables 1\nand 2 shall govern (1) the maximum allowable rates of diversion of waters from\nthe Delaware River Basin by the City of New York and State of New Jersey; (2)\nthe minimum compensating releases to be made by the City of New York from its\nreservoirs in the upper Delaware Basin; and the streamflow objectives at the\nUSGS gaging stations located at Montague, New Jersey and Trenton, New\n\nJersey.

(1)\n\nThe City of New York may divert waters\nfrom the Delaware Basin at maximum rates equivalent to the quantities set forth\nin Table 1. (2)\n\nThe State of New\n\nJersey may divert waters from the Delaware River Basin, from the Delaware River\nor its tributaries in New Jersey, at maximum rates equivalent to the quantities\nset forth in Table 1. (3)\n\nThe City\nof New York shall release water from one or more of its storage reservoirs in\nthe upper Delaware Basin in quantities designed to maintain the minimum basic\nrates of flow at the USGS gaging station located at Montague, New Jersey, as\nset forth in Tables 1 and 2. (d) Computation of diversions. (1)\n\nDiversions by the City of New York during\n\"normal\" conditions, as defined by Figure 1, shall be computed as provided in\nsection III.A.4. of the amended\n\nDecree of the U. S. Supreme Court in\n\nNew Jersey\nv. New York, 347 U.S. 995\n(1954). At no\ntime during a twelve-month period of the Water Year, commencing June 1, shall\nthe aggregate total quantity diverted by the City of New York, divided by the\nnumber of days elapsed since the preceding May 31, exceed the maximum permitted\nrate of diversion. (2)\n\nDiversions\nby the State of New Jersey during \"normal\" periods, as defined by Figure 1, shall be computed as provided in Section V.B. of the amended\n\nDecree of\nthe U.S. Supreme Court in New Jersey\nv. New York, 347 U.S. 995\n(1954). The total diversion by the State of New Jersey shall not\nexceed an average of 100 mgd as a monthly average, with the diversion on any\nday not to exceed 120 million gallons, and its total diversion without\ncompensating releases shall not exceed 100 mgd during any calendar\nyear. (3)\n\nDiversions by the City of\n\nNew York and State of New Jersey set forth in Table 1 during \"drought warning\"\nand \"drought\" conditions as defined by Figure 1, shall be computed as a daily\nrunning average, commencing on the day such drought warning or drought\noperations become effective, as provided in subdivision (e) of this section. If\nthe allowable diversion for any condition period following entry into drought\nwarning operations is not fully used, the unused portion may not be credited or\nused during subsequent periods. (4)\n\nUpon return to normal condition operations, following a period of drought\nwarning or drought operations, diversions by the City of New York and State of\n\nNew Jersey shall be computed as averages commencing upon the date of return to\nnormal operations. (e) Effective period for drought operating schedule. (1)\n\nThe schedule of diversions, releases and\nstreamflow objectives for \"drought warning\" operations as provided in\nsubdivision (b) of this section shall go into effect automatically whenever the\ncombined storage in the New York City Delaware Basin reservoirs declines below\nthe drought warning line defined in Figure 1 and remains below that line for\nfive consecutive days. (2)\n\nThe\nschedule of diversions, releases and streamflow objectives for \"drought\"\noperations as provided in subdivision (b) of this section shall go into effect\nimmediately whenever the combined storage in the New York City Delaware Basin\nreservoirs declines below the drought line defined in Figure 1, and remains\nbelow that line for five consecutive days. (3)\n\nWhen the combined storage in the New York\n\nCity Delaware Basin reservoirs (including the projected water runoff equivalent\nof actual snow and ice within the watersheds tributary to the reservoirs)\nreaches a level 15 billion gallons above the drought warning line, as defined\nin Figure 1, and remains above that level for five consecutive days, the\ndrought warning and drought operations schedules set forth in subdivision (b)\nof this section shall automatically terminate, and normal operations shall be\nresumed as provided in the amended\n\nDecree of the U. S. Supreme Court in\n\nNew Jersey\nv. New York, 347 U.S. 995\n(1954). (4)\n\nPursuant to section\n3.3\n(a) of the\ncompact, the parties to the\nU. S. Supreme Court Decree in New\n\nJersey\nv. New York, 347 U.S. 995\n(1954), have given\ntheir unanimous consent to adoption and implementation by the commission of the\ndrought operation schedules provided in this section. The parties have agreed\nthat the drought operation formula will go into effect automatically, and be\nbinding on parties for not less than 180 days following the triggering of\ndrought warning operations, unless terminated automatically by improved storage\nconditions as provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section. During the 180-day\nperiod following triggering of drought warning operations, authorized\nrepresentatives of the City of New York, States of Delaware, New Jersey, and\n\nNew York, and Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as parties to the U. S. Supreme\n\nCourt Decree, shall convene no less frequently than once each month to review\ncurrent conditions, and they may extend, modify, or extend as modified the\nschedules provided in this section. If no unanimous agreement as to a\ncontinuing drought operation formula is reached within the 180-day period, all\nparties shall be released from the terms of the formula and schedules and may\npursue their rights and obligations under the Delaware River Basin Compact and\nthe U.S. Supreme Court Decree.
