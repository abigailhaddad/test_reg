  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 459.14 - Installment plan\n\nState Regulations\n\nNo utility shall terminate service unless the utility has\nfirst offered a monthly installment plan that is just and equitable. Each\nutility must offer a just and equitable monthly plan to all customers whose\nservice has been disconnected for nonpayment. To the extent practicable, the\nmonthly installment plan should be based on the customer's ability to pay, past\npayment history, the amount of indebtedness, and the availability of other\nresources. The monthly installment plan should require a customer to pay\ncurrent bills and a portion of past indebtedness and may include a provision\nfor payment of interest on the arrears. Such agreement may provide for a\ndownpayment of the arrears provided that no such downpayment shall exceed\none-half of the amount of the arrears or three months average billing, whichever is less. Such agreement may be renegotiated and amended where the\ncustomer can demonstrate that there have been significant changes in his or her\nfinancial circumstances which have arisen due to conditions beyond the\ncustomer's control. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n459.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
