  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 275.12 - Special procedures during cold weather periods\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Not later than August 15, 1978, each and\nevery gas corporation and gas and electric corporation shall develop methods to\nidentify all residential households in its service territory which require gas\nservice for heating the premises or operating a heating system. Thereafter, such corporation shall maintain the capability of identifying such residential\naccounts for the purposes of this section. (b) During the period beginning November 1 of\neach year and ending April 15 of the following year, each gas corporation shall\nobserve, at a minimum, the following procedures with respect to residential\ncustomers whose gas service is necessary to heat the premises or operate a\nheating system (as used in this section, the term customer means a residential\ncustomer whose gas service is necessary to heat the premises or operate a\nheating system and includes all customers residing in dwellings not included\nunder section\n116\nof the\n\nPublic Service Law): (1)\n\nNo such corporation\nshall terminate service to any customer unless, after service of a final notice\nof discontinuance, the corporation has attempted to communicate with the\ncustomer, or another person, 18 years of age or older, who resides with the\ncustomer, at the customer's residence. At a minimum, the attempt at personal\ncontact shall include one visit at the premises by field personnel during\nnormal working hours and, in the event that personal contact is not achieved, one visit by field personnel during reasonable nonbusiness periods (6 p.m.-9\np.m. on weekdays or 9 a.m.-5 p.m. on Saturdays, Sundays and holidays). If\ncommunication with the person contacted is not possible because of an apparent\nlanguage barrier, the corporation shall take steps to assure communication\nbefore discontinuance. During the personal contacts, the corporation's\nrepresentatives shall fully explain the reasons for discontinuance and shall\nattempt to ascertain whether a serious impairment to human health may\nresult. (2)\n\nFor the purposes of\nthis Part, a serious impairment to human health is indicated if a customer or\nother person residing in the premises appears to be seriously impaired and may, because of mental or physical problems, be unable to manage his or her own\nresources, carry out activities of daily living or protect oneself from neglect\nor hazardous situations without assistance from others. Indicators of serious\nimpairment to human health include but are not limited to: (i) age, infirmity or mental\nincapacitation; (ii)\nuse of life\nsupport systems, such as dialysis machines or iron lungs; (iii)\nserious illness; (iv)\nphysical disability, including blindness\nand limited mobility; (v) any other\nfactual circumstances which indicate severe or hazardous health situations. The\nabove criteria are general standards and the corporation's field personnel must\nbe trained to exercise discretion, sound judgment and common sense in\nascertaining whether a serious impairment to human health exists. Doubts should\nbe resolved in favor of continued service. (3)\n\nNo such corporation shall terminate\nservice for nonpayment where a customer or other person residing in the\npremises exhibits a serious impairment to human health, as described in\nparagraph (b)(2) of this section, unless: (i) the corporation notifies the local social services commissioner orally, and\nwithin five days in writing, on forms prescribed or approved by the commission\n(Appendix 16 contains the suggested form), that the customer or other person\nresiding in the premises exhibits a serious impairment to human health; and\n(ii)\nthe local social services\ncommissioner, after an investigation, informs the corporation that the\nhealth-impairing condition does not exist or is not serious, or that an\nalternative means for protecting the person's health has been devised. The\ncorporation may exercise its own discretion with respect to terminating service\nto the customer in the event it does not receive an oral or written report from\nthe local social services commissioner within 15 business days after the\nwritten referral of the matter by the corporation to the\ncommissioner. (4)\n\nIf\nsuch a corporation terminates gas service to a customer because of nonpayment\nand the customer or a person 18 years of age or older residing on the premises\nwas not personally contacted by the corporation before termination of service\nand has not communicated with the corporation for the purpose of requesting\nreconnection before 12 noon on the day following termination of service, the\ncorporation shall immediately attempt to determine, by onsite inspection, direct personal contact at the premises with the residential customer or other\nadult person, or other reasonable measures, whether there is continuing\noccupancy and whether a serious impairment to human health, as described in\nparagraph (b)(2) of this section, exists. If the corporation determines that a\ncustomer or other person residing in the premises faces impairment to his or\nher health, it shall immediately restore the gas service and the requirements\nof paragraph (b)(3) of this section shall apply. If the corporation is unable\nto obtain personal contact with the customer or an adult residing on the\npremises, and does not have reasonable grounds to believe that the customer has\nvacated the premises, it shall immediately refer the name and address of the\ncustomer to the local commissioner of social services, in accordance with the\nprocedures set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of this section. (5)\n\nEach such corporation shall designate an\nemployee who will serve as a liaison with local social services\ndepartments. (6)\n\nEach such\ncorporation shall file with the commission for its review the procedures to be\nfollowed by the corporation's personnel in complying with these special\nprocedures. (c) If such\ncorporation decides to disconnect gas service to a residential customer because\nit has established that the meter or service laterals have been tampered with\nor a theft of service has occurred, it shall attempt to determine, according to\nthe procedures set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, whether\na serious impairment would result from service disconnection. If such\ncorporation ascertains that a serious impairment to human health would result, it shall observe the procedures set forth in paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this\nsection; provided, however, that the requirement of continued service shall not\napply in the event it is impractical for such corporation to eliminate any\nunsafe condition. In any case where a serious impairment is found and the\ncorporation terminates service to preclude the continuation of an unsafe\ncondition, it shall specially notify the local social services commissioner on\nthe same day service is disconnected and request an immediate consideration of\nthe case. Comment:If a utility discovers a meter tampering or theft\nsituation and determines that a serious impairment exists, it should continue\nservice, pending DSS review, provided that service can be rendered safely. For\nexample, if a utility discovers that the meter of a \"locked account\" is\nadvancing, it should, in most circumstances, be able to continue service in a\nsafe manner. In other theft cases, particularly those involving gas service, the need for rendering the condition safe may preclude the continuation of\nservice. For example, if a gas utility discovers unsafe piping, an unsafe meter\nbypass or substantial damage to the meter, termination may be the best method\nof eliminating the unsafe condition. If the utility cannot readily repair the\nunsafe condition or, in the case of a gas company, cannot obtain access to the\npilot lights (which would have to be relit), immediate restoration of service\nwould not be practical. The utility should specifically note, in its referrals\nto DSS, those cases where heat-related service is not restored or continued so\nthat DSS may give immediate attention to them. Notes\nN.Y.
