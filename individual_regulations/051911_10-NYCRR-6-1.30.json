  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 6-1.30 - Saturation index for swimming pools\n\nState Regulations\n\nSaturation index is equal to the pH plus a temperature factor, plus a calcium hardness factor, plus an alkalinity factor, minus the constant 12.1. S.I. = pH + TF + CF + AF - 12.1\n\nThe optimum saturation index is zero. Tolerance limits are plus or minus 0.5. If the index is positive (+), the water is super-saturated with CaCO\n3\nand may deposit a protective coating or scale in the pipeline, particularly metal filters, valves and pumps. If the index is negative (-), water will dissolve CaCO\n3\nand may be corrosive. Temp.

S.I. = 7.8 + 0.52 + 1.76 + 1.22 - 12.1 = (-)0.8 Therefore, the water is corrosive................ Note: Saturation index must be maintained slightly on the positive side within the tolerance limits. Normal Control Levels: pH: 7.4 - 7.8\nfree chlorine: 0.6 (minimum)\ntemperature: 78° - 80° (indoor)\nsaturation index: (-)0.5 - (+)0.5\ntotal alkalinity: 80 - 120 mg/l\ncalcium hardness: 180 - 250 mg/l\n\nAlkalinity control: to increase - 1 1/2 lb of sodium bicarbonate NaHCO\n3\nbaking soda will raise the alkalinity of 10,000 gallons of water by 10 mg/l. to lower - add muriatic acid no more than one pint ( 1/8 gallon) per 5,000 gallons of pool water will lower alkalinity by 12 mg/l (or, add 1.25 lb of sodium bisulfate). pH: to increase - use soda ash. to decrease - muriatic acid or sodium bisulfate. Hardness Control: Calcium hardness is assumed to be 70% of total hardness. to increase - 1 lb of calcium chloride will raise the calcium hardness of 10,000 gallons of water by 11 mg/l. It should be added in small amounts. To lower, dilute with soft water. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n6-1.30\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
