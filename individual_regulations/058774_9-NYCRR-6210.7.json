(c) In the first year that the voting system\nis in use, a copy of the final form and arrangement of each ballot\nconfiguration shall be filed with the State Board. (d) Ballots shall be identified by ballot\nconfiguration, using marks which are machine readable and human readable text. A sheet of ballot paper becomes a ballot when the contents of the ballot are\nprinted thereon. (e) Ballots to be\nused with poll site optical scan voting systems, shall be in a form consistent\nwith Election Law. Each ballot shall have a numbered stub which can be\nseparated from it along a perforated boundary. Such ballot shall be detached\nfrom the numbered stub prior to the election inspector giving the ballot to the\nvoter and be retained by the county board in a manner consistent with\nelection-related document retention requirements.

(6)\n\nBallot packages and any transmittal sheet, shall be delivered to inspectors\nwith other election day supplies, in a separate, secure, sealed and labeled\ncontainer, envelope or pouch. (7)\n\nOnly one ballot package at a time should be on the inspector table, and the\nremaining booklets shall be kept in their secure container, envelope or\npouch. (8)\n\nUpon opening a package\nof ballots that are not stubbed, the inspectors shall count the number of\nballots in such package to ensure it is the number indicated on the coversheet. When all ballots in a package have been used, leaving only the cover and the\nstapled pad of stubs, in the case of ballots that are stubbed, such package\nshall be returned to the ballot package container/ envelope/pouch and the next\nappropriately numbered ballot package shall be removed for use.
