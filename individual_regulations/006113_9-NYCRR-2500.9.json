However, housing accommodations in buildings\ncompleted or substantially rehabilitated prior to January 1, 1974, and whose\nrentals were previously regulated under the PHFL or any other State or Federal\n\nLaw, shall become subject to the ETPA and this Title, upon the termination of\nsuch regulation; (d) (1)\nhousing accommodations in a building\ncontaining fewer than six dwelling units, or fewer than such other, larger\nthreshold number of units as the local legislative body, in its determination\nof emergency as specified in section\n2500.8\nof this Part, may have\nchosen; (2)\nfor purposes of this\nsubdivision, a building shall be deemed to contain six or more dwelling units\nif it is part of a multiple family garden-type maisonette dwelling complex\ncontaining six or more dwelling units having common facilities such as a sewer\nline, water main or heating plant and operated as a unit under common\nownership, notwithstanding that certificates of occupancy were issued for\nportions therefor as one- or two-family dwellings; (e) housing accommodations in buildings\ncompleted or buildings substantially rehabilitated as family units on or after\n\nJanuary 1, 1974, except such buildings which are made subject to this\n\nSubchapter by provision of the act or any other statute that meet the following\ncriteria, which at the division's discretion, may be effectuated by Operational\n\nBulletin; (1)\na specified percentage, of at\nleast 75% of listed building-wide and apartment systems, must have been\nreplaced; (2)\nthe rehabilitation\nmust have been commenced in a building that was in a substandard or seriously\ndeteriorated condition.

If there has been a finding of harassment by a\ngovernmental entity other than the division, that finding shall be considered\nin full force for three years from the date the finding was made, unless proof\nof its being lifted is provided or otherwise obtained; (4)\nin order for there to be a finding of\nsubstantial rehabilitation, all building systems must comply with all\napplicable building codes and requirements, and the owner must submit copies of\nthe building's certificate of occupancy, if such certificate is required by\nlaw, before and after the rehabilitation; (5)\noccupied rent regulated housing\naccommodations have not been rehabilitated, such housing accommodations shall\nremain regulated until vacated, notwithstanding a finding that the remainder of\nthe building has been substantially rehabilitated, and therefore qualifies for\nexemption from regulation; (6)\nwhere, because of the existence of hazardous conditions in his or her housing\naccommodation, a tenant has been ordered by a governmental agency to vacate\nsuch housing accommodation, and the tenant has received a court order or an\norder of the division that provides for payment by the tenant of a nominal\nrental amount while the vacate order is in effect, and permits the tenant to\nresume occupancy without interruption of the rent stabilized status of the\nhousing accommodation upon restoration of the housing accommodation to a\nhabitable condition, such housing accommodation will be excepted from any\nfinding of substantial rehabilitation otherwise applicable to the building.

The DHCR may waive the\nrequirement that the tenant expresses a desire not to return in writing at its\ndiscretion if the owner demonstrates that the tenant could not be found after\nthe owner undertook a good faith effort to locate and contact them, and the\ntenant has failed to make the nominal rent payment for a period of at least six\nmonths; (7)\nwhen an accommodation\nhas been rendered uninhabitable and the tenant has received an order as\ndescribed in paragraph (6) of this subdivision, the owner will restore the\nbuilding to a layout that is substantially similar to the building layout prior\nto the building being rendered uninhabitable, unless the owner can demonstrate\nthat doing so would be financially infeasible.
