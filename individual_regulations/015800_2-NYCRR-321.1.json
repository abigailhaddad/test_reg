  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 321.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Retirement and Social Security Law provides that members\nof the Retirement System become eligible under certain circumstances for a\nvested retirement allowance, or for a particular service retirement allowance\nfor service credited in a specified retirement plan. However, some members of\nthe Retirement System, having become eligible for such benefits, subsequently\nterminate their employment with the participating employer in whose employ they\nhave established such eligibility, and then either commence or continue in the\nemploy of a different participating employer which offers its employees a\nretirement plan which provides less favorable benefits. When such a member of\nthe Retirement System then applies for retirement, his retirement allowance is\ndetermined in accordance with the retirement plan of the employer by which he\nwas last employed. Since it would be inequitable, and inconsistent with the\nintent of the Legislature, to provide such a member with a retirement allowance\nwhich is less than that to which he was entitled by virtue of his eligibility\nat the time he terminated his employment with the participating employer with\nwhich he had earned such status, and since sections\n11\nand\n311\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw permit the State Comptroller to adopt and amend rules and regulations for\nthe administration of the New York State Employees's Retirement System and the\n\nNew York State Policemen's and Firemen's Retirement System, the following\nmethod of determining a member's retirement allowance in such circumstances is\nhereby promulgated. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n321.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
