(3)\n\nPunctuation marks and accent marks are\ntreated as follows: (i) All periods, commas\nand dashes (hyphens) are replaced with a space (provided, however, that if the\nword \"co-op\" appears anywhere in the name, the hyphen in \"co-op\" is not\nreplaced with a space; instead, the word \"co-op\" is replaced with the word\n\"coop\").

The pre-July 1, 2001 index (including the alternative\nname index) will then be searched for each stored name that is an exact match\nto either of such character strings. In searching for such matches, the\nfollowing rules will apply: (i) The search\nresults will reflect only the name as submitted in the search request (as\nmodified by application of the rules set forth in paragraphs [1] through [6] of\nthis subdivision), without variations. So-called \"similar matches\" or\n\"proximity matches\" will not be included in the search results. (ii)\n\nThe presence or absence of a middle name\nor middle initial is significant.

(iii)\n\nThe order in which the components of\nthe name were set forth in the filed document is significant. (9)\n\nIn the case of a search\nagainst an individual, if the search request has no entry in the first name\nfield, then: (i) the entry (if any) in the\nmiddle name field of the search request and the entry (if any) in the suffix\nfield of the search request will be ignored; and\n(ii)\nfor the purpose of searching the\npre-July 1, 2001 index, only one character string will be created, and that\ncharacter string will be the name specified in the last name field of the\nsearch request; and\n(iii)\nthe\npre-July 1, 2001 index (including the alternative name index) will be searched\nfor each stored name that is an exact match to such character string. For example, if a search request has \"Smith\" in the last\nname field, no entry in the first name field, no entry (or any entry) in the\nmiddle name field, and no entry (or any entry) in the suffix field, the\npre-July 1, 2001 index will be searched for stored names that match the\ncharacter string \"SMITH.\" The search will retrieve pre-July 1, 2001 filings in\nwhich the debtor name is specified as \"Smith,\" but will not retrieve any\npre-July 1, 2001 filing in which the debtor name contains \"Smith\" and any other\nword(s), initial(s), or abbreviation(s). (d) The rules set forth in this subdivision\napply to names stored in the post-July 1, 2001 index and to searches by the\ncentral filing office for names stored in the post-July 1, 2001 index.

(3)\n\nPunctuation\nmarks and accent marks are treated as follows: (i) All periods, commas and dashes (hyphens)\nare replaced with a space (provided, however, that if the word \"co-op\" appears\nanywhere in the name, the hyphen in \"co-op\" is not replaced with a space; instead, the word \"co-op\" is replaced with the word \"coop\"). (ii)\n\nAll other punctuation marks, and all\naccent marks, are disregarded. (4)\n(i) The\nwords, phrases and abbreviations set forth in subparagraph (c)(4)(i) of this\nsection, if located at the end of the name, will be disregarded. (ii)\n\nAfter the words phrases and\nabbreviations set forth in subparagraph (c)(4)(i) of this section have been\nremoved from the end of the name, the name will be reviewed again, and if the\nword \"COMPANY\" or the abbreviation \"CO\" is then located at the end of the name, such word or abbreviation will be disregarded. (5)\n\nThe following words, anywhere in the\nname, will be disregarded: \"the,\" \"of,\" \"and\" and \"or.\"\n(6)\n\nAll spaces, and all characters other than\nletters (A to Z) or numbers (0 to 9), will be disregarded.

(ii)\n\nNotwithstanding subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, an initial in the first name field or the middle name field of a\nsearch request is treated as the logical equivalent of all names that begin\nwith such initial (and, for example, a search request with an initial in the\nfirst name field will retrieve post-July 1, 2001 filings with that initial, or\nany name beginning with that initial, specified in the first name field\n[provided that the name otherwise matches the search request]); however, an\ninitial in the first name field or middle name field of a filing is not treated\nas the logical equivalent of all names that begin with such initial (and, for\nexample, a filing that specifies the initial \"J.\" in the first name field will\nnot be retrieved by a search request that specifies \"John\" in the first name\nfield). (iii)\n\nNotwithstanding\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, a search request with no entry in the\nmiddle name field will retrieve post-July 1, 2001 filings with no name or\ninitial, or any name or initial, specified in the middle name field (provided\nthat the name otherwise matches the search request).

(v) If the search request\ncontains an entry in the suffix field: (a) the search will retrieve a post-July 1, 2001 filing with an entry in the suffix\nfield only if the suffix as specified in the filing exactly matches the suffix\nas specified in the search request (and the name in the filing otherwise\nmatches the name in the search request); and\n(b) notwithstanding subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, the search will retrieve post- July 1, 2001 filings with no entry in\nthe suffix field (provided that the name in the filing otherwise matches the\nname in the search request). (vi)\n\nExcept as provided in subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph with respect to initials in the first name field and middle\nname field, an abbreviation of a word is not treated as the logical equivalent\nof the word. (vii)\n\nThe fields in\nwhich the components of the name were set forth in the filed document is\nsignificant. (viii)\n\nNicknames are\nnot treated as the logical equivalent of a given name. (8)\n\nIn the case of a search against the name\nof an organization, the post-July 1, 2001 index will be searched (in the\norganization debtor category only) for each stored name that is an exact match\nto the name specified in the search request (as modified by application of the\nrules set forth in paragraphs [1] through [6] of this subdivision). In\nsearching for such matches, the following rules will apply: (i) The search results will reflect only the\nname as submitted in the search request (as modified by application of the\nrules set forth in paragraphs [1] through [6] of this subdivision), without\nvariations. So-called \"similar matches\" or \"proximity matches\" will not be\nincluded in the search results. (ii)\n\nAn abbreviation of a word is not treated\nas the logical equivalent of the word. (iii)\n\nThe order in which the components of\nthe name were set forth in the filed document is significant. (e) After using the\npreceding rules to modify the name of the debtor requested to be searched, the\nsearch will reveal only names of debtors that exactly match the name requested\n(as modified). (f) Reports created\nin response to a search request shall include the following: (1)\nidentification of the filing office and\nthe certification of the filing officer required by law; (2)\nthe date the report was\ngenerated; (3)\nidentification of\nthe name searched; (4)\nthe\ncertification date and time for which the search is effective; (5)\nidentification of each unlapsed initial\nfinancing statement filed on or prior to the certification date and time\ncorresponding to the search criteria, by name of debtor, by file number, and by\nfile date (and, if requested in the search request, identification of each\nlapsed initial financing statement filed on or prior to the certification date\ncorresponding to the search criteria, by name of debtor, by file number, and by\nfile date, provided that a record of such initial financing statement is still\nmaintained by the filing office under section 9-522[a] of the UCC on the\ncertification date); and\n(6)\nfor\neach initial financing statement identified in the report, a copy of the first\npage of each related UCC document (if any) filed by the filing office on or\nprior to the certification date (or, in lieu of a copy of the first page of\nsuch related UCC document, other information sufficient to identify such\nrelated UCC document). (g) If a search request presented to the\ncentral filing office is limited by the city (or city and state) of the debtor\n(see section\n143-4.2\n[e]\nof\nthis Subpart), filings will be returned only if the city (or city and state) as\nspecified in the search request exactly match(es) the city (or city and state)\nas specified in the filed document. For the purposes of determining if the city\n(or city and state) as specified in an address-limited search request presented\nto the central filing office exactly match(es) the city (or city and state)\nspecified in a filed document: (1)\nhuman\njudgment does not play a role. The search results will reflect only the city\nname (or city and state names) as submitted in the search request, without\nvariations. So-called \" similar matches\" or \"proximity matches\" will not be\nincluded in the search results; (2)\nan abbreviation of a word is not considered to be an exact match for the word\nfully spelled out; and\n(3)\nif the\naddress-limited search request specifies a city but not a state, the search\nwill retrieve filings in which the city as specified in the filed document\nexactly matches the city as specified in the search request, without regard to\nthe state specified in the filed document.
