  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 82.2 - Unlawful acts of an agent\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 483, 484(a) and 485(d)\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of\nlaw and except as specifically provided for in subdivision (c) of this section\nwith respect to sales of cigarettes to other agents, it shall be unlawful and a\nviolation of article 20-A of the Tax Law for any agent, with the intent to\ninjure competitors or to destroy or substantially lessen competition, or with\nthe intent to avoid the collection or paying over of any taxes as may be\nrequired by law, to advertise, offer to sell or sell cigarettes in New York\n\nState at less than the cost of the agent. See Part 83 of this Title relating to\nprima facie evidence of such intentions. (b) (1)\n\nCost of the agent. The term\ncost of the agent\nmeans the basic\ncost of cigarettes (as defined in section\n80.2\nof\nthis Title) plus the cost of doing business by the agent. There shall be\ndetermined a separate cost of the agent: (i) for sales of cigarettes by the agent to CMSA wholesale dealers; (ii)\nfor sales of cigarettes by the agent to\nchain stores; and\n(iii)\nfor sales\nof cigarettes by the agent to CMSA retail dealers. In the case of sales of cigarettes to a chain store\nhaving 15 or more outlets, excluding vending machine operators, which\ncigarettes are delivered to a central warehouse owned and operated by such\nchain store and which are delivered by the chain store to its retail outlets, the cost of the agent shall be presumed to be the basic cost of\ncigarettes. In the case of sales of cigarettes at retail by an agent, the cost of the agent shall be the same as the cost of the CMSA retail dealer, as an agent is considered to be a CMSA retail dealer for purposes of its sales\nof cigarettes to consumers (see section\n82.5\nof this Part). (2)\n(i) The\ncost of doing business by the agent\nas used in this\nsubdivision shall mean the agent's cost of doing business as evidenced by the\naccounting standards and methods regularly employed by the agent in determining\ncosts for purposes of Federal income tax reporting for the total operation of\nthe agent's establishment. The cost of doing business must include, without\nlimitation, labor (including salaries of executives and officers), rent, depreciation, selling costs, maintenance of equipment, delivery costs, interest\npayable, all types of licenses, taxes, insurance and advertising, and must be\nexpressed as a percentage and applied to the basic cost of cigarettes. An agent\nwho wishes to use the actual cost of doing business by the agent pursuant to\nthis subparagraph in determining the cost of the agent, rather than using the\npresumptive cost of doing business by the agent pursuant to subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph, must first establish such actual cost of doing business to\nthe satisfaction of the Department of Taxation and Finance. (ii)\n\nAgent's presumptive minimum markups. In\nthe absence of filing with the Department of Taxation and Finance satisfactory\nproof of a lesser cost of doing business of the agent making the sale, the cost\nof doing business by the agent shall be presumed to be: (a) 7/8 percent (.875%) of the basic cost of\ncigarettes plus 2 cents per package of 20 cigarettes and in the case of a\npackage containing more than 20 cigarettes, 2 cents and one- half of a cent for\neach five cigarettes in excess of 20 cigarettes with respect to sales to CMSA\nwholesale dealers; (b) 1 1/2\npercent (1.5%) of the basic cost of cigarettes plus 2 cents per package of 20\ncigarettes and in the case of a package containing more than 20 cigarettes, 2\ncents and one- half of a cent for each five cigarettes in excess of 20\ncigarettes with respect to sales to chain stores; and\n(c) 3 7/8 percent (3.875%) of the basic cost\nof cigarettes plus 2 cents per package of 20 cigarettes and in the case of a\npackage containing more than 20 cigarettes, 2 cents and one- half of a cent for\neach five cigarettes in excess of 20 cigarettes with respect to sales to CMSA\nretail dealers. (3)\n\nAny fractional part of a cent in the cost\nof the agent per carton of cigarettes must be rounded off to the next higher\ncent. (4)\n\nIn accord with section\n80.2\n(a)(3)\nof this Title, the Department of Taxation and Finance will periodically publish\na separate cost of the agent for sales to CMSA wholesale dealers, for sales to\nchain stores and for sales to CMSA retail dealer based on the presumed costs of\ndoing business by the agent. Such costs will be for standard brands and may be\nused to comply with this section with respect to standard brands. (c) When, with the approval of the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, a licensed cigarette agent sells cigarettes\nto another licensed agent and such cigarettes are either picked up at the\nwarehouse of the seller or delivered to the warehouse of the purchaser, the\nagent making such sale shall not be required to include in the selling price, the cost of the agent as defined herein. However, no such sale shall be made at\na price which is less than the basic cost of cigarettes. Upon resale of such\ncigarettes (to other than a licensed agent), the agent who purchased the\ncigarettes for resale shall be deemed to be the agent governed by this\nsection.
