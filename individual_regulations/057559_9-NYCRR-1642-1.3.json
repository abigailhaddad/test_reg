  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-1.3 - Deposits\n\nState Regulations\n\nDeposits of funds received by a local agency shall be\nmade daily. Deposit tickets shall be made out in duplicate, the duplicate\nticket, stamped by the bank, being filed with the other records supporting the\ndeposits. Arrangements should be made for police protection of the project\noffice during days of heavy cash collections and for police protection between\nthe project office and the bank, of the employee making deposits which include\nsubstantial sums in cash. Consideration may be given, with division approval, to the use of armored car service where police protection is not available. In\nchoosing a depositary, consideration should be given to the facilities\nmaintained by the bank for the making of deposits during other than regular\nbanking hours. Where such facilities are available, they should be used, with\nappropriate safeguards relative to the certification and substantiation of the\namount deposited both at the project office, when the deposit is made up, and\nat the bank, when the deposit is opened and counted. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-1.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
