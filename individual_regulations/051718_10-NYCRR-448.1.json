  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 448.1 - Specifications for cost reporting periods beginning in 1980\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The cost allocation statistics and\nrequired Standard Units of Measure, except inpatient days, may be estimated\nusing statistical sampling instead of taking complete counts. Statistical\nsampling is most appropriate for those SUM's and cost allocation statistics\nwhich can be obtained from a physical record of the transaction or procedure. For example, the laundry and linen cost center might keep a log of the number\nof pounds processed daily. At the end of the year or at convenient intervals\nthrough the year, a random sample of days can be taken from the log and an\nestimate of the total pounds processed for the year can be made. It may also be\npossible to use sampling techniques for those transactions for which no record\nis kept. In this case, however, the procedures are likely to be more complex\nand costly. (b) If statistical\nsampling is to be used, it will be necessary to adhere strictly to the\nappropriate procedures. Subsequent audits may be conducted by fiscal\nintermediaries. At some time in the future, the Health Care Financing\n\nAdministration (HCFA) will publish procedures that will have wide applicability\nto a variety of items and situations. If the published procedures are not\napplicable or it is desired to use alternative methods, the hospital must be\nprepared to demonstrate that its plan adheres to the principle of scientific\nstatistical sampling. (c) Until\nsuch time as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) publishes the\nnecessary procedures mentioned above, the following methodology must be used: (1)\nA minimum of eight calendar weeks will be\nselected each year for the accumulation of data. (2)\n\nThese eight weeks will be representative\nof the full year. In order to achieve this, the hospital will select a two-week\nblock (14 consecutive days) within each fiscal quarter for the collection of\ndata. (3)\n\nThe same two-week block\nneed not be used for all statistics. (4)\n\nDuring the testing period, actual\ncounting, weighting, etc. will be done for all shifts involved in the\nparticular area. (5)\n\nPeriods of\n\"unusual\" circumstances should be avoided as test weeks. The principle of\nrepresentative samples is the ultimate goal. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n448.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
