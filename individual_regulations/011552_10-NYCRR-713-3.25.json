  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 713-3.25 - Electrical requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All\nmaterial including equipment, conductors, controls and signaling devices shall\nbe installed to provide a complete electrical system with the necessary\ncharacteristics and capacity to supply the electrical facilities shown in the\nspecifications or indicated on the plans. Materials and installation shall\nconform to NFPA 70, National Electric Code, 1999 edition and NFPA 99, Standard\nfor Health Care Facilities, 1999 edition. Further details concerning these\nreferenced materials are contained in section\n711.2\n(a) of this\n\nTitle. All electrical installations and systems shall be tested to show that\nthe equipment is installed and operates as planned or specified. (b) Circuit breakers or fusible switches that\nprovide disconnecting means and overcurrent protection for conductors connected\nto switchboards and panel boards shall be enclosed or guarded to provide a\ndeadfront type of assembly. The main switchboard shall be located in a separate\nenclosure accessible only to authorized persons. The switchboard shall be\nconvenient for use, readily accessible for maintenance, clear of traffic lanes, and in a dry ventilated space free of corrosive fumes or gases. Overload\nprotective devices shall be suitable for operating properly in ambient\ntemperature conditions. (c) Panel\nboards serving lighting and appliance circuits shall be located on the same\nfloor as the circuits they serve. This requirement does not apply to emergency\nsystem circuits. (d) All spaces\noccupied by people, machinery, equipment within buildings, approaches to\nbuildings, and parking lots shall have lighting commensurate with intended use. Residents' rooms shall have general lighting and night lighting. A reading\nlight shall be provided for each resident. At least one light fixture for night\nlighting shall be switched at the entrance to each resident room. All switches\nfor control of lighting in resident areas shall be of the quiet operating\ntype. (e) Receptacles (convenience\noutlets) shall comply with the following: (1)\n\nEach resident room shall have duplex grounding-type receptacles as follows: one\nlocated near each side of the head of each bed; one for television if used; and\none on another wall. (2)\n\nDuplex\nreceptacles for general use shall be installed approximately 50 feet apart in\nall corridors and within 25 feet of ends of corridors. (f) The electrical circuit(s) to fixed or\nportable equipment in hydrotherapy units shall be provided with five\nmilliampere ground fault interrupters. (g) Nurses' calling systems shall comply with\nthe following: (1)\n\nIn resident occupied\nareas, each room shall be served by at least one calling station and each\nresident shall be provided with a call device. Two call devices serving\nadjacent beds may be served by one calling station. Calls shall register with\nthe floor staff and shall activate a visible signal in the corridor at the\nresidents' door, in the clean workroom, in the soiled workroom, and in the\nnourishment station of the nursing unit. In multi-corridor nursing units, additional visible signals shall be installed at corridor intersections, in\nrooms containing two or more calling stations, indicating lights shall be\nprovided at each station. Nurses' calling systems that provide two-way voice\ncommunication shall be equipped with an indicating light at each calling\nstation with lights, and remain lighted as long as the voice circuit is\noperating. (2)\nA nurse's call\nemergency device shall be provided for residents' use at each residents'\ntoilet, bath and shower. (3)\n\nAlternate technologies can be considered for emergency or nurse call systems. If radio frequency systems are used, consideration should be given to\nelectromagnetic compatibility between internal and external sources. The\ndepartment will consider the use of alternate technologies on a case-by-case\nbasis and may approve the use of such technology if resident safety is\nassured. (h) Emergency\nelectric services shall comply with the following requirements: (1)\n\nTo provide electricity during an\ninterruption of the normal electric supply, an emergency source of electricity\nshall be provided and connected to certain circuits for lighting and\npower. (2)\n\nThe source of this\nemergency electric service shall be as follows: (i) an emergency generating set when the\nnormal service is supplied by one or more central station transmission lines; and\n(ii)\nan emergency generating\nset or a central station transmission line when the normal electric supply is\ngenerated on the premises. (3)\n\nEmergency electrical service shall be\nprovided to the distribution systems as follows: (i) Illumination for means of egress and for\nexit signs and exit directional signs as required in NFPA101, Life Safety Code, 2000 edition. Further details concerning this referenced material are contained\nin section\n711.2\n(a) of this\n\nTitle. (ii)\n\nCorridor duplex\nreceptacles in resident areas. (iii)\n\nNurses' calling systems. (iv)\n\nEquipment necessary for maintaining\ntelephone service. (v) Elevator\nservice that will reach every resident floor when resident rooms are located on\nother than the ground floor. Throwover facilities shall be provided to allow\ntemporary operation of any elevator for release of persons who may be trapped\nbetween floors. (vi)\nA fire pump, if installed. (vii)\n\nEquipment for\nheating resident rooms, except where the facility is served by two or more\nelectrical services supplied from separate generators of a utility distribution\nnetwork having multiple power input sources and arranged to provide mechanical\nand electrical separation so that a fault between the facility and the\ngenerating sources will not likely cause an interruption of its service\nfeeders. (viii)\n\nGeneral\nillumination and selected receptacles in the vicinity of the generator\nset. (ix)\n\nPaging or speaker systems\nif intended for communication during emergency. Radio transceivers where\ninstalled for emergency use shall be capable of operating for at least one hour\nupon total failure of both normal and emergency power. (x) Alarm systems, including fire alarms\nactivated at manual stations, water flow alarm devices of sprinkler system if\nelectrically operated, fire and smoke detecting systems, and alarms required\nfor non-flammable medical gas systems if installed. (xi)\n\nWalk-in refrigerator and\nfreezer. (xii)\n\nElectric duplex\noutlets for all resident rooms, communal areas and service areas serving\nresidents requiring ventilator care. (4)\n\nThe emergency lighting shall be in\noperation within 10 seconds after the interruption of normal electric power\nsupply. Emergency service to receptacles and equipment may be delayed automatic\nor manually connected. Receptacles connected to emergency power shall be\ndistinctively marked. When the generator is operated by fuel, which is normally\npiped underground to the site from a utility distribution system, fuel storage\nfacilities on the site will not be required. (5)\n\nEach resident sleeping room shall be\nprotected by an automatic smoke and heat detection system which includes an\napproved and operational automatic smoke and heat detector in such room. The\ndetector shall conform to the applicable provisions of NFPA 72, National Fire\n\nAlarm Code, 1999 edition.
