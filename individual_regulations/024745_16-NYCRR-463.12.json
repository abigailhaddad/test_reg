  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 463.12 - Work order system required\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\nutility shall record all changes in steam plant used wholly or partly in steam\noperations by means of a work order or job order system. The work order system\nshall include a work order estimate and a work in progress record, which shall\nbe supported as indicated below. (b) All installations, additions, retirements, or replacements shall be covered by a work order estimate and a\nwork in progress record. Standing work orders may be used by utilities with\nsteam annual operating revenues in excess of $25,000,000 for projects of less\nthan $10,000 each; by utilities with similar revenues between $5,000,000 and\n$25,000,000 for projects of less than $5,000 each; and utilities with similar\nrevenues below $5,000,000 for projects of less than $1,000 each; except that\nprojects upon which interest during construction is charged shall not be\nrecorded through standing work orders. These limits may be modified by order of\nthe commission when warranted by particular circumstances. (c) The work order estimate shall include the\nfollowing particulars: (1)\nA designation\nnumber or letter and the signature of the officer or employee who authorized\nthe work or purchase. If authorization is by the board of directors or other\nbody, the proper officer shall so state over his signature. (2)\nA description and the location of the\nwork to be done (or the purchase to be made), stating the reasons which\nnecessitated the work, and the dates between which such work (or purchase) is\nto be accomplished. For each project for which interest during construction is\ncharged, the date when completed and the date when placed in operation shall be\nshown either in the work order estimate or the work in progress\nrecord. (3)\n\nDetailed estimates of\nthe cost of the project, to be supported by maps, plans, diagrams, specifications, etc., applicable. (4)\n\nThe account or accounts to which the cost\nof the project is chargeable and the amount chargeable to each\naccount. (5)\n\nAny variations between\nestimates and actual costs of the project. (6)\n\nWhen a project involves changes in\nexisting property, either the work order estimate or the work in progress\nrecord shall show the year of installation of the property retired or otherwise\naffected and shall show or refer to other records which cover the book cost\n(estimated if not known, and the basis of the estimate to be stated) and the\nname and page of the accounting and engineering books and records covering such\ninstallation and the cost thereof. (d) The work in progress record shall contain\nthe following particulars: (1)\nA designation\nnumber or letter which shall correspond to the number or letter on the work\norder estimate covering the same project. When more than one such work in\nprogress record covers the work on a work order estimate, each shall be\nnumbered or lettered in such manner as to be readily identifiable with the work\norder estimate for the same project. (2)\n\nThe accumulated charges applicable to\neach particular job or project, the total cost of the completed project, and\nthe cost of removal shall be shown. When any project involves charges to more\nthan one steam plant account, the work in progress record shall be kept so as\nto show the amount chargeable to each account. Every charge or credit on work\nin progress records shall refer to the voucher, journal, or other source from\nwhich the entry therein was made. (3)\n\nFull details at any time of the amount\ncarried in account 103, construction work in progress, or account 144, Retirement Work in Progress, as applicable. The cost of completed projects\nshall be promptly transferred from those accounts to the accounts to which\nchargeable. Upon coming into service, completed portions involving additions to\naccounts shall be transferred to the appropriate account although other\nportions of the work covered by the same work order are not yet completed and\nthe work order has not been closed. Credits for such transfers shall be made in\nseparate column. Note A:Requirement of the use of the work order system\nhere outlined may be suspended by order of the commission in the case of a\nutility which satisfies the commission that the system which it has in use for\nrecording changes in steam plant accounts gives the equivalent detail by\naccounts in substantially the same form. The identification of expenditures\nwith property must be complete and clear, and the detail of the cost of each\nproject or job must be readily available. The total of the uncompleted projects\nmust also be in agreement with account 103, Construction Work in Progress, or\naccount 144, Retirement Work in Progress, as applicable. Note B:The work order system is required to record\nchanges in steam plant used wholly or partly in steam operations. Its use is\nrecommended, however, in recording other expenditures, such as for plant in\nother departments, repairs, etc. When used for repairs, balances applicable\nthereto shall be cleared monthly to the appropriate accounts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n463.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
