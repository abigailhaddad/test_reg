  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 4-5.5 - Gages\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Steam gage. A\nlow pressure steam boiler shall have a steam gage connected to its steam space\nor its water column, or to its steam connection, by means of a siphon or\nequivalent device exterior to the boiler and of sufficient capacity to keep the\ngage tube filled with water and so arranged that the gage cannot be shut off\nfrom the boiler except by a cock with tee or lever handle, placed in the pipe\nnear the gage. The handle of the cock shall be parallel to the pipe in which it\nis located when the cock is open. (b) Steam gage dial. (1)\n\nThe scale on the dial of a steam boiler\nsteam gage shall be evenly graduated in one pound increments from zero to not\nless than 30 psi gage pressure. (2)\n\nThe gage shall be provided with effective stops for the indicating pointer at\nthe zero point and at the maximum pressure point. The travel of the tip of the\npointer from zero to 30 psi gage pressure shall be along the scale in an arc of\n180 degrees and at least one inch radius. (3)\n\nThis requirement does not apply to dials\ninstalled before March 31, 1965 which provide equivalent or better\nlegibility. (c) Pressure\nor altitude gages. A low pressure hot water boiler shall have a pressure or\naltitude gage connected to it or to its flow connection in such a manner that\nit cannot be shut off from the boiler except by a cock with tee or lever\nhandle, placed on the pips near the gage. The handle of the cock shall be\nparallel to the pipe in which it is located when the cock is open. (d) Pressure or altitude gage dial. The scale\non the dial of the pressure or altitude gage shall be graduated to not less\nthan one and one-half times the maximum allowable working pressure. The gage\nshall be provided with effective stops for the indicating pointer at the zero\npoint and at the maximum pressure point. (e) Pressure or altitude gage connections. Pressure or altitude gage connections shall be of nonferrous composition when\nsmaller than one inch pipe size and longer than five feet between the gage and\nthe point of connection to the boiler, and also when smaller than 1/2 inch and\nshorter than five feet between the gage and the point of connection to the\nboiler. The size of any nonferrous pipe or tubing used shall be not less then\n1/4 inch. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n4-5.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
