  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 368.4 - Financial factors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Financial need. The need for public\nassistance of all persons who are aged, blind or disabled shall be determined\nin accordance with department regulations. (b) Exploration of income and resources. All\nincome and resources shall be indicated on the application form and evaluated\nas to their immediate and/or potential availability to remove or reduce need\nfor assistance and utilized for such purpose in accordance with applicable\nregulations of the department. When a clear, consistent statement of financial\nneed and resources cannot be obtained, a full field investigation by the\nvalidation staff shall be made. (1)\n\nResidents\nof private institution. When an applicant is a resident of a private non-\nprofit institution, such as a home for the aged or blind, or a home for adults, determination shall be made as to: the basis upon which he was admitted, particularly whether the home is obligated to provide care and maintenance by\nthe terms of a contract, by the provisions of the charter of the home, or by\nconditions and restrictions on gifts and bequests made to the home: resources\npossessed at admission or acquired during residence and their disposition; and\nprovision of special medical care and burial. (i) A resident is not eligible for assistance\nif and so long as the home is obligated to provide for all his needs and the\nhome is able to fulfill its obligation. If it is determined that the home is\nunable to fulfill its obligation to the resident, this obligation may, with the\napproval of the department, be considered to be suspended while the home's\ninability continues. In such instances, as well as in instances where the\nhome's obligation has terminated, as when a contract has been fully performed\nby the home or has been terminated by agreement of the parties, determination\nof eligibility shall be made as for any other applicant. This shall include\ndetermination as to whether or not resources assigned, donated or contributed\nto the home have been exhausted for the maintenance of the applicant prior to\nhis application for public assistance. (ii)\n\nFor the applicant resident in a home on\nthe basis of a non-life care contract, resources deposited with the institution\nshall be investigated to determine to what extent they have been used to meet\nthe cost of his care and to provide burial reserve. Until the resources\nexclusive of burial reserve have been exhausted on this basis, there is no\neligibility for public assistance while the applicant is a resident of the\nhome, except when his contract with the home is considered suspended. If the\napplicant had such an arrangement but has left the institution, there shall be\na determination as to any unused resources and their availability to\nhim. (2)\n\nAdmission to an\ninstitution. A social services official shall include in the exploration and\nevaluation of resources the availability and suitability of care in a private\nhome for the aged or a private institution for adults for which an applicant\nmay be eligible because of membership in a fraternal organization or other\nassociation or in a government home or institution for which an applicant may\nbe eligible because of veteran status. Since admission to such a home or\ninstitution is voluntary, this resource is not to be considered available if\nthe individual is unwilling to use such facilities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
