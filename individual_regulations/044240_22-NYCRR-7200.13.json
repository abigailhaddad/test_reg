  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 7200.13 - Payment of awards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Claimants shall be reimbursed for\nlosses in amounts to be determined by the trustees. No award shall exceed\n$300,000. (b) Awards\nshall not include interest. Attorneys' fees and other incidental out-of-pocket\nexpenses shall not be reimbursed by the fund. Additional taxes, interest, late\ncharges and similar penalties finally incurred by a claimant as the direct\nresult of an attorney's misappropriation may be eligible for reimbursement in\nthe discretion of the trustees. The investigation report in a claim which\ninvolves such an element of loss shall contain an estimate of the amount of\nsuch loss and a recommendation whether the loss merits reimbursement from the\nfund. Unless the trustees determine otherwise, payment thereof may be processed\nas a supplemental award of reimbursement without further action by the\ntrustees, provided the claimant provides proof of loss within six months\nfollowing the trustees' approval of the underlying claim. The executive\ndirector shall report quarterly to the trustees on the payment of all\nsupplemental awards during the preceding quarter. (c) No claim for reimbursement\nshall be paid until the claimant transfers to the fund, in such form as the\ntrustees shall authorize, the claimant's rights against the attorney whose\ndishonest conduct caused the claimant's loss and any other person or entity who\nmay be liable for the claimant's loss. (d) Payment of claims shall be made in\nsuch amounts and at such times as the trustees deem appropriate and may be paid\nin lump-sum or installment amounts. (e) If a claimant is a minor or an\nincompetent, the award may be paid to a parent, guardian, committee or the\nattorney of the claimant, on the behalf of and for the benefit of the\nclaimant. (f) All\npayments of awards of reimbursement from the fund shall be made by the State\n\nComptroller on vouchers certified by the chairman and the treasurer. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\n§\n7200.13\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
