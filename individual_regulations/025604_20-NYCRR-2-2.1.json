Tit. 20 §§ 2-2.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 208(9))\n(a) The accounting method or basis on which\nbusiness income is to be computed must be the same as the taxpayer's method of\naccounting for Federal income tax purposes. However, when the commissioner\ndeems it necessary in order to properly reflect the business income of the\ntaxpayer, the commissioner may determine the taxable year or period in which\nany item of income or deduction must be included, without regard to the method\nof accounting used by the taxpayer. (b) In the absence of an accounting method\nfor Federal income tax purposes, business income must be computed in accordance\nwith the method regularly employed in keeping the books of the taxpayer, provided such method properly reflects business income. If the books of a\ntaxpayer do not properly reflect business income, or if no books are kept, the\ncomputation of business income must be made in such manner as the commissioner\ndeems necessary to properly reflect business income.
