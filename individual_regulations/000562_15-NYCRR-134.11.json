  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 134.11 - Issuance of unconditional driver's license\n\nState Regulations\n\nSatisfactory completion of a rehabilitation program or\nexpiration of the term of suspension, whichever occurs first, will initiate the\nnecessary action to provide for the termination of the suspension or revocation\nwhich was the basis for entry into the rehabilitation program, provided\nhowever, no such suspension or revocation shall be terminated prior to the\nexpiration of the term of suspension or revocation if the applicant for the\nunconditional license has two or more alcohol- or drug-related driving\nconvictions or incidents within the preceding 25 years. For the purposes of\nthis section, the preceding 25 years means the period commencing upon the date\nthat is 25 years before the date of the violation that resulted in enrollment\nin the program and ending on and including the date of such violation. Upon a\ndetermination of satisfactory completion of the rehabilitation program or the\nterm of suspension, and unless otherwise determined by the commissioner, as\nprovided for in section\n134.10\n(b) of this\n\nPart, a notice of termination of the suspension or revocation and an\nunconditional license will be issued. However, no such license will be issued\nuntil all civil penalties due the department are paid or if there are any\noutstanding suspensions, revocations, or bars against such license until such\nsuspensions, revocations, or bars are satisfactorily disposed of by the\napplicant. Any conditional license which is still valid will be terminated\nconcurrently with the return of the unconditional driver's license and must be\nreturned to the department. A conditional license shall not be renewed more\nthan one year after the issuance of the conditional license if a revocation is\nissued for a chemical test refusal and the holder of the conditional license\nhas not paid the civil penalty required by section\n1194\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law.
