  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 220-3.9 - Performance Requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Emissions\ntesting shall be conducted once per permit term, or at least once every ten\nyears, for all Asphalt Mixture Processing Units subject to this Subpart. These\ntests should be completed for all fuels utilized by the Asphalt Mixture\n\nManufacturing Plant to verify compliance with the filterable and condensable\nparticulate matter (PM) and Nitrogen Oxide (NO\nx\n) limits\nfound in section 220-3.5. (1)\nPM (filterable\nand condensable) shall be measured using the emission test methods found in 40\nCFR part\n60\n\nAppendix A, Method 5 and 40 CFR part\n51, Appendix M, Method 202, or\nany other method acceptable to the department. (2)\nNO\nx\nshall be\nmeasured using the emission test methods found in 40 CFR part\n60\n\nAppendix A, Method 7, or any other method acceptable to the department. (b) The owner or operator of an\n\nAsphalt Mixture Manufacturing Plant shall comply with the following\nrequirements: (1)\n\nWithin one year of the\ncommencement of operation of any modified, new or Reconstructed Asphalt Mixture\n\nProcessing Unit at the respective site, the owner or operator shall perform an\nemission test to demonstrate compliance with the filterable and condensable PM\nand NO\nx\nemission limits specified in section 230-3.5 of\nthis Subpart. (2)\n\nAt least thirty\n(30) calendar days prior to commencing an emission test, a test protocol shall\nbe submitted to the department for review and approval. (3)\nA complete test report shall be submitted\nto the department no later than sixty (60) calendar days after completion of\nthe on-site testing portion of an emission test program. A complete test report\nshall include a summary of the emission results, clearly indicating if each\npollutant measured is within permitted limits. The testing methods shall meet\nthe acceptable procedures found in 6 NYCRR\n202-1.3\nto determine\ncompliance. (c) The\nowner or operator shall conduct a burner tuning procedure in accordance with\nthe manufacturer's specifications to minimize NO\nx\nand\ncarbon monoxide (CO) emissions each calendar y ear. (1)\n\nMonitoring records stating the following\ninformation shall be maintained on site for at least two years after issuance\nof the permit and may be stored offsite (including electronic storage)\nafterwards for the life of the permit. Access to such offsite records must be\nmade available in a timely manner if requested by the Department. (i) The date of the tuning\nprocedure; (ii)\n\nThe name of the\nservicing company /qualified internal staff/technician; (iii)\n\nThe production rate (tons/hr) or load\nbefore and after tuning; (iv)\n\nThe\nNO\nx\nand CO concentrations (ppmvd @ 3%\nO\n2\n) before and after tuning; and\n(v) The percent O\n2\nbefore and after tuning. (d) In the event the emissions testing\ndescribed in subparagraph 3.9(a) above demonstrates that the emission limits\nhave not been met, and no feasible technological alternative exists to achieve\nsuch limits, the department may require the owner or operator of an Asphalt\n\nMixture Manufacturing Plant to perform an air dispersion modeling analysis\nusing procedures acceptable to the department to determine compliance at the\nproperty line.
