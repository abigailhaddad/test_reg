(4)\n\nClean coal technology\ndemonstration project. A project using funds appropriated under the heading\n\"Department of Energy-Clean Coal Technology,\" for commercial demonstration of\nclean coal technology, or similar projects funded through appropriations for\nthe Environmental Protection Agency. (5)\n\nBegin actual construction. Begin actual\nconstruction shall mean in general, initiation of physical on-site construction\nactivities which are of a permanent nature. Such activities include, but are\nnot limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying of\nunderground pipework, and construction of permanent storage structures. With\nrespect to a change in method of operating this term refers to those on-site\nactivities other than preparatory activities which mark the initiation of the\nchange. (6)\n\nCommence construction. Commence construction shall mean that the owner or operator has all necessary\npreconstruction approvals or permits and either has: (i) begun, or caused to begin, a continuous\nprogram of actual on-site construction, to be completed within a reasonable\ntime; or\n(ii)\nentered into binding\nagreements or contractual obligations, which cannot be canceled or modified\nwithout substantial loss to the owner or operator, to undertake a program of\nactual construction to be completed within a reasonable time. (7)\n\nCommence operation. Commence\noperation shall mean: (i) the date that a\nproposed source project or proposed major facility first increases emissions of\nany nonattainment contaminant to which this Subpart applies; or\n(ii)\nthe date after an appropriate shakedown\nperiod, for a proposed source project or proposed major facility which is a\nfunctional replacement for another emission source(s) or unit(s) (for example, a cogeneration plant replacing an existing boiler house) and which proposes to\nuse ERCs generated from the replaced sources or units to the maximum extent\npossible. This shakedown period shall not exceed 180 days and shall be\nspecified in a permit for the replacement source or unit. (8)\n\nComplete permit application. Complete\npermit application means a permit application which is complete in accordance\nwith the provision of Part 621 of this Title. (9)\n\nContemporaneous. Contemporaneous time\nperiods are: (i) in the severe ozone\nnonattainment area, for emissions of VOC or NO\nx\nonly, the five consecutive calendar year period which ends with the calendar year\nthat the proposed source project is scheduled to commence operation, as stated\nby the applicant in a permit application; and\n(ii)\nfor emissions of VOC or NO\nx\nin all other ozone nonattainment areas and attainment\nportions of the ozone transport region, and for emissions of PM-10 or CO in\ntheir respective nonattainment areas, the period which begins five years prior\nto the scheduled commence construction date, and ends with the scheduled\ncommence operation date, each such date for a proposed source project being as\nstated by the applicant in a permit application. (10)\n\nCreditable emission increase. Any\nincrease in emissions of a nonattainment contaminant in tons per year from an\nemission unit at an existing facility, other than such an increase from a\nproposed source project, which: (i) results\nfrom a physical change in, or a change in the method of operation of, an\nemission unit; and\n(ii)\nis\nquantified as the difference, except as provided in subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph, between prior actual annual emissions or prior allowable annual\nemissions, whichever is less, and the subsequent maximum annual potential; and\n(iii)\nfor an electric utility\nsteam generating unit, is quantified as the difference between prior actual\nannual emissions or prior allowable annual emissions, whichever is less, and\nthe subsequent representative actual annual emissions. (11)\n\nCurtailment. An enforceable permit\ncondition formally restricting operation of an emission unit at an existing\nfacility which results in an emission reduction and reflects a partial\nreduction in hours of operation or capacity utilization. (12)\n\nElectric utility steam generating unit. Any emission unit (exclusive of a new emission unit or replacement of an\nexisting emission unit) constructed for the purpose of supplying more than\none-third of its potential electric output capacity and more than 25 megawatts\nof electrical output to any utility power distribution system for sale. Any\nsteam supplied to a steam distribution system for the purpose of providing\nsteam to a steam-electric generator that would produce electrical energy for\nsale is also considered in determining the electrical energy output\ncapacity. (13)\n\nEmission offset. ERCs which: (i) equal or exceed the project\nemission potential or facility emission potential of a proposed source project\nor proposed major facility, respectively, to which the reductions must be\napplied; and\n(ii)\nmeet the\nrequirements of section\n231-2.9\nof this Subpart. (14)\n\nEmission reduction credit, ERC. Any decrease in emissions of a nonattainment contaminant in tons per year, occurring on or after November 15, 1990: (i) which is surplus, quantifiable, permanent, and enforceable; and\n(ii)\nwhich results from a physical change in, or a change in the method of operation of an emission unit subject to Part 201\nof this Title; and\n(a) is quantified as the\ndifference between prior actual annual emissions or prior allowable annual\nemissions, whichever is less, and the subsequent maximum annual potential; and\n(b) is certified in accordance\nwith the provisions of section\n231-2.6\nof this Subpart; or\n(iii)\nwhich results\nfrom a physical change in, or a change in the method of operation of an air\ncontamination source not subject to Part 201 of this Title, and is certified in\naccordance with the provisions of section\n231-2.6\nof this Subpart. (15)\n\nEmission unit shutdown.

(16)\n\nEnforceable. All\npermit limitations and conditions or other legally binding emission limitations\nwhich are enforceable by both the department and the administrator of the\n\nUnited States Environmental Protection Agency. Directly measurable limitations\non the allowable capacity of equipment, requirements for installation, operation, and maintenance of air pollution control equipment, limits on hours\nof operation, and restrictions on amounts of materials combusted, stored, or\nproduced may be considered as enforceable. General limitations on facility\nemission potential or maximum annual potential, such as yearly limits, by\nthemselves are not enforceable by the administrator. (17)\n\nFacility emission potential. The maximum\npotential in tons per year of a facility to emit a nonattainment contaminant\nexpressed as the sum of: (i) the maximum\nannual potential, on a contaminant specific basis, of each emission unit at the\nfacility; and\n(ii)\nfugitive\nemissions to the extent they are quantifiable, of the corresponding\nnonattainment contaminant for any facility which belongs to one of the 28\nsource categories listed in section\n231-2.2\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, but not including secondary emissions. However, once a facility is\ndetermined to be major and is subject to this Subpart, fugitive emissions must\nbe included in the total emissions from the facility for subsequent permitting\npurposes (such as air quality analyses, offsets, etc.), regardless of whether\nthe facility belongs to one of the 28 source categories listed in section\n231-2.2\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart. (18)\n\nFacility\nshutdown. The permanent removal from service of all emission units at a\nfacility, as reflected by enforceable permit conditions formally prohibiting\nthe emission units from further operation. (19)\n\nFuture reductions. Reductions which are\nscheduled to occur subsequent to the issuance/modification of the permit for\nthe proposed source project or proposed major facility using these\nreductions. (20)\n\nInternal offset. ERCs of VOC or NO\nx, in the severe ozone nonattainment\narea only, from emission units within the same existing major facility as a\nproposed source project, which physically occur on or after November 15, 1990. Such reductions shall meet the requirements of section\n231-2.8\nof this Subpart. (21)\n\nMajor facility. A facility with a\nfacility emission potential of a nonattainment contaminant which equals or\nexceeds the corresponding major facility size threshold in section 231-2.12 or\n231-2.13\nof this Subpart. (22)\n\nMaximum annual potential. The maximum\nannual capacity in tons per year of an emission unit to emit a nonattainment\ncontaminant. Maximum annual potential shall: (i) be determined after control equipment has\nbeen applied using the maximum enforceable permissible emission rate; and\n(ii)\nbe based on continuous\noperation for 8,760 hours per year at maximum capability under the emission\nunit's physical and operational design, unless limited by enforceable permit\nconditions; and\n(iii)\nnot include\neither secondary emissions or fugitive emissions. (23)\n\nNet emission increase. The aggregate\nincrease in emissions of a nonattainment contaminant in tons per year at an\nexisting major facility resulting from the sum of: (i) the project emission potential of a\nproposed source project at the facility; and\n(ii)\nevery creditable emission increase at\nthe facility which is contemporaneous with the proposed source project and for\nwhich an emission offset was not obtained or, in the severe ozone nonattainment\narea, for which an internal offset was not obtained; and\n(iii)\nany ERC at the facility, or portion\nthereof, selected by the applicant which is contemporaneous with the proposed\nsource project and which was not previously used as part of an emission offset\nor an internal offset. (24)\n\nNonattainment contaminant. A contaminant\nemitted by an emission unit located or proposed to be located in an area\ndesignated in Part 200 of this Title as nonattainment for that contaminant. Because all of New York State is within the ozone transport region, VOC and NO\nx\nare treated as nonattainment contaminants\nstatewide. (25)\n\nOffset ratio. The\nratio of a required ERC, on a nonattainment contaminant specific basis, to the\nproject emission potential or the facility emission potential of a proposed\nsource project or proposed major facility, respectively. Offset ratios are\nlisted in sections 231-2.12 and\n231-2.13\nof this Subpart. (26)\n\nPast reductions. Reductions which have\nphysically occurred on or after November 15, 1990. (27)\n\nPermanent. Permanent relative to an ERC\nfrom an emission unit means that the reduction is irreversible through the life\nof the emission unit. (28)\n\nPermit\naction. Permit action means: (i) for any\nemission unit subject to Part 201 of this Title, a determination of complete\npermit application for issuance or modification of an enforceable permit\nrepresenting that emission unit; (ii)\nfor any major electric generating\nfacility subject to article X of the Public Service Law, or any major steam\nelectric generating facility subject to article VIII of the Public Service Law, the setting of a date for a hearing by the chairperson of a New York State\nboard on electric generation siting and the environment for such a\nfacility. (29)\n\nPollution\ncontrol project. Any project undertaken at an existing emission unit which, as\nits primary purpose, reduces emissions of any nonattainment contaminant from\nsuch unit. Such projects do not include the replacement of an existing emission\nsource or unit with a newer or different source or unit, or the reconstruction\nof an existing emission source or unit, and are limited to any of the\nfollowing: (i) flue gas recirculation, low NO\nx\nburners, selective catalytic reduction or selective\nnon-catalytic reduction for NO\nx; (ii)\nthermal oxidizers, catalytic oxidizers, condensers, thermal incinerators, scrubbers, flares, carbon adsorbers, or\nprojects involving combustion of landfill gas using boilers, gas turbines, internal combustion engines, cleaning/gas treatment facilities or combinations\nof these for VOC; (iii)\nelectrostatic precipitators, baghouses, high efficiency multi clones, or\nscrubbers for PM-10; (iv)\nprojects\nundertaken to accommodate switching to an inherently less polluting fuel, including but not limited to, natural gas or coal reburning, or the cofiring of\nnatural gas and other inherently less polluting fuels, for the purpose of\ncontrolling emissions, and including any activity that is necessary to\naccommodate switching to an inherently less polluting fuel; (v) pollution prevention projects which the\ndepartment has determined to be environmentally beneficial. Pollution\nprevention means any activity that through process changes, product\nreformulation or redesign, or substitution of less polluting raw materials, eliminates or reduces the emissions of any nonattainment contaminant (including\nfugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal; it does not\nmean recycling (other than certain \"in-process recycling\" practices), energy\nrecovery, treatment or disposal; and\n(vi)\ninstallation of a technology for\nreducing emissions of any nonattainment contaminant, which is not listed in\nsubparagraphs (i) through (v) of this paragraph but meets the following: (a) its effectiveness in reducing emissions\nhas been demonstrated in practice; and\n(b) it is determined by the department to be\nenvironmentally beneficial. (30)\n\nPrior actual annual emissions. The\naverage rate in tons per year at which an emission unit actually emitted a\nnonattainment contaminant during the baseline period, exclusive of any periods\nof noncompliance. During noncompliance periods, the permissible emissions for\nthe emission unit shall be used in computing the average rate. Computation of\nprior actual annual emissions shall: (i) for\nan emission unit at any facility subject to Subpart 202-2 of this Title, be\nbased on the emission statements for the facility, to the extent that the\nstatements provide sufficient information specific to the emission unit; or\n(ii)\nfor an emission unit at a\nfacility not subject to Subpart 202-2 of this Title, or where an emission\nstatement does not provide sufficient information specific to the emission\nunit, be based on the criteria set forth in sections 202-2.3 and\n202-2.4\nof this Title. Use of the\nabove criteria for an emission unit at a facility not otherwise subject to\n\nSubpart 202-2 of this Title shall not make the facility subject to Subpart\n202-2 of this Title. (31)\n\nPrior allowable annual emissions. The\nmaximum rate in tons per year, during the baseline period, at which an emission\nunit would have emitted a nonattainment contaminant at the most stringent\napplicable State or Federal emission limitation established in a regulation or\na federally enforceable permit condition. (32)\n\nProject emission potential. (i) Except for an electric utility steam\ngenerating unit, project emission potential of a proposed source project shall\nconsider only proposed increases in emissions of a nonattainment contaminant\nand shall equal the sum of the following: (a) for new emission units, the maximum annual potential of each such emission\nunit; and\n(b) for existing emission\nunits, the difference between prior actual annual emissions or prior allowable\nannual emissions, whichever is less, and the subsequent maximum annual\npotential of each such emission unit. (ii)\n\nFor an electric utility steam generating\nunit, the project emission potential following a physical or operational change\nshall equal the difference between prior actual annual emissions or prior\nallowable annual emissions, whichever is less, and representative actual annual\nemissions of the unit. Such computation shall be allowed provided the source\nowner or operator maintains and submits data demonstrating to the department's\nsatisfaction that the actual annual emissions of the unit does not exceed its\nrepresentative actual annual emissions. Such date must be submitted on an\nannual basis for a period of five years from the date the unit resumes regular\noperation. A longer period, not to exceed 10 years, may be required if the\ndepartment determines such period to be more representative of normal emission\nunit post-change operations. (iii)\n\nProject emission potential does not include secondary emissions. (iv)\n\nAt an existing major facility, fugitive\nemissions are not included in determining whether the project emission\npotential exceeds the significant source project threshold in section 231-2.12\nor\n231-2.13\nof this Subpart unless the\nfacility belongs to one of the 28 source categories listed in section 231-\n2.2(c) of this Subpart. (v) At an\nexisting major facility, regardless of whether the facility belongs to one of\nthe 28 source categories listed in section\n231-2.2\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, once the project emission potential of a proposed source project is\ndetermined to exceed the significant source project threshold in section 231-\n2.12 or 231-2.13 of this Subpart without including fugitive emissions, the\nproject emission potential must include fugitive emissions, to the extent they\nare quantifiable, for subsequent permitting purposes (such as air quality\nanalyses, offsets, etc.). (33)\n\nQuantifiable. In terms of emission\nreductions, quantifiable means that a reliable basis must exist for calculating\nthe amount and the rate of the reduction, along with a description of the\ncharacteristics of the reduction. The same method should be used to quantify\nemissions before and after the reduction. (34)\n\nReasonable further progress. Annual\nincremental reductions in emissions of a nonattainment contaminant required by\napplicable regulations and implementation plans to ensure timely attainment of\nthe corresponding national ambient air quality standard. (35)\n\nRepowering. Replacement of an existing\ncoal fired boiler with one of the following clean coal technologies: atmospheric or pressurized fluidized bed combustion, integrated gasification\ncombined cycle, magnetohydrodynamics, direct and indirect coal fired turbines, integrated gasification fuel cells, or as determined by the administrator of\nthe EPA, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, a derivative of one or\nmore of these technologies, and any other technology capable of controlling\nmultiple combustion emissions simultaneously with improved boiler or generation\nefficiency and with significantly greater waste reduction relative to the\nperformance of technology in widespread commercial use as of November 15, 1990. Repowering shall also include any oil and/or gas fired unit which has been\nawarded clean coal technology demonstration funding as of January 1, 1991 by\nthe United States Department of Energy. (36)\n\nRepresentative actual annual emissions. The average rate, in tons per year, at which an electric utility steam\ngenerating unit is projected to emit a nonattainment contaminant for the two\nyear period after a physical change or a change in the method of operation of\nthe unit considering the effect any such change will have on increasing or\ndecreasing the hourly emission rate and on projected capacity utilization. A\ndifferent consecutive two-year period within 10 years after that change may be\nused, if the applicant demonstrates to the department's satisfaction that such\nperiod is more representative of normal source operations. In evaluating\nprojections of future emissions, the department shall: (i) consider all relevant information, including but not limited to, historical operational data, the applicant's own\nrepresentations, filings with the Department of Public Service, State Energy\n\nBoard, or Federal authorities, and compliance plans under title IV of the Clean\n\nAir Act Amendments of 1990 (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title); and\n(ii)\nexclude, in calculating any increase in\nemissions that results from the change, that portion of the unit's emissions\nfollowing the change that could have been accommodated during the\nrepresentative baseline period and is attributable to an increase in projected\ncapacity utilization at the unit that is unrelated to the change, including any\nincreased utilization due to the rate of electricity demand growth for the\nutility system as a whole. (37)\n\nSecondary emissions. Emissions of a\nnonattainment contaminant which occur as a result of the construction or\noperation of a proposed source project or proposed major facility, not\nincluding emissions from the proposed source project or proposed major facility\nitself. Secondary emissions shall be specific, well defined, quantifiable, and\nimpact the same general area as the proposed source project or proposed major\nfacility which causes the secondary emissions. Secondary emissions include\nnonattainment contaminant emissions from any offsite support facility which\nwould not be constructed or increase its emissions except as a result of the\nconstruction or operation of the proposed source project or proposed major\nfacility. Secondary emissions do not include any emissions which come directly\nfrom a mobile source subject to any regulation under this Title, such as\nemissions from a motor vehicle or a train. Secondary emissions shall not be\nconsidered in an applicability determination for a proposed source project or\nproposed major facility. (38)\n\nSignificant net emission increase. A net emission increase at an existing major\nfacility: (i) of VOC or NO\nx, in the severe ozone nonattainment area only, which\nexceeds 25 tons per year (see significant net emission increase threshold in\nsection\n231-2.12\nof this Subpart); or\n(ii)\nof VOC or NO\nx, in all other ozone nonattainment areas and attainment\nportions of the ozone transport region, or of PM-10 or CO in their respective\nnonattainment areas, which equals or exceeds the corresponding significant net\nemission increase threshold in section 231-2.12 or\n231-2.13\nof this Subpart. (39)\n\nSignificant source project. A\nproposed source project at an existing major facility with: (i) a project emission potential of VOC or NO\nx, in the severe ozone nonattainment area only, which\nequals or exceeds 2.5 tons per year (see significant source project threshold\nin section\n231-2.12\nof this Subpart); or\n(ii)\na project emission\npotential of VOC or NO\nx\nin all other ozone\nnonattainment areas and attainment portions of the ozone transport region, or a\nproject emission potential of PM-10 or CO in their respective nonattainment\nareas, which equals or exceeds the corresponding significant source project\nthreshold in section 231-2.12 or\n231-2.13\nof this Subpart. (40)\n\nSource project. Any of the\nfollowing proposed projects at an existing facility which results in an\nincrease in emissions of a nonattainment contaminant but does not include any\nemission reductions: (i) a new emission unit\n(replacement of an emission unit with similar equipment is addressed under\nsubparagraph [ii] of this paragraph); or\n(ii)\na physical change in, or change in the\nmethod of operation of, an emission unit which results in an increase in the\nmaximum annual potential of the emission unit; or\n(iii)\nmultiples or combinations of the above\nwhich are related actions and are included in, dependent on, or undertaken as a\nresult of any long range plan of which each such emission unit is a\npart. (41)\n\nSource\nreduction. Any practice, other than facility shutdown, emission unit shutdown, curtailment, or over control of emissions beyond an applicable limit, which\nreduces emissions of a nonattainment contaminant. Examples of source reduction\nwould be reformulation of inks, paints, coatings, etc., which result in\nreductions beyond levels required by the most stringent applicable State or\n\nFederal emission limitation, or replacement at the same location, or contiguous\nlocations, of a unit with another unit which emits less to perform the same\ntask, or replacement or repair of valves, fittings, or other equipment to\nreduce fugitive emissions. (42)\n\nSurplus. A reduction in emissions beyond levels prescribed by the most\nstringent applicable State or Federal emission limitation which is required by\nthe CAAA. (43)\n\nTemporary clean coal\ntechnology demonstration project. A clean coal technology demonstration project\nthat is operated for a period of five years or less, and which complies with\nall requirements of the State Implementation Plan (SIP) and this Chapter, and\nany others necessary to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality\nstandards during the project and after it is terminated.
