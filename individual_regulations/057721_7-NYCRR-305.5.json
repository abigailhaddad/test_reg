  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 305.5 - Closing cell hatch covers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In\nthose SHU cells which have only one solid door, vision panels will be\nmaintained with the hatch coverings in an opened position, unless a deprivation\norder is issued. A deprivation order to close such hatch coverings may be\nissued for good cause, including but not limited to the reasons listed below\nwhich warrant their being closed: (1)\n\nThe\nthrowing of feces, urine, food, or other objects through the aforementioned\nopenings. (2)\n\nThe inmate refuses to\nkeep his/her hands within the cell and/or otherwise attempts to assault or\nharass staff. (3)\n\nThe inmate is so\ndisruptive as to adversely affect the proper operation of the unit. (b) Hatch coverings may be closed\ntemporarily on all cells when it is necessary to move an inmate for other than\nroutine reasons, e.g., when an inmate is being disruptive during movement or\nuse of a chemical agent is necessary or anticipated. (c) Feed-up hatches shall remain closed\nexcept during feed-up activities or when it is necessary to open the hatches to\npass items to or from the inmate. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n305.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
