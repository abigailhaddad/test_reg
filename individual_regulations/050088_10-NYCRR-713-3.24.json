  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 713-3.24 - Mechanical systems and equipment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prior to completion and acceptance of the\nfacility, all mechanical systems shall be tested, balanced and operated to\ndemonstrate to the licensed operator or owner or his or her representative that\nthe installation and performance of these systems conform to the requirements\nof the approved plans and specifications. Upon completion of the contract, the\nowner and licensed operator shall be furnished with a complete set of\nmanufacturers' operating, maintenance, and preventive maintenance instructions, parts lists with numbers and descriptions for each piece of equipment. The\nlicensed operator shall obtain instructions on the operation of systems and\nequipment as required. (b) Thermal\ninsulation and acoustical insulation (if applicable) shall be provided on the\nfollowing fixtures and equipment in the nursing home facility and shall comply\nwith the following: (1)\nboilers, smoke\nbreeching and stacks; (2)\nsteam\nsupply and condensate return piping; (3)\nhot water piping above 180° F and all hot\nwater heaters, generators and converters; (4)\nhot water piping above 125° F which is\nexposed to contact by residents; (5)\nchilled water, refrigerant, other process\npiping and equipment operating with fluid temperatures below ambient dew\npoint; (6)\nwater supply and\ndrainage piping on which condensation may occur; (7)\nair ducts and casings with outside\nsurface temperatures below ambient dew point; and\n(8)\nother piping, ducts, and equipment as\nnecessary to maintain the efficiency of the system; (9)\ninsulation may be omitted from hot water\nand steam condensate piping not subject to contact by residents when such\ninsulation is unnecessary for preventing excessive system heat loss or\nexcessive heat gain. (c) Steam and hot water systems shall comply with the following: (1)\n\nBoilers shall have the capacity to supply\nthe normal requirements of all systems and equipment. Boilers shall have the\ncapacity, based on the net ratings published by the Hydronics Institute or\nanother generally accepted national standard approved by the commissioner, which is adequate to assure resident safety and comfort, to supply not less\nthan 70 percent of the normal requirements of all systems and equipment. Their\nnumber and arrangements shall accommodate facility needs despite the breakdown\nor routine maintenance of any one boiler. The capacity of the remaining\nboiler(s) shall be sufficient to provide hot water service for clinical, dietary, and resident use; steam for dietary purposes, and heating for general\nresident rooms. However, reserve capacity for facility space heating is not\nrequired in geographic areas where a design dry-bulb temperature of 25° F (-4°\nC) or more represents not less than 99 percent of the total hours in any one\nheating month. (2)\n\nBoiler feed\npumps, heating circulating pumps, condensate return pumps and fuel oil pumps\nshall be connected and installed to provide normal and standby\nservice. (3)\n\nSupply and return\nmains and risers of cooling, heating and process steam systems shall be valved\nto isolate the various sections of each system. Each piece of equipment shall\nbe valved at the supply and return ends. (d) Heating, cooling and ventilating systems\nfor resident occupied areas of the facility shall comply with the following\nminimum standards except where other minimum standards are shown on Table 8 of\nthis subdivision: (1)\n\nHeating systems shall\nprovide for a minimum temperature of 75° F at design temperature. Cooling\nsystems shall be designed to permit a maximum temperature of 80° F at design\ntemperature. (2)\n\nAll air-supply and\nair-exhaust systems shall be mechanically operated. All fans serving exhaust\nsystems shall be located at the discharge end of the system. The ventilation\nrates shown in Table 8 of this subdivision shall be considered as minimum\nacceptable rates and shall not be construed as precluding the use of higher\nventilation rates provided such higher rates do not result in undesirable air\nvelocity in resident-use areas. (i) Outdoor\nair intakes shall be located as far as practical, but not less than 25 feet, from exhaust outlets of ventilating systems, combustion equipment stacks, medical-surgical vacuum systems, plumbing vent stacks, or from areas which may\ncollect vehicular exhaust and other noxious fumes. The bottom of outdoor air\nintakes serving central systems shall be located as high as practical but not\nless than six feet above ground level, or if installed above the roof, three\nfeet above roof level. (ii)\n\nThe\nventilation systems shall be designed and balanced to provide the pressure\nrelationship as shown in Table 8 of this section (below).
