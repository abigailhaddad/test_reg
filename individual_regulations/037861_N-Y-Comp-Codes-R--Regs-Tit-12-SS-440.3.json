(b) Each independent pharmacy or\npharmacy chain designated under this Part must maintain a sufficient inventory\nsuch that it may service claimants without undue delay. Each designated\npharmacy must either: (1)\nbe a remote\npharmacy; or\n(2)\nbe open for\nbusiness hours that are regular and customary in the community. (c) A claimant shall not be\nrequired to obtain medications from a designated pharmacy: (1)\nprior to receiving the individual notice\nand identifying documents required by section\n440.4\nof this Part; or\n(2)\nafter receipt of the notice required by\nsubdivision (d) of this section; or\n(3)\nif no designated pharmacy is a remote\npharmacy or one that delivers to the claimant, and no designated pharmacy is\nlocated within 15 miles of the claimant's place of residence or employment if\nthe claimant resides in a rural area or within five miles of the claimant's\nplace of residence or employment if the claimant resides in a municipality\nwhich is an incorporated city or village having a population of 2,500 or more; or\n(4)\na medical emergency occurs\nand it is not reasonably possible to obtain immediately required prescribed\nmedicine from a designated pharmacy. It shall be deemed a medical emergency\nwhen: (i) a medical provider directs a\nclaimant to take a medication by a certain time, and such medication cannot be\nobtained prior to that time via a remote pharmacy; (ii)\nno designated pharmacies are located\nwithin the distance from claimant's residence or employment set forth in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision; and\n(iii)\nthe medication obtained is not a\nrefill, or the claimant was not otherwise aware of his or her need to take the\nmedication within sufficient time to obtain it via a remote pharmacy. (d) In any claim\ncontroverted by the self-insured employer or insurance carrier pursuant to\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law section 25(2) or after an initial claim has been\naccepted, but the self-insured employer or insurance carrier has filed or will\nfile a legal objection to the prescription medication contending that the\nmedication treats a non-established body site or that the self-insured employer\nor insurance carrier has not accepted liability for the body site or condition, and where the self-insured employer or insurance carrier will not reimburse the\ndesignated independent pharmacy, pharmacy chain, or pharmacy benefits manager\nfor prescription medicines dispensed to the claimant until the controversy is\nresolved and the claim established, or until the legal objection is resolved, the self-insured employer or insurance carrier shall provide notice of this\ndecision in writing to the claimant, the board, and the independent pharmacy, pharmacy chain, or pharmacy benefit manager it has designated that either the\nright to compensation is controverted or that it will not be paying for the\nprescribed medication pending resolution of such legal objection. Such notice\nshall be in the format prescribed by the chair, which may be electronic. Upon\nreceipt of such notice, the claimant may elect to use a pharmacy not designated\npursuant to this Part during the period that the claim is controverted or the\nlegal objection to payment is pending. Prior to the filing of such prescribed\nnotice and service upon the claimant, the pharmacy must dispense the prescribed\nmedication to the claimant and the insurance carrier or self-insured employer\nwill be responsible for the cost (as set forth in section\n440.5\nof this Part) of medications\nfrom, as applicable, Phase A, B or the Perioperative section of the Pharmacy\n\nFormulary. (1)\n\nFailure of the designated\npharmacy to dispense and/or failure of the self-insured employer or insurance\ncarrier to pay for such prescribed medications prior to providing such notice\nshall subject the self-insured employer or insurance carrier, following a\nhearing, to penalties under section\n114-a (3)\nof the Workers' Compensation Law\nof at least two-thousand dollars, with increased penalties thereafter for any\nsubsequent failures to dispense. (2)\n\nIn the event the claimant prevails and the claim is established or the legal\nobjection is resolved in favor of the provider, the self-insured employer or\ninsurance carrier shall reimburse either: (i) the claimant, the pharmacy processing agent, or other third party that has made\npayment for such medication; or\n(ii)\nthe pharmacy from which the claimant has obtained such medication where the\npharmacy has not received payment from the claimant, the pharmacy processing\nagent, or any third party. Such reimbursement shall not exceed the maximum\namount set by the fee schedule for controverted claims in section\n440.5\nof this Part. In the event\nthe selfinsured employer or insurance carrier prevails, it shall have no\nobligation to reimburse the claimant, the pharmacy processing agent, or any\nthird party that paid for such medication, or pharmacy. Nothing in these\nregulations shall bar the pharmacy or pharmacy processing agent or other\nthird-party payor from seeking payment or reimbursement from the claimant if\nthe claim is not established as otherwise permitted by\nlaw. (e) For\npurposes of this part, no remote pharmacy may offer purchases solely by email\nor online, but must provide an option to make purchases by telephone and mail\norder. (f) Where a claim is\napportioned between more than one self-insured employer or insurance carrier, the claimant may select among pharmacies designated under this Part by all such\nself-insured employers or insurance carriers liable for apportionment. If any\nsuch self-insured employers or insurance carriers have not designated any\nindependent pharmacies, pharmacy chains, or pharmacy benefit manager under this\n\nPart, the claimant is not bound by any designation made under this\n\nPart. (g) Any rebates or\nthird-party revenue related to drugs dispensed through a contract for pharmacy\nbenefit management and delivered to the designated pharmacy shall be passed\nthrough in full to the insurance carrier or self-insured employer in accordance\nwith contract terms that document the methodology for such transactions. Carriers shall offset bills to insured employers by the amount of any\npassed-through rebate and third-party revenue. Such rebates and third-party\nrevenue shall be reported at least annually to the carrier or self-insured\nemployer and reported by the carrier or self-insured employer to the Chair upon\nrequest.
