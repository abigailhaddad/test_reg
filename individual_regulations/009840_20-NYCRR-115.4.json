  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 115.4 - Partners and shareholders of S corporations\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 615(e)\n(a) Partners. Where a resident individual is a member of a partnership\nand such individual determines New York taxable income by using itemized\ndeductions, then such individual's share of any partnership items of deduction\ncovered by any of the provisions of section\n615 (c) and (d)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw and as further specified in sections\n115.2\nand\n115.3\nof this Part is also subject to modification. The amount of the modification\nshould be computed by the partner in accordance with the rules contained in\nsection\n117.3\nof this Article. In such case, the partner should combine such partner's share\nof each modification of a partnership deduction with any corresponding\nmodification applicable to such partner's individual Federal itemized\ndeductions. This treatment of partnership modifications is different from the\ntreatment of estate and trust modifications, which are all combined into a\nsingle net figure, called the New York fiduciary adjustment, as provided in\nsection\n119.1\nof this Article. (b) Shareholders of S corporations. (1)\n\nWhere a resident individual is a shareholder of an S corporation for which the\nelection to be treated as a New York S corporation under section\n660 (a)\nof the Tax Law is in\neffect, or is a shareholder of an S corporation that cannot make the election\nprovided for under section\n660 (a)\nof the Tax Law\n(\ne.g., a foreign S corporation [\ni.e., an S\ncorporation that is not incorporated in New York State] that does not do\nbusiness in New York State, or an S corporation that is taxed under article 9\nof the Tax Law), and such individual determines New York taxable income by\nusing itemized deductions, then such individual shareholder's share of any S\ncorporation items of deduction covered by any of the provisions of sections\n615 (c) and (d)\nof the Tax Law and sections\n115.2\nand\n115.3\nof this Part, is also subject to modification. The amount of the modification\nshould be computed by the shareholder in accordance with section\n617 (a)\nof the Tax Law. In\nsuch case, the resident individual shareholder should combine the share of each\nmodification of an S corporation deduction with any corresponding modification\napplicable to such shareholder's individual Federal itemized deductions. This\ntreatment of S corporation modifications is different from the treatment of\nestate and trust modifications, which are all combined into a single net\nfigure, called the New York fiduciary adjustment, as provided in section\n119.1\nof this Article. (2)\nA resident\nindividual shareholder of a foreign S corporation (\ni.e., an S\ncorporation that is not incorporated in New York State) that does business in\n\nNew York State, or an S corporation incorporated in New York State, either of\nwhich can make the election provided for by section\n660 (a)\nof the Tax Law but\ndoes not, is not subject to the provisions of this subdivision. The shareholder\nwould be required to make the modification required by section\n615 (c)(6)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (3)\n\nIn the case of a New York\nS termination year (see section 208.1-A of the Tax Law), the amount of the\nmodifications referred to in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision must be\ndetermined in accordance with the provisions of section\n612 (s)\nof the Tax Law and\nsection\n112.12\nof this Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n115.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
