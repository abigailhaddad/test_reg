Such schedule shall state the assumptions used to calculate\nsuch amounts and shall contain a certification that such assumptions are\nreasonable. The issuer shall also deliver to the State Comptroller on such date\na schedule setting forth the amount required to be on deposit in the sinking\nfund account in each year from the date of issuance of the bonds until their\nmaturity, which amount shall be calculated as described in paragraph c of\nsection\n22.10\nof the Local Finance\n\nLaw.

(c) Contributions to sinking funds for\nsinking fund bonds which are not subject to mandatory redemption shall be\nscheduled to be made on such day or days as may be agreed upon by the State\n\nComptroller and the issuer.
