(b) A provider's participation in the program\nmay be terminated, suspended or restricted for a reasonable period of time if\nthe department finds that the provider has engaged in an unacceptable practice\nas set forth in Part 515 of this Title. A provider whose participation is so\nterminated, suspended or restricted is entitled to notice and an opportunity to\nbe heard in accordance with Part 515 of this Title. (c) A provider's participation is\nautomatically terminated or suspended as of the date of the provider's\nsuspension or termination from Medicare. A notice confirming the termination or\nsuspension will be sent to the provider. (d) (1)\nA\nprovider's participation in the medical assistance program is automatically\nterminated as of the date of any termination, revocation or suspension of a\nlicense to practice a medical profession, or the termination, revocation or\nsuspension of any registration, certification, license or other approval\nrequired to provide medical care, services or supplies under the medical\nassistance program. However, a provider of intermediate care facility services\nfor the developmentally disabled, licensed or operated by the Office of Mental\n\nRetardation and Developmental Disabilities, whose participation in the medical\nassistance program is terminated by the department because the provider no\nlonger meets the requirements for participation or whose participation in such\nprogram is not renewed upon expiration of its provider agreement with the\ndepartment, remains eligible to participate in the program if the Department of\n\nHealth certifies that the provider's continuation in the medical assistance\nprogram will not jeopardize a medical assistance recipient's health and safety\nand the provider has requested an administrative evidentiary hearing which is\nheld after the effective date of termination or nonrenewal or is held before\nsuch date but not completed until after such date. (2)\nA provider who is permitted to remain in\nthe medical assistance program as a result of meeting the conditions of\ncontinuation, as set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, may remain in\nthe program until the earlier of: (i) the\ndate that an administrative hearing decision is issued in the evidentiary\nhearing which upholds the department's termination or nonrenewal action; or\n(ii)\nthe 120th day after the\neffective date of termination of the facility's provider agreement or, if the\nagreement is not terminated, the 120th day after the effective date of\nexpiration.

Failure to maintain an up-to-date\ndisclosure form on file or to submit one within 35 days of a request by the\ndepartment or to disclose any information as required by section\n502.6\nof this Title will result in\nthe automatic termination of the provider's participation in the medical\nassistance program. A notice confirming the termination will be sent to the\nprovider. (f) A provider's\nparticipation may be terminated and a new application for enrollment required\nwhere the ownership or control of the provider has substantially changed since\nacceptance of its enrollment application, whether by the sale or exchange of\nthe capital stock in a provider organized as a corporation, the addition or\nelimination of one or more partners in a provider organized as a partnership, or the sale of the business or assets of any provider entity. A notice advising\nof the termination and of the requirement to submit a new application for\nenrollment will be sent to the provider prior to its termination from the\nprogram. (g) A provider's\nparticipation will be terminated where the provider furnished incorrect, inaccurate or incomplete information in connection with an application and\nwhere provision of correct, accurate and complete information would have\nresulted in the denial of the application based upon one or more of the factors\nset forth in subdivision (a) of section\n504.5\nof this Part. A notice, as\nprovided for in subdivision (b) of section\n504.5, shall be sent to the\nprovider confirming the termination and stating the reason or reasons for which\na denial would have been made. (h) A provider's participation will be terminated where the provider fails or\nrefuses to pay the full amount of any penalty imposed, including any interest\nthereon, pursuant to Part 516 of this Title on or before the 90th day after the\ndate of the department's notice or, where a hearing has been requested pursuant\nto Part 519 of this Title, on or before the 90th day after the date of a\ndecision after hearing which affirms the penalty.
