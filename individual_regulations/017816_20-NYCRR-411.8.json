  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 411.8 - Transfer of registration\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 283(9)\n(a) The registration granted to a distributor\nby the Department of Taxation and Finance is personal to the person to whom it\nis granted. (b) The transfer of a\nregistration as a distributor to another person without the prior written\napproval of the department is invalid and will not be recognized by the\ndepartment and is grounds for the immediate cancellation or suspension of the\nregistration. (c) In addition to\nthe usual meaning, a\ntransfer of a registration\nhas occurred\nif: (1)\na new partner is added to the entity\nregistered as a distributor or a new person replaces an existing partner in\nsuch entity; or\n(2)\nshares of stock\nare acquired by any person so that such person owns or controls, directly or\nindirectly, more than 10 percent of the number of shares of voting stock of an\nentity registered as a distributor (in the case of a registrant which has four\nor fewer shareholders owning such voting stock, 25 percent or more is\nsubstituted for \"more than 10 percent\" in applying this paragraph). (d) An application for approval of\ncontemplated transfer must be made to the department. Such application is made\nin the same manner as an application for registration as a distributor of motor\nfuel. The same information and documents required upon the application for\nregistration as a distributor must be submitted. In addition, a statement\ndescribing the transaction which will constitute the transfer, including the\ndate of the proposed transfer, the identities of the parties to the\ntransaction, the interests which are proposed to be transferred and responsible\npersons (officers, directors, partners, shareholders owning more than 10\npercent of voting stock, employees under a duty to act for such applicant in\ncomplying with any requirement of article 12-A of the Tax Law) of the entity\nwhich is the subject of the application for approval of contemplated transfer\nmust also be provided. (e) Within\n75 days after the Department of Taxation and Finance has been supplied with the\nproperly completed application and any other documents or additional\ninformation requested, it will issue a determination either granting or denying\nthe application for approval of transfer. The determination of the department\nmust be based on the same criteria used in making a determination with respect\nto an application for a registration as a motor fuel distributor. If the\ndepartment fails to issue a determination within 75 days, it is required to\ngive its approval to the application. Any determination issued pursuant to this\nsubdivision may only be protested in the same manner and upon the same\nconditions as a determination respecting an application for a\nregistration. (f) Upon approval of\nthe application, the department may either issue a new registration as a\ndistributor of motor fuel or reissue the existing registration, provided a bond\nor other security, in the required amount, is filed or deposited with the\ndepartment. The department will not issue a determination respecting the amount\nof the required bond or other security until all requisite information, including financial statements and an estimate of expected monthly sales of\nmotor fuel required under section\n411.1\n(b) of this Part has been provided. (g) (1)\n\nThere is an exception to the requirement\nof prior approval for transfers of registrations in the case of transfers by\nway of bequest or inheritance from the decedent directly to: (i) an ancestor of the decedent; (ii)\nthe spouse of the decedent; (iii)\na lineal descendant of the decedent, of\nthe decedent's spouse, or of a parent of the decedent; or\n(iv)\nthe spouse of any lineal descendant\ndescribed in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. (2)\n(i) A\ntransfer of registration as a distributor of motor fuel occasioned by a bequest\nto or inheritance received by the individuals described in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision will not, of itself, be considered a transfer which will\noperate as grounds to cancel such registration if a revised application for\nregistration is submitted to the department within 90 days of the death of the\ndecedent. The failure to submit a revised application within such 90 days will\nbe grounds for immediate cancellation or suspension of the\nregistration. (ii)\n\nSuch application\nfor registration may be filed in all cases by an interested relative enumerated\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision or by the personal representative of the\ndecedent and in the case of a corporation or partnership by the entity\nregistered as the distributor of motor fuel. (3)\n\nThe department will review such\napplication in the same manner as any application for registration and any of\nthe grounds for denying, cancelling or suspending an application for a\nregistration as specified in article 12-A of the Tax Law are grounds for the\ndepartment to deny the revised application. A denial issued pursuant to this\nparagraph may only be protested in the same manner and upon the same conditions\nas a denial of an application for registration as a distributor of motor\nfuel. (4)\n\nUpon approval of the\nrevised application, the department may either issue a new registration as a\ndistributor of motor fuel or reissue the existing registration, provided a bond\nor other security, in the required amount, is filed or deposited with the\ndepartment. The department will not issue a determination respecting the amount\nof required bond or other security until all requisite information including\nfinancial statements and an estimate of expected monthly sales of motor fuel\nrequired under section\n411.1\n(b) of this Part has been provided.
