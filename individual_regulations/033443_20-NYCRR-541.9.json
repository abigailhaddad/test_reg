  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 541.9 - Contractor's purchase, rental, repair, and use of equipment and vehicles\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1105(a), (c)(3), (5); 1110; 1111(b)(1), (2); 1118(2), (7)\n(a) General. The purchase, rental, lease or license to use construction\nequipment and motor vehicles by a contractor is subject to sales and use\ntax. (b) Purchase of\nequipment and motor vehicles. (1)\n\nContractor owned equipment. (i) The purchase\nof equipment, other than motor vehicles such as trucks, by a contractor is\nsubject to tax on the total purchase price at the combined State and local tax\nrate in effect in the jurisdiction where the equipment is delivered to the\ncontractor. (ii)\n\nPurchases of\nequipment for both use and rental by the contractor are taxable on the total\npurchase price. The contractor is liable for tax on the equipment purchased by\nhim and must collect tax on the equipment rented by him to others without\ncredit for any tax paid on the purchase. Only that equipment which is purchased\nexclusively for rental purposes qualifies for the resale exclusion. (iii)\n\nIf a contractor uses equipment in a\njurisdiction other than where purchased, and the contractor was a resident of\nthe jurisdiction of subsequent use at the time of purchase, and such\njurisdiction imposes a higher tax rate than the local tax rate paid at the time\nof purchase or the State rate is higher in the jurisdiction of subsequent use, then the contractor owes an additional use tax based upon the difference\nbetween the State and local tax rates paid at the time of purchase and the\n\nState and local tax rates in effect in the jurisdiction where the equipment is\nsubsequently used. Thus, a contractor may owe additional local tax in each\njurisdiction in which the equipment is used until the maximum aggregate State\nand local tax rate is reached. If, however, the jurisdiction in which the\nequipment is subsequently used imposes a lower tax rate than the local tax rate\npaid at the time of purchase, no credit or refund may be allowed for the\ndifference between the two tax rates. (iv)\n\nEquipment delivered outside of New York\n\nState to contractors who are residents of New York State on the date of\npurchase is subject to the New York State use taxes which become due on the\ndate the equipment is first brought into New York State. (a) The tax is based on the purchase price of\nsuch equipment, unless: (1)\nthe equipment was\nused outside this State by the contractor for more than six months prior to its\nuse within this State, in which case the tax may be based on the current market\nvalue of such equipment (but not to exceed its cost) at the time of first use\nwithin the State; or\n(2)\nthe\nequipment is brought into New York State for use in this State and used in the\nperformance of a contract or subcontract for less than six months, in which\ncase the tax may be based, at the option of the taxpayer, on the fair rental\nvalue of such equipment for the period of use within the State. (b) The contractor may be eligible\nfor a reciprocal tax credit against the use tax due. (v) Likewise, the local use tax becomes due\non the date a contractor brings equipment into a jurisdiction in which he was a\nresident at the time of purchase. (a) The tax\nis based on the purchase price of the equipment, unless: (1)\nthe equipment was used outside such\njurisdiction by the contractor for more than six months prior to its use within\nthe jurisdiction, in which case the tax may be based on the current market\nvalue of such equipment (but not to exceed its cost) at the time of first use\nwithin the jurisdiction; or\n(2)\nthe\nequipment is brought into the jurisdiction for use in the jurisdiction and used\nin the performance of a contract or subcontract for less than six months, in\nwhich case the tax may be based, at the option of the taxpayer, on the fair\nrental value of such equipment for the period of use within the\njurisdiction. (b) The\ncontractor may be eligible for a reciprocal tax credit against the use tax due. Cross-reference: For definition of use, see section\n526.9\nof this\n\nTitle. Example 1: Acme Builders, which, on April 8th, is performing contracts\nin Area A (with a five percent combined State and local tax rate) and in Area B\n(with a seven percent combined State and local tax rate), purchases and takes\ndelivery of a piece of construction equipment in a neighboring state and pays a\nthree percent sales tax in that state. The equipment is used out-of-state and\non June 19th is brought into Area A for use there. On August 28th it is brought\ninto Area B for use there and on October 11th it is last used in New York State\nand subsequently returned to the state where purchased. The contractor, a\nresident in Area A and B on the date of purchase, owes a use tax. The\ncontractor may base his use tax on the purchase price or on a fair rental\nvalue. If the contractor elects to base the use tax on the\npurchase price, a five percent use tax is due in Area A. If the neighboring\nstate where the purchase was made allows a corresponding credit for taxes paid\nto New York State, the rate of five percent may be reduced by the rate of tax\npaid in the neighboring state (three percent). Upon use in Area B an additional\ntwo percent use tax is due. If the contractor elects to base the use tax on fair rental\nvalue, the fair rental value will be subject to use tax at five percent for the\nperiod of June 19th through August 27th and from August 28th through October\n11th at seven percent. These rates may be reduced by three percent, the\nneighboring state's sales and use tax rate, if the neighboring state where the\npurchase was made allows a corresponding credit for taxes paid in New York\n\nState. (vi)\n\nIf a\nresident contractor purchases equipment delivered outside New York State and\nthe state in which the equipment was purchased does not have a reciprocal tax\ncredit with New York State, no credit may be allowed for the tax paid to the\nother state against the New York State and local compensating use taxes\ndue. (vii)\n\nIf equipment purchased\nin one jurisdiction is subsequently used in a second jurisdiction imposing a\nlower tax rate than the tax rate paid at the time of purchase, no credit or\nrefund may be allowed for the difference between the two tax rates. (2)\n\nContractor owned motor\nvehicles. (i) Purchases of commercial motor\nvehicles, for example, commercial trucks, tractors and trailers, are subject to\nthe tax based upon the State and local tax rates in effect in the jurisdiction\nwhere the vehicle is delivered unless, prior to taking delivery, the contractor\nfurnishes a properly completed affidavit to the motor vehicle dealer stating\nthat the commercial motor vehicle will be garaged and be principally used in\nother than the jurisdiction where delivered. Principal use\nmeans use for over half of the use of the vehicle. Where the contractor\nfurnishes such affidavit to the motor vehicle dealer, the dealer is required to\ncollect the State and local tax at the tax rate for the jurisdiction where the\nmotor vehicle will be garaged or principally used as set forth by the\ncontractor in his affidavit. (ii)\n\nIf a contractor is a resident of several jurisdictions, the initial tax due is\nbased upon the State and local tax rates in effect in the jurisdiction in which\nthe commercial motor vehicle is delivered to the contractor, except as\notherwise provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. The contractor owes\nadditional local tax in each jurisdiction in which the motor vehicle is garaged\nor principally used until the maximum aggregate State and local tax rate is\nreached. If, however, the jurisdiction in which the motor vehicle is\nsubsequently used imposes a lower tax rate than the local tax rate paid at the\ntime of purchase, no credit or refund may be allowed for the difference between\nthe two tax rates. (iii)\n\nWhere such\nan additional local use tax becomes due as provided in clause\n(\na\n) of this subparagraph, the local tax is based on the\npurchase price of the motor vehicle, unless: (a) the motor vehicle was used outside such\njurisdiction by the contractor for more than six months prior to its use within\nthe jurisdiction, in which case the tax may be based on the current market\nvalue of such motor vehicle (but not to exceed its cost) at the time of first\ntaxable use within the jurisdiction; or\n(b) the motor vehicle is brought into the\njurisdiction for use in the jurisdiction and used in the performance of a\ncontract or subcontract for less than six months, in which case the tax may be\nbased, at the option of the taxpayer, on the fair rental value of such motor\nvehicle for the period of use within the jurisdiction. Cross-reference: For definition of resident contractor, see section\n541.2\nof\nthis Part. (3)\n\nNonresident contractor purchases. (i) If a nonresident contractor purchases\nequipment within the State, the total charge is subject to the tax at the\ncombined State and local tax rate in effect in the jurisdiction in which such\nequipment is delivered to the contractor. Where the vendor or a common carrier\n(other than the purchaser) delivers the equipment to the nonresident contractor\noutside the State, the charge is not subject to the tax. (ii)\n\nIf a nonresident contractor purchases a\nmotor vehicle, the charge is not subject to the tax even if delivery to the\nnonresident contractor is made within the State, providing the\ncontractor-purchaser furnishes a properly completed certificate for purchase of\nmotor vehicle (by nonresident of New York State or nonresident of local taxing\njurisdiction) to the motor vehicle dealer. Cross-reference: For definition of resident contractor, see section\n541.2\nof\nthis Part. (iii)\n\nEquipment\nand motor vehicles which are purchases out-of-state by a nonresident contractor\nare not subject to compensating use tax upon subsequent use within New York\n\nState. (iv)\n\nEquipment and motor\nvehicles which are purchased outside of a jurisdiction by a contractor who is\nnot a resident of such jurisdiction at the time of purchase are not subject to\nthat jurisdiction's compensating use tax upon subsequent use within that\njurisdiction. Cross-reference: For taxation of contractor leased and rented equipment and\nmotor vehicles, see subdivision (c) of this section. (4)\n\nLeases with option to buy. If a contractor leases equipment or motor vehicles with an\noption to buy, each lease payment is subject to tax. If the option is\nexercised, the amount subject to the tax is the total option purchase price\npaid for the equipment or motor vehicle. Cross-reference: For rentals and leases, see section\n526.7\nof this Title. For special rules pertaining to certain leases of motor\nvehicles, vessels and noncommercial aircraft see section\n527.15\nof this Title. Example 2: A lease agreement or contract provides for an option to\npurchase at a stated purchase price, less total lease payments made, plus one\npercent per month computed on the outstanding balance after each lease payment. The stated purchase price, less the lease payments, plus the one percent per\nmonth is the total option purchase price subject to the tax. (c) Rentals and leases of\nequipment and motor vehicles to contractors. (1)\n\nRentals and leases of equipment to\ncontractors. (i) Where a contractor leases\nequipment, the contractor is liable for the combined State and local sales and\nuse tax on the total charges at the highest rate in effect in any jurisdiction\nin which the equipment is used during the lease payment period, (\ne.g., daily, weekly, monthly, depending on the frequency of\npayment). (a) If a lessor does not collect the\nproper amount of tax based upon the highest rate in any jurisdiction in which\nthe equipment is used, the contractor is liable for payment of any additional\ntax which must be reported and paid by the contractor to the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance. The contractor may be entitled to a refund or credit if\nthe equipment is used for the whole of a lease payment period in a jurisdiction\nhaving a lower combined State and local tax rate than the rate paid to the\nlessor. Example 1: A leasing company delivers equipment to a contractor in a\ntaxing jurisdiction with a combined New York State and local tax rate of six\npercent. The leasing company charges the six percent tax rate on the weekly\nbillings to the contractor. The contractor uses the equipment during a one-week\nbilling period on a job located within a taxing jurisdiction having a combined\n\nNew York State and local tax rate of seven percent, and for one complete weekly\nbilling period in a taxing jurisdiction having a combined New York State and\nlocal tax rate of five percent. The contractor owes an additional one percent\ntax on the charge applicable for the use in the seven percent area. However, the contractor may claim a refund or credit of one percent for the complete\nweek of use in the five percent area, based upon the difference between the six\npercent tax paid and the five percent tax due. (b) The total amount of the lease charge is\nsubject to tax. Interest and other expenses paid by a lessor on the purchase of\ntangible personal property leased to a contractor, even though separately\nstated on the bill to the contractor, must be included in the receipts subject\nto tax. Example 2: A lessor purchases equipment on credit for lease or rental\nto a contractor. The leasing or rental agreement provides that the contractor\nis to pay $100 per month for equipment rented and $7 per month to reimburse the\nlessor for interest expense incurred in the purchase of the equipment. The tax\nis to be collected on the total receipts of $107. (c) If a contractor cancels a lease on\nequipment and the lessor charges a cancellation fee, such fee is included as a\npart of the total receipts upon which the tax is based. (d) The current rate of tax is required to be\npaid on rented or leased equipment used in the performance of a preexisting\nlump-sum capital improvement contract. However, the contractor is entitled to\napply for a refund or a credit of any difference between the tax paid and the\ntax due as provided in section\n1119\nof the Tax Law. (ii)\n\nWhen dominion and control of equipment\nsupplied with an operator or driver remains with the lessor, there is no rental\nor lease of equipment to the contractor, but the service performed may be\nsubject to the tax pursuant to section\n1105 (c)(3) and (5)\nof the Tax Law. The method of payment\n(for example, a rate per hour, day, week, month, or job or trip) is not\nrelevant in determining whether the transaction is a service or a taxable\nrental or lease of equipment. (a) If the\nservice performed constitutes a capital improvement to real property, for\nexample, a foundation excavation, the charge for such service is not\ntaxable. (b) If the service\nperformed constitutes a repair, maintenance or service to tangible personal\nproperty or to real property, the service is subject to the tax. (c) However, the owner-operator of the\nequipment must pay tax on the equipment used to perform the foregoing\nservices. (iii)\n\nWhen\ndominion and control of equipment supplied with an operator or driver transfers\nto the contractor, there is a rental or lease of tangible personal property and\nthe charge is subject to the tax. If the operator's or driver's wages are\nseparately stated and reasonable in relation to prevailing wage rates, such\nwages may be excluded from the receipts subject to the tax. If the operator's\nor driver's wages are not separately stated the total charge is subject to the\ntax. If the operator's or driver's wages are not reasonable in relation to\nprevailing wage rates, the \"wages\" must be included in the receipts subject to\nthe tax until the contractor satisfies his burden, under section\n1132 (c)\nof the Tax Law, or\nproving that the taxable receipts are less than the total charge. (iv)\n\nAll expenses incurred by a lessor in\ndetermining the amount charged for rental of tangible personal property to a\ncontractor, such as: setting up, assembling, installing and/or dismantling, are\nelements of the total receipt subject to tax, regardless of their taxable\nstatus and whether they are separately billed to the lessee. Cross-reference: For definition of expenses as an element of taxable\nreceipts, see section\n526.5\n(e) of this Title. For definition of dominion and control, see section\n541.2\nof\nthis Part. For refunds and credits, see Part 534 of this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nContractor rentals and leases of motor vehicles. (i) If a contractor rents or leases a motor\nvehicle, whether with or without a driver, the contractor is liable for the\ncombined State and local sales and use tax on the total charges at the highest\nrate in effect in any jurisdiction in which the motor vehicle is used during\nthe lease payment period, (\ne.g., daily, weekly, monthly, depending on the frequency of payment). For special rules pertaining to certain\nleases of motor vehicles, vessels and noncommercial aircraft, see section\n527.15\nof this Title. (ii)\n\nIf a lessor\ndoes not collect the proper amount of tax based upon the highest rate in any\njurisdiction in which the motor vehicle is used, the contractor is liable for\npayment of any uncollected tax which must be reported and may be entitled to\nrefund or credit if the motor vehicle is used for the whole of a lease payment\nperiod in a jurisdiction having a lower combined State and local tax rate than\nthe tax paid. (iii)\n\nWhen dominion\nand control of a motor vehicle furnished with an operator or driver remains\nwith the lessor, there is no rental or lease of a motor vehicle. Cross-reference: For definition of rental, lease and license to use, see\nsection\n541.2\nof\nthis Part. (iv)\n\nWhen\ndominion and control of a motor vehicle furnished with a driver transfers to\nthe contractor, there is a rental or lease of tangible personal property and\nthe charge is subject to the tax. If the driver's and any helper's wages are\nseparately stated and reasonable in relation to prevailing wage rates, such\nwages may be excluded from the receipts subject to the tax. If the driver's and\nhelper's wages are not separately stated the total charge is subject to the\ntax. If the driver's and helper's wages are not reasonable in relation to\nprevailing wage rates, the \"wages\" must be included in the receipts subject to\nthe tax until the contractor satisfies his burden, under section\n1132 (c)\nof the Tax Law, of\nproving that the taxable receipts are less than the total charge. (v) Leased motor vehicles are subject to tax\nat the rate due at the point of delivery of the vehicle to the\nlessee-contractor and the lessor is required to collect the tax on each lease\nor rental payment. If the lessor does not collect the proper State and local\ntax on the use of the vehicles in a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in\nwhich delivery is made, the lessee is entitled to a refund or credit, or is\nliable for payment of the compensating use tax, for the lease period(s). For\nspecial rules pertaining to certain leases of motor vehicles, vessels and\nnoncommercial aircraft, see section\n527.15\nof this Title. (vi)\n\nThe total\namount of the lease or rental charge is subject to tax. However, if nontaxable\nitems such as insurance (including collision damage waivers) and driver's wages\n(if reasonable in relation to prevailing wage rates) are sold outright to the\nlessee in conjunction with the lease or rental, the charges for such items are\nnot subject to tax if they are separately stated. (vii)\n\nIf a contractor cancels a lease on a\nmotor vehicle and the lessor charges a cancellation fee, such fee is included\nas a part of the total charges upon which the tax is based. (viii)\n\nThe current rate of tax is required to\nbe paid on rented or leased motor vehicles used in the performance of a\npreexisting lump-sum capital improvement contract. However, the lessee is\nentitled to apply for a refund or credit of any difference between the tax paid\nand the tax due as provided in section\n1119\nof the Tax Law. Cross-reference: For refunds and credits, see Part 534 of this Title. For\ndefinition of rental, lease and license to use, see section\n541.2\nof\nthis Part. For special rules pertaining to certain leases of motor vehicles, vessels and noncommercial aircraft, see section\n527.15\nof this Title. (d) Repairs to equipment and motor\nvehicles owned, rented, or leased by contractors. (1)\n\nThe term\nrepairs, as\nused in this section, includes maintaining, servicing or repairing equipment or\nvehicles owned by or rented or leased to contractors. (2)\n\nThe total charge for repairs, including\nparts, materials, and labor, to a contractor's equipment or motor vehicles is\nsubject to tax: (i) when the repaired\nequipment or motor vehicle is delivered to the contractor in this State; or\n(ii)\nif the repaired equipment\nor motor vehicle is delivered to a resident contractor in another state, when\nthe equipment or motor vehicle is subsequently returned to this\n\nState. (3)\n\nWhen\nequipment or motor vehicles owned by a contractor are repaired by the\ncontractor's employees, the wages, salaries and other compensation paid by the\ncontractor to the employees are not subject to the tax. However, the cost of\nthe parts and materials is subject to the tax. (4)\n\nCharges for repairs on rented or leased\nequipment and motor vehicles are taxable to the contractor-lessee when the\ncontractor is responsible or any repairs incurred. The contractor owes the tax\ndue on repairs performed on the equipment and motor vehicles made within this\n\nState and, if such equipment or motor vehicle is repaired outside this State\nfor a resident contractor, when the equipment or motor vehicle is subsequently\nreturned to this State. (5)\n\nRepair\nparts and services to equipment or motor vehicles that are used exclusively for\nrental or lease purposes may be purchased by the lessor for resale. (i) When the lessor is responsible for any\nrepairs to the equipment or motor vehicles incurred by the contractor, the\nrepair charges are exempt when the equipment or motor vehicles are purchased\nexclusively for rental. (ii)\n\nIf the\ncontractor has repairs made to rented or leased equipment or motor vehicles and\nis fully reimbursed by the lessor, the lessor may claim a refund or credit for\nthe tax that was reimbursed to the contractor. (iii)\n\nCharges for repairs to equipment or\nmotor vehicles that have a mixed use (for self use and for rental or lease\npurposes) are taxable. (6)\n\nIf another state's sales tax was paid by\nthe contractor to an out-of-state vendor on repairs, which are not reimbursed\nby the lessor, and the other state has a reciprocal agreement with New York\n\nState, a claim for credit may be submitted by the contractor for the other\nstate's tax rate paid against (but not to exceed) the New York State and local\ncompensating use tax rate due. Cross-reference: For use tax liability and reciprocity, see section 531 of\nthis Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
