  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 151.1 - Statement of policy\n\nState Regulations\n\nOn December 7, 1979, the State of New York and the Public\n\nEmployees Federation, AFL-CIO, signed a collective bargaining agreement for the\nperiod April 1, 1979 through March 31, 1982, covering employees in the\n\nProfessional, Scientific and Technical Services Negotiating Unit, which\nprovides, in part, that the parties develop a work performance evaluation\nsystem to improve job performance and recognize employee achievement. Because\nthe State and the union did not have an opportunity to fully develop a\nperformance evaluation system, interim rules and regulations were established\nto cover the period April 1, 1979 through September 30, 1980. However, final\nagreement for such system has been reached for the remainder of the 1979-82\ncontract period and these rules, which implement and govern this performance\nevaluation system, replace former Part 151 which governed the interim\nperiod. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n151.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
