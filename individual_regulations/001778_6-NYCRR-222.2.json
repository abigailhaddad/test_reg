  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 222.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The definitions\nof Part 200 and Subpart 201-2 of this Title apply to this Part unless they are\ninconsistent with the definitions in subdivision (b) of this Section. (b) The following definitions also\napply to this Part: (1)\n'Compression\nignition'. A type of stationary internal combustion engine that is not a spark\nignition engine. (2)\n'Demand\nresponse program'. The Emergency Demand Response Program or Special Case\n\nResources demand response programs sponsored by the New York Independent System\n\nOperator or similarly designed programs sponsored by distribution utilities and\napproved by the Public Service Commission. (3)\n'Demand response source'. A distributed\ngeneration source enrolled in a demand response program. (4)\n'Demand response event'. Activation of a\ndemand response program by the New York Independent System Operator or a\ndistribution utility. (5)\n'Distribution utility'. A retail distributor of electricity. (6)\n'Distributed generation source'. A\nstationary reciprocating or rotary internal combustion engine that feeds into\nthe distribution grid or produces electricity for use at the host facility or\nboth. This includes, but is not limited to, emergency power generating\nstationary internal combustion engines and demand response sources. (7)\n'Economic dispatch source'. A distributed\ngeneration source intended to provide electricity for general use to a\nbuilding, structure, or collection of structures in place of electricity\nsupplied by the distribution utilities. Demand response and price-responsive\ngeneration sources are considered economic dispatch sources. Economic dispatch\nsources do not include emergency generators or distributed generation sources\nthat provide electricity to power equipment or structures not served by\ndistribution utilities. (8)\n'Lean\nburn engine'. A natural gas-fired spark ignition engine that is not a rich burn\nengine. (9)\n'Maximum load relief'. Maximum power (kilowatts) pledged by a demand response source during demand\nresponse events or the maximum load the source operates at as a\nprice-responsive generation source. (10)\n'Model year'. Means either: (i) The calendar year in which the engine was\noriginally produced, or\n(ii)\n\nThe\nannual new model production period of the engine manufacturer if it is\ndifferent than the calendar year. This must include January 1 of the calendar\nyear for which the model year is named. It may not begin before January 2 of\nthe previous calendar year and it must end by December 31 of the named calendar\nyear. (11)\n'Price-responsive generation source'. A distributed generation source used to\nprovide electricity for short periods of time when the cost of electricity\nsupplied by the distribution utility is high. (12)\n'Rich burn engine'. Any four-stroke\nspark ignited engine where the manufacturer's recommended operating air-to-fuel\nratio divided by the stoichiometric air-to-fuel ratio at full load conditions\nis less than or equal to 1:1. (13)\n'Spark ignition'. A natural gas fueled engine or any other type of engine with\na spark plug (or other sparking device) and with operating characteristics\nsimilar to the theoretical Otto combustion cycle. Dual-fuel engines in which a\nliquid fuel (typically diesel fuel) is use d for compression ignition and\ngaseous fuel (typically natural gas) is used as the primary fuel at an annual\naverage ratio of less than 2 parts diesel fuel to 100 parts total fuel on an\nenergy equivalent basis are spark ignition engines. (14)\n'Three-way catalyst emission controls'. A control technology (also known as non-selective catalytic reduction) that\nreduces NOx, volatile organic compounds and carbon monoxide emissions from rich\nburn engines. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
