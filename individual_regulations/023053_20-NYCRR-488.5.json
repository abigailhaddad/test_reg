  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 488.5 - Unpaid tax, penalties and interest\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 511(1), 512(2)-(3)\n\nUnpaid tax, and unpaid penalties and interest under this\n\nPart may be recovered by the Attorney General by a civil action in the name of\nthe People of the State. Failure to do any act required by or under the\nprovisions of article 21 is deemed an act committed in part at the office of\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance in Albany for all purposes under the Tax\n\nLaw. The certificate of the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance to the effect\nthat a tax has not been paid, that a return has not been filed, or that\ninformation has not been supplied, as required by article 21, or that a claim\nfor refund has been filed, is prima facie evidence of such acts or\nomissions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n488.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
