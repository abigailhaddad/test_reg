  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-3.3 - Reimbursement for ineligible expenditures\n\nState Regulations\n\nOrdinarily, such adjustments for ineligible\nexpenditures as are found necessary will result from a periodic audit of the\nlocal agency by the division's field auditors. The latter will cause to be\ntransferred to account 1620, Ineligible Expenditures, items deemed to be\nineligible, to be held in suspense pending review by the home office of the\ndivision. Upon such review, the local agency will be advised, by letter from\nthe division, which expenditures are definitively declared ineligible. The\nlocal agency shall thereupon reimburse the appropriate funds, not later than\nthe last day of the month in which the letter of ineligibility from the\ndivision is dated, for the expenditures declared ineligible therein. The\ndivision may, however, at any time declare an expenditure ineligible and direct\nthat the appropriate funds be reimbursed. In this connection, local agencies\nare cautioned that the funds used to make the reimbursement must, of course, be\nother than the project revenue or funds advanced or to be advanced by the\n\nState. Financing and other problems raised by the declaration of expenditures\nas ineligible can be largely avoided, as previously indicated, by the local\nagency acting to predetermine the eligibility of expenditures, as far as\npossible. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1640-3.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
