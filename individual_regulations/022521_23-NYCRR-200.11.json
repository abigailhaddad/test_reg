No action shall be\ntaken, except with the prior written approval of the superintendent, that may\nresult in a change of control of a Licensee. (1)\n\nPrior to any change of control, the\n\nPerson seeking to acquire control of a Licensee shall submit a written\napplication to the superintendent in a form and substance acceptable to the\nsuperintendent, including but not limited to detailed information about the\napplicant and all directors, Principal Officers, Principal Stockholders, and\n\nPrincipal Beneficiaries of the applicant, as applicable. (2)\n\nFor purposes of this Section, the term\n\"control\" means the possession, directly or indirectly, of the power to direct\nor cause the direction of the management and policies of a Licensee whether\nthrough the ownership of stock of such Licensee, the stock of any Person that\npossesses such power, or otherwise. Control shall be presumed to exist if a\n\nPerson, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, or holds with power to vote ten\npercent or more of the voting stock of a Licensee or of any Person that owns, controls, or holds with power to vote ten percent or more of the voting stock\nof such Licensee. No Person shall be deemed to control another Person solely by\nreason of his being an officer or director of such other Person. (3)\n\nThe superintendent may determine upon\napplication that any Person does not or will not upon the taking of some\nproposed action control another Person. Such determination shall be made within\n30 days or such further period as the superintendent may prescribe. The filing\nof an application pursuant to this Subsection in good faith by any Person shall\nrelieve the applicant from any obligation or liability imposed by this Section\nwith respect to the subject of the application until the superintendent has\nacted upon the application. The superintendent may revoke or modify his or her\ndetermination, after notice and opportunity to be heard, whenever in his or her\njudgment revocation or modification is consistent with this Part. The\nsuperintendent may consider the following factors in making such a\ndetermination: i)\nwhether such Person's\npurchase of common stock is made solely for investment purposes and not to\nacquire control over the Licensee; ii)\nwhether such Person could direct, or\ncause the direction of, the management or policies of the Licensee; iii)\nwhether such Person could propose\ndirectors in opposition to nominees proposed by the management or board of\ndirectors of the Licensee; iv)\nwhether such Person could seek or accept representation on the board of\ndirectors of the Licensee; v)\nwhether such Person could solicit or participate in soliciting proxy votes with\nrespect to any matter presented to the shareholders of the Licensee; or\nvi)\nany other factor that indicates\nsuch Person would or would not exercise control of the\n\nLicensee. (4)\n\nThe\nsuperintendent shall approve or deny every application for a change of control\nof a Licensee hereunder within 120 days from the filing of an application\ndeemed by the superintendent to be complete. Such period of 120 days may be\nextended by the superintendent, for good cause shown, for such additional\nreasonable period of time as may be required to enable compliance with the\nrequirements and conditions of this Part. (5)\n\nIn determining whether to approve a\nproposed change of control, the superintendent shall, among other factors, take\ninto consideration the public interest and the needs and convenience of the\npublic. (b) Mergers and\n\nAcquisitions. No action shall be taken, except with the prior written approval\nof the superintendent, that may result in a merger or acquisition of all or a\nsubstantial part of the assets of a Licensee. (1)\n\nPrior to any such merger or acquisition, an application containing a written plan of merger or acquisition shall be\nsubmitted to the superintendent by the entities that are to merge or by the\nacquiring entity, as applicable. Such plan shall be in form and substance\nsatisfactory to the superintendent, and shall specify each entity to be merged, the surviving entity, or the entity acquiring all or substantially all of the\nassets of the Licensee, as applicable, and shall describe the terms and\nconditions of the merger or acquisition and the mode of carrying it into\neffect. (2)\n\nThe superintendent\nshall approve or deny a proposed merger or a proposed acquisition of all or a\nsubstantial part of the assets of a Licensee within 120 days after the filing\nof an application that contains a written plan of merger or acquisition and is\ndeemed by the superintendent to be complete. Such period of 120 days may be\nextended by the superintendent, for good cause shown, for such additional\nreasonable period of time as may be required to enable compliance with the\nrequirements and conditions of this Part. (3)\n\nIn determining whether to so approve a\nproposed merger or acquisition, the superintendent shall, among other factors, take into consideration the public interest and the needs and convenience of\nthe public.
