  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 81.3 - Methods of calculation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Base\nyear revenue sharing aid shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions\nof State Finance Law, section 54(1)(k). (b) Base year special city, town, village aid\nshall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of State Finance Law, section 54(1)(1). For the yearly special city, town, village aid payments, the\nfixed amounts shall be adjusted as a result of changes to data elements on a\ncase-by-case basis where the State Comptroller, in the exercise of his\ndiscretionary powers, deems it necessary. (c) Needs based aid shall be calculated in\naccordance with the provisions of State Finance Law, section 54(5). The State\n\nComptroller shall estimate zero local revenues for a municipality which has not\nfiled a 1983 annual financial report with his office. For the purpose of\ncalculating fire district revenues for a fire district located in more than one\ntown, the fire district revenues for each town shall be allocated on the basis\nof the ratio which the taxes levied on real property in that portion of the\ntown located within the fire district bears to the aggregate taxes levied in\nthe fire district. (d) Excess\nrevenue sharing aid shall be calculated in accordance with the provisions of\n\nState Finance Law, section 54(2-a). In the calculation of the total excess\nrevenue sharing aid distribution for towns, the amount of excess revenue\nsharing aid for the town outside village area shall be added to that of the\ntown-wide calculation. If a negative figure results from this calculation, the\nmunicipality will not receive excess revenue sharing aid. (e) Taxable assessed value for town\noutside village areas. (1)\n\nThe Towns of\n\nGreen Island, East Rochester, Rye, Harrison, Pelham, Scarsdale and Mount Kisco\nare contained entirely within the boundaries of one or more villages so no\ntaxable assessed values for town outside village area are determined for such\ntowns. (2)\n\nThe taxable assessed\nvalue for the town outside village area of the Town of Vernon excludes the\ntaxable assessed value of the area of the town which is located within the City\nof Sherrill. (f) Current census population counts for town outside village areas. (1)\n\nThe current census population counts for\ntown outside village areas shall be determined by subtracting the adjusted\ncurrent census population count of the area of a town located within any\nvillages from the adjusted current census population count of the town. The\nresulting census count shall be adjusted by subtracting the number of persons\nresiding within the boundaries of a military post or reservation under the\njurisdiction of the United States located within the town if the number of such\npersons exceeds 25 percent of the population of the town outside village area. (2)\n\nThe Towns of Green Island, East Rochester, Rye, Harrison, Pelham, Scarsdale and Mount Kisco are contained\nentirely within the boundaries of one or more villages so no current census\npopulation counts for the town outside village area shall be determined for\nsuch towns. (3)\n\nThe current census\npopulation count for the town outside village area of the Town of Vernon\nexcludes the population count for the area of the town which is located within\nthe City of Sherrill. (g) Determination of full value. (1)\n\nFull value per capita for each government unit shall be determined by dividing\nthe full value by the current census population count. (2)\n\nAverage full value and personal income\nper capita for counties shall be determined from data provided by the State\n\nBoard of Equalization and Assessment and the State Tax Commission as follows: (i) Divide the sum of the full value of all\nthe counties by the sum of the personal income of all the counties to determine\nthe weighted income factor. This quotient shall be rounded to the sixth decimal\nplace. (ii)\n\nDivide the total\npersonal income of each county by the current census population count to\ndetermine the personal income per capita of each county. (iii)\n\nMultiply the personal income per capita\nof each county by the weighted personal income factor and add this to the full\nvalue per capita of each county. Divide this result by two to determine the\nweighted average of the full value and personal income per capita for the\ncounty. (h) Apportionment and calculation of dissolutionment aid. (1)\n\nThe dissolutionment aid shall be\napportioned in the following amounts for the years following dissolution: Years following the\ndissolution\n\nAmount of dissolutionment\naid\n1\n100%\n2\n80%\n3\n60%\n4\n40%\n5\n20%\n6 and beyond\n0%\n(2)\n\nThe dissolutionment aid will be calculated by using the amount of base revenue\nsharing and excess revenue sharing aid for the dissolved municipality less the\nincrease in the amount which will be apportioned to the municipality within\nwhich the territory of the dissolved municipality is subsequently located and\nto whose population and taxable full value the amounts for the dissolved\nmunicipality have been added. The dissolutionment payment will be added to and\npaid with the successor municipality's excess revenue sharing aid payment\namount. If the excess revenue sharing program is no longer applicable, the\ndissolutionment amount will be added to the regular quarterly State revenue\nsharing payment to such successor municipality. (i) The formula aid rate for State revenue\nsharing aid computations shall be determined for each city, town outside\nvillage area and village, by subtracting the full value per capita from\n$19,637, and for each county by subtracting the weighted average of the full\nvalue and personal income per capita from $19,637. If the remainder is less\nthan or equal to zero, the base revenue sharing aid rate is the formula aid\nrate for that aid unit. If the remainder is greater than zero, the formula aid\nrate for the municipality shall be determined by dividing $245 into the\nremainder. The quotient shall be rounded up to the next whole number which\nshall be the increment multiplier. The revenue sharing aid rate increment shall\nbe multiplied by the increment multiplier to compute a revenue sharing aid rate\nadjustment. The revenue sharing aid rate adjustment shall be added to the base\nrevenue sharing aid rate to determine the formula aid rate. (j) Formula aid for each aid unit shall be\ncomputed by multiplying the formula aid rate of the aid unit by the population\ncount of the aid unit from the current decennial census or a special census if\nfiled in the manner prescribed by State Finance Law, section 54(3). (k) Additional apportionments for each aid\nunit shall be determined by subtracting the amount of dissolutionment aid from\nthe total revenue sharing appropriation for the aid unit. The remainder shall\nbe divided by the total formula aid and the quotient reduced by one to\ndetermine the additional apportionment multiplier. The formula aid shall be\nmultiplied by the additional apportionment factor and the result, truncated to\nthe nearest penny, shall be the additional apportionment for the aid unit. (l) Total revenue sharing aid is\nthe sum of the formula aid, the additional apportionment and the\ndissolutionment aid of each aid unit. (m) Additional city apportionments shall be\ndetermined for each city by first computing the aggregate statewide city\npopulation count by adding the population count for each city determined from\nthe current decennial census or the special census, whichever is higher. Each\ncity's population count shall be divided by the aggregate statewide city\npopulation count and the ratio so determined multiplied by the additional city\nappropriation. The result, truncated to the nearest penny, shall be the amount\nof additional city apportionment for each city. (n) Creation and dissolutionment of\nmunicipalities. (1)\n\nIn a town within\nwhich a village is created, for the purpose of calculating population and\ntaxable full value of the town outside village area, the certified decennial\ncensus population and taxable full value of the area which became the new\nvillage as taken from the same town tax roll which was used to calculate the\ntaxable full value for the town outside village area shall be subtracted from\nthe original population and taxable full value figures of the town outside\nvillage area. (2)\n\nIn a town within\nwhich a village is dissolved, for the purpose of calculating population and\ntaxable full value of the town outside village ara, the certified decennial\ncensus population and taxable full value for town purposes of the dissolved\nvillage shall be added to the original population and taxable full value\nfigures of the town outside village area. The taxable full value of the\ndissolved village to be added to the taxable full value of the town outside\nvillage area shall be determined by the State Comptroller from the best source\navailable. (3)\n\nSpecial city, town, village aid payments for villages which are dissolving prior to the check\ndistribution date shall be dated and distributed on the 31st of December in the\nyear preceding dissolution.
