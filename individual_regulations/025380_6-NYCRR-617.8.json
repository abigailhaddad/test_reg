  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 617.8 - Scoping\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The primary\ngoals of scoping are to focus the EIS on potentially significant adverse\nimpacts and to eliminate consideration of those impacts that are irrelevant or\nnot significant. Scoping is required for all EISs (except for supplemental\nEISs), and may be initiated by the lead agency or the project\nsponsor. (b) The project sponsor\nmust submit a draft scope that contains the items identified in paragraphs (e)\n(1) through (5) of this section to the lead agency. The lead agency must\nprovide a copy of the draft scope to all involved agencies, and make it\navailable to any individual or interested agency that has expressed an interest\nin writing to the lead agency. (c) Involved agencies should provide written comments reflecting their concerns, jurisdictions and needs for environmental analysis sufficient to ensure that\nthe EIS will be adequate to support their SEQR findings. The lead agency must\ninclude such informational needs in the final scope provided they are\nreasonable. Failure of an involved agency to participate in the scoping process\nwill not delay completion of the final written scope. (d) Scoping must include an opportunity for\npublic participation. The lead agency may either provide a period of time for\nthe public to review and provide written comments on a draft scope or provide\nfor public input through the use of meetings, exchanges of written material, or\nother means. (e) The lead agency\nmust provide a final written scope to the project sponsor, all involved\nagencies and any individual that has expressed an interest in writing to the\nlead agency within 60 days of its receipt of a draft scope. The final written\nscope should include: (1)\na brief description\nof the proposed action; (2)\nthe\npotentially significant adverse impacts identified both in Part 3 of the\nenvironmental assessment form and as a result of consultation with the other\ninvolved agencies and the public, including an identification of those\nparticular aspect(s) of the environmental setting that may be impacted; (3)\nthe extent and quality of\ninformation needed for the preparer to adequately address each impact, including an identification of relevant existing information, and required new\ninformation, including the required methodology(ies) for obtaining new\ninformation; (4)\nan initial\nidentification of mitigation measures; (5)\nthe reasonable alternatives to be\nconsidered; (6)\nan identification\nof the information or data that should be included in an appendix rather than\nthe body of the draft EIS; and\n(7)\na brief description of the prominent issues that were considered in the review\nof the environmental assessment form or raised during scoping, or both, and\ndetermined to be neither relevant nor environmentally significant or that have\nbeen adequately addressed in a prior environmental review and the reasons why\nthose issues were not included in the final scope. (f) All relevant issues should be raised\nbefore the issuance of a final written scope. Any agency or person raising\nissues after that time must provide to the lead agency and project sponsor a\nwritten statement that identifies: (1)\nthe\nnature of the information; (2)\nthe\nimportance and relevance of the information to a potential significant\nimpact; (3)\nthe reason(s) why the\ninformation was not identified during scoping and why it should be included at\nthis stage of the review. (g) The project sponsor of this section into\nthe draft EIS\n(h) If the lead\nagency fails to provide a final written scope within 60 calendar days of its\nreceipt of a draft scope, the project sponsor may prepare and submit a draft\nEIS consistent with the submitted draft scope.
