Drivers who fail the physical examination shall not operate a bus until a\nmedical examination is successfully completed. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PERFORMING AND RECORDING PHYSICAL\nEXAMINATIONS\nThe medical examiner should review these instructions\nbefore performing the physical examination. Using the examination form (DS-874)\nanswer each question yes or no where appropriate. The medical examiner should be aware of the rigorous\nphysical demands and mental and emotional responsibilities placed on the driver\nof a bus. In the interest of public safety, the medical examiner is required to\ncertify that the driver is medically qualified. GENERAL INFORMATION. The purpose of this history and\nphysical examination is to certify the applicant's ability to operate a bus\nsafely. The examination should be made carefully and be at least as complete as\nindicated on form DS-874. GENERAL APPEARANCE AND DEVELOPMENT. Note marked\noverweight, or any posture defect, perceptible limp, tremor, or other defects\nthat might be caused by alcoholism, thyroid intoxication, or other illnesses. No driver shall use a narcotic or other habit-forming drug. HEAD-EYES. When other than the Snellen chart is used, the\nresults of such test must be expressed in value comparable to the standard\n\nSnellen test. If the applicant wears corrective lenses, these should be worn\nwhile applicant's visual acuity is being tested. If corrective lenses are\nnecessary, indicate on the examination form by checking the box, \"Qualified\nonly when wearing corrective lenses.\" In recording distance vision use 20 feet\nas normal. Report all vision as a fraction with 20 as numerator and the\nsmallest types read at 20 feet as denominator. The driver must have a distant\nvisual acuity of 20/40 (Snellen) in each eye with a field of vision of at least\n70° in the horizontal meridian in each eye. Note ptosis, discharge, visual\nfields, ocular muscle imbalance, color blindness, corneal scar, exophthalmos, or strabismus, uncorrected by corrective lenses. Monocular drivers are not\nqualified to operate buses. If the driver habitually wears contact lenses, or\nintends to do so while driving, there should be sufficient evidence to indicate\nthat he or she has good tolerance and is well adapted to their use. The use of\ncontact lenses should be noted on the record. EARS. Note evidence of mastoid or middle ear disease, discharge, symptoms of aural vertigo, or Meniere's Syndrome. When recording\nhearing, record distance from patient at which a forced whispered voice can\nfirst be heard. If audiometer is used to test hearing, record decibel loss at\n500 Hz, 1,000 Hz and 2,000 Hz. If the driver is qualified only when wearing a\nhearing aid the following statement must be marked on the examination report: \"Qualified only when wearing a hearing aid.\"\nTHROAT. Note evidence of disease, irremediable\ndeformities of the throat likely to interfere with eating or breathing, or any\nlaryngeal condition which could interfere with the safe operation of a\nbus. THORAX-HEART. Stethoscopic examination is required. Note\nmurmurs and arrhythmias, and any past or present history of cardiovascular\ndisease, of a variety known to be accompanied by syncope, dyspnea, collapse, enlarged heart or congestive heart failures. Electrocardiogram is required when\nfindings so indicate. BLOOD PRESSURE. Record with either spring or mercury\ncolumn type of sphygmomanometer. If the blood pressure is consistently above\n160/90 mm. Hg., further tests may be necessary to determine whether the driver\nis qualified to operate a bus. LUNGS. If any lung disease is detected, state whether\nactive or arrested; if arrested, your opinion as to how long it has been\nquiescent. GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM. Note any disease of the\ngastrointestinal system. ABDOMEN. Note wounds, injuries, scars or weakness of\nmuscles of abdominal walls sufficient to interfere with normal function. Any\nhernia should be noted if present. State how long and if adequately contained\nby truss. ABNORMAL MASSES. If present, note location, if tender, and whether or not applicant knows how long they have been present. If the\ndiagnosis suggests that the condition might interfere with the control and safe\noperation of a bus, more stringent tests must be made before the applicant can\nbe certified. TENDERNESS. When noted, state where most pronounced, and\nsuspected cause. If the diagnosis suggests that the condition might interfere\nwith the control and safe operation of a bus, more stringent tests must be made\nbefore the applicant can be certified. GENITO-URINARY. Urinalysis is required. Acute infections\nof the genito-urinary tract, as defined by local and State public health laws, indications from urinalysis of unstabilized diabetes, symptomatic albumin-urea\nin the urine, or other findings indicative of health conditions likely to\ninterfere with the control and safe operation of a bus, will disqualify an\napplicant from operating a bus. NEUROLOGICAL. If positive Romberg is reported, indicate\ndegrees of impairment. Pupillary reflexes should be reported for both light and\naccommodation. Knee jerks are to be reported absent only when not obtainable\nupon reinforcement and as increased when foot is actually lifted from the floor\nfollowing a light blow on the patella, sensory vibratory and positional\nabnormalities should be noted. EXTREMITIES. Carefully examine upper and lower\nextremities. Record the loss or impairment of a leg, foot, toe, arm, hand or\nfingers. Note any and all deformities, the presence of atrophy, semiparalysis\nor paralysis, or varicose veins. Determine whether sufficient grasp is present\nto enable the driver to secure and maintain a grip on the steering wheel. Determine whether sufficient mobility and strength exist to enable the driver\nto operate pedals properly. Particular attention should be given to and a\nrecord should be made of, any impairment or structural defect which may\ninterfere with the driver's ability to operate a bus safely. SPINE. Note deformities, limitation of motion, or any\nhistory of pain, injuries, or disease, past or presently experienced in the\ncervical or lumbar spine region. If findings so dictate, radiologic and other\nexaminations should be used to diagnose congenital or acquired defects; or\nspondylolisthesis and scoliosis. RECTO-GENITAL STUDIES. Diseases or conditions causing\ndiscomfort should be evaluated carefully to determine the extent to which the\ncondition might be handicapping while lifting, pulling, or during periods of\nprolonged driving that might be necessary as part of the driver's\nduties. LABORATORY AND OTHER SPECIAL FINDINGS. Urinalysis is\nrequired, as well as such other tests as the medical history or findings upon\nphysical examination may indicate are necessary. A serological test is required\nif the applicant has a history of luetic infection or present physical findings\nindicate the possibility of latent syphilis. Other studies deemed advisable may\nbe ordered by the examining physician. DIABETES. If insulin is necessary to control a diabetic\ncondition, the driver is not qualified to operate a bus if the bus driver has\nan established medical history or clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus which\nhas not been stabilized by insulin therapy to the degree that his or her\npersonal physician can certify that such person has not had an incident of\nhypoglycemic shock for a period of two years, or since the last physical\nexamination given pursuant to the requirements of this Part, whichever is\nlonger. In a case where diabetes can be stabilized by a diet or hypoglycemic\nagent and falls within the criteria indicated above, while the driver should\nnot be disqualified, he must be under adequate medical supervision and\nfollow-up. The follow-up shall consist of certification every six months by the\nemployee's personal physician that his or her condition has remained stabilized\nand that he or she has not had an incident of hypoglycemic shock since the last\ncertification.
