(2)\n\nNo human excreta shall be buried in the soil on the watershed of the water supply unless deposited in trenches or pits at a distance of not less than 500 feet from any spring and covered with 18 inches of soil in such a manner as to effectually prevent its being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow.

Where removable watertight containers are provided, they shall be located as far as practicable from any spring. All privies or receptacles referred to in this paragraph shall be constructed or installed only with the approval of the board of trustees of the village of Arcade and in such a manner as effectually to prevent any pollution of the public water supply. (5)\n\nEvery privy or receptacle for the storage or deposit of human excreta located within the distances of 200 feet and 300 feet of any spring shall be arranged so that all excreta will be received in a suitable watertight receptacle, or removable container, which shall be emptied when filled within six inches of the top. The contents if disposed of on the watershed shall be buried as set forth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision.
