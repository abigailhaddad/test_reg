  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 382.32 - Additional criteria for aboveground and belowground disposal\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to the requirements of section\n382.31\nand, if applicable, sections\n382.33 and\n382.34\nof this Part, aboveground\nand belowground disposal methods must meet the requirements of this\nsection. (a) The disposal unit design\nmust ensure that the geochemical interaction between the disposal units and the\nsoils with which they come into contact will not adversely affect the ability\nof the land disposal facility to meet the performance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this\n\nPart. (b) The disposal units must\nbe placed on stable foundations such that settlement of the disposal unit will\nnot adversely affect the ability of the land disposal facility to meet the\nperformance objectives of sections\n382.10\n- 382.15 of this\n\nPart. (c) The disposal units must\nbe designed to maintain their stability and containment of waste under the\nimpact of major natural phenomena which could affect the area of the land\ndisposal facility. (d) The disposal\nunits must be designed to minimize leakage of water into the disposal units. The disposal units must be designed with a system that: (1)\nprevents water resulting from possible\nleakage and internal condensation from saturating the waste; and\n(2)\nprovides for the release of such water\nfrom the disposal units in a manner that will not adversely affect the ability\nof the land disposal facility to meet the performance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this\n\nPart. (e) During the\noperational and institutional control periods, the disposal units must be\nprovided with reliable redundant monitoring systems to give early warning of\nthe failure of the disposal units. (f) The disposal units must function in\nconcert with the other features of the disposal site to ensure that the\nperformance objectives of sections\n382.10\n- 382.15 of this Part are\nmet. The disposal method must be compatible with the following requirements for\nthe disposal site: (1)\n\nThe disposal site must\nbe designed: (i) to minimize water\ninfiltration into the disposal units; (ii)\nto direct percolating or surface waters\naway from the disposal units; and\n(iii)\nto resist degradation by surface\ngeologic processes and biotic activity. (2)\n\nSurface features of the disposal site\nmust direct surface water drainage away from disposal units at velocities and\ngradients that will not result in erosion that will require ongoing active\nmaintenance during and after the institutional control period. (3)\n\nThe disposal site must be designed to\nminimize the contact of water, ice or snow with waste during storage, the\ncontact of standing water or snow with waste during disposal, and the contact\nof percolating or standing water with waste after disposal. (g) The disposal unit design must\nminimize the amount of radioactive material that would be released to the\nenvironment, should water infiltrate the disposal units. (h) Recovery or retrieval of waste from the\ndisposal units must be feasible through the institutional control period. This\nprovision must not adversely affect the ability of the disposal site to meet\nthe performance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n382.32\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
