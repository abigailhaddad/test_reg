  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4038.5 - Requirements for claim; determination by stewards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Form of\nclaim and deposit requirements. (1)\n\nAll claims\nshall be in writing, sealed in an envelope and deposited in a locked box\nprovided for this purpose by the racing secretary or the racing secretary's\ndesignee, at least 10 minutes before post time. Claim slip forms must be in a\nform prescribed by the stewards, must be completely filled out and must, in the\njudgment of the stewards, be sufficiently accurate to identify the claim, otherwise the claim will be void. No money shall accompany the claim. (2)\n\nEach person desiring to make a claim, unless the person has such amount to the person's credit with the association, must first deposit with the association the whole amount of the claim, in a\nmanner approved by the racing secretary or designee for which a receipt will be\ngiven. Unless funds of the claimant available in the claimant's account with\nthe association are sufficient, in the judgment of the stewards, to pay the\ncost of any post-race testing requested on the claim form by the claimant, the\ncommission shall not conduct such testing. If such funds are sufficient, an\namount sufficient to pay for the post-race testing requested on the claim form\nshall be frozen in such claimant's account to secure anticipated costs of\ntesting. (b) Disposition\nof claim. If there is one claim for a horse, the right of claim to such horse\nshall be awarded to such claimant, subject to rights to void the claim set\nforth in this Part. If more than one claimant enters a claim for the same\nhorse, then the disposition of the horse shall be decided by lot by the racing\nsecretary. The racing secretary shall, before conducting such disposition by\nlot, ensure that each potential claimant is eligible to claim pursuant to this\n\nPart. The right of claim to the horse shall be awarded to the claimant thereby\ndecided by lot. (c) Voiding claim\naward to an ineligible claimant. (1)\n\nThrough\nobjection by a horseperson. Any party wishing to contest the award of a right\nof claim to a horse shall make such objection in writing to the stewards no\nlater than one hour after the conclusion of the race from which the horse was\nclaimed (notwithstanding any time period set forth in Part 4039 of this Article\nor otherwise), setting forth the nature of the objection. (2)\n\nThrough initiative of the stewards. The\nstewards may determine, but only within 24 hours after the running of a race, (i) that the claimant had been ineligible to\nmake the claim; or\n(ii)\nthat the\nlease or the entry of a horse was not made in good faith but was made for the\npurpose of obtaining the privilege of entering a claim, in which case the\nstewards shall invoke the procedures set forth in paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nProcedure for determining timely objection to a claim or potential voiding of a\nclaim through the initiative of the stewards. (i) The stewards shall promptly arrange a\ntime, the same day of the race in the case of an objection or the same or next\nday in the case of a potential voiding of a claim through the initiative of the\nstewards, at which the following parties, each of whom may be represented by a\ntrainer or other designated person, shall have a right to be heard: the party\nmaking an objection, if any; the owner who entered the horse in the race; any\nparty that made a claim for the horse; and the racing secretary. After hearing\nsuch parties, the stewards shall make a prompt decision. (ii)\n\nIf the stewards determine that the right\nof claim should not have been awarded to the presumptive claimant, then the\nstewards shall void such claim. If one eligible potential claimant remains, the\nracing secretary shall verify the eligibility of such potential claimant and, if the potential claimant is eligible, the stewards shall award the right of\nclaim to such claimant. If more than one eligible potential claimant remains, the racing secretary shall verify that each such potential claimant is eligible\nto make the claim and then the stewards shall supervise the racing secretary in\nconducting a disposition by lot from among such eligible potential claimants. The right of claim to the horse shall be awarded to the claimant thereby\ndecided by lot. (iii)\n\nAs set forth\nin section\n4038.9\nof this Part, no eligible\npotential claimant shall be permitted to withdraw a claim at any stage of the\nprocess set forth in this paragraph to consider the voiding of a claim or the\naward of the right to claim to an alternate party. (iv)\n\nIf the stewards void a claim pursuant to\nthis subdivision and there are no other eligible potential claimants, then the\nhorse shall be returned to the owner who had entered the horse in the claiming\nrace. (v) There shall be no appeal\nto the commission of the disposition of a horse made pursuant to this section, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary in this Chapter. (vi)\n\nResponsibility for any expenses relating\nto the care of a horse from the time of delivery of the horse after the race to\nthe time alternative custody of the horse is determined pursuant to the\nsubdivision shall remain with the party that had incurred such\nexpenses. (4)\n\nPotential\ndiscipline of persons relating to an ineligible potential claimant. Nothing in\nthis section shall impair the ability of the stewards or the commission to\nimpose sanctions upon a party or person involved in making a claim while the\npotential claimant is ineligible to do so, upon track personnel who fail to\nverify eligibility of a potential claimant before the awarding of a right to\nclaim, or upon a potential claimant who leased or entered a horse not in good\nfaith as described in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (d) Passing\nof ownership of horse, testing and voidability. Claimed horses shall be taken\nafter the race to the test barn for a determination of soundness and for any\ntest samples to be collected. The person determined by the stewards to have the\nright of claim shall become the owner of the horse when the race is started, whether the horse is sound or unsound or injured before or during the race or\nafter the race, except that: (1)\nthe claim is\nvoidable at the discretion of the new owner pursuant to the conditions stated\nin section\n4038.19\nof this Part unless the age\nor sex of such horse has been misrepresented, and subject to the provisions of\nsubdivision (e) of this section; and\n(2)\na claim shall be void for any horse that\ndies during a race or is euthanized on the track following a race; (3)\na claim is voidable at the discretion of\nthe new owner, for a period of one hour after the race is made official, for\nany horse that is vanned off the track after the race; (4)\na claim is voidable at the discretion of\nthe new owner if the horse is placed on the veterinarian's list following an\nexamination by the State veterinarian or other veterinarian who has been\ndesignated by the commission to examine claimed horses in the test barn\nfollowing the race for a determination of soundness for either of the following\nreasons: (i) the horse is grade two lame or\nhigher on the American Association of Equine Practitioners lameness grading\nscale, meaning the lameness of the horse is consistently apparent under certain\ncircumstances (e.g., weight carrying, circling, inclines, hard surface) even if\nsuch lameness is difficult to observe when the horse is at a walk or trotting\nin a straight line; or\n(ii)\nthe\nclaimed horse has bled visibly from a nostril (epistaxis) that is attributable, because the bleeding is not caused wholly by a wound or superficial injury, to\nan episode of exercise induced pulmonary hemorrhage. When a horse is placed on the veterinarian's list\npursuant to this paragraph, the claimant shall be deemed to have voided the\nclaim and the horse shall be removed from the test barn area by the original\nowner, unless the claimant or a representative of the claimant is present at\nthe test barn to be informed of the determination of the State or designated\nveterinarian and, upon being informed of the veterinarian's findings, decides\nimmediately to accept the horse; (5)\na claim shall be void for any horse that\nis scratched before the race is started; and\n(6)\na claim shall be void if the stewards\ndetermine, pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, (i) that the claimant had been ineligible to\nmake the claim; or\n(ii)\nthat the\nlease or the entry of a horse was not made in good faith but was made for the\npurpose of obtaining the privilege of entering a\nclaim. (e) Testing for equine infectious anemia. In the event a horse is claimed, and the\nclaimant has indicated on the claiming blank an election to have a test for\nequine infectious anemia performed and has paid the prescribed fee for such\ntest, a blood sample shall be taken by the State veterinarian, and the sample\nidentified as being from a claimed horse shall be forwarded within 24 hours to\nan approved laboratory to be tested for equine infectious anemia. Pending the\nreceipt of a negative test for equine infectious anemia the monies paid for the\nclaimed horse shall be held by the track. In the event of a positive test for\nequine infectious anemia the ownership of the claimed horse shall revert to the\nowner from whom the horse was claimed and the claiming monies shall be returned\nto the person or persons who claimed the horse. The cost of the test is to be\nborne by the claimant. (f) Provision of records of corticosteroid injections. The previous trainer of a\nclaimed horse shall, within 48 hours after the race is made official, provide\nto the new owner an accurate record of all corticosteroid joint injections that\nwere administered to the horse within 30 days before the race.
