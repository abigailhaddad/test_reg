  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 166-4.2 - Absence with pay\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. (1)\n\nAll Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays\nshall, so far as practicable, be allowed as days off. Employees required to\nwork on any of these days shall not be entitled to compensatory time off in\nlieu thereof. (2)\n\nThe days\nprescribed as holidays by the division's annual calendar for the school year\nshall be observed as holidays. (b) Absences during school year. Except as provided by these rules and except as provided by\nthe division's annual calendar for the school year, employees shall not be\nentitled to any leave of absence with pay during the school year; provided, however, that the division may grant time off with pay for religious\nobservance, teacher conferences and other appropriate professional meetings, and for extraordinary or emergency absences. Employees may be required to make\nup such time off by appropriate adjustments in their daily or weekly work\nschedules. (c) Sick\nleave. (1)\n\nSick leave is absence with\npay necessitated by the illness or disability of the employee including illness\nor disability caused by pregnancy or childbirth. (2)\n\nEmployees shall earn sick leave credits\nat the rate of one-half day per biweekly pay period during periods they are\npaid their regular salary and may accumulate such credits up to a total of 150\ndays; provided, however, that an employee shall not earn sick leave credit for\nany biweekly pay period unless he is in full pay status for at least seven\nworkdays during such biweekly pay period. A part-time employee who is required\nto work a fixed number of hours, five days per week, shall also earn sick leave\ncredit as provided herein, but his total pay when absent on such leave shall be\nthe amount which would have been due him had he been working regularly at his\nusual hours for such period. (3)\n\nAn\nemployee absent on sick leave shall notify his supervisor of such absence and\nthe reason therefor on the first day of such absence and within two hours after\nthe beginning of the employee's workday; provided, however, that where the work\nis such that a substitute may be required, the division may require the earlier\nnotification, but not more than two hours prior to the beginning of the\nemployee's workday. An employee who fails to so notify his supervisor may be\ndeemed to be on leave without pay for that day. Sick leave credits shall not be\nused in units of less than one-half hour. (4)\n\nBefore absence for personal illness may\nbe charged against accumulated sick leave credits, the division may require\nsuch proof of illness as may be satisfactory to it, or may require the employee\nto be examined, at the expense of the division, by a physician designated by\nthe division. In the event of failure to submit proof of illness upon request, or in the event that, upon such proof as is submitted or upon the report of\nmedical examination, the division finds that there is not satisfactory evidence\nof illness sufficient to justify the employee's absence from the performance of\nhis duties, such absence may be considered as unauthorized leave and shall not\nbe charged against accumulated sick leave credits. Abuse of sick leave\nprivileges shall be cause for disciplinary action. (5)\n\nThe division may require an employee who\nhas been absent because of personal illness, prior to and as a condition of his\nreturn to duty, to be examined, at the expense of the division, by a physician\ndesignated by the division, to establish that he is not disabled from the\nperformance of his normal duties and that his return to duty will not\njeopardize the health of other employees. (6)\n\nIn addition to personal illness of the\nemployee, the following types of absence, when approved by the division, may be\ncharged against accumulated sick leave credits: illness or death in the\nemployee's family, provided, however, that charge for such absence shall not\nexceed a maximum of 15 days in any one school year; absence of an employee\ncertified as visually handicapped by the New York State Commission for the\n\nBlind and Visually Handicapped or, where such certification is not obtainable, who is certified by an examining physician or licensed optometrist as blind, as\nmanifested by visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with best\ncorrection or a visual field of 20 degrees or less, or who has a hearing\nimpairment manifested by a speech discrimination score of 40 percent or less in\nthe better ear with appropriate correction as certified by an examining\nphysician or by a licensed audiologist or otolaryngologist, for the purpose of\nobtaining a guide dog and required training related thereto, provided, however, that charge for such absence shall not exceed a maximum of 26 days in any one\ncalendar year; and personal visits to doctor or dentist. Proof of the need for\nsuch absences, satisfactory to the division, may be required. (7)\n\nWhen an employee is transferred to\nanother position in the same or a different department or agency and such\nposition is subject to attendance rules approved by the New York State Civil\n\nService Commission, his accumulated sick leave credits shall be transferred\nwith him. When an employee is separated from service for other than\ndisciplinary reasons and is subsequently reinstated or reemployed within one\nyear after such separation, or is reinstated by action of the State Civil\n\nService Commission, or is reinstated or reemployed while eligible for\nreinstatement from a preferred list, his sick leave credits accumulated and\nunused at the time of his separation shall be restored; provided, however, that\nsuch sick leave credits shall not be restored except when leave records\nsatisfactory to the appointing authority are available\n(8)\n\nEvery employee shall, on the date on\nwhich he becomes subject to these rules, be credited with the number of days of\nsick leave which he had accumulated under the Attendance Rules for Employees in\n\nNew York State Departments and Institutions (see 4 NYCRR Chapter II) and had\nremaining to his credit as of such date. (9)\n\nThis section shall not be construed to\nrequire extension of any employment beyond the time at which it would otherwise\nterminate by operation of law, rule or regulation. (d) Extended sick leave. (1)\n\nThe division may, in its discretion, advance sick leave credits to an employee absent due to personal illness who\nhas exhausted his accumulated sick leave credits. Such advanced sick leave\ncredits shall be repaid, as soon as practicable after the employee's return to\nduty, from subsequent accumulations of time credits. The outstanding unrepaid\nsick leave credits advanced to any employee under the provisions of this\nsection shall not at any time exceed a total of five days. (2)\n\nThe division may, in its discretion, upon\nwritten request from an employee certified as visually handicapped by the New\n\nYork State Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped or, where such\ncertification is not obtainable, who is certified as blind by an examining\nphysician or licensed optometrist as blind, as manifested by visual acuity of\n20/200 or less in the better eye with best correction or a visual field of 20\ndegrees or less, or who has a hearing impairment manifested by a speech\ndiscrimination score of 40 percent or less in the better ear with appropriate\ncorrection as certified by an examining physician or by a licensed audiologist\nor otolaryngologist, advance up to 26 days of sick leave to such employee who\nis absent for the purpose of obtaining a guide dog and required training\nrelated thereto, and who has exhausted accumulated leave credits, provided the\ncumulative total of sick leave credits charged and/or advanced for this purpose\ndoes not exceed 26 days in any one calendar year. Such advanced sick leave\ncredits shall be repaid, as soon as practicable after the employee's return to\nduty, from subsequent accumulations of time credits. The outstanding unrepaid\nsick leave credits advanced to any employee under the provisions of this\nsubdivision shall not at any time exceed a total of 26 days. (e) Sick leave at half\npay. The division may, in its discretion, grant sick leave at\nhalf pay for personal illness to a permanent employee having not less than a\nyear of service after all of his sick leave credits have been used; provided, however, that the cumulative total of all sick leave at half pay granted to any\nemployee after January 2, 1957 shall not exceed one pay period for each\ncomplete six months of his State service. (f) Workers' compensation leave. (1)\n\nLeave for absence necessitated by\noccupational injury or disease. Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (2)\nand (3) of this subdivision, an employee necessarily absent from duty because\nof occupational injury or disease as defined in the Workers' Compensation Law, upon giving notice to the division that he is absent on account of such injury\nor disease and that he claims benefits under such law, shall be allowed leave\nfrom his position for the period of absence necessitated by such injury or\ndisease, up to cumulatively one year including any periods of such absence\nduring which the employee draws sick leave credits. Such leave may be extended\nfor further periods in the discretion of the appointing authority. (2)\n\nConverted cases. If the employee's claim\nfor benefits under the Workers' Compensation Law is controverted by the State\n\nInsurance Fund (at the request of the division or on its own initiative) and\nthe division is so notified, the employee shall not be entitled to leave under\nthis section. This shall not, however, adversely affect the employee's\neligibility for leave under other provisions of these rules. If final\ndetermination of the controverted claim is in favor of the employee, he shall\nbe entitled to leave under this section, and all absences before such final\ndetermination, to the extent that the same were necessitated by his\noccupational injury or disease, shall be deemed to have been pursuant to leave\nunder this section. (3)\n\nPermanent\nincapacity. Leave under this section may be withheld or terminated if the\ndivision determines that the occupational injury or disease suffered by the\nemployee is of such a nature as to permanently incapacitate him for the\nperformance of the duties of his position. (4)\n\nPay during leave. An employee on leave\nunder this section may receive pay, as follows: (i) The division upon finding that the\nemployee is in fact disabled from the performance of his duties, may grant the\nemployee full pay during such leave not exceeding cumulatively six months. Such\nfull pay may be granted irrespective of the employee's accrued credits under\nthese rules. (ii)\n\nExcept when on\nfull pay status under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the employee may draw\naccrued sick leave credits, subject to the provisions of these rules pertaining\nthereto. (iii)\n\nIf not drawing full\npay under subparagraph (i) or subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, an employee\nmay, in the discretion of the division, be allowed to draw sick leave at half\npay for which he may be eligible under these rules. (5)\n\nAccrual of leave credits. An employee who\nreceives full pay for any period of leave under this section shall earn sick\nleave credits during such period. (6)\n\nAward credited to State. An award by the\n\nWorkers' Compensation Board of compensation for any period for which the\nemployee receives or received pay from the State shall be credited to the State\nas reimbursement of wages paid. (7)\n\nRestoration of leave credits. Sick leave credits, including sick leave at half\npay, used by an employee during a period of absence for which an award of\ncompensation has been made and credited to the State as reimbursement for wages\npaid shall be restored to him in full; provided, however, that no restoration\nshall be made for any absence of less than a full day. Credits so restored may\nnot again be used for future absences attributable to the same injury. An\nemployee restored to service after absence on leave under this section shall\nhave one year from the date of such restoration to reduce his accrued leave\ncredits to the limits prescribed in these rules. (8)\n\nReinstatement. Upon request of the\nemployee for reinstatement at or prior to the expiration of the maximum period\nof allowed leave, the division, if in doubt as to whether the employee is\nphysically and mentally fit to perform the duties of his position, may require\nthe employee to undergo medical examination, by a physician designated by the\ndivision, before the employee may be reinstated. If reinstatement is denied, the employee may make application therefor in the manner prescribed by section\n71\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law. If an employee continues absent after the expiration of the\nmaximum period of allowed leave, his eligibility for reinstatement shall be\ngoverned by section\n71\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law. (9)\n\nMedical\nexamination. In order to enable the division to make such determinations as are\nauthorized or required under this section, the division may require an employee\nat any time to be examined by a physician designated by the division. (10)\n\nWhere the division has refused to grant\nthe employee pay during leave pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subdivision, or, has withheld or terminated a leave of absence on the ground that the\noccupational injury or disease is of such a nature as to permanently\nincapacitate the employee for the performance of the duties of his position, the employee may request the Civil Service Commission to review the\ndetermination of the division. If the commission finds that such determination\nof the division is arbitrary or unreasonable, it may reserve or modify such\ndetermination. (11)\n\nConstruction. This section shall not be construed to require extension of any employment\nbeyond the time at which it would otherwise terminate. (g) Leave for subpoenaed appearance and\njury attendance. On proof of the necessity of jury service or appearance as\na witness pursuant to subpoena or other order of a court or body, an employee\nshall be granted a leave of absence with pay with no charge against leave\ncredits; provided, however, that this subdivision shall not apply to any\nabsence by an employee occasioned by such an appearance if he is a\nparty. (h) Leave for\ncivil service examinations. Employees shall be allowed leave with pay to take New York\n\nState Civil Service examinations at the appropriate center provided that due\nnotice is given by the employee to the division. (i) Leave for quarantine. If an employee who is not ill himself is required to remain\nabsent because of quarantine and presents a written statement of the attending\nphysician or local health officer proving the necessity of such absence, he\nshall be granted leave with pay for the period of his required absence, without\ncharge against accumulated sick leave credits. Prior to return to duty, such\nemployee may be required to submit a written statement from the local health\nofficer having jurisdiction that his return to duty will not jeopardize the\nhealth of other employees. (j) Leaves required by law. The division shall grant any leave of absence, with pay, required by law. (k) Leave for civil defense duties. Upon certification by the State Director of Civil Defense\nof the necessity for the participation in State or local civil defense drills\nof an employee enrolled as a civil defense volunteer and required to perform\ncivil defense duties pursuant to the State Defense Emergency Act, the division\nmay allow such employee to absent himself from his position, without loss of\npay or charge against leave credits, for such time as is necessary for\nparticipation in such drills, but not exceeding cumulatively five workdays per\ncalendar year.
