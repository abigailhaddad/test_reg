  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 96.5 - Production of all classes of certified seed\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The certifying agency shall determine\nthat genetic purity and identity are maintained at all stages of certification\nincluding seeding, harvesting, processing, and labeling of the seed. (b) The unit of certification shall be a\nclearly defined field or fields. (c) One or more field inspection shall be\nmade: (1)\nprevious to the time a seed crop of\nany class of certified seeds is to be harvested; and\n(2)\nwhen genetic purity and identity can best\nbe determined. The field shall be in suitable condition to permit an\nadequate inspection to determine genetic purity and identity. (d) One or more inspections of\nharvested lots of seed from inspected fields may be made at any time by\nauthorized persons who shall have authority to recommend to the certifying\nagency the rejection for certification of any lot not properly protected from\nmixture, improperly identified or improperly handled. (e) Seed from inspected fields must be\npositively identified at all times. Bins containing bulk lots of seed (cleaned\nor uncleaned) must be identified either by bin number or by lot number and\nvariety of the seed in the bin. If bin numbers are used, accurate records must\nbe kept to correlate bin number with variety and lot number. Bags must be\nidentified by a stenciled lot number or identification tag securely fastened to\neach bag. (f) All samples from each\ncleaned lot of seed eligible for certification shall be drawn by a person\napproved by the certifying agency and the department as demonstrated by an\napproved compliance agreement for the sampling of certified seed. Samples shall\nbe taken according to the procedures set forth in the AASCO Handbook on Seed\n\nSampling, 2006 edition, published by the Association of American Seed Control\n\nOfficials. The document is available from Anita Hall, 101 East State Street, #214, Ithaca, NY 14850. It is available for public inspection and copying in\nthe offices of the Director of Plant Industry, New York State Department of\n\nAgriculture and Markets, 10B Airline Drive, Albany, NY 12235, or in the offices\nof Department of State, 41 State Street, Albany, NY 12231. Samples shall be\ntaken from and be truly representative of the entire lot of seed which has been\nrecleaned and is in condition for sale. Such sample shall not be considered as\nbeing representative for any seed which is recleaned later. Evidence that any\nlot of seed has not been protected from contamination which might affect\ngenetic purity, or is not properly identified, shall be cause for possible\nrejection of certification. (g) Analysis and tests of samples of seed and definitions and analytical terms\nshall be in accordance with the Rules for Testing Seeds, 2007 edition, published by the Association of Official Seed Analysts. The document is\navailable from the Association of Official Seed Analysts, #285, 601 S. Washington, Mail Boxes, Etc., Stillwater, OK 74074. It is available for public\ninspection and copying in the office of the Director of Plant Industry, New\n\nYork State Department of Agriculture and Markets, 10B Airline Drive, Albany, NY\n12235, or in the office of the Department of State, 41 State Street, Albany, NY\n12231. Testing shall be performed by laboratories approved by the certifying\nagency in consultation with the department. (h) Second sample. If a representative sample\nof the certified class of seed contains one prohibited seed, or in the case of\nquackgrass, one multiple floret, or fails to meet germination standards, the\nlot may be resampled by an official of the seed certifying agency. If the\nsecond sample thus obtained meets certification requirements, the lot will be\naccepted for certification. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n96.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
