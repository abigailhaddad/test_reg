(b) If the child has continued in placement\nbeyond the date the first service plan review is required, the most recent\nassessment and service plan required by the uniform case record shall indicate\nthat conditions persist which, if the child were to be returned home, would\ncontinue to place the child in danger of serious physical or emotional harm. In\norder to establish a continuing danger to the child, the assessment and service\nplan shall cite one or more of the following factors: the parents' or\ncaretakers' willingness to maintain regular contact with the child, their\nbehavior during visits, their response to services offered or provided by the\ndistrict or other involved agencies, their expressed willingness to take the\nchild home and to plan for his or her welfare, the present status of\nenvironmental or any other factors which contributed to the original problems\nwhich necessitated the placement, and the overall progress of the parent toward\nthe accomplishment of the goals established in the most recent service plan\nrequired by the uniform case record.

(6)\n\nPregnancy. (i) Circumstance. A woman is pregnant or has\ngiven birth, and foster care placement would enable the mother and child to\nremain together and would significantly aid the mother in preparing to assume\nresponsibility to care for her child or in making a decision to surrender the\nchild for adoption. (ii)\n\nDocumentation. The first uniform case record form required after the date of\nauthorization for foster care services shall: (a) indicate whether the woman is pregnant or\nhas given birth; and\n(b) contain a\ndescription of the parental functions which the woman is unable to perform, as\nwell as the availability of the woman's parents or other relatives as\nresources.

(e) Notwithstanding any other provisions of\nthis section, reimbursement cannot be withheld for any placement that is\ncontinued beyond 90 days where a determination has been made by the case\nmanager and documented in the assessment and service plan required in the\nuniform case record that the primary factor necessitating continued placement\nis the family's lack of adequate housing and that preventive services, including housing services as defined in section\n423.2\n(b)(16)\nof\nthis Title, have been authorized to facilitate the child's or children's\ndischarge from care and the child or children will be or have been discharged\nwithin two months of such authorization of such services or the date adequate\nhousing is made available to the family.
