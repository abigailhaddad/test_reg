  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-1.3 - Interim status\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. New York State's hazardous waste management facility\npermitting program consists of a phase called \"interim status\" for qualifying\nfacilities and a phase that constitutes the formal permit process. Interim status\nis a condition under which facilities may\noperate prior to completing permit processing requirements. It is a temporary\nmeasure designed to phase existing facilities into compliance with permit\nrequirements. Only certain facilities will be eligible to receive interim\nstatus. All others, including new facilities, must obtain permits before\ncommencing operation. Operation during interim status is conditioned upon\ncompliance with performance standards set forth in Subpart 373-3 of this Part. Interim status may be modified, suspended or revoked in a manner similar to a\npermit. (b) Eligibility. The owners and operators of the following types of\nfacilities are eligible for interim status: (1)\n\nOwners or operators of existing hazardous\nwaste management facilities who submitted part A of their RCRA permit\napplication to the regional administrator no later than: (i) six months after the date of publication\nof regulations which first require them to comply with the standards set forth\nin 40 CFR part\n265\nor\n266\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle); or\n(ii)\n30 days after the\ndate they first became subject to the standards set forth in 40 CFR part\n265\nor\n266\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle), whichever occurred first. Note: For facilities which had to comply with 40 CFR part\n265\nbecause they handle a waste listed in EPA's May 19, 1980, part 261 regulations\n(45 FR\n33006, et seq. ), the deadline for submitting an\napplication was November 19, 1980. Where other existing facilities had to begin\nto comply with 40 CFR part\n265\nor\n266\nat a later date because of revisions to\n40 CFR part\n260, 261, 265\nor\n266, the administrator specified in the preamble\nto those revisions when those facilities had to submit a part A\napplication. (iii)\nfor\ngenerators generating greater than 100 kilograms but less than 1,000 kilograms\nof hazardous waste in a calendar month and treats, stores or disposes of these\nwastes onsite, by March 24, 1987. (2)\n\nFacilities which were not required to\nsubmit a part A of their RCRA permit application to EPA, but which are subject\nto the permit requirements of his Part and submit an EPA part A application to\nthe regional permit administrator in whose jurisdiction the facility is\nlocated, and the director, within 30 days of the effective date of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nFacilities that first\nbecome subject to the permit requirements of this Part due to a change in Part\n371, 373 or 374 of this Title and who submit an EPA part A application to the\nregional permit administrator in whose jurisdiction the facility is located, and the commissioner, within 30 days of the effective date of the change in\n\nPart 371, 373 or 374. (4)\n\nFacilities that have an RCRA part B permit issued by EPA but do not have a Part\n373 permit. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding the\nabove, any owner or operator of an existing hazardous waste management facility\nmust submit a Part 373 permit application in accordance with the dates\nspecified in subdivision (h) of this section. Any owner or operator of a land\ndisposal facility in existence on the effective date of a change to Part 370, et seq. of this Title that requires the facility to have a\n\nPart 373 permit must submit a Part 373 permit application in accordance with\nthe dates specified in subdivision (h). (c) Qualifying for interim\nstatus. (1)\n\nAny person who owns or\noperates an existing HWM facility or a facility in existence on the effective\ndate of statutory or regulatory amendments under the ECL and its regulations\nthat render the facility subject to the requirement to have a Part 373 permit\nwill have interim status and will be treated as having interim status, provided\nthat: (i) the facility is among the\ncategories specified in subdivision (b) of this section; and\n(ii)\nthe owner or operator has complied with\nthe requirements of subdivision (d) of this section governing submission of\ninterim status applications. (2)\n\nWhen the commissioner determines on\nexamination or reexamination of an interim status application that it fails to\nmeet the standards of this Part, the commissioner may commence proceedings to\nrevoke interim status. (3)\n\nParagraph (1) of this subdivision does not apply to any facility which has been\npreviously denied a Part 373 or RCRA part B permit or if authority to operate\nthe facility under this Part or RCRA has been previously terminated. (d) General procedures for\ninterim status application. (1)\n\nApplicant. Whenever the owner and the operator of a facility are different\npersons, the operator is responsible for submitting the required application\nfor interim status, except that the owner is also responsible for signing the\napplication. The operator must also receive the owner's permission to conduct\nall regulated activities, including adequate agreement for site access during\nthe post-closure period for disposal facilities. (2)\n\nForms. The part A of the USEPA RCRA\npermit application (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) is the application form for New York State interim status pursuant to\nthis Part. (3)\n\nSubmission of\napplications. The application shall be submitted to the regional permit\nadministrator in the Department of Environmental Conservation region in which\nthe facility is located and to the Director, Division of Hazardous Substances\n\nRegulation. Note: If the applicant submitted the application to USEPA\nRegion II prior to July 14, 1985, then the requirements of paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision have been satisfied. (4)\n\nSignatories to interim status\napplications and reports. (i) Applications. All applications must be signed as follows: (a) for a corporation: by a responsible\ncorporate officer. For the purpose of this section, a\nresponsible\ncorporate officer\nmeans: (1)\na\npresident, secretary, treasurer or vice-president of the corporation in charge\nof a principal business function, or any other person who performs similar\npolicy or decisionmaking functions for the corporation; or\n(2)\nthe manager of one or more manufacturing, production or operating facilities employing more than 250 persons or having\ngross annual sales or expenditures exceeding $25 million (in second-quarter\n1980 dollars), if authority to sign documents has been assigned or delegated to\nthe manager in accordance with corporate procedure; or\n(b) for a partnership or sole proprietorship: by a general partner or the proprietor, respectively; or\n(c) for a municipality, State, Federal or\nother public agency: by either a principal executive officer or ranking elected\nofficial.

(iii)\n\nChanges to authorization. If an authorization under subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph is no longer accurate because a different individual or position has\nresponsibility for the overall operation of the facility, a new authorization\nsatisfying the requirements of subparagraph (ii) must be submitted to the\ncommissioner prior to or together with any reports, information or applications\nto be signed by an authorized representative. (iv)\n\nCertification. Any person signing a\ndocument under subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph must make the\nfollowing certification: \"I certify under penalty of law that this document and\nall attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance\nwith a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and\nevaluate the information submitted.

(g) Changes during interim status. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision, the owner or operator of an interim status facility may make\nthe following changes at the facility: (i) treatment, storage, or disposal of new hazardous wastes not previously\nidentified in the interim status application (and, in the case of newly listed\nor identified wastes, addition of the units being used to treat, store, or\ndispose of the hazardous wastes on the effective date of the listing or\nidentification) if the owner or operator submits a revised interim status\napplication prior to such treatment, storage, or disposal; (ii)\nincreases in the design capacity of\nprocesses used at the facility if the owner or operator submits a revised\ninterim status application prior to such a change (along with a justification\nexplaining the need for the change) and the commissioner approves the changes\nbecause: (a) there is a lack of available\ntreatment, storage, or disposal capacity at other hazardous waste management\nfacilities; or\n(b) the change is\nnecessary to comply with a Federal, State, or local requirement; (iii)\nchanges in the processes for\nthe treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste or addition of processes\nif the owner or operator submits a revised interim status application prior to\nsuch change (along with a justification explaining the need for the change) and\nthe commissioner approves the change because: (a) the change is necessary to prevent a\nthreat to human health and the environment because of an emergency situation; or\n(b) the change is necessary to\ncomply with a Federal, State, or local requirement; (iv)\nchanges in the ownership or operational\ncontrol of a facility if the new owner or operator submits a revised interim\nstatus application no later than 90 days prior to the scheduled change. When a\ntransfer of operational control of a facility occurs, the old owner or operator\nshall comply with the requirements of section\n373-3.8\nof this Part (Financial\nrequirements), until the new owner or operator has demonstrated to the\ncommissioner that he/she is complying with the requirements of that section. The new owner or operator must demonstrate compliance with section\n373-3.8\nof this Part requirements\nwithin six months of the date of the change in ownership or operational control\nof the facility. Upon demonstration to the commissioner by the new owner or\noperator of compliance with section\n373-3.8\nof this Part, the\ncommissioner shall notify the old owner or operator in writing that he/she no\nlonger needs to comply with section\n373-3.8\nof this Part as of the date\nof demonstration. All other interim status duties are transferred effective\nimmediately upon the date of the change in ownership or operational control of\nthe facility; (v) changes made in\naccordance with an interim status corrective action order issued by the USEPA\nunder section 3008(h) or other Federal authority, by the commissioner under\nsection 71-2727(3) of the ECL or by a court in a judicial action brought by the\nUSEPA or by New York State. Changes under this paragraph are limited to the\ntreatment, storage, or disposal of solid waste from releases that originate\nwithin the boundary of the facility; (vi)\naddition or newly regulated units for\nthe treatment, storage, or disposal of hazardous waste if the owner or operator\nsubmits a revised part A permit application on or before the date on which the\nunit becomes subject to the new requirements. (2)\n\nExcept as specifically allowed under this\nparagraph, changes listed under paragraph (1) of this subdivision may not be\nmade if they amount to reconstruction of the hazardous waste management\nfacility. Reconstruction occurs when the capital investment in the changes to\nthe facility exceeds 50 percent of the capital cost of a comparable entirely\nnew hazardous waste management facility. If all other requirements are met, the\nfollowing changes may be made even if they amount to a reconstruction: (i) changes made solely for the purposes of\ncomplying with the requirements of section\n373-3.10\n(d) of\nthis Part for tanks and ancillary equipment; (ii)\nif necessary to comply with Federal, State, or local requirements, changes to an existing unit, changes solely\ninvolving tanks or containers, or addition of replacement surface impoundments\nthat satisfy the standards of section\n373-2.11, 373-2.14, 373-3.11\nor\n373-3.14\nof this Part; (iii)\nchanges that are necessary to allow\nowners or operators to continue handling newly listed or identified hazardous\nwastes that have been treated, stored, or disposed of at the facility prior to\nthe effective date of the rule establishing the new listing or\nidentification; (iv)\nchanges during\nclosure of a facility or of a unit within a facility made in accordance with an\napproved closure plan; (v) changes\nnecessary to comply with an interim status corrective action order issued by\nthe USEPA under section 3008(h) or other Federal authority, by the commissioner\nunder section 71-2727(3) of the ECL, or by a court in a judicial proceeding\nbrought by the USEPA or by New York State, provided that such changes are\nlimited to the treatment, storage, or disposal of solid waste from releases\nthat originate within the boundary of the facility; (vi)\nchanges to treat or store, in tanks, containers or containment buildings, hazardous wastes subject to land disposal\nrestrictions imposed by Part 376 of this Title or RCRA section 3004, provided\nthat such changes are made solely for the purpose of complying with Part 376 or\nRCRA section 3004; (vii)\naddition\nof newly regulated units under subparagraph (1)(vi) of this subdivision; and\n(viii)\nchanges necessary to\ncomply with standards under 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE, National Emission\n\nStandards for Hazardous Air Pollutants From Hazardous Waste Combustors, as\nincorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (h) Termination of interim status. (1)\n\nInterim status terminates when final\nadministrative disposition of a permit application, except an application for a\nremedial action plan (RAP) under section\n373-1.11\nof this Subpart, is\nmade.

(5)\n\nFor owners or operators of\neach land disposal facility which is in existence on the effective date of\nstatutory or regulatory amendments under the ECL and its regulations that\nrequire the facility to have a Part 373 permit and which is granted interim\nstatus, interim status terminates 12 months after the date on which the\nfacility first becomes subject to such permit requirements unless the owner or\noperator of such facility: (i) submits a Part\n373 application for the facility within 12 months after the date on which the\nfacility first became subject to such permit requirement; and\n(ii)\ncertifies that the facility is in\ncompliance with all applicable ground-water monitoring and financial\nresponsibility requirements. (6)\n\nFor owners or operators of any land\ndisposal unit that is granted authority to operate under subparagraph\n(g)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii) of this section, on the date 12 months after the\neffective date of such requirement unless the owner or operator certifies that\nsuch unit is in compliance with all applicable ground-water monitoring and\nfinancial responsibility requirements. (7)\n\nFor owners or operators of each\nincinerator facility which has achieved interim status prior to November 8, 1984, interim status terminates on November 8, 1989, unless the owner or\noperator of the facility submits a Part 373 permit application for the\nincinerator facility by November 8, 1986. (8)\n\nFor owners or operators of any facility\n(other than a land disposal or an incinerator facility) which has achieved\ninterim status prior to November 8, 1984, interim status terminates on November\n8, 1992, unless the owner or operator of the facility submits a Part 373\napplication for the facility by November 8, 1988. (i) Updating interim status\napplications. (1)\n\nIf any owner or\noperator of a hazardous waste management facility has filed an interim status\napplication and has not yet filed for a Part 373 permit, the owner or operator\nmust file an amended interim status application (EPA RCRA part A): (i) with the regional permit administrator in\nwhose jurisdiction the facility is located, and the director, no later than the\neffective date of revised regulations under Part 371 of this Title, listing or\nidentifying additional hazardous wastes if the facility is treating, storing or\ndisposing of any of those newly listed or identified wastes; (ii)\nas necessary to comply with provisions\nof subdivision (g) of this section for changes during interim status. Revised\nEPA RCRA part A applications for New York State interim status must be filed\nwith the regional permit administrator of jurisdiction and the\ndirector. (2)\n\nThe owner\nor operator of a facility who fails to comply with the updating requirements of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision shall not receive interim status for the\nwastes not covered by duly filed interim status applications (EPA RCRA part\nA's).
