A social services district must\nguarantee child care services to a family who meets the criteria set forth in\nany subparagraph of this paragraph regardless of whether the social services\ndistrict has any State or Federal funds available under this program to pay for\nall or a portion of such costs. In accordance with subdivision (d) of this\nsection, a district may set aside funds and/or establish priorities for\nfamilies eligible for a child care guarantee.

This child care guarantee is available to eligible families for 12\nmonths from the month after the family's eligibility for public assistance has\nterminated or ended. Families may ask for and begin to receive child care in\nany month during the 12-month period of the child care guarantee. The start\ndate for eligibility may precede the date services were requested and cover any\nperiod during the 12 months of the guarantee. (2)\n\nFamilies that are eligible when funds are\navailable.

(2)\nA social services\ndistrict may establish in its consolidated services plan or integrated county\nplan upper income levels above 300 percent of the State income standard for\nfamilies receiving child care services under the title XX provided that the\nincome levels do not exceed 375 percent of the State income standard for a\nfamily of one or two, 355 percent of the State income standard for a family of\nthree, or 325 percent of the State income standard for a family of four or\nmore. (c) A social\nservices district must provide recipients of services funded under the New York\n\nState Child Care Block Grant with such services for 12 or 24 months, except as\nprovided in Section\n415.2\n(d)(4). (d) Priority populations and funding\nset asides. (1)\n\nPriority\npopulations. (i) For child care services\nfunded under the New York State Child Care Block Grant Program, each social\nservices district must give priority to the following federally-mandated\npopulations: (a) families with very low\nincome. Very low income is defined as an income level up to 200 percent of the\nstate income standard; (b) families\nwith children who have special needs; and\n(c) families experiencing\nhomelessness. (ii)\n\nFor\nchild care services funded under the New York State Child Care Block Grant\n\nProgram and/or under title XX of the Federal Social Security Act, each social\nservices district may establish local priorities for child care services\nprovided that the priorities provide eligible families with equitable access to\nchild care assistance funds to the extent that these funds are available. Any\nlocal priorities must be set forth in the district's consolidated services plan\nor integrated county plan. (a) Local\npriorities cannot replace the federally mandated priorities. (b) Local priorities may be based on one or a\ncombination of factors. Local priorities established under the child care block\ngrant cannot be based on income level. (c) Local priorities may not have the effect\nof limiting a caretaker's choice of any eligible child care provider or be\nbased on a caretaker's choice of a child care\ncertificate. (2)\n\nFunding set-asides. (i) Each social services district may set\naside a portion of the district's New York State Child Care Block Grant\nallocation and/or its title XX allocation to serve one or more of the Federal\nand/or the district's local priority populations including families eligible\nfor a child care guarantee; provided that the method of disbursement of funds\nto priority groups provides that eligible families within a priority group will\nreceive equitable access to child care assistance funds to the extent that such\nfunds are available. (ii)\n\nEach\nfunding set aside must be based on a 12-month period and must be described in\nthe district's consolidated services plan or integrated county plan along with\nthe rationale for the set aside amount based on the projected need for that\npopulation. (iii)\n\nWithin each\n12-month period, the amount of the set aside for each particular priority\npopulation may be adjusted up or down by 10 percent without the prior written\napproval of the office. Each such adjustment to a set aside amount must be\nreported to the office within 30 days of the adjustment. (iv)\n\nThe prior approval of the office is\nneeded for any adjustment in the amount of a set aside for a particular\npriority population which would exceed 10 percent of the amount for that set\naside originally specified in the district's consolidated services plan or\nintegrated county plan. (3)\n\nWaiting lists and denial of services. (i) If a social services district has set\naside funds to serve one or more priority populations and all of the available\nfunds that are not set aside are projected to be needed for open child care\ncases, the district may deny services to a family which is not eligible for a\nchild care guarantee and which does not fall within the priority populations\nfor the set asides or place the family on a waiting list for\nsubsidies. (ii)\nA social services\ndistrict that has not established set asides must open a new case for an\neligible family if the district has sufficient funding available to provide\nchild care services to that family for the 12-month eligibility period, or the\n24-month eligibility period for cases funded under the New York State Child\n\nCare Block Grant if the district opts in its Child and Family Services Plan to\nauthorize child care assistance for 24 months, at the time the family is\ndetermined to be eligible. If the district does not have sufficient funding\navailable because all of the available funds are projected to be needed for\nopen child care cases, the district may deny services to a family which is not\neligible for a child care guarantee or place the family on a waiting list for\nsubsidies. (4)\n\nDiscontinuance of services prior to the end of the eligibility period. (i) For New York State Child Care Block Grant\nfunds, a social services district must provide services to recipients for the\nduration of the eligibility period unless: (a) The recipient family's income exceeds 85\npercent of state median income; (b) The recipient family has experienced a non-temporary cessation in work or\nattendance at a training or education program; (c) The recipient failed to agree to a\nreasonable plan for repayment or recovery of an overpayment or failed to comply\nwith an agreed upon plan for repayment or recovery of an overpayment; (d) The recipient has been convicted of or\nvoluntarily admitted to fraudulently receiving child care assistance; (e) The recipient certified and attested to\nfalse information on the application for child care assistance and/or\nenrollment form or any attachment thereto; (f) The child care assistance is provided\npursuant to subparagraph (a)(1)(i) of this section during the public assistance\napplication determination period and such application has been denied, unless\nthe family is found otherwise eligible under this section; (g) A child determined eligible pursuant to\n415.1(b)(1) of this Part turns 14 years of age; (h) A child determined eligible pursuant to\n415.1(b)(2) of this Part turns 19 years of age; or\n(i) A child determined eligible pursuant to\n415.1(b)(3) of this Part turns 20 years of age. (ii)\n\nFor Title XX funds, the case must be\nclosed when the child turns 13 years of age, except that a child who turns 13\nyears of age during a school year may continue to receive child care services\nthrough the end of that school year. Once a social services district has\ncommitted all of the funds available to it, the social services district may\ndiscontinue funding to those families who have lower priorities in order to\nserve families with higher priorities. If no priorities are established and all\nfunds are committed, case closings must be based on the length of time in\nreceipt of services. The length of time used to close cases may be based either\non the shortest or longest time receiving child care services but must be\nconsistent for all families. The social services district must specify in its\nconsolidated services plan or integrated county plan whether case closings will\nbe based on the shortest or longest length of time receiving child care\nservices. (5)\n\nEach social\nservices district must collect and submit to the office information, in the\nform and manner and at the times specified by the office, concerning the\ndisbursement of child care subsidy funds showing the geographic distribution of\nchildren receiving child care services from the district.
