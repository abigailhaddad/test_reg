CUOMO, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nthe Laws of the State of New York, do hereby find that a disaster is imminent\nfor which the affected local governments are unable to respond adequately. Therefore, pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution of the\n\nState of New York and Section 28 of Article 2-B of the Executive Law, I hereby\ndeclare a State Disaster Emergency effective November 18, 2014 within the\nterritorial boundaries of the counties of Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Franklin, Genesee, Herkimer, Jefferson, Lewis, Oswego, Wyoming, and contiguous\ncounties. This Executive Order shall be in effect through December 1, 2014; and\nFURTHER, pursuant to Section 29 of Article 2-B of the\n\nExecutive Law, I direct the implementation of the State Comprehensive Emergency\n\nManagement Plan and authorize, effective November 18, 2014, the State Office of\n\nEmergency Management, the Department of Health, the Department of\n\nTransportation, the State Police, the Division of Military and Naval Affairs, the Department of Environmental Conservation, the State Department of\n\nCorrections and Community Supervision, the Public Service Commission, the\n\nOffice of Fire Prevention and Control, the Department of Labor, the Office of\n\nParks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, the Office of General Services, the State University of New York, the Thruway Authority, the Division of\n\nHomeland Security and Emergency Services, other State agencies as necessary, and the American Red Cross to take appropriate action to protect State property\nand to assist affected local governments and individuals in responding to and\nrecovering from this disaster, and to provide such other assistance as\nnecessary to protect the public health and safety.
