The Council was further directed to designate from this list, those\nconditions which it proposes to classify as rent impairing. Because of the complexity of application of the provisions\nof the Multiple Residence Law to the various classes of occupancies and the\nvarious kinds of construction the Council approved the tabular form of\npresentation to most clearly designate the applicability of the\nviolation. Although every effort was made to include all conditions\nwhich might be construed to constitute a violation of the Multiple Residence\n\nLaw, most attention was directed to those conditions which are deemed to be\ninimical to the welfare of the occupants. Descriptions of conditions contained\nin the list are worded so as to summarize the actual conditions found in some\nbuildings that violate the intent of the provisions of the Multiple Residence\n\nLaw and to suggest the corrective work necessary. The list is intended as a guide to interpretation of the\nprovisions of the Multiple Residence Law. In each case reference is made to the\napplicable section and subdivision of the Law or the rule number of the Rules\nand Regulations promulgated pursuant to the provisions of the Multiple\n\nResidence Law. In all cases for an exact wording of the provision, the Multiple\n\nResidence Law or the Rules and Regulations must be consulted. The numbered columns indicate the various classes of\noccupancies and the various kinds of construction regulated by the Multiple\n\nResidence Law. A check mark or a note within a column indicates that a\nparticular condition applies to that class and kind of multiple dwelling. In\nconnection with this applicability, it should be noted that section\n329, subdivision\n2\nof the\n\nMultiple Residence Law provides in effect that in municipalities which have\naccepted the applicability of the State Building Construction Code, the\nprovisions of articles four, five, six and seven of the Multiple Residence Law\nbecome inoperative with respect to the construction of multiple dwellings in\nsuch municipalities so long as the State Building Construction Code is\napplicable and operative. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n1262.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
