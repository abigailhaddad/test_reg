  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 9-2.3 - Computation of tax under the aggregate method\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nUnder the aggregate method, the corporation's distributive share (see IRC\nsection 704) of each partnership item of receipts, income, gain, loss, and\ndeduction and the corporation's proportionate part of each partnership asset\nand liability and each partnership activity are included in the computation of\nthe corporation's business income base, capital base, and the fixed dollar\nminimum tax and will have the same source and character in the hands of the\ncorporate partner for article 9-A purposes as such item has in t h e hands of\nthe partnership for Federal income tax purposes. Where an item, amount or\nactivity of the partnership is not characterized for Federal income tax\npurposes or is not required to be taken into account for Federal income tax\npurposes, the source and character of each item, amount or activity of the\npartnership will be determined as if such item, amount or activity realized, incurred or experienced by the partnership were realized, incurred or\nexperienced directly by the corporate partner. (2)\nA corporation's proportionate part of the\npartnership's assets and liabilities and activities is determined in accordance\nwith the corporation's capital interest in the partnership. If using a\ncorporation's capital interest in a partnership to determine the corporation's\nshare of partnership items constituting business capital and investment capital\ndoes not properly reflect the corporation's share of partnership items\nconstituting business income, investment income, and other exempt income, then\nthe corporation's proportionate part of the partnership's assets and\nliabilities and activities is determined using the percentage resulting from\nthe manner in which the partners divide the partnership's profits in a profit\nyear and losses in a loss year. (i) Example. Corporations A and B are partners in Partnership P. A\nwill perform services for a 40% interest in the profits and losses of\n\nPartnership P and B will contribute $1,000 for a 60% interest in the profits\nand losses of Partnership P. B's capital interest is 100% and A's capital\ninterest is zero. Partnership P's only asset is $500 of stock, which pays\ndividends of $30 during the taxable year. Based on capital interests, A's proportionate part of P's\nstock is zero ($500 x 0%) and B's proportionate part of P's stock is $500 ($500\nx 100%). In this case, using capital interests does not properly reflect A's\nshare of P's stock. This is because A receives 40% of P's dividends and using\ncapital interests attributes none of P's stock to A. Likewise, B receives 60%\nof P's dividends and using capital interests attributes all of P's stock to\nB. In this case, both A and B must determine their\nproportionate part of P's assets and liabilities in accordance with their\nprofits and loss interest (40% and 60%, respectively) in P. As a result, A's\ndistributive share of the dividends is $12 ($30 multiplied by 40%) and B's\ndistributive share is $18 ($30 multiplied by 60%). (3)\n(i) An\nallocation of an item, amount or activity, even if recognized for Federal\nincome tax purposes, will not be recognized where it has as a principal purpose\nthe avoidance or evasion of any tax imposed on the corporation, or the combined\ngroup of which the corporation is a member, by New York State or any of its\npolitical subdivisions. Where an allocation is not recognized, the\ncorporation's distributive share will be determined in accordance with the\npartner's interest in the partnership (determined by taking into account all\nfacts and circumstances). (ii)\n\nThe\ndetermination of whether a principal purpose of an allocation of an item, amount or activity is the avoidance or evasion of any tax imposed on the\ncorporation, or the combined group of which the corporation is a member, by New\n\nYork State or any of its political subdivisions depends on all the surrounding\nfacts and circumstances. Among the relevant circumstances to be considered are\nthe following: (a) whether the allocation has\nsubstantial economic effect; (b) whether the related items of partnership income, gain, loss, and deduction from\nthe same source are subject to the same allocation; (c) whether the allocation was made without\nrecognition of normal business factors and only after the amount of the\nallocated item could reasonably be estimated; (d) the duration of the allocation; and\n(e) the overall tax\nconsequences of the allocation. (iii)\nA special allocation to a corporate\npartner of a New York tax credit that is computed at the partnership level may\nbe allowed only if the following conditions are satisfied: (a) the sole component in the calculation of\nthe tax credit is a partnership expenditure; (b) the tax credit is allocated in the same\nway as that expenditure is allocated among the partners; (c) the allocation of the tax credit does not\nhave as a principal purpose the avoidance or evasion of any tax imposed on the\ncorporation, or the combined group of which the corporation is a member; and\n(d) the allocation of the\nexpenditure has substantial economic effect. (4)\n\nWhere a corporation is a partner in an\nupper tier partnership that is a partner in a lower tier partnership, the\nsource and character of such corporation's distributive share or proportionate\npart, as the case may be, of each partnership item of receipts, income, gain, loss, deduction, asset, liability, and activity of the upper tier partnership\nthat is attributable to the lower tier partnership retains the source and\ncharacter determined at the level of the lower tier partnership. Such source\nand character are not changed by reason of the fact that such item flows\nthrough the upper tier partnership to such partner. (b) Business income base. The corporation's\ndistributive share of each partnership item of income, gain, loss, and\ndeduction must be taken into account in the computation of entire net income\nand the business income base. These amounts must be taken into account in\ndetermining the corporation's business income, investment income, and other\nexempt income. (c) Capital base. The corporation's proportionate part of each asset and liability of the\npartnership must be taken into account in the computation of the capital base. These amounts must be taken into account when determining business capital and\ninvestment capital. The capital base does not include any amount with respect\nto the corporation's interest in the partnership itself. (d) Fixed dollar minimum. In determining the\ntax measured by the fixed dollar minimum, the corporation must use its New York\nreceipts determined in subdivision (f) of this section. (e) Small business taxpayer. For purposes of\nthe reduced rate of tax provided in section 210(1)(a) or the exemption from the\ntax measured by the capital base provided in section 210(1-c) for a small\nbusiness taxpayer, a corporation must meet the definition of a small business\ntaxpayer in section 210(1)(f). In determining whether the corporation\nqualifies, it must take into account its distributive share or proportionate\npart, as the case may be, of partnership amounts of items described in s ection\n210(1)(f). (f) Business\n\nApportionment Factor (BAF). (1)\nA corporation\nmust include its distributive share of the partnership's business receipts when\ncomputing its BAF. Its distributive share of the partnership's business\nreceipts during the applicable partnership year should be combined with the\ncorporation's own receipts for the taxable year. The corporation must apportion\nsuch combined amounts using the rules specified in section 210-A and of this\n\nSubchapter. To the extent an apportionment rule uses a fraction to determine\nthe amount of New York receipts, a corporation must include the distributive\nshare or proportionate parts of any partnership amounts with the corporation's\nown amounts in such fraction. In addition, netting of gains and losses must be\ncomputed on the combined corporation and partnership amounts. (2)\n\nWhere a corporation has receipts from\nsales to a partnership in which it is a partner, the corporation must reduce\nits receipts from its sales to the partnership by its distributive share of\nsuch purchases by the partnership. Where a partnership has receipts from sales\nto a corporation that is a partner in the partnership, the corporation does not\ninclude its distributive share of the partnership receipts from sales to the\ncorporation in its BAF. (3)\n\nExamples. In the following examples, Partnership P has two\npartners, Corporation A and Corporation B. Corporation A has a 20% interest in\nthe partnership and Corporation B has an 80% interest. There are no allocations\nof an item, amount or activity. Example 1: Corporation A's sales are $20,000,000 for the\nyear, $5,000,000 of which are made to Partnership P. Partnership P makes sales\nof $10,000,000 during the same year, none of which are to A or other partners. Corporation A determines its everywhere receipts of $21,000,000 as\nfollows: Sales by Corporation A to other entities\n$15,000,000\n\nSales by Corporation A to Partnership P\n$5,000,000\n\nLess its distributive share of Partnership P's\npurchases from Corporation A (20% x $5,000,000)\n($1,000,000)\n\nCorporation A's total sales to Partnership P\n($5,000,000 - $1,000,000)\n$4,000,000\n\nCorporation A's distributive share of\n\nPartnership P's total sales (20% x $10,000,000)\n$2,000,000\n\nCorporation A's everywhere receipts\n$21,000,000\n\nExample 2: The sales made by Corporation A, Corporation\nB, and Partnership P are as follows: Corporation A\n$20,000,000\n\nCorporation B\n$80,000,000\n\nPartnership P sales to Corporation A\n$3,000,000\n\nPartnership P sales to Corporation B\n$6,000,000\n\nPartnership P sales to unrelated Corporation\nX\n$1,000,000\n\nPartnership P's total sales\n$10,000,000\n\nCorporation A determines its everywhere receipts of\n$21,400,000 as follows: Sales by Corporation A\n$20,000,000\n\nCorporation A's distributive share of\n\nPartnership P's total sales (20% x $10,000,000)\n$2,000,000\n\nLess Corporation A's distributive share of\n\nPartnership P's sales to Corporation A (20% x $3,000,000)\n$600,000\n\nCorporation A's distributive share of\n\nPartnership P's sales\n$1,400,000\n\nCorporation A's everywhere receipts\n$21,400,000\n\nCorporation B determines its everywhere receipts of\n$83,200,000 as follows: Sales by Corporation B\n$80,000,000\n\nCorporation B's distributive share of\n\nPartnership P's total sales\n$8,000,000\n(80% x $10,000,000)\n\nLess Corporation B's distributive share of\n\nPartnership P's sales to Corporation B (80% x $6,000,000)\n$4,800,000\n\nCorporation B's distributive share of\n\nPartnership P's sales\n$3,200,000\n\nCorporation B's everywhere receipts\n$83,200,000\n(4)\n\nIn instances where an apportionment rule\nrequires the use of a fraction to compute New York receipts, the corporation\nmust use the sum of its own amounts for the taxable year and its distributive\nshare or proportionate part, as the case may be, of partnership amounts during\nthe applicable partnership year when computing such fractions. (g) Metropolitan Transportation\n\nBusiness Tax Surcharge. (1)\n\nThe corporation\ntakes into account its distributive share of the partnership's receipts and\npayroll within the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District (MCTD) and New\n\nYork State and its distributive share or proportionate part, as the case may\nbe, of the partnership's property within the MCTD and New York State in\ncomputing its MCTD apportionment percentage as required by section 209-B(2). For purposes of section 209-B(2), a corporation that is a partner in a\npartnership computes its MCTD apportionment percentage by computing the\nproperty, receipts and payroll factors as follows: (i) The average value of the corporation's\nreal and tangible personal property, owned or rented, within the MCTD plus the\naverage value of the corporation's distributive share or proportionate part, as\nthe case may be, of the partnership's real and tangible personal property, owned or rented, within the MCTD during the applicable partnership year is\ndivided by the average value of the corporation's real and tangible personal\nproperty, owned or rented, within New York State plus the average value of its\ndistributive share or proportionate part, as the case may be, of the\npartnership's real and tangible personal property, owned or rented, within New\n\nYork State during the applicable partnership year. Where a corporation has\nleased or rented real or tangible personal property to a partnership in which\nit is a partner, the corporation includes only the average value of such\nproperty in its property factor. The corporation does not include eight times\nits distributive share of the partnership's rental expense because the average\nvalue of the property is included by the corporate partner as the owner of the\nproperty. Where a corporation has leased or rented real or tangible personal\nproperty from a partnership in which it is a partner, the corporation includes\nboth its proportionate part of the average value of such property and eight\ntimes the amount of rental expense that is deemed to have been paid to the\nother partners with respect to such property. The amount of rental expense\ndeemed paid to other partners is the corporation's total rental expense paid to\nthe partnership less the corporation's distributive share of the partnership's\nrental income from such property. (ii)\n\nThe corporation's business receipts\nwithin the MCTD plus the taxpayer's distributive share of the partnership's\nbusiness receipts within the MCTD during the applicable partnership year (MCTD\nreceipts) is divided by the corporation's New York receipts determined in\nsubdivision (f) of this section. The MCTD receipts are determined using the\nrules in subdivision (f) of this section, but substituting MCTD for New York\n\nState. (iii)\n\nThe wages, salaries\nand other personal service compensation of the corporation's employees, except\ngeneral executive officers, within the MCTD plus the corporation's distributive\nshare of the wages, salaries and other personal service compensation paid by\nthe partnership to its employees, except employees of the partnership having\npartnership-wide authority or having responsibility for an entire division of\nthe partnership, within the MCTD during the applicable partnership year is\ndivided by the wages, salaries and other personal service compensation of the\ncorporation's employees, except general executive officers, within New York\n\nState plus the corporation's distributive share of the wages, salaries and\nother personal service compensation paid by the partnership to its employees, except employees of the partnership having partnership-wide authority or having\nresponsibility for an entire division of the partnership, within New York State\nduring the applicable partnership year. (2)\n\nExamples. In the following examples regarding the computation of\nthe property factor of the MCTD apportionment percentage, Partnership P has two\npartners, Corporation A and Corporation B. Corporation A has a 20% interest in\nthe partnership and Corporation B has an 80% interest. There are no allocations\nof an item, amount or activity. Example 1: Partnership P rents a building in the MCTD\nowned by corporate partner A (average value of $100,000) for $12,000 per year. Corporation A must include the average value of $100,000 for the building in\nboth the numerator and denominator of its property factor. No portion of the\nproperty's rental value is included in Corporation A's property factor. Corporation B must include $76,800 in the numerator and\ndenominator of its property factor, which is its distributive share of the\naverage value of the property rented in the MCTD by Partnership P (80% x\n$12,000 x 8). Example 2: Partnership P owns a building in the MCTD and\nrents it to Corporation A for $12,000 per year. Corporation A must include its\nproportionate part of the average value of the building, $20,000 (20% X\n$100,000), in the numerator and denominator of its property factor. In\naddition, Corporation A must include eight times the amount of rental expense\nthat is deemed to have been paid to Corporation B with respect to such property\nin the numerator and denominator of its property factor. Such expense of $9,600\nis computed by reducing Corporation A's rental expense of $12,000 paid to\n\nPartnership P by its distributive share of the partnership's rental income of\n$2,400 (20% x $12,000). Thus, the value of the building to be used in the\nnumerator and denominator of Corporation A's property factor is $96,800\n($20,000 + [8 X $9,600]). Corporation B must include its proportionate part of\nthe average value of the building, $80,000 (80% X $100,000) in the numerator\nand denominator of Corporation B's property factor. (h) In the case of a corporation\nincluded in a combined report that is filing under the aggregate method with\nrespect to a partnership interest and such partnership engages in transactions\nwith another member of the partner's combined group, the distributive share and\nproportionate amounts from such partnership are subject to the same\nintercorporate eliminations as if such transactions occurred directly between\nthe partner and the member of the partner's combined group. (i) The term \"applicable partnership year\"\nmeans any taxable year of the partnership ending within or with the taxable\nyear of the partner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
