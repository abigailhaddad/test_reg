  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 28.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Introduction. Chapter 755 of the Laws of 1987 authorized the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\nto enter into a reciprocal agreement to have this State become a member of the\n\nInternational Registration Plan. The International Registration Plan is a\nregistration reciprocity agreement among states of the United States, the\n\nDistrict of Columbia and provinces of Canada providing for a single payment of\nregistration fees on the basis of fleet distance operated in various\njurisdictions. It calls for a single license plate or set of plates and a\nsingle cab card to be issued by only one jurisdiction for each vehicle in a\nfleet registered under the plan, and so far as registration is concerned, that\nvehicle may be operated both interstate and intrastate in the appropriate\njurisdictions. Application for entry into the program was made by the\ncommissioner as provided under the plan and this State's entry was approved and\nendorsed by member jurisdictions on February 5, 1988. The International\n\nRegistration Plan, hereinafter referred to as IRP is set forth in section\n28.11\n(b) of this\n\nPart, and except as may otherwise especially be provided herein, is made a part\nof these regulations. (b) Commencement date. Registrations shall be staggered, effective the first day of\nthe month and expiring the last day of the month, 365 days (366 days in a leap\nyear) later. (c) Registration\nof vehicles under IRP. (1)\n\nVehicles\nsubject to IRP registration. A power unit that is used or intended for use in\ntwo or more member jurisdictions and which is used for the transportation of\npersons for hire, or designed, used or maintained primarily for the\ntransportation of property and: (i) has two\naxles and a gross vehicle weight or registered gross vehicle weight in excess\nof 26,000 pounds; or\n(ii)\nhas three\nor more axles, regardless of the weight; or\n(iii)\nis used in combination, when the gross\nvehicle weight of such combination exceeds 26,000 pounds. (2)\n\nOther vehicles which may be IRP\nregistered. In addition to vehicles subject to IRP registration, motor vehicles\nhaving a maximum gross weight of 26,000 pounds or less which have two axles\nwhich are used or intended for use in two or more jurisdictions which are\nmembers of IRP may be IRP registered, at the discretion of the\ncommissioner. (3)\n\nExceptions. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision, recreational vehicles, vehicles displaying restricted plates and\ngovernment-owned vehicles, are not apportionable vehicles but may be registered\nunder the plan at the option of the registrant. For the purposes of this Part, restricted plates issued by this State shall be agricultural commercial plates, special purpose commercial plates, historical plates and farm plates. (d) Effect of adoption of IRP. (1)\n\nOn registration only. The entry of this State into IRP affects the operation in\nthis State of vehicles registered in other jurisdictions and the operation in\nother jurisdictions of vehicles registered in this State with respect to\nregistration requirements. IRP does not affect any other requirements for\noperation such as fuel or truck mileage taxes, Federal heavy vehicle use tax, dimension and weight requirements or operating authority requirements. (2)\n\nGeneral effects. The following\nare the general effects that IRP has on the operation of vehicles with respect\nto registration. For the purposes of this Part, the term intrastate operation\nmeans the transportation of a person or property from one point in a\njurisdiction to another point in the same jurisdiction for hire or profit. (i) A vehicle which is IRP registered is\nentitled to operate both interstate and intrastate in the jurisdiction in which\nit is registered and in any other jurisdiction in which it it proportionally\nregistered as indicated on the cab card issued for it and usually it may\noperate interstate, but not intrastate. In jurisdictions which are not members\nof IRP. Such vehicle is not entitled to operate in any jurisdiction which is a\nmember of IRP but in which it is not proportionately registered as indicated on\nits cab card unless a trip permit has been obtained from such jurisdiction, in\nwhich case it may operate in that jurisdiction only to the extent allowed by\nthe terms of such permit. (ii)\nA\nvehicle not subject to IRP registration, and not IRP registered, is entitled to\noperate both interstate and intrastate in any jurisdiction in which it is\nregistered and usually to operate interstate, but not intrastate, in any other\njurisdiction. (iii)\nA vehicle which\nis subject to IRP registration, but which is not IRP registered, is entitled to\noperate both interstate and intrastate in any jurisdiction in which it is\nregistered. Such vehicle is not entitled to operate in any manner in any\njurisdiction which is a member of IRP unless a trip permit has been obtained\nfrom such jurisdiction, in which case it may operate in that jurisdiction only\nto the extent allowed by the terms of such permit. Such vehicle usually is\nentitled to operate interstate, but not intrastate, in any jurisdiction which\nis not a member of IRP. (3)\n\nSpecial provisions. In addition to the\ngeneral effects of IRP set forth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the\nfollowing registration provisions affect the operations of vehicles in this\n\nState as follows: (i) Many IRP member\njurisdictions issue a document (often called a hunter's permit) which provides\nfor the operation of a vehicle for up to a specified unladen weight for a\nspecified period of time. Such a permit ordinarily is issued only for a vehicle\nwhich had been operated by a lessor under an IRP registration issued to a\nlessee when such lease has expired and is issued for the purpose of permitting\nthe lessor to move his vehicle unladen until a new registration can be secured\nunder another lease or otherwise. A vehicle to which such a permit has been\nissued may be operated unladen within this State without any number plate or\ncab card only in accordance with the terms contained on such permit.
