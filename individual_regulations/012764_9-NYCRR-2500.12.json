  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2500.12 - Waiver of benefit void\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn agreement by the tenant to waive the benefit of any\nprovision of the act or this Subchapter is void; provided, however, that based\nupon a negotiated settlement between the parties and with the approval of the\ndivision, or a court of competent jurisdiction, or where a tenant is\nrepresented by counsel, a tenant may withdraw, with prejudice, any complaint\npending before the division. Such settlement shall be binding upon subsequent\ntenants. However, where the settlement encompasses surrender of occupancy by\nthe tenant or the tenant is no longer in possession of the housing\naccommodation as of the date of the settlement, such settlement shall not be\nbinding upon any subsequent tenant, except to the extent that the complaint\nbeing settled is subject to the time limitations set forth in the act and this\n\nSubchapter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n2500.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
