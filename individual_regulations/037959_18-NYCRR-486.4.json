(c) The operating certificate of any facility\nmay be revoked, suspended or limited upon a determination by the department, after a hearing in accordance with procedures set forth in Part 493 of this\n\nTitle, that the operator has failed to comply with the requirements of State or\nlocal laws or regulations applicable to the operation of such\nfacility. (d) An operating\ncertificate may be temporarily suspended or limited without a hearing for a\nperiod not in excess of 60 days upon written notice to the facility that the\ndepartment has found that the public health, or an individual's health, safety\nor welfare is in imminent danger. If the department schedules an expedited\nhearing to begin during the suspension period, in a proceeding to suspend, revoke or limit the operating certificate, as set forth in section\n493.8\nof this Title, the temporary\nsuspension will remain in effect until the hearing decision is\nissued. (e) Any order or\ndetermination to limit an operating certificate shall specify the manner in\nwhich the operating certificate is to be limited. An operating certificate may\nbe found subject to one or more of the following limitations: (1)\na limitation on the period of time for\nwhich such certificate remains effective, contingent on a determination that\nspecified violations have been corrected or specified conditions have been\nmet; (2)\na limitation on the number\nof persons for which such facility is authorized to provide care; (3)\na prohibition against the admission of\nnew residents after a specified date; or\n(4)\na limitation on the type(s) of service to\nbe provided. (f) Violations or threatened violations of law or the regulations of the\ndepartment, by any facility subject to the inspection and supervision of the\ndepartment, may be enjoined by the Supreme Court. The Attorney General may seek\nsuch an injunction, in the name of the people, upon the request of the\ndepartment. Service in such an action shall state the nature of the violation\nand shall be accomplished in the manner prescribed by the Civil Practice Law\nand Rules; provided, however, that an\nex parte\ntemporary\nrestraining order may issue, notwithstanding the Civil Practice Law and Rules, if the court finds, on motion and affidavit, that such violation may reasonably\nbe expected to result in imminent danger to the public health or to the health, safety or welfare of any individual in a facility subject to the department's\ninspection and supervision. The court, after a hearing, may issue a preliminary\ninjunction or a permanent injunction enjoining a facility from admitting new\nresidents, or directing the department and such facility to arrange for the\ntransfer of residents to other facilities, or any other injunctive relief the\ncourt may deem necessary. (g) Whenever the commission, after investigation, finds that any person, agency or\nfacility subject to this regulation is causing, engaging in or maintaining a\ncondition or activity which constitutes a danger to the physical or mental\nhealth of the residents of a facility subject to the inspection and supervision\nof the department, and that it, therefore, appears to be prejudicial to the\ninterests of such residents to delay action for 30 days until an opportunity\nfor a hearing can be provided in accordance with the provisions of this\nsection, the commissioner shall order the person, agency or facility, by\nwritten notice setting forth the basis for such finding, to discontinue such\ndangerous condition or activity or take certain action immediately or within a\nspecified period of less than 30 days. The commissioner shall, within 30 days\nof issuance of the order, provide the person, agency or facility an opportunity\nto be heard and to present any proof that such condition or activity does not\nconstitute a danger to the health of such residents. (h) Any official, operator or his agent, designee or employee of a facility who intentionally refuses to admit any\nofficer or inspector of the department, or intentionally refuses or fails to\nfurnish the information required by the department or any officer or inspector, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
