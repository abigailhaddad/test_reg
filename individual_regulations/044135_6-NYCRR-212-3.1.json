  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 212-3.1 - Reasonably Available Control Technology f or Major Facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nOwners and/or operators of facilities\nlocated in the Lower Orange County towns of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and Woodbury or New York City metropolitan area with\nan annual potential to emit of 25 tons or more of NOx or 25 tons or more of\nVOCs must comply with the requirements of this section. (2)\n\nOwners and/or operators of facilities\nlocated outside of the Lower Orange County towns of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and Woodbury and New York City metropolitan\narea with an annual potential to emit of 100 tons or more of NOx or 50 tons or\nmore of VOCs must comply with the requirements of this section. (3)\n\nOwners and/or operators of facilities\nlocated in the Lower Orange County towns of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and Woodbury or New York City metropolitan area with\nan annual potential to emit of 25 tons or more of nitrogen oxides or facilities\nlocated outside of the Lower Orange County towns of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and Woodbury or New York City metropolitan\narea with an annual potential to emit 100 tons or more of nitrogen oxides may\npetition the EPA for an exemption from the RACT requirements for NOx emission\npoints in this section. The facility is eligible for the exemption if the owner\nand/or operator demonstrates that net o zone air quality benefits are greater\nin the absence of reductions of NOx from the facility. Nothing in this\nparagraph shall exempt owners and/or operators of facilities that petition the\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency for an exemption from complying with the\napplicable requirements of this section by the May 31, 1995 deadline absent\napproval of the exemption. (b) Owners and/or operators of emission\npoints subject to this Part that emit NOx or VOCs located at facilities\ndescribed in Subdivision (a) of this Section must submit a compliance plan to\nthe department by October 20, 1994. The compliance plan must either include the\nRACT analysis required by Subdivision (c) of this Section or a plan to limit\nthe annual potential to emit below the applicability levels pursuant to\n\nSubdivision (d) of this Section. (c) (1)\n\nThe compliance plan must identify RACT\nfor each emission point that emits NOx for major NOx facilities or VOC for\nmajor VOC facilities. The compliance plan must identify the emission points\nthat do not employ RACT, and a schedule for implementation of RACT must be\nincluded in the plan. A RACT analysis is not required for emission points with\nNOx and VOC emission rate potentials less than 3.0 pounds per hour and actual\nemissions in the absence of control equipment less than 15.0 pounds per day at\nfacilities located in the Lower Orange County towns of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and Woodbury and New York City metropolitan\narea. A RACT analysis is not required for emission points with NOx and VOC\nemission rate potentials less than 3.0 pounds per hour at facilities located\noutside of the Lower Orange County towns of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and Woodbury and New York City metropolitan area. RACT\nas approved by the department must be implemented on each emission point\nsubject to this section by May 31, 1995. (2)\n\nCompliance plans that include\nconstruction of emission control equipment must include a mile stone date no\nlater than December 20, 1994 for submission of a permit to operate to the\ndepartment for emission control equipment. The compliance plans must include\nmilestone dates for commencement of construction, completion of construction, and completion of emissions testing of emission control equipment. (3)\nRACT compliance plans for NOx emission\npoints must include technically feasible control strategies to minimize NOx\nformation and emission control equipment alternatives. These process specific\nRACT demonstrations that are acceptable to the department will be submitted to\nthe United States Environmental Protection Agency for approval as a revision to\nthe State Implementation Plan by the department. (4)\n(i) VOC\nemission points that are equipped with a capture system and a control device\nwith an overall removal efficiency of at least 81 percent are equipped with\nreasonably available control technology. (ii)\n\nSurface coating processes that are not\nsubject to Part 228 of this Title which use a surface coating with a maximum\nVOC content of 3.5 pounds VOC per gallon as applied (minus water and excluded\nVOC) as calculated according to the formula in Section 228.2(b)(11) of this\n\nTitle are equipped with RACT. (iii)\n\nWhere the facility owner or operator can show to the satisfaction of the\ndepartment that an emission point cannot achieve an overall removal efficiency\nof 81 percent or use coatings not exceeding 3.5 pounds VOC per gallon as\napplied (minus water and excluded VOC) for reasons of technological or economic\nfeasibility, the department may accept a lesser degree of control upon\nsubmission of satisfactory evidence that the facility owner or operator will\napply reasonably available control technology. These process specific RACT\ndemonstrations that are acceptable to the department will b e submitted to the\nEPA for approval as a revision to the State Implementation Plan by the\ndepartment. (d) The owner or operator of any facility\nwith federally and state enforceable conditions in a permit to operate that\nlimits its annual potential to emit NOx and VOCs below the applicability levels\nof Subdivision (a) of this Section by May 31, 1995 is exempt from the RACT\nanalysis and implementation requirements of this Section. Records must be\nmaintained by the owner or operator at the facility on a monthly basis which\nverify the facility's annual actual emissions. Upon reasonable request, these\nrecords must be submitted to the department in a format acceptable to the\ndepartment. An exceedance o f the annual potential to emit conditions for any\ncalendar year must be reported by the owner or operator to the department\nwithin 30 days of the end of that calendar year. (e) Any facility that is subject to this\nsection after May 31, 1995 will remain subject to these provisions even if the\nannual potential to emit NOx or VOCs later fall below the applicability\nthreshold. (f) Owners and/or\noperators of emission points located at facilities described in Subdivision (a)\nof this Section that commence construction after August 15, 1994 must submit a\nRACT demonstration for nitrogen oxides and VOC emissions with each application\nfor a permit to operate. RACT must be implemented on these emission points when\noperation commences. A RACT analysis is not required for new emission points\nwith NOx and VOC emission rate potentials less than 3.0 pounds per hour and\nactual emissions in the absence of control equipment less than 15.0 pounds per\nday at facilities located outside of the Lower Orange County towns of Blooming\n\nGrove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and Woodbury and New York\n\nCity metropolitan area.
