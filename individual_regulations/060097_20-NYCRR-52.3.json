In the event\nthat such dealer uses a clearing agent and also duly appoints such agent to act\nfor him in the payment of the tax without the use of stamps, then only said\nagent shall remit the tax. The appointment of every such agent shall be subject\nto the written approval of the commissioner. An election to pay the tax without\nthe use of stamps shall be made by a notice in writing filed by such dealer\nwith the commissioner. Such notice shall state: (1)\nthat on and after a specified date the\ndealer will pay the tax to the commissioner without the use of\nstamps; (2)\nthe date of the\ndealer's registration with the Attorney-General of the State of New York as a\ndealer in securities; and\n(3)\nthe\nname and address of the agent of the dealer, if any, who will act as clearing\nagent and who will remit the tax on behalf of the dealer. An election once made shall be irrevocable, except with the\nwritten consent of the commissioner, and except that if any dealer becomes an\neligible member of an authorized corporation as defined in section\n52.4\nof this Part and is thereby required to pay taxes to such corporation, his\nelection to pay taxes pursuant to this section shall be thereby terminated. The\ncommissioner may at any time withdraw from any dealer the privilege of paying\nthe tax without stamps. Written notice of the termination of the authority of\nany such agent shall be given immediately to the commissioner. Any stamps\nlawfully in the possession of a dealer at the time his election becomes\neffective shall be subject to redemption under the law pertaining thereto and\nshall not be used as part payment of the tax due from such\ndealer. (b) Every\ndealer shall make a weekly report to the commissioner on a form prescribed by\nthe commissioner for such purpose. In the event that the commissioner has\napproved the appointment of an agent to remit the tax on a dealer's behalf, then said agent shall make the said weekly report for such dealer. Where an\nagent acts on behalf of more than one dealer a separate report for each dealer\nmust be made. The report shall show the daily amount of stock transfer taxes\npayable on all sales and transfers due for settlement within the period for\nwhich the report is filed, and such other information as the commissioner may\nrequire. Additionally, the report shall show the amount of the rebate of tax\ndue, as provided for in section\n280-a (6)\nof the Tax Law. Such report shall be mailed or delivered to the appropriate address as\nindicated on the form. The report shall be due not later than the second\nbusiness day of the week following that for which the report is made. Every\ndealer shall remit to the commissioner quarterly any taxes due, in accordance\nwith the provisions of paragraph (6) of subdivision (b) of section\n280-a\nof the Tax Law. Checks payable to\nthe commissioner may be used in making remittances. (c) Every dealer executing or effecting a\nsale or transfer where the tax will be paid without the use of stamps shall\nimpress, by rubber stamp, on the memorandum of sale for each transaction a\ndated certification stating that the applicable tax will be paid directly to\nthe commissioner and bearing the facsimile signature of such dealer. If the\ndealer employs a clearing agent for its transactions, such certification shall\ninstead include the statement that the applicable tax will be paid directly to\nthe commissioner for the account of the dealer and shall bear the facsimile\nsignatures of both the dealer and its clearing agent. Such rubber stamp shall be kept in the possession of the\ndealer or agent (if applicable) and used only by such person or such person's\nauthorized representative. (d) A certificate of stock or other corporate\ncertificate which is presented for transfer shall, if the tax will be paid\nother than by the use of stamps, be accompanied by a memorandum of sale bearing\nthe stamped statement described in subdivision (c) of this section, or there\nshall be impressed upon it, by rubber stamp, a certification stating the number\nof shares transferred and that the applicable tax on such shares will be paid\ndirectly to the commissioner. Such certification shall bear the printed name of\nthe dealer and the facsimile signature of such dealer. If the dealer employs a\nclearing agent for its transactions, such certification shall also bear the\nfacsimile signature of the dealer's clearing agent. Such rubber stamp shall be\nkept in the possession of the dealer or agent (if applicable) and used only by\nsuch person or such person's authorized representative. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
