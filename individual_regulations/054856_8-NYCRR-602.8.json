(6)\n\nFull-time equivalent\nfaculty. One full-time faculty position. To ascertain full-time\nequivalent faculty, divide the total class hours taught at the college, including classroom hours and laboratory hours, by the average classroom and\nlaboratory hours taught by the college's full-time faculty, excluding overload\nhours taught for extra compensation. Full-time faculty\nfor\nthis purpose is defined as all personnel holding faculty rank and being paid on\na full-time basis, with the exclusion of: (i) persons assigned to perform nonteaching functions including, for example, personnel holding the title of president, vice-president, dean, librarian, registrar or student counselor; (ii)\npersonnel holding the title of, or\nformally designated to function as academic department heads, not to exceed one\nper department; and\n(iii)\nfaculty\nmembers granted release time of at least six credit hours per semester to\nundertake duties required under the terms of a grant or contract funded by an\noutside agency; provided, however, that such release time is accompanied by an\nequivalent reduction in salary or an offsetting recovery of revenues by the\ncollege.
