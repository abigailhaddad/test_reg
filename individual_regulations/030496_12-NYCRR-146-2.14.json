Tit. 12 §§ 146-2.14 - Tip sharing and tip pooling\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Tip sharing\nis the practice by which a directly tipped\nemployee gives a portion of his or her tips to another service employee or food\nservice worker who participated in providing service to customers and keeps the\nbalance. (b) Tip\npooling\nis the practice by which the tip earnings of directly tipped\nemployees are intermingled in a common pool and then redistributed among\ndirectly and indirectly tipped employees. (c) Directly tipped\nemployees\nare those who receive tips from patrons or customers without\nany intermediary between the patron or customer and the employee. (d) Indirectly tipped\nemployees\nare those employees who, without receiving direct tips, are\neligible to receive shared tips or to receive distributions from a tip\npool. (e) Eligibility of employees\nto receive shared tips, or to receive distributions from a tip pool, shall be\nbased upon duties and not titles. Eligible employees must perform, or assist in\nperforming, personal service to patrons at a level that is a principal and\nregular part of their duties and is not merely occasional or incidental.
