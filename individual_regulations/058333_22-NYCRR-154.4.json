  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 154.4 - Action by OCA\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon receipt of an exemption\nrequest pursuant to section\n154.3\nof this Part, OCA shall\nreview the material filed to determine whether the exemption request shall be\ngranted. The factors OCA shall consider in determining an exemption request\nshall include, but not be limited to, the following statutory factors: (1)\nthe nature and the size of\nthe client; (2)\nwhether the client has any business before the state; and, if so, how\nsignificant the business is; and whether the client has any particularized\ninterest in pending legislation and if so how significant the interest\nis; (3)\nwhether\ndisclosure may reveal trade secrets; (4)\nwhether disclosure could reasonably\nresult in retaliation against the client; (5)\nwhether disclosure may cause undue\nharm to the client; (6)\nwhether disclosure may result in\nundue harm to the attorney-client relationship; and\n(7)\nwhether disclosure may\nresult in an unnecessary invasion of privacy to the client. (b) In reviewing an\nexemption request, OCA may consult with bar or other professional associations, or with the Commission or the Legislative Ethics Commission for individuals\nsubject to its jurisdiction, and may consider the rules of professional\nconduct. (c) OCA\nshall grant the exemption request upon a finding that, under the totality of\nthe circumstances, the interests in nondisclosure of the client information\n(including the general interests served by principles of client\nconfidentiality) outweigh the interests served by disclosure; otherwise it\nshall deny the request. OCA shall provide the applicant with a written\nexplanation of its determination, which shall clearly state that such\ndetermination is based solely upon the information furnished by the applicant\nin support of his or her exemption request and that, upon any subsequent change\nin such information, the determination may be reconsidered as provided in this\n\nPart. The OCA determination shall neither address nor alter the applicant's\ndisclosure or confidentiality obligations under any law or authority other than\n\nPublic Officers Law § 73-a. (d) OCA shall determine an exemption\nrequest not later than three days following the day on which such request is\nreceived; provided, however, where the last of such days is a Saturday, Sunday\nor a public holiday, OCA may render its determination on the next succeeding\nbusiness day as provided by the General Construction Law. When the request\ncontains information deemed insufficient for the rendering of a determination, OCA may direct the applicant to provide additional information in a further\nsubmission, whereupon it shall render its determination within three business\ndays from receipt of such additional information. (e) Where OCA denies an\nexemption request, and thereafter there occurs a material change of facts or\ncircumstances - including a change in the applicant's title or duties, a change\nin the nature of the services provided to the client, or a change in the nature\nof such client's business - an applicant may seek reconsideration of that\ndenial by following the procedures set forth in section\n154.3. (f) Where OCA grants an\nexemption request, it shall be unnecessary for the applicant to make the same\nrequest in subsequent years, except that the applicant shall thereafter\nannually review the application submitted in support of the exemption request\nto determine whether there has been a material change in the facts and\ncircumstances reported in such application - including a change in the facts\nattested pursuant to section\n154.3\n(c) of this\nrule; or in the scope of the services provided by an applicant to the client; or in the applicant's title, responsibilities, or assignments. In the event of\nsuch change, the applicant shall promptly report that change to OCA, which may, in appropriate cases, withdraw the exemption. Where OCA withdraws an exemption\npursuant to this subdivision, OCA shall provide the applicant with a written\nexplanation for such action. (g) Determinations pursuant to this\n\nPart shall not be deemed judicial determinations and shall not be subject to\njudicial review except as may otherwise be authorized by law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
