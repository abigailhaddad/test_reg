Tit. 8 § 535.8 - Communication\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn matters of the sort to which these rules are\naddressed, full and prompt communication among all components of the\ninstitutional community, faculty, students and administration, is highly\ndesirable. To the extent that time and circumstances permit, such communication\nshould precede the exercise of the authority, discretion and responsibilities\ngranted and imposed in these rules. To these ends each State-operated\ninstitution of the State University shall employ such procedures and means, formal and informal, as will promote such communication. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8\n§\n535.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
