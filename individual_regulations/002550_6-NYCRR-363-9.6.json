  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-9.6 - Post-closure care & custodial care\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Post-closure care. A facility's\npost-closure care period continues until the owner or operator can demonstrate\nto the department's satisfaction that the threat to public health and the\nenvironment has been reduced to a level where environmental monitoring and\nmaintenance can be reduced. (1)\n\nOperating\nrequirements. In lieu of the operating requirements set forth in section\n360.19\nof this Title, all closed\nlandfills regulated under this Part which are within their post-closure care\nperiod must conform to the operation requirements in this section, unless\notherwise approved by the Department based on unique circumstances associated\nwith the landfill. (i) Maintenance of all\nslopes, vegetation, drainage structures, gas venting structures, access roads, fencing and gates is required. (ii)\n\nMaintenance of the integrity and effectiveness of any final cover, including\nmaking repairs to the cover as necessary to correct the effects of settlement, subsidence, erosion, or other events, and preventing run-on and run-off from\neroding or otherwise damaging the final cover. (iii)\n\nVegetative cover must be established on\nall final cover areas within four months after placement. If this cannot be\nachieved due to seasonal constraints, measures must be taken to ensure the\nintegrity of the final cover system until the establishment of vegetative\ncover. Throughout the post-closure care period, the vegetative cover must be\nmaintained and must be mowed at least once a year, unless otherwise approved by\nthe department. (iv)\n\nEnvironmental\nand facility monitoring points, including gas monitoring points, must be\nmaintained and sampled. This must include: (a) post-closure explosive gas monitoring to\ndetermine if the facility meets the requirements of subdivision\n363-7.1\n(e) of this\n\nPart at least quarterly for a minimum period of five years. After this\nfive-year period, the permittee may request that the department modify the\nsampling and analysis requirements. If post-closure explosive gas monitoring\nindicates explosive gas levels exceed the requirements of subdivision\n363-7.1\n(e) of this\n\nPart, appropriate actions must be taken and the department must be notified\nwithin 24 hours; (b) annual\nbaseline and quarterly routine monitoring as described in section\n363-4.6\nof this Part must be\nperformed on groundwater, surface water, and leachate samples for the duration\nof the post-closure period. The owner or operator may petition the department\nfor a reduction in monitoring frequency after five years of post-closure\nmonitoring; and\n(c) a description\nof type and location of sampling, sample preservation methodology, a well\ncondition survey, and recordkeeping and reporting requirements for all\nenvironmental monitoring activities. (v) The leachate collection system must be\nmaintained and operated in accordance with section\n363-7.1\n(f) and (g)\nof this Part. Leachate management activities include proper maintenance of all\nleachate controls, recording of the total volume of leachate stored at and\nremoved from the facility, evaluation of liner performance, and leachate\nsampling and analysis. (vi)\n\nAny\ninstalled active landfill gas collection system must be maintained and operated\nin accordance with section\n363-7.1\n(e). (vii)\n\nQuarterly inspections and inspections\nafter seismic events of sufficient intensity which may adversely affect the\nintegrity of the final cover system and major rainfall events (all 24-hour, five-year storms) must be performed on all facility components during the\npost-closure care period. (viii)\n\nAny end use of the property must not disturb the integrity of the final cover, liners, any other components of the containment system, or the function of the\nmonitoring or environmental control systems. (ix)\n\nAn annual report must be submitted as\nrequired by section\n360.19\nof this Title, and must\ninclude the results of maintenance, monitoring, quarterly inspections, and\ninspections after seismic events of sufficient intensity which may adversely\naffect the integrity of the final cover system and major rainfall events\nrequired in this subdivision. (x) A\nreport that includes all sampling and analysis results for all environmental\nand facility monitoring must be submitted at a frequency specified in\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. (xi)\n\nThe landfill must maintain financial\nassurance in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of post-closure care, custodial care, and corrective measures, if required, as specified by this\n\nSubpart and section\n360.22\nof this Title. (2)\n\nPost-closure care plan. The\nowner or operator must submit a final post-closure care plan to the department\nfor approval prior to the last receipt of waste and at least every five years\nduring the post-closure care period. The plan must provide: (i) a description of the actions to be taken\nto implement paragraph (1) of this subdivision as appropriate; (ii)\na description of resource requirements\nincluding: (a) minimum number of personnel and\nrequired qualifications; and\n(b) minimum equipment needs; (iii)\nthe name, address and telephone number\nof the person or office to contact regarding post-closure care, and corrective\nmeasures concerns during the post-closure period; (iv)\na summary of financial assurance\ncriteria that must be addressed to remain in compliance with the provisions of\nsection\n360.22\nof this Title; (v) a description of the planned uses of the\nproperty during and after the post-closure period; and\n(vi)\na list of any changes to the approved\npost-closure plan by topic, author, date of submittal, and date approved by the\ndepartment from the time of original closure plan approval. (b) Custodial care. A\nfacility's custodial care period begins when the owner or operator demonstrates\nto the department's satisfaction that the facility poses a significantly\nreduced threat to public health and the environment and that environmental\nmonitoring and maintenance can be reduced. (1)\n\nOperating requirements. In lieu of the\noperating requirements set forth in section\n360.19\nof this Title, all closed\nlandfills regulated under this Part, which are within their custodial care\nperiod, must conform to the operation requirements in this section, unless\notherwise approved by the Department based on unique circumstances associated\nwith the landfill. (i) Maintenance of all\nslopes, vegetation, drainage structures, gas venting structures, access roads, fencing and gates is required. (ii)\n\nMaintenance of the integrity and effectiveness of any final cover, including\nmaking repairs to the cover as necessary to correct the effects of settlement, subsidence, erosion, or other events, and preventing run-on and run-off from\neroding or otherwise damaging the final cover. (iii)\n\nVegetative cover must be maintained and\nmust be mowed at least once a year, unless otherwise approved by the\ndepartment. (iv)\n\nEnvironmental and\nfacility monitoring points must be maintained and sampled. This must include: (a) baseline monitoring, as described in\nsection\n363-4.6\nof this Part, which must be\nperformed on groundwater, surface water, and leachate samples once every five\nyears; and\n(b) a description of\ntype and location of sampling, sample preservation methodology, a well\ncondition survey, and recordkeeping and reporting requirements for all\nenvironmental monitoring activities. (v) The gas venting system must be maintained\nand operated. If odors constitute a nuisance as determined by the department, an active gas collection system must be operated. (vi)\n\nAnnual inspections and inspections after\nseismic events of sufficient intensity which may adversely affect the integrity\nof the final cover system and major rainfall events (24-hour, five-year storms)\nmust be performed on all facility components. (vii)\n\nAn annual report must be submitted as\nrequired by 360.19, and must include the results of all maintenance, monitoring, and inspection activities as well as proposed changes to end\nuse. (viii)\n\nThe landfill must\nmaintain financial assurance in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of\ncustodial care and corrective measures, if required, as specified by this\n\nSubpart and section\n360.22\nof this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nCustodial care\nplan. The owner or operator must submit a final custodial care plan to the\ndepartment upon determination that the landfill's post-closure period is\ncomplete. The custodial care plan at a minimum must provide: (i) a description that documents actions to\nbe taken to implement paragraph (1) of this subdivision assuring the\neffectiveness and reliability of the components of the landfill's waste\ncontainment system and appurtenances and associated end use controls that have\nbeen determined necessary to protect public health and the\nenvironment; (ii)\na description of\nsupport requirements necessary to implement the custodial care plan, including: (a) minimum number of personnel and required\nqualifications; (b) minimum\nequipment needs; (iii)\nthe name, address and telephone number of the person or office to contact\nregarding custodial care, and corrective measures concerns during the custodial\ncare period; and\n(iv)\na summary of\nfinancial assurance criteria that must be addressed to remain in compliance\nwith the provisions of section\n360.22\nof this Title.
