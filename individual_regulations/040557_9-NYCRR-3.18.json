  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.18 - Executive Order No. 18: [Establishing Citizen Mobilization for Federal Action Board.]\nState Regulations\n\nThe City of New York faces a dire fiscal emergency, as\nfound and declared by the Legislature of the State of New York in Extraordinary\n\nSession on September 8, 1975. This emergency has far-reaching economic and\nsocial consequences for every municipality in the State and Nation. In response\nto New York City's fiscal crisis, the State of New York has extended support to\nthe City, at substantial risks to the [\ncontinued\n] State. Unfortunately, the State can no longer stretch its resources any further\nwithout seriously impairing its own financial position. Indeed, alarming signs\nalready exist that the State's efforts have adversely affected the credit of\nthe State. Federal support is the last resort available to avert the national\neconomic disaster certain to follow a financial collapse of the City of New\n\nYork. To spur Federal action, there must be a national awareness\nof the City's plight, of the City's and State's comprehensive rescue efforts, of the potential national impact of City default and of the Federal\nresponsibility in this regard. Many groups in the State are already organized and actively\ninvolved on relevant fronts to assist the City. These groups, however, require\ncoordination and technical assistance in order to maximize their\nefforts. Accordingly, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of New\n\nYork, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the Laws\nof the State of New York, by Executive Order, do hereby establish in the\n\nExecutive Department a board to be known as the Citizen Mobilization for\n\nFederal Action, to recommend federal action programs meeting the urgent needs\nof the City of New York, to coordinate the efforts of all private organizations\nand groups seeking to obtain Federal assistance for the City, to serve as the\n\nState's representative and liaison with all business, industry, labor, civic\nand community groups and private individuals striving to assist the City in\norder to prevent its economic collapse, and to perform such other related\nfunctions as the Governor may assign to it. To provide the necessary leadership for such Board, I\nhereby appoint Robert F. Wagner as Director of the Citizen Mobilization for\n\nFederal Action, to report directly to me. In carrying out its functions, powers and duties, the Board\nshall, to the extent feasible, make use of the resources of existing State\ndepartments, divisions, agencies, and public authorities, including the\npersonnel thereof, and such entities are hereby directed to provide such\nspecific resources and personnel as are requested by the Board's Director. In\naddition to the foregoing, the Director may employ such additional personnel as\nhe deems necessary and desirable to fulfill the functions of the office and\nprovide them with compensation within the amounts available therefor. Signed: Hugh L. Carey\n\nDated: October 15, 1975\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n3.18\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
