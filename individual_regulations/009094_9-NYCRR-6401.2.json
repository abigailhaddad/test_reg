  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6401.2 - Grounds for appeal\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Limitation of grounds. There are only three grounds upon which an applicant may\nbase an appeal, as set forth below. An applicant must state in writing which of\nthese grounds it is relying upon in making an appeal. The applicant must state\nin detail the facts which make applicable the particular ground for appeal. This statement constitutes the materials, within the meaning of section\n6401.1\n(f) of this\n\nPart and is to be submitted in accordance with section\n6401.3\n(d). One, two or all three grounds may be alleged. The three grounds are: (1)\n\nNonpresentation of information. Information which an applicant made known to the council staff prior to the\ncouncil's program request decision was not presented to the council and which, if presented, might have altered the council's decision. (2)\n\nMisrepresentation of information. Information which an applicant made known to the council staff prior to the\ncouncil's program request decision was distorted in its presentation to the\ncouncil and which, if presented fairly, might have altered the council's\ndecision. (3)\n\nImproper procedure. The two possible bases for asserting this ground are (i) the review of the\nprogram request by the appropriate advisory panel was biased; or (ii) the\nprogram request decision of the council was arbitrary and capricious. (b) Single appeal. An applicant is\nentitled to only one appeal for each program request. (c) No further appeal. No appeal may be taken\nfrom a decision of the council regarding an appeal. (d) Unresolved appeal. The existence of an\nunresolved appeal shall not preclude an applicant from making a program request\nin a subsequent year. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n6401.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
