No dry cleaning\nmachine shall be installed or reinstalled after March 1, 1966 unless it is\napproved, nor shall any dry cleaning machine installed or reinstalled after\n\nMarch 1, 1966 be exposed for operation unless it is approved. (b) Installation plans. After March 1, 1966\nany installation or material change of installation of a dry cleaning machine\nshall be made only in accordance with plans and specifications accepted as\nsufficient by the commissioner. Plans and specifications shall show: (1)\nbuilding address and location of the\nmachine in the building; (2)\nmanufacturer's name; (3)\nmachine\nmodel designation; (4)\ntypes of\nsolvents to be used; (5)\ndetails of\nproposals for compliance with this Part (rule); (6)\ndetails of proposals for compliance with\nrelevant provisions of Industrial Code Parts 12 and 18 (Industrial Code Rules\n\nNos. 12 and 18); (7)\nsuch further\ninformation as may be specifically required by the commissioner to determine\nwhether the proposed installation or change may endanger the lives, health or\nsafety of employees or other persons. (c) Service areas. (1)\n\nService area required. A service area\nshall be provided for servicing and maintenance. (2)\n\nEnclosures and openings. A service area\nshall be separated by a solid enclosure from all areas open to customers, except where necessary for access and ventilation. Access openings shall be\nkept tightly closed when not in actual use and ventilation openings shall be so\narranged as to prevent the intermixture of the atmospheres of the service and\ncustomer areas. (3)\n\nVentilation. A\nservice area shall be mechanically ventilated so as to prevent the formation of\ndangerous air contaminants in the work atmosphere. (4)\n\nAdmission. No owner shall suffer or\npermit a customer or other unauthorized person to enter a service\narea. (5)\n\nFloors. The floor of a\nservice area shall be impervious to the solvents used and to water. The service\narea floor beneath each machine or group of machines shall be curbed to a\nheight sufficient to retain the entire volume of solvent or solution in the\nmachine or group of machines within the service area. Each curbed area shall be\nprovided with adequate means for drainage which will prevent flow into the\ncustomer area. Machines equipped with catch basins may warrant variation from\nthis curbing requirement upon application to the board. (6)\n\nFlames, etc. Flames and surfaces hotter\nthan 750 degrees Fahrenheit are prohibited in a service area unless sealed from\nall contact with the atmosphere therein. (d) Containment of air contaminants. A dry\ncleaning machine shall be so constructed and shall operate in such a manner\nthat no dangerous air contaminants resulting from its operation are released\ninto any occupied area. (e) Loading\ndoors. Loading doors shall be so interlocked and arranged that the machine\ncannot operate unless the door is firmly closed and so that the door cannot be\nreleased by the user until the operating cycle has been completed. Such doors\nshall be airtight when closed. (f) Drying. The drying part of the operating cycle shall continue for such time and\nunder such conditions that solvent and solvent vapors are removed from the\ncleaned materials to the extent that no dangerous air contaminants are caused\nin the atmosphere of the customer area by or upon removal of the\nmaterials. (g) Gas heated\nappliances. Gas heated appliances in a room where a dry cleaning machine is\nlocated shall be properly vented to outdoors by pipes or ducts of rigid and\ncorrosion-resistant material. (h) Spotting solvents. Spotting solvents other than aqueous solutions shall not be\nused or provided in an area where a dry cleaning machine is located. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
