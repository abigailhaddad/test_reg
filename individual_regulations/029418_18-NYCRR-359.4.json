This subdivision\nwill not apply in instances in which the social services district has received\nprior notification from the district attorney or other equivalent prosecutor\nthat the amount of any overpayment or over-issuance determined by the district\nto exist is less than the amount which the appropriate official has deemed\nsufficient for prosecution, provided that the social services district has not\nbeen notified by any other prosecutor authorized to act on the matter that such\nprosecutor intends or desires to prosecute such matter. The office may not\nreverse a determination following an administrative disqualification hearing\nfor lack of compliance with the provisions of this subdivision. (b) Disqualification consent agreement (DCA). (1)\nA DCA must be in a format prescribed by\nthe department and must include: (i) notification to the accused individual of the consequences of signing the\nagreement and consenting to a disqualification penalty; (ii)\na statement for the accused individual\nto sign indicating that he or she understands the consequences of signing the\nagreement, along with a statement that any caretaker relative or head of\nhousehold must also sign the agreement if the accused individual is not the\ncaretaker relative or head of household; (iii)\na statement that signing the agreement\nwill result in disqualification of the accused individual and reduction or\ndiscontinuance of assistance or food stamps for the disqualification period, even if the accused individual was not found guilty of civil or criminal\nmisrepresentation or fraud; (iv)\na\nstatement describing the disqualification period which will be imposed as a\nresult of the accused individual's signing the agreement; and\n(v) a statement that the remaining members of\nthe household or assistance unit, if any, will be held responsible for\nrepayment of the overpayment or over-issuance, unless the accused individual\nhas already repaid the overpayment or over-issuance as a result of meeting the\nterms of any agreement with the prosecutor or any court order. (2)\n\nWhen a case is referred in\naccordance with this section to the appropriate district attorney, or to any\nother prosecutor authorized to act on the matter, and is accepted for\nprosecution, the prosecutor may choose to settle the case or a court of\nappropriate jurisdiction hearing the case may issue a pre-determination\ndisposition order, such as an order adjourning the case in contemplation of\ndismissal, provided that full restitution is made. In such cases, the social\nservices district may use a DCA as described in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nSocial services\ndistricts which contemplate the use of DCA's must enter into written agreements\nwith the appropriate prosecutors which give the social services districts\nopportunity to send advance written notification of the consequences of signing\na DCA to the assistance unit or household when deferred adjudication is\ncontemplated. (4)\n\nIf the prosecutor\nrequests or authorizes a social services district to assist in obtaining a DCA\nas described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, a copy of the DCA, together\nwith the notification of the consequences of signing the DCA as described in\nsubparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision must be provided to the accused\nindividual at least 10 days prior to the execution of the DCA and the accused\nindividual must be advised that he or she may obtain a legal or other\nauthorized representative for counsel and advice prior to and at the time the\nDCA is executed by such accused individual.
