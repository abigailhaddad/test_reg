(21)\n(i) State whether the issuer or other\nofferor shall have sole control over the management and affairs of the theatrical production company. Set forth whether the issuer or other offeror, his affiliates, relatives or entities in which he has any interest, will engage in transactions with the theatrical production company or any\nproduction or supply goods and services to it. Such disclosure should include, but not necessarily be limited to, such transactions as agreements to\npay or payments of management or producers' fees; the furnishing of office facilities, commonly referred to as \"cash office charge\"; the supplying of\ntheatre facilities, electrical equipment, drapes and props; transactions in regard to the publication or sale of souvenir programs or show albums, as\nwell as the furnishing of personal services such as those of stage director, press agent, etc.; and the purchasing or leasing from the production\ncompany of subsidiary rights in the play or road and second company rights.

Where no intention has been formed as to whether the producer will\nengage in such transactions, there should be a statement as to the producer's right to enter into such transactions with the theatrical production\ncompany and a statement that no intention has yet been formed as to whether or not such transactions shall actually take place, and a further\nstatement of whether or not the terms of such transaction shall be reasonable and reflect prevailing industry norms. There need not be a statement as\nto the producer's right to acquire subsidiary, road or second company rights in the play if all investors are to be offered an opportunity to\nparticipate in such acquisition on terms at least as favorable and in the same proportionate interest as they have in the theatrical production\ncompany.
