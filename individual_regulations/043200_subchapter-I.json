  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, ch. I, subch. I - Cigarette Tax, Cigarette Marketing Standards And Tobacco Products Tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nArticle 1 - Cigarette Tax (Part 70 to 79)\n\nArticle 2 - Cigarette Marketing Standards (Part 80 to 88)\n\nArticle 3 - Tobacco Products Tax (Part 89 to 90)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, ch. I, subch. I\nParts 70 through 89 contained in this Subchapter were\nrenumbered as part of a reorganization of the department's regulations. These\n\nParts were previously Parts 330 through 348 and Part 350. The rule making which\nrenumbered these Parts did not make substantive changes and did not seek to\nincorporate intervening changes in the law. The regulations should be read in\nconjunction with current law. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
