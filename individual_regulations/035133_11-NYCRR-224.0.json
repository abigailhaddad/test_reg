  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 224.0 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Insurance Law article 24 permits the superintendent to regulate trade practices in the business of insurance to prevent acts or practices that are unfair or deceptive. The Insurance Law, including sections 2103, 2104, 2110, 2123 and 2208, establishes standards of conduct for insurance producers, including that producers must act in a competent and trustworthy manner. The Insurance Law, including Article 42, also establishes standards of conduct for insurers, including fraternal benefit societies. (b) This Part clarifies the duties and obligations of insurers, including fraternal benefit societies, by requiring them to establish standards and procedures for recommendations to consumers with respect to policies delivered or issued for delivery in this state so that any transaction with respect to those policies is in the best interest of the consumer and appropriately addresses the insurance needs and financial objectives of the consumer at the time of the transaction. This Part also clarifies the nature and extent of supervisory controls that an insurer must maintain to achieve compliance with this Part. (c) This Part further clarifies the duties and obligations of producers when making recommendations to consumers with respect to policies delivered or issued for delivery in this state to help ensure that a transaction is in the best interest of the consumer and appropriately addresses the insurance needs and financial objectives of the consumer at the time of the transaction. The best interest standard set forth in this Part requires a producer, or insurer where no producer is involved, to adhere to a standard of conduct to be enforced by the superintendent, but does not guarantee or warrant an outcome.
