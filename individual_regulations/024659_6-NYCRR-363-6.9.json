  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.9 - Geocushion material\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn appropriately designed and specified geocushion of\nsufficient weight to prevent deformation and damage must be placed above any\ngeomembrane. (a) Materials\nrequirements. Needle-punched, nonwoven geocushion material must be used. Documentation must be provided by the manufacturer indicating that each roll\nhas been inspected at the point of manufacturing for the presence of broken\nneedles using an in-line metal detector. Every roll accepted at the site must\nbe labeled with the manufacturer's name, including geotextile style and type, lot and roll numbers, and roll dimensions (length, width, and gross weight). The geocushion material must be demonstrated to be chemically compatible with\nwaste and leachate with which it will come in contact. (b) Construction requirements. (1)\n\nDuring placement, stones, excessive dirt, or moisture must not be entrapped either within or beneath the geocushion\nmaterials. (2)\n\nThe geocushion\nmaterials must be placed with minimal wrinkles or folds. (3)\n\nGeocushion materials must be connected or\nseamed together using methods approved by the department. (4)\n\nAll rolls of geocushion materials\nreceived and stored at the landfill must be enclosed in protective wrapping\nsuch as the original, unopened packaging or an opaque, waterproof tarpaulin to\nensure protection from direct sunlight, ultraviolet radiation, precipitation, flames or welding sparks, temperatures in excess of 160° F and below\n32° F, mud, debris and other deleterious materials, and any other\nenvironmental condition that may damage the physical property values of the\nmaterial. The storage location must be stable, dry, and well-drained. The\nsurface on which the material is stored must be free of sharp objects. Rolls of\ngeocushion materials must not be stored in stacks more than three tiers high. Extended outdoor storage of rolls must not exceed manufacturer's\nrecommendations or nine months, whichever is less. For storage periods longer\nthan manufacturer's recommendations or nine months, geocushion rolls must be\nstored off the ground under an additional cover or tarpaulin beyond the\nmanufacturer's wrapping or placed in an enclosed structure. (c) Certification requirements. The project engineer must provide: (1)\ncertification that all geocushion materials placed on the site have been\ninspected by the manufacturer and at the job site for needles and sheet\ndefects; (2)\nverification that the\nphysical and mechanical properties of the designed geocushion material were\nsupplied and installed per the project specifications; and\n(3)\ncertification that applicable\ngeosynthetic quality control testing was performed in accordance with the\nrequirements of section\n363-6.8\n(c)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart for any geocushion materials.
