  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 4.2 - Savings bank not permitted to remove trustee automatically upon his separation from his position as an officer\n\nState Regulations\nA savings bank was advised that a proposed by-law providing\nfor automatic removal of a trustee who is also an officer, upon separation of\nthe trustee from the office he holds, would be inconsistent with section 248, and, therefore invalid. In limine, the department noted that section\n248(2) sets forth the instances when it is mandatory that the office of a\ntrustee becomes vacant; that section 248(1) sets forth the circumstances under\nwhich a trustee may be removed at the discretion of the other trustees; and\nthat there is no provision in either of those subdivisions or any other part of\nthe Banking Law for removal of a trustee who is also an officer, upon his\nseparation from such office. The department reasoned that discretionary removal\nby the board of trustees is limited to the conditions described in subdivision\n1 of section 248. The department observed that besides providing the\nsubstantive grounds for discretionary removal, the subdivision also set forth\nprocedural requirements which must be satisfied. The department rejected the\nidea that these procedural safeguards could apply to situations other than\nthose set forth in the subdivision, and did not believe that it would make\nsense to apply less stringent standards to non-statutorily prescribed grounds\nfor removal. Under the circumstances, it was clear to the department that the\n\nLegislature did not contemplate discretionary removal of trustees for other\nthan the statutorily prescribed grounds. Considering that officers are appointed or elected by the\nboard of trustees and may be removed, with or without cause, by the trustees, the department concluded that a trustee who is an officer would not be able to\nfunction as a trustee with total independence from the influence of the other\nmembers of the board, so long as he must act with the knowledge that his\ncolleagues on the board might remove him as trustee by terminating his\nemployment as an officer of the savings bank. The department emphasized that its policy is to prevent a\nsituation where certain members of a board may exercise undue or excessive\ninfluence upon other members of the board. Just as the influence of\nofficer-trustees is restrained by the limitation of their number on the board, so too should the influence which other members of the board might exercise\nupon an officer-trustee be restrained. Lastly, it was recognized that certain officers may be\nelected to the board of trustees so that their special knowledge will be\nreadily available to the board and that when such officer-trustees no longer\nserve as officers their value to the board would, understandably, be\ndiminished. Nevertheless, the department concluded that the potential danger of\nthe proposed by-law required its prohibition. DATED: September 3, 1968\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
