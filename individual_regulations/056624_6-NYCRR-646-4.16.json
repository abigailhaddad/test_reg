Tit. 6 §§ 646-4.16 - General requirements for stormwater management plans\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach municipality's stormwater management plan shall, at\na minimum: (a) Provide for the\nimplementation of the plan and its integration with other components of the\nmunicipality's land use planning program, such as zoning, subdivision, sanitary\nand site plan review controls, provide for the coordination of stormwater\nmanagement with adjoining communities, and provide for public participation in\nstormwater planning and decisionmaking. (b) Establish objectives and set policies\nwhich ensure that pollutant loads in stormwater runoff are minimized, that\nstormwater runoff is recharged to groundwater to the maximum extent possible, and that increases in the annual volume of stormwater runoff entering Lake\n\nGeorge as a result of any land use or development are prevented. The objectives\nand policies shall also apply to new, expanded or altered development, land\nclearing, land grading and erosion and sedimentation control measures. Said\npolicies and objectives shall address land use practices such as the use of\npesticides and other chemicals, fertilizers, road salt, sand and other possible\ncontaminants in maintaining or managing new or existing land resources, roads\nand structures, and shall establish policies and objectives for stormwater\nmanagement for projects undertaken by state and local government bodies, and\nremediating the effects of stormwater runoff from presently existing private\nfacilities and government facilities including highways, parking lots and\nbuildings. (c) Assign\nresponsibility for stormwater management planning and regulation to one or more\nelected or appointed local boards, which may be a board appointed specifically\nfor that purpose, or to qualified staff persons. Municipal authority to make\nstormwater-related decisions may be delegated to such a designated board or to\nsuch staff, provided the scope and limits of authority are clearly specified. The staff position or type of retained consultant who will advise the\nadministering board shall be described, together with the qualifications which\nshall be required for such position. Duly qualified engineering and project\nreview personnel or consultants shall be required for reviewing development\nproject plans, programs, reports and construction. (d) Establish procedures for periodically\nrevising stormwater management plans and stormwater regulatory programs and\noverseeing implementation, as an on-going process, including administration of\nregulatory controls and execution of nonregulatory methods for accomplishing\nplan objectives. (e) Outline and\nsummarize the stormwater regulatory program to be adopted consistent with the\nrequirements of this Subpart. (f) Develop and implement procedures for ensuring that private and municipal\nstormwater control structures and natural or human-made features used to\ncontrol stormwater runoff are properly and periodically maintained, and are\nreplaced in timely fashion as may become necessary. The procedures must provide\nfor adequate funding and administrative control in perpetuity. (g) Consider, in determining the significance\nof stormwater impacts on the lake, past degradation of the lake's water\nquality, the cumulative impact of proposed projects and any other development\nor activities in the park which can be reasonably anticipated and the\nassimilative capacity of the lake. (h) Provide for the application of the plan\nto projects undertaken or constructed by the municipality. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
