  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-2.5 - Interest income and net gains from loans. State Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A(5)(a)(2)(A))\n(a) (1)\nA\nloan secured by real property means that real property constitutes 50% or more\nof the aggregate value of the collateral used to secure a loan, when valued at\nfair market value (FMV), as of the time the loan is originated. (2)\n\nInterest income from loans secured by\nreal property located within New York State shall be included in New York\nreceipts. If one or more of the properties that secure the loan are located\noutside of New York, the amount of interest income from such loan included in\n\nNew York receipts is the product of such interest income and a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the FMV of real property located in New York State used\nto secure the loan and the denominator of which is the FMV of all real property\nused to secure the loan. All interest income from loans secured by real\nproperty shall be included in everywhere receipts. (3)\n(i) The\namount of net gains (not less than zero) from sales of loans secured by real\nproperty included in New York receipts is the product of net gains from all\nloans secured by real property and a fraction, the numerator of which is gross\nproceeds from sales of loans secured by real property located within New York\n\nState and the denominator of which is gross proceeds from sales of loans\nsecured by real property located within and without New York State. Net gains\n(not less than zero) from all loans secured by real property computed in\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph shall be included in everywhere\nreceipts. (ii)\n\nFor each sale of a\nloan secured by real property, the corporation shall compute a gain or loss\nfrom the sale by subtracting the carrying cost of the loan from the sale price\nof the loan. If the sale price exceeds the carrying cost, the result is a gain. If the sale price is less than the carrying cost, the result is a\nloss. (iii)\n\nTo determine the amount\nof net gains from sales of loans secured by real property, the corporation\nshall subtract the sum of all losses computed in subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph from the sum of all gains computed in subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph. If the result is equal to or less than zero, no amount is included\nin New York receipts and everywhere receipts. (iv)\n\nGross proceeds shall be determined after\nthe deduction of transactional costs incurred to acquire the loan, but shall\nnot be less than zero. The transactional costs incurred to acquire the loan\nshall not include the carrying cost of the loan. (v) If one or more of the properties that\nsecure the loan are located outside of New York, the amount of gross proceeds\nfrom loans secured by real property within New York State is the product of all\nsuch gross proceeds and a fraction, the numerator of which is the FMV of real\nproperty located in New York State used to secure the loan and the denominator\nof which is the FMV of all real property used to secure the loan. (b) (1)\nA loan not secured by real property means\nthat less than 50% of the aggregate value of the collateral used to secure a\nloan, when valued at FMV as of the time the loan is originated, is real\nproperty. (2)\n\nInterest income from\nloans not secured by real property is included in New York receipts if\nborrower's location as of the time the loan is originated is in New York State. All interest income from loans not secured by real property is included in\neverywhere receipts. If the borrower is an individual, the borrower's location\nis the borrower's billing address in the records of the lender. If the borrower\nis a business entity, the borrower's location is the borrower's commercial\ndomicile. (3)\n(i) The amount of net gains (not less than\nzero) from sales of loans not secured by real property included in New York\nreceipts is the product of net gains from all loans not secured by real\nproperty and a fraction, the numerator of which is gross proceeds from sales of\nloans not secured by real property to purchasers located within New York State\nand the denominator of which is gross proceeds from sales of loans not secured\nby real property to purchasers located within and without New York State. Net\ngains (not less than zero) from the sale of loans not secured by real property\ncomputed in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph shall be included in\neverywhere receipts. (ii)\n\nFor each\nsale of a loan not secured by real property, the corporation shall compute a\ngain or loss from the sale by subtracting the carrying cost of the loan from\nthe sale price of the loan. If the sale price exceeds the carrying cost, the\nresult is a gain. If the sale price is less than the carrying cost, the result\nis a loss. (iii)\n\nTo determine the\namount of net gains from sales of all loans not secured by real property, the\ncorporation shall subtract the sum of all losses computed in subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph from the sum of all gains computed in subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph. If the result is equal to or less than zero, no amount shall be\nincluded in New York receipts and everywhere receipts. (iv)\n\nGross proceeds shall be determined after\nthe deduction of transactional costs incurred to acquire the loan, but shall\nnot be less than zero. The transactional costs incurred to acquire the loan\nshall not include the carrying cost of the loan. (c) The determinations of the type\nof loan, FMV of real property, and borrower's location are made at the time the\nloan is originated, and will be redetermined only if the loan is\nrefinanced. (d) For purposes of\nthis section, the term carrying costs means the expenses associated with\nholding the loan. (d) Examples. Example 1: Corporation X has interest income from loans\nsecured by real property of $5,000, broken down as follows: * $2,500 from Loan N secured by real property located in\n\nNew York; * $1,500 from Loan O secured by real property located\noutside of New York; and\n* $1,000 from Loan P secured by property located in New\n\nYork and another state. The $2,500 of interest income from Loan N is included in\n\nNew York receipts because the property used to secure the loan is located\nwithin New York State. The $1,500 of interest income from Loan O is not\nincluded in New York receipts because the property used to secure the loan is\nnot in New York State. Because the property used to secure Loan P is located\nwithin and without New York State, Corporation X must determine the FMV of the\nproperties at the time the loan was originated when determining the portion of\nsuch interest income to include in New York receipts. At the time the loan was originated, the FMV of the New\n\nYork property was $200,000 and the FMV of the property located outside of New\n\nYork was $300,000. Therefore, Corporation X includes $400 ($200,000/$500,000 x\n$1,000) of the interest income from loan P in New York receipts. Corporation X includes $2,900 of interest income from\nloans secured by real property in New York receipts and $5,000 interest income\nfrom loans secured by real property in everywhere receipts. Example 2: Corporation Y's sale of Loans N and O, secured by real property within and without New York State, during the taxable\nyear are broken down as follows: * Loan N, secured only by real property in New York, was\nsold for $300,000. After deducting its carrying cost of the loan from the sale\nprice, Corporation Y computes a loss of $1,000 from Loan N; and\n* Loan O, secured by real property in New York and\nanother state, was sold for $200,000. After deducting its carrying cost of the\nloan from the sale price, Corporation Y computes a gain of $1,500 from Loan\nO. Corporation Y has net gains from loans secured by real\nproperty of $500, because the $1,000 loss from Loan N offsets the $1,500 gain\nfrom Loan O. To determine the amount of net gains from loans secured\nby real property to include in New York receipts, Corporation Y must determine\nthe gross proceeds from sales of loans secured by real property in New York and\ntotal gross proceeds from loans secured by real property within and without New\n\nYork State. As the property used to secure Loan O is located within\nand without New York State, Corporation Y first determines that the FMV at the\ntime the loan was originated of the New York property was $200,000 and the\nproperty located outside of New York was $300,000. Therefore, the New York\nproperty is 40% ($200,000/$500,000) of the total FMV of all the properties used\nto secure Loan O. The gross proceeds from loans secured by real property\n\nNew York State of $380,000 is the sum of $300,000 from loan N and $80,000 from\n\nLoan O ($200,000 gross proceeds x 40 percent). The total gross proceeds of\nloans secured by real property located within and without New York State is\n$500,000. Corporation Y's gross proceeds fraction of $380,000/$500,000 (or 76\npercent) is used to determine the portion of net gains from loans secured by\nreal property in New York. Corporation Y includes $380 of net gains from loans\nsecured by real property in New York receipts (76% x $500). $500 of net gains\nfrom loans secured by real property is included in everywhere receipts. Example 3: Taxpayer D makes multiple loans not secured\nby real property to Corporation E, domiciled in State X. Each loan is executed\nby a separate division of Corporation E and the divisions are located in State\nY, State Z, and New York State. The interest income earned by Taxpayer D on\nthese loans is not included in New York receipts because Corporation E's\ncommercial domicile is State X. All such interest income is included in\neverywhere receipts. Example 4: Taxpayer E earns interest income from a loan\nnot secured by real property that it made to Corporation F, domiciled in New\n\nYork at the time the loan is originated. The interest income is included in New\n\nYork receipts because Corporation F's commercial domicile is New York State. Five years after the loan is originated, the commercial domicile of Corporation\nF changes from New York State to State X. The interest income continues to be\nincluded in New York receipts because Corporation F's commercial domicile at\nthe time the loan was originated was New York State. All such interest income\nis included in everywhere receipts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
