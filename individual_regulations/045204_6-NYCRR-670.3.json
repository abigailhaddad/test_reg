  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 670.3 - Operation of the shandaken tunnel\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe city shall utilize the Shandaken tunnel only in\naccordance with the provisions of this section. (a) During all times of the year, the city\nshall divert through the Shandaken tunnel those quantities of water, as\ndetermined at the tunnel intake chamber, that when added to the flow of Esopus\n\nCreek, as measured at the Shandaken gaging station, are necessary and\nsufficient to provide at all times a combined flow of at least 160 million\ngallons per day--mgd (248 cubic feet per second-- cfs); provided, when the\n\nSchoharie reservoir is physically incapable of providing sufficient water to\nmaintain such combined minimum flow, the city shall make the maximum diversions\nof water into the Shandaken tunnel which the Schoharie reservoir is physically\ncapable of providing. The provisions of this subdivision shall not be\napplicable when water is spilling from the Ashokan reservoir. (b) Between June 1st and October 31st, inclusively, the city shall not make any diversion of water through the\n\nShandaken tunnel: (1)\nwhenever the flow of\n\nEsopus Creek, as measured at the Shandaken gaging station, exceeds 300 mgd (465\ncfs); or\n(2)\nwhenever the amount of\nthat diversion, as determined at the intake chamber of the Shandaken tunnel, added to the flow of Esopus Creek, as measured at the Shandaken gaging station, will produce a comnbined flow exceeding 300 mgd (465 cfs). Provided, in order to minimize spill from Schoharie\nreservoir, the city may make such diversions when the unfilled storage capacity\nof Schoharie reservoir is less than five billion gallons and the unfilled\nstorage capacity of Ashokan reservoir is more than five billion gallons. (c) During all times of\na year, the city shall, in making any diversions into the Shandaken tunnel, open the Shandaken tunnel at intervals of one hour or more in increments not\nexceeding 40 mgd (62 cfs), and shall close the Shandaken tunnel at intervals of\none hour or more in increments not exceeding 20 mgd (31 cfs). Provided, the\nprovisions of this subdivision shall not be applicable from November 1st to May\n31st, inclusively, whenever the flow in Esopus Creek, as measured at the\n\nShandaken gaging station, exceeds 300 mgd (465 cfs). (d) From November 1st to May 31st, inclusively, whenever the flow in Esopus Creek, as measured at the Shandaken\ngaging station, exceeds 300 mgd (465 cfs), the city may, in making any\ndiversions into the Shandaken tunnel, make diversions of any amount or no\ndiversions as it determines proper and may open and close the Shandaken tunnel\nat such rates as it determines proper. (e) Prior to its commencement of any action\nrelating to the operation of the Shandaken tunnel that is consistent with the\nprovisions of subdivisions (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the city\nshall notify the office of the department's regional director at New Paltz, New\n\nYork. The city shall not be required to obtain any specific review or approval\nby the department for any action which is consistent with the provisions of\nsubdivisions (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section. (f) (1)\n\nDue\nto the technical limitations of operating water regulating devices and\nmeasuring flows, any rate of flow stated, required or allowed pursuant to this\n\nPart relating to the Shandaken gaging station or the Shandaken tunnel intake\nchamber or to the opening or closing of the Shandaken tunnel shall be deemed to\ninclude a rate of flow ten percent higher than the stated, required or allowed\nrate of flow where that rate is a maximum allowable rate and shall be deemed to\ninclude a rate of flow ten percent lower than the stated, required or allowed\nrate of flow where that rate of flow is a minimum allowable rate. (2)\n\nThe provisions of this Part shall be\ninterpreted as reflecting the time lapses required by subdivision (c) of this\nsection and the time required for water to pass through the Shandaken\ntunnel. (3)\n\nThe provisions of this\n\nPart shall not be deemed to require the city to monitor the flow in Esopus\ncreek, as measured at the Shandaken gaging station, more than once during any\ntwenty-four hour period or, accordingly, to adjust diversions of water into the\n\nShandaken tunnel more than once during any twenty-four hour period; provided, the city shall so monitor such flow and make any necessary corresponding\nadjustment at least once during every twenty-four hour period and further\nprovided, any such monitoring of the flow in Esopus creek shall be binding on\nthe city with respect to compliance with the provisions of this Part until the\nnext such monitoring is made. (4)\n\nThe provisions of this Part shall not be interpreted as requiring any\nadjustment of flow in the Shandaken tunnel, in response to a hydrologic event\nof short duration which may cause the flow maximums established by subdivision\n(b) of this section to be exceeded for a short duration (e.g., a summer rain\nstorm of three hours). (g) The city may take an action with regard\nto the operation of the Shandaken tunnel which does not meet the requirements\nstated in subdivisions (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section provided it\nobtains the department's approval of such action, prior to the commencement of\nany such action, in accordance with this subdivision. The department may\napprove an action proposed pursuant to this subdivision where it finds such\naction is reasonable and consistent with the purposes of this Part. (1)\n\nThe city reservoir releases manager shall\nsubmit via certified mail a written proposal for such action to the department\nreservoir releases manager. Such proposal shall specify the dates and times of\nthe proposed action, the amount of water to be diverted, the rate at which\nwater is to be diverted, the duration of the action, and the purpose of the\naction. Such written proposal shall be received in the office of the department\nreservoir releases manager not less than 24 hours prior to the commencement of\nthe first proposed action. (2)\n\nWithin 24 hours of his or her receipt of the written proposal by the city\nreservoir releases manager, or as soon thereafter as practical, the department\nreservoir releases manager shall notify the city reservoir releases manager by\ntelephone whether the department has approved, approved with modifications or\ndisapproved the proposed action; and in the event of an approval or approval\nwith modifications he or she shall specify the dates and times of the\nauthorized action, the amount of water to be diverted, the rate at which water\nis to be diverted, the duration of the action, and any conditions pertaining to\nthe implementation or termination of the approved action. Provided, between the\nreceipt of the city's written proposal and the department's telephone\ntransmission of its decision, the city and the department may negotiate by\ntelephone relative to such proposal. (3)\n\nAs soon as practicable after notifying\nthe city reservoir releases manager by telephone as provided in paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision, the department reservoir releases manager shall send a\ncertified mail letter to the city reservoir releases manager stating the\ndecision of the department with regard to the proposal involved. In the event\nthe department has approved the city's proposal or approved it with\nmodifications, said letter shall specify the dates and times of the authorized\naction, the amount of water to be diverted, the rate at which water is to be\ndiverted, the duration of the action, and any conditions pertaining to the\nimplementation or termination of the approved action. In the event the\ndepartment has disapproved the city's proposal or approved it with\nmodifications, said letter shall specify the reasons for such disapproval or\nmodifications. (4)\n\nWhen the city is\nnot able to provide a written proposal to the department as specified in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision at least 24 hours prior to the commencement\nof the first proposed action, the city reservoir releases manager shall submit\na proposal for such an action by telephone to the department reservoir releases\nmanager, which telephone request shall be made not less than 24 hours prior to\nthe first proposed action. Such proposal shall specify all the information\nrequired for a written proposal under paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Immediately following such telephone proposal, the city reservoir releases\nmanager shall send to the department reservoir releases manager via certified\nmail a written proposal stating those matters covered by the telephone\nproposal. Within 24 hours of his or her receipt of such a proposal by\ntelephone, or as soon as practical thereafter, the department reservoir\nreleases manager shall notify the city reservoir releases manager as to the\ndepartment's decision regarding such proposal in the manner specified in\nparagraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision. Provided, between the receipt of\nthe city's telephone proposal and the department's telephone transmission of\nits decision pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the city and the\ndepartment may negotiate by telephone relative to such proposal. (5)\n\nThe telephone approval by the department\nprovided in paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subdivision shall constitute the\nauthorization for the city to proceed with an action approved by the department\npursuant to this subdivision. No action shall be taken by the city pursuant to\nthis subdivision until such telephone approval has been received, and any such\naction shall be undertaken in accordance with such telephone\napproval. (6)\n\nThe city reservoir\nreleases manager and the department reservoir releases manager shall each\nmaintain a complete and accurate log of all telephone conversations made\npursuant to paragraphs (2) and (4) of this subdivision. (7)\n\nThe city reservoir releases manager and\ndepartment reservoir releases manager shall provide the necessary telephone\narrangements to fulfill the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (4) of this\nsubdivision. (8)\n\nWith respect to\nany action proposed by the city pursuant to this section which relates to any\ninspection, maintenance or repair to the Schoharie reservoir, the Ashokan\nreservoir or the Shandaken tunnel or any appurtenant structures or facilities, the approval, approval with modifications or disapproval of the department\nunder this section shall be made with respect to the time and duration of the\nproposed action and shall not be made with respect to the substantive details\nof the inspection, repair or maintenance activity. The department shall not\nunreasonably delay or hinder any inspection, maintenance or repair activity\nwhich the city wishes to undertake with regard to said facilities. (h) Both the city reservoir\nreleases manager and the department reservoir releases manager may specify one\nor more persons on their respective staffs to take all actions under this\nsection in the place of and on behalf of such manager when such manager is not\nable to take such action directly. Provided, each such designation shall be in\nwriting and shall be on file in the respective office of each manager. Provided\nfurther, any such designation shall authorize such designee to act in all\nrespects under this section for the respective manager. (i) The department may request the city to\ntake an action with respect to the diversion of water from the Schoharie\nreservoir through the Shandaken tunnel in a manner that does or does not comply\nwith the provisions of any or all of subdivisions (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this\nsection for the purpose of field monitoring or testing, research, protecting\nthe fishery or other natural resources of Esopus creek, protecting the fishery\nor other natural resources of Schoharie reservoir or Ashokan reservoir for the\nbenefit of existing recreational uses of such reservoirs, or special\nrecreational events on Esopus Creek. Such request by the department shall be\nsent by certified mail from the department reservoir releases manager to the\ncity reservoir releases manager and shall be received by the city reservoir\nreleases manager at least 24 hours prior to the first requested action. Said\nrequest by the department shall be consistent with the purposes of this Part\nand shall specify the dates and times of the requested action, the amount of\nwater to be diverted, the rate at which water is to be diverted, the duration\nof the requested action, the specific purpose of the requested action and any\nconditions governing implementation and termination of the requested action. If\nthe requested action will not occur when the Schoharie or Ashokan reservoir is\nspilling and will not cause either of such reservoirs to spill water or to\nspill increased amounts of water, the city shall comply with such request; and\nin the event such requested action will occur when either reservoir is spilling\nor will cause either reservoir to spill or to spill increased amounts of water, the city shall determine whether or not to comply with such request. The city's\nreceipt of the department's letter containing such request shall constitute\nauthorization for the city to increase or decrease the flow of water in the\n\nShandaken tunnel in accordance with such letter. (j) All telephone logs and written\ncommunications made pursuant to this section shall be considered matters of\npublic record. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
