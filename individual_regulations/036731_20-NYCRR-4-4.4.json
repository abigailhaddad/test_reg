  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-4.4 - General rule for determining where the benefit is received\n\nState Regulations\n\nUnless the corporation meets the specific criteria and\nhas sufficient information necessary to apply the special rules in section\n4-4.3\nof this Subpart, determining\nwhere the benefit is received depends on whether the customer is an individual\ncustomer, a business customer or a passive investment customer. (a) Individual customer. In the case where\nthe corporation's customer is an individual, the benefit of the service or\nother business activity is presumed to be received at the customer's billing\naddress. If the corporation does not have the customer's billing address, it\nmust use reasonable approximation. (b) Business customer. (1)\n\nExcept in instances where the business\naddress presumption applies, the benefit of the service or other business\nactivity is presumed to be received in New York, without regard to the billing\naddress of the corporation's customer, if the customer receives the benefit of\nthe service or other business activity in New York. (2)\n\nThe benefit can be received at the\nlocation of a third party (e.g., the consumer) only in the case of an\nintermediary transaction. A third party does not include the customer's\nemployees, agents, officers, partners (in the case of a partnership), managing\nmembers (in the case of a limited liability company), or shareholders (in the\ncase of a New York S corporation). (3)\n\nBenefit received both within and without\n\nNew York State. Where the customer receives the benefit in New York and at\nleast one other location, the corporation should apportion the receipts based\non the percentage of value derived by the customer in each location where\nbenefit is received. (c) Passive investment customer. (1)\n\nReceipts for\nmanagement, distribution, and administration services provided to a passive\ninvestment customer are apportioned under the rules provided for in this\nsubdivision unless a special rule for determining where the benefit is received\nis applicable. Such receipts include amounts received directly from a passive\ninvestment customer as well as amounts received from the investors in such\npassive investment customer, in their capacity as such. (2)\n(i) The\nbenefit of management, distribution, and administration services provided to a\npassive investment customer is presumed to be received at the location of the\ninvestors in such passive investment customer unless the investor is holding\nthe interest in the passive investment customer for a beneficial owner. If the\ninvestor is holding the interest in the passive investment customer for a\nbeneficial owner, the benefit of such services is presumed to be received at\nthe location of the beneficial owner. (ii)\n\nThe location of an individual investor\nor beneficial owner is its billing address. The location of an investor or\nbeneficial owner that is not an individual is the investor's or beneficial\nowner's principal place of business. Provided, if the corporation does not know\nthe principal place of business, the location is the investor or beneficial\nowner's billing address. (iii)\n\nManagement, distribution and administration services provided to a passive\ninvestment customer are apportioned to this state in proportion to the average\nvalue of the interests in the passive investment customer held by the passive\ninvestment customer's investors and beneficial owners located in this state. To\ncalculate the average value of the interests in the passive investment\ncustomer, add the percentage of the value of the interests held by investors\nand beneficial owners located in this state at the beginning of the taxable\nyear to the percentage of the value of the interests held by investors and\nbeneficial owners located in this state at the end of the taxable year, and\ndivide by two. (3)\n\nIf\nthe corporation cannot determine the location in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, the benefit of management, distribution, and administration\nservices provided to a passive investment customer is presumed to be received\nat the location where the contract for such services is managed by the passive\ninvestment customer. (4)\n\nFor\npurposes of this subdivision, the following terms shall have the following\nmeaning: (i) \"Administration services\"\nincludes clerical, accounting, bookkeeping, data processing, internal auditing, legal and tax services performed for a passive investment customer, but only if\nthe provider of such service or services during the taxable year in which such\nservice or services are sold also sells management or distribution services, as\ndefined in this paragraph, to such passive investment customer. (ii)\n\"Beneficial owners\" means any person who\nmade an independent decision to invest. For purposes of this definition, \"independent decision to invest\" means a decision to invest made by a person\nwho was not required or committed to do so by contract, agreement, or any other\narrangement, understanding, or relationship except pursuant to law. The\nfollowing are not beneficial owners for purposes of this definition: (a) Master funds, feeder funds, and similar\nentities that pool investors\" assets. Master fund entities and feeder fund\nentities do not make independent decisions to invest because they are required\nby agreement with their limited partners, feeder funds, or other investors to\ninvest. (b) A shareholder of a\npublicly-traded corporation whose board decides to invest the corporation's\nexcess capital into an investment vehicle. The corporation, not the\nshareholder, makes the independent decision to invest in an investment\nvehicle. (c) A participant in a\ndefined benefit plan. Because participants have no control over whether to\ninvest in the defined benefit plan they are not beneficial owners. (iii)\n\"Distribution services\"\nmeans the services of advertising, servicing investor accounts (including\nredemptions), and marketing or selling interests in a passive investment\ncustomer. (iv)\n\"Management\nservices\" means the rendering of investment advice to a passive investment\ncustomer, making determinations as to when sales and purchases of securities\nare to be made on behalf of a passive investment company, or the selling or\npurchasing of securities constituting assets of a passive investment customer, and related activities, but only where such activity or activities are\nperformed pursuant to a contract with the passive investment\ncustomer.
