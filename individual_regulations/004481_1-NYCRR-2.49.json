(b) All pasteurized milk\nand milk products, except those to be cultured, are cooled immediately in\napproved equipment prior to filling and packaging to a temperature of 45° F (7°\nC) or less. All pasteurized milk and milk products shall be stored at a\ntemperature of 45° F (7° C) or less. (c) Each freezer and cold storage compartment\nused to store and hold food capable of supporting growth of microorganisms must\nbe fitted with an indicating thermometer, temperature-measuring device, or\ntemperature-recording device that complies with the applicable specifications\nof Appendix 3 of this Title and shall be installed as to show the temperature\naccurately within the compartment. Such thermometer shall be located in the\nwarmest zone of the freezer and cold storage compartment. Each storage tank\nshall be equipped with an indicating thermometer, the sensor of which shall be\nlocated to permit the registering of the temperature of the contents when the\ntank contains no more than 20 percent of its calibrated capacity. Such\nthermometer shall comply with the applicable specifications of Appendix 3 of\nthis Title and shall be installed as to show the temperature accurately within\nthe compartment. (d) All surface\ncoolers comply with the following specifications: (1)\n\nThe sections of open-surface coolers\nshall be so installed as to leave a gap of at least 0.25 inch between the\nheader sections to permit easy cleaning. (2)\n\nWhere header ends are not completely\nenclosed within the cooler covers, condensation or leakage from the headers\nshall be prevented from entering the milk or milk products by so shaping the\nexposed header faces, above and below all gaps, that condensation is directed\naway from the tubes, and by using deflectors at the bottom of the headers, or\nby shortening the bottom through, or by some other approved method. (3)\n\nThe location of supports of cooler\nsections shall prevent drip from entering the milk or milk products. (4)\n\nAll open-surface coolers shall be\nprovided with tight-fitting shields which protect the milk and milk products\nfrom contamination by flies, dust, drip, splash or manual contact. (e) Recirculated cold water which\nis used in coolers and exchangers, including those systems in which a freezing\npoint depressant is used, is from a safe source and protected from\ncontamination. Such water shall be tested semiannually and shall comply with\nthe bacteriological standards. Recirculated water systems which become\ncontaminated through repair work or otherwise shall be properly treated and\ntested before being returned to use. Freezing point depressants, when used in\nrecirculating systems, shall be nontoxic. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
