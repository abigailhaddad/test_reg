A resident may\napply for a temporary release program by filling out the Application to\n\nTemporary Release Committee form, indicating the type of temporary release for\nwhich he wishes to apply and his reasons for applying. (b) Preliminary review for eligibility. Upon\nreceiving an Application to Temporary Release Committee form, the interviewer\nshall review the resident's file to determine whether the resident is eligible\nto participate in the temporary release program, using the criteria set out in\nsection\n179-3.6\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart. All subsequent steps shall be recorded on the appropriate\nforms. (c) Review for suitability. The interviewer also shall evaluate the applicant for suitability, using the\ncriteria set out in section\n179-3.6\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. The interviewer shall indicate the results of his evaluation on the\n\nApplication Evaluation form. The interviewer shall preliminarily screen for\noffenses involving the use or threatened use of a weapon, infliction of a\nserious physical injury upon another, or a sexual offense involving forcible\ncompulsion. Serious physical injury means physical injury which creates a\nsubstantial risk of death, or which causes death or serious and protracted\ndisfigurement, protracted impairment of health or protracted loss or impairment\nof the function of any bodily organ. If the applicant has committed one or more\nof these offenses, the interviewer shall indicate such by checking the\nstatutory review box on the Application Evaluation form for the special\nattention of the director of temporary release programs and the director of the\ndivision. (d) Notice to resident. The interviewer shall notify the resident, via the Notification to Resident\nform, of the results of the preliminary review. If the resident is ineligible\nto participate in the temporary release program, he for ineligibility include, but are not limited to: statutory ineligibility, outstanding warrants, a\nserious disciplinary action, escape or absconding, attempted escape or\nabsconding, or improper temporary release purpose. If the resident is eligible\nto participate in the temporary release program, he shall be notified of the\ntime of his interview. (e) Interviewer meets with resident. After evaluating the application for\nsuitability, the interviewer shall meet with the resident to explain the\nevaluation process and the preliminary results. Any dispute about information\nused in evaluating the application shall be noted by the interviewer. If there\nis no indication in the files that the information is inaccurate, the resident\nshould be asked to provide some evidence that the information in the file is\nwrong. However, if it appears that the information in the file may be incorrect\nand it also appears that the resident might have some difficulty in obtaining\nthe correct information, the interviewer should attempt to verify the\ninformation. (f) Schedule resident\nmeeting with temporary release committee. If the applicant is eligible to\nparticipate in the temporary release program, an interview for the resident\nwith the temporary release committee will be scheduled. The chairperson shall\nnotify the resident of the meeting via the Notification to Resident form. Copies of the notification shall be provided to all appropriate\nparties. (g) Appearance before the\ntemporary release committee and notice of decision. (1)\n\nReview of the resident's facility file. When examining the file, the committee shall carefully review the placing\noffense(s). In the case of a crime of violence, attention should be paid to the\nresident's participation in the crime, whether serious physical injury\nresulted, and any use of a weapon. (2)\n\nTemporary release committee\nrecommendation. After meeting with the resident, the temporary release\ncommittee will either recommend approval of or disapprove the application for\ntemporary release. The committee's decision shall be made at a meeting of the\nfull committee. In making its decision, the committee should center its\nattention on the interview, documents in the facility record, Application\n\nEvaluation form and specific recommendations of staff. The committee shall also\ntake into account any other factors which it finds significant. (3)\n\nStandard for referral. In general, the\napplicant's ability to profit from participation in temporary release should be\nweighed against whatever risk his release would pose to the community or the\nprogram. A resident should be denied temporary release if his presence in the\ncommunity would pose an unwarranted threat to his own or public safety, or if\nthere is substantial evidence to indicate the resident cannot successfully\ncomplete his requested temporary release program. (4)\n\nDisapproval of the application. If the\ncommittee decides not to approve an application, the resident shall be so\nnotified and provided with a statement of the reasons. No further action shall\nbe taken regarding the application. Should the case warrant, the resident may\nbe advised not to reapply for the program requested because he is not suitable\nfor such a program. Disapproval of an application by the temporary release\ncommittee shall be appealable pursuant to section\n179-3.9\nof this Subpart. (5)\n\nApproval. (i) A decision to recommend approval of an\napplication must be approved by a majority vote of the committee. If the\ntemporary release committee recommends approval of a resident's application, the resident's temporary release file, including a memorandum setting forth the\nproposed temporary release program and, where appropriate, stipulating the\nextended bounds of confinement, shall be forwarded to the facility\ndirector. (ii)\n\nIf, at any stage in\nthe approval process, new or additional information becomes available\nconcerning the resident's eligibility or suitability, the temporary release\ncommittee chairperson shall review that information for its impact on the\ntemporary release committee's decision. If necessary, the temporary release\ncommittee shall be reconvened, the new information reviewed, the resident\ninterviewed, and an updated decision rendered. Such information and decision\nshall be incorporated into the resident's temporary release file. (h) Review by facility\ndirector. The facility director shall review the resident's temporary release\nfile and decide whether to endorse the resident's application. If the facility\ndirector does not endorse the application, he shall state his reason(s) in\nwriting and a copy of this statement shall be given to the resident and\nincluded in the resident's temporary release file. If the facility director\nendorses the application, he shall so indicate by signing the Central Office\n\nReferral Memorandum form. (i) Referral of an application to the director of temporary release programs for\nreview. All applications recommended for approval by the temporary release\ncommittee shall be forwarded to the director of temporary release programs in\n\nCentral Office for review, regardless of whether the facility director endorsed\nthe application. The resident's temporary release file, along with any other\npertinent information, including the facility director's statement if he does\nnot endorse the application, shall be sent to the director of temporary release\nprograms.
