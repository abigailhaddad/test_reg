  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 25.24 - Contingent permanent appointments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A permanent employee apointed or\npromoted to a position in a higher title, which is left temporarily vacant by\nthe leave of absence of the permanent incumbent, may, in the discretion of the\nappointing authority, be appointed or promoted with contingent permanent status\nin such position, provided that at the time of such appointment or promotion, such employee must have qualified by examination and either be eligible for\nnoncompetitive promotion to such higher-titled position or his or her name must\nbe among the three highest ranking eligibles on an existing list for such\nhigher-titled position who are willing to accept contingent permanent\nappointment or promotion to such position exclusive of eligibles already\nappointed or promoted to a similar position on a permanent basis or on a\ncontingent permanent basis. (b) An employee holding a position on a\ncontingent permanent basis shall have the following rights and be subject to\nthe following conditions: (1)\n\nUnless separated from service, such employee shall be deemed to be on leave of\nabsence from his or her lower-titled position until he or she either returns to\nsuch lower-titled position or gains full permanent status in his or her\nhigher-titled position or any higher-titled position. (2)\n\nSuch employee may, at his\nor her election and after reasonable notice, be restored to his or her\nlower-titled position at any time during such leave of absence, and shall be\nrestored to such position if required in accordance with other provisions of\nthis Part upon the return of the permanent incumbent to his or her or another\nsimilar higher-titled position. (3)\n\nHis or her contingent permanent\nstatus shall not adversely affect or impair eligibility for certification from\nthe eligible list for permanent appointment or promotion to such permanent\nvacancies as may occur in other similar positions. (4)\n\nHe or she shall be deemed\nto hold such position on a permanent basis for the purposes of section\n25.29\nof this Part, or under an\nagreement negotiated pursuant to article 14 of the Civil Service Law, and for\npurposes of section\n25.30\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (5)\n\nFor\npurposes of salary rights and benefits, he or she shall be deemed to hold such\nposition on a permanent basis. (6)\n\nFor purposes of subsequent\nexaminations, either open competitive or promotion, service in a position with\ncontingent permanent status shall be counted in the same manner as though it\nwere service on a permanent basis. If such employee received a contingent\npermanent appointment or promotion as a result of receiving additional credits\nin an examination as a veteran, he or she shall not be entitled to such credits\nin any subsequent examination for a higher-titled position for which he or she\nwould not otherwise be eligible without such contingent permanent\nstatus. (7)\n\nIn the\nevent that return from leave of one or more permanent incumbents or other\ncircumstances necessitates termination of the appointment or promotion of one\nor more incumbents not having permanent status, such termination shall be made\namong such incumbents in the unit for suspension or demotion designated\npursuant to section\n25.30\n(d) of this\n\nPart, wherein such return of permanent incumbents or other circumstances\noccurs. Incumbents having contingent permanent status shall have preference in\nretention in their positions or similar positions over temporary incumbents not\nhaving such status. If the return of permanent incumbents or other\ncircumstances necessitates termination of the appointment or promotion of\nincumbents having contingent permanent status, such termination shall be made\nin the inverse order of date of acquisition of contingent permanent\nstatus. (8)\n\nIf a\npermanent vacancy occurs in a position then held by an incumbent having\ncontingent permanent status therein, such vacancy shall be filled by selection\nby the appointing authority of one of such employees of the promotion unit\nhaving such contingent permanent status in such position or a similar position\n(whether or not he or she is then serving under contingent permanent\nappointment or promotion in such position); provided, however, that if any such\nemployee has acquired such contingent permanent status by appointment or\npromotion from an eligible list still in existence, he or she may not be\nselected for permanent appointment or promotion unless he or she is then\nreachable for permanent appointment or promotion from such eligible\nlist. (9)\n\nIf a\npermanent vacancy occurs in a position not then held by an incumbent having\ncontingent permanent status therein, such vacancy may be filled without regard\nto the provisions of this section; or if one or more employees in the promotion\nunit have contingent permanent status in the same title, the apponting\nauthority may, in his or her discretion, elect to fill such position in the\nmanner provided in paragraph (8) of this subdivision. (c) Nothing herein shall be\nconstrued to limit or adversely affect the right of eligibility for\nreinstatement of any person from a preferred list as provided in section\n25.31\nof this Part. (d) Notwithstanding the\nprovisions of subdivision (a) of this section, an employee may obtain\ncontingent permanent status upon appointment from an open competitive eligible\nlist, in accordance with section\n25.20\n(a) of this\n\nPart, to a position which is left temporarily vacant by the leave of absence of\nthe permanent incumbent. An employee obtaining contingent permanent status\npursuant to this subdivision shall have the rights and be subject to the\nconditions set forth in subdivision (b) of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
