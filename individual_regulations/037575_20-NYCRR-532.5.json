  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 532.5 - Direct payment permit\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. A direct payment permit is a notice to a vendor that the\nholder thereof is authorized to pay directly to the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance any tax due on purchases made. The vendor's responsibility for the\ncollection of tax from the permit holder is waived upon receipt of such\npermit. (b) Eligibility for a direct payment permit. In order to be eligible for a direct payment permit, a\npurchaser must meet the following conditions: (1)\nat the time tangible personal property or\nservices are acquired by a purchaser, it is impossible to determine the manner\nin which the property or services will be used; (2)\nthe purchaser must be registered as a\nvendor with the Processing Division, Sales Tax Section, and maintain a place of\nbusiness in New York State; and\n(3)\nthe purchaser must have timely filed all required returns and timely paid all\ntaxes due for the four quarterly periods immediately prior to the submission of\nan application for a direct payment permit. This condition may be modified in\nthe case of a new vendor who has not filed returns. (c) Applying for a direct payment\npermit. (1)\nA person seeking a direct\npayment permit must file a properly completed application directly with the\n\nDistrict Office Audit Bureau of the Division of Taxation, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. Applications may be obtained from the District Office Audit\n\nBureau. (2)\n\nThe applicant must\nsubmit the following information: (i) the\nbusiness name and address; (ii)\nthe\nvendor identification number; (iii)\na description of the business conducted; and\n(iv)\na statement clearly indicating the\napplicant's need for the permit and the types of transactions for which the\npermit will be used. (d) Authorization of permit. (1)\n\nThe department, upon review of the\napplication filed and the statement submitted, has the sole discretion to issue\na direct payment permit. (2)\n\nIf the\n\nDistrict Office Audit Bureau of the Audit Division approves the application, it\nwill authorize the use of a direct payment permit by the applicant by issuing a\nnumbered direct payment permit. (3)\n\nShould the District Office Audit Bureau disapprove or reject the application, it will notify the applicant by mail of such action. (4)\n\nUpon the termination or suspension of the\ndirect payment permit holder's business, or upon a change in the name or legal\nform of the business which requires a new registration, the permit shall be\nsurrendered to the District Office Audit Bureau. (e) Use of direct payment\npermits. (1)\nA direct payment permit\nmay only be used by the holder who makes purchases of tangible personal\nproperty or services, the use of which is unknown to him at the time of\npurchase. Example 1: A manufacturer-contractor purchases ingredients for use in\nthe production of concrete septic tanks. Some of the septic tanks will be sold\nwithout installation, while others are to be sold installed. Since the\nmanufacturer-contractor does not know the number of tanks that will be sold\ninstalled, he may use a direct payment permit when purchasing the\ningredients. (2)\nA direct\npayment permit may not be used: (i) as a\ndevice to defer payment of the sales tax on purchases; (ii)\nas a substitute for a resale certificate\nor other exemption certificates; or\n(iii)\nas a device to transfer the permit\nholder's privileges to another person. Example 2: The holder of a direct payment permit purchasing display\ncases for use in his showroom gives his supplier a copy of his direct payment\npermit to defer the payment of tax on his purchase which is taxable. This is a\nuse of the permit which is prohibited. Example 3: A holder of a direct payment permit engages a contractor to\nerect a warehouse and gives the contractor a copy of his direct payment permit. The contractor may not use the direct payment permit to defer his payment of\ntax on purchases which are for use by him in the erection of the warehouse. The\ncontractor's liability for the tax on his purchases is not relieved by his\ncustomer's direct payment permit. This is a use of the permit which is\nprohibited. (3)\n\nDirect payment permit holders are required to notify vendors, from whom they\nmake purchases, of their status by submitting a copy of the direct payment\npermit with the first purchase order. Each vendor accepting a direct payment\npermit must, for verification purposes, maintain a method of associating a sale\nfor which the permit was used, with the permit on file. (4)\nA direct payment permit holder, who by\nreason of misusing such permit, fails to pay any tax due when required, shall\nbe liable for penalty and interest in addition to the tax due and revocation of\nhis permit. See Part 536 of this Title for penalties and interest. (f) Reporting and payment of\ntax by a permit holder. (1)\n\nWhen a\ndirect payment permit holder uses property or services purchased under a direct\npayment permit, he is required to determine the taxable status of such use, and\nreport it on the return covering the period in which the use\noccurred. (2)\n\nThe records of a\nholder of a direct payment permit must show all purchases, the use made\nthereof, the location of use, and the tax due thereon was reported and paid. These records must be available to the Department of Taxation and Finance for\nexamination at any time upon demand. (3)\n\nEach year, at the time physical\ninventories are taken for federal income tax purposes, a reconciliation of\npurchases made under the direct payment permit shall be prepared and retained\nas part of the permit holder's files. Any inventory difference not accounted\nfor shall be included as additional purchases subject to use tax on the sales\nand use tax return for the reporting period in which the fiscal or calendar\nyear ended. (4)\n\nAny change in\nfederal income (either voluntary or by final federal adjustment), which results\nin a change in opening inventory, purchases, or closing inventory, shall be\nreported to the Division of Taxation within 90 days, together with an amended\nreturn for the applicable reporting period in which the inventory was\nreconciled. The amended return shall be filed with the Division of Taxation, District Office Audit Bureau, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. Any\npurchases or inventory which are unaccounted for shall be reported as\nadditional purchases subject to use tax on an amended return filed for the\nreporting period in which the fiscal or calendar year ended. (5)\n\nIf any change in inventory is a result of\na final federal adjustment, a copy of the federal adjustment shall be attached\nto the return required to be filed under paragraph (3) or (4) of this\nsubdivision. If the change was voluntary, substantiation for the change shall\nbe maintained. (6)\nA direct payment\npermit holder is required to comply with the reporting requirements for\ntransactions in which the permit was furnished. (i) A permit holder making purchases and\ntaking delivery of tangible personal property or services in an area having a\ntax rate which is higher than the tax rate in the area where the property or\nservices are used is liable for the payment of tax based on the higher rate. Example 1: A direct payment permit holder purchases and takes delivery\nof a forklift in County X (6% tax rate) for use in his plant located in County\nY (5% tax rate). He does not know whether its use will be taxable or exempt as\nproduction equipment. The purchaser issues a copy of his direct payment permit\nto the supplier at the time of purchase. If the fork lift is not used for an\nexempt purpose, the permit holder must report on his next sales tax return, the\namount of the transaction on the line for County X, under the heading\n\"Purchases Subject to Use Tax\" and remit the 6% tax based upon the point of\ndelivery. (ii)\nA permit\nholder, making purchases and taking delivery of tangible personal property or\nservices in an area having a tax rate which is less than the tax rate in the\narea where the property or services will be used, is liable for the payment of\ntax based upon the higher rate. Example 2: A direct payment permit holder, located in County A (6% tax\nrate), purchases a forklift with his permit from a supplier in County B (5% tax\nrate). He does not know whether its use will be taxable or exempt as production\nequipment. Delivery is taken within County B by the permit holder. On the next\nsales tax return if the forklift is not used for an exempt purpose, the permit\nholder must report the transaction as \"Purchases Subject to Use Tax\" on the\nline for County B and remit 5% tax. The transaction is also subject to an\nadditional compensating use tax of 1% for use of the forklift in County A. This\nadditional use tax must be shown in the space provided on the return for\nreporting transactions subject to local tax only. (iii)\nA permit holder operating in areas\nhaving differing tax rates, making purchases and taking delivery of tangible\npersonal property in bulk (as described in section 1119[a] of the Tax Law) is\nliable for the payment of tax based on the rate in effect in the area of use. Example 3: A direct payment permit holder has his main office in\n\nCounty L where only the statewide 4% tax rate is in effect and branch offices\nin County M (5% tax rate) and County N (6% tax rate). He purchases in bulk\nvarious office and merchandising supplies, such as invoice books, stationery, and catalogs for use in all his offices from a printer located in County L at a\ncost of $10,000. At the time of purchase, he does not know at which location\nany part of the supplies will be used. The supplies are delivered to the permit\nholder's main office and the printer is issued a copy of the direct payment\npermit. The permit holder stores the supplies at his warehouse in County L and\nperiodically distributes these supplies to his branch offices as needed. During\na reporting period the permit holder withdraws these supplies for use as\nfollows: Main Office\n$2,000\n\nCounty M Branch\n$1,000\n\nCounty N Branch\n$1,000\n\nOn his sales tax return for the period, the permit holder\nmust report as \"Purchases Subject to Use Tax\" the cost of the supplies and the\ntax due as follows: Purchases Subject to Use\n\nTax\n\nSales and Use\n\nTaxes\n\nNew York State 4%\n$2,000\n$80\n\nCounty M 5%\n$1,000\n$50\n\nCounty N 6%\n$1,000\n$60\n(7)\n\nDirect payment permit holders who make\nsales which are subject to sales tax, must report these transactions and pay\nthe appropriate taxes on the return filed for the period in which the sales\nwere made. (8)\n\nThe holder of a\ndirect payment permit is required to pay the tax due on his purchases, not\nacquired for resale or an exempt use, directly to the department with his sales\nand use tax return for the period in which the use of the purchases becomes\nknown. (g) Revocation. (1)\nA direct payment\npermit may be revoked for: (i) failure by the\nholder thereof to timely file his sales and use tax returns and timely pay any\ntax due; (ii)\nany misuse of the\nprivileges granted by the permit or failure to comply with any requirement with\nrespect to the permit; (iii)\na\nchange in business operations, so that it is possible to determine the use of\npurchases at the time made. (2)\nA notice of revocation sent by the\n\nDistrict Office Audit Bureau of the Audit Division by ordinary mail to the\nvendor's address, as given on the last return filed by him, shall be sufficient\nnotice to advise the holder of revocation and the effective date\nthereof. (3)\n\nThe holder of a\nrevoked permit shall without delay surrender the permit to the District Office\n\nAudit Bureau. (4)\n\nAny person\nwillfully using a permit after revocation may be subject to the criminal\npenalty provisions of section\n1817\nof the Tax Law and the Penal Law. (See Part\n536 of this Title.)\n(h) Direct payment permits for omnibus carriers engaged in local transit\nservice. (1)\n\nDirect payment permit for\nthe purchase or use of an omnibus. (i) An\nomnibus carrier engaged in local transit service may make application for a\ndirect payment permit with respect to his purchase or use of an omnibus. Such\npermit will not be granted unless the carrier has filed a certificate of\nregistration with the Department of Taxation and Finance and the department has\nissued a certificate of authority to the carrier. (ii)\nA copy of the omnibus direct payment\npermit must be furnished to the omnibus carrier's vendor in lieu of payment of\nsales or compensating use tax on each such purchase. (iii)\n\nThe omnibus carrier must pay the tax\n(after allowing for any credit taken by the applicant pursuant to subdivision\n[b] of section\n1119\nof the Tax Law) on such purchase or use of an omnibus\ndirectly to the department at the time of filing the return covering the period\nin which the omnibus was purchased or used. (2)\n\nDirect payment permit for all taxable\npurchases. An omnibus carrier may apply for a direct payment permit with\nrespect to all of its purchases. Such permit may be granted by the District\n\nOffice Audit Bureau of the Audit Division if the carrier qualifies under the\nprovisions of subdivision (b) of this section. (3)\n\nOmnibus carriers who receive direct\npayment permits under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision must comply with\nthe requirements of subdivisions (e) and (f) of this section, and are subject\nto the provisions of subdivisions (d) and (g) of this section.
