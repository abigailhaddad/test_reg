  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 38.3 - Reorganization pursuant to the federal bankruptcy act\n\nState Regulations\n\nReorganizations of New York State public utilities\npursuant to the provisions of the Federal Bankruptcy Act require the approval\nof the Public Service Commission. Upon the submission of such a plan of\nreorganization, the commission will determine if the public interest is\ninvolved. When such a determination is made, the Federal court will be duly\nnotified. Thereafter, public hearings will be held at which the reorganization\ncommittee of the utility must establish by competent proof that the proposed\nplan is in the public interest. It should appear that the securities proposed\nto be issued by the reorganized company do not exceed the value of the property\nto be held by such corporation and that the prospective earnings are sufficient\nto pay a return on the new securities. The approval of the commission to a\nreorganization plan does not relieve the reorganized company from securing\nnecessary consents to the transfer of property, amendments of its certificate\nof incorporation or the issuance of securities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n38.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
