Tit. 10 §§ 7-3.6 - Variance and waivers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In order to allow time to comply with a provision of this Subpart, an operator may submit a written request to the permit-issuing official for a variance. A request for a variance will not be considered unless the operator demonstrates that the health and safety of the public will not be prejudiced by the variance, and that there are practical difficulties or hardships in immediate compliance with the provision. An operator must meet all terms and conditions of an approved variance. (b) In order to obtain a waiver permitting alternative arrangements that do not meet the provisions of this Subpart but do protect the health and safety of the occupants and the public, an operator may submit a written request to the permit-issuing official for a waiver from a specific provision of this Subpart. Such request must demonstrate that the alternate arrangements provide adequate protection of the health and safety of the occupants and public. The permit-issuing official shall obtain and be guided by the recommendation of the State Department of Health prior to granting or denying a waiver. An operator must meet all terms of an approved waiver. A waiver will remain in effect indefinitely unless revoked by the permit-issuing official or the facility changes operators. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
