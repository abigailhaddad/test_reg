(b) The transfer hearing will be conducted by\nan outside hearing officer who is experienced in the child care field and is\nnot an employee of the Division for Youth. A list of the officers and their\nresumes shall be available for public inspection. The hearing officer need not\nbe an attorney. (c) Formal rules of\nevidence will not be in effect at the hearing except that all testimony shall\nbe given under oath administered by someone authorized by the State of New York\nto administer oaths. (d) The\njuvenile delinquent and his representative shall be present during the\npresentation of evidence to the hearing officer; provided, however, that upon\nthe request of either party, the hearing officer may determine that the\njuvenile delinquent should be excused during all or any part of a witness's\ntestimony if it appears that the hearing of such testimony would be harmful to\nthe juvenile delinquent. All witnesses shall be excluded from the hearing until\ncalled to testify, except in no case shall the ombudsman, the youth's\nrepresentative, or the facility's representative be excluded. The\nrepresentative shall assist the juvenile delinquent at the hearing. The\nfacility director or his designee may present any written evidence, including\nbut not limited to clinical evaluations and incident reports, as well as any\noral testimony, in support of the transfer. After presentation of the\nfacility's evidence, the juvenile delinquent and his witnesses will present\ntheir testimony or other evidence in response. Cross-examination shall be\nallowed but shall be limited in the discretion of the hearing officer to\nrelevant and nonrepititious questions. Rebuttal evidence may be presented. The\nhearing officer may question any witness during any presentation. (e) The ombudsman may attend the transfer\nhearing on his own or at the juvenile delinquent's request. (f) The hearing shall be tape recorded, in a\nmanner which reasonably assures a complete and audible recording of the\nhearing, and the tapes and all evidence submitted to the hearing officer shall\nbe sent to the chairperson of the Division for Youth's transfer board and shall\nbe retained by him for two years. The tapes and documentary evidence shall be\navailable for inspection by an attorney for the juvenile delinquent within two\nweeks of the hearing. If the attorney requests a transcript of the hearing or a\ncopy of the documentary evidence, the division shall provide them within a\nreasonable time, but only upon written assurance by the attorney that he shall\nbear the costs thereof. (g) Within\n12 hours of the close of the hearing, the hearing officer shall render an oral\ndecision. If the hearing officer finds by substantial evidence that the\njuvenile delinquent has been shown to be exceptionally dangerous to himself or\nto other persons while at the school or center; or that the juvenile delinquent\nhas demonstrated by a pattern of behavior that he needs a more structured\nsetting; or that the juvenile delinquent is in need of protection and that\nplacement at another facility is unavailable or inappropriate, the hearing\nofficer shall affirm the facility director's decision to transfer the juvenile\ndelinquent. A finding against the school or center shall prohibit the\ntransfer. (h) Within five days\nafter the hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written decision in\nwhich he states the evidence relied upon and the grounds for his decision. In\nthe case of a transfer requested by the juvenile delinquent, the hearing\nofficer shall make a finding that independent evidence exists to justify the\ntransfer. (i) When the written\ndecision is rendered, a copy of it shall be given to the director of the\nfacility in which the juvenile delinquent resides and he, or his designee, shall give a copy to the juvenile delinquent and explain the decision to the\njuvenile delinquent. A copy shall also be given to the youth's representative. If the decision affirms the transfer, a copy shall be sent to the youth's\nparents or guardian and to the Family Court which ordered the\ndisposition. (j) If the hearing\nofficer affirms the decision to transfer the juvenile delinquent and the\ntransfer is made before the written decision is rendered, the director of the\nsecure facility or his designee shall inform the juvenile delinquent of the\ndecision to transfer and explain the reasons to him. The youth's representative\nshall also be notified. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n175-2.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
