Personal decontamination\nsystem enclosures shall be constructed and functional prior to commencing the\nremainder of the Phase II A regulated abatement work area preparation\nactivities. Waste decontamination system enclosures shall be constructed and\nfunctional at the completion of Phase II A preparation activities. After\ninstallation of the personal decontamination system enclosure, all access to\nthe regulated abatement work area shall be via the installed personal\ndecontamination system enclosure. (b) Personal decontamination system\nenclosure--large project. (1)\n\nEnclosure--general. A personal decontamination system enclosure shall be\nprovided outside the regulated abatement work area and attached to all\nlocations where personnel shall enter or exit the regulated abatement work\narea. One personal decontamination enclosure system for each regulated\nabatement work area shall be required. This system may utilize adequate\nexisting lighting sources separate from the decontamination system enclosure, or shall be supplied with a GFCI protected temporary lighting system. The\npersonal decontamination system enclosure shall be sized to accommodate the\nnumber of workers and equipment required for the intended purpose. Such system\nmay consist of existing attached rooms outside of the regulated abatement work\narea, if the layout is appropriate, that can be plasticized and are accessible\nfrom the regulated abatement work area. When this situation does not exist, personal decontamination enclosure systems may be constructed of metal, wood or\nplastic supports covered with fire- retardant plastic sheeting. A minimum of\none layer of six mil fire-retardant plastic sheeting shall be installed on the\nceiling, and walls of the enclosure system. At least two layers of six mil\nfire-retardant reinforced plastic sheeting shall be used for flooring\nprotection of this area. This system must be kept clean, sanitary and climate\ncontrolled at all times in conformance with all Federal, State and local\ngovernment requirements. This system shall remain on-site, operational and be\nused until completion of Phase II C of the asbestos project. (2)\n\nRooms and configuration. The personal\ndecontamination system enclosure shall consist of a clean room, a shower room\nand an equipment room connected in series but separated from each other by\nairlocks. There shall be a curtained doorway separation between the equipment\nroom and the regulated abatement work area, and there shall be a lockable door\nto the outside. (See Figure 1 within this section.) Minimum dimensions for each\nairlock, shower room and equipment room shall be three feet wide by six feet in\nheight, to allow for adequate access to and from the regulated abatement work\narea. (3)\n\nCurtained doorway. An\nassembly which consists of at least three overlapping sheets of six mil\nfire-retardant plastic over an existing or temporarily framed doorway. One\nsheet shall be secured at the top and left side, the second sheet at the top\nand right side, and the third sheet at the top and left side. All sheets shall\nhave weights attached to the bottom to insure that the sheets hang straight and\nmaintain a seal over the doorway when not in use. (4)\n\nFraming. Enclosure systems accessible to\nthe public shall be fully framed, hard-wall sheathed and utilize a lockable\ndoor for safety and security. (5)\n\nSheathing.

If the remote personal decontamination system\nmust be located at the exterior of the building/structure due to space or code\nrestrictions, it shall be constructed within 50 feet of the building/structure\nexit used for access by the asbestos abatement contractor personnel. The\ndecontamination unit shall be cordoned off at a distance of 25 feet to separate\nit from public areas. (3)\n\nAirlocks. At a minimum, two extra airlocks as defined in section\n56-2.1\nof this Part shall be\nconstructed as per paragraph (b)(11) of this section. One shall be constructed\nat the entrance to the equipment room or equipment/washroom. The other extra\nairlock shall be constructed at the entrance to the containment or regulated\nabatement work area(s). These airlocks shall have lockable doorways at the\nentrance to the airlock from uncontaminated areas. These airlocks shall be\ncordoned off at a distance of 25 feet and appropriately signed in accordance\nwith section\n56-7.4\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart. Airlocks shall not be used as a waste decontamination area and shall\nbe kept clean and free of asbestos containing material. (4)\n\nDesignated pathway. The walkway from the\nregulated abatement work area to the personal decontamination system or next\nregulated abatement work area shall be cordoned off and signage installed as\nper section\n56-7.4\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, to delineate it from public areas while in use during Phases II A\nthrough II D. (5)\n\nTravel through\nuncontaminated areas. If at any time a worker must travel through an\nuncontaminated area to access the personal decontamination area, the worker\nshall HEPA-vacuum and/or wet wipe his/her outer protective clothing while in\nthe regulated abatement work area, then proceed into the airlock, which serves\nas a changing area, where he/she shall remove the outer clothing and don a\nclean set of protective clothing. The worker may then proceed to the personal\ndecontamination system enclosure only along a designated pathway as described\nabove. Travel in any other area shall not be allowed. (6)\n\nRemoval. The remote personal\ndecontamination unit shall be removed only after satisfactory clearance air\nsampling results have been achieved. (e) Waste decontamination system\nenclosure--large and small asbestos projects. (1)\n\nEnclosure--general. A waste\ndecontamination system enclosure shall be provided outside the regulated\nabatement work area and shall be attached to the regulated abatement work area. One waste decontamination enclosure for each regulated abatement work area\nshall be required. This system may utilize adequate existing lighting sources\nseparate from the decontamination system enclosure, or shall be supplied with a\nGFCI protected temporary lighting system. The waste decontamination system\nenclosure shall be sized to accommodate the number of workers and equipment for\nthe intended purpose. Such system may consist of existing attached rooms\noutside of the regulated abatement work area, if the layout is appropriate, that can be plasticized and are accessible from the regulated abatement work\narea. When this situation does not exist, enclosure systems may be constructed\nof metal, wood or plastic supports covered with fire-retardant plastic\nsheeting. A minimum of one layer of six mil fire-retardant plastic sheeting\nshall be installed on the ceiling, and walls of the enclosure system. At least\ntwo layers of six mil fire-retardant reinforced plastic sheeting shall be used\nfor flooring protection of this area. This system must be kept clean, sanitary\nand climate controlled at all times in conformance to all Federal, State and\nlocal government requirements. This system shall remain and be used until\ncompletion of Phase II C of the asbestos project. (2)\n\nRooms and configuration. A waste\ndecontamination system enclosure shall consist of a washroom and a holding area\nconnected in series but separated from each other by an airlock. There shall be\na lockable door to the outside, and there shall be a curtained doorway between\nthe washroom and the regulated abatement work area. (See Figure 2 in this\nsection.)\n(3)\n\nCurtained doorway. An\nassembly which consists of at least three overlapping sheets of six mil\nfire-retardant plastic over an existing or temporarily framed doorway. One\nsheet shall be secured at the top and left side, the second sheet at the top\nand right side, and the third sheet at the top and left side. All sheets shall\nhave weights attached to the bottom to insure that the sheets hang straight and\nmaintain a seal over the doorway when not in use. (4)\n\nWashroom. A room/chamber between the\nregulated abatement work area and the holding area in the waste decontamination\nsystem enclosure, where equipment and waste containers are wet cleaned or\nHEPA-vacuumed. Adequate drainage and bag/container wash water shall be provided\nwithin the room/chamber, as well as a sufficient quantity of clean waste\nbags/containers. (5)\n\nEquipment/washroom alternative. Where there is only one exit from the regulated\nabatement work area, the holding area of the waste decontamination system\nenclosure may branch off from the equipment room of the personal\ndecontamination system enclosure. The equipment room will also be used as a\nwaste washroom. (See Figure 3 in this section.)\n(6)\n\nPlastic sheeting. Waste decontamination\nsystem enclosures constructed at the work site shall use at least one layer of\nsix mil fire-retardant plastic sheeting on walls and ceiling. At least two\nlayers of six mil fire-retardant reinforced plastic sheeting shall be used for\nflooring protection of these areas. (7)\n\nEnclosure security. The waste\ndecontamination system enclosure and regulated abatement work area airlock(s)\n(when remote decontamination systems are used) shall be constructed with\nlockable doors to prevent unauthorized entry. Enclosure systems located within\n25 feet of an area of public access shall be fully framed and hard-wall\nsheathed for safety. (8)\n\nDrains. The waste washroom shall be equipped with a wash bin of sufficient size to\nperform waste container washing operations and shall have a submersible pump\ninstalled to collect waste water and deliver it to the shower wastewater\nfiltration system where it shall be filtered in accordance with paragraph\n(b)(9) of this section. (9)\n\nShower/washroom alternative -- small asbestos project. For small asbestos\nprojects with only one exit from the regulated abatement work area, the shower\nroom may be used as a waste washroom. The clean room shall not be used for\nwaste storage, but shall be used for waste transfer to carts, which shall be\nimmediately removed from the enclosure. Waste shall be transferred only during\ntimes when the showers are not in use. (See Figure 4 in this\nsection.)\n(f) Waste\ndecontamination system enclosure -- when remote personal is allowed. When a\nremote personal decontamination system enclosure is allowed and utilized for a\nregulated abatement work area, the following requirements shall apply: (1)\n\nMinor size regulated abatement work area. No specific waste decontamination system enclosure is required for minor size\nregulated abatement work areas. The waste generated shall be immediately\nbagged/containerized within the regulated abatement work area. (2)\n\nSmall and large size regulated abatement\nwork areas. (i) Washroom. An additional\nchamber shall be constructed within the regulated abatement work area, attached\nto the existing airlock used to access the work area.
