  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 82.5 - Notifications\n\nState Regulations\n\nAt least 30 but not more than 120 days prior to a payment\nadjustment and at least 90 but not more than 120 days prior to the expected\nmaturity of a balloon-payment mortgage, a lender shall provide the borrower\nwith notice, in writing, or, where the borrower has consented in advance, via\nelectronic media of the adjustment or of maturity. However, where the loan\ncontract provides that changes in the interest rate shall occur more frequently\nthan changes in the payment, the lender need not notify the borrower of changes\nin the rate, nor of changes in the loan balance or term resulting from a rate\nchange, until notice of a payment adjustment is given or at least annually. For\npurposes of notification, either in writing or, where the borrower has\nconsented in advance, via electronic media, a payment adjustment is considered\nto occur as of the date of the interest rate change immediately preceding the\ndue date of the adjusted payment. In addition, where the loan contract sets out\na schedule of payment adjustments, notice need not be given of payment changes\nmade pursuant to that schedule. With regard to the electronic transmission of\nnotices, a hard-copy of such notice shall be mailed to each applicant who\nindicates that he or she does not have the computer capacity to down-load and\nprint such notice. In those instances in which a hard-copy of the notice is not\nmailed to the applicant, the lender must be able to demonstrate that\ninformation was obtained as to the applicant's computer capacity to down-load\nand print such notice. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n82.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
