  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 14-1.191 - Pre-operational review\n\nState Regulations\n\nIt is the responsibility of the operator of a food service establishment to construct, equip, furnish, maintain and operate the food service establishment under his control in compliance with the requirements of this Subpart and other applicable laws, rules and regulations. Prior to constructing, major renovation, or commencing operation of a food service establishment, the permit-issuing official may require all food service establishments under his control to submit sketches or plans showing the floor layout, equipment, plumbing, ventilation, refuse storage facilities, sewage disposal facilities and similar information. Submission and review of plans does not relieve the operator of a food service establishment or his successor from meeting all requirements of this Subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n14-1.191\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
