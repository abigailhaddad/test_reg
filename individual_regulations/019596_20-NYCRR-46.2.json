  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 46.2 - Methods of accounting\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nutility in this class keeping its accounts on the cash basis will include in\ngross operating income cash received by reason of any sale made or service\nrendered, all amounts allowed as credits against charges for sales made or\nservices rendered, and credits allowed for property of any kind or\nnature. (b) A utility keeping its\naccounts on the accrual basis will include in gross operating income all\nreceipts accrued on its books for the reporting period, but will be permitted\nto deduct such sums as represent, for example, uncollectible accounts, returned\nmerchandise, etc., regardless of when the sales were made or services rendered, thus achieving substantially, if not exactly, the same results as would be\nattained by accounting and reporting on the cash basis. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n46.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
