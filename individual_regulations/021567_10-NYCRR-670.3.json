  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 670.3 - Residential health care facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Notwithstanding the provisions of\nsubdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of section\n670.1\nof this Part, the factors, methodology and procedures to be used by the Public Health Council for\ndetermining the public need for residential health care facility beds shall\ninclude, but not be limited to, the substantive criteria, methodology and\nprocedure set forth in section\n709.3\nof this Chapter and the\nprovisions of subdivision (c) of this section. (b) Any application for establishment wherein\na determination of public need is made pursuant to this section, shall be\nsubject to the provisions of subdivision (d) of section\n670.1\nof this Part. (c) (1)\n\nIn\ndetermining the need for residential health care facilities, beds and services, consideration shall be given to the needs of persons who receive or are\neligible to receive medical assistance benefits at the time of admission to a\nfacility pursuant to title XIX of the Federal Social Security Act and title 11\nof article 5 of the Social Services Law, hereafter referred to as Medicaid\npatients, and the extent to which the applicant serves or proposes to serve\nsuch persons, as reflected by factors including, but not necessarily limited\nto, the applicant's admissions policies and practices. An application by an\napplicant that is or will be a provider that participates in the medical\nassistance (Medicaid) program shall not be approved unless the applicant agrees\nto comply with the requirements of this subdivision. An applicant that, at the\ntime of consideration of its application by the Public Health Council, proposes\nnot to participate in the Medicaid program may be approved, provided all other\nreview criteria have been met, upon the condition that if, in the future, it\ndoes participate in the Medicaid program, it would comply fully with the\nrequirements of this subdivision. (2)\n\nTo ensure that the needs of Medicaid\npatients in an applicant's service area are met and that such patients have\nadequate access to appropriate residential health care facilities, beds and\nservices, applicants shall be required to accept and admit at least a\nreasonable percentage of Medicaid patients as determined pursuant to this\nsubdivision. Such reasonable percentage of Medicaid patient admissions, also\nreferred to herein as the Medicaid patient admissions standard, shall be equal\nto 75 percent of the annual percentage of all residential health care facility\nadmissions, in the long-term care planning area in which the applicant facility\nis located, that are Medicaid patients. The calculation of such planning area\npercentage shall not include admissions to residential health care facilities\nthat have an average length of stay of 30 days or less. If there are four or\nfewer residential health care facilities in a planning area, the applicable\n\nMedicaid patient admissions standard for such planning area shall be equal to\n75 percent of the planning area annual percentage of all residential health\ncare facility admissions that are Medicaid patients or 75 percent of the annual\npercentage of all residential health care facility admissions, in the health\nsystems agency area in which the facility is located, that are Medicaid\npatients, whichever is less. In calculating such percentages, the department\nwill use the most current admissions data which have been received and analyzed\nby the department. An applicant will be required to make appropriate\nadjustments in its admissions policies and practices so that the proportion of\nits own annual Medicaid patient admissions is at least equal to 75 percent of\nthe planning area percentage or health systems agency area percentage, whichever is applicable. (3)\n\nThe\nproportion of an applicant's admissions that must be Medicaid patients, as\ncalculated under paragraph (2) of this subdivision, may be increased or\ndecreased based on the following factors: (i) the number of individuals within the planning area currently awaiting placement\nto a residential health care facility and the proportion of total individuals\nawaiting such placement that are Medicaid patients, provided that patients\nawaiting placement include, but need not be limited to, alternate level of care\npatients in general hospitals; (ii)\nthe proportion of the facility's total patient days that are Medicaid patient\ndays and the length of time that the facility's patients who are admitted as\nprivate paying patients remain such before becoming Medicaid\neligible; (iii)\nthe proportion of\nthe facility's admissions who are Medicare patients or patients whose services\nare paid for under provisions of the Federal Veterans' Benefit Law; (iv)\nthe facility's patient case mix based on\nthe intensity of care required by the facility's patients or the extent to\nwhich the facility provides services to patients with unique or specialized\nneeds; and\n(v) the financial impact\non the facility due to an increase in Medicaid patient admissions. (4)\n(i) An applicant shall submit a written plan, subject to the approval of the department, for reaching the Medicaid patient\nadmissions standard required by this subdivision. The plan shall provide for\nreaching the standard within no longer than a two-year period and the facility\nshall give preference, as necessary, to Medicaid patients in order to reach the\nadmissions standard within the prescribed time period. (ii)\n\nOnce the Medicaid patient admissions\nstandard is reached, the facility shall not reduce its proportion of Medicaid\npatient admissions so as to go below the standard unless and until the\napplicant, in writing, requests the approval of the department to adjust the\nstandard and the department's written approval is obtained. In reviewing\nrequests to adjust a facility's Medicaid patient admissions standard, the\ndepartment shall consider factors which may include, but need not be limited\nto, those factors set forth in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this\nsubdivision. (iii)\n\nAfter a\nfacility's initial Medicaid patient admissions standard has been reached, the\ndepartment may increase such facility's Medicaid patient admissions standard, based on the criteria set forth in this subdivision, if the percentage of\n\nMedicaid patients admitted by residential health care facilities in the\nfacility's planning area or health systems agency area, as appropriate, increases due to factors other than an increase in Medicaid patient admissions\nby the applicant. (5)\n(i) Subject to the provisions of subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph, after the phase-in period provided for in paragraph (4)\nof this subdivision, a facility shall be prohibited from failing, refusing or\nneglecting to accept or admit a Medicaid patient for whom it is otherwise able\nto provide care, regardless of whether the level of reimbursement received for\nsuch patient is less than the rate the facility charges private pay patients, unless the facility has reached and is maintaining compliance with the Medicaid\npatient admissions standard imposed by this subdivision. Compliance with the\nrequirements of this subdivision shall be determined on the basis of a\nfacility's total annual admissions, so that a facility may exercise its\ndiscretion in determining when during a year it will admit a sufficient number\nof Medicaid patients to maintain its Medicaid patient admissions\nstandard. (ii)\nA facility may be\nexempt from the requirement of admitting a Medicaid patient in order to meet or\nmaintain its Medicaid patient admissions standard if it can demonstrate in\nwriting to the satisfaction of the commissioner that the Medicaid patient was\ndenied admission solely in order to admit another patient who had a greater\nneed of residential health care facility services, as determined by the\nintensity of care anticipated to be required by such patient, and that there\nwas only one bed available in the facility at the time of the admission\ndecision to accommodate a new admission. Facilities shall not be required to\nobtain prior department approval in order to accept a non-Medicaid patient in\nplace of a Medicaid patient pursuant to this subparagraph, but shall maintain\nsufficient documentation including, but not necessarily limited to, a copy of\nthe patient review instrument for the patient admitted and the Medicaid patient\ndenied admission in order to justify the admission decision. Copies of such\ndocumentation shall be provided to the department upon request. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
