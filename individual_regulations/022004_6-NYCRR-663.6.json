  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 663.6 - Continuance of interim permits; pending applications\n\nState Regulations\n\nAt the time of this Part becomes effective in a\nparticular area, some persons in that area will have already obtained wetlands\ninterim permits or will have applied for them in accordance with the\ndepartment's freshwater wetlands interim permit regulations (Part 662 of this\n\nTitle). (a) A person who has already\nobtained an interim permit for a particular project may rely on it, and need\nnot obtain any additional permit or letter of permission under this Part, except as described in subdivision (b) of this section. If the project for\nwhich the permit was issued is located in a village, town, city or county which\nhas adopted a local law or ordinance and is implementing the act in accordance\nwith section 24-0501 of the act and Part 665 of this Title, no additional\npermit for the project will be required under that local legislation, but the\ncommissioner will forward to the local government a copy of the interim\npermit. (b) Upon receipt of an\napplication for renewal or extension of an interim permit, the department may, as per section\n621.11\nof this Title, treat such a\nrenewal or extension as a new application under Part 663. Furthermore, the\ndepartment may modify, suspend or revoke such an interim permit pursuant to\nsection\n621.13\nof this Title. (c) If an application for an interim permit\nhas been submitted for a proposed project and a decision on that application\nhas not been made at the time this Part becomes effective, the department will\nretain regulatory jurisdiction over that application and will treat the\napplication as an application for a permit or letter of permission under this\n\nPart. Accordingly, additional information may then be required in order to\ncomply with this Part. (d) If the\nproposed project described in subdivision (b) or (c) of this section is located\nin a village, town, city or county which has assumed regulatory authority\npursuant to section 24-0501 of the act and Part 665 of this Title, the\ndepartment staff will consult with the local government prior to making a\ndecision on the application.
