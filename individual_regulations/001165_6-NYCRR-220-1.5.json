  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 220-1.5 - Gaseous emissions from kiln stacks\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The owner or operator of a portland\ncement kiln may purchase and use fuel with sulfur content exceeding the fuel\nsulfur limitations required by Subpart 225-1 of this Title, provided that the\nburning of such fuel will not result in emissions of sulfur compounds\n(expressed as sulfur dioxide) to the outdoor atmosphere at a rate greater than\nwould result through the use of fuels otherwise mandated by Subpart\n225-1. (b) The owner or operator of\na portland cement kiln must submit a reasonably available control technology\n(RACT) analysis to the department for emissions of oxides of nitrogen\n(NO\nx\n) from the kiln that proposes a RACT emission\nlimit(s), and identifies the procedures and monitoring equipment to be used to\ndemonstrate compliance with the proposed RACT emission limit(s). The RACT\nemissions limit(s) shall be expressed in pounds of NO\nx\nper ton of clinker produced. (1)\n\nBy December\n1, 2010 the owner or operator of a portland cement kiln that was in operation\nprior to the effective date of this Subpart must submit a RACT analysis, and an\napplication for a permit modification in accordance with the provisions of\n\nSubpart 201-6 of this Title unless the existing NO\nx\ncontrol equipment and emission limit(s) are determined to be RACT. RACT, as\napproved by the department, must be implemented by July 1,2012. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator of a portland\ncement kiln that was not in operation prior to the effective date of this\n\nSubpart must submit a RACT analysis prior to start-up of the kiln. RACT, as\napproved by the department, must be implemented upon start-up. (3)\nRACT analyses must include the available\nNO\nx\ncontrol technologies, the projected effectiveness of\nthe technologies considered, the costs for installation and operation for each\nof the technologies, and the technology and the appropriate emission limit(s)\nselected as RACT considering the costs for installation and operation of the\ntechnology. For a portland cement kiln that was in operation prior to the\neffective date of this Subpart and for which the existing\nNO\nx\ncontrol equipment has been determined to not be\nRACT, the RACT analysis must also include a schedule for installation of\ncontrol equipment. (4)\n\nApproved\nRACT determinations will be submitted by the department to the UnitedStates\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency for approval as separate State Implementation\n\nPlan revisions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n220-1.5\n\nRenumbered from 220-1.6\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register August 21, 2024/Volume XLVI, Issue 34, eff. 9/5/2024\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. (a) The\nowner\nor\noperator\nof any portland cement dust dump will operate such dust dump in a manner which will minimize the horizontal dimensions of the working face. (b) In cases where the dump is within 1,500 feet of any receptor, the\nowner\nand/or\noperator\nmust seal the dust dump either by crusting or backfill twice yearly. (c) If dumping procedures do not provide adequate protection from dust reentrainment, the\nowner\nand/or\noperator\nmust install a windbreak. If visible emissions still reach the property line, the\nowner\nand/or\noperator\nmust precondition the\nwaste\ndust. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n220-1.5",
