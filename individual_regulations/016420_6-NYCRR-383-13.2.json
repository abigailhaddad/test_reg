(b) The permittee must retain and\npreserve the originals of the records required by this Part in legible and\nreadily retrievable form in a secure building located on the disposal site\nuntil the end of the operation period. At that time, the permittee must move\nthe originals of the records to a secure building located off of the disposal\nsite, and the permittee must retain and preserve the originals of the records\nuntil the end of the institutional control period. At the end of the\ninstitutional control period, the custodial agency must retain and preserve the\noriginals of the records. (c) The\npermittee must maintain one set of copies of the records required by this Part\nfor routine use and access in a recordkeeping system approved in the\npermit. (d) The permittee must\nmaintain one set of copies of the records required by this Part, in a form\napproved in the permit, at a location other than the disposal site until the\nend of the institutional control period. The copies must be stored at a\nlocation other than that used, after the operational period, for storage of the\noriginal records. (e) At the end of\nthe closure period, a copy of the waste package documents listed in subdivision\n(f) of this section and the disposal unit documents listed in subdivision (g)\nof this section must be sent to the chief executives of the county or counties\nin which the facility is located and to any other person designated by the\ndepartment at that time. (f) The\nwaste package documents must provide a complete record of each waste package\nthrough receipt, inspection, acceptance, treatment, reprocessing, repackaging\nand disposal. The documents must also provide summaries of the total quantities\nof waste which have been received, accepted, treated, processed, repackaged and\ndisposed by categories. The documents must contain physical and chemical\ndescriptions of the waste, the waste volumes, the radionuclides contained and\ntheir quantities, and the total radioactivity by waste classification. The\nlocation of each waste package must be identified on a grid system, shown on\ncross-sectional and plan views of each disposal unit. (g) The disposal unit documents must provide\na complete record of each disposal unit. The documents must include a\ndescription of the disposal unit; as-built drawings of the disposal unit; a\nchronological history of the construction of each disposal unit and of disposal\noperations in the disposal unit; summaries of waste contained in the disposal\nunit; a description of the closure of the disposal unit; a grid system of the\ndisposal unit allowing the location of the disposal of waste shipments to be\nidentified; and cross-sectional and plan views of the disposal unit. (h) The permittee must store information\npertaining to the receipt and disposal of waste as required in this section. (1)\n\nThe permittee must maintain access to a\ncomputer recordkeeping system for electronic storage and manipulation of\ninformation, including information transcribed from manifests that accompany\nshipments of waste to the land disposal facility. The following information\nmust be stored in the computer recordkeeping system: (i) the date that the shipment was received\nat the land disposal facility; (ii)\nthe date of disposal of the waste; (iii)\na unique shipment manifest\nnumber; (iv)\nthe location of\ndisposal at the disposal site; (v) the volume of any pallet, bracing, or other materials that are included with\nwaste shipments, or are generated from on-site activities, and are disposed of\nas contaminated or suspect materials; and\n(vi)\nthe manifest information required by\n\nPart 381 of this Title. (2)\n\nThe permittee must develop and use the\ncomputer recordkeeping system in accordance with a quality assurance program\nthat, at a minimum, addresses system development, verification, operation, maintenance, and modification. The permittee must impose controls (e.g., backup\ndata storage, access controls) to ensure that the stored data is protected\nagainst loss or unauthorized modification. (3)\n\nInformation must be transferred to and\nstored in the computer recordkeeping system as the waste is received, inspected, and disposed of, unless the computer recordkeeping system is\ndisabled at the time the waste is received, inspected, or disposed of. In the\nevent that the computer recordkeeping system is disabled or access is lost, information must be transferred to and stored in the computer recordkeeping\nsystem within five business days after access to the computer recordkeeping\nsystem has been restored, unless the department approves in writing a longer\ntime period. (4)\n\nTemporary\ndisablement of or loss of access to the computer recordkeeping system need not\npreclude waste disposal, provided that the information is transferred and\nstored after access is restored and within the time period required in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nInformation may be transferred to and\nstored in the computer recordkeeping system before receipt of waste, provided\nthat the accuracy of the transferred information is confirmed when the shipment\nis received, inspected, and disposal is completed. (6)\n\nThe permittee must enter information into\nthe computer recordkeeping system according to quality control procedures to\nensure accurate transcription of data. (7)\n\nThe computer recordkeeping system must be\ncapable of tracking the origin, transport, disposition, and characteristics of\nindividual waste packages. (8)\n\nThe\ncomputer recordkeeping system must be capable of manipulating the data in a\nvariety of ways, as required to make reports as specified by this Part or the\npermit. At a minimum, the computer recordkeeping system must be able to\ndetermine parameters such as waste volume, radionuclide inventories, radiation\nlevels, or chelating agent content as a function of other parameters such as\nthe waste description, the solidification agent, the waste or stability class, the waste generator, or groups of waste generators ( e.g., nuclear utilities, hospitals).
