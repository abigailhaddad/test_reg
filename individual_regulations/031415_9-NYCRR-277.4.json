(d) Fixed payment for moving expenses-nonresidential moves. (1)\n\nBusiness. A displaced business may be eligible to choose a fixed\npayment in lieu of the payments for actual moving and related expenses, and\nactual reasonable reestablishment expenses provided by section\n277.4\n(c) and\n277.4\n(f) respectively.

The displaced business is eligible for the\npayment if the agency determines that: (i) The business owns or rents personal\nproperty which must be moved in connection with such displacement and for which\nan expense would be incurred in such move; and, the business vacates or\nrelocates from its displacement site. (ii)\n\nThe business cannot be relocated without\na substantial loss of its existing patronage (clientele or net earnings). A\nbusiness is assumed to meet this test unless the agency determines that it will\nnot suffer a substantial loss of its existing patronage. (iii)\n\nThe business is not part of a\ncommercial enterprise having more than three other entities which are not being\nacquired and which are under the same ownership and engaged in the same or\nsimilar business activities. (iv)\n\nThe business is not operated at a displacement dwelling solely for the purpose\nof renting such dwelling to others. (v) The business contributed materially to\nthe income of the displaced person during the two taxable years prior to\ndisplacement. (2)\n\nDetermining the number of businesses. In determining whether two or more displaced legal entities\nconstitute a single business which is entitled to only one fixed payment, all\npertinent factors shall be considered, including the extent to which: (i) the same premises and equipment are\nshared; (ii)\nsubstantially\nidentical or interrelated business functions are carried out and business and\nfinancial affairs are commingled; (iii)\nthe entities are held out to the\npublic, and to those customarily dealing with them, as one business; and\n(iv)\nthe same person or closely\nrelated persons own, control or manage the affairs of the\nentities. (3)\n\nFarm\noperation. A displaced farm operation may choose a fixed payment, in\nlieu of the payments for actual moving and related expenses and actual\nreasonable reestablishment expenses, in an amount equal to its average annual\nnet earnings as computed in accordance with paragraph (5) of this subdivision, but not less than $1,000 nor more than $20,000. In the case of a partial\nacquisition of land which was a farm operation before the acquisition, the\nfixed payment shall be made only if the agency determines that: (i) the acquisition of part of the land\ncaused the operator to be displaced from the farm operation on the remaining\nland; or\n(ii)\nthe partial\nacquisition caused a substantial change in the nature of the farm\noperation. (4)\n\nNot-for-profit organization. A displaced not-for-profit organization may choose a fixed\npayment of $1,000 to $20,000, in lieu of the payments for actual moving and\nrelated expenses and actual reasonable reestablishment expenses, if the agency\ndetermines that it cannot be relocated without a substantial loss of existing\npatronage (membership or clientele). A not-for-profit organization is assumed\nto meet this test, unless the agency demonstrates otherwise. Any payment in\nexcess of $1,000 must be supported with financial statements for the two\n12-month periods prior to the acquisition. The amount to be used for the\npayment is the average of 2 years annual gross revenues less administrative\nexpenses. Gross revenues may include membership fees, class fees, cash\ndonations, tithes, receipts from sales or other forms of fund collection that\nenables the not-for-profit organization to operate. Administrative expenses are\nthose for administrative support such as rent, utilities, salaries, advertising\nand other like items as well as fund-raising expenses. Operating expenses for\ncarrying out the purposes of the not-for-profit organization are not included\nin administrative expenses. The monetary receipts and expense amounts may be\nverified with certified financial statements or other documents required by the\nagency. (5)\n\nAverage annual\nnet earnings of a business or farm operation. The average annual net earnings of a business or farm\noperation are one-half of its net earnings before Federal, State, and local\nincome taxes during the two taxable years immediately prior to the taxable year\nin which it was displaced. If the business or farm was not in operation for the\nfull two taxable years prior to displacement, net earnings shall be based on\nthe actual period of operation at the displacement site during the two taxable\nyears prior to displacement, projected to an annual rate. Average annual net\nearnings may be based upon a different period of time when the agency\ndetermines it to be more equitable. Net earnings include any compensation\nobtained from the business or farm operation by its owner, the owner's spouse\nand dependents. The displaced person shall furnish the agency proof of net\nearnings through income tax returns, certified financial statements, or other\nreasonable evidence which the agency determines is\nsatisfactory.
