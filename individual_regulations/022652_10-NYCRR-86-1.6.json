Except as otherwise provided in this Part, or in accordance with specific determination by the commissioner, allowable costs shall be determined by the application of the principles of reimbursement developed for determining payments under the title XVIII (Medicare) program. (b) Allowable costs may not include costs for services that have not been approved by the commissioner. (c) Allowable cost shall include a monetary value assigned to services provided by religious orders and for services rendered by an owner and operator of a facility. (d) Allowable costs may not include amounts in excess of reasonable or maximum title XVIII (Medicare) costs or in excess of customary charges to the general public. This provision shall not apply to services furnished by public providers free of charge or at a nominal fee. (e) Allowable costs shall not include expenses or portions of expenses reported by individual facilities which are determined by the commissioner not to be reasonably related to the efficient production of service because of either the nature or amount of the particular item.

(g) [\nReserved\n]\n(h) Allowable costs shall not include costs which principally afford diversion, entertainment or amusement to their owners, operators or employees. (i) Allowable costs shall not include any interest charged or penalty imposed by governmental agencies or courts, and the costs of policies obtained solely to insure against the imposition of such a penalty. (j) Allowable costs shall not include the direct or indirect costs of advertising, public relations and promotion except in those instances where the advertising is specifically related to the operation of the facility and not for the purpose of attracting patients. (k) Allowable costs shall not include costs of contributions or other payments to political parties, candidates or organizations. (l) Allowable costs shall include only that portion of the dues paid to any professional association which has been demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the commissioner, to be allocable to expenditures other than for public relations, advertising and political contributions. Any such costs shall also be subject to any cost ceilings that may be promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section. (m) [\nReserved\n]\n(n) Allowable costs shall not include any element of cost, as determined by the commissioner, to have been created by the sale of a medical facility. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
