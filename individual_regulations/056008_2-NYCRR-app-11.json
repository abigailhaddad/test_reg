Codes R. & Regs. tit. 2, Appendices, app 11\n\nState Regulations\n\nImage\n\nDear Mr. Levitt: This is in reply to your letter of August 6, 1969, wherein you\nstate that following the suggestions advanced at the conference held with\n\nCommissioner Thrower on June 17, 1969, your staff has prepared an Official\n\nRegulation to be promulgated by you which will establish the New York State\n\nPublic Employees Group Life Insurance Plan pursuant to the legislative mandate\nof Chapters 336 and 371, Laws of 1969. Prior to the formal implementation of\nthe Plan you request a ruling to the effect that the proceeds of the group life\ninsurance will be exempt, for Federal income tax purposes, pursuant to section\n101(a)(1)\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code of 1954. You state that the development of the Official Regulation has\nbeen coordinated with the Superintendent of Insurance of the State of New York, to whose supervision the Plan will be subject. Mr. Theodore R. Ayervais, Deputy\n\nSuperintendent and General Counsel of the Insurance Department, indicates in a\nletter dated July 30, 1969, that he has reviewed the proposed Regulation, as\nwell as the pertinent provisions of the Retirement and Social Security Law as\namended by Chapters 336 and 371, Laws of 1969, and that the provisions of the\n\nLaw dealing with the guaranteed ordinary death benefits clearly encompass the\nelements of risk shifting and risk distribution and that the benefits provided\nunder the Plan are in the form of group life insurance. Section 97.1 of the proposed Regulation provides that since the\ninception of the New York State Employees' Retirement System and of the New\n\nYork State Policemen's and Firemen's Retirement System, an ordinary death\nbenefit has been payable upon the death in service of a member thereof pursuant\nto sections\n60, 60-a, 360, and\n360-a\nof the Retirement and Social\n\nSecurity Law, Section 97.2 provides for the establishment of the New York State\n\nPublic Employees Group Life Insurance Plan in order to provide the death\nbenefits to its members. Honorable Arthur Levitt\n\nEach qualified member is to be insured from January 1, 1970\nthrough March 31, 1971, and during such effective period the insurance coverage\nwill constitute a contractual relationship, the benefits of which will not be\ndiminished or impaired. The State Comptroller may, from time to time, extend\nthe effective period of insurance. In no case will the amount payable under the\n\nPlan upon the death of a member exceed $50,000. Pursuant to section 97.3 separate reserve funds will be\nestablished, The separate funds, known as the New York State Public Employees\n\nGroup Life Insurance Plan Reserve Funds are to be established within the New\n\nYork State Employees' Retirement System and the New York State Policemen's and\n\nFiremen's Retirement System, respectively, to be held in trust by the State\n\nComptroller. The funds will consist of all premiums paid by the State and by\nparticipating employers and other monies received and paid into the funds for\ngroup term life insurance purposes, and of the investment earnings upon such\nmonies, and will be used only to pay the group term life insurance. Based on an actuarial determination of the initial liability of\nthe Plan, there will be segregated and transferred from the pension\naccumulation funds of the New York State Employees' Retirement System and of\nthe New York State Policemen's and Firemen's System to the reserves held in\ntrust by the State Comptroller, such amounts necessary to pay anticipated group\nterm life insurance claims. Pursuant to section 97.5 the Actuary will\ninvestigate the Plan's claim experience as provided by section\n11\nof the Retirement and Social Security Law\nand on the basis of such investigation end recommendation of the Actuary, the\n\nComptroller will certify the premium rates computed to be necessary to fund the\ngroup term life insurance authorized to be paid by the Plan. After the close of\neach fiscal year, the Comptroller will determine the premium which the State\nand the participating employers are required to pay into the reserve funds to\ndischarge the obligations of the Plan for the past fiscal year. Section\n101(a)(1)\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code of 1954 contains the general rule that the proceeds of life\ninsurance contracts, if paid by reason of the death of the insured, are\nexcludable from the gross income of the recipient. We have considered the provisions of the proposed Regulations\nwhich will establish the New York State Public Employees Group Life Insurance\n\nPlan. If the Plan is implemented in the manner proposed, it is our opinion that\nthe proceeds of the group term life insurance paid by reason of the death of a\nqualified member of the Plan will be excludable from the gross income of the\nrecipient pursuant to the provisions of section 101(a)(1) of the Code.
