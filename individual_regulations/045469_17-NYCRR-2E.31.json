  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2E.31 - Interchange Exit Numbering\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE Paragraph 09. INSERT the following paragraphs: Support: 04A New York currently uses the consecutive exit numbering\nmethod for interchanges. New York expects to eventually adopt a reference\nlocation sign exit numbering system, and also discontinue the use of cardinal\ndirections suffixes as part of the exit number in favor of a suffix letter\n(e.g., A, B, C). Standard: 06A An E5-1bP exit number plaque shall be used only in\nconjunction with the E5- 1 Exit Gore sign (see Section 2E.37). Guidance: 07A Exit number plaques should be designed in accordance\nwith the MUTCD, but with square bottom corners and no bottom border. The text\non the plaque should be centered vertically within the green area of the plaque\nface. 07B An exit number plaque should be positioned such that\nits right or left bottom edge is offset from the edge of the sign it\nsupplements by a distance equal to the sign's corner radius. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2E.31\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
