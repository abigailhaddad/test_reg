The top of any\nguy derrick mast more than 25 feet in height shall be steadied by not less than\nsix wire rope guys so spaced as to make the angles between adjacent guys\napproximately equal. (2)\n\nAttachment. Wire rope guys shall be secured by either weldless steel sockets, thimble and splice connections, thimbles with proper size and numbers of rope\nclips or cast steel guy plates having grooved bearing surfaces of the same\nshape and size as the wire rope thimbles, using a spliced or wire rope clip\nattachment. (3)\n\nAnchoring. Guys\nshall be attached to strong permanent construction or to substantial \"dead men\"\nsecurely anchored in the ground. (c) Breast-type derricks. Breast-type\nderricks shall be guyed from both the front and rear. Where front guys are not\npossible because of derrick operation, provisions shall be made to prevent such\nderricks from tipping over backward. Breast-type derricks which are operated by\nhand power shall have hand grips securely and positively fastened to the shaft\nand a ratchet and pawl shall be provided which will hold any load. (d) Derrick construction. (1)\n\nMaterials. The mast, boom, frame and\nsimilar parts of a derrick shall be constructed of suitable steel or of\nselected wood of proper strength and durability. (2)\n\nMast fittings. On derricks which have\nbooms larger than the masts, the gudgeon pins, mast tops and goosenecks shall\nbe securely fastened to the tops of the masts to prevent such parts from\npulling out when the booms are raised. (e) Derrick capacity charts. (1)\nA capacity chart shall be provided for\nevery derrick and such chart shall be posted conspicuously on the job site. Unless furnished by the manufacturer or builder of the derrick, the capacity\nchart shall be prepared and certified by a professional engineer licensed to\npractice in the State of New York and a copy thereof shall be submitted, upon\nrequest, to the commissioner. (2)\nA\nderrick shall not lift any load that exceeds the relevant maximum specified on\nits capacity chart. (f) Derrick boom raising. The boom of any derrick shall not be raised from the\nlevel of the surface on which the derrick rests other than by the use of its\nown hoisting capabilities. The design, construction and length of the boom\nshall be such that there is no undue stress imposed on the derrick structure or\nmechanism during such raising operations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
