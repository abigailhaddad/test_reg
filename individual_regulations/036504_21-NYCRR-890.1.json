  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 890.1 - Reduce water use\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe commission will undertake a long-range continuing\nprogram to reduce water use throughout the basin for the purposes of: (a) reducing the likelihood of severe low\nstream flows that can adversely affect fish and wildlife resources and\nrecreational enjoyment; (b) assisting in the maintenance of good water quality by provision of minimum\ndilution flows and repulsion of salinity; and\n(c) deferring the need for construction of\nnew storage reservoirs and other water supply structures. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n890.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
