  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 551.12 - Additional criteria for inpatient projects\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In addition to the criteria of sections\n551.7 and\n551.10\nof this Part, applications\nfor inpatient projects shall be reviewed against criteria in this\nsection. (b) No application for the\nissuance of an operating certificate of a psychiatric inpatient unit of a\nhospital licensed pursuant to article 28 of the Public Health Law, which is\napplying for an operating certificate pursuant to Part 580 of this Title, shall\nbe granted unless the applicant hospital is, or will be, approved to admit\nindividuals in emergencies pursuant to section\n9.39\nof the\n\nMental Hygiene Law, except as or provided pursuant to the authority granted in\nsection\n31.04\n(a)(4)\nof the Mental Hygiene Law and as\noutlined below. (1)\n\nThe commissioner shall\nwaive this requirement for a period of two years upon determination that: (i) there is no public need for additional\nbeds for emergency psychiatric admission in the service area. In determining\nsuch need, the factors which the commissioner shall consider include, but shall\nnot be limited to: (a) the current and\nprojected population characteristics of the service area, including the\nprevalence of mental illness in the population; (b) the current patterns of utilization of\npsychiatric services and the service demands of the service area; and\n(c) the existence and availability of\npsychiatric resources available in the community; (ii)\nthe hospital lacks the physical capacity\nto reasonably accommodate such emergency admissions without extensive\nstructural changes. For the purpose of this section, extensive structural\nchanges shall consist of any project for which the costs of accommodating\nemergency admissions will unreasonably increase the psychiatric inpatient rate\nof the hospital; (iii)\nthe hospital\ndoes not and reasonably could not provide the scope of services necessary to\nassure adequate and appropriate psychiatric care and treatment for patients in\nemergency situations; or\n(iv)\nthe\nhospital has agreed to accept referrals of involuntary psychiatric patients\nunder an emergency admissions system which has been approved by the\ncommissioner. In determining whether such a proposed system should be approved, the commissioner, in consultation with the local governmental unit, shall\nconsider whether such proposal: (a) defines\nthe specific area to be served; (b) provides for sufficient beds for emergency psychiatric admissions to meet the\npublic needs identified for the service area pursuant to subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph; (c) describes the\nmanner in which the patterns of admission in the service areas will be\naltered; (d) projects the number of\nadmissions that will occur at the hospital covered under the proposal; and\n(e) effectively addresses the\navailability of emergency psychiatric admissions to meet the projected public\nneeds. (2)\n\nNo\nhospital without an on-site emergency room shall be required to accept patients\nin need of emergency observation, care and treatment. No application for the\nissuance of an operating certificate for a psychiatric inpatient unit of such\nhospital shall be accepted until the hospital has agreed to accept referrals of\ninvoluntary psychiatric patients under an emergency admission system which has\nbeen approved by the commissioner, except the commissioner may waive this\nrequirement for a period of two years pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nNothing in this\n\nPart shall prevent the commissioner from requiring a hospital to admit patients\nunder section\n9.39\nof the\n\nMental Hygiene Law on an emergency basis if the health or welfare of the public\nso requires. (4)\n\nPrior to granting\na waiver to a hospital, the commissioner shall consider the comments of the\ndirector of the local governmental unit of the specific service area. (c) In reviewing projects for\ninpatient beds, the Office of Mental Health shall consider: (1)\nthe advice and recommendations of the\nlocal governmental unit; (2)\ncurrent or anticipated psychiatric treatment alternatives to acute psychiatric\ninpatient care which lessen the need for inpatient care; (3)\nwhether the project improves the network\nof services available to patients in the service area; (4)\nfor projects serving children and\nadolescents: (i) conformance with admission\nand utilization review practices which emphasize the shortest lengths of stay\nclinically appropriate in order to prevent the child's or adolescent's\nestrangement from family and community; (ii)\nconformance with discharge practices\nwhich emphasize planning for discharge from the time of admission, prevention\nof family or community estrangement, and post discharge follow-up\nresponsibility for all patients; and\n(iii)\nconformance with the policy of\ndeveloping smaller, specialized children/adolescents units that serve children\nand adolescents as close to their own communities as possible. Specifically, the Office of Mental Health will consider location of beds, number of beds, travel distances to obtain service in the proposed service area, public\ntransportation, other access factors, and service area plans for children and\nadolescent beds.
