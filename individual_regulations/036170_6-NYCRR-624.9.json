  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 624.9 - Evidence, burden of proof and standard of proof\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Evidence.'\n(1)\n\nAll evidence submitted must be relevant\nand all rules of privilege will be observed. However, other rules of evidence\nneed not be strictly applied. (2)\n\nAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its value as proof is\nsubstantially outweighed by a potential for unfair prejudice, confusion of the\nissues, undue delay, waste of time or needless presentation of repetitious or\nduplicative evidence. (3)\n\nWhere a\npart of a document is offered as evidence by one party, any party may offer the\nentire document as evidence. (4)\n\nWhenever possible, an object that is the subject of testimony will be exhibited\nat the evidentiary hearing. It must be properly identified as relevant, and it\nmust be shown that it has not changed substantially due to the passage of time\nor any other reason. (5)\n\nEach\nwitness must be sworn or make an affirmation before testifying. Opening, closing and other unsworn statements are not evidence but will be considered as\narguments bearing on evidence. (6)\n\nThe ALJ or the commissioner may take official notice of all facts of which\njudicial notice could be taken and of other facts within the specialized\nknowledge of the department. When official notice is taken of a material fact\nnot appearing in the evidence in the record and of which judicial notice could\nnot be taken, every party must be given notice thereof and, on timely request, be afforded an opportunity, prior to final decision, to dispute the fact or its\nmateriality. (7)\n\nHearsay. The\nproponents of hearsay evidence must demonstrate that the evidence offered falls\nwithin one of the following exceptions: (i) any writing or record, whether in the form of an entry in a book or otherwise, made as a memorandum or record of any act, transaction, occurrence or event, if\nthe ALJ finds that it was made in the regular course of any business and that\nit was the regular course of the business to make it, at the time of the act, transaction, occurrence or event, or within a reasonable time thereafter. All\nother circumstances of the making of the memorandum or record, including lack\nof personal knowledge by the maker, may be proved to affect its weight, but\nwill not affect its admissibility. The term business includes a business, profession, occupation and calling of every kind; (ii)\nwhere a public officer is required or\nauthorized by special provision of law, to make a certificate or an affidavit\nto a fact ascertained, or an act performed by the officer in the course of the\nofficer's official duty, and to file or deposit it in a public office of the\n\nState, the certificate or affidavit so filed or deposited is prima facie\nevidence of the facts stated; (iii)\na statement signed by an officer or a qualified agent or representative having\nlegal custody of specified official records of the United States or of any\nstate, county, town, village or city or of any court thereof, or kept in any\npublic office thereof, that a diligent search of the records was made and no\nrecord or entry of a specified nature was found, is prima facie evidence that\nthe records contain no such record or entry, but only if the statement is\naccompanied by a certification that legal custody of the specified official\nrecords belongs to that person. The certification must be made by a person\ndescribed in CPLR 4540; (iv)\nall\nmaps, surveys and official records affecting real property, that are on file in\nthe State in the office of the registrar of any county, any county clerk, any\ncourt of record or any department of the State or City of New York are prima\nfacie evidence of their contents; (v) all written statements, charts, tabulations and similar data offered in evidence at the evidentiary hearing, upon a showing that the evidence offered is reliable, relevant and\nprobative; (vi)\nexceptions provided\nby CPLR article 45 or other law; or\n(vii)\nthe evidence offered is shown to be\nreliable, relevant and probative. (b) 'Burden of proof.'\n(1)\n\nThe applicant has the burden of proof to\ndemonstrate that its proposal will be in compliance with all applicable laws\nand regulations administered by the department. (2)\n\nWhere the department has initiated\nmodification, suspension or revocation proceedings, the department staff bears\nthe burden of proof to show that the modification, suspension or revocation is\nsupported by the preponderance of the evidence. (3)\n\nWhere an application is made for permit\nrenewal, the permittee has the burden of proof to demonstrate that the\npermitted activity is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations\nadministered by the department, including those renewal applications the\ndepartment treats as new pursuant to Part 621 of this Title. A demonstration by\nthe permittee that there is no change in permitted activity, environmental\nconditions or applicable law and regulations constitutes a prima facie case for\nthe permittee. (4)\n\nThe burden of\nproof to sustain a motion will be on the party making the motion. (c) 'Standard of proof.' Whenever\nfactual matters are involved, the party bearing the burden of proof must\nsustain that burden by a preponderance of the evidence unless a higher standard\nhas been established by statute or regulation. This subdivision does not modify\nor supplement the questions that may be raised in a proceeding brought pursuant\nto CPLR article 78. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n624.9\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register August 21, 2024/Volume XLVI, Issue 34, eff. 8/21/2024\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
