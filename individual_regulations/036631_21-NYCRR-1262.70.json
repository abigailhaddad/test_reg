  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1262.70 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Brakes. Every\ntank and refueling service vehicle shall be equipped with manually controlled\nholding or parking brakes. All such brakes shall be controlled by the driver of\nthe vehicle and set during fuel transfer or parking. Vehicles equipped with air\nbrake interlocks between brakes and power take-off units shall be fitted with a\nproperly marked emergency brake release located at the front bumper of the\nvehicle to permit brake release and towing the vehicle in event of an\nemergency. Vehicles equipped with air brakes shall be fitted with a low\npressure alarm buzzer audible under all conditions of operation, located in the\ndriver's cab. Vehicles arranged for bottom loading shall have the brake's\nsystem interlocked with the bottom loading valve housing cover so the vehicle\nbrakes are set and the vehicle could not be moved until the bottom loading hose\nlines are disconnected and the housing cover is latched close. (b) Propulsion and pumping engine. The\npropulsion and pumping engine shall be arranged with safeguards to reduce\nignition sources to a minimum. (1)\n\nThe\ncarburetor shall be fitted with an approved back flash arrestor (baffled and\nscreened air cleaner acceptable). (2)\n\nAll wiring shall be adequately insulated, fastened to eliminate chaffing and affixed to terminal connections by tight\nfitting snap or screw connections with rubber or similar insulating and\nshielding covers, and molded boots. (3)\n\nGlass or plastic bowls or compartments\nfor carburetors, fuel pumps or filters shall not be used unless the failure of\nsuch devices discontinues fuel supply to the engine and will not permit gravity\ndischarge of fuel from the engine fuel supply tank. (4)\n\nStarting motors and generators should be\nmounted at least two feet above the ground level or be of fully enclosed\npattern preventing any fuel spill vapors from being drawn into the starter or\ngenerator through ventilating openings. (c) Engine and exhaust system. The vehicle\npropulsion and product pumping engine shall be installed under or forward of\nthe cab portion of single units, on the tractor of semi-trailer units or\notherwise located in a separate compartment independent of the cargo tank and\nnot subject to flooding or leakage of product from the cargo tank, any pumps or\nproduct handling components. The engine compartment must be independent of the\ncargo tank, fully ventilated and accessible for fire fighting. Engine exhaust\nsystems, including the muffler and the exhaust line shall be separated by at\nleast three inches from the engine fuel system, from all combustible material, and shall not be exposed to accumulations or leakage of grease, oil, gasoline\nor the product carried. An approved muffler shall be installed and no muffler\ncutout shall be used. The muffler tail pipe shall be turned down and terminate\nnot less than three feet horizontally from the cargo tank, and from the fuel\nhandling equipment. (d) Fuel system\nfor propulsion of tank vehicles and refueling service vehicles. (1)\n\nFuel tanks. The fuel tank used in the\nsystem for propulsion of the vehicle shall have a maximum capacity of 45\ngallons of fuel, and shall be installed within the frame of the vehicle or\notherwise protected against mechanical injury. The tank shall be arranged to\nvent during filling operations and permit draining without removal from the\nmountings. Tanks installed within the cab of a vehicle shall be filled and\nvented from outside of the cab. (2)\n\nFeed system. The fuel for propulsion of the vehicle shall be delivered to the\nengine by a mechanical or electrical pump. No readily combustible material\nshall be used in the engine exhaust system. The fuel feed lines shall be\nimpervious to corrosive action of the fuel used, and shall be so arranged that\nthe suction shall be taken from the top of the tank; such feed lines shall have\nadequate strength for their purpose and shall be well secured against chaffing\nand vibration. The carburetor shall be equipped with standard air\ncleaner-backflash arrestor; direct drainage of overflow gasoline shall be\nprovided for. No glass bowls, glass gauges or readily breakable parts are to be\nused in any part of the fuel feed system, except that a glass bowl may be used\non a fuel pump provided it is so constructed and installed that if it breaks, the engine will automatically stop. Starting motors and generators should be\nmounted at least two feet above the ground level or be of fully enclosed\npattern preventing any fuel spill vapors from being drawn into the starter or\ngenerator through ventilating openings. (3)\n(i) When refueling service vehicles are self-propelled by means of gasoline or\ndiesel engines, the requirements as enumerated in subdivision (c) of this\nsection shall be complied with, except that the muffler tailpipe shall\nterminate ahead of the fueling equipment preferably at the front bumper and the\nexhaust pipe be directed downward toward the ground. (ii)\n\nWhen refueling vehicles are\nself-propelled by means of electrical energy, driving motors and electrical\ncontrols shall be of explosion-proof design suitable for class I, division I\nlocations as defined in article 500 of the national electric code. Battery\ncompartment shall be fully insulated by nonconductive lining and leads firmly\nfastened on insulated blocks to prevent short circuits. (iii)\n\nWhen refueling vehicles are without\nmotive power and are equipped with draw handles, the draw handles shall be\nhinged and held in the vertical position when not in use by a suitable holding\ndevice. The maximum height of the draw handle in the vertical position shall\nnot exceed six feet from the ground level to the highest point. (e) Filters. All filter\nsystem and fuel storage vessels containing 30 gallons or more fuel shall be\nmade of steel and shall have all openings for product transfer arranged to\nprevent gravity discharge. All other fuel handling rigid plumbing shall be of\nmetal construction. (f) Tires. All\ntank and refueling service vehicles shall be equipped with pneumatic\ntires. (g) Wiring and lighting. Ignition wiring, both primary and secondary, shall be fully insulated, adequately supported and protected against chaffing. Terminals shall be firmly\nattached and spark plug attachments shall be further protected by an insulating\ntight fitting shroud of the molded boot type. Tank or refueling service\nvehicles shall not be equipped with any artificial lighting other than electric\nlighting. Lighting circuits shall have overcurrent protection by means of fuses\nor circuit breakers. Over current protection devices shall not be rated more\nthan 115 percent of the allowable ampacity of the conductor. Where circuits\nfeed motor loads, the overcurrent protection devices shall be capable of\ncarrying the starting current of the motor, but shall not exceed 250 percent of\nthe motor full load current. Wiring of light circuits other than standard\nfactory wiring serving the vehicle engine and front lights shall have\nsufficient carrying capacity to prevent dangerous heating and sufficient\nmechanical strength being flame retardant, moisture-heat- and oil- resistant\ntype MTW (Underwriters' Laboratories approved) and constructed for service\nconditions, and shall be secured, insulated and protected against physical\ndamage by encasing in metallic tubing with all connections made at standard\nmetal outlet boxes or at standard fixtures. Artificial light may be omitted on\nservice vehicles not self-propelled provided the refueling service is fitted\nwith two red reflectors (highway vehicle type) on both sides and both ends\napproximately 18 inches above the ground level, located to indicate the width\nand length within six inches of the maximum. (h) Hose used for product transfer shall be\ninspected daily and checked for leaks, worn spots, worn gaskets, and fittings. Hose having cuts, nicks, worn or weak spots should be replaced or removed for\nstandard hydrostatic pressure testing. The test pressure should be 150 psi for\naverage usage applied by hand pump on a fully charged, air free hose and\nmaintained for at least five minutes. (i) Special equipment. Every tank vehicle and\nrefueler service vehicle in addition to regular headlights and tail lights as\nindicated in the sections on non-fueling equipment, sections\n1262.75\n-1262.81 infra, shall be\nfitted with a warning stop light actuated when the brakes are applied, directional signal lights both front and rear, under driver control to signal\nturning of the vehicle. Tank vehicles equipped with operating decks or\nsuperstructures shall be fitted with clearance lights on each corner of the\ndeck or superstructure, amber in color, to indicate the height, width and\nlength of the vehicle, visible from all directions.
