  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.943 - Deviation from reassessment intervals\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Waiver from reassessment interval in\nlimited situations. In the following limited instances, the department and OPS\nmay allow a waiver from a reassessment interval required by section\n255.939\nof this Part if the\ndepartment and OPS find a waiver would not be inconsistent with pipeline\nsafety. (1)\n\nLack of internal inspection tools. An operator who uses internal inspection as an assessment method may be able to\njustify a longer reassessment period for a covered segment if internal\ninspection tools are not available to assess the line pipe. To justify this, the operator must demonstrate that it cannot obtain the internal inspection\ntools within the required reassessment period and that the actions the operator\nis taking in the interim ensure the integrity of the covered segment. (2)\n\nMaintain product supply. An operator may\nbe able to justify a longer reassessment period for a covered segment if the\noperator demonstrates that it cannot maintain local product supply if it\nconducts the reassessment within the required interval. (b) How to apply. If one of the conditions\nspecified in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section applies, an operator may\nseek a waiver of the required reassessment interval. An operator must apply for\na waiver in accordance with\n49 U.S.C. section\n60118(c), at least 180 days\nbefore the end of the required reassessment interval, unless local product\nsupply issues make the period impractical. If local product supply issues make\nthe period impractical, an operator must apply for the waiver as soon as the\nneed for the waiver becomes known. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.943\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
