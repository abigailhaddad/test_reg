  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 2 - Standards for Transactional/non-litigation Settings\n\nState Regulations\nINTRODUCTION\nSection 1 of the Standards of Civility, while in many respect s applicable to attorney conduct generally, in certain\nrespect s addresses the practice of law in the setting of litigation and other\nformal adversary proceedings, where conduct is governed by a variety of\nspecific procedural rules of order and may be supervised by a judge or other\nsimilar official. This Section 2, which is more directed to transactional and\nother non-litigation settings, should be read with Section 1 as one integrated\nwhole for a profession that has multiple facets and spheres of activity. The differences in practice between\nlawyers' roles and the expectations in litigation and other settings can\nsometimes be significant. Although fewer formal rules of conduct and decorum\napply outside of the litigation setting, lawyers conducting transactional work\nshould keep Section 1 of Standards of Civility in mind, along with the\nfollowing additional items. ADDITIONAL TRANSACTIONAL/NON-LITIGATION\nSTANDARDS\nI. A lawyer\nshould balance the requirements and directions of the client in terms of timing\nwith a reasonable solicitude for other parties. Unless the client specifically\ninstructs to the contrary, a lawyer should not impose deadlines that are more\nonerous than necessary or appropriate to achieve legitimate commercial and\nother client-related outcomes. II. A lawyer should focus on the\nimportance of politeness and decorum, taking into account all relevant facts\nand circumstances, including such elements as the formality of the setting, the\nsensitivities of those present and the interests of the client. III. Where an agreement or\nproposal is tentative or is subject to approval or to further review by a\nlawyer or by a client, the lawyer should be careful not to proceed without\nproper authorization or otherwise imply that authority from the client has been\nobtained when such is not the case.
