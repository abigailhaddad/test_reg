The clerk shall advise the claimant of the right of the claimant or the\ndefendant to request an evening hearing, which shall not be so scheduled if it\nwould cause unreasonable hardship to either party, and the clerk shall schedule\nthe hearing so as to minimize the defendant's time away from employment.

(j) Where, after a claim is filed with the\nclerk, either party to the action desires to implead one or more additional\ndefendants, the clerk shall, upon receipt of the proper fees, issue and mail a\nnotice of claim to each additional defendant under the procedure set forth\nabove.

Either party may be represented by counsel, but no record of the\nproceeding before the arbitrator shall be kept. No expense shall be incurred by\nthe arbitrator except upon the consent in writing of the parties. (4)\n\nAfter the first hearing, neither party\nmay withdraw from the arbitration unless both parties consent to, or the\narbitrator directs, a discontinuance of the proceeding. (5)\n\nThe arbitrator shall make his or her\naward in writing and file the same forthwith, together with an opinion, if any, with the clerk of the commercial claims part. Unless both parties file a\nrequest in writing not to enter judgment, the clerk shall, within two days\nafter the filing of the award, enter judgment in accordance therewith, provided\nthe award has been filed within 30 days from the date of filing the consent.
