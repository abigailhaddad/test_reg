Tit. 9 § 7503.1 - Medical\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definite\narrangements shall be in effect so the services of a physician will be\navailable, on a standby basis, to examine prisoners in cases of illness and\ninjury. As an alternative, and to provide for situations of an emergency\nnature, the facilities of a conveniently located hospital, particularly\nemergency ward services, shall be utilized. (b) Every prisoner to be detained who appears\nto be physically incapacitated due to drug or alcohol intoxication should\npreferably be examined by a physician. Note: Experience has firmly established\nthat an alcoholic odor emanating from a prisoner can obscure a serious physical\ndeficiency such as narcotic drug addiction, stroke, diabetic coma, heart\nattack, etc., or an abnormal mental condition. (c) No medication shall be given to a\nprisoner unless authorized or prescribed by a physician. (d) A record of medical attention provided\nfor a prisoner shall be maintained. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
