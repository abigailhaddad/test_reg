(1)\n\nHistoric property may be acquired only by\na not-for-profit corporation. The boundaries of the real property to be\nacquired may not exceed the boundaries as listed in the Register nomination, except that the acquisition of a contiguous buffer zone or ancillary property\nwhich, in the opinion of the commissioner, is essential to the protection of\nthe listed property shall be considered eligible for grant\nassistance. (2)\n\nPriority will be\ngiven to those acquisition proposals which are necessary in order to prevent an\nimmediate threat to the property. Such threats include demolition, impairment, erosion, slumping, vandalism and relic collecting. (3)\n\nEligible costs related to acquisition\ninclude legal and other professional fees, appraisal fees, purchase options and\nproject signs when part of an approved scope of work and within the approved\nperiod of the acquisition project. (4)\n\nAppraisals must be performed no more than\n12 months prior to the acquisition of real property. The cost of obtaining an\nappraisal is an allowable cost if an acquisition grant is subsequently awarded. If a property is valued at $100,000 or more, two appraisals must be obtained. If the property is valued at less than $100,000, one appraisal is sufficient. If the property is valued at less than $5,000, a short form appraisal may be\nused at the discretion of the commissioner. Appraisals shall be prepared by an\nactive consultant appraiser in accordance with the requirements of the\noffice. (5)\n\nFor acquisition at less\nthan the appraised market value, the buyer must provide to the commissioner a\nsigned and notarized statement from the seller indicating that the buyer has\nbeen informed of the appraised market value and is satisfied with the price\neven though it is less than the appraised fair market value. (b) Development. (1)\n\nEligible development activities include\nimprovement, restoration, preservation, rehabilitation, protection, reconstruction, archeology and interpretation of historic properties. The\ndevelopment of an archeological site shall have as its principal objective the\nprotection, stabilization or preservation of the site and its archeological\nresources. All work undertaken on a historic property must conform to the\n\nSecretary of the Interior's standards. (i) Relocation of a historic building, structure or object shall be allowable only\nwhen necessary for its preservation, and with the written approval of the\ncommissioner prior to relocation. The commissioner will grant approval only if\nit appears the relocation will not result in removal of the property from the\n\nNational or State Register. (ii)\n\nCosts of landscaping are allowable as follows: (a) historically documented restoration or\nreconstruction of gardens, plantings, grounds and grading to attain historic\nappearance and a compatible setting for the historic property; (b) grading and site work for purposes of\ndrainage, safety and protection; (c) improvements necessary to facilitate\naccess for disabled patrons. (iii)\n\nCosts of project furnishings are\nallowable as part of a development project as follows: (a) when furnishings are original pieces of\nfurniture or permanently attached items that are integral to the property; or\n(b) when furnishings are of\ndocumented historical design or are reconstructions based upon documented\noriginal furnishings. (iv)\n\nFor all development projects, adequate\ndocumentation for the work must be prepared as follows: (a) Drawings, plans, specifications and\nrequests for proposals must detail the exact scope of any work to be performed. Drawings must be accurately drawn to scale so that measurements can be verified\nat the project site. (b) Provisions\nof all qualified professional services necessary for design, construction\nmonitoring and contract administration shall be the responsibility of the grant\nrecipient. (c) Review of plans and\nspecifications and requests for proposals by the office is only for the purpose\nof determining project conformance with the Secretary of the Interior's\nstandards. (d) All predevelopment\nresearch and design (including for archeology) must be completed, reviewed and\napproved by the office prior to the commencement of construction\nwork. (2)\n\nNonconstruction development activities are those which relate directly to the\ndevelopment, implementation, operation and monitoring of development projects, whether they are funded with grant assistance or are associated costs used as\nmatching share. They include the following: (i) preparation of predevelopment plans, specifications, cost estimates and other contract documents; (ii)\npreparation of feasibility\nstudies; (iii)\npreparation of\nhistoric structure reports, historic landscape reports, archeological, architectural and historic research reports; (iv)\npreparation of project completion\nreports, and archeological investigation reports; and\n(v) project signs and a limited number of\ninterpretive signs or plaques. (3)\n\nArcheological development activities. All identification, evaluation, curation, interpretation\nand protection activities shall be conducted under the supervision of a\nprofessional archeologist as defined in Part 435 of this Title. (i) Because disturbance of archeological\nsites is in general discouraged by the office, such disturbance will only be\nfunded if it meets the following criteria. (a) Data recovery may be required to determine the presence of significant\narcheological deposits that might be disturbed by a project. (b) If a development project for a property\nwill disturb an area that has archeological value and the development project\ncannot be altered so as to avoid such disturbance, data recovery or other\nmitigative measures will be required. (c) If a development project is dependent\nupon information that can only be obtained through archeological investigation, the area may be tested to the extent necessary to design and perform the\napproved development activity. (d) If public interpretation of a property is dependent upon the information that\nwould be obtained by archeological testing, such testing may be carried out\nonly to the extent essential for that interpretation. (ii)\n\nPreparation of reports and\ndocumentation, and curation or exhibition of artifacts or other materials are\nactivities eligible for funding only during the project period. (a) Appropriate maps, sketches, profiles, and\nfield notes must be completed to record information about the archeological\nresources and the methods and techniques employed. (b) A written report of all results of the\ninvestigation meeting contemporary professional standards must be prepared. Copies must be provided to the commissioner upon request. (c) Archeological collections and\naccompanying data and records must be curated in a repository meeting\ncontemporary professional standards and the Secretary of the Interior's\nstandards.

(c) Ineligible acquisition and development\nactivities include the following: (1)\n\nAcquisition. (i) acquisition, either by\npurchase, gift or donation which occurs outside the approved project period. An\nacquisition that has occurred prior to project approval by the commissioner\nshall not be eligible for grant assistance or as matching share; and\n(ii)\nphased acquisition. (2)\n\nDevelopment. (i) development work (except minor\ninvestigative activity undertaken as part of approved predevelopment work) done\noutside the approved project period. This includes construction, report\nwriting, curation and exhibition; (ii)\nwork not included in the approved scope\nof work as outlined in the project agreement (and as may be subsequently\namended); (iii)\nwork which in the\nopinion of the commissioner does not conform to the Secretary of the Interior's\nstandards; (iv)\nwork which has not\nbeen advertised or competitively bid as required; (v) routine maintenance work on those\nportions of historic properties which have been previously repaired or\nrehabilitated with grant assistance provided under these regulations or through\nthe Federal historic preservation fund; and\n(vi)\narcheological data recovery or extensive\ntesting conducted under conditions other than those described in paragraph (b)\n(3) of this section.
