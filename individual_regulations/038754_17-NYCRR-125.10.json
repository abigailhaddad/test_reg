  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 125.10 - Commercial driveways\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\ncommercial driveway permit application shall be accomplished by plans or\ndrawings clearly indicating the following features of the site and abutting\nhighways. The department may require the following information to be prepared\nby a professional engineer, licensed land surveyor or a licensed architect. (1)\n\nLocation and dimensions of existing\nhighway pavement, curbs, guide rail, medians, sidewalks, utilities, traffic\nsigns, signals, pavement markings and right-of-way and property\nlines. (2)\n\nExisting and proposed\nbuildings and appurtenances. (3)\n\nDesign features to be incorporated in proposed construction or reconstruction: (i) width, pavement type and thickness of\ndriveways; (ii)\nradius of driveway\nreturn and other points of curvature; (iii)\ndriveway grades or profile view of\ndriveway; (iv)\nangle of driveways\nrelative to the roadway centerline; (v) location of proposed median openings and\nguide rail; (vi)\ndimensions of\nroadside control islands and driveway medians; (vii)\ndimensions and elevations of curbs and\nsidewalks relative to pavement edge; (viii)\nlocation of authorized traffic signs, pavement markings and proposed advertisement signs; (ix)\nexisting and proposed drainage\nfeatures; (x) size, type and grade\nof driveway culverts; (xi)\nhighway\ndrainage structures; (xii)\ndirection of surface water flow on applicant's property; (xiii)\ndistance from each existing and\nproposed driveway on the site to: (a) the\nnearest side road in each direction if within 1,000 feet; (b) nearest driveway on adjacent\nproperty; (c) streets, roads or\ndriveways opposite the site; (d) adjacent property lines; (xiv)\nnorth directional arrow; (xv)\nin addition, for major commercial\nentrances, details of internal traffic circulation, parking, traffic control\ndevices, actual or estimated traffic volumes and any proposed additional\npavement lanes or widening shall be provided. This information and the plans\nsubmitted shall be prepared by a professional engineer; (xvi)\nany additional information required by\nthe department. (b) (1)\n\nAll\ncommercial driveways shall have a paved surface extending from the edge of the\ntravel lane to the highway right-of-way line. Where the highway right-of-way is\ncloser than 10 feet to the edge of the travel lane, the paved surface shall\nextend at least 10 feet back from the edge of the travel lane. The material and\nthickness of commercial driveways within the highway right-of-way shall be\ndesigned to provide adequate support for the volume and character of traffic\nusing the driveway. This information shall be shown on the plans or drawings\naccompanying the permit application and shall be subject to review and approval\nby the department. (2)\n\nThe existing\nhighway shoulder material is to be removed and the shoulder area paved with\nadequate driveway material as specified by the department. If a dual commercial\ndriveway is constructed with driveway halves less than 75 feet apart, the\nentire shoulder area between the dual driveways shall be replaced with adequate\ndriveway material. (3)\n\nAll material\nused in the construction of a driveway shall meet department specifications and\nis subject to department approval on a case-by-case basis. (c) (1)\n\nThe\ndesign criteria given for minor commercial driveways provides operational\nsafety and ease for turning movements for passenger cars and most\ntrucks. (2)\n\nThe outline of the\ncorner treatment of a minor commercial driveway (see sections\n125.13, figure 1A; 125.15 and\n125.16 of this Part) is determined in the same manner as that for residential\ndriveways except that section\n125.21\nis used for standard\ncommercial driveways and section\n125.20\nof this Part is used for\nminor commercial driveway-home business. (3)\nA corner angle of 90 degrees is standard\nexcept for dual system type driveways. Angles between 80 and 100 degrees are\nacceptable. Angles less than 80 degrees or more than 100 degrees should not be\nused except where dictated by physical conditions, and unusual traffic patterns\netc. For the dual system driveway, 120 degree corner angles are standard. Values down to 90 degrees are permissible. (4)\n(i) Commercial driveway. For two-way driveways (see section\n125.13\n) a width of 24 feet is\nstandard. Widths of 22 feet to 30 feet are permissible. For divided driveways\n(see section\n125.15\n) a width of 16 feet is\nstandard with a range of 12 feet to 24 feet permitted. For the dual system type\n(see section\n125.16\n) the standard width is 16\nfeet for one-way driveways with permissible values ranging from 12 feet to 24\nfeet, and 24 feet for two-way driveways with permissible values from 22 to 30\nfeet. (ii)\n\nMinor commercial\ndriveway-home business commercial. For two-way driveways (see section\n125.13\nof this Part) a width of 14\nfeet is standard. Widths of 12 feet to 16 feet are permissible. For the dual\nsystem type (see section\n125.16\nof this Part) the standard\nwidth is 10 feet for one-way driveways with permissible values ranging from 8\nfeet to 12 feet. (5)\n\nValues in section\n125.21\nshall be standard for minor\ncommercial driveways. Other values may be used in situations where a lack of\nproperty frontage or other considerations mandate a narrower driveway opening\nor where there are no trucks using the driveway. (6)\n\nValues in section\n125.20\nof this Part shall be\nstandard for home business commercial driveways. Other values may be used in\nsituations where a lack of property frontage or other considerations mandate a\nnarrower driveway opening or where there are no trucks using the\ndriveway. (d) For a\ndivided commercial driveway (see section\n125.15\n) a median shall be provided\nto separate the opposing traffic movements. The median width (M) may range from\n4 to 16 feet. Medians or islands separating opposing flows of a divided or dual\nsystem driveway shall extend far enough up the driveway to adequately control\ntraffic. The median or island may extend beyond or end before the right-of-way\nline depending on the length of divider needed and the existing right-of-way\ndepth. One hundred feet is normally a desirable length for the divider. The end\nof the median should be as close to the highway pavement edge as possible\nsubject to the following limitations: (1)\n\nThe\nnear end of the median shall be located a sufficient distance from the edge of\npavement to allow unimpeded left turns by the appropriate design\nvehicle. (2)\n\nIn the case of a\ncurbed highway, the end of the driveway median shall be at least four feet in\nback of the curb line. (3)\n\nIn case\nof a highway with shoulders, the end of the median shall not infringe on the\nshoulder. (4)\n\nAny physical barrier\nin a median should be located beyond the vehicle recovery distance of traffic\non the highway. (e) The\nprocedure for physical layout of the driveway corners shall be the same as that\nfor residential driveways. (f) Frontage of all commercial property shall be controlled by positive means such\nas curbing or ditches to provide access only at designated driveways. The\npurpose of the access control is to direct entering and exiting vehicles into a\nwell-defined flow pattern and separate traffic movement on the private property\nfrom the highway traffic. This will provide the maximum safety for motorists\nand cause the least interference with traffic flow on the highway and on the\nproperty. Any exceptions to this policy shall be considered as outlined in the\n\nGeneral Policy Section. (g) When\nislands are used, the width of the island area, measured at right angles to the\nhighway, should be at least one-half the width of the widest driveway. For\nexample, a commercial property with a pair of 14-foot wide one-way driveways\nshould have at least a 7-foot wide island area. Proper delineation should be\nprovided. Where curbing exists at or near the edge of pavement, at least the\nfront of the island area should be defined with curbing which should follow the\nalignment of and be similar to the existing curbing. (h) On highways with shoulders, the island\narea shall not encroach on the usable shoulder width. Where there is a drainage\nditch along the frontage of the commercial property, the ditch may be used as a\nbarrier and the designated driveways carried across the ditch. Delineation\nshould be provided to guide motorists and to prevent their driving into the\nditch (see section\n125.18\n). (i) A minimum of 15 feet should be provided\nbetween the right-of-way line and the near edge of a building, structure, or\nappurtenance serving vehicular traffic. This distance should be sufficient to\npreclude the servicing and parking of vehicles on State property. (j) In non-traffic bearing areas of\ncommercial entrances, use of loose stone such as pea gravel as a mulch or for\ndecorative effect shall not be allowed without a suitable binder. (k) In rural areas, larger radii may be used\nto accommodate higher speeds and/or larger design vehicles if the department\ndetermines it will not adversely affect the safety and operational\ncharacteristics of the highway. The accommodation of larger vehicles and higher\nspeeds should not be accomplished by the use of driveway widths in excess of\nthose allowed in this Part. (l) On\nprojects where no new right-of-way is being acquired and the property owner has\nbeen using State-owned right-of-way for parking or other purposes, the\nimposition of standard driveway controls may create an economic hardship. In\nsuch cases, narrower islands, a ditch or a single line of barrier may be used. If the permittee will be allowed to use a portion of the right-of-way, the\n\nRegional Real Estate Office should process a Permit for Use of State Owned\n\nProperty. (m) In situations where\nthe entrance cannot be developed for a depth equal to or approaching the\ndistances which produce a standard throat entrance, as shown in section\n125.13, figure 1B, the width of\nthe throat should range from 30 to 50 feet with the majority being within 35 to\n45 feet. In such cases, the width selected for a particular driveway and the\nwidth of the barrier (measured at right angles to the road) should be based on\nthe operational safety and economic requirements at that location. (n) If angle parking is allowed on the\nlandowner's side of the island, the island width shall be a minimum of four\nfeet to prevent parked cars from overhanging into the shoulder area. (o) Use of a single line of barrier should be\nlimited to locations where an island of four or more feet in width cannot be\ninstalled and where the single line of barrier will not create a roadside\nhazard. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n125.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
