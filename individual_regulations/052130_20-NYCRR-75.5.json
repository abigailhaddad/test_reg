  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 75.5 - Records to be kept by agents and others\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 474, 475, 482-a and 488\n(a) General. (1)\n(i) Every licensed cigarette agent must keep complete and accurate records of every\npurchase, sale or other acquisition or disposition of cigarettes and cigarette\ntax stamps handled. In addition, every wholesale dealer and retail dealer must\nkeep such records with respect to all cigarettes handled. All records of such\nacquisitions and dispositions of cigarettes and cigarette tax stamps, as the\ncase may be, must be either separate and distinct from all other records\npossessed or the cigarette transactions thereon must be clearly distinct from\nall other transactions. Moreover, separate records must be maintained for each\nof an agent's or dealer's business locations and such records must be further\ndivided to reflect separately a person's activities as an agent, as a wholesale\ndealer and as a retail dealer if such person serves in more than one capacity. Such records may be used to satisfy, in part, a vendor's obligations for sales\ntax purposes pursuant to section\n533.2\nof this\n\nTitle; however, unless a vendor's records are clearly in accord with this\nsection, such vendor's records may not be used with respect to the cigarette\ntax. Complete and accurate records must also be kept by agents, dealers and any\nother persons subject to the provision of article 20 and/or article 20-A of the\n\nTax Law for any other information that the Department of Taxation and Finance\nmay require, including sufficient information so as to complete and\nsubstantiate any return, application or other document required by or pursuant\nto the authority of such articles. (ii)\n\nIn addition to the recordkeeping\nrequirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, licensed cigarette agents\nmust also keep complete and accurate records relating to the schedule required\nto be filed by section\n75.1\n(f) of this Part. (2)\n\nEvery\nperson who transports cigarettes in the State and every person who stores\ncigarettes in the State must keep a complete and accurate record of: (i) the names and addresses of the persons\nfor whom such cigarettes are transported or stored; (ii)\nthe names and addresses of the persons\nto whom such cigarettes are delivered or released from storage; (iii)\nthe quantities of cigarettes\ntransported or stored; and\n(iv)\nthe\ndates of such transportation or storage. (b) (1)\n\nAt\nthe time of delivering cigarettes to any person in New York State, other than\nthe ultimate consumer, each agent and each dealer of cigarettes must make a\ntrue duplicate invoice for each shipment of cigarettes. The invoice must be\neither separate and distinct from any other invoice or the cigarette\ntransactions thereon must be reflected in a portion of the invoice exclusively\ndesignated for cigarette transactions. Such invoice must show the following\ninformation: (i) the name and address of the\nconsignor or seller of such cigarettes; (ii)\nthe name and address of the consignee or\npurchaser to whom delivery is made; (iii)\nthe date of delivery; and\n(iv)\nthe number of packages of each type of\ncigarettes delivered (\ni.e., regular/king size, 100/120 mm size\nor any other description indicative of a price differential for purposes of the\n\nCigarette Marketing Standards Act) and the number of cigarettes contained\ntherein. Agents and dealers delivering cigarettes must retain, as\npart of their records of cigarettes sold or otherwise disposed, one such\ninvoice and shall deliver or cause the delivery of such duplicate invoice to\nthe consignee or purchaser. Agents and dealers receiving such cigarettes, as\nconsignees or purchasers, must procure such second invoice, indicate the date\nof receipt thereon and retain such invoice as part of their records of\ncigarettes purchased or otherwise acquired. (2)\n\nEvery person who possesses or transports\nany unstamped packages of cigarettes upon the public highways, roads or streets\nof the State, is required to have, in such person's actual possession, invoices\nor delivery tickets for such cigarettes. Such invoices or delivery tickets must\nshow: (i) the name and address of the\nconsignor or seller; (ii)\nthe name\nand address of the consignee or purchaser; (iii)\nthe quantity and brands of the\ncigarettes transported; and\n(iv)\nthe name and address of the licensed cigarette agent who has or who shall\nassume the payment of the cigarette tax. In the event such cigarettes are exempt from tax as\nprovided in this Title, in lieu of subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, such\ninvoices or delivery tickets must clearly indicate the basis of such exemption. The absence of such invoices or delivery tickets will be prima facie evidence\nthat such person is a dealer in cigarettes in this State and is subject to the\nprovisions of articles 20 and 37 of the Tax Law. (c) (1)\n\nRecords, including invoices, required\npursuant to this section, must be in such form and contain such other\ninformation as the Department of Taxation and Finance prescribes. Such records\nmust be preserved for a period of three years, and upon oral or written demand\nby the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance or any duly authorized\nrepresentative of the Commissioner such records must be made available for use\nand inspection by the department. (2)\n\nThe Commissioner of Taxation and Finance\nand such duly authorized representatives may in verification of the amount of\nany tax due under article 20 of the Tax Law examine the books, papers, invoices\nand other records of any person in possession, control or occupancy of any\npremises where cigarettes are placed, stored, sold or offered for sale, and the\nequipment of any such person pertaining to the stamping, sale and delivery of\ncigarettes taxable under such article, as well as the stock of cigarettes in\nany such premises or vehicle. Each such person must give to the Commissioner or\nsuch duly authorized representatives the means, facilities and opportunities\nfor such inspection and examination.
