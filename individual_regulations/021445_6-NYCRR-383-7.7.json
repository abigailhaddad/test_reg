  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 383-7.7 - Additional design and construction requirements for underground mined repositories\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General requirements. (1)\n\nThe applicant must\nuse site-specific geologic information in designing and assessing requirements\nfor the underground mined repository. (2)\n\nDocuments containing detailed design and\nconstruction information must be submitted in the permit application. In\naddition to the documents required pursuant to Subpart 383-3 of this Part, these documents must include all relevant site-specific data and descriptions\nregarding the characteristics of the geologic unit or units around the\nexcavation; proposed support and rock stabilization methods; design\ncalculations of critical support elements; seismic analyses, and a map or maps\nof the underground mined repository at a scale of not less than one inch to 100\nfeet. (3)\n\nThe underground mined\nrepository must be designed and constructed so that any surficial subsidence\nresulting from the mine will not create a significant depression that could\nresult in surface waters' ponding and draining into the groundwater system in\nwhich the underground mined repository is constructed. (4)\n\nThe underground mined repository must be\ndesigned so that areas under construction are isolated from radioactive waste\nalready in place. (b) Structural stability requirements. (1)\n\nStructural stability analyses must be performed by a licensed engineer\nutilizing site-specific engineering properties. (2)\n\nThe underground mined repository and\nassociated facilities must be designed to remain structurally stable after the\noccurrence of any single design-basis major phenomena. (3)\n\nThe excavation techniques used in\nconstruction must be designed and implemented to minimize: (i) the potential for increasing the flow of\ngroundwater through the surrounding rock; and\n(ii)\nthe potential for creating a pathway for\ngroundwater or radionuclide movement. (4)\n\nThe proposed excavation and underground\nsupport systems must be based on site-specific engineering properties of the\ngeologic unit. A minimum factor of safety of two must be used in the design for\ncalculated load conditions under normal operating conditions. (5)\n\nThe design and construction of the\nfacility must be sufficiently flexible to allow for necessary modifications in\ndesign and/or construction if conditions are encountered in the geologic unit\nthat are significantly different from those used in the design of underground\nsupports and in the stability analyses. If such conditions are encountered, the\ndesign and/or construction must be modified by a licensed engineer as necessary\nto comply with the requirements of this Part and must be approved by the\ndepartment as a modification of the permit. Design calculations and analyses\nfor any changed conditions must be submitted to the department in the\napplication for permit modification. Construction inspection and documentation\nmust be performed to verify that these changes have been incorporated into the\nconstruction. (c) Water\ninfiltration. (1)\n\nThe underground mined\nrepository must be designed and constructed to minimize and control water\ninfiltration into the underground mined repository during the operation period\nand, as necessary to safely perform facility closure, during the closure\nperiod. During facility closure, the underground mined repository will be\nsealed. After it has been sealed, the underground mined repository will be\nallowed to revert to the natural hydrologic conditions. (2)\n\nThe underground mined repository geometry\nand disposal units must be designed and constructed to direct water that enters\nthe repository during the operation period away from the radioactive waste\nalready in place. (3)\n\nThe disposal\nunits must be designed and constructed with an internal drainage system to\nminimize the contact of infiltrating water with the waste during the operation\nperiod. The drainage system must include collection points so that any water\ninfiltrating the disposal units during the operation period and, as necessary, during facility closure can be monitored, tested, and treated as necessary, before release. (4)\n\nThe disposal\nunits must be designed and constructed to minimize the flow of groundwater\nthrough the disposal unit once the underground mined repository has been sealed\nand allowed to revert to the natural hydrogeologic conditions. (5)\n\nHydrogeologic data used to assess water\ninfiltration characteristics and establish related design and construction\nrequirements for the underground mined repository must be gathered at the\nelevation at which the underground mined repository is to be\nconstructed. (d) Bulkheads, seals, and other engineered barriers. Bulkheads are engineered\nstructural barriers or partitions dividing the underground mined repository\ninto waste disposal compartments and work areas. Seals are engineered features\nthat employ techniques such as water stops, rock keyways, grouts, coatings, adhesive agents, or fluids to achieve airtight and/or watertight closure of the\nunderground mined repository and waste disposal units. Other engineered\nbarriers are designed features of the underground mined repository that serve\nto isolate or prevent water seepage and/or radionuclide migration from one area\nor disposal unit to another area of disposal unit; or from the underground\nmined repository to the surface environment. (1)\n\nThe underground mined repository design\nmust incorporate bulkheads, seals, and other engineered barriers to prevent the\npremature infiltration of water into open areas, the escape of radioactive or\nhazardous gases, and the intrusion of personnel into filled disposal units from\nthe open areas. (2)\n\nThose\nbulkheads, seals, and other engineered barriers whose performance is critical\nto ensure that the underground mined repository facility will meet the\nperformance objectives must be designed based on site-specific\nanalyses. (3)\n\nBulkheads must be\ndesigned to isolate filled and closed units from active work areas and prevent\nthe release of radionuclides from the closed units. (4)\n\nSeals must be designed to deter\nradionuclide migration from the mined repository and disposal units. (i) Seals for shafts and boreholes connecting\nthe underground mined repository area with the ground surface must be designed\nto maintain their integrity and not serve as pathways for radionuclide\nmigration away from the repository for a period sufficient to meet the\nperformance objectives. (ii)\n\nSeals\nfor shafts and boreholes must be designed and located so they do not become\ninfiltration pathways that could adversely affect the ability of the\nunderground mined repository to meet the performance objectives. (5)\n\nMaterials and placement\nmethods for bulkheads, seals, and other engineered barriers must be selected to\nminimize: (i) the potential for creating a\npathway for groundwater to contact the waste; and\n(ii)\nfor radionuclide migration through\nexisting pathways. (e) Ventilation. Air exiting the ventilation\nsystem of the underground mined repository must be monitored and treated, as\nnecessary, to meet the requirements of section\n382.11\nof this Title.
