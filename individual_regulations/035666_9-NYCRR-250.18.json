The commissioner of the appropriate\nappointing agency shall conduct one or more pilot studies whereby a private\nvendor may be accorded preferred source status for purposes of this Part. The\npilot studies shall seek to ascertain the benefits of partnerships between\nprivate industry and those entities accorded preferred source status as\nspecified in this Part. Preferred source status under a partnering arrangement\nmay only be accorded when a proposal to a soliciting agency for commodities or\nservices includes a binding agreement which expires prior to June 30, 2005, with one or more of the entities accorded preferred source status under this\n\nPart. The binding agreement shall provide that: (1)\nthe preferred source shall perform the\nmajority of the work necessary to such offering; (2)\nthe partnering proposal includes bona\nfide long term employment opportunities for persons who could otherwise be new\nclients of an entity previously accorded preferred source status herein; and\n(3)\nthe partnering proposal\noffers the solicited services or commodities at a price less than the price\nthat otherwise would be charged by a preferred source. (b) The commissioner of the appropriate\nappointing agency shall report by December 31, 2004, to the Governor, the\n\nChairperson of the Senate Finance Committee, the Chairperson of the Assembly\n\nWays and Means Committee and the Director of the Budget, the results and\nfindings of each pilot study conducted, pursuant to this Part and include\nrecommendations for improving partnering with preferred sources.
