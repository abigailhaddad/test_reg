Tit. 9 § 298.6 - Terms and conditions on donable property\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThe\nSASP will require each eligible donee, as a condition of eligibility, to file\nwith the agency the appropriate application, a certification of eligibility and\nan agreement to abide by certain terms and conditions as set forth by the GSA. Each form must be signed by the chief executive officer of the donee, agreeing\nto these requirements prior to the donation of any surplus property. (2)\n\nIn addition, the certification of\neligibility and terms and conditions will be printed on the reverse side of\neach, executed to cover each donation transaction and signed by an authorized\nrepresentative of the donee (forms CS 403 and CS 404). (3)\n\nThe following periods of restriction are\nestablished by the SASP on all items of property with a unit acquisition cost\nof $5,000 or more, and on all passenger vehicles: (i) passenger vehicles-18 months from the\ndate the property is placed in use; (ii)\nitems with a unit acquisition cost of\n$5,000 or more -18 months from the date the property is placed in\nuse; (iii)\naircraft (except combat\ntype) and vessels (50 feet or more in length) - 60 months from the date the\nproperty is placed in use. Donation of noncombat aircraft and vessels of 50' or\nmore in length shall be subject to the requirements of a Conditional Transfer\n\nDocument (CTD); (iv)\naircraft\n(combat type) restricted in perpetuity. Donation of combat-type aircraft shall\nbe subject to the requirements of a conditional transfer document (form CS\n408). (4)\n\nThe SASP will\nimpose or reinforce any and all conditions involving special handling or use\nlimitations set by the GSA due to the characteristics of the property\nregardless of the unit acquisition cost. (5)\n\nThe SASP, at its discretion, and when\nconsidered appropriate, may impose additional terms, conditions, reservations\nand restrictions as it deems reasonable on the use of donable property beyond\nwhat GSA and the FMR requires. (6)\n\nThe SASP will impose on all donees the statutory requirement that all items\ndonated must be placed into use or, if the property ceases to be used for a\nfull year and the property is still usable, the property must be returned to\nthe SASP or otherwise transferred as the SASP shall direct. (b) (1)\n\nThe SASP must seek GSA's approval to\namend, modify, or grant releases of, any term, condition, reservation or\nrestriction it has imposed on donated items of personal property which is\nmandated by GSA or the FMR. The SASP may amend, modify, or grant release of, any item, any \"additional\" conditions, reservations or restrictions which the\nSASP has imposed above and beyond what GSA or the FMR requires. (c) Restrictions on Property. The\nSASP may amend or grant releases, during the period of restriction, from any\n\"additional\" SASP imposed terms, conditions, reservations or restrictions the\nSASP has imposed on donated property, in accordance with the following\nstandards, provided that the conditions pertinent to each situation have been\naffirmatively demonstrated to the satisfaction of the SASP, and have been made\na matter of public record. (1)\n\nSecondary\n\nUtilization or Cannibalization. Secondary utilization or cannibalization may be\naccomplished, provided that: (i) disassembly\nof the item, for use of its component parts for secondary use or repair and\nmaintenance of a similar item, has greater potential benefit than utilization\nof the item in its existing form; (ii)\ncomponents with a single item\nacquisition cost of $5,000 or more will remain under the restrictions imposed\nby the transfer document. Components with a single item acquisition cost of\nless than $5,000 will be released from the restrictions imposed by the transfer\ndocument. All components, regardless of acquisition cost will continue to be\nused or be otherwise disposed of in accordance with applicable law and\nregulations; (iii)\na written report\nof such action is made by the donee to the SASP, including a list of all\ncomponents, resulting from the secondary utilization or\ncannibalization.
