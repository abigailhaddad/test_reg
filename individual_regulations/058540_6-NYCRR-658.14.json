  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 658.14 - Shortened procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Whenever it appears to the hearing officer that the hearing can be more\nexpeditiously handled under the informal procedure provided for in this\nsection, he shall suggest to the parties that they consent to the use of such\nprocedure. Parties are free to consent to such procedure if they choose. Declination of consent will not affect or prejudice the rights or interests of\nany party. (b) The request that the\nshortened procedure herein provided be used need not originate with the hearing\nofficer; any party may address a request to the hearing officer asking that the\nshortened procedure be used. (c) The hearing officer, in his suggestion to the parties, shall fix a short period\nwithin which the parties may indicate their consent to the shortened procedure. At the end of such period, the hearing officer shall notify the parties that\nthe shortened procedure will or will not be used. (d) Within 10 days after receipt of notice\nthat the shortened procedure will be used, the department shall submit to the\nhearing officer, in triplicate, in support of the charges contained in the\nnotice of hearing, an opening statement of the facts. A copy of such document\nshall be served by the department on the respondent. (e) Within 10 days after receipt of the\ndepartment's opening statement, the respondent shall submit to the hearing\nofficer, in triplicate, in support of his answer, an answering statement of\nfacts. (f) Within 10 days after\nreceipt of a copy of the respondent's answering statement, the department may\nsubmit to the hearing officer, in triplicate, a statement in reply, which shall\nbe confined strictly to replying to the facts and arguments set forth in the\nanswering statement. (g) As used in\nthis section, the term \"statement\" includes (1) statements of fact signed and\nsworn to by persons having knowledge of those facts; (2) documents submitted as\nproof of the alleged facts, if any, which documents shall be properly\nidentified by verified statements in the statement submitted or otherwise\nauthenticated in such a manner that they would be admissible in evidence at a\nhearing under the rules in this Part; and, (3) briefs containing argument to\nsustain the contentions of the party submitting the statement. When\npracticable, the documents which constitute the record of any transaction in\ndispute should be made a part of the statement. (h) Any facts stated in the statement must be\nsworn to before a person authorized to administer oaths by a person who states\nin the affidavit that he has actual knowledge of the facts. Except under\nunusual circumstances, which shall be set forth in the statement and affidavit, any such person shall be one who would appear as a witness if an oral hearing\nwere held. (i) The original of each\ndocument must show the signature, capacity, and impression seal or notarial\nstamp of the officer administering the oath and the date thereof. Copies must\nbear a notation that the original shows the data required in this\nrespect. (j) In addition to, or in\nlieu of, statements herein provided for, the parties may submit to the hearing\nofficer stipulations of fact signed by the parties or their representatives. Such stipulations shall become a part of the record. The stipulation must be\nsubmitted to the hearing officer within 10 days after notice that the shortened\nprocedure will be used; or, if the department's opening statement is filed, within 10 days after the submission of such statement; or, if an answering\nstatement is submitted, within 15 days after the submission thereof; or, if a\nstatement in reply is submitted, within 15 days after the submission\nthereof. (k) The hearing officer\nmay, in his discretion, grant an extension of time in respect to the submission\nof statements and stipulations. (l) Failure to submit, within the time prescribed, any statement required or\nauthorized under this section shall constitute a waiver of the right to submit\nsuch statement or stipulation. In such case, the hearing officer may prepare\nhis report, findings of fact and recommendations and the commissioner may make\nthe final determination and order upon the evidence contained in the record at\nthe time of such failure to submit and file, except that no determination, other than dismissal of the proceeding without prejudice, shall be made if the\ndepartment fails to submit an opening statement of the facts. (m) Except as otherwise may be directed by\nthe hearing officer, the submission of the department's statement in reply, or\nif the department has not submitted a reply, the submission of the respondent's\nanswering statement, shall conclude the presentation of evidence. The hearing\nofficer shall thereupon submit his report, findings of fact and\nrecommendations, and the same procedure shall be followed thereafter as in\nproceedings where an oral hearing has been held.
