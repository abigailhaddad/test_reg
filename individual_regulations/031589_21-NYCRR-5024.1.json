  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 5024.1 - Implementation of accelerated death benefit\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis Part implements subdivision 9 of section\n511\nof the\n\nEducation Law added by chapter 616 of the Laws of 1998. That provision enables\ncertain members who are eligible to be retired for disability (disregarding any\nservice requirement) to receive, while still living, the death benefit that\nwould have been paid pursuant to Education Law, section 512 or Retirement and\n\nSocial Security Law, sections 448, 508 or 606, as applicable, had the member\ndied on the member's last day on the payroll in full pay status. In other\nwords, the applicable death benefit is not paid after the member's death but is\naccelerated and paid during the member's lifetime. The accelerated death\nbenefit provided pursuant to the provision is expressly in lieu of any\ndisability retirement benefit, including any optional survivor benefit, to\nwhich the member would otherwise have been entitled. The member, however, is\notherwise treated as having been retired for disability. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n5024.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
