Such\nprocedures shall meet the following requirements: (1)\n\nHazard classifications. The rail fixed\nguideway systems shall adopt a hazard classification system that categorizes\nhazards by severity and frequency consistent with the hazard resolution matrix\ncontained in 49 CFR part\n659.

Rail fixed guideway systems are encouraged to\nuse plain language definitions to the extent possible in this\nrequirement. (2)\n\nHazard reporting. As part of its annual review of the rail fixed guideway system's annual audit\nplan in accordance with section\n990.17\n(b) of this\n\nPart or at such other times as potential safety hazards may be identified the\n\nSafety Board or its staff may request special reporting of hazardous conditions\nand the system's proposed strategy for their resolution or disposition. The\nform, frequency and duration of such reports shall be prescribed as appropriate\nfor the situation. (b) Hazard investigation. Safety Board staff may conduct investigations of reported\nhazardous conditions, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, following established Safety Board procedures for accident investigations, as\nset forth in section\n990.11\nof this Part. The results\nof such staff investigations and recommendations with regards to concurrence or\nmodification of proposed hazard resolution strategies will be presented to the\n\nSafety Board at the earliest, regularly scheduled Safety Board meeting\npracticable.
