  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6654.12 - OAA legal assistance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each area agency shall use an adequate\nportion of its OAA-supportive services funding for a program of legal\nassistance including advice and representation to elderly people with economic\nor social need. Legal assistance means legal advice and judicial or\nadministrative representation by an attorney including, to the extent feasible, counseling or other appropriate assistance by a paralegal or law student under\nthe direct supervision of an attorney. Legal assistance also includes\ncounseling or representation by a nonlawyer where permitted by law, to elderly\npeople with economic or social need. OAA legal assistance must be in addition\nto any other legal services already being provided to elderly people in the\narea. (b) Each area agency shall\ndevelop and assure the coordination of a system of access to legal assistance\nfor elderly in the area which encourages the participation of all segments of\nthe legal provider community. If the area agency does not contract with a legal\nservices corporation grantee, it will coordinate its services with existing\nlegal services corporation projects in the area agency, in order to assure that\nthe elderly receive a proportional share of representation from the legal\nservices corporation grantee, to avoid under this Title on individuals with the\ngreatest social and economic need. (c) Each legal assistance provider shall make\nefforts, in coordination with the area agency, to involve the private bar in\nlegal assistance for the elderly, including the establishment of groups within\nthe private bar which will furnish legal assistance to elderly people on a pro\nbono or reduced-fee basis. The legal assistance provider and the area agency\nwill develop a system of assisted referrals of cases to the private bar, including appropriate follow-up to assure that services have been\nprovided. (d) Each area agency must\naward funds to the legal assistance provider or providers that most fully meet\nthe standards of this subdivision. The legal assistance provider or providers\nmust: (1)\nhave staff with expertise in\nspecific areas of law affecting elderly people in economic or social need (for\nexample, public benefits, institutionalization, and alternatives to\ninstitutionalization); (2)\ndemonstrate the capacity to provide effective administration and judicial\nrepresentation in the areas of law affecting elderly people with economic or\nsocial need; (3)\ndemonstrate the\ncapacity to provide support to other advocacy efforts (for example, the\nlong-term care ombudsman program); (4)\ndemonstrate the capacity to deliver legal\nservices to institutionalized, isolated and homebound elderly individuals\neffectively; and\n(5)\ndemonstrate\nthe capacity to provide legal assistance in the principal language spoken by\nclients in areas where a significant number of clients do not speak English as\ntheir principle language. (e) Each legal assistance provider, in\nconsultation with the area agency, may set priorities for service delivery\nwhich allocate program resources in areas which will concentrate service on the\nelderly least able to obtain legal assistance elsewhere. In setting case\npriorities, the area agency and service provider: (1)\nmay take into account the availability of\nstaff resources in determining the extent of legal advice and representation to\nprovide individual elderly people; but\n(2)\nmay not consider the priorities as\neligibility criteria, but shall evaluate whether representation is appropriate\nin a particular case because of the benefits to the elderly individual or\nelderly in general, and the availability of adequate representation from other\nsources. (f) In setting\ncase priorities, criminal cases may not be defended, and representation in\nfee-generating cases except where private bar representation is otherwise\nunavailable is also prohibited. Filing conservatorships is prohibited except\nwhere an elderly person requests the filing of a voluntary petition or in the\ncase of an involuntary petition against a close relative such as a spouse; and\nwhere no other agency can be persuaded to bring the petition and where bringing\nsuch a petition is not inconsistent with the interest of the elderly\nconservatee. (1)\n\nCase priorities must be\ndetermined so as not to duplicate services available from other sources, i.e., the private bar and legal services corporation grantee, and to fill existing\ngaps in the availability of services to the elderly with the greatest\nneed. (g) Other provider\nresponsibilities. (1)\n\nThe legal assistance\nprovider shall assist the area agency with other advocacy efforts, and shall\nassist the long-term care ombudsman program. (2)\n\nThe legal assistance provider may not\nserve as house counsel to the area agency. (3)\n\nThe legal assistance provider shall\nprovide training to area agency staff and, where appropriate, to community\ngroups and members of the private bar. Training is reimbursable as training\ncosts when provided by legal assistance providers. Outreach activities by the\narea agency and the legal assistance providers are reimbursable, and the legal\nassistance providers may be reimbursed for recruiting members of the private\nbar to conduct training, make group presentations and accept\nreferrals. (h) An OAA\nlegal assistance provider may not require an elderly person to disclose\ninformation about income or resources as a condition for providing legal\nassistance. An OAA legal assistance provider may ask about an elderly person's\nfinancial circumstances as a part of the process of providing legal advice, counseling and representation, or for the purpose of identifying additional\nresources and benefits for which an elderly person may be eligible. (i) Nothing in this section is intended to\nprohibit an attorney or staff attorney from providing any form of legal\nassistance to an eligible client, or to interfere with the fulfillment of any\nattorney's professional responsibilities to a client. When providing OAA legal\nassistance: (1)\n\nEach legal assistance\nprovider and its attorneys and employees must comply with the following\nregulations when engaged in the outside practice of law: (i) no attorney shall engage in any outside\npractice of law if the director of the provider has determined that such\npractice is inconsistent with the attorney's full-time\nresponsibilities; (ii)\nif the\nrequirement of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph is met, a provider may permit\nan attorney to engage in compensated outside practice of law when the attorney\nis newly employed and has a professional responsibility to close cases from a\nprevious law practice, and does so as expeditiously as possible; (iii)\nif the requirement of subparagraph (i)\nof this paragraph is met, a provider may permit an attorney to engage in\ncompensated outside practice of law when the attorney is acting pursuant to an\nappointment made under a court rule or practice of equal applicability to all\nattorneys in the jurisdiction, and remits to the provider all compensation\nreceived; or\n(iv)\nif the\nrequirement of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph is met, a provider may permit\nan attorney to engage in uncompensated outside practice of law when the\nattorney is acting pursuant to an appointment made under a court rule or\npractice of equal applicability to all attorneys in the jurisdiction or on\nbehalf of a close friend, family member, religious community, or charitable\ngroup.
