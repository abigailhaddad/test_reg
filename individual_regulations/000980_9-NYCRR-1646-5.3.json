  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-5.3 - Contract changes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A contract\nchange generally involves an adjustment in the contract price, or an extension\nof time, or both. Changes in contracts are accomplished by the issuance of an\norder in writing by the authorized person designated by the local agency to\nadminister the contracts. Orders for contract changes shall never be issued\nverbally. Orders to change contracts are classified as follows: (1)\n\nChange orders. Change orders authorize a\nvariation in the contract terms. The change order must state whether there is\nto be an adjustment of the contract price, and the exact amount of such\nadjustment, if any. (2)\n\nProceed\norders. Proceed orders authorize a variation in the contract terms without\nstating a definite price, said price being subject to future determination. A\nproceed order must be superseded by a change order as soon as the definite\nprice is determined. (b) The prior written approval of the division is required for any change in the\ncontract amount in excess of a \"maximum sum\". Such \"maximum sum\" may be\nstipulated either in the loan contract or in the individual construction\ncontracts. (c) All contract changes\nshall be recorded in the contractors ledger. (d) Where the contract change involves a\nchange in the contract amount, a journal entry, supported by the letter of the\ndivision approving the change or by the approved change order shall be made\nadjusting the amounts previously recorded in account 1500, Incompleted\n\nContracts, and account 2400, Contract Awards. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1646-5.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
