(c) If\nproperty acquired in the purchase of an operating unit or system is in such\nphysical condition when acquired that it is necessary substantially to\nrehabilitate it in order to bring the property up to the standards of the\nutility, the cost of such work, except replacements, shall be accounted for as\npart of the purchase price of the property. (d) When any property acquired as an\noperating unit or system includes duplicate or other plant which will be\nretired by the accounting utility in the reconstruction of the acquired\nproperty or its consolidation with previously owned property, the proposed\naccounting for such property shall be presented to the commission. (e) In connection with the acquisition of\nwater plant constituting an operating unit or system, the utility shall\nprocure, if possible, all existing records relating to the property acquired, or certified copies thereof, and shall preserve such records in conformity with\nregulations or practices governing the preservation of records of its own\nconstruction. (f) When water plant\nconstituting an operating unit or system is sold, conveyed or transferred to\nanother by sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, the book cost of the\nproperty sold or transferred to another shall be credited to the appropriate\nutility plant accounts, including amounts carried in account 114, Water Plant\n\nAcquisition Adjustments, and the amounts (estimated if not known) carried with\nrespect thereto in the accounts for accumulated provisions for depreciation and\namortization and in account 252, Customer Advances for Construction, shall be\ncharged to such accounts and the contra entries made to account 102, Water\n\nPlant Purchased or Sold.

Tit. 16\n§\n563.5\n\nIn cases where existing utilities merge or consolidate\nbecause of financial or operating reasons or statutory requirements rather than\nas a means of transferring title or purchased properties to a new owner, the\naccounts of the constituent utilities, with the approval of the commission, may\nbe combined. In the event original cost has not been determined, the resulting\nutility shall proceed to determine such cost as outlined\nherein. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
