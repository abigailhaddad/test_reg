  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 r. 202.70.34 - Staggered Court Appearances\n\nState Regulations\n\nStaggered court appearances are a\nmechanism to increase efficiency in the courts and to decrease lawyers' time\nwaiting for a matter to be called by the courts. While this rule is intended to\nstreamline the litigation process in the Commercial Division, it will be\nineffectual without the cooperation and participation of litigants. Improving\nthe process of litigating in the Commercial Division by instituting staggered\ncourt appearances of matters before the court, for example, requires not only\nthe promulgation of rules such as this one, but also, and more importantly, the\nproactive and earnest adherence to such rules by parties and their\ncounsel. (a) Each court\nappearance before a Commercial Division Justice for oral argument on a motion\nshall be assigned a time slot. The length of the time slot allotted to each\nmatter is solely in the discretion of the court. (b) In order for the court to\nbe able to address any and all matters of concern to the court and in order for\nthe court to avoid the appearance of holding ex parte communications with one\nor more parties in the case, even those parties who believe that they are not\ndirectly involved in the matter before the court must appear at the appointed\ndate and time assigned by the court unless specifically excused by the court. However, if an individual is appearing as a self-represented person, that\nindividual must appear at each and every scheduled court appearance regardless\nof whether he or she anticipates being heard. (c) Since the court is setting aside a\nspecific time slot for the case to be heard and since there are occasions when\nthe court's electronic or other notification system fails or occasions when a\nparty fails to receive the court-generated notification, each attorney who\nreceives notification of an appearance on a specific date and time is\nresponsible for notifying all other parties by e-mail that the matter is\nscheduled to be heard on that assigned date and time. All parties are directed\nto exchange e-mail addresses with each other at the commencement of the case\nand to keep these e-mail addresses current, in order to facilitate notification\nby the person(s) receiving the court notification. (d) Requests for adjournments\nor to appear telephonically must be e-filed and received in writing by the\ncourt by no later than 48 hours before the hearing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\nr. 202.70.34. Adopted, New\n\nYork State Register September 3, 2014/Volume XXXVI, Issue 35, eff. 9/2/2014\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
