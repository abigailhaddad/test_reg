Tit. 10 §§ 70-2.4 - Transfer of regulated medical waste for off-site treatment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Generators of regulated medical waste shall transfer such waste for off-site treatment only to a regulated medical waste transporter permitted by the Department of Environmental Conservation; provided, however, that a generator of under 50 pounds of regulated medical waste per month registered with the Department of Environmental Conservation pursuant to 6 NYCRR Part\n364\nmay transport its own waste for off-site treatment. (b) A facility that generates waste and arranges transport for off-site treatment or disposal, or otherwise participates in the transport of regulated medical waste shall ensure that a regulated medical waste tracking form prescribed by the Department of Environmental Conservation accompanies each load. (c) All solid waste transported in a load containing regulated medical waste shall be treated as regulated medical waste, unless the regulated medical waste is separately contained in a secondary container meeting the requirements of section\n70-2.2\n(h) of this Subpart or is otherwise kept separate from the solid waste by leak-proof barriers.
