Tit. 6 § 199.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen used in this Part: (a) Approved management plan means a plan\napproved by the department for the management of an eligible tract which will\nensure the continuing production of a merchantable forest crop selected by the\nowner. Every approved management plan must meet the standards and requirements\nof section\n199.6\nof this Part. Such plan must\nbe prepared by or under the direct supervision of a forester who may be the\nowner or an agent of the owner, including an industrial forester or a\ncooperating consultant forester. (b) Assessor means an elected or appointed\nofficer or body of officers charged by law with the duty of assessing real\nproperty for the purposes of taxation or special ad valorem levies, for county, city, town, village, school district or special district purposes. (c) Basal area means the total cross\nsectional area of all live tree stems expressed as square feet per acre and\nmeasured at a point 4 1/2feet above the ground. (d) Certificate of approval means the\ndocument issued by the department evidencing that the tract is an eligible\ntract for purposes of the real property tax exemption authorized by section\n480-a\nof the Real Property Tax Law (RPTL). (e) Commercial harvest cutting means the\nremoval of a forest crop from an eligible tract of forest land for which the\nowner receives economic value either from a sale or through utilization. Commercial harvest cutting shall not include up to 10 standard cords which may\nbe cut annually for the owner's own use in accordance with sound forestry\npractices, or noncommercial cuttings prescribed in the approved management\nplan. (f) Commitment means a\ndeclaration to the department and the assessor, made on an annual basis by the\nowner of a certified eligible tract, in writing, on forms provided by the\ndepartment, committing such tract to continued forest crop production for the\nnext succeeding 10 years under the approved management plan. (g) Compatible or supportive use means any\nuse of an eligible tract which is desired by the owner and compatible with or\nsupportive of the continuing production of a merchantable forest crop. A use\nwill be considered to be compatible or supportive unless it precludes forest\ncrop production, involves permanent physical construction, or materially alters\nforest land with significant adverse impact upon the condition of forest crops. Compatible or supportive uses will be permissible but not mandatory components\nof approved management plans. The inclusion of a compatible or supportive use\nin an approved management plan does not represent the owner's undertaking to\nperform the use and does not imply that other compatible or supportive uses may\nnot be undertaken on the eligible tract. (h) Contiguous acres shall refer to an\neligible tract where forest lands are adjacent or near each other. These may be\ndivided by nonforest land owned and controlled by the owner, or Federal, State, county or town roads, easements, rights-of-way, energy transmission corridors, or similar facilities, as long as vehicular access necessary for forest\nmanagement purposes is not precluded. (i) Cooperating consultant forester means a\nforester who, or a forestry consultant firm which, has entered into an\nagreement with the department under the New York State cooperating consultant\nforesters program pursuant to section\n9-0713\nof the Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw. (j) Department means the\n\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation. (k) Diameter at breast height (DBH) means the\ndiameter of a tree measured 4 1/2 feet from the ground. (l) Diameter class means one of the following\nclassifications of the stand: (1)\n\nSeedling--sapling (SS)--the majority of dominant and codominant trees are less\nthan 5.5 inches DBH. (2)\n\nPole\ntimber (PT)--the majority of dominant and codominant trees are between 5.6\ninches and 11.5 inches DBH. (3)\n\nSaw\ntimber (ST)--the majority of dominant and codominant trees are 11.6 inches DBH\nor larger. (m) Eligible\ntract means a tract of privately owned forest land of at least 50 contiguous\nacres, exclusive of any portion thereof not devoted to the production of\nmerchantable forest crops, which has a certificate of approval issued by the\ndepartment. No otherwise eligible tract, or portion thereof, shall be deemed to\nbe ineligible solely on the ground that any general or special State law, or\nrule or regulation adopted thereunder, partially restricts or requires further\napproval for forest crop production practices or activities on such tract or\nportion. (n) Endangered and\nthreatened species means those species of fish, shellfish, crustacea, wildlife\nand plants designated or listed as endangered species or threatened species\nunder orders, rules or regulations issued by the department pursuant to section\n11-0535\nor section\n9-1503\nof the Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw. (o) Forester means an\nindividual who has graduated from a school of forestry recognized by the\n\nSociety of American Foresters, or who possesses qualifications for the practice\nof forestry essentially equivalent to those possessed by a graduate of a school\nof forestry in a curriculum of forest management recognized by the Society of\n\nAmerican Foresters. (p) Forest land\nmeans land primarily devoted to and suitable for forest crop production under\naccepted evenaged or unevenaged forest management systems through natural\nregeneration or through forestation and sufficiently stocked with forest trees\nto produce a merchantable forest crop within 30 years of time of original\ncertification. Forest land shall consist of a stand or stands of commercial\nspecies of forest trees which contain at least either 500 stems per acre or 60\nsquare feet of basal area per acre which shall be evenly distributed over the\narea of the stand. The department may approve a smaller number of planted trees\nper acre if the resulting spacing between trees is appropriate for satisfactory\ngrowth for the species being planted. For natural seedlings to be part of a\nstand, they must be at least one foot in height, and planted trees must be at\nleast in their third growing season on the site. (q) Forest management area means a specific\narea of forest land to be managed under the approved management plan. A forest\nmanagement area may be a planned sale area, anticipated commercial harvest\ncutting unit, or other defined operational area in which one or more stands, or\nportions of stands, will be managed collectively. A forest management area may\ncontain any number of forest types, species, diameter classes, or site classes. Management systems and cutting prescriptions within a forest management area\nmay be generic to all stands of the same forest type. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, however, within every forest management area, stand prescriptions\nbased upon individual stands shall be provided to the department pursuant to\nsection\n199.6\n(b) of this\n\nPart.

(u) Owner means the person or persons having\nlegal title to the eligible tract.

(w) Site class\nmeans the classification of the stand in terms of the inherent capacity to grow\ncrops for commercial harvest cuttings. (x) Stand means an aggregation of trees or\nother growth occupying a specific area and sufficiently uniform in species\ncomposition, arrangement or condition so as to be distinguishable from adjacent\nareas. Every stand shall be forest land, as defined in this section. (y) Stand prescription means the stand\nanalysis documents specifying all of the work necessary to accomplish the\nmanagement system in a stand and will be based upon an onsite inspection of the\nstand by a forester. (z) Stumpage\nvalue means the current fair market value of a merchantable forest crop as it\nstands prior to the time of sale, cutting, required cutting or removal. Stumpage value shall be determined by the department through one or more of the\nfollowing methods: the sale price of the crop in an arm's-length sale, a review\nof solicited bids, the stumpage price report prepared by the department, comparison with like sales on State forests or private lands, or other\nappropriate means to assure that a fair market value is established within an\nacceptable range based on the appropriate geographic area. (aa)\n\nType means the classification of the\nstand according to generally accepted forest procedures. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
