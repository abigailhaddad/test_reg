  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 84.3 - Statement of policy\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept as provided herein, the Banking Board has determined\nnot to reinstate specific loan limits for improved or unimproved real estate\nper se or lending limits relating to locational requirements (except to the\nextent that the same continue to be provided for in the Banking Law). At the\nsame time, the board expects lenders to make and purchase mortgage loans under\nspecific internal guidelines which are consistent with safe and sound banking\npractices. Such guidelines shall, among other things, contain provisions which\nensure that the lender will meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods and establish limits\non: (a) credit concentrations to any\nsingle mortgagor (including affiliates); (b) credit concentrations by loan type and\nlocation; and\n(c) loan-to-appraisal\nratios. These guidelines shall be available to the superintendent to\nreview in the course of any examination or investigation which he may\nundertake. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n84.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
