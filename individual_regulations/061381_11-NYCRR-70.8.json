  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 70.8 - Physicians medical malpractice liability insurance rates for claims-made and occurrence primary and excess policies and claims-made tail coverage\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pending enactment of chapter 266 of the Laws of 1986, which was signed into law on July 8, 1986, all physicians medical malpractice liability insurers were directed by the\n\nFifth\n\nAmendment to Part 70 of this Title (section\n70.8\nrepealed by the eighth amendment of this Part) that the rates for the policy period commencing July 1, 1986 and ending June 30, 1987 would continue to be, on a provisional basis, the rates last approved by the department for said insurers. All insurers that issued policies of medical malpractice liability insurance, as defined in section\n70.1\n(a) of this Part, and all insurers with special licenses under section\n6302\nof the Insurance Law that issued policies including such coverage were directed to furnish their insureds with the following endorsement in connection with all such policies in effect on and after July 1, 1986: \"THE PREMIUMS ON THIS POLICY FOR THE PERIOD OF COVERAGE COMMENCING ON OR AFTER JULY 1, 1986 THROUGH JUNE 30, 1987 ARE PROVISIONAL AND ARE SUBJECT TO UPWARD OR DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT. INSUREDS MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY AN AMENDED PREMIUM RETROACTIVE TO JULY 1, 1986, OR THE ANNIVERSARY DATE OF THE POLICY, WHICHEVER IS LATER, OR BE ENTITLED TO A CREDIT IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MEET STATUTORY RATING STANDARDS.\"\n(b) Pursuant to section 40 of chapter 266 of the Laws of 1986, the superintendent was directed to establish rates for policies providing coverage for physicians medical malpractice liability insurance for the periods commencing July 1, 1985 and ending June 30, 1988. The rates established herein for policies issued or renewed during the year July 1, 1985 through June 30, 1986 supersede the provisional rates mandated by section\n70.5\nof this Part for primary coverage and by section\n70.6\nof this Part for excess coverage, and interim rate increases, if any, approved by the superintendent for such policy year, and the rates established by prior amendment of this section, where inconsistent with this amendment. The rates established herein for policies issued or renewed during the year July 1, 1986 through June 30, 1987 supersede the rates established by prior amendment of this section, where inconsistent with this amendment. Insurers shall charge a rate for physicians medical malpractice liability insurance only as established by the superintendent. (c) Base year occurrence rates. (1)\n\nFor the purposes of this Part, the base year occurrence rate shall be the occurrence rate approved for the insurer by the superintendent for policies issued or renewed during the year July 1, 1984 through June 30, 1985, as reduced by the 15-percent downward modification mandated by section\n70.5\n(c)(1)\nof this Part. (2)\n\nFor any insurer that had no base year occurrence rate as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, but had a claims-made rate approved, the base year occurrence rate shall be the third year claims-made rate approved by the superintendent, as reduced by the 15-percent downward modification mandated by section\n70.5\n(c)(1)\nof this Part, multiplied by 1.158. (3)\n\nFor any insurer that utilized a rate which has not been approved by the superintendent, and for any insurer that has not previously written policies subject to this Part, the base year occurrence rate shall be the approved rate of another insurer, that is most appropriate for that insurer, together with any modification which can be adequately supported. Such rate shall not be used until established by the superintendent. (d) Rating plans. (1)\n\nFor any insurer that utilized a rating plan which has not been approved by the superintendent, and for any insurer that has not previously written policies subject to this Part, the rating plan shall be the approved rating plan of another insurer that is most appropriate for that insurer, together with any modification which can be adequately supported. Such plan may not be used until it is approved by the superintendent. (e) Occurrence primary and excess coverage rates. (1)\n\nRates for occurrence policies issued or renewed during the year July 1, 1985 through June 30, 1986: (i) For primary coverage, up to $1 million/$3 million, the rate shall be 14 percent greater than the base year occurrence rate. (ii)\n\nFor a first excess layer providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above $1 million/$3 million primary coverage the rate shall be 30 percent of the $1 million/$3 million rate for primary coverage established in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (iii)\n\nFor a second excess layer providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above the underlying primary coverage and first layer of excess coverage described in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, the rate shall be 20 percent of the $1 million/$3 million rate for primary coverage established in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (2)\n\nRates for occurrence policies issued or renewed during the year July 1, 1986 through June 30, 1987: (i) For primary coverage, up to $1 million/$3 million, the rate shall be nine percent greater than that established pursuant to subparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nFor a first excess layer providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above $1 million/$3 million primary coverage, the rate shall be 35 percent of the $1 million/$3 million rate for primary coverage established in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (iii)\n\nFor a second excess layer providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above the underlying primary coverage and first layer of excess coverage, described in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, the rate shall be 24 percent of the $1 million/$3 million rate for primary coverage established in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (3)\n\nRates for occurrence policies issued or renewed during the year July 1, 1987 through June 30, 1988: (i) For primary coverage, up to $1 million/$3 million, the rate shall be nine percent greater than that established pursuant to subparagraph (2)(i) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nFor a first excess layer providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above $1 million/$3 million primary coverage, the rate shall be 40 percent of the $1 million/$3 million rate for primary coverage established in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (iii)\n\nFor a second excess layer providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above the underlying primary coverage and first layer of excess coverage, described in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, the rate shall be 28 percent of the $1 million/$3 million rate for primary coverage established in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (4)\n\nThe rates for the excess layers apply to policies purchased directly by physicians and to policies purchased by general hospitals on behalf of their eligible physicians, as required by section 19 of chapter 294 of the Laws of 1985 and by section 18 of chapter 269 of the Laws of 1986. (5)\n\nThe rates for occurrence excess layer policies providing coverage other than as specifically established herein shall be established by the superintendent after a review of proposed rates and supporting documentation to be submitted by each insurer writing such coverage, in accordance with paragraph (j)(3) of this section. The superintendent shall consider such submissions, as well as any other relevant factors, and will thereafter establish a rate for each such excess layer. (f) Claims-made primary and excess coverage rates. (1)\n\nClaims-made primary coverage rates. The claims-made rate for a particular primary coverage policy shall be the corresponding occurrence rate multiplied by the appropriate claims-made factor, as follows: Year in claims-made program\n\nClaims-made factor\n\nFirst: 31%\nSecond: 64\n\nThird: 85\n\nFourth: 94\n\nFifth: 99\n\nSixth: 102\n(2)\n\nOptional extended reporting period (tail) primary coverage rates. (i) The rate for optional tail coverage that is required to be offered for a particular claims-made primary coverage policy shall be the corresponding occurrence rate multiplied by the appropriate tail factor, as follows: Number of years completed in claims-made program\n\nTail factor\n\nOne: 74.8%\nTwo: 122.1\n\nThree: 146.4\n\nFour: 162.4\n\nFive: 173.3\n\nSix: 181.0\n(ii)\n\nFor a policy terminated on a date other than the policy anniversary date, the tail factor shall be obtained by interpolating, on a daily basis, between the tail factors applicable to the last and next policy anniversaries. (iii)\n\nFor any policy that was written at a reduced rate because the insured was eligible for a new doctor discount, the tail premium shall be reduced by a percentage equal to the percentage that the current year's rate (exclusive of any surplus contributions) was reduced as a result of such new doctor discount. (3)\n\nRates for claims-made and tail excess coverage policies purchased by hospitals. The aggregate rate for a claims-made excess coverage policy and its simultaneously issued tail (as mandated by subdivision [g] of this section) purchased by a general hospital on behalf of a physician, shall be equal to the corresponding occurrence excess coverage rate. (4)\n\nRates for claims-made and tail excess coverage policies purchased by physicians directly. The rates for the claims-made and tail first and second excess layers required to be offered when purchased directly by a physician, and the rates for any other claims-made and tail excess layer other than as specified herein, shall be established by the superintendent after a review of proposed rates and supporting documents to be submitted by each insurer writing, or required to write, such coverage, in accordance with paragraph (j)(3) of this section. The superintendent shall consider such submissions, as well as any other relevant factors, and will thereafter establish a rate for each such excess layer. (g) Excess coverage-types of policies; required tail. (1)\n\nPursuant to section 19 of chapter 294 of the Laws of 1985, and as established in section\n70.7\n(c) of this Part, excess coverage policies providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above $1 million/$3 million primary coverage, purchased by general hospitals on behalf of physicians, afforded such coverage for \"occurrences\" between July 1, 1985 through June 30, 1986 and were issued on an \"occurrence\" basis. (2)\n\nPursuant to section 18 of chapter 266 of the Laws of 1986, excess coverage policies providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above $1 million/$3 million primary coverage, purchased by general hospitals on behalf of physicians, shall provide such coverage for \"occurrences\" between July 1, 1986 and June 30, 1987. Accordingly, all physicians medical malpractice liability insurers which issue such an excess policy on a claims-made basis shall simultaneously issue full tail coverage. (3)\n\nExcept where required to be issued on a claims-made basis pursuant to section 5504(f), excess coverage policies issued or renewed on and after July 1, 1986 shall provide coverage on either an occurrence or claims-made basis, subject to paragraph (2) of this subdivision, provided that: (i) An excess coverage policy shall be renewed on the same basis (occurrence or claims- made) as it was previously issued, except that the insured may choose to substitute claims- made coverage for occurrence coverage. (ii)\n\nIf the insured so requests, an excess coverage policy issued by the same insurer that issued the underlying primary coverage shall be issued with the same type of coverage (occurrence or claims-made) as the primary coverage. (4)\n\nThe provisions of section\n70.7\n(b)(2) and (d)\nof this Part continue to be applicable to all medical malpractice liability insurers. (h) Segregated accounts and surcharge accounts.

(iii)\n\nIf the insured had coverage with a policy inception or renewal date on or after July 1, 1985, and on or before June 30, 1999, only with insurers not entitled to a surcharge in accordance with section\n70.22\n(c) of this Part, no surcharge shall be collected from that insured.
