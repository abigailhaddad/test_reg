Whenever the department concludes that civil penalties may be\nwarranted, it may seek to impose a civil penalty of up to $5,000 for each\nviolation. (1)\n\nFactors to be considered in\ndetermining whether to impose a civil penalty may include, but need not be\nlimited to: (i) the nature of the violation\nand of any injury resulting therefrom; (ii)\nthe degree of danger to the public\ncaused by the unauthorized conduct; (iii)\nwhether the unauthorized conduct was\ninadvertent, or was committed with knowledge that the conduct was\nunauthorized; (iv)\nthe duration and\nfrequency of the unauthorized conduct; (v) any past history or findings of\nunauthorized practice by the respondent; and\n(vi)\nrespondent's failure to comply with any\ncease and desist order previously issued. (2)\n\nIn the event that respondent violates a\ncease and desist order during the course of a hearing or appeal, the department\nmay deem such violation to constitute sufficient cause upon which to seek a\ncivil penalty under this section. (b) Restitution. Respondent may be ordered to\nmake restitution to any person who has an interest in any money or property, either real or personal, acquired by the respondent as a result of the\nunauthorized practice of a profession or the unauthorized use of a professional\ntitle. (1)\n\nFactors the department may\nconsider in determining whether to order restitution include, but need not be\nlimited to: (i) the nature of the violation\nand of any injury resulting therefrom; (ii)\nthe degree of danger to the public\ncaused by the unauthorized conduct; (iii)\nwhether the unauthorized conduct was\ninadvertent or was committed with knowledge that the conduct was\nunauthorized; (iv)\nthe duration and\nfrequency of the unauthorized conduct; (v) any past history or findings of\nunauthorized practice by respondent; (vi)\nrespondent's failure to comply with any\ncease and desist order previously issued; and\n(vii)\nwhether the loss suffered by the\nclaimant is sufficiently identifiable and quantifiable to enable an order of\nrestitution to be made. (2)\n\nClaim for restitution. Any person who\nseeks to make a claim for restitution based upon respondent's unauthorized\npractice or unauthorized use of a professional title shall submit a written\nclaim for restitution to the department, on a form prescribed by the\ncommissioner. The claim for restitution shall describe, with particularity, the\ncircumstances of the alleged unauthorized practice and/or unauthorized use of a\nprofessional title, and shall describe the specific money or property, either\nreal or personal, acquired by the respondent for which the claimant seeks\nrestitution.
