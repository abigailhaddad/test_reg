  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 395.3 - Persons in military service-eligibility of dependents\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Social services\ndistricts shall provide assistance and care to the dependents of persons in the\n\nArmed Forces on the basis of presumptive or established need. Assistance and\ncare shall be granted to such dependents for whose support members of the Armed\n\nForces are legally or socially responsible but for whom they are unwilling to\nallot portions of service pay or are unwilling and/or unable to make allotments\nin specified amounts in order to claim quarters allowances. Such assistance\nshall be granted only until needed support can be obtained from legally\nresponsible relatives in the Armed Forces and only for such amounts as are not\nprovided by such relatives' allotments. (1)\n\nApplicants for public assistance or care, who are the spouses and children of\nmembers of the Armed Forces, shall be referred to local chapters of the\n\nAmerican Red Cross for financial assistance pending the first receipt of\nallotments or allowances, or the first determination of the member's refusal to\nallot payments and claim quarters allowances for their support. (2)\n\nRecipients of public assistance and care, including the spouses and children of members of the Armed Forces, shall be\ngranted public assistance and care during the exploration of the service\nperson's intent in regard to allotments and pending the receipt of such\npayments. (3)\n\nPublic assistance and\ncare shall be granted when necessary to supplement allotments of service pay, or in lieu of such payments when the person in service refuses to make\nallotments of pay or claim quarters allowances for the support of his\ndependents. (4)\n\nIn applying the\nincome made available through allotments of service pay, the regular and\nspecial needs of the dependent for whom the member of the Armed Forces has\nallotted a specified amount in order to claim quarters allowances shall be met\nbefore any portion of this income is applied to the needs of other members of\nthe household. (b) In\ndetermining initial or continuing eligibility for public assistance and care, full utilization shall be made of correspondence and documents which the\ndependents of the service person are able to furnish in verification of the\nreceipt or nonreceipt of allotments-of-pay and quarters allowances or of the\nattitude of the service person in regard to such provision. (1)\n\nReferral of dependents shall be made when\nnecessary to agencies established to provide services to members of the Armed\n\nForces, veterans and their dependents for help in completing affidavits and\nother documents which may be required for the claiming of dependents allotments\nand allowances. (2)\n\nInformation in\nregard to the needs of dependents and the amount of public assistance or care\nwhich they are receiving shall be made available to such agencies in order to\nsubstantiate claims of dependency. (3)\n\nLocal social services departments shall\ncommunicate directly with the dependency divisions administering\nallotments-of-pay and quarters allowances, or with commanding officers, when\nnecessary to substantiate the claims of dependents or to validate the fact that\npublic assistance is required for their support. Such direct correspondence\nshall be initiated after review of the evidence of refusal to provide support\nthrough allotments of pay and/or after consultation of the agencies to whom\ndependents may have been referred for help in filing claims of\ndependency. (c) The\ndetermination of relationship made by the dependency divisions of the armed\nservices administering allotments-of-pay and quarters allowances may be\naccepted by social services districts but solely for the purpose of\nestablishing eligibility for categories of public assistance where marital\nstatus is a factor or where proof of relationship to the service person may be\nrequired, as in family assistance and veteran assistance. (1)\n\nThe acceptance of such determination for\nthe purpose of establishing eligibility for public assistance shall not be\nconstrued as an adjudication of other legal rights of the persons concerned in\nsuch applications. (2)\n\nThe\nacceptance of such adjudications shall not prevent review and reconsideration\nof particular situations on the basis on the submission of additional\ndata. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
