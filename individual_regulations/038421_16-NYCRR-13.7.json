(2)\nA utility shall offer an\nexisting customer, from whom a deposit is required under clauses (1)(ii)(a) or\n(b) of this subdivision, the opportunity to pay the deposit in three\ninstallments, 50 percent down and two monthly payments of the\nbalance. (3)\nA utility shall\nestablish a written procedure covering its deposit policy and\npractice. (4)\nA request for a\ndeposit or deposit increase shall be in writing and shall advise the customer: (i) why the deposit is being\nrequested; (ii)\nhow the amount of\nthe deposit was calculated; (iii)\nthat the deposit is subject to later upward or downward revision based on the\ncustomer's subsequent billing history; (iv)\nthat the customer may request that the\nutility review the account in order to assure that the deposit is not\nexcessive; (v) the circumstances\nunder which the deposit will be refunded; (vi)\nthat the customer will receive annual\nnotice of the interest credited to the account; (vii)\nabout the available deposit\nalternatives; and\n(viii)\nthat for\nan existing customer from whom the deposit is being requested because of\ndelinquency or financial condition, the deposit may be paid in three\ninstallments. (5)\nA\nutility shall issue, to every customer from whom a deposit is obtained, a\nreceipt showing the date, the account number, the amount received, the form of\nthe payment, and shall contain a notice explaining the manner in which interest\nwill accrue and be paid and that the receipt is neither negotiable nor\ntransferable. (b) Deposit calculation. (1)\n\nThe amount of a\ndeposit shall not exceed the cost of twice the customer's average monthly\nusage, except in the case of customers whose usage varies widely such as\nspace-heating or -cooling customers, or certain manufacturing and industrial\nprocessors, where the deposit shall not exceed the cost of twice the average\nmonthly usage for the peak season. (2)\n\nIn the case of an existing customer who\nhas 12 months or more of billing history, the amount of the deposit shall be\nbased on service used during the previous 12-month period as evidenced by the\nbilling history. (3)\n\nIn the case of\na new customer or a customer with less than 12 months of billing history, the\namount of the deposit shall be based on one or more of the following, as\navailable: (i) the billing history of the\ncustomer; (ii)\ninformation provided\nin the application by the customer about the expected load and use of\nservice; (iii)\ninformation\ncontained in a load study of the premises prepared by the utility; and\n(iv)\nthe billing history of the\nprevious customer, provided there have been no significant changes in the\nload. (c) Deposit review. (1)\nA utility shall, at the\nfirst anniversary of the receipt of the deposit and at least biennially\nthereafter, review the billing history of every customer who has a deposit with\nthe utility, to assure that the amount of the deposit conforms to the\nlimitations contained in subdivision (b) of this section. This requirement does\nnot limit the right of a utility to review a deposit at any time. (i) If a deposit review shows that the\ndeposit held falls short of the amount that the utility may lawfully require by\n25 percent or more, the utility may require the payment of a corresponding\nadditional deposit amount from the customer. (ii)\n\nIf a deposit review shows that the\ndeposit held exceeds the amount that the utility may lawfully require by 25\npercent or more, the utility shall refund the excess deposit to the customer in\naccordance with subdivision (f) of this section. (2)\n\nUpon request of a customer for a downward\nrevision of the deposit, which request is substantiated both by the customer's\nbilling history and by a permanent documented change in load and consumption, a\nutility shall refund any portion of the deposit in excess of the amount the\nutility may lawfully require in accordance with subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (d) Deposit\nalternatives. (1)\nA utility shall accept\ndeposit alternatives which provide a level of security equivalent to cash, such\nas irrevocable bank letters of credit and surety bonds. (2)\nA utility may, at its discretion, accept\nfrom the customer, in lieu of a deposit, a written promise to pay bills on\nreceipt and a written waiver of the customer's right to be sent a final\ntermination notice until 20 calendar days after payment is due. (e) Interest. (1)\n\nEvery cash deposit shall accrue interest\nat a rate prescribed at least annually by the commission in light of the\ncurrent economic conditions and current charges paid for money borrowed by such\nutility, taking into account the expenses incurred by such utility in\nobtaining, handling, returning or crediting the sum deposited. (2)\n\nInterest shall be paid to the customer\nupon the return of the deposit, or, where the deposit has been held for a\nperiod of one year or more, the interest shall be credited to the customer no\nlater than the first bill rendered after the next succeeding first day of\n\nOctober and at the expiration of each succeeding one-year period. (3)\n\nInterest shall be calculated on the\ndeposit until the day it is applied as a credit to an account or the day on\nwhich a refund check is issued. If the deposit is credited in part and refunded\nin part, interest shall be calculated for each portion up to the day of credit\nand refund. (f) Deposit\nreturn. (1)\nA utility shall return a deposit\nor portion thereof, plus the applicable interest, in accordance with paragraphs\n(2) and (3) of this subdivision, as soon as reasonably possible, but no more\nthan 30 calendar days after: (i) the day an\naccount is closed; (ii)\nthe\nissuance date of the first cycle bill rendered after a three-year period during\nwhich all bills were timely paid, provided there is no other basis for the\nutility to request a deposit under subparagraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section; or\n(iii)\na review pursuant to\nsubdivision (c) of this section shows that deposit reduction is\nwarranted.

(3)\n\nIf a balance remains after a utility has\ncredited the customer's account(s) in accordance with paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, a refund check shall be issued to the customer.
