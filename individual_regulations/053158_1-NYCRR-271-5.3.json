  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 §§ 271-5.3 - Manual cleaning and sanitizing\n\nState Regulations\n\nFacilities and/or equipment shall be available, either in\na servicing area or in place, to provide for proper cleaning and sanitizing of\nall food-contact surfaces including product modules, lids and dispensing\nutensils. (a) For manual cleaning and\nsanitizing of equipment and utensils, a sink with two or three compartments\nshall be provided and used. Sink compartments shall be large enough to\naccommodate the immersion of most equipment and utensils, and each compartment\nof the sink shall be supplied with hot and cold potable running water. Where\nimmersion in sinks is impracticable (\ne.g., because equipment\nis too large), equipment and utensils shall be cleaned and sanitized manually\nor by pressure spray methods. (b) Drain boards or easily movable utensil tables of adequate size shall be\nprovided for proper storage and handling of soiled utensils prior to cleaning\nand for cleaned utensils following sanitizing and shall be located so as not to\ninterfere with proper use of the warewashing facilities. (c) Equipment and utensils shall be\npreflushed or prescraped and, when necessary, presoaked to remove food\nparticles and soil. (d) The sinks\nshall be cleaned before use. (e) When a three-compartment sink is utilized for warewashing, the operation shall\nbe conducted in the following sequence: (1)\nequipment and utensils shall be thoroughly cleaned in the first compartment\nwith a hot detergent solution that is kept clean and at a concentration\nindicated on the manufacturer's label; (2)\nequipment and utensils shall be rinsed\nfree of detergent and abrasives with clean water in the second compartment; and\n(3)\nequipment and utensils\nshall be sanitized in the third compartment according to one of the methods\nincluded in paragraphs (h)(1)-(5) of this sections. (f) When a two-compartment sink is utilized\nfor warewashing, one of the following two methods shall be used: (1)\nequipment and utensils shall be\nthoroughly cleaned in the first compartment with a hot detergent solution that\nis kept clean and at a concentration indicated on the manufacturer's label, and\nshall be sanitized in hot water in the second compartment in accordance with\nparagraph (h)(1) of this section; or\n(2)\nequipment and utensils shall be\nthoroughly cleaned in the first compartment with a hot detergent-sanitizer\nsolution that is kept clean and at a concentration indicated on the\nmanufacturer's label, and shall be sanitized in the second compartment in hot\nwater in accordance with paragraph (h)(1) of this section or with a solution\ncontaining that same detergent-sanitizer in accordance with paragraphs\n(h)(2)-(5) of this section. (g) When pressure spray methods are utilized\nfor cleaning and sanitizing, the equipment and utensils shall be thoroughly\nflushed with a detergent-sanitizer solution until the article is free of\nvisible food particles and soil. The detergent-sanitizer shall be used in\naccordance with the manufacturer's instructions and shall be of the type that\ndoes not require a potable water rinse when used according to those\ninstructions. (h) The food-contact\nsurfaces of all equipment and utensils shall be sanitized by: (1)\nimmersion for at least 1/2 minute in\nclean, hot water of a temperature of 170°F (congruent to 77°C) or\ngreater; (2)\nimmersion for at least\none minute in a clean solution containing 50 parts per million of available\nchlorine as a hypochlorite and having a temperature of at least 75°F (congruent\nto 24°C) or greater; (3)\nimmersion\nfor at least one minute in a clean solution containing 12.5 parts per million\nof available iodine, having a pH range which the manufacturer has demonstrated\nto be effective and a temperature of at least 75°F (congruent to 24°C) or\ngreater; (4)\nimmersion for at least\none minute in a clean solution containing 200 parts per million in a quaternary\nammonium compound and having a temperature of 75°F (congruent to 24°C) or\ngreater. The quaternary ammonium compound used shall have been compounded by\nthe manufacturer to assure effectiveness in waters up to 500 parts per million\nhardness at use concentration; (5)\nimmersion in a clean solution containing any other chemical sanitizing agent\nallowed under title 21 of the\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, section 178.1010, (revised as of April 1, 2013), pages 362-371, published by\nthe Office of the Federal Register and available from the Superintendent of\n\nDocuments, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, that will\nprovide the equivalent bactericidal effect of a solution containing at least 50\nparts per million of available chlorine as a hypochlorite at a temperature of\n75°F (congruent to 24°C) or greater for one minute; (6)\ntreatment with steam, free from materials\nor additives other than those specified in title 21 of the\n\nCode of\n\nFederal Regulations, section 173.310, (revised as of April 1, 2013), pages 140-142, published by the Office of Federal Register and available from\nthe Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402, in the case of equipment too large to sanitize by immersion, but in\nwhich steam can be confined; or\n(7)\nrinsing, spraying, or swabbing with a chemical sanitizing solution of at least\ntwice the strength required for that particular sanitizing solution under\nparagraphs (2), (3) and (5) of this subdivision in the case of equipment too\nlarge to sanitize by immersion. (i) When hot water is used for sanitizing, the following equipment shall be provided and used: (1)\nan integral heating device or fixture\ninstalled in, on or under the sanitizing compartment of the sink capable of\nmaintaining the water at a temperature of 170°F (congruent to 77°C) or\ngreater; (2)\na numerically scaled\nindicating thermometer, accurate to plus or minus 3°F (congruent to plus or\nminus 1°C) convenient to the sink for frequent checks of water temperature; and\n(3)\nutensil racks or baskets of\nsuch size and design to permit complete immersion of utensils and equipment in\nthe hot water. (j) When\nchemicals are used for sanitization, they shall not have concentrations higher\nthan the maximum permitted under title 21 of the\n\nCode of Federal\n\nRegulations, section 178.1010, (revised as of April 1, 2013), pages\n362-371, published by the Office of the Federal Register and available from the\n\nSuperintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC\n20402, and a test kit or other device that measures the parts per million\nconcentration of the solution shall be provided and used.
