(e) In-kind income. (1)\n\nEarned or unearned in-kind income\nreceived from legally responsible relatives living outside the MA household is\nconsidered available income pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section. In-kind income received from anyone other than a legally responsible relative\nis considered available income only if it is earned income. Gifts and one- time\ncontributions are not considered available income, regardless of the source; however, they can be counted against the resource standard. (2)\n\nThe value of in-kind income will be\ndetermined based on the current market value of the goods or services received. The current market value is the amount that would be received if the goods or\nservices were sold on the open market in the applicant' s/recipient's local\narea. However, the value of housing provided as in-kind income will be the\ncurrent market value of the housing or the social services district's maximum\nshelter allowance, whichever is less. (f) Legally responsible relatives. (1)\n\nThis paragraph explains when the income\nand resources of a legally responsible relative is considered available to an\nMA applicant/recipient.

With respect to MA applicants/recipients who are 65 years\nof age or older, certified blind, or certified disabled, the amount of a\nlegally responsible relative's income, if any, to be deemed available to the\napplicant/recipient will be determined in accordance with Federal supplemental\nsecurity income program regulations providing for the allocation of an amount\nof such relative's income to meet the needs of certain family members living\nwith the applicant/recipient. The applicant/recipient will not be denied MA if\nthe legally responsible relative refuses or fails to contribute toward the\napplicant's/recipient's medical support. However, the furnishing of MA will\ncreate an implied contract with the legally responsible relative and the cost\nof any MA provided may be recovered from such relative by the social services\ndistrict pursuant to sections\n101\nand\n366\n(3)(a)\nof the Social Services Law. (ii)\n\nLegally responsible relative living\napart from a noninstitutionalized MA applicant/recipient. The legally\nresponsible relative, if of sufficient financial ability, will be asked to\ncontribute a portion of his/her income and resources to the MA\napplicant/recipeint. Regardless of the amount of any requested contribution, only the amount that the legally responsible relative actually contributes to\nthe noninstitutionalized MA applicant/recipient will be considered available\nwhen determining MA eligibility. However, the social services district may seek\nto recover the cost of any MA provided from the legally responsible relative\npursuant to sections\n101\nand\n366\n(3)(a)\nof the Social Services Law. (iii)\n\nSpouses living apart due to\ninstitutionalization of one spouse. The ability of the community spouse to\ncontribute income to the institutionalized spouse's cost of care will be\ndetermined in accordance with section\n360-4.10\n(b) of\nthis Subpart. The availability of the community spouse's resources will be\ndetermined in accordance with section\n360-4.10\n(c) of\nthis Subpart. (iv)\n\nParents of a\nchild under the age of 21 who is certified blind or certified disabled and who\nis expected to be living separately from the parental household for 30 days or\nmore, will not be requested to make their income and resources available to\nmeet the cost of the child's necessary care or assistance; or to provide\ninformation concerning their income and resources. (2)\n(i) The\nsocial services district must request a legally responsible relative, other\nthan a community spouse as defined in section 360.4 -10 of this Subpart, to\ncontribute any excess resources toward the support the MA\napplicant/recipient. (ii)\n\nIn\ndetermining the amount of contribution to be requested, legally responsible\nrelatives who are not aged, certified blind, or certified disabled will be\nallowed the resource disregard in section\n360-4.6\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart and the standard resource exemptions listed in section\n360-4.7\n(a) of\nthis Subpart. Legally responsible relatives who are aged, certified blind, or\ncertified disabled will be allowed the resource disregards in section 360-\n4.6(b) of this Subpart and the standard resource exemptions listed in section\n360-4.7\n(a) of\nthis Subpart.
