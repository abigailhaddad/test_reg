  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.48 - Executive order no. 48: prescribing procedures to allocate the private activity bond volume ceiling under the deficit reduction act of 1984\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 establishes a\nprivate activity bond ceiling on a per capita basis for New York State; and\nWHEREAS, the ceiling applies to private activity bonds\nissued by both State and local agencies and will require that all such issues\nbe coordinated in order to comply with the ceiling; and\nWHEREAS, the application of the ceiling to private activity\nbond projects financed in New York State will require annual allocation\nauthorizations to State and local agencies, which may limit the ability of\ncertain issuers to finance projects; and\nWHEREAS, the State should maximize the public benefit of\nprivate activity bond issues and minimize conflicts among issuing agencies; and\nWHEREAS, the State should maximize the impact of business\ndevelopment and job development incentives particularly on distressed areas of\nthe State; and\nWHEREAS, the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 authorizes the\ngovernor of each state to proclaim a formula for allocating the private\nactivity bond volume limit among such governmental units in the state as have\nauthority to issue private activity bonds; NOW, THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws\nof the State of New York and the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, do hereby\nproclaim and order as follows: I. Definitions. A. Issuer shall mean a local\nagency, State agency or other issuer. B. Local agency shall mean an industrial\ndevelopment agency established or operating pursuant to article 18-A of the\n\nGeneral Municipal Law, the Troy Industrial Development Authority and the Auburn\n\nIndustrial Development Authority. C. State agency shall mean the Energy\n\nResearch and Development Authority, Job Development Authority, Environmental\n\nFacility Corporation, Urban Development Corporation and its subsidiaries, Battery Park City Authority, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Power\n\nAuthority of the State of New York, Dormitory Authority and United Nations\n\nDevelopment Corporation. D. Other\nissuer shall mean any agency, political subdivision or other entity, other than\na local agency or State agency, that is authorized to issue private activity\nbonds. E. Private activity bonds\nshall mean private activity bonds as defined in section 621 of the Deficit\n\nReduction Act of 1984. II. Aggregate Amount of Private Activity\n\nBonds. A. Private activity bond limit for\nlocal agencies-- in general. The private activity bond limit for local agencies\nshall be an amount which bears the same ratio to two fifths (40%) of the\nstatewide ceiling for any calendar year as the population of the jurisdiction\nof such local agency bears to the population of the entire State for any\ncalendar year. B. Private activity\nbond limit for State agencies-- in general. The private activity bond limit for\nall State agencies shall be two fifths (40%) of the statewide ceiling for any\ncalendar year. The Director of the Budget shall administer allocations under\nthe State agency limit and may grant an allocation to any State\nagency. C. Overlapping\njurisdictions. In a geographic area represented by a county and a subcounty\nlocal agency, the allocation granted by paragraph A of this article with\nrespect to such areas shall be split equally between the county and subcounty\nlocal agency for any calendar year. Where there is a local agency representing\na village within the geographic area of a town which is represented by a local\nagency, the allocation of the village local agency shall be based on the\npopulation of the geographic area of the village, and the allocation of the\ntown local agency shall be based upon the population of the geographic area of\nthe town outside of the village. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a local agency\nmay elect to surrender all or part of its allocation for such calendar year to\nanother local agency with overlapping jurisdiction. Such election shall be made\nat such time and in such manner as the Commissioner of Commerce shall\nprescribe. D. Municipal\nreallocation. The chief executive officer of any municipality which a local\nagency has been established to benefit may withdraw all or any portion of the\nallocation granted by paragraph A of this article to such local agency and\nreallocate all or any portion of such allocation to the municipality or other\nissuer established to benefit that municipality. E. Statewide bond reserve. One fifth (20%) of\nthe aggregate amount of private activity bonds authorized to be issued during\nany one calendar year is hereby allocated to a statewide bond reserve to be\nadministered by the Director of the Budget. 1. Allocation of the statewide bond reserve\namong State and local agencies and other issuers. The Director of the Budget\nshall allocate a portion of the statewide bond reserve to the Commissioner of\n\nCommerce for use by local agencies and other issuers in accordance with the\nterms of this section. The remainder of the statewide bond reserve may be\nallocated by the Director of the Budget to State agencies, in accordance with\nthe terms of this section. 2. Allocation of statewide bond reserve to local agencies or other issuers. (a) Local agencies or other issuers may at\nany time apply to the Commissioner of Commerce for an allocation from the\nstatewide bond reserve. Such application shall demonstrate: (i) that in the case of a local agency, prior\nto the close of the calendar year for which the allocation is requested, the\nlocal agency's remaining unused allocation will be insufficient to finance a\nspecific project or projects; and\n(ii)\nthat the proposed project or projects\nfor which the allocation is requested constitute a valid public purpose and\nwould contribute to economic development in New York State. (b) The Commissioner of\n\nCommerce shall not approve any allocation from the statewide bond reserve to\nfinance any project to be used directly or indirectly for: (i) a facility more than 25 percent of which\nis used to make retail sales of goods or services to customers who personally\nvisit such facility to obtain goods or services, unless such facility is to be\nlocated in a chronically depressed area, as defined by the Commissioner of\n\nCommerce; (ii)\na facility more than\n25 percent of which is occupied by doctors, lawyers or similar professionals\nprincipally serving local markets, unless located in a chronically depressed\narea as defined by the Commissioner of Commerce; (iii)\na facility primarily used for overnight\nlodging, unless located in a chronically depressed area as defined by the\n\nCommissioner of Commerce, or unless primarily used in support of tourism\ndevelopment, as defined by the Commissioner of Commerce; (iv)\na facility licensed and regulated\npursuant to article 28 of the Public Health Law. (c) In reviewing and approving or\ndisapproving applications, the Commissioner of Commerce shall exercise his\ndiscretion to ensure an equitable distribution of allocations from the\nstatewide bond reserve to local agencies and other issuers. (d) Applications for allocations shall be\nmade in such form and contain such information as the Commissioner of Commerce\nshall require. (3)\n\nAllocation of statewide bond reserve to State agencies. The Director of the\n\nBudget may grant an allocation from the statewide bond reserve to any State\nagency\n(4)\n\nYear-end allocation\nadjustment. On or before November 1, 1984, each State agency shall report to\nthe Director of the Budget, and each local agency and each other issuer shall\nreport to the Commissioner of Commerce, the amount of bonds subject to\nallocation that will be issued prior to the end of the 1984 calendar year, and\nthe amount of the issuer's allocation that will remain unused. As of November\n15, 1984, the unused portion of each issuer's allocation as reported and the\nunallocated portion of private activity bond limit for State agencies shall be\nadded to the statewide bond reserve and shall no longer be available to the\nissuers except as otherwise provided herein. On or before December 1, 1984, each issuer shall update its report on its bond issuance plans and any\nadditional portion of each issuer's allocation that will remain unused as so\nreported shall be added to the statewide bond reserve as of December 1, 1984. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Commissioner of Commerce determines that\na local agency or other issuer has overestimated the amount of bonds subject to\nallocation that will be issued prior to the end of the calendar year, he may\nwithdraw the amount of the allocation to such local agency or other issuer\nrepresented by such overestimation by notice to the local agency or other\nissuer and add such allocation to the statewide bond reserve. F. Carry-forward of allocation. (1)\n\nNo local agency or other issuer shall\nexercise its option to carry forward a portion of its annual allocation for use\nin future years (pursuant to Internal Revenue Code, section 103[n][10]) without\nthe prior approval of the Commissioner of Commerce, and no State agency shall\nexercise such an option without the prior approval of the Director of the\n\nBudget. (2)\n\nOn or before November\n15th of each year, each State agency seeking to carry forward an allocation for\nuse in future years shall make a request for such a carry-forward to the\n\nDirector of the Budget. A later request may also be considered by the director. The director may authorize a carry-forward for any State agency. (3)\n\nOn or before November 15th of each year, each local agency or other issuer seeking to carry forward an allocation for\nuse in future years shall make a request for such a carry-forward to the\n\nCommissioner of Commerce. A later request may also be considered by the\ncommissioner. The commissioner may authorize a carry-forward for any local\nagency or other issuer. G. Access to employment opportunities. It is\nthe policy of New York State to assure that the use of private activity bonds\nresults in the creation of new job opportunities for poor and chronically\nunemployed New Yorkers. (1)\n\nAll issuers shall\nrequire that any new employment opportunities created in connection with\nindustrial or commercial projects financed through the issuance of private\nactivity bonds shall be listed with the New York State Department of Labor Job\n\nService Division, and with the administrative entity of the service delivery\narea created pursuant to the Job Training Partnership Act ( P.L. 97-300) in\nwhich the project is located. Such listing shall be in a manner and form\nprescribed by the Commissioner of Commerce. (2)\n\nEach State agency shall further require\nthat, to the extent practicable and feasible, at least 10 percent of any new\njobs created in connection with an industrial or commercial project financed\nthrough the issuance of private activity bonds by such agency in amounts of one\nmillion dollars or more shall be filled by persons eligible for service under\nthe Job Training Partnership Act. (3)\n\nIssuers of private activity bonds are\nrequired to monitor compliance with the provisions of this section as\nprescribed by the Commissioner of Commerce. (4)\n\nNothing in this section shall be\nconstrued to require users of private activity bonds to violate any existing\ncollective bargaining agreement with respect to the hiring of new\nemployees. (5)\n\nFailure on the part\nof any user of private activity bonds to comply with the requirements of this\nsection shall not affect the allocation of bonding authority to the issuing\nagency, or the validity or tax exempt status of such bonds. III. Procedures and\n\nGuidelines. The Director of the Budget and Commissioner of Commerce are\nauthorized and directed to establish procedures and guidelines to implement the\nprovisions of this order. Such procedures and guidelines shall set forth the\namount of the statewide private activity bond limit and provide guidance for\nissuers, procedures for making applications, standards and criteria for\ngranting approvals, allocations and carry- forwards of allocations, and a\nmethod of tracking the issuance of private activity bonds by issuers. Such\nprocedures and guidelines may address any other matters as the Director of the\n\nBudget and Commissioner of Commerce deem appropriate. IV. Effectiveness. Nothing contained in this order shall be deemed to\nsupersede, alter or impair any provision of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984\nor any regulations promulgated thereunder. If any provision of this order is\nadjudged or ruled invalid, such judgment or ruling shall not affect any other\nprovisions of this order. V. Retroactivity. Any allocation to a local agency pursuant to paragraph A of\narticle II of this order shall be reduced by the amount of private activity\nbonds subject to allocation which were issued by such local agency prior to the\neffective date of this order. If the amount of such bonds issued prior to the\neffective date of this order exceeds the allocation pursuant to such paragraph\nA, the statewide bond reserve shall be reduced by the amount of such excess. The statewide bond reserve shall also be reduced by the amount of any private\nactivity bonds subject to allocation which were issued by any other\nissuer. VI. Expiration. The provisions of this order shall expire on the effective\ndate of legislation enacted into law for the purpose of allocating the private\nactivity bond ceiling under the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 and be of no\nfurther effect after that date.
