  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-26.10 - Computation of estimated market value ratio\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The estimated market value of each \"S\"\nand \"T\" interval in each class shall be computed as follows: (1)\n\nCompute the average assessed value of the\nsample parcels in each \"S\" interval therein by summing the assessed values of\nthe appraised sample parcels in the interval and dividing the sum by the number\nof appraised sample parcels in the interval. (2)\n\nCompute the average market value of the\nsample parcels in each \"S\" interval therein by summing the market values of the\nappraised sample parcels in the interval and dividing the sum by the number of\nappraised sample parcels in the interval. (3)\n\nCompute the numerator of the weighted\naverage market value ratio of the \"S\" intervals in the class by first\nmultiplying the average assessed value of the sample parcels in each interval\nby the number of parcels therein, and then summing the resulting\nproducts. (4)\n\nCompute the\ndenominator of the weighted average market value ratio of the \"S\" intervals in\nthe class by first multiplying the average market value of the sample parcels\nin each interval by the number of parcels therein, and then summing the\nresulting products. (5)\n\nCompute the\nweighted average market value ratio of the \"S\" interval in the class by\ndividing the numerator by the denominator. (6)\n\nCompute the estimated market value of\neach \"S\" interval in the class by dividing the total assessed value of the\ninterval by the ratio determined in paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision. (7)\n\nSet the assessed\nvalue and estimated market value of each \"T\" interval equal to the assessed\nvalue and appraised value, respectively, of the corresponding large\nunit. (b) The estimated\nmarket value of each \"U\" interval is computed as follows: (1)\n\nIn a special assessing unit: (i) Compute the weighted average market value\nratio of all \"S\" and \"T\" intervals in a class in a special assessing unit by: (a) summing the total assessed values of all\n\"S\" and \"T\" intervals in the class in the special assessing unit; (b) summing the estimated market values of\nall \"S\" and \"T\" intervals in the class of the special assessing unit; and\n(c) dividing (a) by\n(b). (ii)\n\nCompute the\nestimated market value of each \"U\" interval in the class in the special\nassessing unit by dividing the total assessed value of each such interval by\nthe ratio determined in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (2)\n\nFor all other municipalities: (i) Compute the weighted average market value\nratio of all \"S\" and \"T\" intervals in the municipality by: (a) summing the total assessed values of all\n\"S\" and \"T\" intervals in the municipality; (b) summing the estimated market values of\nall \"S\" and \"T\" intervals in the municipality; and\n(c) dividing (a) by (b). (ii)\n\nCompute the estimated market value of\neach \"U\" interval in the municipality by dividing the total assessed value of\neach such interval by the ratio determined in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. (c) The estimated market value of each survey\nunit on the classified roll shall be computed as follows: (1)\n\nDetermine the total estimated market\nvalue of each class therein by summing the estimated market values of all of\nthe intervals in the class. (2)\n\nDetermine the total estimated market value of the survey unit by summing the\nestimated market values of all the intervals therein. (d) For each special assessing unit or\nhomestead assessing unit, the estimated market value ratio of each class in\neach portion and the estimated market value ratio of each class in the special\nassessing unit or homestead assessing unit are computed as follows: (1)\n\nDetermine the total estimated market\nvalue of each class in each portion by summing the estimated market values of\nall of the intervals in each class in each portion. (2)\n\nDetermine the market value ratio of each\nclass in each portion by dividing the total assessed value thereof by the total\nestimated market value thereof. (3)\n\nDetermine the total estimated market value of each class in the special\nassessing unit or homestead assessing unit by summing the estimated market\nvalue of all of the intervals in the class in the special assessing unit or\nhomestead assessing unit. (4)\n\nDetermine the market value ratio of each class in the special assessing unit or\nhomestead assessing unit by dividing the total assessed value thereof by the\ntotal estimated market value thereof. (5)\n\nFor purposes of establishing class ratios\npursuant to former 9 NYCRR Subpart\n186-8, as repealed in 1997, the estimated\nclass market value ratio shall be computed in accordance with the following\nprocedure: (i) Obtain from the assessor's\nreport for the base year roll the initial assessment for the class. (ii)\n\nObtain from the survey data the\nestimated class market value except that parcels in class 1B and class 2B shall\nbe excluded. (iii)\n\nThe estimated\nclass market value ratio on the base year roll is determined by dividing the\ninitial assessment determined in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph by the\nestimated class market value determined in subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph. (e) The estimated market value ratio of each\nmunicipality, special assessing unit and portion on the classified roll shall\nbe computed as follows: (1)\n\nDetermine the\ntotal estimated market value thereof by summing the estimated market values of\nall of the survey units therein. (2)\n\nDivide the total assessed value of the\nproperty on the classified roll by the total estimated market value\nthereof. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
