Tit. 9 § 351.5 - Assessment and case planning\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe time frame for assessment and case planning completion\nshall be up to 30 business days which begins at the date of the initial\ninterview and extends no longer than completion of the case plan. During this\ntime, the probation department shall: (a) Conduct the initial interview. The\ninitial interview with the probationer by the assigned probation officer, another probation officer, or auxiliary probation personnel shall occur within\neight business days from the date of assignment. When the initial interview is\nconducted by auxiliary probation personnel, it shall consist only of imparting\nto the probationer necessary preliminary information and instructions relating\nto the probation disposition or interim probation supervision; information on\nwhen, where, and to whom to report; and ensuring that the probationer is\nprovided with a copy of his order and conditions of probation. (1)\n\nWhere the probationer is unavailable for\nthe initial interview during the required eight business day time frame because\nhe/she is incarcerated, in detention, or in placement, the initial interview\nshall occur prior to release from custody, with the goal of establishing the\nsupervision relationship. (2)\n\nIf\nthe initial interview is not conducted within the required eight business day\ntime frame because the probationer is unavailable, the probation department\nshall document the reasons for the delay in the case file. (b) Complete the risk and need assessment, if\nnot already completed at investigation. Probation departments may complete\nother specialized assessments, where available. (1)\n\nAssign supervision level. The risk\nassessment instrument shall assist the department in determining the\nappropriate supervision level assignment. When the assessment is complete, the\nprobationer shall be assigned according to risk level and/or over-ride as\ngreatest risk; high risk; medium risk; low risk; or designated an\nadministrative case, if criteria is met, and the department shall satisfy\napplicable probation supervision requirements set forth in section\n351.6\nof\nthis Part. If the department imposes a supervision level different than that\nindicated by the risk assessment, the reason for the over-ride shall conform to\ncriteria approved by the probation director, consistent with department policy, and be documented in the case record. (2)\n\nSupervision pending classification. Pending initial classification the department shall provide appropriate\nsupervision during assessment and case planning which shall include in-person\ncontact every week until the assessment and case plan are completed. (c) Confirm that all applicable\nlegal case requirements are met, including: (1)\nDNA sample obtained; (2)\n\nSex Offender Registration Act (SORA)\nstatus compliance; (3)\nfingerprints\nobtained; and\n(4)\nwhere ordered, a\nrestitution account is established for collection. (d) Develop and implement the case plan in\naccordance with department policy. The case plan shall be developed by\nprobation personnel and shall be based primarily on the information provided in\nthe risk and need assessment instrument and any other specialized assessments\nthat may be completed. Case planning shall include efforts to engage the\nprobationer and his/her family. The plan shall be developed to remediate the\nunderlying behavior which gave rise to the need for probation supervision by\naddressing the identified risks and needs, and incorporating the protective\nfactors and strengths. Effective case planning includes the following\nactivities: (1)\nprovide feedback of\nassessment results to probationer; (2)\nutilize motivational interviewing to\nengage the probationer in the case plan development; (3)\ndetermine the probationer's level of\nmotivation to change his/her behavior; and\n(4)\nmatch case planning goals and strategies\nto probationer's level of motivation to change his/her behavior: (i) for low risk probationers case planning\nshould be minimal--referring for services related to the conditions of\nprobation; (ii)\nfor medium\nrisk/high risk/greatest risk probationers, case plans shall identify the\npriority criminogenic needs to be addressed in order to reduce risk. (e) Case plans shall\nfocus on three steps: (1)\n\nLong term\ngoals--achievable by the end of probation. (2)\n\nShort term goals--achievable from\nreassessment to reassessment. (3)\n\nAction steps--achievable from one probationer contact to the next. (f) Case plans shall identify the\nroles and responsibilities of each person involved in the case plan, and\nrealistic time frames for achieving stated goals. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
