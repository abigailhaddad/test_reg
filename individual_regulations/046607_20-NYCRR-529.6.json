(2)\n\nIn addition to the formal organizational\nrequirement, an HMO must prove that it is both organized and operated\nexclusively as a health maintenance organization under article 44 of the New\n\nYork State Public Health Law and not for pecuniary profit or financial gain. If\nthe corporation fails to meet either the organizational test or the operational\ntest set forth in subdivisions (c) and (d) of this section, it is not\nexempt. (c) Organizational test. (1)\nA\nnot-for-profit corporation acting as a health maintenance organization will\nsatisfy the organizational test only if its articles of incorporation: (i) contain a provision prohibiting the\ndistribution of its income and assets, in whole or part, to the benefit of any\ndirector, officer, member or other private person; (ii)\nlimit the purposes of such corporation\nto the provision of comprehensive health services to an enrolled population for\na basic advance or periodic charge; and\n(iii)\ndo not expressly empower the\ncorporation to participate, other than as an insubstantial part of its\nactivities, in activities which themselves are not in furtherance of such\npurposes. (2)\n\nHowever, the not-for-profit corporation may: (i) pay\nreasonable compensation for services actually rendered; and\n(ii)\nmake reimbursements for expenses\nreasonably and necessarily incurred in carrying out the purposes of a health\nmaintenance organization. (d) Operational test. (1)\n\nActivities.

A not-for-profit corporation will not be considered to be\noperating exclusively as a health maintenance organization unless in accordance\nwith the Public Health Law it has received a certificate of authority from the\n\nNew York State Department of Health. (3)\n\nNoninurement requirement.

(3)\n\nWhen an HMO changes its structural form\n(\ne.g., one not-for-profit corporation consolidating or merging\nwith another not-for-profit corporation), it must submit an application and\nsupporting documents for an exempt organization certificate in order to\nestablish the new entity's status for sales tax exemption. (4)\n\nAn exempt organization certificate may be\nrevoked if there is misuse of the exemption granted, or if it is discovered\nthat the HMO's application contained misleading or deceptive information, or if\nthe HMO fails to notify the taxpayer assistance bureau as provided by this\nsubdivision of any change in its purposes, activities, organizational structure\nor of the revocation, limitation or annulment of its certificate of authority\nto operate as a health maintenance organization. Where the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance determines it to be appropriate, such as circumstances\nevidencing the intentional misuse and/or other similar misuse of the exemption\ngranted the revocation may be effective retroactively to the date of misuse. Cross-reference: For misuse and revocation, see section\n529.1\n(j) of this Part. (g) Sales to HMO's.

Direct purchaser, occupant or patron as used in this paragraph, includes any agent or employee\nauthorized by the HMO to act on its behalf when making purchases, provided the\ncorporation and its agent or employee are both identified on any bill or\ninvoice. An HMO is the direct payer of record where direct payment is made by\nthe corporation or from the corporation's funds directly to the\nvendor. (3)\n\nAn exempt organization\ncertification is deemed to be properly completed when it contains the: (i) name and address of the vendor; (ii)\nname and address of the HMO; (iii)\nnumber assigned to the exempt\norganization certificate; (iv)\nsignature of a responsible officer of the exempt HMO; and\n(v) date the certification was\nexecuted. (4)\n\nSales to\nany member, officer, or employee of an exempt HMO are subject to the sales and\nuse tax when the sales are for the personal use of the purchaser rather than\nthe corporation. (h) Sales by HMO's. Sales of tangible personal property, services and food and\ndrink by HMO's exempt under section 1116(a)(7) of article 28 of the Tax Law are\nnot subject to the sales and use tax.
