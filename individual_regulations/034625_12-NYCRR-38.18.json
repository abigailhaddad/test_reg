  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 38.18 - Occupational dose limits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Occupational dose limits for adults. (1)\n\nExcept for planned special exposures pursuant to subdivision (f) of this\nsection, no person shall transfer, receive, possess or use any radiation source\nso as to cause any individual adult to receive an occupational dose from all\nsources of radiation that exceeds any of the following limits: (i) an annual limit, which is the more\nlimiting of: (a) a total effective dose\nequivalent equal to 0.05 Sv (5 rem); or\n(b) the sum of the deep dose equivalent and\nthe committed dose equivalent to any individual organ or tissue, other than the\nlens of the eye, equal to 0.50 Sv (50 rem); (ii)\nannual limits to the lens of the eye, to\nthe skin, and to the extremities which are: (a) an eye dose equivalent of 0.15 Sv (15\nrem); and\n(b) a shallow dose\nequivalent of 0.50 Sv (50 rem) to the skin or to any extremity. (2)\n\nDoses received in\nexcess of the annual limits, including doses received during accidents, emergencies, and planned special exposures must be subtracted from the limits\nfor planned special exposures that the individual may receive during the\ncurrent year and during the individual's lifetime. (See paragraph [f][5] of\nthis section.)\n(3)\n\nThe assigned\ndeep dose equivalent and shallow dose equivalent shall be for the portion of\nthe body receiving the highest exposure. If an individual's monitoring device\nwas not in the region of highest potential exposure, or the results of\nindividual monitoring are unavailable, the deep dose equivalent, eye dose\nequivalent and shallow dose equivalent may be assessed from surveys or other\nradiation measurements for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with the\noccupational dose limits. (4)\n\nDerived air concentration (DAC) and annual limit on intake (ALI) values are\npresented in Appendix A-13 of section\n38.41\nof this Part (rule), and may\nbe used to determine the individual's dose and to demonstrate compliance with\nthe occupational dose limits. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding the annual dose limits, the licensee shall limit the soluble\nuranium intake by an individual to 10 milligrams in a week. (See footnote 3 of\n\nAppendix A-13 of section\n38.41\nof this Part\n[rule].)\n(6)\n\nThe licensee or\nregistrant shall reduce the dose that an individual may be allowed to receive\nin the current year by the amount of occupational dose received while employed\nby any other person. (See subdivision [e]of this section.)\n(b) Compliance with requirements for\nsummation of external and internal dose. (1)\n\nRequirements for summation of external and internal doses. If the licensee or\nregistrant is required to monitor pursuant to both subdivisions (a) and (b) of\nsection\n38.24\nof this Part (rule), the\nlicensee or registrant shall demonstrate compliance with the dose limits by\nsumming external and internal doses. If the licensee or registrant is required\nto monitor only pursuant to section\n38.24\n(a) or only\npursuant to section\n38.24\n(b) of this\n\nPart (rule), then summation is not required in order to demonstrate compliance\nwith the dose limits. The licensee or registrant may demonstrate compliance\nwith the requirements for summation of external and internal doses by meeting\none of the conditions specified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, and the\nconditions in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subdivision. The dose equivalents\nfor the lens of the eye, the skin, and the extremities are not to be included\nin the summation, but are subject to separate limits. (2)\n\nIntake by inhalation. If the only intake\nof radionuclides is by inhalation, the total effective dose equivalent limit is\nnot exceeded if the sum of the deep dose equivalent divided by the total\neffective dose equivalent limit, and one of the following, does not exceed\nunity: (i) the sum of the fractions of the\ninhalation ALI for each radionuclide; or\n(ii)\nthe total number of derived air\nconcentrations-hours (DAC-hours) for all radionuclides divided by 2,000; or\n(iii)\nthe sum of the calculated\ncommitted effective dose equivalents to all significantly irradiated organs or\ntissues (T) calculated from bioassay data using appropriate biological models\nand expressed as a fraction of the annual limit. For purposes of this\nrequirement, an organ or tissue is deemed to be significantly irradiated if, for that organ or tissue, the product of the weighting factors, W\nT, and the committed dose equivalent, H\nT,50, per unit intake is greater than 10 percent of the\nmaximum weighted value of H\n50, that is, W\nT\nH\nT,50\nper unit intake for any\norgan or tissue. (3)\n\nIntake by oral ingestion. If the occupationally exposed individual also\nreceives an intake of radionuclides by oral ingestion greater than 10 percent\nof the applicable oral ALI, the licensee or registrant shall account for this\nintake and include it in demonstrating compliance with the limits. (4)\n\nIntake through wounds or absorption\nthrough skin. The licensee or registrant shall evaluate and account for intakes\nthrough wounds or skin absorption. The intake through intact skin has been\nincluded in the calculation of DAC for hydrogen-3 and does not need to be\nevaluated or accounted for pursuant to this paragraph. (c) Determination of external dose from\nairborne radioactive material. (1)\n\nLicensees\nshall, when determining the dose from airborne radioactive material, include\nthe contribution to the deep dose equivalent, eye dose equivalent, and shallow\ndose equivalent from external exposure to the radioactive cloud (see footnotes\n1 and 2 of Appendix A-13 of section\n38.41\nof this Part\n[rule]). (2)\n\nAirborne radioactivity\nmeasurements and DAC values shall not be used as the primary means to assess\nthe deep dose equivalent when the airborne radioactive material includes\nradionuclides other than noble gases or if the cloud of airborne radioactive\nmaterial is not relatively uniform. The determination of the deep dose\nequivalent to an individual in these cases shall be based upon measurements\nusing instruments or individual monitoring devices. (d) Determination of internal exposure. (1)\n\nFor purposes of assessing dose used to\ndeter mine compliance with occupational dose equivalent limits, the licensee\nshall, when required under section\n38.24\nof this Part (rule), take\nany of the following measurements as may be necessary for timely and\nappropriate detection and assessment of intake of radioactivity by individuals: (i) concentrations of radioactive materials\nin air in work areas; (ii)\nquantities of radionuclides in the body; (iii)\nquantities of radionuclides excreted\nfrom the body; or\n(iv)\ncombinations\nof these measurements. (2)\n\nUnless respiratory protective equipment\nis used, as provided in section\n38.26\nof this Part (rule), or the\nassessment of intake is based on bioassays, the licensee or registrant shall\nassume that an individual inhales radioactive material at the airborne\nconcentration in which the individual is present. (3)\n\nWhen specific information on the physical\nand biochemical properties of the radionuclides taken into the body or the\nbehavior of the material in an individual is known, the licensee or registrant\nmay: (i) use that information to calculate\nthe committed effective dose equivalent, and, if used, the licensee or\nregistrant shall document that information in the individual's record; and\n(ii)\nseparately assess the\ncontribution of fractional intakes of Class D, W, or Y compounds of a given\nradionuclide to the committed effective dose equivalent. (4)\n\nIf the licensee chooses to assess intakes\nof Class Y material using the measurements listed in subparagraph (1)(ii) or\n(iii) of this subdivision, the licensee or registrant may delay the recording\nand reporting of the assessments for periods up to seven months, unless\notherwise required by section\n38.29\n(b)(1) and\n(2)\nof this Part (rule). This delay permits\nthe licensee or registrant to make additional measurements basic to the\nassessments. (5)\n\nIf the identity\nand concentration of each radionuclide in a mixture are known, the fraction of\nthe DAC applicable to the mixture for use in calculating DAC-hours shall be\neither: (i) the sum of the ratios of the\nconcentration to the appropriate DAC value, that is, D, W, or Y, from Appendix\nA-13, for each radionuclide in the mixture; or\n(ii)\nthe ratio of the total concentration for\nall radionuclides in the mixture to the most restrictive DAC value for any\nradionuclide in the mixture. (6)\n\nIf the identity of each radionuclide in a\nmixture is known, but the concentration of one or more of the radionuclides in\nthe mixture is not known, the DAC for the mixture shall be the most restrictive\nDAC of any radionuclide in the mixture. (7)\n\nWhen a mixture of radionuclides in air\nexists, a licensee may disregard certain radionuclides in the mixture if: (i) the licensee uses the total activity of\nthe mixture in demonstrating compliance with the dose limits in subdivision (a)\nof this section and in complying with the monitoring requirements in section\n38.24\n(b) of this\n\nPart (rule); (ii)\nthe concentration\nof any radionuclide disregarded is less than 10 percent of its DAC; and\n(iii)\nthe sum of these\npercentages for all of the radionuclides disregarded in the mixture does not\nexceed 30 percent. (8)\n\nWhen determining the committed effective dose equivalent, the following\ninformation may be considered: (i) in order to\ncalculate the committed effective dose equivalent, the licensee or registrant\nmay assume that the inhalation of one ALI, or an exposure of 2,000 DAC-hours, results in a committed effective dose equivalent of 0.05 Sv (5 rem) for\nradionuclides that have their ALIs or DACs based on the committed effective\ndose equivalent; (ii)\nfor an ALI\nand associated DAC which are based upon the nonstochastic organ dose limit of\n0.50 Sv (50 rem), the intake of radionuclides that would result in a committed\neffective dose equivalent of 0.05 Sv (5 rem), that is, the stochastic ALI, is\nlisted in parentheses in Appendix A-13. The licensee or registrant may, as a\nsimplifying assumption, use the stochastic ALIs to determine committed\neffective dose equivalent. However, if the licensee or registrant uses the\nstochastic ALIs, the licensee or registrant shall also demonstrate that the\nlimit in clause (a)(1)(i)(b) of this section is met. (e) Determination of prior\noccupational dose. (1)\n\nFor each individual who\nmay enter the licensee's or registrant's restricted area and is likely to\nreceive, in a year, an occupational dose requiring monitoring pursuant to\nsection\n38.24\nof this Part (rule), the\nlicensee or registrant shall: (i) determine\nthe occupational radiation dose received during the current year; and\n(ii)\nrequest in writing the records of\nlifetime cumulative occupational radiation dose. (2)\n\nPrior to permitting an individual to\nparticipate in a planned special exposure, the licensee or registrant shall\ndetermine: (i) the internal and external\ndoses received by the individual from all previous planned special exposures; and\n(ii)\nall doses in excess of the\nlimits received during the individual's lifetime, including doses received\nduring accidents and emergencies. (3)\n\nIn complying with the requirements of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, a licensee or registrant may: (i) accept, as a record of the occupational\ndose that the individual received during the current year, a written signed\nstatement from the individual, or from the individual's most recent employer\nfor work involving radiation exposure, that discloses the nature and the amount\nof any occupational dose that the individual received during the current\nyear; (ii)\naccept, as the record of\nlifetime cumulative radiation dose, a completed and up-to- date department form\nfor cumulative occupational radiation exposure history, or equivalent, signed\nby the individual and countersigned by an appropriate official of the most\nrecent employer for work involving radiation exposure, or the individual' s\ncurrent employer, if the individual is not employed by the licensee or\nregistrant; and\n(iii)\nobtain\nreports of the individual's dose equivalent from the most recent employer for\nwork involving radiation exposure, or the individual's current employer, if the\nindividual is not employed by the licensee or registrant, by telephone, telegram, facsimile, or letter. The licensee or registrant shall request a\nwritten verification of the dose data if the authenticity of the transmitted\nreport cannot be established. (4)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall record\nthe exposure history, required by paragraph (1) of this subdivision, on the\ndepartment form for cumulative occupational radiation exposure history, or\nother clear and legible record and shall include all the information required\non that form. (i) The form or record shall\nshow each period in which the individual received occupational exposure to\nradiation or radioactive material and shall be signed by the individual who\nreceived the exposure. For each period for which the licensee or registrant\nobtains reports, the licensee or registrant shall use the dose shown in the\nreport in preparing the form or record. For any period for which the licensee\nor registrant does not obtain a report, the licensee or registrant shall place\na notation on the form or record indicating the periods of time for which data\nare not available. (ii)\n\nLicensees\nor registrants are not required to reevaluate the separate external dose\nequivalents and internal committed dose equivalents, or intakes of\nradionuclides, which were assessed under the regulations in effect before the\neffective date of these regulations. Occupational exposure histories obtained\nand recorded on the department form for cumulative occupational radiation\nexposure history before the effective date of these regulations would not have\nincluded effective dose equivalent, but may be used in the absence of specific\ninformation on the intake of radionuclides by the individual. (5)\n\nIf the licensee or registrant\nis unable to obtain complete records of an individual's current and previously\naccumulated occupational dose, the licensee or registrant shall: (i) when establishing administrative controls\nunder paragraph (a)(6) of this section for the current year, assume that the\nallowable dose limit for the individual is reduced by 12.5 mSv (1.25 rem) for\neach quarter for which records were unavailable and the individual was engaged\nin activities that could have resulted in occupational radiation exposure; and\n(ii)\nnot authorize the\nindividual to receive any planned special exposures. (6)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall retain\nthe records on the department form for cumulative occupational radiation\nexposure history or equivalent, until the commissioner terminates each\npertinent license or registration. The licensee or registrant shall retain\nrecords used in preparing this form or equivalent for three years after the\nrecord is made. (f) Planned special exposures. A licensee or registrant may authorize an adult\nworker to receive doses which are in addition to, and which are accounted for\nseparately from, the doses received under the limits specified in subdivision\n(a) of this section provided that each of the following conditions is\nsatisfied: (1)\n\nThe licensee or registrant\nauthorizes the planned special exposure only in an exceptional situation when\nalternatives that might avoid the higher exposure are unavailable or\nimpractical. (2)\n\nThe licensee or\nregistrant, and the employer if the employer is not the licensee or registrant, specifically authorizes the planned special exposure, in writing, before the\nexposure occurs. (3)\n\nBefore a\nplanned special exposure, the licensee or registrant ensures that each worker\ninvolved is: (i) informed of the purpose of\nthe planned operation; (ii)\ninformed of the estimated doses and associated potential risks and specific\nradiation levels or other conditions that might be involved in performing the\ntask; and\n(iii)\ninstructed in the\nmeasures to be taken to keep the dose ALARA considering other risks that may be\npresent. (4)\n\nPrior to\npermitting an individual to participate in a planned special exposure, the\nlicensee or registrant ascertains prior doses as required by paragraph (e)(2)\nof this section. (5)\n\nSubject to\nparagraph (a)(2) of this section, the licensee or registrant shall not\nauthorize a planned special exposure that would cause an individual to receive\na dose from all planned special exposures that would exceed: (i) the numerical values of any of the dose\nlimits in paragraph (a)(1) of this section in any year; and\n(ii)\nfive times the annual dose limits in\nparagraph (a)(1) of this section during the individual's lifetime. (6)\n\nThe licensee or registrant\nmaintains records of the conduct of a planned special exposure in accordance\nwith section\n38.28\n(e) of this\n\nPart and submits a written report in accordance with section\n38.29\n(d). (7)\n\nThe licensee or registrant records the\nbest estimate of the dose resulting from the planned special exposure in the\nindividual's record and informs the individual, in writing, of the dose within\n30 days from the date of the planned special exposure. The dose from planned\nspecial exposures shall not be considered in controlling future occupational\ndose of the individual pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section but shall\nbe included in evaluations required by paragraphs (4) and (5) of this\nsubdivision. (g) Occupational dose limits for minors. The annual occupational dose limits for\nminors are 10 percent of the annual occupational dose limits specified for\nadult workers in subdivision (a) of this section. (h) Dose to an embryo/fetus. (1)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall ensure\nthat the dose to an embryo/fetus during the entire pregnancy, which results\nfrom occupational exposure of a declared pregnant woman, does not exceed 5 mSv\n(0.5 rem). (See section\n38.28\n[f]of\nthis\n\nPart for recordkeeping requirements.)\n(2)\n\nThe licensee or registrant shall review\npast exposure history and adjust working conditions so as to avoid a monthly\ntotal effective dose equivalent of more than 50 mrem to the embryo/fetus of a\ndeclared pregnant woman. (3)\n\nThe\ndose to an embryo/fetus shall be taken as the sum of: (i) the deep dose equivalent to the declared\npregnant woman during the entire pregnancy period; and\n(ii)\nthe dose to the embryo/fetus from\nradionuclides in the embryo/fetus and radionuclides in the declared pregnant\nwoman during the entire pregnancy period. (4)\n\nIf by the time the woman declares\npregnancy to the licensee or registrant, the dose to the embryo/fetus exceeded\n4.5 mSv (0.45 rem), the licensee or registrant shall be deemed to be in\ncompliance with paragraph (1) of this subdivision if the additional dose to the\nembryo/fetus does not exceed 0.50 mSv (0.05 rem) during the remainder of the\npregnancy.
