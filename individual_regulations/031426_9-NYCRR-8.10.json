  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8.10 - Executive order no. 10: reducing costs for personal services contracts\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the State is in a fiscal crisis, and must take all\nfeasible measures to control its expenditures and achieve cost savings; WHEREAS, the 2011-12 Executive Budget sets forth a program\nto address this crisis, premised on the principle of shared sacrifice and\nreducing expenditures, through which the burden of putting the State's fiscal\nhouse in order is spread across a wide spectrum of interests; WHEREAS, the 2011-12 Executive Budget requires particularly\nsignificant cost reductions from state agencies, for whom the proposed budget\nwould bring about a ten percent reduction in operating expenses; WHEREAS, the State is continually reviewing personal\nservices contracts to reduce the number and cost of such contracts; WHEREAS, the State must do all it can to ensure that it is\ngetting the best possible price of contracts paid for with taxpayer dollars, and cannot merely follow the contracting practices of the past; NOW, THEREFORE, I, Andrew M. Cuomo, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nlaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: 1. The following definitions will apply for\npurposes of this order: a. \"Closely\n\nAffiliated Not for Profit Organization\" shall mean corporations closely\naffiliated with specific state agencies as defined by paragraph (d) of\nsubdivision five of section\nfifty three\na\nof the state finance law or their\nsuccessors\nb. \"Personal Services\n\nContract\" shall mean any contract entered into by a state agency with any\nprivate party, under which the agency believes that a majority of the costs of\nthe contract are attributable to compensation of the contractor's personnel. Personnel services contracts shall include contracts whose primary purpose is\nevaluation, research and analysis, data processing, computer programming, engineering, environmental assessment, health and mental health services, accounting, auditing, legal or similar services, with a total value of over two\nhundred thousand dollars. A \"personal services contract,\" for purposes of this\norder, shall not include any contract: i. whose price is governed by federal or state law; ii. for the purchase of\ncommodities; iii. whose renewal\nmust be subject to a competitive bid; iv. with a preferred source, as that term is\ndefined by State Finance Law § 162; or\nv. necessary for compliance with Article 15-A\nof the Executive Law and any regulations issued thereunder. c. \"State agency\" shall mean any\nstate agency, department, office, board, bureau, division, committee, council\nor office. d. \"Single source\" shall\nhave the meaning set forth in State Finance Law § 163. e. \"Renewal\" shall mean the negotiation of a\nnew contract with an entity already providing services to the State of a kind\nequivalent to that to be provided for in such new contract, but which shall not\ninclude a contract extension whose price is specifically provided for in the\nexisting contract. 2. Each state agency shall, upon the expiration of a personal services Single\nsource contract, agree to a renewal of such contract only if the contractor\nagrees to a reduction in the State's annual costs of no less than ten per cent\noff the annual cost of the prior contract (the \"mandatory reduction target\"), except as provided for in paragraph 4. Such reduction may be reached by\nadjustment of the price, or by such other measures whose combined value to the\n\nState totals at least ten per cent of the annual cost of the prior\ncontract. 3. Any state agency that\ndetermines that it cannot secure the reduction in contract price provided for\nby section 2 of this Order shall, in writing to the Director of State\n\nOperations prior to any signing of or agreement to such contract renewal: a. State the reduction that was achieved; and\nb. (1)\n\nDescribe all efforts that the agency has\nmade to secure such a reduction, including any efforts to seek an alternative\ncontractor at a lower price, and set forth the reasons for the agency's\ndetermination that such a reduction cannot be achieved; or\n(2)\nset forth any reasons as to why such\nefforts cannot be made, including any legal restrictions not set forth in\nsection 1 of this Order, provided that past practice shall not by itself be a\nsufficient reason not to comply with this Order. An agency submitting the statement provided for by this\nparagraph shall not proceed with the contract renewal without the approval of\nthe Director of State Operations or his or her designee. 4. In addition to\ncontracts covered by paragraph 2, each state agency shall, prior to the\nexpiration of a Personal Services Contract that provides the agency the option\nto continue the contract at an equal or higher cost, take all reasonable\nmeasures to ensure that the same services may not be acquired at a lower price. Such measures shall include: (a) discussions\nwith the contractor regarding its acceptance of lower price terms; (b) evaluation of whether re-bidding the\ncontract will produce greater cost savings; and\n(c) consultation with the Director of State\n\nAgency Redesign and Efficiency to determine if savings can be achieved by\naggregating such the contract with other contracts with the same contractor. Prior to any such renewal, the state agency shall advise the Director of State\n\nOperations of such steps, and the basis for its decision to seek\nrenewal. 5. The Director\nof State Operations may from time to time review the application of the\nmandatory reduction target to particular classes of contracts or contracts by\nparticular agencies, and may in writing to affected agencies reduce or increase\nsuch target for such contracts. 6. All state agencies are directed to seek reductions in contracting expenses in\naddition to those set forth in this order, including through reductions in the\ncosts of contract renewals that exceed those of the mandatory reduction\ntargets. 7. Agencies are encouraged\nto seek all other reasonable and lawful means to reduce the costs of their\npersonal services contracts. Agencies should provide whatever assistance and\nsupport may be warranted to assist contractors in reducing their costs, including the costs of subcontracts, so that they may achieve the savings\nprovided for in this Order. 8. The\n\nSpending and Government Efficiency Commission (\"Commission\"), created by\n\nExecutive Order No. 4, shall review the State's practices regarding contracts\nfor personal services, to examine ways to reduce their number and\ncost. 9. Nothing in this Order\nshall: a. affect the validity of any contract\nentered into by any agency in a manner permissible by law; b. relieve any agency of any competitive\nbidding or other procurement requirements set forth in law or\nregulation; c. provide any legal\nright to any third party to enforce the terms of this order; d. apply to any contracts with another public\nentity, including a public authority, closely affiliated not-for-profit\norganization, or subdivision of the state; or\ne. affect, in any manner, the process by\nwhich the Office of the State Comptroller or Department of Law reviews state\ncontracts.
