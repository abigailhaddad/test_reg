Upon application made in accordance with the requirements of this\nsection, the Department of Law may, in its discretion, issue a \"no-action letter\" stating that it will not take any enforcement action because the\ntransaction described in the application occurs without the filing of an offering plan in compliance with section 352-e of the G.B.L.
