  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1628-6.1 - Disposal of excess equipment and supplies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Equipment and supplies which are no\nlonger needed or useful to the authority should be disposed of as quickly as\npossible. Disposal of items which had a unit cost of $50 or more at time of\npurchase will require the division's prior approval. (b) If possible, such equipment should be\nturned in on replacement equipment. Solicitation for bids for the replacement\nequipment should request bidders to offer a trade-in allowance for the old\nequipment. (c) If it is impossible\nto trade in the equipment or if it is more economical to purchase the new\nequipment without a trade-in, then the item should be disposed of by selling it\non a competitive basis to secondhand dealers. (d) If item can not be disposed of as\noutlined, then it should be considered scrap and sold on competitive basis to\nsalvage yards. If no offers are received for the scrap then it may be discarded\nby trash pick-up or taken to the municipal dump. A listing of items so disposed\nwill be certified to by the housing manager at the time of such\ndisposal. (e) Disposal of items\ncarried on inventory records will be entered on such records and reference\nnoted as to purchase order, cash receipt, or certification on which disposal\nwas effected. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1628-6.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
