The person who owns such fuel\nwhile it is held in the truck, vessel or other means of transportation at the\ntime of the commencement of off-loading of the fuel is the party responsible\nfor the payment of the prepaid tax. In addition, if the party off-loading the\nmotor fuel is not a registered distributor, the party owning the motor fuel\nafter it is off-loaded shall be the party responsible for payment of the\ntax.

(e) The prepaid tax described\nin this section shall be administered and collected in the same manner as the\nsales and compensating use taxes imposed under sections\n1105\nand\n1110\nof the\n\nTax Law.
