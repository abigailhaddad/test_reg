  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 136-2.7 - Implementation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Failure to implement provisions of applicable law or regulation shall be regarded as a breach of fiduciary responsibility. (b) The Comptroller, any officer or employee of OSC, or any other person or entity having a fiduciary responsibility to the fund, who willfully violates or knowingly participates in a violation of any fiduciary standard promulgated pursuant to section\n314\nof the Insurance Law or other applicable law or regulation, shall be guilty of a breach of fiduciary responsibility. (c) In the event the superintendent determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the breach has occurred, the superintendent shall, after providing notice to the Comptroller or his or her designee, and to the subject officer or employee of OSC or such other person or entity having a fiduciary responsibility to the fund, transmit a notice of reasonable cause to: the Temporary President of the Senate and the Speaker of the Assembly, if the notice relates to the Comptroller; or to the Comptroller, if the notice relates to an officer or employee of OSC or to any other person or entity having a fiduciary responsibility to the fund. (d) In any case where the superintendent determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that a breach by the Comptroller, an officer or employee of OSC, or any other person or entity having a fiduciary responsibility to the fund, has resulted in a depletion of the fund, the superintendent, after providing notice to the Comptroller or the Comptroller's designee, may transmit a copy of his or her determination to the Attorney General or any other appropriate civil or criminal law enforcement authorities for any appropriate further action. (e) In any case where the superintendent's transmittal results in an adjudication that the fund has been depleted by reason of any breach, the adjudication will be published on the OSC public website. (f) This Subpart shall take effect upon publication in the State Register, and will apply to all contracts related to the management of the fund entered into or renewed by the Comptroller subsequent to that date.
