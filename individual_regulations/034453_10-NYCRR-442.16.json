  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.16 - Pooled investments\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1360 ]\n(a) Investments of various funds may be pooled unless prohibited by law or the\nterms of a donation or grant. Gains/losses and investment income on pooled\ninvestments must be distributed to participating funds on a basis utilizing\nmarket value. (b) To illustrate the\nmarket value method of distributing gains/losses and income on pooled\ninvestments, assume the following facts: (1)\nA hospital decides to create a pool of investments from funds provided from the\nfollowing sources: Market value at inception of pool [FN*]\nAmount                     % of total pool\n\nUnrestricted fund                              $1,000,000                   20%\nEndowment Fund (single endowment)              $3,000,000                   60%\nPlant Replacement and Expansion                $1,000,000                   20%\n(PR&E) Fund\n$5,000,000                  100%\nFN* This serves as the initial distribution\nbasis. (2)\n\nGains/losses on\nthe Endowment Fund must be added to or deducted from the principal; however, the investment income is available for unrestricted purposes under the terms of\nthe gift. (3)\n\nGains/losses and\ninvestment income for the Plant Replacement and Expansion Fund must be added to\nor deducted from fund balance pursuant to the wishes of the donor. (4)\n\nThere were no gains/losses on the sale of\ninvestments for the first year the pool was in existence. The income generated\nby the pool for that year was $400,000. (5)\n\nAny gains on investment sales and\ninvestment income are not reinvested in the investment pool. The cash is\nremitted to funds that are entitled to the gains and/or income. (c) The distribution of the income\nfor the first year would be based on each participating fund's percentage of\nthe pool based on its contribution at market value at the initiation of the\npool. (1)\n\nTherefore, the distribution would\nbe as follows: Distributed to           Income distributed\n\nUnrestricted Fund  (total income of $400,000 x 20%)            $ 80,000\n\nEndowment Fund     (total income of $400,000 x 60%)             240,000\nPR&E Fund          (total income of $400,000 x 20%)              80,000\n$400,000\n(2)\n\nThe\naccounting entries necessary to account for the distribution of income from the\npooled investments would be as follows: Account    Dr. Cr. (i) Unrestricted Fund\n\nCash                                                    1010     $320,-\n000\n\nUnrestricted income from Endowment Fund (nonoperating   9050             $240,-\nrevenue)                                                                000\n\nIncome, gains and losses from unrestricted investments  9040             $ 80,-\n000\n\nTo record the income from pooled investments for the\nyear. (ii) PR&E Fund\n\nCash                                                    1510     $ 80,-\n000\n\nFund balance                                            2690             $ 80,-\n000\n\nTo record the income from pooled investments for the\nyear. (d) In\nthe second year the following facts are assumed: (1)\n\nOn the first day of the year the hospital\ndecided to add $1,000,000 of unrestricted funds to the pooled investments. On\nthat date, but prior to making the aforementioned addition, the pooled\ninvestments had the same cost, $5,000,000, as at inception, but a market value\nof $6,000,000. There were no other additions to the pool during this\nyear. (2)\n\nThere were net gains on\nthe sale of investments of $100,000 for the year and the investment income was\n$500,000 for the same period. (e) Based on the above facts, the\ndistribution percentage (%) for the income and gains on pooled investments for\neach of the participating funds would be based on the market value of the\ninvestment pool as of the date of the last addition and would be calculated as\nfollows: Revised distribution\nbasis\n\nUnits             % of\ntotal\nunits\n(1) Unrestricted Fund. Market Value $6,000,000 x 20% (distribution % prior to    $1,200,000\naddition)\n\nAddition to pool at fair value as of that date             1,000,000\n$2,200,000      31.4%\n(2) Endowment Fund. Market value $6,000,000 x 60% (distribution % prior to    $3,600,000      51.4%\naddition - no new additions)\n(3) PR&E Fund. Market Value $6,000,000 x 20% (distribution % prior to     1,200,000      17.2%\naddition - no new additions)\n$7,000,000     100.0%\n(f) The income\nand gains from pooled investments for the second year would be based on the\nnewly computed distribution and would be as follows: Current           Gains to be          Income to be\ndistribution %           distributed           distributed\n\nUnrestricted                  31.4%              $ 31,400              $157,000\n\nFund\n\nEndowment Fund                51.4%                51,400               257,000\nPR&E Fund                     17.2%                17,200                86,000\n100.0%              $100,000              $500,000\n(g) The\naccounting entries necessary to reflect the above distribution would be as\nfollows: (1) Unrestricted Fund. Account    Dr. Cr. Cash                                                    1010     $445,-\n400\n\nUnrestricted income from Endowment Fund (nonoperating   9050             $257,-\nrevenue)                                                                000\n\nIncome, gains and losses from unrestricted investments  9040             188,4-\n00\n\nTo record the income and gains on pooled investments\nattributable to these funds for the year. (2) Endowment Fund. Cash                                                    1810     $ 51,-\n400\n\nFund balance (gains on sales of investments)            2890             $ 51,-\n400\n\nTo record the gains on pooled investments attributable\nto this fund for the year. (3) PR&E Fund. Cash                                                    1510     $103,-\n200\n\nFund balance                                            2690             $103,-\n200\n\nTo record the gains and income on pooled investments\nattributable to this fund for the year. (h) As the above\nexample illustrates, each time an addition is made to the investment pool a new\ndistribution basis must be calculated. This is also true for any reductions to\nthe pool. All gains/losses and investment income from the beginning of the\naccounting period up to the date of the addition must be determined and\ndistributed on the basis of account balances prior to the addition. Any\ngains/losses and investment income subsequent to an addition would be\ndistributed on the new basis until another addition or reduction is\nmade. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
