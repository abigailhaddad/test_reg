  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 132.4 - Business, trade, profession or occupation carried on in New York State\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 632(b)(1)(B)\n(a) (1)\n\nThe\n\nNew York adjusted gross income of a nonresident individual includes items of\nincome, gain, loss and deduction entering into his Federal adjusted gross\nincome which are attributable to a business, trade, profession or occupation\ncarried on in New York State. (2)\nA\nbusiness, trade, profession or occupation\n(as distinguished\nfrom personal services as an employee) is carried on within New York State by a\nnonresident when such nonresident occupies, has, maintains or operates desk\nspace, an office, a shop, a store, a warehouse, a factory, an agency or other\nplace where such nonresident's affairs are systematically and regularly carried\non, notwithstanding the occasional consummation of isolated transactions\nwithout New York State. This definition is not exclusive. Business is carried\non within New York State if activities within New York State in connection with\nthe business are conducted in New York State with a fair measure of permanency\nand continuity. A taxpayer may enter into transactions for profit within New\n\nYork State and yet not be engaged in a trade or business within New York State. If a taxpayer pursues an undertaking continuously as one relying on the profit\ntherefrom for such taxpayer's income or part thereof, such taxpayer is carrying\non a business or occupation. However, see section\n132.10\nof this Part with regard to the effect of the purchase and sale of property by\na nonresident for such nonresident's own account. (b) The New York adjusted gross income of a\nnonresident individual rendering personal services as an employee includes the\ncompensation for personal services entering into his Federal adjusted gross\nincome, but only if, and to the extent that, his services were rendered within\n\nNew York State. Compensation for personal services rendered by a nonresident\nindividual wholly without New York State is not included in his New York\nadjusted gross income, regardless of the fact that payment may be made from a\npoint within New York State or that the employer is a resident individual, partnership or corporation. Where the personal services are performed within\nand without New York State, the portion of the compensation attributable to the\nservices performed within New York State must be determined in accordance with\nsections\n132.16\nthrough\n132.18\nof this Part. (c) If personal\nservices are performed within New York State, whether or not as an employee, the compensation for such services includible in Federal adjusted gross income\nconstitutes income from New York State sources, regardless of the fact that (1)\nsuch compensation is received in a taxable year after the year in which the\nservices were performed, or (2) such compensation is received by someone other\nthan the person who performed the services. (d) Pensions or other retirement\nbenefits constituting an annuity. (1)\n\nGeneral. Where an individual formerly employed in New York State\nis retired from service and thereafter receives a pension or other retirement\nbenefit attributable to his former services, the pension or retirement benefit\nis not taxable for New York State personal income tax purposes if the\nindividual receiving it is a nonresident and if it constitutes an\nannuity\nas defined in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. Where\na pension or other retirement benefit does not constitute an annuity, it is\ncompensation for personal services and, if the individual receiving it is a\nnonresident, it is taxable for New York State personal income tax purposes to\nthe extent that the services were performed in New York State. The term\ncompensation for personal services\nas used in the foregoing\nsentence includes, but is not limited to, amounts received in connection with\nthe termination of employment, amounts received upon early retirement in\nconsideration of past services rendered, amounts received upon retirement for\nconsultation services, and amounts received upon retirement under a covenant\nnot to compete. For allocation rules, see section\n132.20\nof this Part. (2)\n\nDefinition. To qualify as an\nannuity, a pension or\nother retirement benefit must meet the following requirements: (i) It must be paid in money only, not in\nsecurities of the employer or other property. (ii)\n\nIt must be payable at regular intervals, at least annually, for the life of the individual receiving it, or over a\nperiod not less than half of such individual's life expectancy as of the date\npayments begin. For payments which begin on or after July 1, 1987, an\nindividual's life expectancy is the expected return multiple shown for the\napplicable age in the table entitled \"Table V. Ordinary Life Annuities-One\n\nLife-Expected Return Multiples,\" promulgated under section 1.72 -9 of the\n\nFederal Income Tax Regulations (for payments which began before July 1, 1987, an individual's life expectancy is the expected return multiple shown for the\napplicable age and sex in the table entitled \"Table I. Ordinary Life\n\nAnnuities-One Life-Expected Return Multiples,\" promulgated under section 1.72\n-9 of the Federal Income Tax Regulations). (iii)\n\nIt must be payable: (a) at a rate which remains uniform during\nsuch life or period; or\n(b) at a\nrate which varies only with: (1)\nthe\nfluctuation in the market value of the assets from which such benefits are\npayable; (2)\nthe fluctuation in a\nspecified and generally recognized cost-of-living index; or\n(3)\nthe commencement of social security\nbenefits; or\n(c) in such\na manner that the total of the amounts payable is determinable at the annuity\nstarting date either directly from the terms of the contract or indirectly by\nthe use of either mortality tables or compound interest computations, or both, in conjunction with such terms and in accordance with sound actuarial theory. The term\nannuity starting date\nin the case of any contract or\nplan is the first day of the first period for which an amount is received as an\nannuity by the individual under the contract or plan. (iv)\n\nThe individual's right to receive it\nmust be evidenced by a written instrument executed by his employer, or by a\nplan established and maintained by the employer in the form of a definite\nwritten program communicated to his employees. (v) In the case of a pension or other similar\nbenefit paid to a nonresident beneficiary of a deceased employee: (a) where the employee died after retirement, if the pension or other retirement benefit he was receiving constituted an\nannuity, payments to his beneficiary, even though they do not meet the\nrequirements of subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, will\nconstitute an annuity; (b) if the\nemployee died before retirement, the pension or other benefit payable to his\nbeneficiary need not be payable for the life of such beneficiary or for a\nperiod measured by his or her life expectancy, provided that it is payable\npursuant to a plan established and maintained by the employer before the\nemployee's death, under which a pension or benefit meeting the requirements set\nforth in subparagraphs (i) through (iv) of this paragraph would have been\npayable to the employee upon his retirement. For the purposes of this clause, the employee's life expectancy is determined as of the date of his death if he\nwas then eligible for retirement under the terms of the plan; otherwise, his\nlife expectancy is determined as of the earliest date when he would have become\neligible for retirement under the plan. (e) Prizes, awards and\nsimilar payments. Prizes, awards and similar payments are derived from or\nconnected with New York State sources as long as they are incidental to the\nnonresident's presence or other activities in New York State.
