  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 145-1.11 - Duplicative awards\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn academic performance award may not be held\nconcurrently with such other State, Federal or other educational aid as is\ndetermined by the commissioner to duplicate the purposes of such award. An\nacademic performance award relinquished on this basis shall not subsequently be\nreinstated. (a) An educational grant\nor scholarship, by the Armed Forces of the United States or a Federal agency\nwhich provides tuition assistance, duplicates the purpose of an academic\nperformance award, except as provided in subdivisions (b), (d) and (e) of this\nsection. (b) The following shall\nnot be construed to duplicate the purposes of academic performance awards and\nmay be held concurrently with such awards: (1)\n\nUnited States War Orphans' Educational\n\nBenefits; (2)\nbenefits under the\n\nVeterans' Readjustment Act of 1966 (GI Bill); (3)\nbasic and supplemental educational\nopportunity grants; (4)\nspecial\nfinancial assistance for disadvantaged students; or\n(5)\n\nRobert C. Byrd Honors\n\nScholarships. (c) No\nperson shall receive benefits concurrently under the Lehman fellowship and\nunder any Federal or national fellowship. However, a student may receive Lehman\nfellowship benefits concurrently with a supplementary fellowship, grant, or\nassistance awarded by the college, even if funded under Federal contract, provided that the combined total of the benefits received by the student does\nnot exceed $5,000 a year plus tuition and fees. (d) The Carl D. Perkins scholarship shall not\nbe construed to duplicate the purpose of the Empire State Challenger\nundergraduate scholarships for teachers to the extent that the Empire State\n\nChallenger scholarship may be applied to tuition charges not covered by the\n\nCarl D. Perkins scholarship. Recipients of both awards shall satisfy the\nspecific conditions of both scholarship programs, including the respective\nteaching service obligations, provided that such teaching service obligations\nmay be satisfied concurrently. (e) An academic performance award not limited to tuition shall not be construed to\nduplicate, and may be held concurrently with, an educational grant or\nscholarship from the Armed Forces of the United States or a Federal agency\nprovided that the combined benefits do not exceed the student's full cost of\nattendance. Except as otherwise provided in article 14 of the Education Law, cost of attendance shall mean tuition, required fees, books, transportation, room and board. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
