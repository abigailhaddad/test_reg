Tit. 6 § 180.2 - Seizure of diseased native fish and feral animals\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When an environmental conservation\nofficer or other authorized employee of the department determines or has\nsubstantial reason to believe that a native fish or feral animal which has been\ntaken possesses an epizootic disease which endangers the health and welfare of\nnative fish or feral animal populations, he shall seize such native fish or\nferal animal in the public interest to prevent the development, spread or\nintroduction of such disease. (b) Upon the seizure of such native fish or feral animal, an environmental\nconservation officer or such authorized employee of the department shall issue\nto the taker of such native fish or feral animal a special permit to take\nanother specimen of the same species as that seized, provided such native fish\nor feral animal had been legally taken.
