  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 50.13 - Special precautions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No\nindividual shall look directly into a primary laser beam or directly at the\nspecular reflections of such a beam when the intensities of such beam or of\nsuch reflections are greater than those listed in Table 1 of this Part (rule), unless such individual is wearing approved eye protection in compliance with\nthe provisions of this Part (rule). (b) Every laser beam shall be terminated\nwhenever necessary by a material that is non-reflecting and fire-retardant. In\ncases of intentional beam interaction with targets, precautions shall be taken\nto prevent fires arising from flying particles. In cases of unavoidable\nreflections, precautions shall be taken to prevent the scatter of laser\nradiation in excess of the limits listed in this Part (rule) into uncontrolled\nareas. (c) Under circumstances\nwhere the conditions of laser operation can lead to accidental exposure to\nlaser radiation above the maximum permissible exposure limits as specified in\nthis Part (rule), an area shall be cleared of all individuals for a reasonable\ndistance on all sides of the anticipated path of the laser beam, except for\nthose individuals protected in compliance with the provisions of this Part\n(rule). (d) Special care shall be\ntaken to assure that approved safety eyewear is matched to the specific wave\nlength of the laser device with which it is to be used and that such eyewear\nprovides the required attenuation. (e) Any approved safety eyewear which has\nbeen exposed to high-intensity laser radiation shall not be reused until it has\nbeen reevaluated for shattering and effectiveness of its attenuation. (f) Laser beam paths shall be cleared of all\nmaterial or objects that may cause the scatter of laser radiation at levels in\nexcess of the limits listed in this Part (rule) into uncontrolled\nareas. (g) All unshielded lasers\nwhich are capable of emitting radiation above the maximum permissible exposure\nlimits as listed in this Part (rule) shall be capped or otherwise effectively\nterminated when not in operation. (h) Interlocks used on enclosures for\nhigh-intensity lasers shall not be used to actuate such lasers. (i) Any closed laser installation with one or\nmore access openings large enough for entry by individuals shall have at least\none such opening provided with an exit door which can be manually opened with\nease from inside the laser installation. (j) General illumination in laser radiation\nareas shall be at least 30 lumens per square foot, except where conditions of\nlaser operation require lower ambient illumination. (k) Electronic firing systems for pulsed\nlasers shall be so designed that accidental discharges of stored charges are\nprevented. (l) \"Fail-safe\" safety\ncircuitry shall be used with lasers wherever necessary. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n50.13\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
