Tit. 6 § 505.7 - Restrictions on regulated activities within structural hazard areas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Movable\nstructures may be constructed or placed within a structural hazard area only if\na coastal erosion management permit has been granted. Coastal erosion\nmanagement permit requirements include the following: (1)\n\nNo permanent foundation is attached to\nthe movable structure and any temporary foundations are removed at the time the\nstructure is moved. Below-grade footings will be allowed if satisfactory\nprovision is made for their removal. (2)\n\nNo movable structure may be placed closer\nto the landward limit of a bluff than 25 feet. (3)\n\nNo movable structure may be placed or\nconstructed so that, according to accepted engineering practice, its weight\nplaces an excessive ground loading on a bluff. (4)\nA plan for the landward relocation of a\nmovable structure, when threatened by shoreline recession, must be included\nwith each coastal erosion management permit application. (5)\n\nMovable structures, which have been\nlocated within an erosion hazard are pursuant to a coastal erosion management\npermit, must be removed before the receding edge recedes to within 10 feet of\nthe most seaward point of the movable structure. (6)\n\nDebris from structural damage which may\noccur as a result of sudden, unanticipated bluff-edge failure or erosion must\nbe removed within 60 days of the damaging event. (7)\n\nThe last owner of record, as shown on the\nlatest assessment roll, of real property upon which a movable structure is\nplaced is responsible for removing that structure and its foundation, unless\nthe last owner of record and the owner of the structure, if the structure is\nnot owned by the last owner of record, have made an agreement providing\notherwise in a form acceptable to the department. (b) The construction or placement of a\nnonmovable structure, or nonmovable major addition to an existing structure, is\nprohibited within structural hazard areas. (c) A coastal erosion management permit is\nrequired for the installation of public service distribution, transmission or\ncollection systems for gas, electricity, water or wastewater. Systems installed\nto serve coastline development along mainland shorelines must be located\nlandward of the shoreline structures being served. (d) Any grading, excavating, or other soil\ndisturbance conducted within a structural hazard area must not direct surface\nwater runoff over a bluff face. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n505.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
