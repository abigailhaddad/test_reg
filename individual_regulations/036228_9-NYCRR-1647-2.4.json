  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1647-2.4 - Computation and recording\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Accumulating the reserve. (1)\n\nThe\neffect of section\n1647-2.2\nis that the vacancy and\ncollection loss reserve will be increased at the end of every calendar quarter\nin which the sum of the actual dwelling vacancy losses incurred and collection\nlosses written off is\nless\nthan three per cent of the total\ndwelling rent schedule for the quarter, but no increase may be recorded which\nwill cause the reserve to exceed a maximum amount. Under this set of\ncircumstances, the following typical cases may arise: (i) There is an ample margin between the\namount accumulated in the V&C reserve to date and the maximum\nreserve. (ii)\n\nThe amount\naccumulated in the V&C reserve to date is close to the maximum\nreserve. (iii)\n\nThe maximum amount\nhas already been accumulated in the reserve. (2)\n\nThe computation of the amount to be set\naside in the reserve for a calendar quarter, hereinafter referred to as the\nprovision to be made for that quarter, for each of the three typical cases, is\nillustrated in Table I which follows. TABLE I\nComputation of Provision for V & C Losses\n\nActual Losses Are Less Than Three Per Cent of Total Dwelling Rent\n\nSchedule\n\nCase\n1\n\nItem\n\nReserve Less than\n\nMaximum (Ample Margin)\n\nReserve Less than\n\nMaximum (Small Margin)\n\nReserve is at\n\nMaximum\n1. Maximum amount of V&C Reserve, account\n2520\n$16,000\n$16,000\n$16,000\n2. Less: Balance of V&C Reserve at beginning\nof current quarter\n12,000\n15,850\n16,000\n3. Difference between items 1 and 2\n$4,000\n$150\nnone\n4. Total dwelling rent schedule for the current\nquarter\n$15,000\n$15,000\n$15,000\n5. Three per cent of item 4\n$450\n$450\n$450\n6. Less: Dwelling Vacancy Loss for the quarter, account 3111\n$150\n$150\n$150\n7. Less: Collection Loss for the quarter, account\n4770\n50\n50\n50\n8. Total losses for the quarter\n200\n200\n200\n9. Difference between items 5 and 8\n$250\n$250\n$250\n10. Provision to be made for V&C Losses for\nthe calendar quarter, item 3 or 9, whichever is less\n$250\n$150\nnone\n(i) The\nprovision (item 10 of the above table) is recorded on the books of account at\nthe end of the quarter by a journal voucher, as follows: Debit: Account 4895, Provision for Vacancy\nand Collection Losses... $XXX............................................................ Credit: Account 2520, Vacancy and\n\nCollection Loss Reserve... $XXX......................................................... (ii)\n\nNo journal entry would, of course, be\nmade for case 3 where the reserve at the beginning of the quarter was already\nat the maximum. (b) Drawing upon the reserve. (1)\n\nThe effect of section\n1647-2.3\nis that the vacancy and\ncollection loss reserve will be decreased at the end of every calendar quarter\nin which the sum of the actual dwelling vacancy losses incurred and collection\nlosses written off is\ngreater\nthan three per cent of the total\ndwelling rent schedule for the quarter, but no decrease may be recorded which\nwill cause the reserve account to show a debit balance. Under this set of\ncircumstances the following typical cases may arise: (i) The amount of the reserve is ample to\nabsorb the charge. (ii)\n\nThe amount\nof the reserve is not enough to absorb the charge. (iii)\n\nThe reserve has been\nexhausted. (2)\n\nThe\ncomputation of the amount to be drawn out of the reserve for a calendar quarter\nfor each of the three typical cases is illustrated in the following table. TABLE II\nComputation of Amount Deductible From V & C\nReserve Where Actual Losses Are Greater Than Three Per Cent of Total Dwelling\n\nRent Schedule\n\nCase\n1\n\nItem\n\nAmple\n\nReserve\n\nInadequate\n\nReserve\n\nReserve\n\nExhausted\n1. Balance of V&C Reserve at beginning of\ncurrent quarter\n$12,000\n$900\nnone\n2. Dwelling Vacancy Loss for the quarter, account\n3111\n$1,400\n$1,400\n$1,400\n3. Collection Losses for the quarter, account\n4770\n100\n100\n100\n4. Total Losses for the quarter\n$1,500\n$1,500\n$1,500\n5. Total dwelling rent schedule for the\nquarter\n$15,000\n$15,000\n$15,000\n6. Three per cent of item 5\n$450\n$450\n$450\n7. Difference between items 4 and 6\n$1,050\n$1,050\n$1,050\n8. Amount deductible from V&C Reserve, account 2520, for the current quarter, item 1 or item 7, whichever is less\n$1,050\n$900\nnone\n(i) The\namount by which the reserve is to be drawn upon (item 8 of the above table) is\nrecorded on the books of account at the end of the quarter by a journal\nvoucher, as follows: Debit: Account 2520, Vacancy and\n\nCollection Loss Reserve... $XXX.................................................. Credit: Account 4895, Provision for\n\nVacancy and Collection Losses... $XXX........................................ (ii)\n\nNo journal entry would, of course, be\nmade for case 3 where there was no reserve available at the beginning of the\nquarter, and the entry for case 2, where the reserve at the beginning of the\nquarter was inadequate, would result in a zero balance in account 2520, Vacancy\nand Collection Loss Reserve. (iii)\nA depleted reserve will be re-established in any quarter subsequent to\ndepletion in which three per cent of the total dwelling rent schedule for the\nquarter exceeds the actual vacancy loss incurred and collection losses written\noff.
