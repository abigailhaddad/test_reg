  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 256.8 - Standards for damaged food containers\n\nState Regulations\n\nAgriculture and Markets Law, § 18(2) and (6)\n(a) Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following terms shall\nhave the following meanings: (1)\n\nFlipper\nmeans a hermetically sealed container in which one end\nis slightly bulged and remains flat if pressed in. Flippers result from low\nvacuum. (2)\n\nLeaker\nmeans a faulty hermetically sealed container that allows its contents to leak\ndue to faulty seaming, rupture of the seal, industrial mishandling, severe\ndenting, holes that develop in the container, or pressure that develops within\nthe container. (3)\n\nSanitize\nmeans effective bactericidal treatment by a process\nthat has been approved by the department as being effective in destroying\nmicro-organisms, including pathogens. (4)\n\nSpringer\nmeans a\nhermetically sealed container with one end that bulges. When manual pressure is\napplied to the bulged end and released, either the opposite end is forced out\nor the bulged end springs back. If both ends of the container bulge, but only\none end remains flat when pressed, it is a springer. A springer results from\nthe presence of moderate positive pressure within the container. Bulging or\nextensive denting of the side walls may produce a springer. (5)\n\nSwell\nmeans a\nhermetically sealed container with two bulged ends. Neither end will remain\nflat without pressure. A soft swell will yield to manual pressure, but no\nimpression can be made manually on a hard swell. A swell results from positive\npressure in the container, usually due to the spoilage of its contents. Some\nswells, especially in acidic products, may result from a chemical reaction\nbetween the contents and the container. (b) Damaged food containers unsuitable\nfor sale or donation. No person shall possess, sell, offer, or expose for sale or\ndonate the following damaged food containers: (1)\nany can or jar with bulged ends, or any\ncontainer that is a swell, springer or flipper, including cans with bulged lids\ncaused by severe dents; provided, however, that this prohibition shall not\napply to beer or carbonated beverage containers that are slightly bulged due to\ngas, or to pressurized food containers such as coffee or cheese\nspreads; (2)\nany hermetically\nsealed can, jar or container that exhibits visible evidence of product\nleakage; (3)\nany pull-up, pull-ring, pull-tab or pull-top container that exhibits obvious fractures of\nthe lip scorelines, or any glass container that exhibits evidence of a\nloosening or opening of the closure or evidence of any other condition\naffecting the integrity of the seal; (4)\nany badly rusted and/or severely pitted\ncontainer that cannot be properly cleaned and reconditioned by moderate\nbuffing, by means other than the use of steel wire brushes which are prohibited\nand may not be used for this purpose. Fine brass or copper wire brushes may be\nused for moderate buffing; (5)\nany\nseverely dented can in which the end seam is pulled out of position to such an\nextent that the malposition is readily noticeable and in which there is\nevidence that the end seam may have been placed under tension; provided, however, that this prohibition shall not apply to food containers that exhibit\nmoderately deep, sharp, angular indentations and moderately acute crimping of\nthe body wall in which the end seam malposition is so slight that it can only\nbe detected by the use of a straight edge on a flat surface; (6)\nany severely dented can that exhibits\ndeep, sharp, angular dents and acute crimping of the body wall; provided, however, that this prohibition shall not apply to food containers that exhibit\nmoderately deep, angular indentations and moderately acute crimping of the body\nwall; (7)\nany severely dented can\nin which the end seam has been forced out of position to such an extent that\nthe countersink has been buckled, materially affecting the safety and viability\nof the container; provided, however, that this prohibition shall not include\nfood containers that exhibit body dents that force the end seam inward to such\nan extent that the countersink is involved, but no sharp edges are\nevident; (8)\nany container that\nexhibits an improper end seam closure whereby a portion of the cover or body\nflange has not been tucked properly into the end seam; (9)\nany container exhibiting deep, sharp, vertical side rim dents on the double seam in which the continuity of the seam\nis disrupted, or a rise is noted in the end plate at the site of the rupture; provided, however, that this prohibition shall not include food containers\nexhibiting deep, sharp, vertical or side rim dents that are not severe enough\nto cause the lid to buckle or bulge noticeably; (10)\nany container that is not properly\nlabeled within the meaning of the Agriculture and Markets Law of the State of\n\nNew York or that has lost its identity and cannot be properly re-identified. All salvaged foods and food products in containers shall be provided with\nlabels meeting the requirements of section\n201\nof the Agriculture and Markets Law. If original labels have been lost or\nremoved from containers that are to be resold, food salvager replacement labels\nshall be affixed to each container. Said labels shall, in addition to meeting\nthe requirements of Agriculture and Markets Law section 201, include the name\nand address of the food salvager as the distributor; (11)\nany paper, plastic or similar food\ncontainer or wrapping that has been damaged by penetration to such an extent\nthat the product contained therein may have been contaminated or adulterated; provided, however, that this prohibition shall not include any paper, plastic\nor similar food container or wrapping, that contains only slight damage, such\nas crushing and in which there is no evidence of penetration of the interior of\nthe container or of exposure of the foods contained therein; and\n(12)\nany container, including one having a\npress or screw cap, that has been totally immersed in water as the result of\nfire, flood or similar mishap; provided, however, that this prohibition shall\nnot apply to metal cans or tins of food that have been partially or totally\nsubmerged in water as the result of fire, flood or similar mishap and that have\nbeen thoroughly cleaned and sanitized with a rinse of a concentration of 100\np.p.m. available chlorine for a minimum period of one minute, or immersed in\nboiling water for five minutes followed by cooling to 95° F. and thorough\ndrying, or by any other method approved by the department, and that have been\nsubsequently treated to inhibit rust formation.
