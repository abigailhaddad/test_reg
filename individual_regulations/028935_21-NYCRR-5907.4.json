  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 5907.4 - Prompt payment procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\ncontractor shall request payment under a contract by submitting a proper\ninvoice to the foundation at its designated payment office at the time and in\nthe manner specified in the contract. (b) The foundation shall have 15 calendar\ndays after receipt of a proper invoice at its designated payment office to\nnotify the contractor of certain facts and conditions, including but not\nlimited to those listed below, which in the opinion of the foundation, justify\na delay of the prompt payment: (1)\nthere is a\ndefect in the delivered goods, property or services; (2)\nthere is a defect in the\ninvoice; (3)\nthere are suspected\nimproprieties of any kind; (4)\nprior to payment a statutory or contractual provision requires an inspection\nperiod or an audit to determine the resources applied or used by the contractor\nin fulfilling the contract terms; (5)\na proper invoice must be examined by the\n\nFederal government prior to payment; (6)\nthe foundation is prevented from making\npayment by reason of the existence of a lien attachment, or other legal\nrestriction; (7)\nthe necessary\n\nState government appropriation required to authorize payment has yet to be\nenacted; or\n(8)\nthe contractor has\nfailed to submit a proper invoice or other material in accordance with the\nterms of the contract. Any time taken to satisfy or rectify any of the above\nfacts or conditions or any delay in submission of required material shall\nextend the date by which prompt payment must be made by an equal period of\ntime. (c) Should the\nfoundation fail to notify a contractor of such facts and conditions within 15\ncalendar days of the receipt of an invoice, the number of days allowed for\npayment of the corrected proper invoice will be reduced by the number of days\nbetween the 15th day and the day that notification was transmitted to the\ncontractor. Should the foundation, in such situations, fail to provide\nreasonable grounds for its contention that a fact or condition justifying a\ntime extension exists, the date by which contract payment must be made in order\nfor the foundation not to become liable for interest payments shall be\ncalculated from the invoice received date. (d) The foundation shall make payment on a\nproper invoice within 30 calendar days after receipt of the proper invoice, excluding legal holidays. (e) Except\nfor payments described in subdivision (b) of this section and section\n5907.5\nof this Part, every payment\nby the foundation to a contractor pursuant to a proper invoice is eligible for\ninterest should the foundation fail to make such payment within 30 days after\nthe receipt of the proper invoice, excluding legal holidays. (f) The foundation shall not be liable for\ninterest on any retention amounts withheld by the foundation in accordance with\nthe terms of the contract. (g) Interest shall be computed at the rate set by the State Tax Commission for\ncorporate taxes pursuant to paragraph 1 of subsection (e) of section\n1096\nof the Tax Law. (h) The foundation has available funds in its\ncustody to pay all interest penalties. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
