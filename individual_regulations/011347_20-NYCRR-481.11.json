  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 481.11 - Taxable miles\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 501(6)\n(a) The tax under either the gross weight\nmethod or unloaded weight method is based on the number of miles the motor\nvehicle is operated on the public highways in this State. As noted in section\n470.1, public highway\nincludes any public highway, street, avenue, road, public place, public driveway or any other public way. If part of the\nmileage of any motor vehicle is outside the boundaries of this State that\nportion of the mileage is not considered in computing the tax. Example: If a motor vehicle travels 150 miles in New York State, 100 miles in New Jersey and then returns to New York State where it operates\nfor 15 miles, the mileage in New Jersey is not considered in computing the tax. The tax is based only on the 165 miles traveled in this State. (b) The statute specifically exempts mileage\non the New York State Thruway, provided a fee, rental or charge is made\ntherefor. Miles traveled upon portions of such Thruway, for which no such\ncharge is made, are required to be included in taxable miles. There is no\nexemption for mileage on any other toll road, tunnel or bridge. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n481.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
