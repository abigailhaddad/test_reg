  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.457 - External corrosion control: buried or submerged pipelines installed before august 1, 1971\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except for\nburied piping at compressor, regulator, and measuring stations, each buried or\nsubmerged transmission line, or distribution main to be operated at a pressure\nof 125 psig (862 kPa) or more in a Class 3 or 4 location, installed before\n\nAugust 1, 1971, that has an effective external coating must be cathodically\nprotected along the entire area that is effectively coated. For the purposes of\nthis Part, a pipeline does not have an effective external coating if its\ncathodic protection current requirements are substantially the same as if it\nwere bare. The operator shall make tests to determine the cathodic protection\ncurrent requirements. (b) Except\nfor cast iron or ductile iron, each of the following buried or submerged\npipelines installed before August 1, 1971, must be cathodically protected or\nreplaced in the areas in which active corrosion is found: (1)\nbare or ineffectively coated transmission\nlines; (2)\nbare or coated pipes at\ncompressor, regulator, and measuring stations; or\n(3)\nbare or coated distribution lines, except\ncoated distribution mains to be operated at a pressure of 125 psig (862 kPa) or\nmore in a Class 3 or 4 location. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.457\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
