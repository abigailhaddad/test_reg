  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 664.4 - Classification Procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ndepartment shall classify each jurisdictional wetland according to the\nclassification system set forth in section\n664.5\nof this Part. That system\nestablishes four separate classes that rank wetlands according to their ability\nto perform wetland functions and provide wetland benefits. Class I wetlands\nhave the highest rank, and the ranking descends through classes II, III and\nIV. (b) When a wetland contains\ncharacteristics of more than one class, the entire wetland shall be classified\nbased on the highest class identified. (c) Where a previously mapped wetland has\nbeen altered for agricultural purposes and therefore meets the exemption\npursuant to section 24-0701 of the Act, the land shall continue to be regulated\naccording to its original mapping designation once exempt agricultural\nactivities cease. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n664.4\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 31, 2024/Volume XLVI, Issue 53, eff. 1/1/2025\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. (a) The\ncommissioner\nshall classify each\nwetland\nshown on the\nfreshwater wetlands map\naccording to the\nclassification\nsystem set forth in section\n664.5\nof this Part. That system establishes four separate classes that rank\nwetlands\naccording to their ability to perform\nwetland\nfunctions and provide\nwetland\nbenefits. Class I\nwetlands\nhave the highest rank, and the ranking descends through classes II, III and IV. (b) When a\nwetland\ncontains characteristics of more than one class, the\nwetland\nshall be classified in the highest of the classes. (c) If irreversible degradation has removed the benefits associated with the particular characteristic(s) justifying a\nclassification, the\nwetland\nshall be classified on the basis of the remaining characteristics. For example, a\nwetland\ncould be irreversibly contaminated by toxic substances that remove its benefits as habitat for fish and wildlife, or could be irreversibly visually degraded, thus removing some or all of its aesthetic, recreational and open-space benefits. (d) Notwithstanding subdivision (c) of this section, where land originally designated as a\nwetland\non the\nmap\nwas altered for agricultural purposes following the promulgation of that\nmap, the land shall continue to be classified in light of its\nwetland\nconditions, and the\nwetland\nbenefits set forth in section 24-0105 of the\nact\nand in this Part that it provided, at the time of its original designation on the\nmap. (e) The\nclassification\nof each\nwetland\nshall be set forth in a written order by the\ncommissioner. An explanation of the reasons for the\nclassification\nshall be on file in the appropriate regional office(s) of the\ndepartment. A copy of the\nclassification\norder shall be filed in the office of the clerk of each\nlocal government\nin which the\nwetland\nis located and in the appropriate regional office(s) of the\ndepartment. Notice of each order shall also be given to the chief administrative officer of each affected\nlocal government\nand to each\nowner\nof record, as shown on the latest completed tax assessment rolls, of classified\nwetlands\naffected by the order, and also shall be published in the\ndepartment\n's environmental notice bulletin. (f) The\ncommissioner\nmay raise or lower a\nclassification\non the basis of material new information or materially changed\nwetland\nconditions. Notice of the order setting forth the revised\nclassification\nshall be given and published, and a copy of such order shall be filed, as provided in subdivision (e) of this section. (g) Any\nperson\nmay request of the\ndepartment\na change in a\nwetland\n's\nclassification\nby setting forth reasons for believing the present\nclassification\nto be incorrect. Such request shall be submitted in writing in a form and manner prescribed by the\ndepartment\nand shall set forth material new information relevant to the\nwetland\nor materially changed conditions of the\nwetland\njustifying the request. The request must include\nevidence\naddressed to the\nclassification\nsystem set forth in section\n664.5\nof this Part, consisting of, for example, photographs identifying cover types justifying a different\nclassification; water samples; or the affidavit of an expert. The\ndepartment\nshall notify the\nperson\nmaking the request within 15 working days as to whether the request is adequate to warrant consideration. If the\ndepartment\ndeems the request adequate, the decision to reclassify the\nwetland\nas requested, to retain the existing\nclassification, or to change the\nclassification\nto another\nclassification\nnot so requested shall continue to be at the discretion of the\ncommissioner. Notice of any order setting forth a revised\nclassification\nshall be given and published, and a copy of such order shall be filed, as provided in subdivision (e) of this section. (h) Any\nperson\nintending to submit an application for a\npermit\nor a\nletter of permission\nmay, in the course of a preapplication conference held pursuant to subdivision (b) of section\n663.4\nof this Title, or in the course of analogous discussions with a\nlocal government\nthat is administering the\nact, request in writing, in a form and manner prescribed by the\ndepartment, that the\ncommissioner\nconfirm the\nclassification\nof the\nwetland\nthat would be affected by the proposed activity. Within 15 working days of the\ndepartment\n's\nreceipt\nof the request, the\ncommissioner\nshall decide either to confirm the existing\nclassification\nor to revise (either to raise or lower) the\nclassification\non the basis of material new information or materially changed\nwetland\nconditions. Within that same 15-\nday\nperiod, the\ndepartment\nshall send notice of the decision confirming or revising the\nclassification\nto the\nperson\nwho submitted the request; and that\nperson\nshall not file a\npermit\napplication until such notice has been provided. Where the\nclassification\nis revised, notice of the order setting forth the revised\nclassification\nshall also be given and published, and a copy of such order shall be filed, as provided in subdivision (e) of this section. Once the\nwetland\n's\nclassification\nhas been confirmed or revised pursuant to this subdivision and the\npermit\napplication that was the subject of the preapplication conference has been filed, no further\ndepartment\n-initiated change in the\nwetland\n's\nclassification\nshall change the standard for\npermit\nissuance applied to that application. (i) If there is a public\nhearing\non a\npermit\napplication, then once that\nhearing\nhas commenced, no\ndepartment\n-initiated change in the\nwetland\n's\nclassification\nshall change the standard for\npermit\nissuance applied to that application. However, any other\nparty\nto such a\nhearing\nmay request a change in the existing\nclassification\nof that\nwetland\nin the same manner and under the same conditions as set forth in subdivision (g) of this section. Within five working days of its\nreceipt\nof the request, the\ndepartment\nmust determine whether the request is adequate to warrant consideration. If the\ndepartment\ndeems the request adequate, the\ncommissioner\nmust\nact\nupon the request; either to reclassify the\nwetland\nas requested, to retain the existing\nclassification, or to change the\nclassification\nto another\nclassification\nnot so requested; within 15 working days from the date of the request, and before the\npermit\nhearing\nmay continue.
