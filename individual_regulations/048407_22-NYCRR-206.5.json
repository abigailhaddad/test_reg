Thereafter such number and judge's name shall appear on the\noutside cover and first page to the right of the caption of every paper\ntendered for filing in the action. A small claim filed pursuant to article 6 of\nthe Eminent Domain Procedure Law shall be numbered in the same manner as other\nclaims except its number shall be followed by the suffix \"s.\" In addition to\ncomplying with the provisions of CPLR 2101, unless the court shall otherwise\npermit in the interest of justice, every paper filed in court shall have\nannexed thereto appropriate proof of service on all parties where required, and\nevery paper, other than an exhibit or printed form, shall contain writing on\none side only and if typewritten, shall have at least double space between each\nline, except quotations and the names and addresses of attorneys appearing in\nthe action, and shall have at least one-inch margins.

(e) Omission or Redaction of\n\nConfidential Personal Information. (1)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided by rule\nor law or court order, and whether or not a sealing order is or has been\nsought, the parties shall omit or redact confidential personal information in\npapers submitted to the court for filing. For purposes of this rule, confidential personal information (''CPI'') means: i. the taxpayer identification number of\nan individual or an entity, including a social security number, an employer\nidentification number, and an individual taxpayer identification number, except\nthe last four digits thereof; ii. the date of an individual's birth, except the year thereof; iii. the full name of an individual\nknown to be a l11inor, except the minor's initials; and\niv. a financial account number, including a credit and/or debit card number, a bank account number, an\ninvestment account number, and/or an insurance account number, except the last\nfour digits or let- ters thereof.

The court shall consider the pro se status of any party in\ngranting relief pursuant to this provision. (3)\n\nWhere a person submitting a paper to\na court for filing believes in good faith that the inclusion of the full\nconfidential personal information described in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision is material and necessary to the adjudication\nof the action or proceeding before the court, he or she may apply to the court\nfor leave to serve and file together with a paper in which such information has\nbeen set forth in abbreviated form a confidential affidavit or affirmation\nsetting forth the same information in unabbreviated form, appropriately\nreferenced to the page or pages of the paper at which the abbreviated form\nappears. e\n(f) At the direction of\nthe court, a party shall provide a courtesy copy of any paper to\nchambers.
