Tit. 6 § 372.2 - Standards applicable to generators of hazardous waste\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following requirements are applicable to generators of\nhazardous waste unless specifically exempted or modified elsewhere in this\n\nPart. (a) General\nrequirements. (1)\n\nWithin 90 days after\npromulgation or revision of Part 371 of this Title, any person generating\nwastes not previously regulated as hazardous waste must file with the\ncommissioner a notification stating location and general description of the\nactivity responsible for the generation of the waste and the hazardous wastes\nhandled by such person. No hazardous waste subject to the regulations in this\n\nTitle may be transported, treated, stored or disposed of unless the department\nhas been notified of these activities as required in this section or as\nrequired under Part 373 of this Title before the effective date of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nHazardous waste\ndetermination. A person who generates a solid waste must determine if that\nwaste is a hazardous waste using the following method: (i) First determine if the waste is excluded\nfrom regulation under section\n371.1\n(e), exclusions, of this Title. (ii)\n\nThen determine if the waste is listed as a hazardous waste in section\n371.4\nof this Title. Note: Even if the waste is listed, the generator still has an\nopportunity under section\n370.3\n(c) of this\n\nTitle to demonstrate that the waste from his particular facility or operation\nis not a hazardous waste. (iii)\n\nFor purposes of compliance with Part\n376 of this Title or if the waste is not listed as a hazardous waste in section\n371.4\nof this Title, the generator\nmust then determine whether the waste is identified in section\n371.3\nof this Title by either: (a) testing the waste according to the\nmethods set forth in Appendix 19, 20 or 21, infra, or\naccording to an equivalent method approved under section\n370.3\n(b) of this\n\nTitle; or\n(b) applying knowledge of\nthe hazard characteristic of the waste in light of the materials or the\nprocesses used; (iv)\nif\nthe waste is determined to be hazardous, the generator must refer to Parts 370\nthrough 374 and 376 of this Title, for possible exclusions or restrictions\npertaining to management of the specific waste. Hazardous waste annual\nreporting requirements are set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Hazardous waste annual reports must also be filed by facilities subject to ECL\nsection 72-0402. (3)\nEPA identification numbers. (i) A generator\nmust not treat, store, dispose of, transport or offer for transportation, hazardous waste without having received an EPA identification number as defined\nin section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (To obtain an EPA identification number, use the Notification of\n\nRegulated Waste Activity form [EPA Form 8700-12], available at\nhttp://www.epa.gov.)\n(ii)\nA\ngenerator must not offer hazardous waste to transporters or to treatment, storage or disposal facilities that have not received an EPA identification\nnumber. (4)\n\nPackaging. Before transporting hazardous waste or offering waste for transportation\noffsite, a generator must package the waste in accordance with the applicable\nU.S. Department of Transportation regulations on packaging set forth in 49 CFR\nparts\n173, 178\nand\n179\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle).

Mail the department copy to: New York State Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation, Division of Solid & Hazardous Materials, Manifest Section, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233-7252. Manifest copies do not\nneed to be distributed to states other than New York, if those states do not\nrequire such a copy be submitted to them. (b) Manifest requirements. (1)\nA\ngenerator who transports, or offers for transport a hazardous waste for offsite\ntreatment, storage, or disposal, or a treatment, storage, and disposal facility\nwho offers for transport a rejected hazardous waste load, must prepare a\nmanifest on EPA form 8700-22, and if necessary, EPA form 8700-22A, according to\nthe manifest instructions included in Appendix 30 of this Title. (i) For shipments of hazardous waste to a\ndesignated facility in an authorized state which has not yet obtained\nauthorization to regulate that particular waste as hazardous, the generator\nmust assure that the designated facility agrees to sign and return the manifest\nto the generator, and that any out-of-state transporter signs and forwards the\nmanifest to the designated facility. (2)\n\nPrior to shipment of hazardous waste off\nthe site at which such waste was generated, the generator must: (i) designate on the manifest one facility\nwhich is authorized to handle the waste described on the manifest. A generator\nmay also designate on the manifest one alternate facility which is authorized\nto handle the waste in the event an emergency prevents delivery of the waste to\nthe primary designated facility. The generator must confirm by written\ncommunication from the designated treatment, storage or disposal facility and\nalternate treatment, storage or disposal facility that it is authorized to\nhandle the particular hazardous waste described on the manifest; (ii)\nfor each hazardous waste listed in item\n9 of the manifest, confirm with the designated facility what the ultimate\ndisposal method will be for that waste. If the receiving TSD facility is not\nproviding a hazardous waste management code in item 19 that reflects the\nultimate disposal method for the hazardous waste, the generator must provide a\n\nState waste code in item 13 of the manifest to designate the ultimate disposal\nmethod of the hazardous waste using one of the following State codes: L = Landfill\nB = Incineration, heat recovery, burning\nT = Chemical, physical, or biological treatment\nR = Material recovery of more than 75 percent of the total\nmaterial. If the receiving TSD facility uses hazardous waste report\nmanagement method code for \"storage, bulking, and/or transfer off-site - no\ntreatment/recovery, fuel blending, or disposal at this site\" in item 19 of the\nmanifest form, and the generator has failed to provide the ultimate disposal\nmethod in item 13, the ultimate disposal method is deemed landfill\n(L); (iii)\nconfirm by\nwritten communication from the designated transporter(s) that they are\nauthorized to deliver the manifested waste to the designated treatment, storage\nor disposal facility; and\n(iv)\ninstruct the transporter that, if an emergency arises which prevents delivery\nto the designated facility or the alternate facility, the transporter must\ncontact the generator for further directions concerning the disposition of the\nwaste. The generator will then either designate another facility or instruct\nthe transporter to return the waste. (3)\n\nThe generator must: (i) sign the manifest certification by hand; and\n(ii)\nobtain the handwritten\nsignature of the initial transporter and date of acceptance on the manifest; and\n(iii)\nretain one copy of the\nmanifest in accordance with subparagraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, and mail\nonly copy of the manifest form to the generator state and mail only copy of the\nmanifest form to the destination state (if different from the generator state), making legible photocopies as necessary, postmarked within 10 calendar days of\nshipment date. Mail the department copy to: New York State Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation, Division of Materials Management, Waste Transport\nand State Assistance Section, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233-7252. Generators\ndo not need to distribute manifest copies to states other than New York, if\nthose states do not require such a copy be submitted to them. The generator\nmust give the transporter the remaining copies of the manifest. (iv)\nfor rejected shipments of hazardous\nwaste or container residues contained in non-empty containers that are returned\nto the generator by the designated facility (following the procedures of\nsections\n373-2.5\n(b)(1)(v)\nor\n373-3.5\n(b)(1)(v)\nof this Title), the generator must: (a) sign\neither: (1)\nitem 20 of the new manifest if a\nnew manifest is used for the returned shipment; or\n(2)\nitem 18c of the original manifest if the\noriginal manifest is used for the returned shipment; (b) provide the transporter a copy of the\nmanifest; (c) within 10 days of\ndelivery of the rejected shipment or container residues contained in non-empty\ncontainers, send a copy of the manifest to the designated facility that\nreturned the shipment to the generator and send one copy of the manifest form\nto the generator State and send one copy of the manifest form to the\ndestination state (if different from the generator State), making legible\nphotocopies as necessary. Send the Department copy to: New York State\n\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233-7252. Generators do not need to distribute manifest copies to states other than New\n\nYork if those states do not require such a copy be submitted to them; and\n(d) retain at the generator's\nsite a copy of each manifest for at least three years from the date of\ndelivery. (4)\n\nSpecial conditions. In the following situations, generator manifest\nrequirements are modified as follows: (i) Generators who offer hazardous waste for shipment to a destination outside the\n\nUnited States must comply with the generator requirements of section\n372.5\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nGenerators who offer hazardous waste for\nshipment to a destination outside New York State must comply with the generator\nrequirements of section\n372.6\nof this Part. (iii)\n\nGenerators who employ one or more rail\nor water (bulk) transporters to ship their hazardous waste must comply with the\ngenerator requirements of section\n372.7\nof this Part. (5)\n\nNo generator may: (i) offer a shipment of hazardous waste for\ntransport off-site without an accompanying manifest; (ii)\noffer a shipment of hazardous waste to a\ntransporter unless: (a) such transporter has\na valid permit, issued under Part 364 of this Title, which authorizes the\ntransporter to transport the particular waste(s) offered for shipment to the\ndesignated facility; or\n(b) the\ntransporter is otherwise exempt from the permit requirements of Part 364 of\nthis Title; or\n(iii)\noffer for shipment or ship a hazardous waste to other than an authorized\nfacility. (6)\n\nUse of a\n\nNew York State or EPA hazardous waste code on a manifest constitutes a\ndetermination by the generator that the solid waste is a hazardous waste in New\n\nYork. (7)\n\nThe requirements of this\nsection (manifest requirements) do not apply to hazardous waste produced by\ngenerators of greater than 100 kilograms but less than 1,000 kilograms per\ncalendar month where: (i) the waste is\nreclaimed under a contractual agreement pursuant to which: (a) the type of waste and frequency of\nshipments are specified in the agreement; (b) the vehicle used to transport the waste\nto the recycling facility and to deliver regenerated material back to the\ngenerator is owned and operated by the reclaimer; (c) the reclaimer complies with any\napplicable Part 364 waste hauler permit requirements; and\n(ii)\nthe generator records the following\ninformation for each shipment: (a) the\nhazardous waste code and quantity of waste shipped; and\n(b) the date the waste is shipped; and\n(iii)\nthe generator\nmaintains a copy of the reclamation agreement on file for a period of at least\nthree years after termination or expiration of the agreement. (8)\n\nThe requirements of this\nsection and subparagraph (a)(6)(ii) of this section do not apply to the\ntransport of hazardous wastes on a public or private right-of-way within or\nalong the border of contiguous property under the control of the same person, even if such contiguous property is divided by a public or private\nright-of-way. The generator or transporter must comply with the requirements\nfor transporters set forth in section\n372.3\n(d) of this\n\nPart in the event of a discharge of hazardous waste on a public or private\nright-of-way. (9)\n\nManifest tracking\nnumbers, manifest printing and obtaining manifests. 40\nCFR section\n262.21, manifest tracking\nnumbers, manifest printing, and obtaining manifests, as published in the 70 FR\n10775, et seq. - Federal Register, March 4, 2005, is\nincorporated by reference as if fully set forth herein (see section\n370.1\n[e][3]\nof\nthis Title). (10)\n\nWaste\nminimization certification. A generator who initiates a shipment of hazardous\nwaste must certify to one of the following statements in item 15 of the uniform\nhazardous waste manifest: (i) \"I am a large\nquantity generator. I have a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity\nof waste generated to the degree I have determined to be economically\npracticable and I have selected the practicable method of treatment, storage, or disposal currently available to me which minimizes the present and future\nthreat to human health and the environment;\" This statement can also be found\nat\n40 CFR\n262.27(a), as incorporated\nby reference (see section 370.1[e] of this Title); or\n(ii)\n\"I am a small quantity generator.

(i) One time per 12-month period for each\nlaboratory, an eligible academic entity may opt to conduct a laboratory\nclean-out that is subject to all the applicable requirements of this\nsubdivision, except that: (a) if the volume\nof unwanted material in the laboratory exceeds 55 gallons (or one quart of\nliquid reactive acutely hazardous unwanted material, one quart of containerized\ngas reactive acutely hazardous unwanted material, or one kilograms of solid\nreactive acutely hazardous unwanted material), the eligible academic entity\nmust remove all unwanted materials from the laboratory within 30 calendar days\nfrom the start of the laboratory clean-out; and\n(b) for the purposes of on-site accumulation, an eligible academic entity is not required to count a hazardous waste that is\nan unused commercial chemical product (listed in section\n371.4\nof this Title or exhibiting\none or more characteristics of section\n371.3\nof this Title) generated\nsolely during the laboratory clean-out toward its hazardous waste generator\nstatus, pursuant to section\n371.1\n(f)(3) and\n(4)\nof this Title. However, an unwanted\nmaterial that was accumulated prior to the beginning of the laboratory\nclean-out and is still in the laboratory at the time the laboratory clean-out\ncommences must be counted toward hazardous waste generator status, pursuant to\nsection\n371.1\n(f)(3) and\n(4)\nof this Title, if it is determined to be\nhazardous waste; and\n(c) for the\npurposes of off-site management, an eligible academic entity must count all its\nhazardous waste, regardless of whether the hazardous waste was counted toward\ngenerator status under clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph, and if\nit generates more than one kilograms/month of acute hazardous waste or more\nthan 100 kilograms/month of hazardous waste (\ni.e., the\nconditionally exempt small quantity generator limits of section\n371.1\n[f]\nof this\n\nTitle), the hazardous waste is subject to all applicable hazardous waste\nregulations when it is transported off-site; and\n(d) an eligible academic entity must document\nthe activities of the laboratory clean-out. The documentation must, at a\nminimum, identify the laboratory being cleaned out, the date the laboratory\nclean-out begins and ends, and the volume of hazardous waste generated during\nthe laboratory clean-out. The eligible academic entity must maintain the\nrecords for a period of three years from the date the clean-out ends; and\n(ii)\n\nFor all other\nlaboratory clean-outs conducted during the same 12-month period, an eligible\nacademic entity is subject to all the applicable requirements of this\nsubdivision, including, but not limited to: (a) The requirement to remove all unwanted\nmaterials from the laboratory within 10 calendar days of exceeding 55 gallons\n(or one quart of liquid reactive acutely hazardous unwanted material, one quart\nof containerized gas reactive acutely hazardous unwanted material, or one\nkilogram of solid reactive acutely hazardous unwanted material), as required by\nparagraph (9) of this subdivision; and\n(b) The requirement to count all hazardous\nwaste, including unused hazardous waste, generated during the laboratory\nclean-out toward its hazardous waste generator status, pursuant to section\n371.1\n(f)(3) and\n(4)\nof this Title. (15)\n\nLaboratory management plan. An eligible academic entity must develop and retain a written Laboratory\n\nManagement Plan, or revise an existing written plan. The Laboratory Management\n\nPlan is a site-specific document that describes how the eligible academic\nentity will manage unwanted materials in compliance with this subdivision. An\neligible academic entity may write one Laboratory Management Plan for all the\nlaboratories owned by the eligible academic entity that have opted into this\nsubdivision, even if the laboratories are located at sites with different EPA\nIdentification Numbers. The Laboratory Management Plan must contain two parts\nwith a total of nine elements identified in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph. In Part I of its Laboratory Management Plan, an eligible academic\nentity must describe its procedures for each of the elements listed in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph. An eligible academic entity must implement\nand comply with the specific provisions that it develops to address the\nelements in Part I of the Laboratory Management Plan. In Part II of its\n\nLaboratory Management Plan, an eligible academic entity must describe its best\nmanagement practices for each of the elements listed in subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph. The specific actions taken by an eligible academic entity to\nimplement each element in Part II of its Laboratory Management Plan may vary\nfrom the procedures described in the eligible academic entity's Laboratory\n\nManagement Plan, without constituting a violation of this subdivision. An\neligible academic entity may include additional elements and best management\npractices in Part II of its Laboratory Management Plan if it chooses. (i) The eligible academic entity must\nimplement and comply with the specific provisions of Part I of its Laboratory\n\nManagement Plan. In Part I of its Laboratory Management Plan, an eligible\nacademic entity must: (a) Describe procedures\nfor container labeling in accordance with subparagraph (7)(i), as follows: (1)\n\nIdentifying whether the eligible academic\nentity will use the term \"unwanted material\" on the containers in the\nlaboratory. If not, identify an equally effective term that will be used in\nlieu of \"unwanted material\" and consistently by the eligible academic entity in\nlieu of \"unwanted material.\" The equally effective term, if used, has the same\nmeaning and is subject to the same requirements as \"unwanted\nmaterial.\"\n(2)\n\nIdentifying the\nmanner in which information that is \"associated with the container\" will be\nimparted. (b) Identify\nwhether the eligible academic entity will comply with clauses\n(9)(i)(\na\n) or (\nb\n) of this subdivision, for\nregularly scheduled removals of unwanted material from the\nlaboratory. (ii)\n\nIn Part\nII of its Laboratory Management Plan, an eligible academic entity must: (a) Describe its intended best practices for\ncontainer labeling and management (see the required standards at paragraph [7]\nof this subdivision). (b) Describe\nits intended best practices for providing training for laboratory workers and\nstudents commensurate with their duties (see the required standards at\nsubparagraph [8][i] of this subdivision).

(2)\n\nFor removals when maximum volumes are\nexceeded: (i) Describe its intended best\npractices for removing unwanted materials from the laboratory within 10\ncalendar days when unwanted materials have exceeded their maximum volumes (see\nthe required standards at subparagraph [9][iv] of this subdivision). (ii)\n\nDescribe its intended best practices for\ncommunicating that unwanted materials have exceeded their maximum\nvolumes. (e) Describe its intended best practices for making hazardous waste determinations, including specifying the duties of the individuals involved in the process (see\nthe required standards at paragraphs [a][2] of this section and paragraphs [10]\nthrough [13] of this subdivision). (f) Describe its intended best practices for\nlaboratory clean-outs, if the eligible academic entity plans to use the\nincentives for laboratory clean-outs provided in paragraph (14) of this\nsubdivision, including: (1)\nprocedures for\nconducting laboratory clean-outs (see the required standards at clauses\n(14)(i)(\na\n) through (\nc\n) of this subdivision); and\n(2)\nprocedures for documenting\nlaboratory clean-outs (see the required standards at clause\n[14][i][\nd\n] of this subdivision). (g) Describe its intended best practices for\nemergency prevention, including: (1)\nprocedures for emergency prevention, notification, and response, appropriate to\nthe hazards in the laboratory; and\n(2)\na list of chemicals that the eligible\nacademic entity has, or is likely to have, that become more dangerous when they\nexceed their expiration date and/or as they degrade; and\n(3)\nprocedures to safely dispose of chemicals\nthat become more dangerous when they exceed their expiration date and/or as\nthey degrade; and\n(4)\nprocedures\nfor the timely characterization of unknown chemicals. (iii)\n\nAn eligible academic entity\nmust make its Laboratory Management Plan available to laboratory workers, students, or any others at the eligible academic entity who request\nit. (iv)\n\nAn eligible academic\nentity must review and revise its Laboratory Management Plan, as needed, but at\na minimum, every five years. (16)\n\nUnwanted material that is not solid or\nhazardous waste. (i) If an unwanted material\ndoes not meet the definition of solid waste in section\n371.1\n(c) of this\n\nTitle, it is no longer subject to this subdivision or to the Parts 370 through\n374 and 376 hazardous waste regulations of this Title. (ii)\n\nIf an unwanted material does not meet\nthe definition of hazardous waste in section\n371.1\n(d) of this\n\nTitle, it is no longer subject to this subdivision or to the Parts 370 through\n374 and 376 hazardous waste regulations of this Title, but must be managed in\ncompliance with any other applicable regulations and/or conditions. (17)\n\nNon-laboratory hazardous\nwaste generated at an eligible academic entity. An eligible academic entity that generates hazardous waste\noutside of a laboratory is not eligible to manage that hazardous waste under\nthis subdivision; and\n(i) remains\nsubject to the generator requirements of paragraph (a)(2) and clause\n(a)(8)(i)(\na\n) of this section, for large quantity generators\nand small quantity generators (if the hazardous waste is managed in a satellite\naccumulation area), and all other applicable generator requirements of this\n\nPart, with respect to that hazardous waste; or\n(ii)\nremains subject to the conditional\nexemption of section\n371.1\n(f)(2)\nof\nthis Title, for conditionally exempt small quantity generators, with respect to\nthat hazardous waste.
