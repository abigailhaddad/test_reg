  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 501.1 - Purpose and scope\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Public\nunderstanding of the process of government decisionmaking is essential to a\nfree and democratic society. That understanding is enhanced by providing\nmaximum public access to the documents and data upon which government policy is\nmade. Accordingly, the authority's policy with respect to requests for its\nrecords is that disclosure is the rule and withholding is the exception. All\nrecords not exempt from disclosure will be made available. Moreover, records\nwhich may be exempt from disclosure will be made available as a matter of\ndiscretion when disclosure is not prohibited by law, or is not harmful to the\npublic interest. (b) This Part\nprovides information concerning the procedures by which records may be\nrequested, reviewed and obtained. (c) Any conflicts among laws governing public\naccess to records shall be construed in favor of the widest possible\navailability of public records. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n501.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
