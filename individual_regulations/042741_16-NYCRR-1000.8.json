  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1000.8 - Water quality and coastal certification procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In accordance with section 401 of the\n\nClean Water Act, if construction or operation of a proposed major electric\ngenerating facility, its interconnections, or related facilities would result\nin any discharge into the navigable water of the United States and require a\n\nFederal license or permit, the applicant is required to request and obtain a\nwater quality certification indicating that the proposed activity will be in\ncompliance with water quality standards. (1)\n\nGenerally, the request for the water quality certification shall be submitted\naccompanying the article 10 application. However, in the event the related\napplication for a Federal license or permit has not been submitted on or before\nthe date of submission of the article 10 application, the request for the water\nquality certification shall be submitted to the board when an application for a\n\nFederal license or permit is made. If the request does not accompany the\narticle 10 application, the applicant shall provide a statement describing its\nplan for making such a request, including a timetable. (2)\nA copy of all pertinent State and Federal\npermit applications related to the water quality certification shall be\nsubmitted along with the request for the water quality certification. (3)\n\nIn support of any request for a water\nquality certification, an applicant shall demonstrate compliance with the\nprovisions referenced in 6 NYCRR section 608.9. A request for a water quality\ncertification will not be considered valid until the applicant files with the\nsecretary a copy of its related Federal permit application. (4)\n\nAny applicant that applies for a Federal\nlicense or permit that will require a water quality certification shall provide\nthe pertinent contact information for the district engineer of the U.S. Army\n\nCorps of Engineers or other Federal lead agency to use in contacting the board\nas to the applicable time period or any other issue. (5)\n\nWhen an applicant or certificate holder\nhas requested both a water quality certification from the board and permits\nfrom the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other Federal lead agency, the board\nor a designee will provide information to the district engineer or other\n\nFederal lead agency as to whether circumstances require a period of time longer\nthan the period specified in applicable Federal regulations for the certifying\nagency to act on the request for certification in order to avoid a waiver. The\nboard shall issue, waive or deny such certification within such applicable\nperiod after the filing of the application or other document in which the\nrequest is made, taking into account whether any Federal agency from which the\napplicant or certificate holder has sought a license or permit to conduct any\nactivity that may result in any discharge into the navigable waters has: (i) advised the board that such certification\nmust either be issued or denied within a specified shorter period or be waived; or\n(ii)\ndetermined that such\ncertification may either be issued or denied within a specified longer period, not to exceed one year (based on information provided by a designee of the\nboard), or be waived. (6)\n\nIf it appears that the review of a\nrequest for a water quality certification cannot be completed within the\napplicable period identified in paragraph (5) of this subdivision, the board or\na designee will deny the certification without prejudice to a later request for\ncertification. (7)\n\nThe DPS Director\nof the Office of Energy Efficiency and the Environment is designated to act as\nthe designee referenced in this section. (8)\n\nIf the request for a water quality\ncertification does not accompany an application, it shall be filed and served\nand notice of it shall be given in the same manner as an application pursuant\nto sections 1000.6 and\n1000.7\nof this Part. If the\nrequest for a water quality certification is filed after the issuance of the\narticle 10 certificate, and such request proposes changes of a nature that\nlitigated issues would need to be reopened, such request shall be treated as a\nrequest also for a revision of the article 10 certificate. (b) If the proposed facility affects any land\nor water use or natural resource of the coastal area and Federal authorization\nor funding is necessary, the applicant shall, contemporaneously with submitting\nthe application, submit to DOS copies of the application, the applicant's\ncoastal consistency certification and necessary data and information sufficient\nto initiate a review by DOS pursuant to the Federal Coastal Zone Management Act\nand its regulations. (1)\n\nThe hearing shall be\nused to elicit, and the hearing record in the proceedings shall provide, information on which the Secretary of State may base the determination of\nwhether or not to concur with the applicant's coastal consistency\ncertification. (2)\n\nThe Secretary of\n\nState may use procedures established in the article 10 proceeding to the extent\nthat they are consistent with the Federal Coastal Zone Management Act and its\nimplementing regulations to facilitate the required concurrence. The Secretary\nof State is encouraged to provide such determination to the board prior to its\ndecision whether or not to issue a certificate. (c) If the proposed facility affects any land\nor water use or natural resource of the coastal areas and inland waterways, the\nboard invites DOS, pursuant to article 42 of the Executive Law, to review, evaluate and issue recommendations and opinions to the board concerning the\npotential for the proposal to affect such coastal areas and inland waterways, and policies related thereto.
