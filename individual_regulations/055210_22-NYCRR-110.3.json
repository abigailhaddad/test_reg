Form B-1 prescribes the form and contents of this application and the order\nextending the examination period. If the commissioner informs the court that\nconfinement of the defendant is necessary for an effective examination, the\ncourt must direct that the defendant be confined in a facility designated by\nthe commissioner until the examination is completed [C PL 330.20(3)]. This\ndirection may be made orally, on the record, in open court. (d) When an examination order\nis issued, the clerk of the court shall promptly forward or furnish a copy of\nthis order to the persons named in Form A or Form B.
