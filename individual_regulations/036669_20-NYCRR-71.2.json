  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 71.2 - Agent's credit bond requirement\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 472(1)\n(a) Every cigarette agent, and every\napplicant for a license as a cigarette agent, who desires to establish credit\nfor the purpose of purchasing cigarette stamps on credit is required to: (1)\nfile and maintain with the department a\ncredit bond executed by a surety company which is: (i) authorized to transact business in this\n\nState; (ii)\nregistered with and\nunder the supervision of the Insurance Department of New York State; and\n(iii)\napproved by the\n\nSuperintendent of Insurance as to solvency and responsibility; or\n(2)\ndeposit and maintain with the\ndepartment such other acceptable security enumerated in section\n71.3\nof\nthis Part. Such bond or security must be in such amount as the department may\nrequire to secure the payment of any sum due from the agent pursuant to article\n20 of the Tax Law. (b) Credit bonds. (1)\n\nThe Department\nof Taxation and Finance may, in its discretion, permit a licensed cigarette\nagent to purchase stamps and to pay for such stamps within 30 days after the\ndate of purchase, provided the agent has filed a credit bond (or has deposited\nother acceptable security) with the department in the required amount\nconditioned upon such payment. An applicant for a license as a cigarette agent\nor a licensed agent who wishes to purchase stamps on credit must apply to the\ndepartment for permission to do so. The department will evaluate such request\nin the same manner as it evaluates applications for licenses as cigarette\nagents. Where the department ascertains that the authorization to purchase\ncigarette stamps on a 30-day credit basis will not jeopardize the payment of\nany sums due the State from the agent pursuant to article 20 of the Tax Law, it\nwill fix the amount of the credit bond to be filed. (2)\n\nIn determining the amount of a credit\nbond, the department will consider the amount of credit requested by the\napplicant or agent and, in all cases, the amount of such bond shall be at least\nequal to the amount of the New York State tax represented by the cigarette\nstamps to be purchased on credit without regard to any commissions due the\nagent with respect to such stamps. Additionally, the department may require the\ncredit bond to be in an amount which is sufficient to secure the payment of any\npenalties, interest or other sums which may become due from the agent pursuant\nto article 20. No credit for the purchase of cigarette stamps shall be granted\nin excess of the amount secured for such purpose by a credit bond. A licensed\ncigarette agent may apply to the department for an increase in the amount of\nsuch credit subject to the same conditions as the original request for\nauthority to purchase stamps on a 30-day credit basis. (3)\n\nThe credit bond described herein is\nrequired to secure the payment of any sums due the State pursuant to article 20\nof the Tax Law. Agents who desire to purchase joint State and New York City\ncigarette tax stamps on a 30-day credit basis must also file or deposit the\nappropriate bond or security with the City of New York to secure the payment of\nany sums due the city (see Chapter 13 of Title 11 of the New York City\n\nAdministrative Code).
