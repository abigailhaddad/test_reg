  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 84.3 - Transmission right-of-way maintenance programs and schedules\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each member\nsystem of the New York Power Pool, except the Power Authority of the State of\n\nNew York, shall, by March 31, 1981, prepare and file with the commission a\nright-of-way (ROW) maintenance program for its transmission system which is\ndesigned to achieve the company's long-range ROW management planning goals. At\na minimum, the program should contain the following elements: (1)\nprovisions for regular inspections of the\nROW's, including the specifics of the types of inspection and the frequencies\nof inspection; (2)\nspecific\nquantitative criteria relating to the clearances between conductors and\nvegetation and the corresponding range of time in which the vegetation\nmaintenance must be performed. These criteria are to be used by ROW inspectors\nin determining when maintenance is necessary; (3)\na requirement that annual schedules for\nthe treatment of vegetation based on the results of the ROW inspections be\nprepared; (4)\npreparation and use\nof standardized inspection reports to record the findings of all ROW and\nvegetation inspections; (5)\nthe\npreparation and use of standardized reports of all ROW maintenance and\nvegetation treatments. Reports must include the type, location, acreage, and\ndate of all mechanical, chemical or other treatments; and\n(6)\nretention, for three years, of herbicide\napplication reports, and retention, for a period to coincide with the\nmaintenance cycle of the company, of ROW inspection dates, maintenance\nschedules and maintenance activities for each ROW in the transmission system. Maintenance information may be summarized on an annual basis and recorded on\nthe permanent record for each transmission facility. (b) It is the commission's intention by\nimposing these requirements to allow the utilities to develop their own ROW\nmaintenance programs, but yet ensure that adequate records are maintained so\nthat staff of the department may periodically examine them and report to the\ncommission if they find that ROW vegetation treatment is being postponed or\ndeferred to the extent that it threatens either the performance of the line\nduring emergencies or attainment of the goals of the long-range ROW management\nplan.
