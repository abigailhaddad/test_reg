  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 6.4 - Qualification of school bus drivers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In addition to the qualification\nprocedures which must be followed for each bus driver and the forms which must\nbe submitted for each bus driver as set forth in section\n6.3\nof this Part, any motor\ncarrier which employs a driver who operates a school bus as defined in section\n6.2\n(b) of this\n\nPart must require such driver to be fingerprinted as required by section\n509-d\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law. (b) Previously fingerprinted drivers. School bus drivers previously fingerprinted by a former\ncarrier which employed them in accordance with this Part, may not need to be\nrefingerprinted by a new employer/carrier. Verification of prior fingerprinting\nmust be made by contacting the BDU. If it is verified, the completed article\n19-A driver application form (DS-870) is the only item which should be\nsubmitted for that driver. (c) \"Conditional\" school bus\ndriver. Pending criminal history clearance, the motor carrier\nshall classify each new school bus driver as conditionally hired for a period\nnot to exceed 90 days from the date of hiring. Such period may only be extended\nwith the written permission of the BDU. (d) The BDU is authorized by law to access\ncriminal conviction records maintained in the file of DCJS and the FBI\nidentification division, for the purposes of determining an individual's\nqualification for employment as a driver of a school bus operating in New York\n\nState. (1)\n\nIf the department receives\nnotification from DCJS or the FBI that the driver has a criminal conviction\nwhich will disqualify him or her as set forth in section\n6.28\nof this Part, it shall advise\nthe driver, motor carrier, and/or school district/contractor of such\ndisqualification. Upon receipt of such notice of disqualification, the motor\ncarrier shall not permit the person to operate a school bus. (2)\n\nIf the department receives notification\nfrom DCJS or the FBI that the school bus driver has a pending criminal offense\nwhich could disqualify the person upon conviction, it shall advise the driver, motor carrier and/or school district/contractor of such possible\ndisqualification, but shall not specify the offense. The motor carrier and/or\nschool district shall require the applicant to provide documentation to the BDU\nupon disposition of such offense, consisting of an original document, not a\ncopy, with the seal of the court and the signature of the presiding justice or\ncourt clerk. (e) Appeal process. Upon notification from DCJS or the FBI that a driver has\nbeen convicted of or is charged with a criminal offense which would or could\ndisqualify him or her as a school bus driver under section\n6.28\nof this Part, the DMV shall\nnotify the driver of his or her right to appeal. If the driver or applicant is\nchallenging the accuracy or completeness of court disposition information on\nfile with DCJS or the FBI, he or she shall be advised of the procedures to be\nutilized in appealing this information. An appeal of disqualification based upon a conviction may\nnot be appealed to the department's Appeals Board. In such cases, the driver\nmay pursue a legal remedy in the courts pursuant to the provisions of article\n78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. If the disqualification arises out of\nmatter which is not a conviction, the driver may appeal to the Appeals Board\nwithin 60 days of the determination of disqualification. The Appeals Board may\nbe contacted at the Empire State Plaza, Albany, NY 12228. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
