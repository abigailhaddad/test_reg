(b) Reporting Threshold. (1)\n\nPursuant to section 1-e of the Lobbying\n\nAct, every Lobbyist that incurs, expends, or receives or reasonably anticipates\nincurring, expending, or receiving more than $5,000 in combined Reportable\n\nCompensation and Expenses for Lobbying Activity on a State and/or local level, in any calendar year during the biennial period, must file a biennial Statement\nof Registration with the Commission. (2)\n\nFor purposes of determining whether the\nthresholds have been met, the amounts incurred, expended or received shall be\ncomputed cumulatively for all Lobbying Activities. (c) For purposes of this section, \"biennial\"\nshall mean every two-year period commencing with the January 1, 2005 - December\n31, 2006 period, and so on thereafter. (d) Once a Lobbyist meets or anticipates\nmeeting the cumulative $5,000 threshold, a Lobbyist must file a Statement of\n\nRegistration for every Client for whom the Lobbyist lobbies, regardless of\n\nCompensation or Expenses paid by each Client individually. (1)\nA Statement of Registration must be filed\nfor each Lobbyist/Client relationship emanating from the same lobbying\nagreement or authorization to lobby for the same purpose. (e) Due Dates.

(a) Such\n\nStatement of Registration should be filed within 15 days of the date on which\nthe Lobbyist has agreed to - or been authorized to - begin Lobbying\n\nActivity. (b) The Commission\nconsiders such date to be the start date provided in the Lobbying Agreement or\nauthorization, not the date of execution. (c) No later than 10 days after exceeding the\n$5,000 threshold, if the Lobbyist actually incurs or receives combined\n\nCompensation and Expenses in excess of $5,000 before filing a Statement of\n\nRegistration.

(i) Filing Fee. (1)\nA $200 filing fee (payable in U.S. dollars) must be submitted with each Statement of Registration for the biennial\nperiod that the Lobbyist reasonably anticipates exceeding $5,000 in combined\n\nReportable Compensation and Expenses for any year in the biennial period.
