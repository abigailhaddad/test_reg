  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 709.17 - Long-term ventilator beds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This\nmethodology will be utilized to evaluate certificate of need applications for\nthe certification of long-term ventilator beds, which are operated in\nresidential health care facilities for individuals experiencing respiratory\nfailure who can be treated through mechanical ventilation. It is the intent of\nthe State Hospital Review and Planning Council that this methodology, when used\nin conjunction with the planning standards and criteria set forth in section\n709.1\nof this Part, become a\nstatement of planning principles and decision making tools for directing the\ndistribution of long-term ventilator beds. The goals and objectives of the\nmethodology expressed herein are expected to ensure that an adequate number of\nlong-term ventilator beds are available to provide access to care and avoid the\nunnecessary duplication of resources. (b) The factors for determining the public\nneed for long-term ventilator beds shall include, but not be limited to, the\nfollowing: (1)\n\nThe planning areas for\ndetermining the public need for long-term ventilator beds shall be the\ndesignated health systems regions. (2)\n\nThe number of long-term ventilator beds\nin each health systems region required to meet the public need shall be\ndetermined by dividing the projected annual patient days for the service by\n365, and dividing the result by 0.95 to allow for a 95 percent occupancy rate. The projected long-term ventilator patient days used in this calculation shall\nbe determined as follows: (i) The annual\nnumber of potential candidates for long-term ventilator beds shall be\ndetermined by calculating the total number of annual general hospital\ndischarges in the planning area for DRG 475 (respiratory system diagnosis with\nventilator support), plus an additional 10 percent, and multiplying the\nresulting figure by 0.32. (ii)\n\nThe\nnumber of potential candidates for long-term ventilator beds shall be\nmultiplied by a 125-day length-of-stay to project the annual number of patient\ndays for long-term ventilator patients. (3)\n\nThe review of certificate of need\napplications will consider the documented referral patterns in the planning\narea, the expected length-of-stay based on the case-mix of long-term and\nshort-term patients, the ability of the applicant to successfully wean\nventilator patients, and the ability and commitment of the applicant to accept\nthe difficult-to-place ventilator patients (e.g., ventilator patients with\nhemodialysis needs or patients with bacterial infections). (4)\n\nThe long-term ventilator bed need\nmethodology will be reviewed within three years from the effective date of this\nsection. (c) (1)\n\nThe bed need estimates developed pursuant\nto subdivision (b) of this section shall constitute the public need for\nventilator beds in the planning area subject to further adjustments in\naccordance with subdivision (d) of this section. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding that there is an\nindication of need in a planning area for additional long-term ventilator beds\nas determined in accordance with subdivision (b) of this section, there shall\nbe a rebuttable presumption that there is no need for any additional long-term\nventilator beds in such planning area if the overall occupancy rate for\nexisting long-term ventilator beds in such planning area is less than 95\npercent based on the most recently available data. It shall be the\nresponsibility of an applicant in such instances to demonstrate that there is a\nneed for additional long-term ventilator beds despite the less than 95 percent\noccupancy rate in the planning area utilizing the factors set forth in\nsubdivision (d) of this section. (3)\n\nThe department shall evaluate the\nappropriateness of the 95 percent occupancy threshold criterion in this\nsection, based on the most recent data available, within three years of the\neffective date of this section. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of\nthis section, when the estimates of need for long-term ventilator beds\ndeveloped in accordance with subdivision (b) of this section indicate the need\nfor additional beds, such estimates of additional need may be modified, based\non information and data gathered from relevant sources relating to significant\nlocal factors pertaining to the planning area, or on statewide factors, where\nrelevant, which factors may include, but not necessarily be limited to, those\nset forth in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this subdivision. When making\nrecommendations to the State Hospital Review and Planning Council and the\n\nPublic Health Council concerning the impact of the factors set forth in this\nsubdivision, the department shall, to the extent practicable, indicate the\nrelative priority of such factors: (1)\nthe\nimpact of requirements pertaining to placing persons with disabilities into the\nmost integrated setting appropriate so as to enable persons with disabilities\nto interact with non-disabled persons to the fullest extent possible; (2)\nrecommendations made by the local health\nsystems agency, if applicable; (3)\ndocumented evidence of the unduplicated number of patients on waiting lists who\nare appropriate for admission to long-term ventilator care who experience a\nlong stay in acute care facilities awaiting discharge to a residential health\ncare facility for long-term ventilator care.
