  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 38.9 - Duration of licenses and timeliness in decommissioning\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as provided in section\n38.10\nof this Part, a license\nshall expire at the end of the expiration date therein stated. The filing of an\napplication by the licensee more than 30 days prior to the expiration date for\na renewal or a new and superseding license shall extend the license until the\ncommissioner has finally acted on the application. If a licensee fails to renew\nhis or her license, he or she must immediately cease all use of radioactive\nmaterials, transfer all radioactive materials to authorized recipient(s) and\ncomply with the requirements of section\n38.23\nof this Part (rule). To\nterminate a license, the licensee must notify the commissioner, transfer all\nradioactive materials to authorized recipients and comply with the provisions\nof section\n38.23\nof this Part\n(rule). (b) Each specific license\nrevoked by the commissioner expires at the end of the day on the date of the\ncommissioner's final determination to revoke the license, unless an alternate\nexpiration date is stated in the determination, or is otherwise provided for in\nthe commissioner's order. (c) Each\nspecific license continues in effect, beyond the expiration date if necessary, with respect to possession of radioactive material until the commissioner\nnotifies the licensee in writing that the license is terminated. During this\ntime, the licensee shall: (1)\nlimit actions\ninvolving radioactive material to those related to decommissioning; and\n(2)\ncontinue to control entry\nto restricted areas until they are suitable for release in accordance with\ndepartment requirements. (d) Within 60 days of the occurrence of any\nof the following, each licensee shall provide notification to the department in\nwriting of such occurrence, and either begin decommissioning its site, or any\nseparate building or outdoor area that contains residual radioactivity so that\nthe building or outdoor area is suitable for release in accordance with\ndepartment requirements, or submit within 12 months of notification a\ndecommissioning plan, if required by section\n38.23\n(c) of this\n\nPart, and begin decommissioning upon approval of that plan if: (1)\nthe license has expired pursuant to\nsubdivision (a) or (b) of this section; (2)\nthe licensee has decided to permanently\ncease principal activities, as defined in this Part, at the entire site or in\nany separate building or outdoor area that contains residual radioactivity such\nthat the building or outdoor area is unsuitable for release in accordance with\ndepartment requirements; (3)\nno\nprincipal activities under the license have been conducted for a period of 24\nmonths; or\n(4)\nno principal\nactivities have been conducted for a period of 24 months in any separate\nbuilding or outdoor area that contains residual radioactivity such that the\nbuilding or outdoor area is unsuitable for release in accordance with\ndepartment requirements. (e) Coincident with the notification required\nby subdivision (d) of this section, the licensee shall maintain in effect all\ndecommissioning financial assurances established by the licensee pursuant to\nsection\n38.7\nof this Part in conjunction\nwith a license issuance or renewal or as required by this section. The amount\nof the financial assurance must be increased, or may be decreased, as\nappropriate, to cover the detailed cost estimate for decommissioning\nestablished pursuant to section\n38.23\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (1)\n\nAny licensee who has not provided\nfinancial assurance to cover the detailed cost estimate submitted with the\ndecommissioning plan shall do so when this rule becomes effective. (2)\n\nFollowing approval of the decommissioning\nplan, a licensee may reduce the amount of the financial assurance as\ndecommissioning proceeds and radiological contamination is reduced at the site\nwith the approval of the department. (f) The department may grant a request to\nextend the time periods established in subdivision (d) of this section if the\ndepartment determines that this relief is not detrimental to the public health\nand safety and is otherwise in the public interest. The request must be\nsubmitted no later than 30 days before notification pursuant to subdivision (d)\nof this section. The schedule for decommissioning set forth in subdivision (d)\nof this section may not commence until the department has made a determination\non the request. (1)\n\nThe department may approve\nan alternate schedule for submittal of a decommissioning plan required pursuant\nto subdivision (d) of this section if the department determines that the\nalternative schedule is necessary to the effective conduct of decommissioning\noperations and presents no undue risk from radiation to the public health and\nsafety and is otherwise in the public interest. (2)\n\nFor decommissioning plans calling for\ncompletion of decommissioning later than 24 months after plan approval, the\nplan shall include a justification for the delay based on the criteria in\nsubdivision (h) of this section. (g) (1)\n\nExcept as provided in subdivision (h) of this section, licensees shall complete\ndecommissioning of the site or separate building or outdoor area as soon as\npracticable but no later than 24 months following the initiation of\ndecommissioning. (2)\n\nExcept as\nprovided in subdivision (h) of this section, when decommissioning involves the\nentire site, the licensee shall request license termination as soon as\npracticable but not later than 24 months following the initiation of\ndecommissioning. (h) The\ndepartment may approve a request for an alternative schedule for completion of\ndecommissioning of the site or separate building or outdoor area, and license\ntermination if appropriate, if the department determines that the alternative\nis warranted by consideration of the following: (1)\nwhether it is technically feasible to\ncomplete decommissioning within the allotted 24-month period; (2)\nwhether sufficient waste disposal\ncapacity is available to allow completion of decommissioning within the\nallotted 24-month period; (3)\nwhether a significant volume reduction in wastes requiring disposal will be\nachieved by allowing short-lived radionuclides to decay; (4)\nwhether a significant reduction in\nradiation exposure to workers can be achieved by allowing short-lived\nradionuclides to decay; and\n(5)\nother site-specific factors which the department may consider appropriate on a\ncase-by-case basis. (i) As the final step in decommissioning, the licensee shall: (1)\ncertify the disposition of all licensed\nmaterial, including accumulated wastes; (2)\nconduct a radiation survey of the\npremises where the licensed activities were carried out; (3)\nsubmit a report of the results of this\nsurvey unless the licensee demonstrates that the premises are suitable for\nrelease in some other manner; and\n(4)\nas appropriate: (i) report levels of gamma radiation in units\nof millisieverts (microrem) per hour at one meter from surfaces, and report\nlevels of radioactivity, including alpha and beta, in units of megabecquerels\n(disintegrations per minute or microcuries) per 100 square\ncentimeters--removable and fixed -- for surfaces, megabecquerels (microcuries)\nper milliliter for water, and becquerels (picocuries) per gram for solids such\nas soils or concrete; and\n(ii)\nspecify the survey instrument(s) used and certify that each instrument is\nproperly calibrated and tested. (j) Specific licenses, including expired\nlicenses, will be terminated by written notice to the licensee when the\ndepartment determines that: (1)\nradioactive\nmaterial has been properly disposed; (2)\na reasonable effort has been made to\neliminate residual radioactive contamination, if present; and\n(3)\n(i) a\nradiation survey has been performed which demonstrates that the premises are\nsuitable for release in accordance with department requirements; or\n(ii)\nother information submitted by the\nlicensee is sufficient to demonstrate that the premises are suitable for\nrelease in accordance with department requirements.
