  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 459.9 - Winter discontinuance procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) During the period November 1 to April 15, the following discontinuance procedures for nonpayment of service bills\nrendered, for failure to post a required deposit, or for tampering or for theft\nof services, are to be observed where electric service is necessary to heat, or\nto operate a heating system in a residence: (1)\n\nIn addition to the procedures set forth\nin sections\n459.3\nthrough\n459.7\nof this Part, the utility\nshall be required to make diligent efforts by telephone or in person to\nestablish contact with the delinquent customer or a responsible resident adult\n(18 years or older) at the service address at least 72 hours prior to\ntermination. At a minimum, attempts at personal contact shall include one\nattempt during normal working hours and in the event that personal contact is\nnot achieved, at least one attempt during reasonable nonbusiness periods herein\ndefined as: Monday through Friday\n6 p.m. to 9 p.m. Saturdays, Sundays and Holidays\n9 a.m. to 5 p.m. If communication with the person contacted is not possible\nbecause of an apparent language barrier, the utility shall take reasonable\nsteps to assure proper communication before discontinuance. During the contact, the utility's representative shall fully explain the reasons for discontinuance\nand shall attempt to ascertain whether a serious impairment to human health may\nresult. If contact is made and in the judgment of the representative of the\nutility no impairment to human health would occur, service may be discontinued. If, however, in the judgment of the representative of the utility, discontinuance of electric service will lead to serious impairment of human\nhealth to any resident of the premises, the service shall not be\ndiscontinued. (2)\n\nFor the\npurpose of this Part, a serious impairment to human health is indicated if a\ncustomer or other resident appears to be seriously impaired and may, because of\nmental or physical problems, be unable to manage his own resources, carry out\nactivities of daily living or protect himself from neglect or hazardous\nsituations without assistance from others. Indicators of serious impairment to\nhuman health include, but are not limited to: (i) age, infirmity or mental\nincapacitation; (ii)\nuse of life\nsupport systems, such as dialysis machines or iron lungs; (iii)\nserious illness; (iv)\nphysical disability, including blindness\nand limited mobility; (v) recent\ndeath in the family; (vi)\nthe\npresence of young children; and\n(vii)\nany other factual circumstances which\nindicate severe or hazardous health situations. The above criteria are general standards and the utility's\nrepresentatives must exercise discretion, sound judgment and common sense in\nascertaining whether a serious impairment to human health exists. Doubts should\nbe resolved in favor of continued service. (3)\n\nInformation concerning the circumstances\nwhere it is found that discontinuance of service would lead to serious\nimpairment to human health is to be documented and the account referred to the\nlocal social services commissioner. No utility shall terminate service for\nnonpayment where a customer or other resident exhibits an indication of a\nserious impairment to human health, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this\nsection, unless: (i) the utility notifies the\nlocal social services commissioner orally, and within five days in writing, that the customer or other resident exhibits an indication of a serious\nimpairment to human health; and\n(ii)\nthe local social services commissioner, after an investigation, informs the utility that the health-impairing condition\ndoes not exist or is not serious, or that an alternative means for protecting\nthe person's health has been devised. The utility may exercise its own discretion with respect to\nterminating service to the customer in the event it does not receive an oral or\nwritten report from the local social services commissioner within 15 business\ndays after the written referral of the matter by the utility to the\ncommissioner. (4)\nif contact is not made after several good faith attempts, on the day\ntermination of service is scheduled, a representative of the utility must visit\nthe premises in order to determine whether there is continuing occupancy and\nwhether a serious impairment to human health, as described in paragraph (a)(2)\nof this section, exists. If such an impairment is found to exist, or again no\ncontact is made and there is reason to believe the premises has not been\nvacated, service shall not be discontinued and the account shall be immediately\nreferred to the local social services commissioner. In all cases referred to\nthe local social services commissioner, the utility shall request that the\ncommissioner report back to the utility his findings and any required action. If the utility or the social services commissioner determines that no customer\nor other person residing in the premises faces impairment to his or her health, or that an alternative means for protecting the person's health has been\ndevised, the utility may immediately discontinue the electric\nservice. (b) During the\nperiod September 1 to November 1 of each year, the utility shall review all\ncases where discontinuance of service occurred during the prior 12-month period\nwhere the electric service provided was necessary to heat a residence, or to\noperate a heating system therein, and where service has not been restored. A\nrepresentative of the utility must, by telephone or in person, contact the\ndelinquent customer or a responsible resident 18 years of age or older to\ndetermine if continued lack of service may expose the customer or other\nresident of the premises to a serious impairment to human health. If such\ndetermination is made, the customer shall be referred to the local social\nservices commissioner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
