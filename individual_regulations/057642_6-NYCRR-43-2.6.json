  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 43-2.6 - Harvest restrictions; surf clams\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ndepartment shall establish an annual harvest limit for surfclams that will\ncontrol the maximum allowable harvest of surfclams that may be taken by\nmechanical means from the certified waters of the Atlantic Ocean for the period\n\nJanuary 1st through December 31st. The annual harvest limit shall not exceed\nfive percent of the fully recruited biomass based on the most recent surfclam\npopulation assessment (survey) for the Atlantic Ocean. In establishing the\nannual harvest limit, the department shall afford an opportunity for public\ncomment and consider stock assessments, catch reports and other relevant\nbiological and statistical information. The annual harvest limit shall be\nannounced no later than November 15th of the year preceding its effective date\nof January 1st. This limit shall be established by written directive of the\ncommissioner or commissioner's designee and written notice of any such\ndirectives shall be provided to all permit holders. (b) An individual fishing quota system (IFQ)\nhas been established which will allocate to each eligible vessel an annual\nindividual fishing quota. The individual fishing quota shall be determined\nannually based on the annual harvest limit referenced in subdivision (a) of\nthis section divided equally by the number of eligible vessels authorized to\nparticipate in the Atlantic Ocean surfclam fishery. The IFQ assigned to an\neligible vessel shall be nontransferable and each vessel can only be used to\ncatch one quota allocation. No eligible vessel shall take or attempt to take\nmore than one quota allocation of surfclams on any surfclam/ocean quahog\n\nAtlantic Ocean permit or take more than the cumulative equivalent of one quota\nallocation if identified as the eligible vessel on one or more surfclam/ocean\nquahog Atlantic Ocean permits when authorized pursuant to section\n43-3.5\nof Subpart 43-3, during any\ncalendar year. The IFQ will expire on December 31st of each year and any unused\nquota not taken prior to the end of the year will not roll over into the next\nyear but will remain uncaught. (c) No vessel assigned an IFQ may be used to harvest more than 28 standard cages of\nsurfclams (equivalent to 896 industry standard bushels) in any one\nday. (d) It is unlawful for any\nvessel assigned an IFQ to be used to catch another vessel's individual fishing\nquota. (e) It is unlawful for any\nvessel to take, possess, land, offload, remove or otherwise transfer, or\nattempt to take, land, offload, remove or otherwise transfer surfclams that\nhave been harvested from New York State waters under an IFQ on the same day\nthat such vessel has been used to take surfclams from the Exclusive Economic\n\nZone or from the waters of any state having a surfclam fishery. (f) It is unlawful for any vessel to take, possess, land or attempt to take, land or offload any surfclams harvested\npursuant to this Subpart in excess of, or without, an individual fishing\nallocation. (g) In order to\npreserve and protect surfclams of less than legal size, the department may\nestablish one or more areas, containing a total of no more than 15 percent of\nthe estimated standing stock of surfclams, where harvesting is prohibited. In\nestablishing such areas, the department shall consider the effect of any such\nareas on stocks in harvestable areas. In addition, the department shall consult\nwith the Surf Clam/Ocean Quahog Management Advisory Board, afford an\nopportunity for public comment, and consider stock assessments, catch reports, and other relevant biological and statistical information. Such areas shall, by\nestimation, contain more than 50 percent sublegal size surfclams by number and, once established, any such area shall be re-evaluated within 18 months of\nestablishment. In the event that any such area is not re- evaluated, such area\nshall become available for harvest. The establishment of any such area shall be\nby written directive of the commissioner or the commissioner's designee, and a\nminimum of 48 hours written notice of any such directive shall be provided to\nall permit owners. (h) It shall be\nunlawful for any person to exceed the harvest restrictions set forth in this\nsection or in any directive issued pursuant hereto. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
