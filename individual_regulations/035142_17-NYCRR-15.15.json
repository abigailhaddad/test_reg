  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 15.15 - Content of DEIS's and FEIS's\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All draft and final EIS's shall be preceded by a cover sheet stating: (1)\nwhether it is a draft or final\nEIS; (2)\nthe name or descriptive\ntitle of the action; (3)\nthe\nlocation (county and town, village or city) of the action; (4)\nthe name and address of the department\nand the name and telephone number of a department employee who can provide\nfurther information; (5)\nthe name\nof any individual or organization, other than the department or department\nemployees, that prepared any portion of the statement; (6)\nthe date of acceptance by the\ndepartment; (7)\nin the case of a\nDEIS, the date by which comments must be submitted. (b) A DEIS or FEIS shall have a table of\ncontents following the cover sheet and a precise summary which adequately and\naccurately summarizes the statement. (c) The body of all DEIS's and FEIS's shall\nat least contain the following: (1)\na concise\ndescription of the proposed action, its purpose, public need and benefits, including social and economic considerations; (2)\na concise description of the\nenvironmental setting of the areas to be affected, sufficient to understand the\neffects of the proposed action and alternatives; (3)\na statement and evaluation of the\nenvironmental impacts of the proposed action, including reasonably related\nshort- and long-term effects, cumulative effects and other associated\nenvironmental effects; (4)\nan\nidentification and brief discussion of any adverse environmental impacts which\ncannot be avoided or adequately mitigated if the proposed action is\nimplemented; (5)\na description and\nevaluation of the range of reasonable alternatives to the action which are\nfeasible, considering the objectives and capabilities of the project sponsor. The description and evaluation of each alternative should be at a level of\ndetail sufficient to permit a comparative assessment of the alternatives\ndiscussed. The range of alternatives must include the no-action alternative and\nmay include, as appropriate, alternative: (i) sites; (ii)\ntechnology; (iii)\nscale or magnitude; (iv)\ndesign; (v) timing; (vi)\nuse; and\n(vii)\ntypes of actions. For private applicants, any alternative for which no\ndiscretionary approvals are needed may be described. Site alternatives may be\nlimited to parcels owned by, or under option to, a private applicant; (6)\nan identification\nof any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be\nassociated with the proposed action should it be implemented; (7)\na description of mitigation measures to\nminimize the adverse environmental impacts; (8)\na description of any growth-inducing\naspects of the proposed action, if applicable and significant; (9)\na discussion of the effects of the\nproposed action on the use and conservation of energy, if applicable and\nsignificant; (10)\nfor State agency\nactions in the coastal area: (i) when the\naction is not in an approved local waterfront revitalization program area, an\nidentification of the applicable coastal policies of Executive Law, article 42, as contained in 19 NYCRR\n600.5, and a discussion of the effects of the proposed\naction on, and their consistency with, such policies; (ii)\nwhen the action is in an approved local\nwaterfront revitalization program area and the action is one identified by the\n\nSecretary of State pursuant to section\n916\n(1)(a)\nof the Executive Law, an\nidentification of the applicable policies of the local program and a discussion\nof the effects of the proposed action on such policies; (11)\na list of any underlying studies, reports and other information obtained and considered in preparing the\nstatement; and\n(12)\nif information\nabout reasonably foreseeable catastrophic impacts to the environment is\nunavailable because the cost to obtain it is exorbitant, or the means to obtain\nit are unknown, or there is uncertainty about its validity, and such\ninformation is essential to any agency's SEQR findings, the EIS must: (i) identify the nature and relevance of\nunavailable or uncertain information; (ii)\nprovide a summary of existing credible\nscientific evidence, if available; and\n(iii)\nassess the likelihood of occurrence, even if the probability of occurrence is low, and the consequences of the\npotential impact, using theoretical approaches or research methods generally\naccepted in the scientific community. This analysis would likely occur in the review of such\nactions as an oil supertanker port, a liquid propane gas/liquid natural gas\nfacility, or the siting of a hazardous waste treatment facility. It should not\napply in the review of such actions as shopping malls, residential subdivisions\nor office facilities. (d) A DEIS or FEIS may incorporate by\nreference all or portions of other documents which contain information relevant\nto the statement. The referenced documents shall be made available for\ninspection by the public, within the time period for public comment, in the\nsame places where the department makes available copies of the referencing\ndocument. When a DEIS or FEIS incorporates by reference, it shall contain a\nbrief description of the referenced document, its applicable findings in\nsummarized form and the date of its preparation. (e) An FEIS must consist of: the DEIS, including any revisions or supplements to it; copies or a summary of the\nsubstantive comments received; an indication of the source of each comment\nreceived; and the department's response to each substantive comment. The DEIS\nmay be directly incorporated into the FEIS or may be incorporated by reference. The department is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the FEIS, whether prepared by the department or by an applicant. All revisions and\nsupplements to the DEIS shall be specifically identified as such in the\nFEIS. (f) A generic impact\nstatement may be used to assess the environmental effects of separate actions\nhaving generic or common impacts. These statements and the record of decision\nbased thereon should set forth specific conditions or criteria under which\nindividual actions will be undertaken or approved. When an individual action is\nproposed by the department, which is encompassed within such a generic impact\nstatement and which will be carried out in conformance with the conditions and\ncriteria determined in the generic FEIS and its record of decision, there is no\nfurther obligation under this Part.
