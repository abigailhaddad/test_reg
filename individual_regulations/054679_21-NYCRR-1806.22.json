  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1806.22 - Standards for consumptive uses of water\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The project sponsors of all consumptive\nwater uses subject to review and approval under section\n1806.4, 1806.5 or\n1806.6\nof this Part shall comply\nwith this section. (b) Mitigation. All project sponsors whose consumptive use of water is subject to review and\napproval under section\n1806.4, 1806.5 or\n1806.6\nof this Part shall mitigate\nsuch consumptive use. Except to the extent that the project involves the\ndiversion of the waters out of the basin, public water supplies shall be exempt\nfrom the requirements of this section regarding consumptive use; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be construed to exempt individual\nconsumptive users connected to any such public water supply from the\nrequirements of this section. Mitigation may be provided by one, or a\ncombination of the following: (1)\nduring low\nflow periods as may be designated by the commission for consumptive use\nmitigation; (i) reduce withdrawal from the\napproved source(s), in an amount equal to the project's total consumptive use, and withdraw water from alternative surface water storage or aquifers or other\nunderground storage chambers or facilities approved by the commission, from\nwhich water can be withdrawn for a period of 90 days without impact to surface\nwater flows; (ii)\nrelease water for\nflow augmentation, in an amount equal to the project's total consumptive use, from surface water storage or aquifers, or other underground storage chambers\nor facilities approved by the commission, from which water can be withdrawn for\na period of 90 days without impact to surface water flows; (iii)\ndiscontinue the project's consumptive\nuse, except that reduction of project sponsor's consumptive use to less than\n20,000 gpd during periods of low flow shall not constitute\ndiscontinuance; (2)\nuse, as a source of consumptive use water, surface storage that is subject to\nmaintenance of a conservation release acceptable to the commission. In any case\nof failure to provide the specified conservation release, such project shall\nprovide mitigation in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subdivision, for\nthe calendar year in which such failure occurs, and the commission will\nreevaluate the continued acceptability of the conservation release; (3)\nprovide monetary payment to the\ncommission, for annual consumptive use, in an amount and manner prescribed by\nthe commission; (4)\nimplement other\nalternatives approved by the commission. (c) Determination of manner of mitigation. The commission will, in its sole discretion, determine the acceptable manner of\nmitigation to be provided by project sponsors whose consumptive use of water is\nsubject to review and approval. Such a determination will be made after\nconsidering the project's location, source characteristics, anticipated amount\nof consumptive use, proposed method of mitigation and their effects on the\npurposes set forth in section\n1806.2\nof this Part, and any other\npertinent factors. The commission may modify, as appropriate, the manner of\nmitigation, including the magnitude and timing of any mitigating releases, required in a project approval. (d) Quality of water released for mitigation. The physical, chemical and biological\nquality of water released for mitigation shall at all times meet the quality\nrequired for the purposes listed in section\n1806.2\nof this Part, as\napplicable. (e) Approval by rule for\nconsumptive uses. (1)\n\nExcept with respect to\nprojects involving hydrocarbon development subject to the provisions of\nsubdivision (f) of this section, any project whose sole source of water for\nconsumptive use is a public water supply, may be approved by the executive\ndirector under this subdivision in accordance with the following, unless the\nexecutive director determines that the project cannot be adequately regulated\nunder this approval by rule. (i) Notification\nof intent. No fewer than 90 days prior to the construction or implementation of\na project or increase above a previously approved quantity of consumptive use, the project sponsor shall: submit a notice of intent (NOI) on forms prescribed\nby the commission, and the applicable application fee, along with any required\nattachments. (ii)\n\nWithin 10 days\nafter submittal of an NOI under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the project\nsponsor shall satisfy the notice requirements set forth in section\n1806.15\nof this Part. (2)\n\nMetering, daily use monitoring\nand quarterly reporting. The project sponsor shall comply with metering, daily\nuse monitoring and quarterly reporting as specified in section\n1806.30\nof this Part. (3)\n\nStandard conditions. The standard\nconditions set forth in section\n1806.21\nof this Part above shall\napply to projects approved by rule. (4)\n\nMitigation. The project sponsor shall\ncomply with mitigation in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this\nsection. (5)\n\nCompliance with other\nlaws. The project sponsor shall obtain all necessary permits or approvals\nrequired for the project from other Federal, State or local government agencies\nhaving jurisdiction over the project. The commission reserves the right to\nmodify, suspend or revoke any approval under this subdivision if the project\nsponsor fails to obtain or maintain such approvals. (6)\n\nThe executive director may grant, deny, suspend, rescind, modify or condition an approval to operate under this\napproval by rule, or renew an existing approval by rule previously granted\nhereunder, and will notify the project sponsor of such determination, including\nthe quantity of consumptive use approved. (7)\n\nApproval by rule shall be effective upon\nwritten notification from the executive director to the project sponsor, shall\nexpire 15 years from the date of such notification, and shall be deemed to\nrescind any previous consumptive use approvals. (f) Approval by rule for consumptive use\nrelated to unconventional natural gas and other hydrocarbon development. (1)\n\nAny unconventional natural gas\ndevelopment project, or any hydrocarbon development project subject to review\nand approval under section\n1806.4, 1806.5, or\n1806.6\nof this Part, shall be\nsubject to review and approval by the executive director under this subdivision\nregardless of the source or sources of water being used\nconsumptively. (2)\n\nNotification of\nintent. Prior to undertaking a project or increasing a previously approved\nquantity of consumptive use, the project sponsor shall submit a notice of\nintent (NOI) on forms prescribed by the commission, and the appropriate\napplication fee, along with any required attachments. (3)\n\nWithin 10 days after submittal of an NOI\nunder paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the project sponsor shall satisfy the\nnotice requirements set forth in section\n1806.15\nof this Part.

The foregoing shall apply to all water, including\nstimulation additives, flowback, drilling fluids, formation fluids and\nproduction fluids, utilized by the project. The project sponsor shall also\nsubmit a post-hydrofracture report in a form and manner as prescribed by the\ncommission. (5)\n\nThe project sponsor\nshall comply with the mitigation requirements set forth in subdivision (b) of\nthis section. (6)\n\nAny flowback or\nproduction fluids utilized by the project sponsor for hydrofracture stimulation\nundertaken at the project shall be separately accounted for, but shall not be\nincluded in the daily consumptive use amount calculated for the project, or be\nsubject to the mitigation requirements of subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (7)\n\nThe project sponsor\nshall obtain all necessary permits or approvals required for the project from\nother Federal, state, or local government agencies having jurisdiction over the\nproject. The executive director reserves the right to modify, suspend or revoke\nany approval under this subdivision of this section if the project sponsor\nfails to obtain or maintain such approvals. (8)\n\nThe project sponsor shall certify to the\ncommission that all flowback and production fluids have been re-used or treated\nand disposed of in accordance with applicable state and Federal law.
