  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 4.10 - Exceptions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a\nrecommended decision is issued for exceptions, each party may file a brief on\nexceptions and a brief opposing exceptions, but the secretary may determine\nthat briefs opposing exceptions will not be entertained. Unless otherwise\nspecifically authorized by the secretary for the purpose of promoting the fair, orderly, and efficient conduct of the case, pleadings additional to those\nauthorized by this section will not be entertained. (b) Briefs on exceptions may be filed within\n20 days of the issuance of the recommended decision, and briefs opposing\nexceptions may be filed within 15 days thereafter. The secretary may extend or\ncurtail these time limits at the request of a party or on the secretary's own\nmotion. (c) (1)\n\nIn addition to meeting the requirements\nof this subdivision, briefs on exceptions and briefs opposing exceptions shall\ncomply with the requirements of section\n3.5\nof this Title and section\n4.8\nof this Part. They shall be\nself-contained, and may not incorporate earlier pleadings by\nreference. (2)\nA brief on\nexceptions shall contain: (i) a short\nstatement of the case; (ii)\na\nsummary of the party's basic position; (iii)\nthe grounds on which the exceptions\nrest; and\n(iv)\nthe argument in\nsupport of the exceptions, including references to the record and to\nauthorities relied on. The argumentation should not simply reiterate the\nparty's position, but should explain why the party believes the recommended\ndecision to be in error. (3)\nA brief opposing exceptions shall be\ndirected only at exceptions raised by other parties, and may not raise issues\nnot raised on exceptions. It shall identify each exception replied\nto. (4)\n\nIf only a brief on\nexceptions is authorized, it may not exceed 50 pages. If briefs on exceptions\nand opposing exceptions are authorized, they may not exceed 100 pages in total. The secretary may modify these page limitations at the request of a party or on\nthe secretary's own motion. (d) (1)\n\nAll\nrecommended decisions shall be subject to review by the commission, in whole or\nin part, regardless of whether exceptions have been filed. (2)\nA party's failure to except with respect\nto any issue shall constitute a waiver of any objection to the recommended\ndecision's resolution of that issue. If the commission adopts the recommended\nresolution, a party that has not excepted may not seek a different resolution\nof that issue on rehearing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
