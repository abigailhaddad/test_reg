  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 588.14 - Supplemental reimbursement for community support program services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In addition to\nthe medical assistance reimbursement rates available pursuant to Part 579 of\nthis Title and section\n588.13\nof this Part, providers\noperating one or more outpatient programs licensed pursuant to Part 585 or 587\nof this Title may be eligible to receive supplemental medical assistance\nreimbursement for community support program services in accordance with this\nsection. For purposes of this section: (1)\ncommunity support program services means community-based services supported by\n\nState and local aid for local or unified services pursuant to article 41 of the\n\nMental Hygiene Law, or community-based services supported by 100 percent State\naid; (2)\nlocal aid means local\nshare of funds which support services for persons with mental illness, comprised of local tax levy funds or contributions from voluntary agencies; and\n(3)\n\nState aid means State funds\nwhich support local or unified services for persons with mental illness, with\nor without matching local aid. (b) A provider shall be eligible for\nsupplemental reimbursement pursuant to this section if the provider: (1)\noperates a clinic treatment program, continuing day treatment program or day treatment program licensed pursuant to\n\nPart 585 or 587 of this Title; (2)\ndirectly provides community support program services pursuant to a contract\nwith the local governmental unit or the Office of Mental Health; (3)\nis not operated by the Office of Mental\n\nHealth; and\n(4)\nis not operated by\na general hospital as defined in article 28 of the Public Health Law, that is\nalso considered to be a voluntary agency as defined in article 41 of the Mental\n\nHygiene Law. (c) For\npurposes of this section, all providers operated by the New York City Health\nand Hospitals Corporation which are eligible for supplemental reimbursement\npursuant to subdivision (b) of this section shall be considered, in\ncombination, a single eligible provider. (d) Supplemental reimbursement rates shall be\ncalculated by the Office of Mental Health for each eligible provider. The\nsupplemental reimbursement rate, effective November 1, 1997, shall be\ncalculated as follows: (1)\n\nGrants from State\naid or local aid for community support program services for the local fiscal\nyear ended in 1997 for upstate and Long Island-based providers, and for the\nlocal fiscal year ended in 1998 for New York City-based providers, will be\nestimated for each eligible provider. For purposes of this section, unless\notherwise specified, such period shall be considered the base year. Such\nestimates shall not include: (i) grants\nreceived pursuant to section\n41.55\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law; (ii)\ngrants\nto housing programs; (iii)\nany\nportion of grants to community support programs for services which are\nreimbursed by medical assistance during the base year; (iv)\nany portion of grants to an eligible\nprovider for community support program services which are delivered by another\nprovider of service through a contract with the eligible provider; (v) grants received from the Federal\ngovernment; (vi)\nany portion of\ngrants to community support programs for services which are supported by\ncontributions from voluntary agencies; or\n(vii)\nany portion of grants determined by the\n\nOffice of Mental Health to be eligible for continued State aid. (2)\n\nGrants estimated pursuant to\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision shall be adjusted to reflect: (i) the percentage of community support\nprogram services which are determined by the Office of Mental Health to be\neligible for medical assistance reimbursement, consistent with Federal\nstandards; and\n(ii)\nthe percentage\nof community support program services provided to recipients who are eligible\nfor medical assistance. (3)\n\nThe combined total of clinic treatment, continuing day treatment, and day treatment units of service reimbursed by\nmedical assistance shall be calculated for each provider for each of the three\nlocal fiscal years immediately prior to the base year. Such units of service\nshall exclude collateral, group collateral, and home visits provided by an\noutpatient program operated by a general hospital as defined in article 28 of\nthe Public Health Law. The average of the three annual totals shall be\ncalculated. (4)\n\nGrants, as\nrecalculated pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision, shall be divided by\nthe average annual units of service calculated pursuant to paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision. The community support program rate cap will be established by\nthe Commissioner of Mental Health and approved by the Director of the Division\nof the Budget. (5)\n\nThe calculation\npursuant to paragraph (4) of this subdivision shall be divided by 89 percent. Such calculation shall be the provider's supplemental reimbursement\nrate. (6)\n\nOn an annual basis, the\n\nOffice of Mental Health shall re-evaluate the percentage used in the\ncalculation pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subdivision. Upon modification of\nsuch percentage, all providers' supplemental rates shall be\nrecalculated. (7)\n\nOn an annual\nbasis, the Office of Mental Health shall conduct a review of the number of\nunits of service calculated pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subdivision for\neach provider. For purposes of such analyses, the most recently completed local\nfiscal year shall be used as the base year. As appropriate, supplemental\nreimbursement rates shall be recalculated, including any recalculations\npursuant to paragraph (6) of this subdivision. (8)\n\nRates calculated or recalculated pursuant\nto this section are subject to appeal by the local governmental unit, or by the\nprovider with the approval of the local governmental unit. If a provider offers\ncommunity support program services solely pursuant to a contract with the\n\nOffice of Mental Health, such provider may request an appeal without the\napproval of the local governmental unit. Appeals pursuant to this paragraph\nshall be made within one year after receipt of initial notification of the most\nrecent supplemental reimbursement rate calculation or recalculation. (e) The supplemental reimbursement\nrate calculated pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section shall be added to\nthe reimbursement rates for each clinic treatment, continuing day treatment, and day treatment program operated by the provider and licensed pursuant to\n\nPart 585 or 587 of this Title. In outpatient programs operated by a general\nhospital as defined in article 28 of the Public Health Law, the following visit\ncategories shall not be eligible for the supplemental reimbursement rate: (1)\ncollateral and group collateral visits in\nclinic treatment and continuing day treatment programs; and\n(2)\ncollateral and home visits in day\ntreatment programs. (f) Supplemental payments which are in excess of 100 percent of the grants\ncalculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section will be subject to\nrecovery by the Office of Mental Health through adjustment of future payments. In cases where recoveries are necessary, the Office of Mental Health may adjust\nthe supplemental rate prospectively. (g) If supplemental payments are less than\nthe grants calculated pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Office\nof Mental Health shall, upon the request of the local governmental unit, amend\nthe supplemental reimbursement rate to ensure maintenance of historical levels\nof funding for community support program services. If a provider offers\ncommunity support program services solely pursuant to a contract with the\n\nOffice of Mental Health, such provider may request a rate amendment without the\napproval of the local governmental unit. In the event that amendment of the\nsupplemental reimbursement rate, consistent with the provisions of paragraph\n(d)(4) of this section, will not ensure the maintenance of historical levels of\nfunding for community support program services, the State aid portion of the\ngrants pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, commensurate with the\nshortfall, shall be allocated to the local governmental unit as State aid. If a\nprovider offers community support program services solely pursuant to a\ncontract with the Office of Mental Health, such State aid shall be allocated to\nthe provider. State aid allocated pursuant to this subdivision shall be subject\nto the availability of appropriations in the Office of Mental Health's budget\nand the approval of the director of the State Division of the Budget. (h) Providers in receipt of supplemental\nreimbursement pursuant to this section shall, at a minimum, maintain the level\nof provision of community support program services or the expenditures for such\nservices, consistent with the level of such services provided in the most\nrecent local fiscal year in which such services were supported by State or\nlocal aid, including any portion of grants which were supported by\ncontributions from voluntary agencies. If a provider reduces the provision of\ncommunity support program services or the expenditures for such services\nsubsequent to the calculation of the supplemental reimbursement rate pursuant\nto subdivision (d) of this section, and such reduced services are not\ntransferred to another provider, the supplemental reimbursement rate, upon the\nrecommendation of the local governmental unit, shall be adjusted in proportion\nto the reduction in community support program services. If a provider offers\ncommunity support program services solely pursuant to a contract with the\n\nOffice of Mental Health, the recommendation of the local governmental unit is\nnot required. Commensurate with the service reduction, the State aid portion of\ngrants pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be allocated to the\nlocal governmental unit as State aid, upon the request of the local\ngovernmental unit. If a provider offers community support program services\nsolely pursuant to a contract with the Office of Mental Health, such State aid\nshall be allocated to the provider. State aid allocated pursuant to this\nparagraph shall be subject to the availability of appropriations in the Office\nof Mental Health's budget and the approval of the director of the State\n\nDivision of the Budget. (i) If a\nprovider in receipt of supplemental reimbursement pursuant to this section\ntransfers or closes one or more community support programs, or portions\nthereof, which were supported by grants included in the calculation of the\nsupplemental reimbursement rate pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, such provider's supplemental reimbursement rate or grants shall be adjusted as\nfollows: (1)\n\nIf a community support program, or a portion thereof, is transferred to another eligible provider within the\nsame local governmental unit, the supplemental rate will be eliminated or\nrecalculated for each eligible provider, upon the approval of the local\ngovernmental unit, commensurate with the new level of community support program\nservices provided. If a provider offers community support program services\nsolely pursuant to a contract with the Office of Mental Health, the\nrecommendation of the local governmental unit is not required. In the event\nthat amendment of the supplemental reimbursement rate, consistent with the\nprovisions of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, will not ensure the maintenance\nof historical levels of funding for community support program services, the\n\nState aid portion of the grants pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this section, commensurate with the shortfall, shall be allocated to the local governmental\nunit as State aid. If a provider offers community support program services\nsolely pursuant to a contract with the Office of Mental Health, such State aid\nshall be allocated to the provider. State aid allocated pursuant to this\nparagraph shall be subject to the availability of appropriations in the Office\nof Mental Health's budget and the approval of the director of the State\n\nDivision of the Budget. (2)\n\nIf a\ncommunity support program, or a portion thereof, is transferred to another\nprovider which is not eligible for supplemental reimbursement pursuant to\nsubdivision (b) of this section, or is closed without transfer to another\nprovider, the State aid portion of grants pursuant to paragraph (d)(2) of this\nsection commensurate with the program transfer or closure shall be allocated, upon request by the local governmental unit, to the local governmental unit as\n\nState aid. If a provider offers community support program services solely\npursuant to a contract with the Office of Mental Health, such State aid shall\nbe allocated to the provider. State aid allocated pursuant to this paragraph\nshall be subject to the availability of appropriations in the Office of Mental\n\nHealth's budget and the approval of the director of the State Division of the\n\nBudget. (j) If a\nprovider operating a clinic treatment program, continuing day treatment program\nor a day treatment program licensed pursuant to Part 585 or 587 of this Title\nsubsequently closes all such programs, the State aid portion of grants pursuant\nto paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be allocated, upon request by the\nlocal governmental unit, to the local governmental unit as State aid. If a\nprovider offers community support program services solely pursuant to a\ncontract with the Office of Mental Health, such State aid shall be allocated to\nthe provider. State aid allocated pursuant to this subdivision shall be subject\nto the availability of appropriations in the Office of Mental Health's budget\nand the approval of the director of the State Division of the Budget. (k) Providers in receipt of supplemental\nreimbursement pursuant to this section shall: (1)\nassure that community support program\nservices for recipients who are eligible for medical assistance are provided\npursuant to the recommendation of a licensed practitioner, as defined in Part\n587 of this Title, and that there is a process for maintaining any records of\nsuch recommendations; and\n(2)\nsubmit to the Office of Mental Health or the local governmental unit, upon\nrequest, all cost, utilization, programmatic or clinical reports or\ndocumentation required. (l) In the event that the local share of the\nsupplemental medical assistance reimbursement commensurate with the grants\ndescribed in paragraph (d)(4) of this section exceeds the estimated local tax\nlevy portion of local aid, as described in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, for all eligible providers within the local governmental unit's jurisdiction, the State shall reimburse the local government for such excess, subject to the\navailability of appropriations in the Office of Mental Health's budget and the\napproval of the director of the State Division of the Budget. (m) Receipt of supplemental reimbursement\npursuant to this section shall not affect receipt of supplemental reimbursement\navailable to a provider pursuant to Part 592 of this Title. (n) Nothing in this section is intended to\nalter the existing role, responsibility or authority of local governmental\nunits pursuant to article 41 of the Mental Hygiene Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
