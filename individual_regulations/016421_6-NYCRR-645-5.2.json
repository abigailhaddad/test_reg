  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 645-5.2 - General requirements for applications\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following are general requirements for all\napplications for permits subject to this Subpart. (a) General requirements for a complete\napplication. In order to be determined complete for the purpose of commencing\nreview, the application for a permit must meet the following criteria: (1)\n\nThe application must include a complete\napplication on such form as the commission may prescribe, where\napplicable. (2)\n\nThe application\nmust be accompanied by the appropriate fee as specified in paragraph (b) of\nthis section. Subsequent review by the commission may require the imposition of\na special review fee pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section. (3)\n\nIf a project requires more than one\ncommission permit, the applicant must simultaneously submit all the necessary\napplications, or demonstrate to the commission's satisfaction that such is not\nnecessary. (4)\n\nWhen a project also\nrequires related permits from any other agency or government, the application\nmust include a list of such permits which the applicant knows to be required, and a statement of the status of approval and SEQR review of each at the time\nof filing the application with the commission. (5)\n\nThe application for a project subject to\nthe provisions of SEQR shall not be complete until: (i) a short or long EAF is filed with the\ncommission, as required by SEQR; (ii)\na lead agency has been designated\npursuant to SEQR; (iii)\nit has been\ndetermined whether the action may or will not have a significant effect on the\nenvironment, pursuant to SEQR; and\n(iv)\nif it has been determined that the\nproject may have a significant effect on the environment, a DEIS has been\naccepted by the lead agency which meets the requirements of SEQR. (6)\n\nIf a project is subject to the\nprovisions of the New York State Historic Preservation Act of 1980 (article 14\nof the Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation Law), the application is not\ncomplete until the process of consultation with the State Office of Parks and\n\nRecreation is complete, if required. (7)\n\nIf a project is subject to review by the\n\nAdirondack Park Agency, the New York State Department of Health, and/or the\ndepartment, the application for a commission permit shall not be considered\ncomplete until the applicant has submitted to all agencies applications for all\nrequired permits or demonstrates good cause to the commission's satisfaction\nthat such is not necessary. The commission may require the applicant to submit\ncopies of such applications to the commission. (b) Every person applying to the commission\nfor a permit, permit modification, or permit renewal shall pay, at the time the\npermit application is submitted to the commission, a nonrefundable basic\napplication review fee in accordance with the following schedule: (1)\npermit for erection of a sign\n$50.00\n(2)\npermit for a Class A\nMarina $100.00\n(3)\nspecial permit\nfor a new recreational use, seaplane, tour boat or parasail $100.00\n(4)\npermit for the construction or placement\nof a mooring $100.00\n(5)\npermit for\nthe construction of a wharf as follows: (i) modification to the size, shape or location of an existing wharf\n$50.00\n(ii)\nconstruction of new\nwharf (or wharves) $200.00\n(6)\npermit to construct a new or replacement\nwastewater treatment system $100.00\n(7)\nannual inspection and certification\npermit for wastewater treatment system as follows: (i) systems with a DAF <1,000 gallons\n$40.00\n(ii)\nsystems with a DAF\n>1,000 - <3,000 gallons $80.00\n(iii)\nsystems with a DAF >3,000 -\n<5,000 gallons $120.00\n(iv)\nsystems with a DAF >5,000 gallons $160.00\n(8)\n\nStormwater management permit as follows: (i) minor project $100.00\n(ii)\nmajor project $200.00\n(9)\n\nRenewal and modification of\nany permit issued $50.00\n(c) In addition to the fees provided in\nparagraph (b) of this section, the commission may charge a special review fee, not to exceed the amounts specified in section\n617.17\nof\nthis Title. A special review fee may be assessed whether the commission acts as\nlead agency or not, or otherwise acts under SEQR, but shall not be assessed\nunless the commission determines that the proposed activity will require\nexcessive staff resources or professional assistance to properly review the\napplication. Upon such a determination, the commission may condition its review\nof a permit application upon the payment of an appropriate sum for such\npurpose. (d) General conditions\nregarding fees. The following general conditions are applicable to fees for all\npermits included in this Subpart: (1)\n\nApplications must be accompanied by a check, money order or voucher, made\npayable to the Lake George Park Commission, for the total amount of all\napplication fees. Payment in cash will not be accepted in person. (2)\n\nIf an application is withdrawn at any\ntime, the basic application fee shall not be returned, but any unused portion\nof any special application fee shall be returned. (3)\n\nWhen a project involves two or more\napplications for which fees are required, the applicant shall pay a separate\nbasic application fee for each such application. (4)\n\nWhen an application is resubmitted in\nresponse to a notice of incompleteness, and no substantial changes in project\nnature and scope are involved, the resubmission shall not require any\nadditional application fees. (5)\n\nAn\napplicant may modify an application at any time prior to the issuance of a\npermit. When an application is revised, either in response to a notice of\nincompleteness or at the applicant's initiative, and the revision involves\nsubstantial change in the nature and/or scope of the project, it shall be\ntreated as a new application requiring new application fees. (6)\n\nNo fees shall be charged for applications\nrelated to activities and projects of departments and divisions of the New York\n\nState government or a municipality acting in a governmental capacity. (e) General conditions regarding\nminor projects. (1)\n\nThe commission has\nidentified certain activities as minor, as listed in section\n645-5.3\nof this Subpart. Minor projects usually have an insignificant environmental\nimpact. However, it is necessary to regulate such activities due to the\npotential for abuse of the resources of the park, the necessity for monitoring\nrelated activities, and the possible cumulative effect of minor actions which\nindividually are environmentally insignificant. (2)\n\nMinor projects are not normally subject\nto the public notice requirements, and may be processed faster than major\nprojects. (3)\n\nIf it is determined\nthat a minor project may have a significant effect on the environment under\nSEQR or otherwise, the project shall be processed as a major project under this\n\nSubpart. (4)\n\nWhen a project\ninvolves simultaneous permit applications for both major and minor activities, all are processed under the major project procedures of this Subpart. (5)\n\nWhen a project involves simultaneous\npermit applications for multiple activities, all of which are minor, all are\nprocessed as minor projects unless it is determined that the project may have a\nsignificant effect on the environment under SEQR or otherwise. (f) Joint proceedings. In some\ninstances, government agencies other than the commission may have concurrent\njurisdiction over a project. The commission may enter into agreement with such\nagencies for joint processing of the application, including provision for joint\nnotices and hearings. (g) Enforcement actions. If an enforcement action is initiated, pending or\noutstanding (including the failure of the applicant to comply with the\nrequirements of any outstanding order of the commission) against the applicant\nor any agent, affiliate or predecessor of the applicant, for a violation of\nECL, articles 43 and 71, title 33, or the rules or regulations promulgated\nthereunder, or any permits, certificates or orders issued by the commission, the commission may suspend all further processing and review of the application\npending final resolution of such action. Written notice of such action shall be\ngiven to the applicant. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
