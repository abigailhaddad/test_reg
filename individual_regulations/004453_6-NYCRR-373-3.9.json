  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.9 - Use and management of containers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to owners and\noperators of all hazardous waste facilities that store containers of hazardous\nwaste, except as section\n373-3.1\nof this Subpart provides\notherwise. (b) Condition of containers. If a container holding hazardous waste is not in good\ncondition, or if it begins to leak, the owner or operator must transfer the\nhazardous waste from this container to a container that is in good condition or\nmanage the waste in some other way that complies with the requirements of this\n\nSubpart. (c) Compatibility of waste with container. The owner or operator must use a container made of or\nlined with materials which will not react with, and are otherwise compatible\nwith, the hazardous waste to be stored, so that the ability of the container to\ncontain the waste is not impaired. (d) Management of containers. (1)\nA container holding hazardous waste must\nalways be closed during storage, except when it is necessary to add or remove\nwaste. (2)\nA container holding\nhazardous waste must not be opened, handled or stored in a manner which may\nrupture the container or cause it to leak. Comment: Reuse of containers in transportation is governed by U.S. Department of Transportation regulations, including those set forth in\n49 CFR\n173.28\n(see 6 NYCRR\n370.1\n[e]). (3)\n\nContainers\nholding hazardous waste must be marked with the words \"Hazardous Waste\" and\nwith other words identifying their contents. (e) Inspections. At least weekly, the owner or operator must inspect areas\nwhere containers are stored, looking for leaking containers and for\ndeterioration of containers caused by corrosion or other factors. Note: See subdivision (b) of this section for remedial action\nrequired if deterioration or leaks are detected. (f) Special requirements for ignitable\nor reactive waste. Containers holding ignitable or reactive waste must be\nlocated at least 15 meters (50 feet) from the facility property line (see\nsection\n373-3.2\n[h][1]\nof\nthis Subpart for additional requirements). (g) Special requirements for\nincompatible wastes. (1)\n\nIncompatible\nwastes, or incompatible wastes and materials (see Appendix 29, infra, for examples), must not be placed in the same\ncontainer, unless section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (2)\n\nHazardous waste must not be placed in an unwashed container that previously\nheld an incompatible waste or material (see Appendix 29, infra, for examples), unless section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (3)\nA storage container holding a hazardous waste that is incompatible with any\nwaste or other materials stored nearby in other containers, piles, open tanks\nor surface impoundments must be separated from the other materials or protected\nfrom them by means of a dike, berm, wall or other device. Note: The purpose of this is to prevent fires, explosions, gaseous emissions, leaching, or other discharge of hazardous waste or hazardous\nwaste constituents which could result from the mixing of incompatible wastes or\nmaterials if containers break or leak. (h) Air emission standards. The owner or operator shall manage all hazardous waste\nplaced in a container in accordance with the applicable requirements of\nsections\n373-3.27, 373-3.28 and\n373-3.29\nof this\n\nSubpart.
