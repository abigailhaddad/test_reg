  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 629.1 - Eligibility Determination Process\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. OPWDD will determine whether individuals are eligible for OPWDD operated, certified, funded and/or authorized services (hereinafter \"services\")\n(b) General Eligibility Provisions\n(1)\n\nEligibility is determined by the\napplication of consistent criteria based on the definition of developmental\ndisability established in Mental Hygiene Law (MHL) section 1.03(22). (2)\n\nProvisional Eligibility\n(i) Provisional eligibility may be determined\nin children, up to the age of seven, who manifest substantial delays, with or\nwithout specific congenital or acquired conditions that result in a high\nprobability of a developmental disability if services are not provided, and\nwhose condition and/or functioning may improve significantly over time, as a\nresult of treatments and services. They must also be a New York State resident\nor intend to reside in New York State at the time that services are\ndelivered. (ii)\n\nProvisionally\neligible children who reach their 7th birthday cannot be authorized for\nadditional services until a final eligibility determination has been made by\nOPWDD, except in extraordinary circumstances upon the approval of the\n\nCommissioner or their designee. (iii)\n\nProvisional eligibility must be\nredetermined by a child's 8th birthday. Children 7 years and older seeking\nOPWDD services must meet full OPWDD eligibility criteria. (3)\nOPWDD may review or re-review an\nindividual's eligibility at any time. Applicants determined ineligible may\nreapply for services upon receipt of new or differing information that supports\neligibility at any time. (4)\nOPWDD, through its Developmental Disabilities Regional Office (DDRO), is\nresponsible for determining whether a person is eligible for OPWDD services. A\nThree-Step process, as described herein, is used by OPWDD to make an\neligibility determination of developmental disability. (5)\nA determination that a person is eligible\nto receive OPWDD services based on the individual meeting the criteria for a\ndevelopmental disability does not mean the person is automatically eligible for\nall OPWDD services, as some OPWDD services have additional eligibility\ncriteria. (c) Eligibility\n\nDetermination Process\n(1)\n\nEligibility\n\nRequest. (i) A request for eligibility in a\nform and format specified by OPWDD must accompany all requests submitted to the\nDDRO for eligibility determinations. The request for eligibility includes the\nname of the person, the name of the person's representative, and relevant\ncontact information. The request for eligibility also includes documentation of\nthe person's developmental disability including information related to\ncondition/diagnosis, standardized intelligence testing, standardized measures\nof adaptive functioning, information related to history and presence of\ndisability prior to age 22, a full report of all contemporary diagnoses or\nclassifications of health, physical, developmental, or psychiatric conditions\nthat are relevant to the determination of eligibility, and other information\nthat may be requested by OPWDD. (2)\n1st Step Review. (i) DDRO staff review the eligibility request\nfor completeness and share the information with staff designated by the\n\nDirector, as necessary. After this review, the DDRO notifies the person in\nwriting that: (a) Eligibility or provisional\neligibility has been determined; or\n(b) The request requires additional\ndocumentation; or\n(c) The request\nhas been forwarded for a 2nd Step Review. (3)\n2nd Step Review. (i) DDRO clinicians designated by the DDRO\nDirector conduct a 2nd Step Review of the eligibility request forwarded by the\n1st Step Review, along with any additional documentation provided by the\nperson. If these clinicians require additional information, the person is\nnotified in writing of the type of information needed and the date by which it\nmust be submitted to the DDRO. (ii)\n\nFollowing the 2nd Step Review, the DDRO provides the individual with written\nnotification of its determination. If the person is found ineligible for OPWDD\nservices because he or she does not meet the criteria for a developmental\ndisability, as defined in MHL Section 1.03(22) and associated guidelines, the\nletter shall offer the person and his or her representative the opportunity to: (a) Meet with DDRO staff to discuss the\ndetermination and documentation reviewed; and/or\n(b) Request a 3rd Step Review; and/or\n(c) Request a Medicaid Fair\n\nHearing in cases where Medicaid funded services are sought. (iii)\nA Notice of Decision informing the\nperson of his or her right to request a Medicaid fair hearing is sent only when\nthe request for services indicates that the person is interested in receiving\n\nMedicaid funded services if determined eligible. If the person has not\nindicated Medicaid funded services, no fair hearing is required and the\ndecision of the DDRO is final. (iv)\n\nIf a fair hearing is requested, a 3rd\n\nStep Review will automatically be conducted. (4)\n3rd Step Review. (i) 3rd Step Eligibility Determination\n\nCommittee conducts the 3rd Step Reviews. Committee members include licensed\npractitioners who are not directly involved in the determinations made at the\n1st and 2nd Step Reviews. The Committee reviews the submitted eligibility\nrequest and any additional documentation provided by or on behalf of the per\nson. The Committee forwards its recommendations to the DDRO. The DDRO considers\nthe 3rd Step recommendations and informs the person of any change in the DDRO's\ndetermination. 3rd Step Reviews will be made prior to any fair hearing\ndate\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp.
