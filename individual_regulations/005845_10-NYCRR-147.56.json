Y. (b) [Definitions.]\n(1)\n\nThe term reservoir wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refers to the pressure equalizing reservoir now used for the storage of water of this public water supply or to any additional reservoir which may be constructed or used for the purpose of this public water supply. (2)\n\nWherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a well or reservoir is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of such reservoir or to the edge of such well. (c) Privies adjacent to any well or reservoir. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 50 feet of any well of the public water supply of the Huntington Water Works Company. (2)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 200 feet of any well of the public water supply of the Huntington Water Works Company. (3)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind, placed or or used for the temporary storage of human excreta, located between the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subdivision, shall be arranged in such a manner that all excreta shall be received in suitable watertight receptacles and shall at all times be deposited as set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nThe excreta collected in the aforesaid removable receptacles shall be removed and the receptacles cleaned and disinfected as often as may be found necessary in order to maintain the privy in proper sanitary condition and to effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundations or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises or of the adjoining premises. (5)\n\nUnless otherwise specifically ordered or permitted by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid receptacles shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits at a depth of not less than 12 inches below the surface of the ground and in such manner as to effectually prevent them being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at a distance not less than 500 feet from any well of the public water supply of the Huntington Water Works Company. (6)\n\nWhenever it shall be found that, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local condition, the excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal may, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, be washed over the surface or through the soil into any well of the public water supply of the Huntington Water Works Company, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the trench or place of disposal shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health.

(2)\n\nNo garbage, putrescible matter, kitchen or sink wastes, refuse or waste matter from any dairy, cheese factory nor water in which milk cans, utensils, clothing, bedding, carpets or harness have been washed or rinsed nor any polluted water or liquid of any kind shall be thrown, discharged or allowed to escape or remain upon the surface of the ground or into the ground beneath the surface within 100 feet of any well of the public water supply of the Huntington Water Works Company.

(2)\n\nNo human excreta and no compost or other matter containing human excreta shall be thrown, placed or allowed to escape into any well or reservoir, nor shall such human excreta or compost or other matter containing human excreta be buried in the soil at a less depth than 12 inches below the surface of the ground nor within a distance of 500 feet of any well of the public water supply of the Huntington Water Works Company and no manure or compost of any kind shall be placed, piled or spread upon the ground within a distance of 75 feet of any well of the public water supply of the Huntington Water Works Company.
