  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 541.6 - Furlough order\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A furlough\norder must be obtained before a defendant in the custody of the commissioner\npursuant to a commitment order, recommitment order or retention order may leave\nthe facility for any period of time up to 14 days, with or without the constant\nsupervision of one or more facility employees. Temporary absence from the\nfacility for medical treatment, court appearance or to attend the funeral of an\nimmediate family member does not require a furlough order. (b) The Director of Forensic Services may\napply to the court which issued the commitment or recommitment order, or a\nsuperior court in the county in which the facility is located, for a furlough\norder upon the recommendation of the clinical director after consultation with\nthe hospital forensics committee. (c) The application shall be made on forms\njointly approved by the commissioner and the Office of Court Administration and\nshall be accompanied by a current psychiatric report. The commissioner shall\ngive written notice of the application to the district attorney, the defendant, the counsel for the defendant and the Mental Health Information\n\nService. (d) The Director of\n\nForensics Services shall apply for a furlough order only if the current\npsychiatric reports support the view that issuance of the order is warranted by\nthe clinical condition of the defendant and would be consistent with the public\nsafety and welfare of the community and defendant. The treatment team leader or\na psychiatrist or psychologist familiar with the defendant's current mental\ncondition and case history shall be prepared to testify in support of the\napplication for a furlough order. The Director of Forensic Services shall make\nrecommendations of terms and conditions to the court. (e) Upon issuance of the furlough order, the\nclinical director shall extend to the defendant the privileges authorized by\nsuch order, but only to the extent and for the duration so authorized. If a\nchange in the defendant's condition warrants suspension of the privileges\nauthorized by the furlough order, the clinical director shall so inform the\n\nDirector of Forensic Services and may, in the event of an emergency, immediately suspend the privileges. (f) If the defendant fails to return to the\nfacility at the time specified in the furlough order, he shall be deemed to\nhave escaped and the procedures described in section\n541.12\nof this Part shall be\nfollowed.
