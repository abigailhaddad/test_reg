Tit. 7 § 110.1 - Interpretation of age range provisions set forth in this chapter\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The age ranges\nset forth in this Chapter are basically indicators of inmate maturity level. In\nany case where an inmate is not within the age range specified for an\ninstitution, such inmate may nevertheless be confined therein upon specific\nwritten approval of the Director of Classification and Movement or his designee\nif said institution is deemed appropriate for the inmate's supervision or\noffers a program that can be of benefit to the health, care or rehabilitation\nof the inmate. (b) Wherever the age\nrange of persons who may be confined in an institution is specified in this\n\nChapter, the following rules of interpretation shall apply: (1)\n\nThe age specifications are keyed to\nbirthdates and a person no longer falls within the range specified when he has\nattained the oldest age set forth in the range. (For example, a person who has\nreached his 18th birthday shall not be considered to be between 16 and 18 years\nof age); (2)\n\nExcept in the case of\nreception centers, the age specifications are keyed to age as of admission to\nan institution, and an inmate who is admitted to an institution while within\nthe age range specified in this Chapter may be confined therein notwithstanding\nthe fact that he is older than the age range specified for the institution; and\n(3)\n\nIn the case of reception\ncenters, the age specifications are keyed to age as of the date the sentence of\nimprisonment was imposed. (c) In any case where an institution is\ndesignated as one that may be used for reception or confinement of persons who\nare 16 years of age, such institution also may be used for reception or\nconfinement as the case may be of persons who are 15 years of age and who are\nreceived by the department pursuant to commitment by the Family Court or\npursuant to transfer from another State agency.
