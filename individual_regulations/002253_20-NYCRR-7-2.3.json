(2)\n\nSuch report will be considered as the\namendment permitted by section\n7-2.2\nof this Subpart to be filed\non or before the 15th day of the twelfth month of the calendar year or fiscal\nyear if the tax shown on the report is greater than the estimate shown on the\ndeclaration previously made. (3)\n\nExamples. Example 1: A taxpayer that reports on the basis of a\ncalendar year first meets the requirement for making a declaration of estimated\ntax on September 7, 2021. The taxpayer may satisfy the requirements for making\na declaration of estimated tax by making and filing its report for the 2021\ntaxable year on or before February 15, 2022, and paying, at the time of filing, the balance, if any, of the full amount of tax shown to be payable. The report\nwill be treated as the declaration required to be filed on or before December\n15, 2021. Example 2: The taxpayer makes and files, on or before\n\nSeptember 15, 2021, a timely declaration of estimated tax for such year, and, on or before February 15, 2022, files its 2021 tax report and pays the balance, if any, of the full amount of tax shown to be payable.
