Such credit may be claimed in the\ntaxable year that corresponds to the allocation year specified on the\ncertificate of tax credit issued to the qualified life sciences\ncompany. (b) (1)\n\nFor a qualified life sciences company\nthat employs 10 or more persons during the taxable year, the amount of the\ncredit shall be equal to 15 percent of such qualified life sciences company's\nresearch and development expenditures in this State for the taxable year. For a\nqualified life sciences company that employs less than 10 persons during the\ntaxable year, the amount of the credit shall be equal to 20 percent of such\nqualified life sciences company's research and development expenditures in this\n\nState for the taxable year. (2)\n\nThe\ncredit shall be allowed only with respect to the first taxable year during\nwhich the criteria set forth in subdivision (a) of section\n43\nof the Tax Law are satisfied, and with\nrespect to each of the two taxable years next following (but only, with respect\nto each of such years, if such criteria are satisfied). Subsequent\ncertifications of the life sciences company by the Department of Economic\n\nDevelopment pursuant to this section shall not extend the three taxable year\ntime limitation on the allowance of the credit set forth in the preceding\nsentence. (c) For\npurposes of the credit allowed under this section, the number of persons\nemployed by a qualified life sciences company during the taxable year shall be\ndetermined by ascertaining the number of such individuals employed full-time by\nsuch company, excluding general executive officers, on the 31st day of March, the 30th day of June, the 30th day of September and the 31st day of December\nduring each taxable year, by adding together the number of such individuals\nascertained on each of such dates and dividing the sum so obtained by the\nnumber of such dates occurring within such taxable year. An individual employed\nfull-time means an employee in a job consisting of at least 35 hours per week, or 2 or more employees who are in jobs that together constitute the equivalent\nof a job of at least 35 hours per week (full-time equivalent). (d) The total amount of credit allowable to a\nqualified life sciences company, or, if the life sciences company is properly\nincluded or required to be included in a combined report, to the combined\ngroup, taken in the aggregate, shall not exceed $500,000 in any taxable year. If the life sciences company is a partner in a partnership or shareholder of a\n\nNew York S corporation, then the total amount of credit allowable shall be\napplied at the entity level, so that the total amount of credit allowable to\nall the partners or shareholders of each such entity, taken in the aggregate, does not exceed $500,000 in any taxable year. (e) No research and development expenditures\nmade by the life sciences company and used either as the basis for the\nallowance of the credit provided for pursuant to section\n43\nof the Tax Law or used in the calculation\nof the credit provided pursuant to section\n43\nof the Tax Law shall be used to claim any\nother credit allowed pursuant to the Tax Law or be used in the calculation of\nany other credit allowed pursuant to the Tax Law.
