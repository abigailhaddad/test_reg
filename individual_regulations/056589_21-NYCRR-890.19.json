  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 890.19 - Payment for use of surface water\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Contracts. The commission will require contracts, which may be negotiated at\nany time, for the use, withdrawal, or diversion of any surface water of the\nbasin taken after the effective date of the rates and charges required by these\nregulations. Each of such contracts shall include: (1)\n\nAn undertaking by the contracting party\nto pay for water used, withdrawn, or diverted, in accordance with the rates and\ncharges established by the commission pursuant to these regulations. (2)\n\nProvision for a minimum annual payment\nunder the contract, in accordance with an estimated annual demand schedule, regardless of use, withdrawal, or diversion. (3)\n\nSuch other and different terms and\nconditions with respect to the availability of the supply, its quantity and\nquality, its management and control, and the powers and duties and obligations\nof the parties, as may be negotiated. (b) Rates and charges. Rates and charges for\nwater supplied will include all costs associated with making the basin water\nsupply available and maintaining its continued availability in adequate\nquantity and quality over time. Rates will be determined as follows: (1)\n\nThe commission will use the\nweighted-average unit cost of all water stored by or on behalf of the\ncommission. The unit cost of water will be determined by dividing all of the\ncommission's annual project cost by the net yield of the water supply in\n\nFederal reservoirs authorized in the Commission's Comprehensive Plan. Costs, rates, and charges will be recomputed whenever new or additional storage is\nprovided and as often as necessary to reflect relevant changes in any cost\ncomponents associated with sustaining specified base flows. (2)\n\nThe commission will collect sufficient\nannual revenue to meet all of its annual project costs, including debt service, operation, maintenance, replacement, reserves, and associated administrative\ncosts. The minimum charge to specified users will be for the amount of water\nspecified in an estimated demand schedule according to a contractual agreement. The maximum charge to these users will be for the amount of water they actually\nuse, withdraw, or divert. Revenue not collected from specific users of water\nsupply will be collected for the states in which general benefits of water\nsupply occur. (3)\n\nThe commission\nwill compute an annual adjusted rate in the form of a rebate to each\ncontracting party of a pro rata distribution of the net annual revenues of the\ncommission in excess of the amounts required under paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, provided that no such rebate will be made with respect to revenues\nreceived by the commission on account of consumptive uses and exportations out\nof the basin, and provided further that no rebates will be made until there are\nno further annual costs allocated to the signatory states as general\nbeneficiaries. (4)\n\nThe commission\nmay make reasonable estimates of the components of combined withdrawals where\nseparate water accounting is not feasible, such as for combination of\nexportations and in-basin use and consumptive and non-consumptive uses, and for\nmunicipal systems. (5)\n\nThe\ncommission may exempt or classify such non-consumptive uses of surface flows as\nit may determine to have no substantial effect on the water resources of the\nbasin. It may also provide for a reduced rate structure with respect to water\nused for cooling purposes which is returned to a stream otherwise unimpaired in\nquantity and quality. The commission may also classify rates and charges for\nconsumptive uses and out-of-basin exportations of surface waters to include a\nsurcharge to reflect any costs or adverse effects of such uses which are\ngreater in kind or degree than those associated with other water\nuses. (6)\n\nThe rates and charges for\nincreased in-stream evaporative losses resulting from heated discharges will be\nthe same as those for a consumptive use. (c) Special projects. Charges for water\nsupply from projects constructed pursuant to contractual arrangements between\nthe commission and local public agencies in advance of the time when the\nproject is scheduled by the commission in accordance with section\n890.16\nof this Part will be at\nrates sufficient to provide the total annual debt service and other obligations\nincurred by the commission for such project, until such time as the project\nqualifies for commission scheduling under the provisions of section\n890.16\nof this Part. (d) Sanctions for unauthorized use of water. The commission will provide by regulation for the imposition of sanctions for\nany unauthorized use, withdrawal, or diversion of surface waters of the basin\nand for the assessment and collection of the value thereof. (e) Effective date of rates and charges. Rates and charges required by section\n890.19\n(b) of this\n\nPart shall apply to all surface waters of the basin used, withdrawn, or\ndiverted by any person, corporation or other entity, public or private, on and\nafter the date of the first impoundment of water for water supply purposes at\nthe Beltzville Reservoir, except that there shall be no charge to a person, corporation or other entity for water used, withdrawn, or diverted at a monthly\nvolume which is not greater than the average monthly volume taken or legally\nentitled to be taken by such person, corporation, or other entity during the 12\ncompleted calendar months next preceding the effective date of these\nregulations. (The effective date of charges was established by Resolution No. 74-6, adopted May 22, 1974.)\n(f) Legal entitlement. \"Legally entitled to be taken\" refers to water taken under\nthe following conditions: (1)\nA valid and\nsubsisting permit, issued under the authority of one of the signatory\nparties. (2)\n\nPhysical facilities in\nbeing and operable as required for such taking. (3)\nA beneficial use throughout the year for\nthe waters taken. (4)\n\nThat such\ntakings are within the limits of the total allocable flow without\naugmentation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n890.19\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
