(d) An\noperator must not enter into any contract or agreement with the resident or the\nresident's next of kin or sponsor for life care of the resident in the enriched\nhousing program. (e) Termination of admission agreements. (1)\n\nEvery resident has the right to terminate\nhis/her admission agreement. (2)\n\nWhere notice of termination has been given by the operator and the resident\nleaves voluntarily, it is not necessary for the operator to commence a special\nproceeding pursuant to paragraph (15) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nNo operator may terminate an admission\nagreement and involuntarily discharge a resident except for the following\nreasons: (i) the resident requires continual\nmedical or nursing care; (ii)\nthe\nresident requires services or supervision that cannot be provided or arranged\nfor by the operator; (iii)\nthe\nresident's behavior poses imminent risk of death or imminent risk of serious\nphysical harm to himself/herself or anyone else; (iv)\nthe resident fails to make timely\npayment for all authorized charges, expenses, and other assessments, if any, for services including use and occupancy of the premises, materials, equipment\nand food which the resident has agreed to pay pursuant to the resident's\nadmission agreement; (v) the\nresident repeatedly behaves in a manner that directly impairs the well-being, care or safety of the resident or any other resident or which substantially\ninterferes with the orderly operation of the enriched housing\nprogram; (vi)\nthe enriched housing\nprogram has had its operating certificate limited, revoked or temporarily\nsuspended or the operator has voluntarily surrendered the operating certificate\nof the enriched housing program to the department; or\n(vii)\na receiver has been appointed pursuant\nto the provisions of section\n461-f\nof\nthe Social Services Law and is providing for the orderly transfer of all\nresidents in the enriched housing program to other facilities or is making\nother provision for the resident's continued safety and\ncare. (4)\n\nIf failure to\nmake timely payment resulted from an interruption in the receipt by the\nresident of any public benefits to which he/she is entitled, no admission\nagreement may be involuntarily terminated unless the operator, during the\n30-day notice period, assists the resident in obtaining such benefits, or any\nother available supplemental public benefits. Documented failure of the\nresident to cooperate with such efforts by the operator is considered evidence\nof assistance. (5)\n\nIn order to\nterminate the admission agreement of a resident and discharge him/her from the\nenriched housing program, the operator of an enriched housing program must give\nat least 30 days written notice, on a form prescribed by the department, to: (i) the resident; (ii)\nthe resident's next of kin, if known; and\n(iii)\nany person designated in\nthe admission agreement as the responsible party other than next of kin, if\nany. (6)\n\nThe termination\nnotice must indicate: (i) the reason for\ntermination; (ii)\nthe date of\ntermination; (iii)\nthat the\nresident has the right to object to the termination of the agreement and the\nsubsequent discharge; and\n(iv)\nthat\nif the resident does object, he/she may remain in the enriched housing program\nwhile the operator commences a special proceeding pursuant to paragraph (15) of\nthis subdivision only until such time that the court finds in favor of the\noperator. (7)\n\nIn addition\nto the prescribed termination notice, the operator must furnish to the resident\na list of agencies, including the Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program, which\nprovide free legal services, and agencies engaged in resident advocacy services\nwithin the geographic vicinity of the enriched housing program. Such lists must\nbe provided or approved by the department and must include names, addresses and\ntelephone numbers of the advocacy program. (8)\nA copy of the termination notice must be\nfiled by the operator with the appropriate regional office of the department\nwithin five days after the notice is served upon the resident. (9)\n\nTransfer of a resident may be arranged\nwithout 30 days notice under the following circumstances: (i) when a resident develops a communicable\ndisease, medical or mental conditions, or sustains an injury such that\ncontinual skilled medical and nursing services are required, arrangements must\nbe made by the operator for appropriate professional evaluation and transfer to\nan appropriate facility; and\n(ii)\nin the event that a resident's behavior poses an imminent risk of death or\nimminent risk of serious physical harm to himself/herself or others, the\noperator must arrange for transfer of the individual to an appropriate and safe\nlocation; in the event that a resident's behavior poses an imminent risk of\ndeath or serious physical harm to himself/herself or any other person, the\noperator should, whenever possible, seek the assistance of a peace officer, acting pursuant to the officer's special duties, or a police officer who is a\nmember of an authorized police department or force or a sheriff's department, in transferring the resident to a safe location. (10)\n\nWhen the basis for a transfer no longer\nexists, and the resident is deemed appropriate for placement in the enriched\nhousing program, the operator must re-admit the resident, as long as the\ninvoluntary termination proceedings have not been completed. (11)\n\nTransfer of a resident without notice of\ntermination is not deemed a termination of the admission agreement. Such\ntransfer does not relieve the operator from the requirement of proceeding, subsequent to the removal of the resident, to terminate the admission\nagreement. (12)\n\nWhen the operator\nproceeds to terminate the admission agreement of a resident transferred without\nnotice of termination, the operator must arrange for the written notice to be\nhand-delivered to the resident at the location to which he/she has been\nremoved. If such hand-delivery is not possible, the notice must be given by any\nof the methods provided by law for personal service upon a natural person\n(section 308, Civil Practice Law and Rules). (13)\n\nWhen a receiver has been appointed\npursuant to the provisions of section\n461-f\nof\nthe Social Services Law and is providing for the orderly transfer of all\nresidents in the enriched housing program to other facilities or is making\nother provisions for the residents' continued safety and care, the receiver may\nterminate admission agreements and arrange for the transfer of all residents to\nappropriate settings without regard to the notice and court review requirements\nof this subdivision. (14)\n\nExcept as\ndescribed in paragraph (11) of this subdivision, a receiver must adhere to the\nrequirements of this subdivision in any instance where termination of an\nadmission agreement is not directly related to the closure of an enriched\nhousing program. (15)\n\nIf the\nresident indicates to the operator within 30 days of receipt of notice that\nhe/she objects to the termination of the agreement or if at the end of 30 days\nthe resident remains in the enriched housing program, the operator must\ninstitute a special proceeding pursuant to section\n461-h\nof\nthe Social Services Law prior to termination and discharge. (16)\n\nWhile legal action is in progress, the\noperator must not: (i) seek to amend the\nadmission agreement in effect as of the date of the notice of\ntermination; (ii)\nfail to provide\nany of the care and services required by department regulations and the\nadmission agreement; or\n(iii)\nengage in any action to intimidate or harass the resident. (17)\n\nBoth the resident and the operator are\nfree to seek any judicial relief to which they may be entitled. (18)\n\nThe operator must assist any resident\nproposed to be transferred or discharged pursuant to this subdivision to the\nextent necessary to assure, whenever practicable, the resident's placement in\ncare settings which are adequate, appropriate and consistent with the\nresident's wishes. (19)\n\nIn the\nevent that an enriched housing resident holds a separate lease for the\napartment he/she occupies, termination of the admission agreement does not\nconstitute termination of the lease.
