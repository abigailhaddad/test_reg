  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 1-2.10 - Foreign corporations - Public Law 86-272\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pursuant to\n\nPublic Law\n86-272 (15 U.S.C.A. sections\n381\n-\n384\n), a\nforeign corporation is exempt from the tax imposed by article 9-A if its\nactivities are limited to those described in that law. Thus, to be exempt under\n\nPublic Law\n86-272, the activities of the corporation in New\n\nYork State must be limited to one or more of the following: (1)\nthe solicitation of orders by employees\nor representatives in New York State for sales of tangible personal property, if the orders are sent outside New York State for approval or rejection and, if\napproved, are filled by shipment or delivery from a point outside New York\n\nState; (2)\nthe solicitation of\norders for sales of tangible personal property by employees or representatives\nin New York State in the name of or for the benefit of a prospective customer\nof such corporation, if the customer's orders to the corporation are sent\noutside New York State for approval or rejection and, if approved, are filled\nby shipment or delivery from a point outside New York State; and\n(3)\nthe solicitation of orders via the\n\nInternet in New York State for sales of tangible personal property, if the\norders are sent outside New York State for approval or rejection and, if\napproved, are filled by shipment or delivery from a point outside New York\n\nState. (b) For purposes\nof this exemption, a corporation will not be considered to have engaged in\ntaxable activities in New York State during the taxable year merely by reason\nof sales in New York State or the solicitation of orders for sales in New York\n\nState, of tangible personal property on behalf of the corporation by one or\nmore independent contractors. A corporation will not be considered to have\nengaged in taxable activities in New York State by reason of maintaining an\noffice in New York State by one or more independent contractors whose\nactivities on behalf of the corporation in New York State consist solely of\nmaking sales, or soliciting orders for sales, of tangible personal\nproperty. (c) The term \"\nindependent contractor\" means a commission agent, broker, or other independent\ncontractor who is engaged in selling, or in soliciting orders for the sale of\ntangible personal property for more than one principal and who holds himself\nout as such in the regular course of his business activities. The term\n\"representative\" does not include an independent contractor. (d) In order to be exempt by virtue of\n\nPublic Law\n86-272, the activities in New York State of\nemployees or representatives, or activities engaged in via the Internet, must\nbe limited to the solicitation of orders for the sale of tangible personal\nproperty. The solicitation of orders includes offering tangible personal\nproperty for sale or pursuing offers for the purchase of tangible personal\nproperty and those ancillary activities, other than maintaining an office, that\nserve no independent business function apart from their connection to the\nsolicitation of orders. Examples of activities performed by such employees or\nrepresentatives in New York State, or that are engaged in via the Internet, that are entirely ancillary to the solicitation of orders include: (1)\nthe use of free samples and other\npromotional materials in connection with the solicitation of orders; (2)\npassing product inquiries and complaints\nto the corporation's home office; (3)\nusing autos furnished by the\ncorporation; (4)\nadvising customers\non the display of the corporation's products and furnishing and setting up\ndisplay racks; (5)\nrecruitment, training and evaluation of sales representatives; (6)\nuse of hotels and homes for sales-related\nmeetings; (7)\nintervention in\ncredit disputes; (8)\nuse of space\nat the salesperson's home solely for the salesperson's convenience. (However, see subdivision (g) of this section as to loss of immunity for maintaining an\noffice.); (9)\nparticipating in a\ntrade show or shows, provided that participation is for not more than 14 days, or part thereof, in the aggregate during the corporation's taxable year for\n\nFederal income tax purposes. (However, see subdivision (g) of this section as\nto loss of immunity for maintaining an office.)\n(e) The exemption under the provisions of\n\nPublic Law\n86-272is limited to the solicitation of orders for\nthe sale of tangible personal property and does not include the solicitation of\norders for the sale of services or intangible property. (f) Activities in New York State beyond the\nsolicitation of orders will subject a corporation to tax in New York State\nunless such activities are de minimis. Activities will not be considered de\nminimis if such activities establish a nontrivial additional connection with\n\nNew York State. Solicitation activities do not include those activities that\nthe corporation would have reason to engage in apart from the solicitation of\norders, but chooses to allocate to its New York State sales force, or to engage\nin via the Internet, including interacting with customers or potential\ncustomers through the corporation's website or computer application. However, a\ncorporation will not be made taxable solely by presenting static text or images\non its website. In determining whether a corporation's activities exceed the\nsolicitation of orders, all of the corporation's activities in New York State\nwill be considered. Examples of activities that go beyond the solicitation of\norders include: (1)\nmaking repairs to or\ninstalling the corporation's products; (2)\nmaking credit investigations; (3)\ncollecting delinquent accounts; (4)\ntaking inventory of the corporation's\nproducts for customers or prospective customers; (5)\nreplacing the corporation's stale or\ndamaged products; (6)\ngiving\ntechnical advice on the use of the corporation's products after the products\nhave been delivered to the customer. (g) Maintaining an office, shop, warehouse or\nstock of goods in New York State will make a corporation taxable. However, a\ncorporation will not be made taxable solely by maintaining a supply of goods in\n\nNew York State if such goods are used only as free samples in connection with\nthe solicitation of orders. A corporation will be considered to be maintaining\nan office in New York State if the space is held out to the public as an office\nor place of business of the taxpayer. For example, a salesperson's house is\nused for business and meets the criteria to be considered a bona fide employer\noffice for personal income tax purposes. The residence will be treated as an\noffice of the corporation, and the corporation will be taxable. (h) A corporation (other than a corporation\nthat cannot be included in a combined report under section 210-C(2)(c) and\nsection\n6-2.6\nof this Subchapter) may be\nincluded in a combined report required under section 210-C, even if it is\nexempt from taxation under article 9-A pursuant to the provisions of\n\nPublic Law\n86-272, as described in this section. In addition, the receipts of such a corporation will be included in determining whether a\nunitary group is deriving receipts from activity in this state. However, if all\nthe members of such a unitary group are exempt from taxation under article 9-A\npursuant to the provisions of\n\nPublic Law\n86-272, as described in this section, then the\nunitary group would not be required to file a combined report. (i) Examples. The following are examples of foreign corporations that\neither are exempt or not exempt from tax under this section. Each of these\nexamples is for illustration purposes only and is intended to be applicable\nonly to the specific activity identified in each example. Example 1: A foreign manufacturing corporation has its\nfactory outside New York State. Its only activity in New York State is the\nsolicitation of orders for its products through a sales office located in New\n\nYork State. The orders are forwarded to its home office outside New York State\nfor acceptance and the merchandise is shipped by common carrier from the\nfactory direct to the purchasers. The corporation is subject to tax. Example 2: A foreign corporation t h a t operates several\nretail stores outside New\n\nYork State leases an office in New York City for the\nconvenience of its buyers when they come to New York State. Salespeople call at\nthe office to solicit orders. The merchandise is shipped by the sellers\ndirectly to the offices of the corporation outside New York State. The\ncorporation is subject to tax. Example 3: A foreign corporation sends salespeople into\n\nNew York State to solicit orders. The orders must be accepted at the home\noffice of the corporation located in another state. The corporation displays\ngoods in New York City at a space leased occasionally and for short terms. The\ncorporation is subject to tax. Example 4: A foreign corporation has $950,000 of receipts\nfrom activities in New York State that consist solely of the solicitation of\norders by employees in New York State for sale of tangible personal property; all the orders are sent outside New York State for approval or rejection and, if approved, are filled by shipment from a point outside New York State. The\ncorporation also has $100,000 of New York receipts from the sale of services. The corporation is subject to tax. The corporation may not disclaim tax\nliability in New York State under this section, since its activities in New\n\nYork State are not limited to those described in this section. Example 5: Seven foreign corporations each have $200,000\nof receipts from activity in New York State and are part of the same unitary\ngroup that meets the ownership test under section 210-C and Subpart 6-2 of this\n\nSubchapter. Therefore, the seven corporations together exceed the $1 million\nreceipts threshold. Three members of the group have activities in New York\n\nState that consist solely of the solicitation of orders by employees in New\n\nYork State for sales of tangible personal property, which orders are sent\noutside New York State for approval or rejection and, if approved, are filled\nby shipment from a point outside New York State. These three corporations are\nnot subject to tax in New York State because their activities are limited to\nthose described in this section; the other four corporations are subject to tax\nbecause they are deriving receipts from activity in New York State and their\nactivities are not limited to those described in this section. The seven\ncorporations are required to file in a combined report, which will include the\nreceipts, net income, net gains, net losses, and net deductions of all the\ncorporations, together with their proportionate share of the unitary group's\nassets and liabilities. Example 6: A foreign corporation solicits sales of\ntangible personal property on its website and provides assistance to customers\nby posting a list of static frequently asked questions (\"FAQs\") and answers on\nthe corporation's website. Since this activity is de minimis under this\nsection, the corporation is exempt from tax under article 9-A. Example 7: A foreign corporation regularly provides\nassistance to its customers after its products have been delivered, either by\nemail or electronic \"chat\" that customers initiate by clicking on an icon on\nthe corporation's website. For example, the corporation regularly advises\ncustomers on how to use products after the products have been delivered. Since\nthis activity does not constitute, and is not entirely ancillary to, the\nsolicitation of orders for sales of tangible personal property, the corporation\nis not exempt from tax under this section. Example 8: A foreign corporation solicits and receives\nonline applications for its branded credit card via the corporation's website. The issued cards will generate interest income and fees for the corporation. Since this activity does not constitute, and is not entirely ancillary to, the\nsolicitation of orders for sales of tangible personal property, the corporation\nis not exempt from tax under this section. Example 9: A foreign corporation's website invites\nviewers in New York State to apply for non-sales positions with the\ncorporation. The website enables viewers to fill out and submit an electronic\napplication, as well as to upload a cover letter and resume. Since this\nactivity does not constitute, and is not entirely ancillary to, the\nsolicitation of orders for sales of tangible personal property, the corporation\nis not exempt from tax under this section. Example 10: A foreign corporation places Internet\n\"cookies\" onto the computers or other electronic devices of is customers. These\ncookies gather customer search information that will be used to adjust\nproduction schedules and inventory amounts, develop new products, or identify\nnew items to offer for sale. Since this activity does not constitute, and is\nnot entirely ancillary to, the solicitation of orders for sales of tangible\npersonal property, the corporation is not exempt from tax under this\nsection. Example 11: The same facts as example 10 except that the\ncookies gather customer information that is used only for purposes entirely\nancillary to the solicitation of orders for tangible personal property, such\nas: to remember items that customers have placed in their shopping cart during\na current web session, to store personal information customers have provided to\navoid the need for the customers to re-input the information when they return\nto the corporation's website, and to remind customers what products they have\nconsidered during previous sessions. The cookies perform no other function, and\nthese are the only types of cookies delivered by the corporation to the\ncomputers or other devices of its customers. Since this activity is entirely\nancillary to the solicitation of orders for sales of tangible personal\nproperty, the corporation, under the facts of this example, is exempt from tax\nunder this section. Example 12: A foreign corporation remotely fixes or\nupgrades products previously purchased by its customers by transmitting code or\nother electronic instructions to those products via the Internet. Since this\ndoes not constitute, and is not entirely ancillary to, the solicitation of\norders for sales of tangible personal property, the corporation is not exempt\nfrom tax under this section. Example 13: A foreign corporation offers and sells\nextended warranty plans through its website to New York State customers who\npurchase the corporation's products. Since this activity involves selling, or\noffering to sell, a service that is not entirely ancillary to the solicitation\nof orders for sales of tangible personal property, the corporation is not\nexempt from tax under this section. Example 14: A foreign corporation contracts with a\nmarketplace provider that facilitates the sale of the corporation's products on\nthe provider's online marketplace. The marketplace provider maintains\ninventory, including some of the corporation's products, at fulfillment centers\nin New York State. Since this activity involves the maintenance of the\ncorporation's products in New York State, the corporation is not exempt from\ntax under this section. Example 15: A foreign corporation that sells tangible\npersonal property via the Internet also contracts with New York State customers\nto stream videos and music to electronic devices for a fee. Since this activity\ninvolves streaming, which does not constitute the sale of tangible personal\nproperty, the corporation is not exempt from tax under this section. Example 16: A foreign corporation offers for sale only\nitems of tangible personal property on its website. The website enables\ncustomers to search for items, read product descriptions, select items for\npurchase, choose among delivery options, and pay for the items. The corporation\ndoes not engage in any activities in New York State that are not described in\nthis example. Since the corporation engages exclusively in activities in New\n\nYork State that either constitute solicitation of orders for sales of tangible\npersonal property or are entirely ancillary to solicitation, the corporation is\nexempt from tax under this section.
