  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 567.1 - Statement of policy\n\nState Regulations\n\nIt is the policy of the State of New York to recognize and\nreward management/confidential employees (M/C's) whose significant individual\nor team achievements go beyond the scope of normal duties or performance. The\npurpose of the Special Achievement Awards program is to serve as a positive\nmotivator for M/C's and thereby encourage initiative, innovation, productivity\nimprovement, and monetary savings in New York State. This is intended to be a\nhighly selective program in which less than one percent of the M/C group will\nbe selected as award recipients each year. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n567.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
