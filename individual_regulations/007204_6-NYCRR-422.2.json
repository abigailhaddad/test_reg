  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 422.2 - Mining plan, specific provisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The mining plan shall indicate: the general geographic location of the mine; an\noutline of the affected land; the location and description of topographic, cultural and land-use features within and adjacent to the affected land; a\ndescription of the existing condition of the ground surface at the mine\nincluding areas already mined or disturbed by mining activity; the applicant's\nproposed method of mining including proposals for minimizing the effect of\nmining on the environment and on the property, health, safety and general\nwelfare of the people of the State. (b) The graphic portion of the mining plan\nshall consist of a map or photograph prepared in accordance with section\n422.1\n(c) of this\n\nPart. The information to be presented in graphic form shall include: (1)\nan accurate geographic location of the\nmine; (2)\nthe location of adjacent\ntopographic, cultural and land-use features including, but not limited to, landforms, drainage, bodies of water, roads and buildings; (3)\nan outline of the affected land; and\n(4)\nthe location and size of\nthe following elements of mining: areas of mineral extraction or removal (cuts\nand excavations); areas of mineral preparation and processing (stockpiles, settling ponds and treatment facilities); haulageways; areas of mineral, refuse\nand spoil storage; repair and shipping areas; drainage and water control\nfeatures; and screening. (c) The written portion of the mining plan\nshall consist of a description of the mine and the mining method. The\ninformation to be presented in written form shall include: (1)\na description of the affected land\nindicating the present use of the land. The description shall also indicate the\npresent physical condition of the land including the existence of structures, vegetation and water cover; (2)\na\ndescription of the existing or proposed mine indicating if the operation is a\nsurface consolidated, surface unconsolidated or underground mine; (3)\na description of the mining method\nindicating the method of extraction, the sequence of cuts and excavations, the\ndisposition of materials other than through sale, exchange, commercial, industrial or municipal use, and the use of haulageways. The applicant shall be\ngoverned by the following standards when submitting the required information. (i) the method of extraction shall mean\nremoval such as by drilling and blasting, the use of mechanical equipment\n(backhoe, shovel, front end loader, dragline) or by dredging. (ii)\n\nAny cut or excavation within the permit\narea, whether it is for the purpose of gaining access to a mineral, mining a\nmineral, or of transporting a mineral shall be considered to affect the\nreclamation plan unless the applicant can demonstrate otherwise. Shafts, drifts, adits, tunnels, lifts, and inclines shall be considered types of cuts\nand excavations. (iii)\n\nThe\nperimeter of a temporary or permanent mine floor shall not be established\ncloser to either the property line most nearly adjacent to the affected land or\nto any easement within or adjacent to the affected land than the following: a\ndistance of 25 feet measured in a horizontal plane when the adjacent property\nor easement is at or below the proposed final elevation of the affected land; a\ndistance equal to the sum of 25 feet plus one and one-half times the height of\nthe mine face in an unconsolidated material or a distance equal to the sum of\n25 feet plus one and one-quarter times the height of the mine face in a\nconsolidated material, when the adjacent property is at a higher elevation than\nthe affected land. The applicant may, with the approval of the department, modify the distance requirements contained in this subparagraph. (iv)\n\nThe perimeter of a stockpile or spoil\nbank shall not be established closer to either the property line most nearly\nadjacent to the affected land or to any easement within or adjacent to the\naffected land than a distance of 25 feet. The applicant may, with the approval\nof the department, modify the distance requirement contained in this\nsubparagraph. (v) The disposition\nof all materials utilized during or resulting from mining shall be as follows: (a) All refuse which is removed from the site\nduring mining shall be disposed of in accordance with applicable rules and\nregulations of the department relative to solid waste management (refuse\ndisposal). (b) Materials which are\nto be disposed of during reclamation shall be stored or stockpiled either\nwithin the permit area or at some other location identified by the applicant. These materials shall be temporarily treated to prevent their becoming\nunstable, hazardous, a source of pollution of the environment, or damaging to\nother property. Such treatment may consist of stabilization by stockpiling, grading, natural or artificial covering, screening or any other effective\nmethod of achieving the required results. Final treatment of these materials\nshall be in accordance with the requirements for reclaiming the affected land\nas contained in section\n422.3\nof this Part. (vi)\n\nPlans for the use and\ntreatment of haulageways shall provide for the control of drainage, air and\nwater pollution and erosion where such features or processes affect or are\nlikely to affect the surrounding property. (4)\nA description of the applicant's proposed\nmethod for preventing pollution, reducing soil erosion, and minimizing the\neffect of mining on the people of the State shall be required when and to the\nextent necessary to achieve compliance with the regulations of the department\nrelative to: land use; air and water quality; solid waste management; the use\nand protection of waters; the protection of the natural resources of the State\nincluding soil, forests, water, fish, wildlife, and all aquatic or terrestrial\nrelated environment, and to any other applicable standards. The following\nmethods, a combination thereof, or equally effective substitutes, may be\nutilized to accomplish the above stated objectives: (i) Dust and noise control--may be provided\nby the utilization of water and chemicals for dust control; through the\nutilization of equipment which is adequately muffled to prevent excessive noise\nand vibration; and through the use of screening for control of dust and/or\nnoise; (ii)\n\nDrainage and water\ncontrol--may be provided by the utilization of existing natural waterways and\nwater bodies and by the construction of additional channels, water impoundments\nor water control equipment. Plans for water control equipment, where utilized, shall be submitted by the applicant in conjunction with the written portion of\nthe mining plan. The alteration of stream beds or banks located within the\npermit area will be subject to the regulations of the department relative to\nthe use and protection of waters promulgated pursuant to sections\n15-1501\nand\n15-0505\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law. (iii)\n\nScreening--may consist of either artificial or natural barriers such as berms, fences, shrubs, trees or any combination of these which have the multiple\neffect of confining dust and flying particles to the mine, reducing noise\nlevels, and which minimize the visual impact of the mine on the people of the\n\nState.
