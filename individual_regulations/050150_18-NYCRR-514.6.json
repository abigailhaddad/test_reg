  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 514.6 - Posting of orders for care, services or supplies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In certain instances, as defined by Parts\n505 and 506 of this Title, a prescription or fiscal order is required before a\nprovider may furnish MA care, services or supplies (e.g., provision of\nlaboratory services, drugs or sickroom supplies requires the fiscal order of a\nqualified practitioner). With regard to care, services or supplies for which a\nprescription or fiscal order is required, the department may direct an ordering\nprovider to enter an authorization into EMEVS (\"posting\") for the ordered care. Services or supplies which are to be furnished by another provider if the\ndepartment determines that the ordering provider's claims or orders for MA\ncare, services or supplies satisfy one or more of the criteria set forth in\nsection\n514.4\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (b) Posting of the order in\nEMEVS by the ordering provider establishes a record that the care, services or\nsupplies have been ordered by a qualified provider. The posting process enables\nthe department to verify that the care, services or supplies have been properly\nordered before paying a provider who submits a claim for furnishing them. Posting also permits the provider who is requested to furnish ordered care, services or supplies to verify through inquiry to EMEVS that the care, services\nor supplies have been properly ordered before filling the order. The provider\nmanual addressing the particular care, services or supplies ordered sets forth\nin detail those service types or procedures requiring written orders. (c) If an ordering provider who is required\nto post fails to post properly in a significant number of its weekly MA\ntransactions, the department may withhold payment of claims submitted by the\nordering provider which are equivalent in dollar value to established MA\nreimbursement amounts for care, services or supplies rendered or furnished by\nthe ordering provider to an MA recipient on the same date of service within the\nweekly transaction period as care, services or supplies ordered for such\nrecipient with respect to which the ordering provider failed to post properly, pending an audit or review of claims submitted and the ordering provider's\nservice and claiming practices. If the department finds a significant number of\nunjustified failures by the provider to post orders, the department may treat\nsuch provider failures as an unacceptable practice under Part 515 of this\n\nTitle. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n514.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
