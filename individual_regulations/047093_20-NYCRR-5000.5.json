  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 5000.5 - Filing of offer in compromise\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Filing. An offer in compromise may only be made after the issuance to the\ntaxpayer of a written notice of the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance\nadvising the taxpayer of a tax deficiency, determination of tax due, assessment, or denial of a refund, credit or reimbursement application. The\ntaxpayer shall file an offer in compromise as prescribed in the\nforms. (b) Supporting documents. (1)\n\nAn offer in compromise based on doubt as\nto liability must be supported by appropriate documents and briefs, and the\namount acceptable will depend upon the degree of doubt found in the particular\ncase. (2)\n\nAn offer in compromise\nbased on doubt as to collectibility requires a showing that the taxpayer has\nbeen discharged in bankruptcy, is insolvent, or that collection in full would\ncause an individual taxpayer undue economic hardship. A statement of financial\ncondition and other information (Form DTF-5) is required in all\noffer-in-compromise cases based on the taxpayer's inability to pay the total\namount due or that full payment will cause undue economic hardship, regardless\nof the type of tax or amount of liability involved. The amount acceptable in\ncompromise must reasonably reflect collection potential (reasonable collection\npotential) or otherwise be justified by proof offered by the taxpayer. Reasonable collection potential is based on the total realizable value of the\ntaxpayer's assets and the amount that could reasonably be expected to be\ncollected from the taxpayer's anticipated future income, after giving effect to\nall priorities granted to New York State and applicable statutes of limitations\non collections. (i) The realizable value of\nthe taxpayer's assets is the amount that could reasonably be expected from the\nsale of the assets within 90 days or less (quick sale value) minus any amount\nowed to a secured creditor with priority over the department's interest. Assets\nsuch as real property, personal and business assets, and vehicles will\ngenerally be valued at 80 percent of fair market value to determine the quick\nsale value. (ii)\n\nGenerally, anticipated future income is calculated over the remainder of the collection\nperiod, but no less than a period of 5 years and no more than a period of 10\nyears, unless there are circumstances indicating that a significant recovery\ncan reasonably be expected if a longer period is used. Other circumstances, including the age of taxpayer, the age of the liability, and the best interests\nof the State are also considered. Collateral agreements, such as agreements\npertaining to payments from future income may also be required based on the\nfacts in a particular case. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n5000.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
