Materials that contain no post-consumer coatings or\nsecondary industrial coatings. (cg)\nVOC content. The weight of VOC per volume of coating, calculated\naccording to the procedures specified in section\n205.6\nof this Part. VOC content is\nVOC regulatory, as defined in subdivision (ch) of this section and calculated\naccording to the procedures specified in section\n205.6\n(b) of this\n\nPart, for all coatings except those in the low solids category. For coatings in\nthe low solids category, the VOC content is VOC (ls), as calculated in section\n205.6\n(b)(2)\nof\nthis Part. If the coating is a multi-component product, the VOC content is VOC\nregulatory as mixed or catalyzed. If the coating contains silanes, siloxanes, or other ingredients that generate ethanol or other VOCs during the curing\nprocess, the VOC content must include the VOCs emitted during curing. VOC\ncontent must include maximum amount of thinning solvent recommended by the\nmanufacturer. (ch)\nVOC\nregulatory. VOC regulatory is the weight of VOC per volume of coating, less the volume of water and exempt compounds. (ci)\n\nWaterproofing sealer. A coating labeled and formulated for application to a\nporous substrate for the primary purpose of preventing the penetration of\nwater. (1)\n\nFor products manufactured\non and after January 1, 2021, this coating category will be subject to the VOC\nlimit for concrete/masonry sealers. (cj)\n\nWaterproofing concrete/masonry\nsealer. A clear or pigmented film-forming coating that is labeled\nand formulated for sealing concrete and masonry to provide resistance against\nwater, alkalis, acids, ultraviolet light and staining. (1)\n\nFor products manufactured on and after\n\nJanuary 1, 2021, this coating category will be subject to the VOC limit for\nconcrete/masonry sealers. (ck)\n\nWaterproofing membrane.
