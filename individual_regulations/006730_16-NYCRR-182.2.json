  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 182.2 - Additions and retirements of electric plant\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose of avoiding undue\nrefinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of\nelectric plant, all property shall be considered as consisting of (1) units of\nproperty or retirement units and (2) minor items. Units of property means those\nitems of electric plant which are sufficiently distinct or important so that\nwhen they are retired with or without being replaced by other units of the same\ntype or use, they are accounted for by crediting the amount at which they are\ncarried on the books to the electric plant account in which included. All other\nitems are to be considered as minor items. These retirement units should not be\nconfused with continuing property record units filed by Class C utilities; the\nlatter are units for which the cost will be shown separately in the continuing\nproperty records. Whenever units of property are mentioned in this system of\naccounts, the term refers to retirement units and not to continuing property\nrecord units. Each utility may adopt its own list of units of property for the\npurpose of this instruction until such time as the commission shall prescribe a\nlist of units. (b) Units of\nproperty. (1)\n\nWhen a unit of property is added\nto electric plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the appropriate electric\nplant account. (2)\n\nWhen a unit of\nproperty is retired from electric plant (i.e., is removed, sold, abandoned, destroyed or otherwise ceases to be used or useful in electric service), whether or not replaced by another unit of the same type or use, the amount at\nwhich it is carried on the books shall be credited to the electric plant\naccount in which it is included (determined in the manner set forth in\nsubdivision [d] of this section) and charged to the depreciation reserve\nprovided for such property. (c) Minor items of property. (1)\n\nWhen a minor item of property which does\nnot replace a similar item is added to electric plant, the cost thereof shall\nbe charged to the appropriate maintenance account and no entry shall be made in\nthe electric plant or depreciation reserve accounts. (2)\n\nWhen a minor item is retired and replaced\nindependently of the unit of property of which it is a part, the cost of\nreplacement shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance account and no\nentry shall be made in the electric plant or depreciation reserve accounts. The\nremoval and replacement of poles shall be handled as additions and retirements\nof property and not as maintenance. (3)\n\nWhen a minor item the book cost of which\ndoes not exceed $50 is retired and not replaced, if the book cost of such minor\nitem is included with or spread over one or more units of property so that it\nwill be accounted for through the retirement of such one or more units of\nproperty, no separate credit to the electric plant account shall be made; otherwise, however, the book cost of such minor item shall be credited to the\nappropriate electric plant account and charged to account 1250, Reserve for\n\nDepreciation of Utility Plant. Note A:For example, if a pole is a unit and the cost of\nattachments, such as crossarms, guys, etc., is spread on an average basis over\nall the poles or is included as a part of the cost of the pole to which they\nare attached, no separate credit to the plant account shall be made when such\nan attachment (the book cost of which is less than $50) is retired, even though\nnot replaced. Any labor in connection with the removal shall be charged to the\nappropriate maintenance account, and any salvage for material recovered shall\nbe credited to the appropriate maintenance account. (d) Determination of amount to be\ncredited to plant accounts. Electric plant retired shall be credited to the\nplant accounts at the amount at which such property is included therein, including all components of construction costs, such as engineering, supervision, interest and taxes during construction, etc. The amount shall be\ndetermined from the utility's records and if this can not be done, it shall be\nestimated. When it is impracticable to determine the amount carried on the\nbooks for each item, due to the relatively large number or small cost thereof, the average of such items, with due allowances for any differences in size, character and year of installation (if known) shall be used. (e) Land retired. When land is retired the\namount at which it is carried on the books shall be credited to the appropriate\nland account. If the land is sold, the difference between the amount at which\nit is carried on the books and the sale price of the land (less commissions and\nother expenses of making the sale) shall be credited or debited to account\n1250, Reserve for Depreciation of Utility Plant.
