  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 52.8 - Evidence\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The rules of\nevidence governing proceedings in the courts of the State shall not be rigidly\nenforced in hearings and interviews before the Authority, and unless objection\nis made and duly noted in the stenographic record, all evidence appearing in\nthe stenographic record shall be deemed to have been validly introduced for the\nconsideration of the Authority. (b) The introduction of cumulative evidence shall be avoided and the commissioner\nmay limit the testimony of any witness which he judges to be merely cumulative; however, the party offering such testimony may make a short avowal of the\ntestimony which would be given and if the witness asserts that such avowal is\ntrue, this avowal shall be made a part of the stenographic record. (c) Upon due application to the commissioner\nin charge prior to the determination of the Authority, the hearing may, in the\ndiscretion of the commissioner, be reopened for the presentation of new\nevidence. Such application must set forth concisely the nature of the new\nevidence. The Authority may, on its own motion, reopen a hearing or interview\nfor the presentation of new evidence. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n52.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
