  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 370.3 - Emergency and short-term cases\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. Social services districts must\nauthorize safety net assistance to provide for the effective and prompt relief\nof identified needs which cannot be provided for under Emergency Assistance to\n\nNeedy Families with Children (EAF) or Family Assistance (FA), including\npresumptive eligibility for FA. Emergency and short-term assistance is limited\nto the items, conditions and amounts specified in Part 352 of this Subchapter. The district must provide necessary supervision to such cases in order to\nmodify or terminate grants as quickly as circumstances require. An emergency or\nshort-term case is a case in which need is presumed to continue for a period of\nless than three months; provided, however, that cases in which frequent\nreapplications for assistance are made are not considered emergency or\nshort-term. (b) Eligibility for\nemergency safety net assistance. Social services districts must authorize\nemergency safety net assistance only under the following conditions: (1)\nthere is an identified emergency need. An\nemergency is a serious occurrence or situation needing prompt action; (2)\nthe individual or household is without\nincome or resources immediately available to meet the emergency need and the\nindividual's or household's gross income at the time of application does not\nexceed 125 percent of the current Federal income official poverty line, as\ndefined and annually revised by the United States Department of Health and\n\nHuman Services under the authority of\n42\nU.S.C. 9902(2). For purposes\nof determining eligibility for assistance pursuant to this section, these\nannually revised poverty lines are effective April 1st through March 31st of\neach State fiscal year. If the emergency is the result of a fire, flood or\nother like catastrophe or if the emergency assistance is granted in accordance\nwith section\n352.5\n(c)-(e)\nof\nthis Title, the individual's or household's gross income at the time of\napplication can exceed 125 percent of the Federal income official poverty\nguideline; (3)\nthe emergency need\ncannot be met under the emergency assistance to needy families with children, the Home Energy Assistance Program, FA or safety net assistance\nprograms; (4)\nthe applicant is not\ndisqualified from receiving recurring assistance or subject to a durational\nsanction, or the emergency did not arise because the applicant had previously\nbeen disqualified or sanctioned for failure to comply with the nonfinancial\nrequirements of this Title; and\n(5)\nin an application for an allowance to pay shelter arrears where the applicant\nreasonably demonstrates an ability to pay shelter expenses, including any\namounts in excess of the appropriate local agency maximum monthly shelter\nallowance in the future. In determining an applicant's ability to pay shelter\nexpenses, a social services district must consider the applicant's ability to\nmake payments under any repayment agreements entered into in accordance with\nthis paragraph. However, when in the judgment of the local social services\nofficial, the individual or household has sufficient income or resources to\nsecure and maintain alternate permanent housing, shelter arrears need not be\npaid to maintain a specific housing accommodation. To receive assistance to pay\nshelter arrears, the applicant must sign an agreement to repay the assistance\nin a period not to exceed 12 months from receipt of such assistance. The\nrepayment agreement must set forth a schedule of payments that will assure\nrepayment within the 12-month period, and must specify the frequency of the\npayments, the due date of the first payment, the address to where payments must\nbe made and the consequences of failing to repay the assistance as agreed. Subsequent assistance to pay arrears may not be granted unless there are no\npast-due amounts owed under any such repayment agreement. The social services\ndistrict, in addition to any rights it has pursuant to the Social Services Law, may enforce the repayment agreement in any manner available to a\ncreditor. (c) Emergency\nsafety net assistance must not be used to meet needs during a period of\nineligibility for public assistance due to the receipt of a lump sum. (d) Determination. When emergency need is met\nprior to the completion of investigation, the evidence on which the presumption\nof eligibility and need is based must be documented in the case\nrecord. (e) Authorization. Where\nthe need for safety net assistance is short-term or where emergency needs are\nmet prior to the completion of an investigation, assistance must be authorized\non a one-time basis or for the period during which the need is expected to\ncontinue. In cases where the need is deemed to be emergency or short-term, the\ngrant may be limited to those items for which there is immediate need. The\nmonths in which any individual receives recurring emergency safety net\nassistance, must count against the two-year (24-month) cumulative total of\nsafety net cash assistance in accordance with section\n370.4\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Title. Recurring emergency safety net assistance is assistance authorized\nfor a time period to meet the continuing needs of the applicant rather than\nassistance authorized on a one-time basis. (f) Mass emergency assistance. When emergency\nneeds occur on a mass basis, such as the need for mass feeding or clothing\ndistribution and other essential items, these needs must be considered as\nemergency and short-term and provided for in accordance with subdivision (a) of\nthis section. Names of persons requesting such assistance must be recorded on\nform DSS-880, Register of Application and Authorization for Emergency\n\nAssistance. This form constitutes their application. The DSS-880, when signed\nby the social services official, serves as the authorization of such\nassistance. (g) Town social service\nofficer. When application is made to a town social service officer, he or she\nmay make an emergency grant of safety net assistance and immediately forward\nthe application to the county department of social services for investigation. Such investigation must be completed as promptly as possible, at least within\n30 days. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
