  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 361-2.4 - Permit application requirements for land application facilities\n\nState Regulations\nA land application facility that is not an exempt\nfacility or subject to the registration provisions of section\n361-2.3\nof this Subpart must obtain\na permit and must submit an application, which includes the requirements\nidentified in this section and section\n360.16\nof this Title. The\napplication must include: (a) A soil\nsurvey map from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Soil Conservation Service, with a key to the soil survey, indicating the location of land application. Location-specific soil investigation results must be provided, if deemed\nnecessary by the department, based on soil and hydrogeologic conditions at the\nsite. (b) Information concerning\nthe depth to bedrock and groundwater, and the source of the data. (c) A land application operation plan that\nincludes: (1)\nthe amount of land that will be\nused and the crops to be grown; (2)\ntiming of planting and harvesting; (3)\napplication rate and any supplemental\nwaste or fertilizer that will be used (including manure); (4)\ndescription of field stockpile storage, if applicable; (5)\nprovisions for\nwaste storage or disposal when land application is restricted (e.g., due to\nweather or other site conditions); and\n(6)\na description of how the design and\noperating requirements in section\n360.19\nof this Title and section\n361-2.5\nof this Subpart will be\nsatisfied. (d) Written\npermission from the landowner is required for use of the land for land\napplication, unless the landowner is the applicant. (e) Calculations showing the proposed daily\nand annual hydraulic loading, in gallons per acre. (f) Biosolids land application. In addition\nto the requirements outlined in subdivisions\n361-2.4\n(a) through\n(d) of this section, an application for a\npermit for a land application facility involving biosolids must contain the\nfollowing information: (1)\nA description of\nthe biosolids including: (i) a description of\neach source including the name of the wastewater treatment plant, annual\nbiosolids production, the amount of biosolids to be land applied and a\ndescription of the federal or state pretreatment program, where applicable. Wastewater and partially treated biosolids that are generated at one treatment\nplant and are treated at another wastewater treatment facility before land\napplication are not considered separate sources; (ii)\na description of the quality of the\nbiosolids, including analytical results, as identified below: (a) the required parameters for analysis are\nfound in Table 1 in section\n361-3.9\nof this Part; (b) the minimum number of analyses, for each\nbiosolids source is outlined in Table 2 in section\n361-3.9\nof this Part; (c) for each analysis, the sampling date, location, and protocol used to obtain representative samples must be\nprovided; (d) a minimum of six\nmonths of biosolids production must be represented by the analytical results\nsubmitted. With the exception of pH and total solids, all results must be\nreported on a dry weight basis; (e) analyses for other pollutants can be\nrequired by the department, on a case-specific basis, based on information from\nthe pretreatment program and other sources; (f) all analyses must be performed by a\nlaboratory certified by the Department of Health for that type of analysis, using methods acceptable to the department, unless use of an alternate\nlaboratory or method is authorized by the department. Copies of the original\nlaboratory results must be included with the permit application; (g) the analysis requirement can be satisfied\nin part or in whole by recent samples analyzed for and reported to the\ndepartment; (h) analyses performed\nmore than one year before the date the permit application is submitted are not\nacceptable; (i) all samples must be\nrepresentative of the biosolids to be land applied; and\n(j) a table summarizing the analytical\nresults must be provided, including the mean and range of the results\nfound. (2)\nA\ndetailed description of the processes to reduce pathogenic organism content and\nto reduce vector attraction including: (i) the\nmethods that will be used for pathogen reduction and vector attraction\nreduction; (ii)\nthe monitoring and\ndata gathering procedures that will be undertaken to demonstrate compliance\nincluding type, location, and frequency; and\n(iii)\nfor existing systems, recent operating\ndata and/or analytical data that demonstrate that the system can meet the\npathogen and vector attraction reduction criteria. (3)\n\nCalculations showing the proposed\nnutrient loading rates, including nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. The\nloading rate calculations must be based on the biosolids analyses, impacts of\nprevious waste applications, addition of supplemental nutrients, and the\nnutrient requirements of the crops grown. (i) The following formulas must be used to calculate plant-available nitrogen, unless the use of an alternative formula is approved by the department: NI = percent inorganic nitrogen = percent ammonia +\npercent nitrate\nNO = percent organic nitrogen = percent total Kjeldahl\nnitrogen - percent ammonia\nNH3 = percent ammonia\nNO3 = percent nitrate\nN = nitrogen\nA = value based on treatment method employed\nA values: A = 2 for composted biosolids\nA = 4 for anaerobically digested biosolids\nA = 6 for aerobically digested, lime stabilized and air\ndried biosolids\n\nFor waste incorporated into the soil: Pounds available N per dry ton biosolids = (NI x 20) +\n(NO x A)\n\nFor waste surface applied: Pounds available N per dry ton biosolids = (NH3 x 10) +\n(NO3 x 20) + (NO x A)\n(ii)\n\nIf the soil has received biosolids in the past two years, the residual nitrogen\nin the soil must be included in the nutrient loading calculation. The residual\nnitrogen must be subtracted from the nitrogen needs of the crop grown before\ndetermining the appropriate application rate. The following values must be used\nto determine the release rate of residual nitrogen: Release of Residual Nitrogen during Biosolids\n\nDecomposition in Soil\n\nYears since last biosolids application\nAR Values\nA=2\nA=4\nA=6\n1\n0.90\n1.60\n2.10\n2\n0.51\n0.72\n0.95\nAR = Residual Nitrogen Factor\n\nResidual Available N (pounds N per acre) = Original\n\nApplication Rate (dry ton per acre) x Original NO (percent) x AR\n(iii)\n\nThe value(s) used for the\nnutrient needs of the crop(s) grown must be based on the results of a soil test\nand resulting nutrient recommendation, or equivalent justification for the\nvalue chosen. Copies of the nutrient recommendations must be\nsubmitted. (iv)\n\nFor phosphorus, 30\npercent of the phosphorus applied with the biosolids must be assumed to be\navailable for plant use. For potassium, 100 percent of the potassium applied\nwith the biosolids must be assumed to be available for plant use. (4)\n\nInformation concerning the\nsoil pH of the plow layer including the source of this information, and method\nfor adjusting soil pH, if required. (5)\n\nSoil quality data including analyses for\npH, arsenic, cadmium, chromium (total), copper, lead, mercury, molybdenum, nickel, selenium, and zinc. (i) A minimum of\none analysis is required for every 50 acres, or fraction thereof. (ii)\n\nEach soil sample must be a composite of\na minimum of ten randomly selected sample locations.
