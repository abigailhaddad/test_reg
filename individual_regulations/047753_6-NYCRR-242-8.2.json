(2)\n\nRequirements for recertification. (i) Whenever the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or change in\na certified continuous emissions monitoring system under section\n242-8.1\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart that the administrator or the department determines significantly\naffects the ability of the system to accurately measure or record\nCO\n2\nmass emissions or heat input or to meet the\nquality-assurance and quality-control requirements of\n40 CFR\n75.21\nor appendix B to 40 CFR part\n75\n(see\ntable 1, section 200.9 of this Title), the owner or operator shall recertify\nthe monitoring system according to\n40 CFR\n75.20(b)\n(see table 1, section 200.9 of this Title). (ii)\n\nFor systems using stack measurements such as stack flow, stack moisture\ncontent, CO\n2\nor O\n2\nmonitors, whenever the owner or operator makes a replacement, modification, or change to\nthe flue gas handling system or the unit's operation that the administrator or\nthe department determines to significantly change the flow or concentration\nprofile, the owner or operator shall recertify the continuous emissions\nmonitoring system according to\n40 CFR\n75.20(b)\n(see table 1, section 200.9 of this Title). Examples of changes which require recertification\ninclude: replacement of the analyzer, change in location or orientation of the\nsampling probe or site, or changing of flow rate monitor polynomial\ncoefficients. (3)\n\nApproval process for initial certifications and recertification. Subparagraphs\n(3)(i) through (iv) of this subdivision apply to both initial certification and\nrecertification of a monitoring system under section\n242-8.1\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart. For recertifications, replace the words \"certification\" and\n\"initial certification\" with the word \"recertification,\" replace the word\n\"certified\" with \"recertified,\" and proceed in the manner prescribed in\n40 CFR\n75.20(b)(5) and (g)(7)\n(see\ntable 1, section 200.9 of this Title) in lieu of this section. (i) Notification of certification. The\nCO\n2\nauthorized account representative shall submit to\nthe department or its agent, the appropriate EPA regional office and the\nadministrator a written notice of the dates of certification in accordance with\nsection\n242-8.4\nof this Subpart. (ii)\n\nCertification application. The\nCO\n2\nauthorized account representative shall submit to\nthe department or its agent a certification application for each monitoring\nsystem. A complete certification application shall include the information\nspecified in\n40 CFR\n75.63\n(see table 1, section 200.9 of this\n\nTitle). (iii)\n\nProvisional\ncertification data. The provisional certification date for a monitor shall be\ndetermined in accordance with\n40 CFR\n75.20(a)(3)\n(see table 1, section 200.9 of this Title). A provisionally certified monitor may be used\nunder the CO\n2\n\nBudget Trading Program for a period not to\nexceed 120 days after receipt by the department of the complete certification\napplication for the monitoring system or component thereof under subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph. Data measured and recorded by the provisionally\ncertified monitoring system or component thereof, in accordance with the\nrequirements of 40 CFR part\n75\n(see table 1, section 200.9 of this Title), will\nbe considered valid quality-assured data (retroactive to the date and time of\nprovisional certification), provided that the department does not invalidate\nthe provisional certification by issuing a notice of disapproval within 120\ndays of receipt of the complete certification application by the\ndepartment. (iv)\n\nCertification\napplication approval process. The department will issue a written notice of\napproval or disapproval of the certification application to the owner or\noperator within 120 days of receipt of the complete certification application\nunder subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. In the event the department does not\nissue such a notice within such 120-day period, each monitoring system which\nmeets the applicable performance requirements of 40 CFR part\n75\n(see table 1, section 200.9 of this Title) and is included in the certification application\nwill be deemed certified for use under the CO\n2\n\nBudget\n\nTrading Program. (a) Approval notice. If the\ncertification application is complete and shows that each monitoring system\nmeets the applicable performance requirements of 40 CFR part\n75\n(see table 1, section 200.9 of this Title), then the department will issue a written notice\nof approval of the certification application within 120 days of\nreceipt. (b) Incomplete application\nnotice. If the certification application is not complete, then the department\nwill issue a written notice of incompleteness that sets a reasonable date by\nwhich the CO\n2\nauthorized account representative must\nsubmit the additional information required to complete the certification\napplication. If the CO\n2\nauthorized account\nrepresentative does not comply with the notice of incompleteness by the\nspecified date, then the department may issue a notice of disapproval under\nclause (\nc\n) of this subparagraph. The 120 day review period\nshall not begin before receipt of a complete certification\napplication. (c) Disapproval\nnotice. If the certification application shows that any monitoring system or\ncomponent thereof does not meet the performance requirements of 40 CFR part\n75\n(see table 1, section 200.9 of this Title), or if the certification application\nis incomplete and the requirement for disapproval under clause\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph is met, then the department will\nissue a written notice of disapproval of the certification application. Upon\nissuance of such notice of disapproval, the provisional certification is\ninvalidated by the department and the data measured and recorded by each\nuncertified monitoring system or component thereof shall not be considered\nvalid quality assured data beginning with the date and hour of provisional\ncertification. The owner or operator shall follow the procedures for loss of\ncertification in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph for each monitoring system\nor component thereof, which is disapproved for initial certification. (d) Audit decertification. The department may\nissue a notice of disapproval of the certification status of a monitor in\naccordance with section\n242-8.3\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (v) Procedures\nfor loss of certification. If the department issues a notice of disapproval of\na certification application under clause (iv)(\nc\n) of this\nparagraph or a notice of disapproval of certification status under clause\n(iv)(\nd\n) of this paragraph, then: (a) the owner or operator shall substitute\nthe following values for each disapproved monitoring system, for each hour of\nunit operation during the period of invalid data beginning with the date and\nhour of provisional certification and continuing until the time, date, and hour\nspecified under\n40 CFR\n75.20(a)(5)(i)\nor\n40 CFR\n75.20(g)(7)\n(see table 1, section 200.9 of this Title): (1)\nfor units\nusing or intending to monitor for CO\n2\nmass emissions\nusing heat input or for units using the low mass emissions excepted methodology\nunder\n40\nCFR\n75.19\n(see table 1, section 200.9 of this\n\nTitle), the maximum potential hourly heat input of the unit; or\n(2)\nfor units intending to monitor for\nCO\n2\nmass emissions using a CO\n2\npollutant concentration monitor and a flow monitor, the maximum potential\nconcentration of CO\n2\nand the maximum potential flow rate\nof the unit under section\n2.1\nof appendix A of 40 CFR part\n75\n(see table 1, section 200.9 of this Title); (b) the CO\n2\nauthorized\naccount representative shall submit a notification of certification retest\ndates and a new certification application in accordance with subparagraphs (i)\nand (ii) of this paragraph; and\n(c) the owner or operator shall repeat all certification tests or other\nrequirements that were failed by the monitoring system, as indicated in the\ndepartment's notice of disapproval, no later than 30 unit operating days after\nthe date of issuance of the notice of disapproval. (e) Initial certification and\nrecertification procedures for low mass emissions units using the excepted\nmethodologies under section\n242-8.1\n(c)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart.
