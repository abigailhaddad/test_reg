  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 943.7 - Grassroots Lobbying\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Principles. (1)\n\nWhile Direct Lobbying attempts to\ninfluence a Public Official through a Direct Contact by the Lobbyist, Grassroots Lobbying attempts to influence a Public Official indirectly, or\nthrough another. (2)\nA Grassroots\n\nLobbyist is a person or organization who solicits another to deliver a message\nto a Public Official; the audience or recipients of grassroots communications\nwho voluntarily (and without compensation) subsequently deliver the message to\nthe Public Official are not Grassroots Lobbyists. (3)\n\nEvery Grassroots Lobbying Communication\nis attributable to a Lobbyist, which may be the organization as a\nwhole. (4)\n\nGrassroots Lobbying does\nnot require the identification of an Individual Lobbyist(s) on lobbying reports\nunless the individual engaged in Grassroots Lobbying is a Retained Lobbyist, as\nset forth in subdivision (e) of this section, or is retained or compensated\nspecifically for their social media activities, as set forth in subdivision\n(f)(2)(ii) of this section. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nGrassroots Lobbying\nmeans an attempt to indirectly influence an action enumerated in section\n1-c(c)(i)-(x) of the Lobbying Act through a Grassroots Lobbying Communication, which may be communicated via various forms, including, but not limited to, those listed in subsection\n943.7\n(g). (2)\n\nGrassroots Lobbying\n\nCommunication\nmeans a communication that: (i) References or otherwise implicates an\naction enumerated in section 1-c(c)(i)-(x) of the Lobbying Act; (ii)\n\nTakes a clear position on that action; and\n(iii)\n\nIncludes a Call to\n\nAction. (3)\n\nCall\nto Action\nmeans: (i) A solicitation, exhortation, or encouragement to the public, a segment of the public, or an\nindividual to: (1)\ndirectly contact a Public\n\nOfficial; or\n(2)\nsolicit, exhort, or\nencourage others to directly contact a Public Official. To qualify as a Call to\n\nAction, the communication need not specify the form the contact must\ntake; (ii)\n\nThe inclusion\nof an address, email address, website address, phone number or similar contact\ninformation for a Public Official even if the communication does not\nspecifically exhort the public to contact the Public Official; or\n(iii)\n\nThe inclusion of a paper or electronic\npetition, text message, social media communication, or similar material (or\nelectronic link to such petition or material) for the recipient to use to\ncommunicate with a Public Official even if the communication does not\nspecifically exhort the public to use such material. (c) Grassroots Lobbying and the\n\nIndividual\n(1)\nA person who publishes a\n\nGrassroots Lobbying Communication is engaged in Grassroots Lobbying on their\nown behalf and acting as their own Designated Lobbyist. (i) For example, a person who buys billboard\nspace that includes a Grassroots Lobbying Communication is engaging in\n\nGrassroots Lobbying on their own behalf. (2)\nA person who engages in Grassroots\n\nLobbying on their own behalf acting as their own Designated Lobbyist is the\n\nPrincipal Lobbyist but is not required to list themselves as an Individual\n\nLobbyist unless such person also engages in Direct Lobbying. (d) Grassroots Lobbying and the\n\nLobbying Organization\n(1)\n\nAn organization\nengages in Grassroots Lobbying on its own behalf when a Grassroots Lobbying\n\nCommunication is issued by the organization, including when an employee or\n\nDesignated Lobbyist of the organization delivers a Grassroots Lobbying\n\nCommunication at the direction of the organization. For example, an organization that includes a Grassroots\n\nLobbying Communication on its website is engaging in Grassroots Lobbying on its\nown behalf. An organization that issues a press release on its own\nletterhead that includes a Grassroots Lobbying Communication is engaging in\n\nGrassroots Lobbying on its own behalf. (2)\n\nEmployed and Designated Lobbyists are not\nrequired to be listed as Individual Lobbyists by organizations based on\n\nGrassroots Lobbying. (3)\n\nExpenses\nincurred by an organization acting as its own Grassroots Lobbyist shall be\nattributable to such organization. (e) Grassroots Lobbying and the Retained\n\nLobbyist. (1)\nA Retained Lobbyist's activities\non behalf of a Client constitute Grassroots Lobbying and an Individual Lobbyist\nmust be listed on lobbying reports if the Retained Lobbyist delivers a\n\nGrassroots Lobbying Communication and can be identified as speaking for, representing, or endorsing the position of the Client. (i) A person is not required to be identified\nas an Individual Lobbyist solely by being included as a contact person on a\n\nClient's Grassroots Lobbying Communication on Client letterhead. (ii)\n\nFor example, the owner of a billboard is\nnot speaking for, representing, or endorsing the position taken by the Client\nthat has rented space on the billboard. However, an individual who is paid to\nspeak on behalf of a Client and delivers a Grassroots Lobbying Communication\nshould be identified as an Individual Lobbyist. (f) Grassroots Lobbying through Social Media. (1)\nA Social Media communication constitutes\na Grassroots Lobbying Communication when it satisfies the criteria set forth in\nsubpart 943.7(b)(2). (2)\n\nAttribution of Social Media activities and expenses to Principal Lobbyists. (i) When Grassroots Lobbying through a Social\n\nMedia communication is undertaken by an organization, through the\norganization's Social Media account(s), this activity is reportable\n\nLobbying Activity by the organization. (a) No\n\nIndividual Lobbyists are required to be listed on lobbying filings based on\nthis activity alone. (ii)\n\nWhen Grassroots Lobbying through a Social Media communication is undertaken by\nan individual, through their personal social media account(s), this activity is\nnot\nreportable Lobbying Activity\nunless such individual is specifically retained by a Client for such Social\n\nMedia activity. (a) In this case, the\nindividual should register as a Lobbyist on behalf of the paying Client, listing themselves as an Individual Lobbyist. (b) Any expenses incurred to create, promote, place or otherwise highlight an individual's\npersonal\n\nSocial\n\nMedia activity that are reportable pursuant to subparagraph (ii) above, are\nreportable by the party incurring the expenses. (iii)\n\nReportable expenses attributable to an\norganization's or individual's Grassroots Lobbying via Social Media may\ninclude, but are not limited to: consulting services, sponsoring posts, staff\ntime allocated to planning and posting, search engine optimization and\nsponsoring, and advertising. (iv)\nA\nreasonable methodology used in good faith to calculate lobbying expenses\nrelated to Grassroots Lobbying via Social Media is acceptable. (g) General Grassroots\n\nLobbying Examples. (1)\n\nAny of the following\ncould involve Grassroots Lobbying, as defined herein, if the required elements of a Grassroots Lobbying\n\nCommunication are otherwise present: (i) Rallies; (ii)\n\nBillboards; (iii)\n\nPrint media advertisements; (iv)\n\nWebsites; (v) Social Media communications; (vi)\n\nTelevision and radio\ncommercials; (vii)\n\nLetter writing\ncampaigns; or\n(viii)\n\nPersonal\nrequests by a Lobbyist for another person to contact a Public Official. (2)\n\nThe following\nfunctions or roles, standing alone, would not constitute Grassroots Lobbying: (i) Owners of billboards or signs; (ii)\n\nCopy editing; (iii)\n\nAdvertisement writers; (iv)\n\nStoryboard artists; (v) Film crews; (vi)\n\nPhotographers; (vii)\n\nVideo editors; (viii)\n\nWebsite managers, hosts, or internet\nservice providers; (ix)\n\nMedia\noutlets or broadcasters; (x) Media\nbuyers or placement agents; (xi)\n\nDelivery services; or\n(xii)\n\nSecretaries, clerical, and ministerial staff.
