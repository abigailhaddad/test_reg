After the offering plan is\nfiled, the plan must be amended periodically as required by section\n23.5\nof this Part. (i) Statutory\ncompliance. Unless expressly provided herein, nothing contained in this Part shall be\nconstrued as limiting the requirements set forth in article 23-A of the G.B.L. and in article 9B of the Real Property Law (the New York Condominium\n\nAct) or the laws regulating condominiums in the state where the property is located.

(k) Exemptions. Upon written application of the sponsor or sponsor's attorney, the\n\nDepartment of Law, in its discretion, may exempt a plan from the application of any provision of this Part, where it is found that enforcement of the\nprovision is not necessary to effectuate the purposes of the G.B.L. or to protect the investing public. The application shall: (1)\nbe annexed to and be submitted with the attorney's transmittal letter; (2)\nset forth the provisions from which the exemption is sought and the grounds for the exemption; and\n(3)\nbe signed by sponsor or the sponsor's attorney.
