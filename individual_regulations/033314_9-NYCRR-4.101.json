  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.101 - Executive order no. 101: establishing the governor's office for voluntary service\n\nState Regulations\n\nOver the past half century our State has developed a strong\nworking partnership with a diverse group of voluntary organizations that have\nbecome part of the State' s heritage and tradition of providing for the less\nfortunate. The wellspring of this tradition always has been, and continues to\nbe, the idealism, compassion and generosity of the citizens of New York. An enduring partnership between the public, private, and\nvoluntary sectors, on behalf of the State and its communities, can ensure that\nthe government is responsive to real needs and draws on the best resources of\nthe community. Moreover, coordination of these efforts with governmental\nprograms can leverage essential additional financial assistance for those in\nneed in these times of fiscal constraint. It is, therefore, important that the\nrelationship between the State and the voluntary sector be promoted and\nencouraged. NOW, THEREFORE, I, MARIO M. CUOMO, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: I. The Governor's Office for Voluntary\n\nService\n\nThere is hereby created within the Executive Chamber the\n\nGovernor' s Office for Voluntary Service (\"the office\").

III. Procedures of the Office\n\nThe office shall establish procedures to govern the method\nand manner of its operations and the submission of matters for its\nconsideration. The office may employ such staff as may be deemed necessary\nby the director at compensation to be fixed by the director subject to the\napproval of the Governor and the Budget Director. In carrying out its\nfunctions, powers and duties, the office shall, wherever possible, make use of\nthe staff resources of the Executive Chamber and of State agencies, as well as\nthose of the private sector. All departments, divisions, boards, offices, and public\ncorporations of the State are directed to cooperate with the office and to\nprovide such assistance as the office may request to fulfill its purposes. Such\nassistance may include, but need not be limited to, the provision of\nstatistical and policy data in such form as is determined by the office and\nconsultation with such agency staff as the office identifies. IV. Advisory Board\n\nThere is hereby created an Advisory Board to the Office of\n\nVoluntary Service (\"the board\").
