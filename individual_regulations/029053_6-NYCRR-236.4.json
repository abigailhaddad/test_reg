Tit. 6 § 236.4 - Repair requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any owner\nor operator of a synthetic organic chemical manufacturing facility shall repair\nleaking components in accordance with this section. (b) Once a leaking component is identified, any owner or operator subject to this Part must: (1)\naffix a weatherproof and readily visible\ntag to the leaking component bearing an identification number and the date the\nleak was detected. This tag must not be removed until the component is repaired\nand passes reinspection; (2)\nmake\nan initial attempt to repair the leaking component within five days; (3)\nrepair the leaking component as soon as\npracticable, but not later than 15 calendar days after the leak is detected; and\n(4)\nremonitor all leaking\ncomponents within 48 hours after repairs have been completed. (c) Delay of repair of components\nas described in subdivision (b) of this section will be allowed by the\ndepartment provided that an initial attempt to repair is made after which a\ndecision is made by a duly authorized representative of the facility that\nreplacement parts necessary to complete the repair are not available in time, or that repair of the leaking component is technically infeasible without a\nprocess unit shutdown. Repair of such a component must be completed during the\nnext process unit shutdown and before subsequent start-up. (d) The department may require the\nrescheduling of a planned process unit shutdown to an earlier date based on the\nnumber and severity of tagged leaks awaiting repair at shutdown. Before\nrequiring a rescheduled shutdown, the department shall consider the effect of\nthe shutdown on production, the availability of needed repair equipment, and\nthe time required for contracting outside labor and/or rescheduling facility\npersonnel and shall so direct the source owner in writing to comply with the\nrescheduled shutdown. The source owner shall comply with the department's\ndirective, or shall request that a directed rescheduling of a planned process\nunit shutdown be reconsidered according to the following procedure: (1)\nA request for reconsideration must be\nfiled in writing with the department within 20 days of the receipt of the\ndepartment's directed rescheduling, and must be signed by a duly authorized\nrepresentative of the facility. (2)\n\nSuch request must include a statement supporting the source owner's claims of\nmisapplication of laws or regulations in the department's directive, and a\nstatement specifying the relief sought by the source owner.
