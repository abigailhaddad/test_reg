  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 154.0 - Statement of policy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Sections\n202\nand\n204\nof the\n\nState Finance Law authorize the reimbursement of basic moving expenses incurred\nby certain State employees and new appointees to a department or agency of the\n\nState in transporting themselves and their families and household effects to\ntheir new places of residence. (b) In the case of new appointees, it is the policy of the State that such\nreimbursement may be approved when the Department of Civil Service (for\ncompetitive class appointments) or the appointing authority (for appointments\noutside the competitive class) determine that there exists in New York State a\nshortage of qualified candidates for the position to which the appointment\nwould be made and when providing such reimbursement would improve the State's\nability to consummate an appointment. (c) For the purpose of reimbursement for\nmoving expenses, these regulations shall apply to: (1)\nofficers and employees whose positions\nare designated managerial or confidential pursuant to article 14 of the Civil\n\nService Law; (2)\nofficers of the\n\nDivision of Military and Naval Affairs in the Executive Department; (3)\nofficers and employees excluded from\nrepresentation rights under article 14 of the Civil Service Law, pursuant to\nrules and regulations of the Public Employment Relations Board; and\n(4)\nofficers or employees whose salaries are\nprescribed by section\n19\nof the\n\nCorrection Law. (d) Persons employed by political subdivisions of the State or by public\nauthorities are not to be considered as State employees for purposes of\nreimbursement, regardless of the fact that a portion of their compensation may\nbe paid from State funds. (e) It is\nnot the policy of the State to reimburse either employees or appointees covered\nby this Part for related expenses in relocation, such as selling and buying a\nhouse or renting temporary living quarters. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n154.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
