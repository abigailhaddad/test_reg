  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 78.7 - Assumed names\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Whenever a dealer files a certificate of doing business under an assumed name\nwith the county clerk, the dealer shall also file a copy of the certificate\nwith the commissioner. Thereafter, the dealer may do business in either his\nreal name or his assumed name. A dealer may have any number of assumed names\nwithout needing additional dealer registrations if every assumed name begins\nwith the same word or name. However, if the assumed names begin with different\nwords or names, then a separate dealer registration is required for each name. Example:John B. Smith Motor Cars, Inc., may have the\nassumed names John B. Smith Ford, John Boy Chevrolet and John and Jill Toyota\nunder a single-dealer registration. The assumed names Johnny's Dodge, Honest\n\nJohn Buick and JBS Volkswagen would require three-dealer registrations. (b) When a dealer sells a vehicle\nfor which the proof of ownership is in an assumed name, the certificate of sale\n(form MV-50) shall be written in the dealer's actual name d/b/a the assumed\nname. Example:Triple Q Ford, Inc., a registered dealer is\npermitted to do business under the assumed name Triple Q Jaguar. When the\ndealer receives a Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin from Jaguar\n\nManufacturing Corporation, it is made out to Triple Q Jaguar. When the car is\nsold, the name of the dealer must appear on the MV-50 as Triple Q Ford, Inc. d/b/a Triple Q Jaguar. (c) A dealer will be responsible for all transactions conducted by it, whether in\nreal name or assumed name. Any suspension or revocation action, or imposition\nof a civil penalty, will apply to all dealer registrations at one\nlocation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n78.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
