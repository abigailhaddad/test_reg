  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 6, ch. X, subch. A, art. 3, pt. 750 - STATE POLLUTANT DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM (SPDES) PERMITS\nState Regulations\n\nSubpart 750-1 - OBTAINING A SPDES PERMIT AND POSS REGISTRATION (§ 750-1.1 to 750-1.26)\n\nSubpart 750-2 - OPERATING IN ACCORDANCE WITH A SPDES PERMIT AND POSS REGISTRATION (§ 750-2.1 to 750-2.11)\n(a) This\nsection applies to any and all disposal systems permanently removed from use or\noperation at SPDES permitted facilities or at facilities for which a SPDES\npermit has been revoked or an application for renewal denied, unless a judicial\nor administrative stay is in effect. The intent of this section is to protect\npublic safety and health and to assure that no contamination of ground or\nsurface water will occur as a result of removing such systems from service\neither through the act of closure or through continuing the discharge of\npollutants into or through equipment; or through leaking, leaching, or\ndischarge of pollutants from wastewater or residuals remaining in disposal\nsystems which has been removed from use but remains on site. (b) The closure of a disposal system means\neither the termination of the source of wastewater or storm water, or the\npermitted conveyance of wastewater or storm water to an alternate location\n(such as a regional facility) in such a manner that no further treatment\nstorage or conveyance of wastewater or storm water is performed by the\nsystem. (c) Disposal system\nclosures shall conform with the following procedures: (1)\n\nOn or before 60 calendar days prior to\ntaking the system out of service a permittee shall: (i) submit to the regional water engineer the\nfollowing information concerning closure activities: (a) the date the system will cease\noperation; (b) the date the\ninfluent and effluent pipes will be sealed; (c) plans (signed and sealed by a New York\n\nState licensed professional engineer) for final disposition of the physical\nfacilities, including all treatment units, outfall line, and all mechanical and\nelectrical equipment and piping; (d) plans (signed and sealed by a New York\n\nState licensed professional engineer) for elimination of all equipment and/or\nconditions that could possibly pose a safety hazard, either during or after\nshut-down of operations; (e) verification that there are no lines in the collection system which are cross\nconnected (receiving both sanitary and storm water) or which do not contain\nadequate conveyance capacity; (f) the name of the licensed individual responsible for the maintenance and\noperation of the wastewater pumping station and/or disposal system systems that\nare still to be maintained; and\n(ii)\nnotify the regional water engineer, in\nwriting, concerning any deactivated lagoons or other actual or potential\ndischarges to ground water which may exist at the site. (2)\n\nProper management and/or removal of all\nresidual materials (collected grit and screenings, scums, sand bed material, and dried or liquid sludges), as well as filter media, and all other solids\nfrom the treatment process that may remain in the abandoned treatment works is\nrequired. (i) The permittee shall submit to\nthe regional water engineer proof of ownership of or contractual arrangement\nwith an operation or operations permitted to manage all such waste materials. A\ncontract with a hauler will only be accepted as proof of proper waste\nmanagement if documentation of management at an approved site or sites is\nincluded. In addition, all necessary State or Federal permits/approvals must\naccompany the submission. (ii)\n\nAll\nresidual material shall be removed within 180 calendar days after the system is\ntaken out of service. Proof of proper residuals management shall be submitted\nto the regional water engineer within 30 calendar days after their removal. The\ndates of removal and quantities removed shall be specified. (d) Upon satisfaction\nof closure requirements specified in subdivision (c) of this section, the\nregional water engineer shall be contacted, in writing, to schedule a final\nsite inspection of any disposal system which had a SPDES discharge permit to\nverify that influent and effluent pipes have been sealed and that all solid and\nresidual materials related to the treatment process have been\nremoved.
