  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 975.23 - Special Mobility Improvement Projects Related to Transit Enhancements within the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Authority for this sub-section is\nestablished by the Aid to Localities portion of the New York State Budget Act\nbeginning with 1993-1994 and any future appropriation, which specifies funding\nfor Special Mobility Projects Related to Transit Enhancements within the\n\nMetropolitan Commuter Transportation District. (b) Purpose. To provide seed money for the\ndevelopment and implementation of new and innovative services to improve\nmobility in the Metropolitan Commuter Transportation District. This money is\nintended to help overcome the traditional barriers to new and innovative\nservices. Grants awarded from this allocation may be for a period of up to two\nyears, subject to reappropriation in the second year by the\nlegislature. (c) Eligibility\nrequirements. All service providers, within the Metropolitan Commuter\n\nTransportation District eligible for funding under the State Mass\n\nTransportation Operating Assistance Program (STOA) are eligible to compete for\nfunding under this program. In addition, private for-profit, private\nnon-profit, quasi-public transit or ridesharing service providers are eligible\nand encouraged to compete for these funds. All applications must be sponsored\nby and any grant monies received will be contracted by a STOA-eligible public\nagency (City or County) or non-profit corporation whose project has been\nendorsed by a county in which the service is to be provided. Applicants\neligible under Section\n14-g\nof the\n\nTransportation Law may contract directly with the New York State Department of\n\nTransportation. Transit services now eligible under STOA such as express\ncommuter, suburb to suburb, local circulation, shuttle and feeder and reverse\ncommute services will be eligible under this new provision, provided that they\nconstitute new and innovative services that do not duplicate existing transit\nservice. In addition, certain activities not now eligible under STOA (17 NYCRR)\nmay be deemed eligible under this sub-section if they are deemed to be\ninnovative in addressing the mobility needs of the Metropolitan Commuter\n\nTransportation District. Such activities may include but are not limited to: employer based vanpooling, guaranteed ride home programs, and selective capital\ncosts that facilitate new and innovative services. (d) Application process. Applicants competing\nfor funding under this sub-section shall submit an application to the regional\noffice of the New York State Department of Transportation in which the service\nwill be provided. The address may be obtained from any of the regional offices\nin the metropolitan area, to include the following: (1)\nA Strategic Service Plan describing: (i) The market to be served; (ii)\n\nThe nature of the service (bus, van, feeder, reverse commute, etc.); (iii)\n\nThe estimated ridership; (iv)\nbudgeted total cost (operating and\ncapital) for the service, including the percentage funding split between this\nprogram and other sources; (v) Plan\nfor service provision following the 2 year grant eligibility period, provided\nthat the service performance warrants continued funding, including\nidentification of intended funding sources for continued service; (vi)\n\nOther plan components, in the form of\nrough estimates should include, as appropriate: (a) Availability of capital resources in\nplace for use by the new service: vehicles, parking facilities, stops and\npedestrian facilities; (b) Number\nand type of vehicles to be used; (c) General service routing\npossibilities; (d) Potential target\nheadways and span of service, if fixed route service is contemplated; (e) Key land uses to be served; (f) Availability of data resources for market\nidentification (i.e. existing origin/destination surveys, Census data and\n\nTransportation Management Association employer data); (g) Proposed approach to marketing and public\ninformation; (h) Operational plan, if demand responsive service is contemplated. (2)\nA narrative description of how the\nservice will address the objectives expressed in the selection criteria listed\nin the next section E below. (e) Selection criteria. The following\ncriteria will be used in determining which of the competing projects will\nreceive funding (The percentages listed in parenthesis reflect the relative\nweight of the selection criteria): (1)\n\nImprovements to regional mobility (50%)\n(i) Provision of regionally based service that cross City or County\nboundaries. (ii)\n\nFacilitate greater\nuse of the existing transit system by bridging gaps in existing transit\nservice. (feeder systems, reverse commute services, etc.)\n(iii)\n\nService is tailored to new development\nor redevelopment that has integrated transit into project design. (iv)\n\nConsultation with other regional\ntransportation and land use agencies, as appropriate. Such entities may\ninclude: Transportation Management Associations, New York Metropolitan\n\nTransportation Council, Long Island Railroad, Metropolitan Suburban Bus\n\nAuthority, Suffolk County Transit, Metro North, private providers of public\ntransportation, county planning agencies, municipal planning agencies, major\nemployers or business associations, NYSDOT Regional Offices; (2)\n\nThe amount of funds to be\ncontributed by the entity requesting assistance (25%)\n(i) Direct private sector employer or local\ngovernment participation in planning and funding; (ii)\n\nThe extent to which the service shows\nthe promise of being self-sustaining following the demonstration grant\nperiod; (iii)\n\nPotential for revenue\nto be gained during the grant period through farebox receipts. (3)\n\nThe cost effectiveness of the\nproject (10%)\n(i) Demonstrated commitment to\nmonitor service performance (i.e. conduct ridership surveys and document in\nterms cost per degree of reduction in vehicle hours of delay); (ii)\n\nThe extent to which the service utilizes\nexisting resources: existing capital investments (i.e. excess parking capacity\nat employer sites, existing vehicles, shelters, etc.) and existing data sources\n(i.e. O/D surveys, TMA employer databases, Census Journey to Work, etc.); (4)\n\nReductions in\ntraffic congestion: Estimated reduction in VMT resulting from trips diverted to\nthe new service (5%)\n(5)\n\nImprovements in air quality: Based on VMT reduction, estimated reduction in\nemissions (5%)\n(6)\n\nThe contribution\nthe project shall make in meeting other Federal and State requirements\n(5%)\n(f) Selection\nprocess. A project selection committee will review all applications and select\nthe proposals that will receive funding under this program, based upon the\nabove listed criteria. This committee will consist of representatives from\nNYSDOT Transit Division, NYSDOT Regional offices 8, 10 and NYMTC. Grant amounts\nwill be based on a committee review of budget projections found in the\napplication, total grant funds available and a balancing of the dual objectives\nof promoting the funding of as many projects as practicable as well as insuring\nthat any funded project has adequate funds to achieve the mobility goals of\nthis program. The maximum amount dedicated to any project funded out of this\nappropriation shall not exceed one half of the authorized appropriation in the\nfirst year of this grant and in any future years appropriation. (g) Contracting, funding disbursement and\nadministration. (1)\nA grant agreement between\nNYSDOT and the grantee with direct input from the actual service\nprovider/subgrantee, as appropriate will set out performance milestones to be\nmet within agreed upon reporting intervals. It is understood in developing\nthese milestones that start-up of new service is a risk venture and that\nguarantees of high ridership from day one of service are not possible. The\nintent is to stimulate innovative mobility services, which by definition carry\nfew guarantees of success. Performance milestones will thus be based on\nrealistic expectations for new service agreed upon by the grantee and\nNYSDOT. (2)\n\nFunding disbursement\nwill be based on these performance milestones to be met by the service provider\nat the specified reporting intervals. (i) Start-up funding, in an amount specified in the grant agreement, may be\nprovided up-front following the awarding of the grant. This will assist in\nmeeting the administrative, operating and capital costs of initiating\nservices. (ii)\n\nAt specified\nreporting intervals, the grantee will document services provided based upon\nperformance measures which may include: ridership, cost per rider, vehicle\nmiles, documentation of marketing activities and strategies undertaken and\ntheir results. After NYSDOT review of these reports at each interval and a\nfinding that the service has successfully met the agreed upon performance\nmilestones, funds will be disbursed according to a payment schedule contained\nin the grant agreement.
