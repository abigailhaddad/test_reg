No. 123: Declaring a Disaster in the Counties of Bronx, Kings, Nassau, New York, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester and Contiguous Areas\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, on January 21, 2014 and continuing thereafter, a\nstrong winter storm began to impact New York State and poses an imminent danger\nto vital public transportation, utility service, and public health and public\nsafety systems within the counties of Bronx, Kings, Nassau, New York, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester and contiguous areas; and\nWHEREAS, this winter storm is predicted to produce\nblizzard-like conditions, snowfall amounts of approximately one foot, winds in\nexcess of 40 miles per hour, and dangerously cold temperatures and wind chills, and these conditions may cause widespread power outages and roadway closures, damage to homes and businesses and public and private property, and will\ncontinue to pose a threat to public health and safety; NOW, THEREFORE, I, ANDREW M. CUOMO, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nthe Laws of the State of New York, do hereby find that a disaster is imminent\nto which the affected local governments are unable to respond adequately. Therefore, pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution of the\n\nState of New York and Section 28 of Article 2-B of the Executive Law, I hereby\ndeclare a State Disaster Emergency effective January 21, 2014 within the\nterritorial boundaries of the counties of Bronx, Kings, Nassau, New York, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Suffolk, Westchester and contiguous areas; and\nFURTHER, pursuant to Section 29 of Article 2-B of the\n\nExecutive Law, I direct the implementation of the State Comprehensive Emergency\n\nManagement Plan and authorize, effective January 21, 2014, the State Office of\n\nEmergency Management, the Department of Health, the Department of\n\nTransportation, the State Police, the Division of Military and Naval Affairs, the Department of Environmental Conservation, the State Department of\n\nCorrectional Services, the Public Service Commission, the Office of Fire\n\nPrevention and Control, the Department of Labor, the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, the Office of General Services, the State\n\nUniversity of New York, the Thruway Authority, the Division of Homeland\n\nSecurity and Emergency Services, other State agencies as necessary, and the\n\nAmerican Red Cross to take appropriate action to protect State property and to\nassist affected local governments and individuals in responding to and\nrecovering from this disaster, and to provide such other assistance as\nnecessary to protect the public health and safety.
