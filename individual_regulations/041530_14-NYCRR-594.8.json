Where\nappropriate, the family shall also be afforded such opportunity. (g) Determination of eligibility for\nacceptance in the teaching family home or community residence, including a\nCREDIT program, must be made, once all intake materials have been received, within 10 working days.

The discharge plan must\nset forth the resident's functional levels and family and community supports\nneeded to enable the youth to move home or live independently. Additionally, the discharge plan must identify goals for the youth to work towards which will\nstrengthen his or her success upon discharge. (j) As part of the discharge planning\nprocess, for both planned and unplanned discharges, the provider shall ensure\nthat each child or adolescent and family is linked with the appropriate\nservices needed for the youth to successfully transition into the community or\nother appropriate alternative.
