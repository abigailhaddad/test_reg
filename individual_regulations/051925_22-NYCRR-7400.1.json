This request will be granted if, in the discretion of the commission, the public interest does not require disclosure and the employee's duties do\nnot involve any of the duties set forth in section\n40.1\n(i)(8)\nof the\nrule. (c) Procedure. (1)\n\nAn employee individually, or an employee organization on behalf of persons who share the same job title, may request an exemption from filing a financial disclosure statement by filing\na written request with the commission on or before: (i) March 1st of the year in which the\nexemption is requested if he or she is employed by the Unified Court System on\n\nJanuary 1st, or commences employment from January 2nd through April 15th, of\nthat year; or\n(ii)\n15 days from the date that the employee commences employment (which includes a\nchange to a new job title that requires him or her to file) if he or she\ncommences employment with the Unified Court System from April 16th through\n\nDecember 31st of the year in which the exemption is requested. (2)\n\nThe request for\nthe exemption shall include: (i) the name, work address, home\naddress, work telephone number and job title of the employee if the request is\non an individual basis, or the name of the employee organization, and name, address and telephone number of its authorized representative filing on behalf\nof persons who share the same job title; (ii)\nthe job title for which an\nexemption is requested where the request is by an employee\norganization; (iii)\na copy of the title specifications of the job title for which an exemption is\nrequested; and\n(iv)\na statement in support of the claim of the filing employee or employee\norganization that the public interest does not require disclosure and that the\njob title for which the exemption is requested does not involve any of the\nduties set forth in section\n40.1\n(i)(8)\nof the\nrule, giving specific reasons and justifications therefor.

(3)\n\nThe request for an\nexemption must be signed by the employee, if requesting an individual\nexemption, or by the authorized representative of the employee organization\nrequesting an exemption on behalf of persons who share the same job\ntitle. (d) Commission action. (1)\n\nUpon receipt of a request\nfor an exemption from filing a financial disclosure statement, the commission\nshall review the material filed to determine whether the public interest\nrequires disclosure and whether the duties of the job title include any of the\nduties set forth in section\n40.1\n(i)(8)\nof the\nrule. (2)\n\nIf the\ncommission determines that additional information would be useful, it may\nobtain such information from the Office of Court Administration, from the\nindividual employee requesting an exemption, from the employee organization\nrequesting an exemption on behalf of persons who share the same job title, or\nfrom any source deemed appropriate by the commission. The commission, in its\ndiscretion, may request a meeting with the individual employee or the\nrepresentative of an employee organization to discuss the exemption\nrequest. (3)\n\nIf the\ncommission requests additional information from an individual employee or an\nemployee organization, such additional information must be filed with the\ncommission within the time limit set forth in the commission's written request. If the commission does not receive such information within the said time limit, it may render a decision on the information available. (4)\n\nUnless the commission\ndecides that the public interest does not require disclosure and that a job\ntitle does not involve the duties set forth in section\n40.1\n(i)(8)\nof the\nrule, the commission shall deny the request for an exemption from filing a\nfinancial disclosure statement. In applying the public interest standard, the\ncommission considers the duties the employee may be called upon to perform. The\ncommission weighs the strong public interest in disclosure against the\nemployee's privacy rights. In this weighing process, the commission considers\nthe employee's role in the judicial, administrative or managerial process of\nthe Unified Court System. The commission also considers the potential for\nconflict of interest and use of public office for personal gain in the\nperformance of the employee's actual or potential job duties. Judiciary Law, section 211(4) and Part 40 of this Title establish a strong public policy\nfavoring disclosure. Thus employees otherwise required to file, who have\nrequested an exemption from filing, must demonstrate that an individual\nexception to this policy is warranted. (5)\n\nThe commission shall give written\nnotification of this decision to the employee and/or the employee organization, as appropriate, and to the Chief Administrator of the Courts. (6)\n\nOnce an exemption has been\ngranted for a job title, an employee, as long as he or she holds that job\ntitle, will not be required to file a financial disclosure statement in any\nsubsequent year for which one would otherwise be required unless: (i) the duties of the job\ntitle change; or\n(ii)\nit is determined that the employee\nholds a policymaking position by: the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, as\nto personnel of that Court; the Presiding Justice of each Appellate Division, as to personnel of that Court; or the Chief Administrator of the Courts, as to\nall other state-paid personnel of the Unified Court System; or\n(iii)\nthe commission, upon\nreview of its decision to grant such exemption, determines the exemption is no\nlonger appropriate.
