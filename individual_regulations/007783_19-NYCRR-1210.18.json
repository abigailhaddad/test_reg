Tit. 19 § 1210.18 - Resolution of disputes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any\nhomeowner, retailer, manufacturer, installer, mechanic, or lending entity may\nfile a complaint with the Department of State seeking resolution of an\nallegation that a substantial defect exists in the delivered condition, installation, service or construction of a manufactured home. Any such\ncomplaint shall be in writing, shall be submitted on a form provided by or\notherwise acceptable to the Department of State; and shall specify the name and\naddress of each complaining party, the nature of the substantial defect alleged\nto exist, the name and address of the manufacturer, the retailer, and the\ninstaller of such manufactured home and, if applicable, the name and address of\neach mechanic who serviced the manufactured home. (b) A complaint relating to the delivered\ncondition, installation, service or construction of a manufactured home shall\nbe filed with the Department of State within one year and 10 days after the\ndate of the service, installation, or issuance of a certificate of occupancy, or the expiration of any applicable provision of a contract or warranty, whichever is later. (c) The\n\nDepartment of State shall review the complaint to determine whether the\ncomplaint, on its face, does or does not allege the existence of a substantial\ndefect in the delivered condition, installation, service, or construction of a\nmanufactured home. A determination by the Department of State pursuant to this\nsubdivision shall not be deemed to constitute a finding on the merits of the\ncomplaint, but shall merely be a determination whether the complaint, on its\nface, does or does not allege the existence of a substantial defect. (d) If the Department of State determines\nthat a complaint, on its face, fails to allege the existence of a substantial\ndefect, the Department of State shall notify the complaining party of such\ndetermination. The complaining party may thereafter file a new complaint, provided that such new complaint is filed within the time period specified in\nsubdivision (b) of this section. (e) If the Department of State determines\nthat the complaint, on its face, does allege the existence of a substantial\ndefect, the Department of State shall notify the complaining party and each\nresponding party of such determination, and the Department of State shall\nprovide each responding party with a copy of the complaint. Each responding\nparty shall, within 30 days after receipt of such notice and copy of the\ncomplaint, file a written response to the complaint with the Department of\n\nState, and provide a copy of such response to the complaining party. (f) The Department of State shall be\npermitted, but not required, to attempt to resolve any complaint on an informal\nbasis. Such informal complaint resolution process may be commenced at any time\nafter the complaint is filed, and may be continued at any time and from time to\ntime thereafter. During the course of such informal complaint resolution\nprocess, one or more employees of the Department of State may participate in\ntelephone calls to or from, or meetings with, any party or parties, with or\nwithout the participation by or presence of the other party or parties, and the\n\nDepartment of State may conduct such other investigation into the merits of the\ncomplaint as the Department of State may deem appropriate. No administrative\nlaw judge who may subsequently hear the matter shall participate in any such\ntelephone call or meeting or any such investigation. At any time during the\ninformal complaint resolution process, the Department of State may propose a\nmanner in which the complaint may be resolved, in whole or in part. If the\ncomplaining party and each responding party agree in writing to accept such\nproposed resolution, the Secretary of State or his or her designee shall make a\nconsent order reflecting such resolution. Any such consent order shall be final\nand binding when issued. (g) If the\n\nDepartment of State elects not to attempt to resolve the complaint on an\ninformal basis, or if any attempts to resolve the complaint on an informal\nbasis are unsuccessful, in whole or in part, the Department of State shall\nresolve the complaint by administrative hearing conducted by the Department of\n\nState's Office of Administrative Hearings pursuant to the State Administrative\n\nProcedure Act and Part 400 of this Title. The decision resolving the complaint\nfollowing an administrative hearing shall be made by the administrative law\njudge who conducted the hearing, shall be in writing, and shall provide the\nreasons for the decision. If the complaining party prevails, in whole or in\npart, the decision of the administrative law judge shall: (1)\ndirect compensation to the complaining\nparty in such amount as the administrative law judge shall determine to be\nappropriate, which amount shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited\nto: (i) filing fees, recording fees, inspection fees, and other required costs that the complaining party would not\nhave incurred had the manufactured home met applicable standards; and\n(ii)\nthe cost of conforming repairs or\nreplacements; and\n(2)\napportion liability between two or more parties, where appropriate. If\nappropriate, a portion of liability may be attributed to the complaining party, in which case the compensation awarded to the complaining party shall be\nadjusted accordingly. The amount of compensation awarded to a complaining party\nshall not be limited by the amount(s) in the deposit account(s) evidenced by\nthe acceptable deposit account control agreement(s), the amount(s) of the\nacceptable letter(s) of credit, or the amount(s) of the acceptable surety\nbond(s) provided by the responding party or parties determined to be liable. A\ncopy of the decision of the administrative law judge shall be provided to each\ncomplaining party and each responding party. The decision of the administrative\nlaw judge shall be final and binding when issued unless an appeal is taken\npursuant to subdivision (h) of this section.

A party upon whom an adverse party has served a memorandum of appeal may, within 30 calendar days after such service, file and serve a memorandum in\nopposition to appeal, a memorandum of cross- appeal, or both. A party upon whom\nan adverse party has served a memorandum of cross-appeal may, within 15\ncalendar days of such service, file and serve a memorandum in opposition to\ncross-appeal.
