  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 528.10 - Fuel sold to an airline for use in its airplanes\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1115(a)(9)\n(a) Exemption. Fuel sold to an airline for use in its airplanes is exempt\nfrom sales and use tax. (b) Airline defined. (1)\n\nAn\nairline\nis: (i) an air\ncarrier of persons, property and mail operating under a certificate of public\nconvenience and necessity issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board, or a foreign\nair carrier holding an equivalent certificate issued by the carrier's\nrespective sovereign government; (ii)\nan air carrier holding a certificate for\nall-cargo air service issued by the Civil Aeronautics Board; or\n(iii)\nan air taxi operator, who is classified\nby the Civil Aeronautics Board as a commuter air carrier, or who\n(\na\n) performs at least five round trips per week between two or\nmore points, and publishes flight schedules which specify the times and days of\nthe week and places between which such flights are performed, or\n(\nb\n) transports mail by air pursuant to contract with the\n\nUnited States Postal Service. This exemption shall extend to the purchase of\nfuel for use in such commuter flights. (2)\n\nAir taxi operators and commercial\noperators of small aircraft holding air taxi certificates issued by the Federal\n\nAviation Agency, which enable these operators to engage in carrying passengers\nor cargo for hire in air commerce, but who are not commuter air carriers, are\nnot airlines within the meaning of the Tax Law. (c) Fueling and defueling\ncharges. (1)\n\nTaxability of fueling\nservices furnished to an airline for use in its airplanes is dependent upon\nwhen title to the fuel vests in the airline. (i) When an airline purchases fuel from an\noil company, and is charged separately for testing, storage and fueling, such\ncharges are deemed to be part of the cost of the fuel sold and are exempt from\nthe sales and use tax. Example 1: A public authority which operates an airport requires that\nall fuel be tested and delivered by its agent. The agent charges the oil\ncompany for these services and the oil company passes these charges to its\nairline customers. These charges are exempt. (ii)\n\nWhen a airline has title to fuel and a\ncharge is made for delivering the fuel into its airplanes, such charge is\ntaxable as a service to tangible personal property. Example 2: An airline has fuel in a storage tank which had been taken\nout of its airplanes and stored for future use. A service company at the\nairport charges the airline for fueling its airplanes with the stored fuel. The\ncharges are taxable. (2)\n\nThe charge for defueling an airplane is a\ntaxable service to the airline as a service to tangible personal\nproperty. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
