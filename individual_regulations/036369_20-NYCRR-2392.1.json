  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2392.1 - Reasonable cause\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nWhere any person fails to timely file a\nreturn, fails to timely pay any taxes due or fails to meet or fulfill any other\nact or requirement of the Tax Law, thereby subjecting such person to the\nadditions to tax, penalties, or interest penalty imposed pursuant to section\n182-a (10)(b), 289-b (1)(a), 289-b (2), 433 (1)(a), 481 (1)(a)(i), 512 (1)(a), 527 (b), 658 (c)(4)(C)(i), 685 (a), 685 (f), 685 (h), 685 (o), 685 (u), 685 (v), 685 (w), 1085 (a), 1085 (n), 1085 (o), 1145 (a)(1)(i), 1145 (c), 1145 (e), or\n1416 (b)\nof the Tax Law, or\nthe interest amount imposed pursuant to section 1145(a)(1)(ii) of such law, the\napplicable additions to tax, penalties, interest penalty and/or the interest\namount, as listed above, must be imposed unless it is shown that such failure\nwas due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. In the event that\nthese amounts have been imposed and it is later determined any such failure was\ndue to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, all or part of these\namounts will be cancelled. The absence of willful neglect alone is not\nsufficient grounds for not imposing or for cancelling these amounts. (2)\n\nAs used in this section, the term\ntaxpayer means the person against whom the amounts described in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision have been assessed or are assessable. (3)\n\nAs used in this section, the phrase\narticles governed by article 27 of the Tax Law means and includes articles 9\n(Corporation Tax), 9-A (Franchise Tax on Business Corporations), 13 (Tax on\n\nUnrelated Business Income), 32 (Franchise Tax on Banking Corporations), 33\n(Franchise Taxes on Insurance Corporations) and 33-A (Tax on Independently\n\nProcured Insurance) of such law. (b) Except where reasonable cause exists or\nis presumed to exist pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, all of the\nfacts alleged as a basis for reasonable cause may be required to be\naffirmatively shown in a written statement made by the taxpayer. Where the\ntaxpayer is unable to provide such a statement or does not have a personal\nknowledge of such facts, a showing of reasonable cause may be made on the\ntaxpayer's behalf by an individual with a personal knowledge of such facts. In\ndetermining whether reasonable cause exists, in addition to an evaluation of\nsuch facts, the taxpayer's previous compliance record with respect to all of\nthe taxes imposed pursuant to the Tax Law may be taken into account. (c) (1)\n\nReasonable cause shall not be determined to exist as a basis for not imposing\nor for cancelling the additions to tax for failure to file a return, pursuant\nto section\n685 (a)(1)\nor\n1085 (a)(1)\nof the Tax Law, or for failure to pay the amount of tax shown on such return, pursuant to\nsection 685(a)(2) or 1085(a)(2) of such law, where it is determined that the\ntaxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized representative could have reasonably\nbeen expected to timely request extensions of time to file the return or\nextensions of time to pay the tax due, but failed to do so. However, reasonable\ncause may be determined to exist with respect to these additions to tax where: (i) no extensions of time to file the return\nor no extensions of time to pay the tax due have been requested and it is\ndetermined that, given the circumstances, it would have been unreasonable to\nexpect such extensions to be requested; (ii)\na taxpayer has complied with and\nexhausted all of the provisions with respect to extensions of time for filing\nthe return or extensions of time for paying the tax due but was nevertheless\nunable to file or to pay on or before the extended due dates; or\n(iii)\nfor purposes of the additions to tax\nunder 1085(a)(1) and (2), a taxpayer has attempted to comply, pursuant to\nsubparagraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, with the provisions relating to an\nextension of time for filing the return. (2)\nA showing of reasonable cause with\nrespect to the addition to tax under section\n685 (a)(2)\nof the Tax Law\nwill be presumed, with respect to any underpayment of tax, where the taxpayer\nhas: (i) satisfied the requirements of\nsection\n157.2\nof this Title, relating to an automatic extension of time for filing a tax\nreturn; and\n(ii)\nthe excess of the\namount of tax shown on the tax return over the amount of tax paid on or before\nthe date prescribed for the filing of the tax return (by virtue of tax\nwithheld, payments of estimated tax and the payment in full of the estimated\ntax liability pursuant to section\n157.2\n[a][4]\nof this Title) is no greater than 10 percent of the amount of tax shown on the\ntax return; and\n(iii)\nany balance\ndue shown on the tax return is remitted with such return. (3)\nA showing of reasonable cause with\nrespect to the additions to tax under section\n1085 (a)(2)\nof the Tax Law\n(except in the case of such an addition to tax imposed with respect to a\nliability arising under article 33-A of such law) will exist for purposes of\narticles 9-A, 13, 32 and 33, or will be presumed to exist for purposes of\narticle 9 or 22, with respect to any underpayment of tax, where the taxpayer\nhas a valid automatic or initial extension of time for filing the\nreturn. (4)\n\nThe existence or\npresumption of reasonable cause provided for in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this\nsubdivision will apply to only that period of time for which a taxpayer has a\nvalid automatic or initial extension of time for filing the return and, if any, the additional extensions of time for filing such return. (d) Grounds for reasonable cause. The\nfollowing exemplify grounds for reasonable cause, where clearly established by\nor on behalf of the taxpayer: (1)\n\nDeath, illness or absence. (i) The death or serious\nillness of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's unavoidable absence from its usual\nplace of business, which precluded timely compliance, may constitute reasonable\ncause, provided that: (a) in the case of the\nfailure to file any return, the applicable return is filed; or\n(b) in the case of the failure to pay, pay\nover or deposit any tax, such amount is paid, paid over or deposited, within a justifiable period of time after the death, illness\nor absence. A justifiable period of time is that period which is substantiated\nby or on behalf of the taxpayer as a reasonable period of time for filing the\nreturn and/or for paying any tax, based on the facts and circumstances in each\ncase. (ii)\n\nAs\nused in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the term taxpayer also includes: (a) for purposes of articles 12-A, 18, 20, 21, 21-A and 33-A of the Tax Law, a responsible partner, officer, director, shareholder, employee or other representative of the taxpayer; (b) for purposes of article 22 of the Tax\n\nLaw, a member of the taxpayer's family or the taxpayer's personal\nrepresentative or employer; (c) for\npurposes of the articles governed by article 27 of the Tax Law (not including, for purposes of this paragraph, article 33-A of such law), a responsible\nofficer, employee or other representative of the taxpayer; (d) for purposes of article 28 of the Tax\n\nLaw, a partner, responsible partner, officer, director, shareholder, employee\nor other representative of the taxpayer; and\n(e) for purposes of article 31 of the Tax\n\nLaw, any other person acting in a fiduciary or representative capacity for the\ntaxpayer. (2)\n\nDestruction of place of business or business records. (i) The destruction of the taxpayer's place\nof business or business records by a fire or other documented casualty, which\nprecluded timely compliance, may constitute reasonable cause, provided that: (a) in the case of the failure to file any\nreturn, the applicable return is filed; or\n(b) in the case of the failure to pay, pay\nover or deposit any tax, such amount is paid, paid over or deposited, within a justifiable period of time after the casualty has\ntaken place. A justifiable period of time is that period which is substantiated\nby or on behalf of the taxpayer as a reasonable period of time for filing the\nreturn and/or for paying any tax, based on the facts and circumstances in each\ncase. (ii)\n\nAs\nused in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the phrase taxpayer's place of\nbusiness or business records includes: (a) for purposes of articles 12-A, 18, 21, 21-A and 28 of the Tax Law and the\narticles governed by article 27 of such law, the place of business or business\nrecords of the taxpayer's representatives; (b) for purposes of article 20 of the Tax\n\nLaw, the place of business or business records of taxpayer's representative or\nthe taxpayer's inventory or stamps; (c) for purposes of article 22 of the Tax\n\nLaw, the place of business or business records of the taxpayer's personal\nrepresentative or employer, or the taxpayer's resident or income records\n(including wage and tax statements and returns of information); and\n(d) for purposes of article 31 of the Tax\n\nLaw, the place of business or the business records of any other person acting\nin a fiduciary or representative capacity for the taxpayer. (3)\n\nInability to timely\nassemble information. Except as provided in subdivision (e) of this section, the inability for reasons beyond the taxpayer's control to timely obtain and\nassemble essential information required for the preparation of a complete\nreturn, despite the exercise of reasonable efforts, may constitute reasonable\ncause provided a return, together with a statement of facts, is timely filed\nand any tax is timely paid or paid over on that portion of the tax liability\nwhich can be ascertained. The relevant facts affecting that portion of the tax\nliability which cannot be ascertained must be fully disclosed with the timely\nfiled return. When such liability is ascertained, and where applicable\ncollected, an amended return must be immediately filed together with payment of\nany additional tax due. (4)\n\nPending\npetitions, actions or proceedings. A pending petition to the Commissioner of\n\nTaxation and Finance for an advisory opinion or a declaratory ruling, a pending\nconciliation conference proceeding in the Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation\n\nServices of the Division of Taxation, a pending petition to the Division of Tax\n\nAppeals or a pending action or proceeding for judicial determination may\nconstitute reasonable cause, until the time at which the taxpayer has exhausted\nits administrative or judicial remedies, as applicable, for one or more taxable\nperiods (or conveyances for purposes of article 31 of the Tax Law), the return\nor returns for which are due subsequent to the filing of the petition with the\n\nCommissioner of Taxation and Finance, the commencement of the conciliation\nconference proceeding, the filing of the petition with the Division of Tax\n\nAppeals or the commencement of the judicial action or proceeding. The ground\nfor reasonable cause described in this paragraph is subject to the following\nconditions: (i) the petition, action or\nproceeding must involve a question or issue affecting whether or not the person\nor entity or conveyance is subject to tax and/or required to file a return or, for purposes of article 28 of the Tax Law, whether such person or entity is\nrequired to file a return and collect and remit sales tax or file a return and\npay use tax; (ii)\nthe petition, action or proceeding must not be based on a position which is frivolous nor may\nit be intended to delay or impede the administration of the applicable article\nof the Tax Law; and\n(iii)\nthe facts\nand circumstances for such taxable period(s) or conveyance(s) must be identical\nor virtually identical to those covered by the petition, action or\nproceeding. (5)\n\nAdditional grounds. Any other ground for delinquency which would appear to a\nperson of ordinary prudence and intelligence as a reasonable cause for delay\nand which clearly indicates an absence of willful neglect may be determined to\nbe reasonable cause. (e) (1)\n\nExcept as provided for in paragraph (3)\nof this subdivision, for purposes of article 22 of the Tax Law and for purposes\nof the articles governed by article 27 of such law, an inability to timely\nobtain and assemble essential information (including wage and tax statements or\nreturns of information from an employer or payor) required for the preparation\nof a complete return shall not be a basis for reasonable cause. (2)\n\nWhere an inability to timely obtain and\nassemble essential information required for the preparation of a complete\nreturn exists and where extensions of time for filing the return are available, such extensions of time for filing must be obtained, a return which reflects\nthe known tax liability must be filed on or before the extended due date for\nfiling, and any balance of tax must be paid with the return on that portion of\nthe tax liability which can be ascertained and shown on such return. The\nrelevant facts affecting that portion of the tax liability which cannot be\nascertained must be fully disclosed with such timely filed returns. When such\nliability is ascertained, an amended return must be immediately filed together\nwith any additional tax due. (3)\n(i) However, for purposes of the articles\ngoverned by article 27 of the Tax Law, where a taxpayer: (a) makes a timely application for an\nextension of time to file the return; (b) makes a good-faith effort to properly\nestimate the tax due; and\n(c) pays\nwith the application for extension of time for filing any unpaid balance of the\ntax as estimated; an inability for reasons beyond the taxpayer's control to\nobtain and assemble essential information may constitute reasonable cause for\nfailure to file a return and for failure to pay the amount shown as tax on the\nreturn, where such inability precluded the taxpayer from properly estimating\nthe tax as finally determined thereby invalidating the extensions of time for\nfiling the return. (ii)\n\nIn support of the ground described in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph as a basis for reasonable cause, the\ntaxpayer or the taxpayer's representative must: (a) indicate why the estimated tax would not\nbe predicated on the preceding year's tax; (b) indicate what information was\nunavailable; (c) explain the reason\nor reasons why such information was unavailable, despite reasonable efforts by\nor on behalf of the taxpayer to obtain the missing information; and\n(d) further explain how the original\nestimation of tax was derived and what allowances, if any, were included in the\nestimation to provide for the unknown tax liability. (iii)\n\nWhere the Tax Law does not provide for\nan extension of time for filing, a return which reflects the known tax\nliability must be filed on or before the prescribed due date for filing and the\ntax must be paid with the return on that portion of the tax liability which can\nbe ascertained and shown on such return. The relevant facts affecting that\nportion of the tax liability which cannot be ascertained must be fully\ndisclosed with such timely filed returns. When such liability is ascertained, an amended return must be immediately filed together with any additional tax\ndue. (f) The\nprovisions of this section shall apply to the extent pertinent where any person\nis subject to the penalty imposed by section\n685 (k)\nof the Tax Law. in\naddition to any relevant grounds for reasonable cause as exemplified in\nsubdivision (d) of this section, further grounds for reasonable cause for\nfailure to secure and supply any identifying numbers (as described in such\nsection 685[k]), where clearly established, may include the following: (1)\na reliance in good faith on an\nidentifying number provided to such person which subsequently proves to be\nerroneous; or\n(2)\nawaiting the\nissuance of an identifying number or the inability to secure an identifying\nnumber despite repeated, documentable attempts to do so. (g) (1)\n\nThe\nprovisions of this section shall apply to the extent pertinent where any\ntaxpayer is subject to the additions to tax or penalties imposed pursuant to\nsections\n685 (p), 1085 (k)\nand\n1145 (a)(1)(vi)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw and such understatement or omission (as described in such sections), or\npart thereof, was due to reasonable cause and, for purposes of section\n1145(a)(1)(vi), is not due to willful neglect. In such a case, reasonable\ncause, and the absence of willful neglect, if applicable, may be determined to\nexist only where the taxpayer has acted in good faith. Further, reasonable\ncause and good faith, and the absence of willful neglect, if applicable, shall\nbe considered as a basis for cancellation or waiver of all or part of the\nassessed or assessable additions to tax or penalties imposed pursuant to such\nsections of the Tax Law only after the understatement of tax or omission has\nbeen reduced, in accordance with the provisions of such sections, by that\nportion of the tax attributable to any item for which there is or was\nsubstantial authority for the tax treatment thereof, or for which the relevant\nfacts affecting the tax treatment were adequately disclosed with the original\nreturn, if applicable. (2)\n\nIn\ndetermining whether reasonable cause and good faith exist, the most important\nfactor to be considered is the extent of the taxpayer's efforts to ascertain\nthe proper tax liability. In addition to any relevant grounds for reasonable\ncause as exemplified in subdivision (d) of this section, circumstances that\nindicate reasonable cause and good faith with respect to the substantial\nunderstatement or omission of tax, where clearly established by or on behalf of\nthe taxpayer, may include the following: (i) an honest misunderstanding of fact or law that is reasonable in light of the\nexperience, knowledge and education of the taxpayer; (ii)\na computational or transcriptional\nerror; (iii)\nthe filing of an\namended return which shows an additional amount of tax due or which adequately\ndiscloses the tax treatment of an item which should have been adequately\ndisclosed with the original return, provided the amended return is filed prior\nto the time the taxpayer is first contacted by the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance concerning an audit or an examination of the return; and\n(iv)\nthe reliance by the taxpayer on any\nwritten information, professional advice or other facts, provided such reliance\nwas reasonable and the taxpayer had no knowledge of circumstances which should\nhave put the taxpayer upon inquiry as to whether such facts were erroneous; (a) reliance on professional advice. The\nprovisions regarding a taxpayer's reliance on professional advice found in this\nsubparagraph shall be applied as follows: (1)\nfacts and circumstances; minimum and requirements. All facts and circumstances\nmust be taken into account in determining whether a taxpayer has reasonably\nrelied in good faith on professional advice as to the treatment of the taxpayer\nunder the Tax Law. However, in no event will a taxpayer be considered to have\nreasonably relied in good faith on professional advice unless the requirements\nof this subclause are satisfied. The fact that these requirements are satisfied\nwill not necessarily establish that the taxpayer reasonably relied in good\nfaith on professional advice. For example, reliance may not be reasonable or in\ngood faith if the taxpayer knew, or should have known, that the advisor lacked\nknowledge in the relevant aspects of the Tax Law; (i) all facts and circumstances considered. The advice must be based upon all pertinent facts and circumstances and the law\nas it relates to those facts and circumstances. For example, the advice must\ntake into account the taxpayer's purposes (and the relative weight of such\npurposes) for entering into a transaction and for structuring a transaction in\na particular manner. In addition, the requirements of this subclause are not\nsatisfied if the taxpayer fails to disclose a fact that it knows, or should\nknow, to be relevant to the proper tax treatment of an item; (ii)\nno unreasonable assumptions. The advice\nmust not be based on unreasonable factual or legal assumptions (including\nassumptions as to future events) and must not unreasonably rely on the\nrepresentations, statements, findings, or agreements of the taxpayer or any\nother person. For example, the advice must not be based upon a representation\nor assumption which the taxpayer knows, or has reason to know, is unlikely to\nbe true, such as an inaccurate representation or assumption as to the\ntaxpayer's purposes for entering into a transaction or for structuring a\ntransaction in a particular manner; (2)\nadvice must be reasonable. Reliance upon\nprofessional advice as a basis for reasonable cause will not be supported where\nthe advice received is unreasonable. For example, professional advice may be\nconsidered to be unreasonable where such advice is contrary to written guidance\nor published information applicable or relevant to the given facts or\ncircumstances. (3)\n\nNo inference\nshall be drawn from any of the provisions of this subdivision with respect to\nestablishing reasonable cause pursuant to any other subdivision of this\nsection. However, the provisions of subparagraphs (2)(i) and (iv) of this\nsubdivision may be applicable, under the appropriate circumstances, to\nestablishing reasonable cause pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section, (see\nparagraph [d][5] of this section). (h) The provisions of this section\nshall also apply to the extent pertinent where any person is subject to penalty\nunder section 1145(a)(3), 1145(a)(4), 1145(g) or 1145(h). A determination of\nreasonable cause with respect to these failures will be based on the facts and\ncircumstances leading to the failure at issue. It must be established by or on\nbehalf of a person described in this subdivision that the failure occurred\ndespite the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence. (i) (1)\n\nPursuant to statutory provisions for joint administration and applicability, the provisions of this section will also apply as follows: (i) to the extent that the provisions of this\nsection apply to article 12-A of the Tax Law, they will also apply to the taxes\nimposed pursuant to article 13- A (Tax on Petroleum Businesses) of such\nlaw; (ii)\nto the extent that the\nprovisions of this section apply to article 22 of the Tax Law, they will also\napply to the taxes imposed pursuant to articles 26 (Estate Tax) and 26-A (Gift\n\nTax) and to the local taxes imposed pursuant to the authority of articles 30\n(City of New York Personal Income Tax on Residents), 30-A (City of Yonkers\n\nIncome Tax Surcharge on Residents) and 30-B (City of Yonkers Earnings Tax on\n\nNonresidents) of such law, and to article 2-E (City of New York Earnings Tax on\n\nNonresidents) of the General City Law; and\n(iii)\nto the extent that the provisions of\nthis section apply to article 28 of the Tax Law, they will also apply to the\ntaxes imposed pursuant to article 28- A (Passenger Car Rentals) and to the\ntaxes imposed pursuant to the authority of article 29 (Local Enabling Act) of\nsuch law.
