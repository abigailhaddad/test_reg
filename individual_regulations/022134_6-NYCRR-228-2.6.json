Tit. 6 §§ 228-2.6 - Compliance procedures and test methods\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as provided in sections\n228-2.2, 228-2.4\nand\n228-2.5\nof this Subpart, the VOC\nand solids content of all non-aerosol adhesives, adhesive primers and cleanup\nsolvents shall be determined using U.S. EPA Reference Method 24, as identified\nin 40 CFR\n60, appendix A, or SCAQMD Method 304-91. (b) The organic content of exempt organic\ncompounds shall be determined using ASTM D4457-02. (c) The VOC content of any plastic welding\ncement adhesive or primer shall be determined using SCAQMD Method\n316A-92. (d) To determine if a\ndiluent is a reactive diluent, the percent of the reactive organic compound\nthat becomes an integral part of the finished materials shall be determined\nusing SCAQMD Method 316A-92. (e) The\ncomposite vapor pressure of organic compounds in cleaning materials shall be\ndetermined by quantifying the amount of each compound in the blend using gas\nchromatographic analysis ASTM E 260-96 (2006) for organics and ASTM D3792-05\nfor water content, as applicable, and the following equation: Image\n1\n\nWhere: Ppc = VOC composite partial pressure at 20° C, in mm\n\nHg. Wi = Weight of the \"i\"th VOC compound, in grams, as\ndetermined by ASTM E 260- 96. Ww = Weight of water, in grams as determined by ASTM D\n3792-05. We = Weight of the \"i\"th exempt compound, in grams, as\ndetermined by ASTM E 260-96. Mwi = Molecular weight of the \"i\"th VOC compound, in\ngrams per g-mole, as given in chemical reference literature. Mww = Molecular weight of water, 18 grams per\ng-mole. Mwe = Molecular weight of the \"i\"th exempt compound, in\ngrams per g-mole, as given in chemical reference literature. Vpi = Vapor pressure of the \"i\"th VOC compound at 20° C, in mm Hg, as determined by subdivision (f) of this section. (f) The vapor pressure of each single\ncomponent compound may be determined from ASTM D2879-97 or may be obtained from\na source approved by SCAQMD, other California air districts, or the\ndepartment. (g) If air pollution\ncontrol equipment is used to meet the requirements of this Subpart, the owner\nor operator shall make the following determinations: (1)\nthe measurement of capture efficiency\nshall be conducted and reported in accordance with the EPA Technical Document\n'Guidelines for Determining Capture Efficiency', issued January 9, 1995; and\n(2)\nthe control efficiency\nshall be determined in accordance with U.S. EPA Reference Methods 25, 25A, and\n25B found at 40 CFR part\n60\nappendix A, and CARB Method 100. (h) The active and passive solvent\nlosses from spray gun cleaning systems shall be determined using SCAQMD's\n'General Test Method for Determining Solvent Losses from Spray Gun Cleaning\n\nSystems', dated October 3, 1989. The test solvent for this determination shall\nbe any lacquer thinner with a minimum vapor pressure of 105 mm of Hg at 20° C, and the minimum test temperature shall be 15° C. (i) For adhesives that do not contain\nreactive diluents, grams of VOC per liter of adhesive, less water and exempt\ncompounds, shall be calculated according to the following equation: Image\n2\n\nWhere: Ws = weight of volatile compounds, in grams. Ww = weight of water, in grams. We = weight of exempt compounds, in grams. Vm = volume of material, in liters. Vw = volume of water, in liters. Ve = volume of exempt compounds, in liters. (j) For adhesives that contain\nreactive diluents, the VOC content of the adhesive is determined after curing. The grams of VOC per liter of adhesive, less water and exempt compounds, shall\nbe calculated according to the following equation: Image\n3\n\nWhere: Wrs = weight of volatile compounds not consumed during\ncuring, in grams. Wrw = weight of water not consumed during curing, in\ngrams. Wre = weight of exempt compounds not consumed during\ncuring, in grams. Vrm = volume of material not consumed during curing, in\nliters. Vrw = volume of water not consumed during curing, in\nliters. Vre = volume of exempt compounds not consumed during\ncuring, in liters. (k) Grams\nof VOC per liter of material shall be calculated according to the following\nequation: Image\n4\n\nWhere: Ws = weight of volatile compounds, in grams. Ww = weight of water, in grams. We = weight of exempt compounds, in grams. Vm = volume of material, in liters. (l) Percent VOC by weight shall be calculated\naccording to the following equation: % VOC by weight = [(Wv / W)] x 100\n\nWhere: Wv= weight of VOCs in grams. W = weight of material in\ngrams.
