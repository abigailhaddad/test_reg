Tit. 20 § 544.3 - Sales of mobile homes and factory manufactured homes\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1101 (b)(4)(i), 1105(a), 1111(f), 1115(a)(23)\n(a) Sales of mobile\nhomes. (1)\n\nSales of new mobile homes by\nmanufacturers to dealers, and sales to contractors, subcontractors or repairmen\nwho in such capacity install a mobile home on real property are not subject to\ntax provided the purchaser presents a properly completed resale certificate, where the purchaser is a dealer, or a properly completed contractor exempt\npurchase certificate, where the purchaser is a contractor, subcontractor or\nrepairman. (2)\n\nThe retail sales tax\nimposed under section\n1105 (a)\nof the Tax Law and\nthe compensating use tax imposed under section\n1110\nof the Tax Law, with respect to new\nmobile homes, is computed on 70 percent of the receipts or consideration given\nby the purchaser or user. The dealer, or contractor, subcontractor or repairman\nselling a new mobile home must collect the retail sales tax from the purchaser. (i) The \"70 percent rule\" applies only to the\nselling price allocable to a new mobile home including any tangible personal\nproperty, permanently incorporated as component parts by the manufacturer, and\nis not applicable to furniture, fixtures, furnishings, appliances, attachments\nor similar tangible personal property not permanently incorporated as component\nparts of the mobile home at the time of manufacture. (ii)\n\nItems of tangible personal property\nincluded in a mobile home by a manufacturer or dealer which are not permanently\nincorporated as component parts, such as furniture, draperies and freestanding\nappliances, are taxable to the purchaser at 100 percent of their selling price. Any invoice given to the purchaser must separately list\neach item of tangible personal property (not permanently incorporated as a\ncomponent part at the time of manufacture) sold with the mobile home along with\nits applicable selling price. A copy should be retained by the dealer for his\nrecords. Example 1: A customer purchased a new mobile home from a dealer in a 7\npercent taxing jurisdiction. The mobile home contained tangible personal\nproperty permanently incorporated as component parts by the manufacturer such\nas a water heater, a furnace, sinks, cabinets, and counter tops. The unit also\ncontained a range, an oven, a refrigerator, a dishwasher and other furnishings\nwhich were not incorporated as component parts at the time of manufacture and\nare thus taxed as tangible personal property. The invoice given to the customer showed: A total retail price of $25,000 for mobile home\nincluding separately listed items of tangible personal property totaling\n$5,000\n\nPortion of total selling price to which\nthe 70 percent rule is applied: Total retail price of mobile home\n$25,000\n\nLess: Price of items of tangible personal\nproperty\n-$ 5,000\n\nPortion of selling price to which the 70 percent rule\napplies\n$20,000\n\nComputation of taxable portion of retail\nselling price of mobile home (excluding items of tangible personal\nproperty): Portion of retail selling price to which the \"70\npercent rule\" applies\n$20,000\n\nMultiply by 70 percent\n×.70\n\nTaxable portion of retail selling price (excluding\nitems of tangible personal property)\n$14,000\n\nComputation of tax on taxable portion of\nmobile home (excluding items of tangible personal property): Taxable portion of retail selling price per\nabove\n$14,000\n\nMultiply by tax rate of 7 percent\n×.07\n\nTax on taxable portion of mobile home (excluding\nitems of tangible personal property)\n$980\n\nComputation of tax on items of tangible\npersonal property: Price of the tangible personal property\n$5,000\n\nMultiply by tax rate of 7 percent\n×.07\n\nTax on the tangible personal property\n$ 350\n\nComputation of total tax on mobile\nhome: Tax on taxable portion of mobile home (excluding\nitems of tangible personal property, plus\n$ 980\n\nTax on the tangible personal property\n+ 350\n\nTotal tax on mobile home\n$1,330\n(3)\n\nWhen a mobile home is accepted in trade\nas a part payment on a new mobile home, the reduction in the amount of the\nreceipt subject to tax attributable to the trade-in must first be applied to\nthe total selling price of the new mobile home including all items of tangible\npersonal property. The amount remaining is then apportioned between (i) the\nprice of the new mobile home excluding the tangible personal property not\npermanently incorporated as a component part, and (ii) the selling price of\nsuch tangible personal property not incorporated as a component part of the\nmobile home, in the same proportion each such price bears to the total selling\nprice. Cross-reference: See section\n526.5\n(f) with respect to property accepted in trade. Example 2: Assume, as in example 1 a new mobile home is sold for\n$25,000 (including separately listed items of tangible personal property\ntotaling $5,000), except that the purchaser was given a trade-in allowance of\n$5,200. The portion that each element of\nthe selling price is to the total selling price is computed as\nfollows: Amount\n\nPercent of Total\n\nSelling price excluding tangible\n$20,000\npersonal property\n÷\nDivide by total selling price\n$25,000 × 100% =\n80%\nSelling price of items of\n$5,000\ntangible personal property\n÷\n$25,000 × 100% =\n20%\nTotal\n100%\nThe amount of trade-in attributable\nto each element of the total selling price is then computed as\nfollows: Element of Total Selling Price\n\nPercent of Each Element to Total\n\nTrade-in Amount\n\nProportion of Trade-in Attributable to Each\n\nElement\n\nSelling price excluding tangible personal\nproperty\n80% ×\n$5,200 =\n$4,160\n\nItems of tangible personal property\n20% ×\n$5,200 =\n$1,040\n\nTotal\n100%\n$5,200\n\nThe taxable portion of the selling price\nof the mobile home excluding tangible personal property not permanently\nincorporated as a component part at the time of manufacture is then\ncomputed: Amount\n\nTotal retail price of mobile home\n$25,000\n\nLess: Price of tangible personal\nproperty\n-$ 5,000\n\nPrice excluding tangible personal\nproperty\n$20,000\n\nLess: Proportionate amount of\ntrade-in\n-$ 4,160\n\nPortion of total selling price to which\nthe \"70 percent rule\" applies\n$15,840\n\nPortion taxable and tax due thereon is\nthen determined: Portion taxable\n$15,840 × 70 =\n$11,088\n\nMultiply by tax rate\n×.07\n\nApplicable tax\n$776.16\n\nItems of tangible personal property\n$5,000\n\nLess: Proportionate trade-in amount\n$1,040\n\nNet\n$3,960\n\nMultiply by applicable tax rate.07\n$277.20\n\nTotal tax due\n$1,053.36\n(4)\n\nThe sale of a used mobile home is exempt from the sales and compensating use\ntax. Items of tangible personal property included in the sale and which were\nnot permanently incorporated as a component part of the mobile home at the time\nof manufacture are subject to the sales and compensating use tax. (b) Sales of factory\nmanufactured homes. (1)\n\nThe sale of a\nfactory manufactured home which has not been installed on real property as a\ncapital improvement is subject to the sales and compensating use taxes as the\nsale of tangible personal property. Upon a retail sale, tax is computed on the\ntotal sales price. The \"70 percent rule\" described in subparagraph (a)(2)(i) of\nthis section does not apply to the sale or use of a factory manufactured\nhome. (2)\n\nThe sale of a factory\nmanufactured home to a contractor, subcontractor or repairman to be installed\nas a capital improvement by such contractor, subcontractor or repairman is\nsubject to sales and compensating use tax as a retail sale of tangible personal\nproperty.
