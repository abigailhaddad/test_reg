A driver is permitted to carry only a black whip that\nshall not exceed four feet in length, plus a snapper not longer than six\ninches. No leather or unusual materials may be used. The conventional snapper\nshall not be knotted. Tape is permitted only on the handle of the whip. All\nother modifications of the whip are prohibited. (b) Prohibitions on urging. No person shall\npossess or use any goading device or mechanical or electric device or appliance\nother than a whip specified in subdivision (a) of this section, either while\nracing, training or at any other time on the track premises. (c) Allowable urging during a race. A driver\nmay use a whip or the lines only in the conventional manner, in accordance with\nthe following: (1)\nthe driver must keep a\nline in each hand, except as may be necessary to adjust equipment (i.e., pulling plugs, dropping blinkers, etc.) while racing, training or at any other\ntime when driving a horse on the track premises; (2)\nlines shall remain reasonably taut during\na race; (3)\nuse of the whip shall\nbe restricted to forearm and wrist action only such that a driver's elbows must\nremain reasonably tucked and not raised above the driver's shoulder. For\navoidance of doubt, raising the lines and using the whip with wrist-action only\nis permissible; (4)\na driver is\npermitted to use the whip to hit the wheel disc or shaft so long as the whip\ndoes not interfere with another horse or driver; and\n(5)\na driver is permitted to use a hand or\nthe whip in a sliding, gliding or tapping manner about the level of the\narch. (d) Excessive or\nindiscriminate use of whip. While on the track premises at any time, no one\nshall use a whip in an excessive, indiscriminate, injurious, abusive or\nunnecessary manner, as the judges may determine in their discretion. The\nfollowing actions shall be considered as excessive or indiscriminate use of the\nwhip: (1)\ncausing an injury to the horse with\nthe whip; (2)\nusing the whip more\nthan three times in succession without giving the horse time to respond to the\nurging; (3)\nusing the whip on a\nhorse that is not visibly responding; (4)\nusing the whip on a tired horse or\ncontinuing to use the whip when the horse is not reasonably advancing or\nmaintaining its position in the race; (5)\nusing the whip after the finish\nline; (6)\nusing the handle of the\nwhip on a horse in any manner; (7)\nstriking another horse or driver with the whip or using the whip in a manner\nthat interferes with another horse or driver; (8)\nmovement by the driver of their body or\narms in an exaggerated manner; (9)\nwhipping under the arch or shafts of the sulky; (10)\nplacing the whip between a horse's legs; or\n(11)\ncontacting the horse with\nthe whip on the horse's hocks or below. Notwithstanding the prohibitions described in this\nsection, a driver may use the whip in any reasonable manner to ensure the\nsafety of the horses and drivers in the race. (e) Kicking prohibited. The kicking of a\nhorse is prohibited. Kicking, for purposes of this subdivision, means\ndelivering a blow or thrust with the foot against any part of the horse's body\nor impelling by striking with the foot at any time on the track premises, including before, during or after a race. (f) Foot out of stirrup. A driver found to\nhave removed a foot from the stirrups shall be punished as if the driver were\nfound to have kicked a horse. Additionally, it shall be considered a kicking\nviolation if a driver makes any contact with a horse while both feet are in or\nout of the stirrups or any foot supports. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a\ndriver is allowed, in the discretion of the judges, to remove a foot from the\nstirrup temporarily for the purpose of pulling earplugs or to adjust\nequipment. (g) Head poles. Head\npoles may be used on a horse but shall not protrude more than 10 inches beyond\nthe horse's nose. (h) Penalties. (1)\n\nThe penalties for a kicking violation of\nthis rule are as follows, depending on the severity of the violation: Suspension\n\nFirst offense\n30 days\n\nSecond offense\n90 days\n\nThird offense\n\nLicense revocation\n(2)\n\nThe penalties for a non-kicking violation\nof this rule are as follows, depending on the severity of the violation: Suspension\n\nFine\n\nFirst offense\nnone\n$100\n\nSecond offense\n3 days\n$250\n\nThird offense\n7 days\n$500\n\nFourth offense\n15 days\n$1,000\n\nFifth or subsequent offense\n\nFor each subsequent offense, the penalty for\nboth suspension days and the amount of the fine shall be double the last\npenalty imposed. When calculating penalties for successive non-kicking\nviolations under this section, any kicking violation that occurs between\nnon-kicking violations shall be considered and equated to three non-kicking\noffenses for purposes of calculating escalating penalties for non-kicking\nviolations. (3)\nA driver's\npenalty shall be based on the number of offenses that the driver has had across\nall racetracks in the United States and, to the extent records are available to\nthe judges, Canada, over the 365-day period that includes and immediately\nprecedes the date of the most recent offense. (4)\n\nAny brutal or indiscriminate use of the\nwhip or excessive number of offenses may subject a driver to license\nrevocation, without regard to the number of offenses. (5)\n\nIn addition to the penalties set forth in\nthis subdivision, the violation of any of the provisions in this section may\nresult in loss of placement or disqualification if, in the discretion of the\njudges, the driver and horse gained an unfair advantage due to such\nviolation. (6)\n\nNothing in the\npenalties set forth in this subdivision shall preclude a judge, as the\ncircumstances may warrant, from referring a licensee to the commission for a\nreview of the character and fitness of such licensee to hold a racing\nlicense.
