(b) For the purposes of distributions in accordance with this section, each hospital's relative uncompensated care need amount shall be determined in accordance with the following: (1)\n\nAll uninsured inpatient units of service as reported in exhibit 32 of the institutional cost report from the cost reporting year two years prior to the distribution year, but excluding hospital-based residential health care facility (\"RHCF\") and hospice units of service, shall be multiplied by the average applicable Medicaid inpatient rate in effect for January 1st of the distribution year. (2)\n\nAll uninsured outpatient units of service as reported in exhibit 33 of the institutional cost report from the cost reporting year two years prior to the distribution year, but excluding referred ambulatory and home health services, shall be multiplied by the average applicable Medicaid outpatient rate in effect for January 1st of the distribution year. (3)\n\nThe inpatient amounts determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision for each hospital shall be summed and adjusted by a statewide inpatient cost adjustment factor equivalent to the aggregate sum of the inpatient uninsured units multiplied by the step-down cost per unit for each applicable inpatient service, excluding hospital-based RHCF and hospice services, for all hospitals statewide, divided by the aggregate sum of the amounts determined pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision for all hospitals statewide. (4)\n\nThe outpatient amounts determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision for each hospital shall be summed and adjusted by a statewide outpatient cost adjustment factor equivalent to the aggregate sum of the outpatient uninsured units multiplied by the step-down cost per unit for each applicable outpatient service, excluding referred ambulatory and home health services, for all hospitals statewide, divided by the aggregate sum of the amounts determined pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision for all hospitals statewide.

(6)\n\nThe uncompensated care nominal need for each hospital shall be calculated as the net adjusted uncompensated care need multiplied by the sum of: (i) 0.40; and\n(ii)\nthe Medicaid inpatient utilization rate multiplied by 0.60.
