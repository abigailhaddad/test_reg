  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 25.25 - Provisional appointments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Provisional appointments authorized. Whenever there is no appropriate eligible list available for filling a vacancy\nin the competitive class, the appointing authority may appoint provisionally to\nfill such vacancy a person who qualifies by noncompetitive examination until a\nselection and appointment can be made after competitive examination. Such\nnoncompetitive examination may consist of a review and evaluation of the\ntraining, experience and other qualifications of the nominee, without written, oral or other performance tests. (b) Time limitation on provisional\nappointments. No provisional appointment shall continue for a period in excess\nof nine months. The Chief Administrator of the Courts shall order a competitive\ncivil service examination for any position held by provisional appointment for\na period of one month. Such an examination shall be conducted, as soon as\npracticable thereafter, to prevent the provisional appointment from continuing\nfor a period in excess of nine months. (c) Termination of provisional\nappointments. A provisional appointment to any position shall be terminated\nwithin two months following the establishment of an appropriate eligible list\nfor filling vacancies in such positions; provided, however, that where there\nare a large number of provisional appointees to be replaced by permanent\nappointees from a newly established eligible list, and the appointing authority\ndeems that the termination of the employment of all such provisional appointees\nwithin two months following establishment of such list would disrupt or impair\nessential public services, the appointing authority may terminate the\nemployment of various numbers of such provisional appointees at stated\nintervals; provided, however, that the employment of any such provisional\nappointee shall not be continued longer than four months following the\nestablishment of such eligible list. (d) Successive provisional appointments. Successive provisional appointments shall not be made to the same position\nafter the expiration of the authorized period of the original provisional\nappointment to such position; provided, however, that where an examination for\na position or group of positions fails to produce a list adequate to fill all\npositions then held on a provisional basis, or where such list is exhausted\nimmediately following its establishment, a new provisional appointment may be\nmade to any such position remaining unfilled by permanent appointment, and such\nnew provisional appointment may, in the discretion of the appointing authority, be given to a current or former provisional appointee in such position, except\nthat a current or former provisional appointee who becomes eligible for\npermanent appointment to any such position shall, if he or she is then to be\ncontinued in or appointed to any such position, be afforded permanent\nappointment to such position. (e) Provisional service credit towards probation. Any person appointed\nprovisionally who receives a permanent appointment to the same title under the\nsupervision of the same administrative authority immediately following the\nprovisional appointment shall have all time spent as a provisional appointee\ncredited to any probationary term that is required upon permanent appointment\nto such position. (f) Provisional\nservice credit towards promotion examinations and appointments. A provisional\nappointee who receives a permanent appointment to the same title immediately\nfollowing the provisional appointment shall have all time spent as a\nprovisional appointee in such title credited towards to qualifications required\nto take a promotional examination as well as eligibility for appointment from\nthe resulting eligible list, in accordance with section\n25.15\n(g)(2)\nof\nthis Part.
