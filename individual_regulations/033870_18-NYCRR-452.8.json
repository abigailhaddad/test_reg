(b) With the exception of safe home networks, which only must allow the Office access to safe homes under circumstances\nspecified in section\n454.11\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, residential programs for victims of domestic violence must allow the\n\nOffice, as specified in subdivisions (c) and (d) of this section, access to any\nbuilding or property owned, leased, rented, or directly controlled by the\nprogram and any books, papers, employees, and residents of the program in order\nto determine, and if necessary, effect compliance with applicable laws and\nregulations and with the provider's application and operating certificate. Failure to allow such access constitutes grounds for the limitation, suspension, or revocation of an operating certificate and any individual that\nintentionally refuses to allow such access to the Office shall be guilty of a\nmisdemeanor pursuant to section\n460-c\n(5)\nof the Social Services Law. (c) Inspection means the process of inquiry\nand investigation and includes periodic announced or unannounced onsite\ninvestigations, as set forth in subdivision (d) of this section, private\ninterviews with residents, review and investigation of books and records, compilation of written, photographic or other physical evidence and such\ncollateral contact as the Office deems necessary to determine compliance with\napplicable laws or regulations. Interviews with residents are voluntary. A\nresident will be interviewed only when the resident has consented to a private\ninterview. (1)\n\nAccess to personally\nidentifying information contained in books and records is permitted only upon\ninformed, written, and reasonably time-limited consent from the resident. Reasonable accommodations must be made for those who may be unable, due to\ndisability or other functional limitation, to provide consent in writing. (2)\n\nNothing in this section shall\nprohibit access to books and records containing personally identifying\ninformation when a report of child abuse or maltreatment has been\nmade. (d) The Office may\nconduct unannounced inspections: (1)\nupon the\nreceipt of any complaint involving a residential program for victims of\ndomestic violence which is related to the operation of the program; (2)\nin relation to the initial application or\na renewal of an operating certificate of any residential program for victims of\ndomestic violence; or\n(3)\nas\nfollow-up to determine whether corrective action has been taken on deficiencies\nnoted during previous inspections. (4)\nas follow-up to a report of the\noccurrence of any reportable incident to the Office including and not limited\nto: death of resident while in shelter, fire, gas leak, carbon monoxide leak, water main break and/or structural damage to the facility.

Reports of inspection may require immediate corrective\naction by the provider to protect the health, safety and welfare of\nresidents. (g) Upon receipt of the report of inspection, the provider must: (1)\ncorrect the violations in accordance with\nthe timetable for correction; or\n(2)\nin the event that correction cannot be\ncompleted within the time frame set forth in the report, obtain immediate\nwritten approval from the Office to modify the corrective action plan. A\nrequest for modification may be denied if the Office has cited conditions which\ncould endanger the health, safety, and welfare of residents. In such cases, admissions to the program will be limited or prohibited until corrective action\nis implemented. (h) Failure on the part of the provider to complete corrective action within the\ntime-table specified or approved by the Office will constitute sufficient cause\nfor the Office to limit, suspend or revoke an operating certificate.
