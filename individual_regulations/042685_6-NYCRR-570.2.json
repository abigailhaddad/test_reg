A permit issued pursuant to this Part must be obtained\nprior to the preparation of a site for, construction of, or operation of an LNG\nfacility. Every permit issued pursuant to this Part shall specify the facility\ncapacity, which shall not exceed 70,000 gallons. Facilities with valid permits\nmust be operated in conformance with the permit and any terms, limitations, and\nconditions therein. Nothing in this Part exempts a facility from compliance\nwith any other applicable State, federal, or local requirements. (b) Permit Application Contents. A complete application for a permit must conform to the format provided by the\n\nDepartment and must include, at a minimum: (1)\nthe location of the proposed facility; (2)\na description of reasonable alternative\nlocations for the proposed facility, if any, and whether the facility, if\nlocated at such alternative location(s) would be compatible with the\nsurrounding environment and with the safety of neighboring populations while\nstill meeting the needs, business purposes, or intentions of the\napplicant; (3)\nthe need for the\nproposed facility; (4)\nspecification of the tank manufacturing design standard and design capacity for\neach tank, any LNG conversion units, and any other storage device; (5)\nthe facility capacity, which shall not\nexceed 70,000 gallons; (6)\nthe\nexpected sources of natural gas or LNG for the facility; (7)\na written summary and maps showing the\nroutes to be used to supply the facility with LNG; (8)\na description of the possible\nenvironmental impacts of the proposed facility and the facility features or\nprocedures to mitigate those impacts; (9)\na statement of compliance; (10)\na report, prepared by an independent\nqualified person, that evaluates the capability and preparedness, or lack\nthereof, of fire departments in the vicinity of the proposed facility who would\nrespond to a release of LNG or fire involving LNG. If this report concludes\nthat any additional training, personnel, or equipment would be needed for local\nfire departments to effectively respond to a release or fire involving LNG, the\nreport shall detail the deficiencies and provide a detailed cost estimate and\nschedule for remedying any deficiencies; (11)\nproof of liability insurance carried by\nthe applicant which covers the proposed LNG operations; (12)\na written listing of the NFPA\nrequirements that would apply to the LNG facility in accordance with paragraph\n(d)(1) of this section and an explanation of how the LNG facility would be in\ncompliance with those requirements; (13)\nfor the proposed facility property and\nfor surrounding properties within one-half mile of the facility property\nboundaries, floodplains within areas impacted by floods equal to or greater\nthan the 100-year/base flood defined in Part 500 of this Title, the current\nzoning classifications, actual land use, and population data (from most recent\ncensus); and\n(14)\nsuch other\ninformation as the Department shall determine to be necessary to render a\ndecision about issuing a permit for the facility. (c) Permit Application Forms. (1)\n\nFacility owners must submit an\napplication for a permit on application forms provided by the Department unless\nan alternative means of application is approved by the Department.
