The court shall provide notice of all such\ntechnical failures on the NYSCEF site. When e-filing is hindered by a technical\nfailure, a party may file with the court in hard copy. With the exception of\ndeadlines that by law cannot be extended, the time for filing of any paper that\nis delayed due to the technical failure as defined herein shall be extended for\none day for each day in which such technical failure occurs, unless otherwise\nordered by the court. (2)\n\nIf the e-filing or e-service does not\noccur or is prevented because of any of the following, the court may upon\nsatisfactory proof enter an order permitting the document to be filed nunc pro\ntunc to the date it was first attempted to be sent electronically or extending\nthe date for filing or service of the paper: an error in the transmission of\nthe document to NYSCEF or served party which was unknown to the sending party; the party was erroneously excluded from the service list; or other technical\nproblems experienced by the e-filer, including problems with the filer's\nequipment or Internet connection.
