  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.239 - Stress relieving\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as\nprovided in subdivision (f) of this section, each weld on carbon steel that has\na carbon content in excess of 0.32 percent (heat analysis) or a carbon\nequivalent (C + 1/4 Mn) in excess of 0.65 percent (heat analysis) must be\nstress relieved as prescribed in section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure\n\nVessel Code (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title). (b) Except as provided in subdivision (f) of\nthis section, each weld on carbon steel that has a carbon content of less than\n0.32 percent (heat analysis) or a carbon equivalent (C + 1/4 Mn) of less than\n0.65 percent (heat analysis) must be thermally stress relieved when conditions\nexist that would cause the weld to cool at a rate detrimental to the quality of\nthe weld. (c) Except as provided in\nsubdivision (f) of this section, each weld on carbon steel pipe with a wall\nthickness of more than 11/4 inches (32 millimeters) must be stress\nrelieved. (d) When a weld connects\npipe or components that are of different thickness, the wall thickness to be\nused in determining whether stress relieving is required under this section is: (1)\nin the case of pipe connections, the\nthicker of the two pipes joined; or\n(2)\nin the case of branch connections, slip-on flanges, or socket weld fittings, the thickness of the pipe run or\nheader. (e) Each weld of\ndifferent materials must be stress relieved, if either material requires stress\nrelieving under this section. (f) Notwithstanding subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of this section, stress relieving\nis not required for the following: (1)\na\nfillet or groove weld one-half inch (13 millimeters), or less, in size (leg)\nthat attaches a connection two inches (51 millimeters), or less, in diameter; or\n(2)\na fillet or groove weld\nthree-eighths inch (9.5 millimeters), or less, in groove size that attaches a\nsupporting member or other nonpressure attachment. (g) Stress relieving required by this section\nmust be performed at a temperature of at least 1,100° F (593° C) for\ncarbon steels and at least 1,200° F (649° C) for ferritic alloy steels. When stress relieving a weld between steel materials with different stress\nrelieving temperatures, the higher temperature must be used. (h) When stress relieving, the temperature\nmust be monitored to ensure that a uniform temperature is maintained and that\nthe proper stress relieving cycle is accomplished. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.239\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
