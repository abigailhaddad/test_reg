Tit. 1 § 111.14 - Seed failing to meet certification standards for superior, select, or standard seed\n\nState Regulations\n\nIt is recognized that certified tree seed should meet\nhigh standards in mechanical purity, germination, genetic quality, and freedom\nfrom damage by insects or disease. However, certain lots of seed may fail to\nmeet certification standards for superior, select or standard seed, and yet may\nappropriately be certified. Such seed may be certified under conditions jointly\nprescribed by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets, the Dean of the\n\nState University College of Forestry, and the certifying agency. Seed so\ncertified shall be tagged \"Source seed\" with a special certification tag which\nshall indicate the respect or respects in which the seed to which it is\nattached fails to meet certification standards for superior, select or standard\nseed. No seed shall be certified under this provision under conditions which\nwill be injurious to the reputation of certified tree seed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n111.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
