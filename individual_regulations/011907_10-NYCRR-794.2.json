Tit. 10 § 794.2 - Contracts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ngoverning authority may enter into contracts with appropriate qualified\nindividuals, organizations, agencies and/or facilities, when necessary, to\nprovide for those services required by patients/families when the hospice\nitself does not have sufficient staff or necessary equipment available to\nrender such services directly. (1)\n\nSuch\ncontracts shall meet all applicable State and Federal requirements and shall\nspecify: (i) each party's responsibilities, functions, objectives, financial arrangements and charges, including\nresponsibility for supervision; (ii)\nthat personnel meet the personnel\nrequirements as set forth in section\n794.3\nof this Part, which can be\nverified by written documented evidence accessible to the hospice or department\non request; (iii)\nthat services\nprovided by contract to the patient shall be authorized by the hospice in\naccordance with the plan of care developed by the hospice and that the contract\nprovider agrees to abide by the patient care policies established by the\nhospice for its patients; (iv)\nthat\nthe contracting provider agrees to participate in patient/family care planning\nconferences as requested by the hospice; (v) that contracting providers who are\nlicensed professionals agree to participate in: (a) the coordination of all aspects of the\npatient's hospice care, including ongoing interdisciplinary comprehensive\nassessments, developing and evaluating the plan of care, and contributing to\npatient and family counseling and education; (b) the hospice's quality assessment and\nperformance improvement program; and\n(c) hospice sponsored in-service\ntraining. (vi)\nany\nprovisions made for indemnification between the hospice and contracting\nproviders; and\n(vii)\nthe following\nterms and conditions: \"Notwithstanding any other provision in this contract, the hospice remains responsible for (a) ensuring that any service provided\npursuant to this contract complies with all pertinent provisions of Federal, State and local statutes, rules and regulations; (b) planning, coordinating and\nensuring the quality of all services provided; and (c) ensuring adherence to\nthe plan of care established for patients.\"\n(2)\n\nWhen a contract is with a licensed\nmedical facility or certified home health agency, the service provided must be\nin compliance with the applicable provisions of article 28 or 36 of the Public\n\nHealth Law, respectively, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated\nthereunder.

(3)\n\nWhen a contract is between the hospice\nand a skilled nursing facility (SNF)/intermediate care facility (ICF) to\nprovide hospice services to residents of the SNF/ICF, the provisions of section\n794.8\nof this Part related to\ncontracts shall also apply. (b) Except when a management contract has\nbeen approved pursuant to this section, the governing authority may not\ndelegate its responsibility for the operation of the hospice to another\norganization, a parent or subsidiary corporation or through a managing\nauthority contract.

The description shall clearly reflect\nretention by the governing authority of ongoing responsibility for statutory\nand regulatory compliance; (ii)\na\nprovision that clearly recognizes that the responsibilities of the hospice's\ngoverning authority are in no way obviated by entering into the management\ncontract, and that any powers not specifically delegated to the managing\nauthority through the provisions of the contract remain with the governing\nauthority; (iii)\na clear\nacknowledgment of the authority of the commissioner to void the contract\npursuant to paragraph (9) of this subdivision; (iv)\na plan for assuring maintenance of the\nfiscal stability, the level of service provided and the quality of care\nrendered by the hospice during the term of the management contract; (v) an acknowledgment that the costs of the\ncontract are subject to all applicable provisions of Part 86 of this\n\nTitle; (vi)\na requirement that the\nreports described in paragraph (10) of this subdivision will be provided to the\ndepartment and to the governing authority annually for the term of the\nmanagement contract; (vii)\nan\nexpress representation that any management contract approved by the\ncommissioner is the sole agreement between the managing authority and the\ngoverning authority for the purpose of managing the day-to-day operation of the\nhospice or any portion thereof, and that any amendments or revisions to the\nmanagement contract shall be effective only with the prior written consent of\nthe commissioner; and\n(viii)\na\nprovision that includes the terms of paragraph (8) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nNo\nmanagement contract shall be approved if the governing authority does not\nretain sufficient authority and control to discharge its responsibility as the\ncertified operator. The following elements of control shall not be delegated to\na managing authority: (i) direct independent\nauthority to hire or fire the administrator; (ii)\nindependent control of the books and\nrecords; (iii)\nauthority over the\ndisposition of assets and the authority to incur on behalf of the hospice\nliabilities not normally associated with the day-to-day operation of a hospice; and\n(iv)\nindependent adoption of\npolicies affecting the delivery of health care services. (4)\n\nIn addition to a proposed written\ncontract complying with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, a\ngoverning authority seeking to enter into a management contract shall submit to\nthe department, at least 60 days prior to the intended effective date, unless a\nshorter period is approved by the commissioner due to extraordinary\ncircumstances, the following: (i) documentation indicating that the proposed managing authority holds all\nnecessary approvals to do business in New York State; (ii)\ndocumentation of the goals and\nobjectives of the management contract, including a mechanism for periodic\nevaluation of the effectiveness of the arrangement in meeting these goals and\nobjectives; (iii)\nevidence of the\nmanaging authority's financial stability; (iv)\ninformation necessary to determine that\nthe character and competence of the proposed managing authority, and its\nprincipals, officers and directors, are satisfactory, including evidence that\nall agencies or health care facilities managed or operated, in or outside of\n\nNew York State, have provided a high level of care; and\n(v) evidence that it is financially feasible\nfor the hospice to enter into the proposed management contract, recognizing\nthat the costs of the contract are subject to all applicable provisions of Part\n86 of this Title. (5)\n\nDuring the period between a hospice's submission of a request for approval of a\nmanagement contract and disposition of that request, a hospice may not enter\ninto any arrangement for management contract services other than a written\ninterim consultative agreement with the proposed managing authority. Any\ninterim agreement shall reflect consistency with the provisions of this\nsection, and shall be submitted to the department no later than five days after\nits effective date. (6)\n\nThe term of\na management contract shall be limited to three years and may be renewed only\nwhen authorized by the commissioner, provided compliance with this section and\nthe following provisions can be demonstrated: (i) that the goals and objectives of the\ncontract have been met within specified timeframes; (ii)\nthat the quality of care provided by the\nhospice during the term of the contract has been maintained or has improved; and\n(iii)\nthat the reporting\nrequirements contained in paragraph (10) of this subdivision have been\nmet.

In such event, the hospice shall notify the department in writing at the time\nthe managing authority is notified. The hospice's governing authority shall\nprovide a plan for the operation of the hospice subsequent to the discharge, to\nbe submitted with the notification to the department. (9)\nA management contract shall terminate and\nbe deemed cancelled, without financial penalty to the governing authority, not\nmore than 60 days after notification to the parties by the department of a\ndetermination that the management of the hospice is so deficient that the\nhealth and safety of patients would be threatened by continuation of the\ncontract. (10)\n\nEach managing\nauthority shall submit annual reports to the department and the governing\nauthority providing measurements of hospice performance in the following areas: (i) financial operations, including a balance\nsheet, any change in financial position, and a statement of revenues and\nexpenses sufficient to determine liquidity, working capital, net operating\nmargin and age, extent and type of payables and receivables; (ii)\npersonnel; and\n(iii)\nservices delivered.
