  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 236.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose\nof this Part, the general definitions of Part 200 of this Title\napply. (b) For the purpose of this\n\nPart, the following definitions also apply: (1)\nCAS number. Chemical Abstracts Service\nregistration number assigned to specific chemicals, isomers, or mixtures of\nchemicals. (2)\n\nComponent. Any piece\nof process unit equipment which has the potential to leak a chemical listed in\nsection\n236.8, table 1, of this Part when\nmonitored as prescribed by section\n236.7\nof this Part. These include, but are not limited to: pumps, compressors, valves, open- ended pipes, and\npressure relief devices. Excluded from these are valves which are not\nexternally operated. (3)\n\nDepartment. The New York State Department of Environmental\n\nConservation. (4)\n\nDouble\nblock-and-bleed system. Two block valves connected in series with a bleed valve\nor line that can vent the line between the two block valves. (5)\n\nInitial attempt to repair. To take rapid\naction to repair leaks. These include, but are not limited to: tightening or\nreplacing bonnet bolts, tightening packing bolts or glands, or injecting\nlubricant into lubricated packing. (6)\n\nIn gas/vapor service. Any equipment which\nprocesses, transfers, or contains a chemical or mixture of chemicals in the\ngaseous phase having a concentration greater than 10 percent by weight of the\nchemicals listed in section\n236.8, table 1, of this\n\nPart. (7)\n\nIn heavy liquid service. Any equipment which processes, transfers, or contains a fluid and is not in\ngas/vapor or light liquid service. (8)\n\nIn light liquid service. Any equipment\nwhich processes, transfers, or contains a fluid having a vapor pressure greater\nthan 0.3 kilopascals at 20° C (0.0427 psia at 68° F) and having a concentration\ngreater than 10 percent by weight of the chemicals listed in section\n236.8, table 1, of this\n\nPart. (9)\n\nIn vacuum service. Equipment operating at an internal pressure at least 5 kilopascals (0.712 psia)\nbelow ambient pressure. (10)\n\nLeak. The emission of a chemical listed in section\n236.8, table 1, of this Part at a\nconcentration greater than or equal to 10,000 parts per million by volume\n(ppmv) as shown by monitoring. An indication of liquids dripping shall also be\nconsidered a leak. (11)\n\nLiquids\ndripping. Any visible leakage from a seal or opening including, but not limited\nto: dripping, spraying, misting, clouding, or ice formation. (12)\n\nOpen-ended valve or line. Any valve\nhaving one side of the valve seat in contact with the process fluid and one\nside open to the atmosphere either directly or through open piping. Pressure\nrelief valves are an exception to this definition. (13)\n\nProcess unit. Components assembled to\nproduce, as an intermediate or final product, one or more of the chemicals\nlisted in section\n236.8, table 1, of this\n\nPart. (14)\n\nProcess unit shutdown. A\nscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from all\nor part of a process unit. Process unit shutdowns do not include unscheduled\nwork practice or operational procedures that stop production from all or part\nof a process unit for less than 24 hours, or the use of spare equipment or a\ntechnically feasible bypass without stopping production. (15)\n\nRepair. To adjust or otherwise alter a\ncomponent to eliminate a leak. (16)\n\nSynthetic organic chemical manufacturing facility. A facility which\nmanufactures, as an intermediate or final product, one or more of the synthetic\norganic chemicals, polymers and resins listed in section\n236.8, table 1, of this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n236.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
