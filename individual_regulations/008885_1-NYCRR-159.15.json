  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 159.15 - Infractions and Violations\n\nState Regulations\n\nGrowers failing to adhere to the requirements set forth in\nthis Part shall be subject to penalties and other enforcement action, including\nsuspension and license termination, depending on the number and extent of the\ninfractions or violations that have occurred. The failure to comply with the\n\nPart's requirements fall into three categories, as follows: (a) Infractions. Infractions occur when a\ngrower fails to follow any of the requirements of this Part, and which are not\nmore specifically addressed in paragraphs (b) and (c) herein. (i) The Department shall advise growers of\ninfractions observed by its inspector by delivery of an inspection report\nlisting the infractions observed or by delivery of a notice of\ninfraction. (ii)\n\nThe Department\nshall establish a date by which the infraction shall be corrected. (iii)\nA grower shall have an opportunity to\nbe heard concerning any noticed infraction with respect to which the Department\ntakes enforcement action. (iv)\n\nAt\nthe Department's discretion, a grower may be required to enter into a\ncompliance agreement to ensure future compliance. (b) Negligent violations. Negligent\nviolations occur when a grower fails to exercise the level of care that a\nreasonably prudent person would exercise in complying with the requirements set\nforth in this Part. (i) The following actions\nfall within the category of negligent violations: (1)\n\nGrowing and handling of hemp without a\nvalid license; or\n(2)\n\nGrowing and\nhandling hemp at sites and locations not approved under the grower's license; or\n(3)\n\nProducing cannabis exceeding\nthe acceptable hemp THC level, provided that the regulatory sample of the\ncannabis does not have a total THC concentration of more than 1.0 percent on a\ndry weight basis, and the grower can demonstrate that it has made reasonable\nefforts to grow compliant hemp; or\n(4)\n\nFailing to timely dispose or otherwise\nhandle all lots of plants determined to have a more than the accepted hemp THC\nlevel in a manner consistent with this Part or the guidance adopted pursuant to\nthis Part; or\n(5)\n\nHarvesting hemp\nprior to the collection of a regulatory pre-harvest sample by a Department\ninspector or Department-certified sampling agent or prior to receiving written\napproval to harvest from the Department; or\n(6)\n\nHarvesting hemp more than 30 days after\nthe regulatory sampling date; or\n(7)\n\nCommingling lots of harvested plant\nmaterial prior to the time that the sampled lots are tested and determined not\nto exceed the accepted hemp THC level; or\n(8)\n\nFailing to segregate and store the plant\nmaterial from each lot subject to regulatory sampling at an approved site or\nsuch other location storage or changing its location from the location\nauthorized by the Department until regulatory testing results demonstrate that\nthe plant material does not exceed the accepted hemp THC level. (ii)\n\nFor each negligent violation, the Department shall issue a Notice of Violation, advising the grower of the\nnegligent violation and providing a deadline by which the violation shall be\ncorrected. (iii)\n\nThe issuance of a\n\nNotice of Violation may result in an assessment of a penalty or other\nenforcement action. (iv)\nA grower\nmay contest the noticed violation within 15 days of the date of the notice, and\nshall be provided with an opportunity to be heard with respect to the noticed\nviolation. (v) Corrective action\nfor negligent violations. (1)\n\nUnless the\ngrower contests the violation, within 20 days of the date of the notice, the\ngrower shall submit a corrective action plan for the Department's approval, which, at a minimum, shall include: (A)\nA\nreasonable date by which the negligent violation shall be corrected; and\n(B)\n\nThe actions to be taken by\nthe grower to correct the violation and to ensure future compliance with the\nrequirements that were not met; and\n(C)\nA schedule for the submission of\nquarterly reports for a period of two years, which reports will advise the\n\nDepartment of the grower's compliance with its corrective action\nplan. (2)\n\nThe Department\nshall advise the grower whether the proposed plan is approved as submitted or\nif any changes or additional requirements are needed for an acceptable\nplan. (3)\n\nPursuant to\n7 U.S.C. 1639p(e)(2)(C), a grower\nwith an approved plan shall not, as a result of the negligent violation, be\nsubject to any criminal enforcement action by Federal or State\ngovernment. (4)\n\nThe State may\nconduct inspections to determine if the corrective action plan has been\nimplemented as submitted. (5)\n\nIf a\nsubsequent violation occurs while a corrective action plan is in place, a new\ncorrective action plan must be submitted with a heightened level of quality\ncontrol, staff training, and quantifiable action measures. (vi)\nA grower that negligently violates the\nrequirements of this Part three times during a 5-year period shall be\nineligible to produce hemp for a period of 5 years beginning as of the date of\nthe third violation. (c) Culpable Violation. A grower, with a culpable mental state greater than\nnegligence, that: (1)\ngrows or cultivates\nhemp with a total THC level in excess of 1 percent on a dry weight basis; (2)\nhandles such non-compliant hemp\nfor a purpose other than ensuring its destruction pursuant to the requirements\nof this Part; 3) and/or introduces such non-compliant hemp into the stream of\ncommerce, commits a culpable violation under this Part. (i) When the Department has reason to believe\nthat a grower has committed a culpable violation, it shall issue a Notice of\n\nViolation, and undertake such other enforcement action it deems\nappropriate. (ii)\nA grower may\ncontest the noticed violation within 15 days of the date of the notice and\nshall be provided with an opportunity to be heard with respect to the noticed\nviolation. (iii)\n\nIf the Department\ndetermines that a grower has committed a culpable violation, the Department\nshall immediately report the grower to the U.S. Attorney General and the chief\nlaw enforcement officer of the State.
