Temporary use beds shall be included in a facility's certified\ncapacity (see glossary, section\n686.99\nof this Part) and shall be\nused for respite, trial visits, therapeutic stays and emergency housing. For\nall purposes but trial visits, it is expected that the person will return to\nhis or her permanent residence following the stay and therefore shall not be\nsubject to the facility's admission process; a person who is on a trial visit\nwhich results in acceptance for permanent residency shall be admitted\nsubsequent to that acceptance. Temporary use beds shall be used in accordance\nwith the following: (i) To offer respite (see\nglossary, section\n686.99\nof this Part) to a primary\ncaregiver who is either a family member, a legal guardian, a correspondent, or\na family care provider. (a) Overnight Respite\nmay be provided for no more than forty-two (42) days in a one-hundred-eighty\n(180) day period. After the forty-two (42) days, any continued overnight\nbilling will be limited to the regional average daily rate paid for Supervised\nIRA services. (b) In providing\nrespite, the facility shall assume the daily responsibilities of the primary\ncaregiver, limited to: (1)\nroom and\nboard; (2)\n24-hour\nsupervision; (3)\nhealth and\nself-care services including overseeing routine medical care and managing any\nmedical emergency; and\n(4)\ncoordination of the established treatment program.

(a) For any given person, at a\ngiven site, the number of trial visit days shall not exceed seven in a\ncontinuous six-month period. (b) During a trial visit the facility shall provide room, board, necessary\nsupervision and those services required to assess the person's appropriateness\nfor admission to the residence. (iii)\n\nFor a therapeutic stay provided to meet\na person's need for short-term therapeutic programming. (a) A therapeutic stay shall be provided only\nto those persons who reside in and are on leave from either a family care home, a supportive community residence, or another supervised community residence; or\nto persons who reside with family, or who live independently. (b) For any given person, at a given site, a\ntherapeutic stay shall not exceed 30 consecutive days. (c) During a therapeutic stay, the facility\nshall provide room, board, necessary supervision and those services necessary\nto meet the person's needs and conform with the plan of services developed and\nmonitored by the person's case manager. (iv)\n\nFor emergency housing provided to a\nperson who requires alternate housing due to a natural disaster which rendered\nthe person's existing residence temporarily uninhabitable\n(\ne.g., due to fire, extended power failure, etc.), due to\nabandonment by the person's primary caregiver, or a documented inability of the\nprimary caregiver to continue to serve the person. (a) Emergency housing shall be provided only\nto those persons who reside in a family care home, a supportive community\nresidence, another supervised community residence, with family, or who live\nindependently.

(2)\nA supervised community residence or\nindividualized residential alternative (see section\n686.16\nof this Part) of four beds\nor more, may use a vacant certified bed (other than a bed designated as a\ntemporary use bed) for respite, trial visits, therapeutic stays or emergency\nhousing in accordance with subparagraphs (1)(i)-(iv) of this subdivision. Those\npersons who occupy a vacant certified bed for short-term purposes shall not be\nsubject to the facility's admission process; a person who is on a trial visit\nwhich results in acceptance for permanent residency shall be admitted\nsubsequent to that acceptance. Utilization of a vacant, certified bed for such\ntemporary purposes shall: (i) Occur, if and\nonly if, there is no waiting list for admission to the facility. Exceptions\nshall be made for a trial visit of a person on the waiting list or for\nprovision of emergency housing. (ii)\n\nBe limited to 90 days. Where a vacant, certified bed has either been used for short- term purposes only or remained\nvacant throughout a 90-day period, it shall be converted to a temporary use bed\non the facility's operating certificate unless there are plans: (a) for immediate use of the bed by an\nadmitted individual; or\n(b) to\nremove the bed from the facility's certified capacity.

That\nis, the evacuation capability of the person, when considered with the\nevacuation capability classification of the entire facility, shall not result\nin a change in category without the facility making the necessary adjustments\nto maintain conformance with the facility's existing classification prior to\nadmitting the person. (ii)\n\nIn a\nnon-chapter 32 or 33 facility, the person in question shall be determined to be\nable to evacuate the facility without assistance within 2.5 minutes in a\nsupervised community residence or 3.0 minutes (with assistance, when necessary)\nin an individualized residential alternative.
