  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 366.6 - Budgeting\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following general provisions apply: (a) A participant is no longer eligible for\nCAP when such individual is not eligible for benefits for four consecutive\nmonths. (b) Once the CAP benefit\nhas been determined for a payment quarter, no recalculation of the CAP benefit\nmay be made during that payment quarter if the family experiences an increase\nor decrease in income. This provision does not apply to nonfinancial changes\nwhich are not related to income which impact the CAP benefit. (c) CAP participants are not eligible to\nreceive the child support pass-through provided for in section\n352.15\nof this Title. However, when a family's monthly CAP benefit (including any special allowances and\nrecoupment amounts) is less than the amount of current child support received\nby the agency in the same month, the district must provide the family with the\ndifference. This process, known as support reconciliation, must be completed by\nthe district when each quarterly report is received. Such payments are not\nconsidered income for CAP. (d) The\npublic assistance lump sum provision of section\n352.29\n(h) of this\n\nTitle does not apply to CAP. CAP households are allowed to retain lump sums\nthat are less than one quarter of the 1989 poverty level without impacting\ntheir CAP eligibility. When a member of the CAP household receives a lump sum\nwhich is more than one quarter of the 1989 poverty level, the household is\nineligible for public assistance for the number of CAP payment quarters which\nequals the amount of the lump sum divided by the quarterly poverty\nlevel. (e) Grandparent and\nstepparent deeming must be applied in determining CAP eligibility and benefit\namount when a grandparent or stepparent is legally responsible for a CAP filing\nunit member but is not drawn into the CAP filing unit. CAP stepparent and\ngrandparent deeming follow the same procedures used for public assistance found\nat section\n352.14\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Title for the deeming of income, except that CAP deeming substitutes the\n1989 monthly poverty level for the work disregard found at section\n352.14\n(a)(3)(i)\nof this Title and the standard of need disregard found at section\n352.14\n(a)(3)(ii)\nof this Title. (f) The cooperative\nbudgeting procedures found at section\n352.32\n(e) of this\n\nTitle do not apply when a CAP filing unit resides in the same home with a\npublic assistance filing unit. (g) The undue hardship reduction procedures found at section\n352.31\n(d)(2)\nof\nthis Title do not apply to CAP. (h) The gross income limits found at section\n352.18\nof this Title do not apply\nto CAP. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n366.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
