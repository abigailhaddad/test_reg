  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 607.4 - Standards and practices applicable to the construction and environmental management of subsurface telephone facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section covers the standards and\npractices which the utilities are expected to follow to minimize adverse\nenvironmental impacts associated with the construction of subsurface telephone\nfacilities under Parts 604 and 608 of this Title. In this section, any\nreference to subsurface telephone facilities does not include poles and\nanchors. (b) The standards and\npractices are not intended to supersede the jurisdiction of any Federal, State\nor municipal agency that has permitting or other regulatory requirements\nintended to protect environmental resources or values which may be adversely\naffected by the installation of subsurface telephone facilities. To accomplish\nthe objectives set forth in this section, each utility shall stay in contact\nwith directly affected land owners and governmental agencies having\njurisdiction. (c) Each utility\nshall use its best efforts to avoid or minimize to the maximum extent\npracticable, any adverse environmental effects associated with the construction\n(including clearing and site-restoration activities) of subsurface telephone\nfacilities, by: (1)\nlimiting clearing of\ntrees, shrubs and landscaped areas in accordance with safe construction, operating and maintenance practices; (2)\nminimizing off R/W impacts by confining\nconstruction activities and access to the smallest areas possible, consistent\nwith safe and efficient construction and operation practices; (3)\nscheduling construction for those times\nthat would minimize damage or disruption to sensitive resources and\nagricultural production activities (except as otherwise agreed to by the\nlandowner); (4)\nminimizing\ndisturbances to sensitive resources such as streams, wetlands or rare, threatened or endangered species habitats by limiting machinery movement in or\nnear such resources during construction and throughout the life of the\nfacility; (5)\nselecting\nconstruction and maintenance equipment that minimizes damage to and disruption\nof soils; (6)\nminimizing topsoil\ndamage and soil erosion due to grading and other soil-scarifying activities by\npromptly stabilizing disturbed soil and employing soil separation as\nappropriate, and thereby preventing erosion and siltation and minimizing\ncompaction; and\n(7)\nminimizing\ntraffic disruption when construction vehicles travel along or cross R/W by\nproviding appropriate traffic controls. (d) The clearing, construction and site\nrestoration practices set forth in the following sections shall be observed by\neach utility where applicable: (1)\n\nEach\nutility shall take care to prevent or minimize the grading or piling of soil\noff the R/W, particularly in cultivated land(s) and near streams and\nwetlands. (2)\n\nBefore constructing a\nnew access road, each utility shall give preference to using existing access to\nthe R/W; however, where steep slopes (over 20 percent) are encountered along\nthe R/W or where soils, which would not support construction equipment or would\nresult in extensive rutting or compaction, are encountered, the construction of\neither a temporary or permanent off R/W access road shall be considered. However, the placement of permanent access roads in cultivated land shall be\navoided wherever possible, unless such roads are requested or agreed to by the\nlandowner or farm operator. (3)\n\nEach utility shall endeavor to complete stream crossings in the shortest amount\nof time, with the least amount of adverse environmental impact. (4)\n\nWhere necessary each utility shall\nproperly install temporary drainage and erosion control devices during clearing\nand grading operations, appropriately maintain them during construction and\nincorporate them, where necessary, into final grading operations. (5)\n\nBefore grading and trenching, each\nutility shall make an on-site effort to verify the location of any buried gas\nlines, water lines, sewer lines, drainage tiles or similar facilities which may\nbe encountered. All such facilities removed, cut, broken or otherwise damaged\nduring facility construction shall be restored or replaced to at least their\npreexisting condition, unless the affected property owner declines such\nrestoration or replacement or where such facilities would interfere with the\nsafe and efficient operation and maintenance of the subsurface telephone\nfacilities. (6)\n\nAt the project\nplanning stage, before initiating grading or trenching operations in cultivated\nland on land used in agricultural production (as demonstrated by the affected\nfarm operator), each utility shall discuss with such farm operator and the\nappropriate county soil and water conservation district the soil\ncharacteristics of the project area, drainage, irrigation, cultivation and\nother land management installations and practices, flood control, the proposed\ndepth-of-cover above the facility and the appropriateness of topsoil\nsegregation. In cultivated land, all cable shall be installed with a minimum 24\ninches of cover. However, the farm operator may require a depth-of-cover\ngreater than 24 inches as a condition of permitting a right-of-way across his\nor her land where necessary to safely accommodate such practices and projects. In such cases, where practicable, the depth-of-cover shall be included in the\neasement recorded in the county records office. All such decisions shall take\ninto account the recommended practices and standards of the United States\n\nDepartment of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, as noted in the farm\noperator's farm conservation plan on file with the county soil and water\nconservation district. The farm operator shall not be liable for any damage to\nthe buried cable which occurs as a result of land fitting activities including, but not limited to, plowing, subsoiling and disking. Cable plow installation\nmay be used in cultivated land unless the land within the area of construction\ncontains subsurface drain lines. In those cases open trenching shall be used\nunless the farm operator agrees to cable plow installation. A generic plan and\nprocedure for the repair of drain lines removed, cut, broken or damaged by\neither method of installation shall be developed by the utility with the soil\nconservation service and the New York State Department of Agriculture and\n\nMarkets showing the method(s) for shouldering of the tile drain line repair\ninto the undisturbed trench wall, the support of the repair tile and the\nmaintenance of the drain line's gravity flow. In all cases of removal, cutting, breakage or damage of drain lines during construction by the utility, repairs\nshall be undertaken at the utility's expense. (7)\n\nWhere adverse effects to significant\nplantings such as ornamental shrubs and trees, as well as visual screens, cannot be avoided during construction, such plants shall be carefully removed\nand planted in a temporary location and then be returned as close as possible\nto their original location following back-filling. If such plants must be\nremoved and are destroyed, they shall be replaced with species and varieties as\nclose as possible in height, diameter and grade to those removed. Exceptions\nwould be where such vegetation would interfere with the operation and\nmaintenance of the facility, the construction is done at the request of the\naffected landowner, or where the affected landowner and the utility agree\notherwise. If the affected property has been the subject of Federal, State or\nlocal agency review jurisdiction, the involved Federal, State or local agency\nmust also agree to the extent the resulting disturbance affects a condition of\na previously issued permit or other approval. Transplanting and plant\nreplacement shall be done consistent with established horticultural\npractices. (8)\n\nIn areas where\nlivestock are confined or farm equipment is operating, all trenches which will\nremain open overnight or on nonworking days shall be temporarily fenced or\nbarricaded, unless the trench shoring or sheeting material extends at least 40\ninches above the working surface. Where reasonably determined necessary by the\naffected landowner or farm operator, temporary access should be constructed to\npermit persons, vehicles and livestock to cross safely from one side of the\ntrench to the other. (9)\n\nShould\ndewatering of the trench become necessary, all water shall be filtered and\ndissipated through appropriate filter material or discharged onto vegetated or\ngraveled areas, to prevent stream siltation and sedimentation and soil erosion. No such water shall be discharged onto cultivated land in the cropping season\nor directly into regulated streams, ponds or wetlands. If cultivated land\nreceives discharges outside the cropping season, measures shall be applied to\ndissipate the water to prevent soil erosion. (10)\n\nEngine-powered construction equipment\nshall be properly muffled and maintained to avoid producing excessive noise. Such equipment shall not be permitted to idle unnecessarily near noise\nsensitive uses. Near such uses, the quietest equipment which is readily\navailable to each utility and appropriate for the task shall be employed. If\nblasting is necessary, explosive charges shall be controlled to limit the sound\npressure level to 127 dB. (11)\n\nWhenever artifacts or relics which appear to have historic value are uncovered\nduring construction, work shall be stopped immediately at the site of impact\nand the State Historic Preservation Office shall be notified. Work elsewhere\nmay continue. Construction at the impact site shall not be resumed until the\n\nState Historic Preservation Office or its designated representative determines\nthe significance of the find and, if required, develops a plan to salvage or\nprotect such resource. If prompt clarification of the situation by such\nofficials is not forthcoming or if complications arise, the commission shall be\nnotified immediately. (12)\n\nIn\nrestoring the R/W each utility shall: (i) recycle all waste material or dispose of it in accordance with governing rules\nand regulations; (ii)\ngrade the\nentire disturbed R/W to restore it to original grade and contour, unless\nchanges made to grade and contour are agreed to by the landowner; (iii)\ncontact the county soil and water\nconservation district for the most appropriate seed mix and application rates\nin the construction area; (iv)\nutilize the most appropriate seed mix and application rate, giving\nconsideration to compatibility with undisturbed areas of the R/W and the\nsurrounding land and consistent with erosion, wildlife and other environmental\nconcerns; (v) determine the\nsite-specific seed mix to be applied on active agriculture land in consultation\nwith the affected farm operator; (vi)\nby the end of the workweek in which\nconstruction commences, apply mulch (and seed, if no further disturbance is\nplanned) on all disturbed sites at least 20 feet from all streams and\nwetlands; (vii)\nstabilize all cut\nand fill banks by employing the most appropriate erosion control devices and\ntechniques; (viii)\ncomplete stream\nbank restoration as soon as practicable after the stream crossing installation\nis completed. If seasonal conditions do not permit final restoration, temporary\nrestoration measures shall be undertaken, with final restoration measures to\nfollow as soon as practicable thereafter; and, (ix)\nrepair or replace (and leave in a\ncondition equivalent to or better than, the preexisting) all existing\ninstallations or improvements, for example, lawns, fences, walls, curbs, sidewalks, culverts, mailboxes, gates, tiles, drainage ditches, waterways, ponds which are disturbed, damaged or destroyed during construction, unless\nprevious arrangements with landowners or farm operators dictate\notherwise. (e) Each utility shall ensure that the\nconstruction supervisor who is on the job, appropriately applies the foregoing\nstandards and practices. The supervisor shall also have authority to stop any\nwork that is inconsistent with the intent of this section and to direct\nappropriate remedial action. Also the supervisor shall obtain a competent\nspecialist's advice on how to deal with any sensitive resources\nencountered. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
