  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 37.1 - Authorization\n\nState Regulations\n\nSubject to the limitations contained in section\n37.2\nof this Part, and the prior\nreview by the Department, a bank or trust company may make real estate equity\ninvestments in community development projects provided that any such project\nprimarily serves a public purpose. A project will be deemed to serve a public\npurpose if it promotes housing and economic revitalization or development in\nlow and moderate income areas and directly benefits low and moderate income\nresidents or small businesses. In determining whether the project primarily\nserves a public purpose, consideration shall also be given as to whether the\nproject primarily benefits the particular bank's local service area, and\nwhether there is significant community involvement, including the extent to\nwhich community groups are involved in project implementation, and the extent\nof community and public support for the project. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n37.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
