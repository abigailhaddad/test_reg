The assigned judge, in his or her discretion or at the request of\na party, thereafter may determine that any motion be orally argued and may fix\na time for oral argument. A party requesting oral argument shall set forth such\nrequest in its notice of motion or in its order to show cause or on the first\npage of the answering papers, as the case may be. Where all parties to a motion\nrequest oral argument, oral argument shall be granted unless the court shall\ndetermine it to be unnecessary. Where a motion is brought on by order to show\ncause, the court may set forth in the order that oral argument is required on\nthe return date of the motion. (e) (1)\n\nStipulations of adjournment of the\nreturn date made by the parties shall be in writing and shall be submitted to\nthe assigned judge. Such stipulation shall be effective unless the court\notherwise directs. No more than three stipulated adjournments for an aggregate\nperiod of 60 days shall be submitted without prior permission of the\ncourt. (2)\n\nAbsent\nagreement by the parties, a request by any party for an adjournment shall be\nsubmitted in writing, upon notice to the other party, to the assigned judge on\nor before the return date. The court will notify the requesting party whether\nthe adjournment has been granted. (f) Where the motion relates to\ndisclosure or to a bill of particulars, and a preliminary conference has not\nbeen held, the court shall notify all parties of a scheduled date to appear for\na preliminary conference, which shall be not more than 45 days from the return\ndate of the motion unless the court orders otherwise, and a form of a\nstipulation and order, prescribed by the Chief Administrator of the Courts, shall be made available which the parties may sign, agreeing to a timetable\nwhich shall provide for completion of disclosure within 12 months, and for a\nresolution of any other issues raised by the motion. If all parties sign the\nform and return it to the court before the return date of the motion, such form\nshall be \"so ordered\" by the court, and the motion shall be deemed withdrawn. If such stipulation is not returned by all parties, the conference shall be\nheld on the assigned date. Issues raised by the motion and not resolved at the\nconference shall be determined by the court. (g) Unless the circumstances require\nsettlement of an order, a judge shall incorporate into the decision an order\neffecting the relief specified in the decision.

This open motion report may be used by the\njustice to assist in the preparation of his or her official quarterly\nreport. (2)\n\nSince\nmotions are decided on a daily basis and further submissions may be received on\na pending motion, the only report that shall be considered current is the\nofficial quarterly report submitted by the particular justice.
