  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 232-3.3 - Equipment standards and specifications\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Specific equipment standards and\nemission control specifications. (1)\n\nPrimary control systems. Water cooled condensers and refrigerated condensers\ninstalled on the dry cleaning machines specified in subdivision (b) of this\nsection must meet the following requirements: (i) Water cooled condensers may only be\ninstalled as the primary control system on the existing machines specified in\nparagraph (b)(2) of this section. (ii)\n\nRefrigerated condensers must be equipped\nwith the following: (a) high and low pressure\ngauges to monitor the proper operation of the condenser during the heated and\ncool-down phases of the drying cycle; and\n(b) a drying sensor/controller designed to\nreduce the solvent vapor concentration by at least 90 percent by weight based\nupon the amount of solvent entering and exiting the control device. (b) Alternative solvent dry cleaning machines. (1)\n\nNew machine installations. Only new\nmachines, relocated machines, or machines less than five years old and\ncertified by the manufacturer or their representative as being in a like new\ncondition, may be installed in any location after the effective date of this\n\nSubpart. Newly installed machines must be dry-to-dry, closed-loop machines that\nare equipped with a refrigerated condenser and meet the requirements of\nsubparagraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section. Operator exhaust ventilation and\nemergency pressure release venting is allowed. (i) Relocated machines. Owners of permitted\nor registered dry cleaning facilities may relocate from the facility any\nalternative solvent dry cleaning machines, that are less than 10 years old and\notherwise meet the requirements of this paragraph, to any facility under the\nsame ownership if the facility meets all other applicable requirements and a\nnew or modified air permit or registration is first obtained. (ii)\n\nOperator exhaust ventilation. After\ncompletion of the drying cycle, and for the purpose of minimizing operator\nexposure, drum evacuation systems may be activated to draw fresh room air into\nthe drum and vent any residual solvent vapor to the atmosphere. Drum evacuation\nsystems must isolate the drum from the rest of the machine prior to\nactivation. (2)\n\nExisting\nmachine requirements. Compliant alternative solvent dry cleaning equipment\ninstalled prior to the effective date of this Subpart and listed in\nsubparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph must be operated as\nspecified. Machines that are in need of replacement or removed from service may\nonly be replaced with exempt equipment or a perc or alternative solvent machine\nallowed under this Part. (i) Washing, washing\nwith extraction, and extraction machines may be operated until December 31, 2031. Thereafter, these washing, washing and extracting, and extracting\ntransfer machines must be removed from service. (ii)\n\nDryers may be operated as specified\nbelow: (a) Dryers without a primary control\nsystem may be operated until December 31, 2021. Thereafter, these uncontrolled\ndryers must be removed from service. (b) Solvent recovery dryers that are equipped\nwith a water cooled condenser as the primary control system may be operated\nuntil December 31, 2026. Thereafter, these solvent recovery dryers that are\nequipped with a water cooled condenser must be removed from service. (c) Solvent recovery dryers that are equipped\nwith a refrigerated condenser as the primary control system may be operated\nuntil December 31, 2031. Thereafter, these solvent recovery dryers that are\nequipped with a refrigerated condenser must be removed from service. (iii)\n\nDry-to-dry, closed-loop dry\ncleaning machines that are equipped with a water cooled condenser or\nrefrigerated condenser as the primary control system may be operated until in\nneed of replacement. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n232-3.3\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register February 28, 2018/Volume XL, Issue 09, eff. 3/9/2018\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
