  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 563.4 - Overhead construction costs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All overhead construction costs, such as engineering, supervision, general\noffice salaries and expenses, construction engineering and supervision by\nothers than the accounting utility, law expenses, insurance, injuries and\ndamages, relief and pensions, taxes and interest, shall be charged to\nparticular jobs or units on the basis of the amounts of such overheads\nreasonably applicable thereto, to the end that each job or unit shall bear its\nequitable proportion of such costs and that the entire cost of the unit, both\ndirect and overhead, shall be deducted from the plant accounts at the time the\nproperty is retired. (b) As far as\npracticable, the determination of payroll charges includible in construction\noverheads shall be based on time card distributions thereof. Where this\nprocedure is impractical, special studies shall be made periodically of the\ntime of supervisory employees devoted to construction activities to the end\nthat only such overhead costs as have a definite relation to construction shall\nbe capitalized. The addition to direct construction costs of arbitrary\npercentages or amounts to cover assumed overhead costs is not\npermitted. (c) The records\nsupporting the entries for overhead construction costs shall be so kept as to\nshow the total amount of each overhead for each year, the nature and amount of\neach overhead expenditure charged to each construction work order and to each\nutility plant account, and the basis of distribution of such costs. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n563.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
