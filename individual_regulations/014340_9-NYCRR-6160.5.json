  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6160.5 - Proposal submission\n\nState Regulations\n\nOmission of the required information or failure to comply\nwith these instructions may cause the proposal to be rejected for consideration\nfor funding. (a) Format. The narrative\nportion of the application (that is, excluding the budget) must not exceed 15\ndouble-spaced pages. Additional information may be included as appendices, but\napplicants should remain aware that the proposal review will focus on the\n15-or-fewer-page narrative. Reviewers will not be responsible for digging\nthrough appendices for information required as part of the proposal. Handwritten applications are acceptable as long as they are neat, easily\nlegible and fit the above limitations. (b) Copies. Applicants must submit two copies\nof their applications. Each copy must be individually assembled and fastened or\nstapled at the upper left hand corner--no special covers or binders. (c) Content. Each section of the application\nnarrative must be completed or a notation made as to its nonapplicability to\nthe proposed project. To maintain objectivity and promote fairness in\ncompetition, Division of Criminal Justice Services staff will not assist\napplicants in preparing their specific proposals. General questions dealing\nwith clarification of requirements may be discussed with division staff. (1)\n\nApplications will be reviewed on the\nbasis of reasonableness of cost for the accomplishments expected, as compared\nwith the proposed expenditures. Better to be modest in size and well planned\nthan grandiose and unattainable. (2)\n\nAny equipment requested must be fully\njustified as an essential component of the project. Allowable expenditures\ninclude, but are not limited to, security devices for financially needy, victim-prone residents, radios, signs, gasoline used by volunteers, consumable\nsupplies, staff salaries and patrol vehicles for the exclusive use of\nvolunteers. Patrol vehicles and other large equipment may be leased; purchase\nof either requires full justification. (3)\n\nAuxiliary police applications must\ncontain a crime prevention project activity such as those listed in section\n6160.3\nof this Part. \"Saturation\npatrols,\" \"police omnipresence,\" \"special-event control,\" and the like do not, alone, constitute crime prevention projects fundable under this act. Auxiliary\npolice funded hereunder must work to engage community participation in crime\nprevention activities such as those in section\n6160.3\nof this Part. Either the\ncommunity as a whole or targeted populations within it (shoppers, schoolchildren, elderly, dwellers in geographically designated areas, etc.) as\nwell as routine auto and/or foot patrols in support of police department\nservice. All equipment requests must be fully justified in light of the project\nactivities planned, as with other proposals. (d) Required attachments. All applicants must\ninclude a letter of endorsement from their local law enforcement agency heads\nwith their proposals. Applicants must also include a notarized statement\nattesting to the fact that their organization has existed as an organization\nfor at least one year in the three-year period preceding proposal submission\nwith their proposals. A copy of their incorporation papers, for those applicant\norganizations which are incorporated, may be substituted for the notarized\nstatement with their proposals. (e) Deadline. Applications must be received by the Division of Criminal Justice\n\nServices by the deadline established by the Commissioner of the Division of\n\nCriminal Justice Services and noted on the memorandum accompanying the request\nfor proposal. It is the responsibility of applicants to make sure that their\nproposals are received by the division no later than the date and time named. The deadline is the date of receipt, not the postmark date. (f) Rejection. Proposals arriving after the\ndeadline date or time will be noted, then returned to the applicants. Proposals\nwhich are accepted and later found to be lacking in required information, warranting their rejection, will be returned to the applicant. (g) Acceptance. Proposals which arrive on\ntime and which are accompanied by letter of endorsement and notarized statement\nwill be accepted for review. An acknowledgment of receipt and acceptance will\nbe sent promptly to the applicant. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n6160.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
