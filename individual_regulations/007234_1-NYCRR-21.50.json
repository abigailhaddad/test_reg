Tit. 1 § 21.50 - Net pool obligation of marketers with pool plants\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor the purpose of computing the net pool obligation of\nany marketer operating a pool plant and any collecting cooperative which has\narranged to make the reports and payments with respect to the milk producers\neach month, the commissioner shall determine for each month the value of milk\nof each marketer with respect to each of the marketer's pool plants and of such\na collecting cooperative with respect to milk that was not received at a pool\nplant by adding the amounts computed in subdivisions (a) through (h) of this\nsection and subtracting from that total amount the value computed in\nsubdivision (i) of this section. Unless otherwise specified, the skim milk, butterfat, and the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat referred to in\nthis section shall result from the steps set forth in section\n21.34\nof this Part and the nonfat\ncomponents of producer milk in each class shall be based upon the proportion of\nsuch components in producer skim milk. Receipts of nonfluid milk products that\nare distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to\nthe producer-settlement fund of another order shall be excluded from pricing\nunder this section. (a) Class I value. (1)\n\nMultiply the pounds of skim milk in Class\nI by the Class I skim milk price. (2)\n\nAdd an amount obtained by multiplying the\npounds of butterfat in Class I by the Class I butterfat price. (b) Class II value. (1)\n\nMultiply the pounds of nonfat solids in\n\nClass II skim milk by the Class II nonfat solids price. (2)\n\nAdd an amount obtained by multiplying the\npounds of butterfat in Class II times the Class II butterfat price. (c) Class III value. (1)\n\nMultiply the pounds of protein in Class\nIII skim milk by the protein price. (2)\n\nAdd an amount obtained by multiplying the\npounds of other solids in Class III skim milk by the other solids\nprice. (3)\n\nAdd an amount obtained\nby multiplying the pounds of butterfat in Class III by the butterfat\nprice. (d) Class IV\nvalue. (1)\n\nMultiply the pounds of nonfat\nsolids in Class IV skim milk by the nonfat solids price. (2)\n\nAdd an amount obtained by multiplying the\npounds of butterfat in Class IV by the butterfat price. (e) Multiply the pounds of skim milk and\nbutterfat overage assigned to each class pursuant to section\n21.34\n(a)(15)\nof\nthis Part and the corresponding step of section\n21.34\n(b) of this\n\nPart by the skim milk prices and butterfat prices applicable to each\nclass. (f) Multiply the difference\nbetween the current month's Class I, II or III price, as the case may be, and\nthe Class IV price for the preceding month by the hundredweight of skim milk\nand butterfat subtracted from Class I, II or III, respectively, pursuant to\nsection\n21.34\n(a)(11)\nof\nthis Part and the corresponding step of section\n21.34\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (g) Multiply the difference\nbetween the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the\n\nClass IV price by the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat assigned to\n\nClass I pursuant to section\n21.30\n(b) of this\n\nPart and the hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I\npursuant to section\n21.34\n(a)(9)\nof\nthis Part and the corresponding step of section\n21.34\n(b) of this\n\nPart, excluding receipts of bulk fluid cream products from a plant regulated\nunder other Federal orders and bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool\nplants, plants regulated under Federal orders, and unregulated supply\nplants. (h) Multiply the difference\nbetween the Class I price applicable at the location of the nearest nonpool\nplant not regulated by a Federal order from which an equivalent volume was\nreceived and the Class III price by the pounds of skim milk and butterfat in\nreceipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to\nsections\n21.30\n(b) and\n21.34\n(a)(9)\nand\nthe corresponding step of section\n21.34\n(b) of this\n\nPart and the pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant\nto section\n21.34\n(a)(12)\nof\nthis Part and the corresponding step of section\n21.34\n(b) of this\n\nPart, excluding such skim milk and butterfat in receipts of fluid milk products\nfrom a nonpool plant not regulated by a Federal order to the extent that an\nequivalent amount of skim milk or butterfat disposed of to such plant by\nmarketers fully regulated under any Federal milk order is classified and priced\nas Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation\nunder any order. (i) For\nreconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, multiply $1.00\n(but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the\nlocation of the pool plant and the Class IV price) by the hundredweight of skim\nmilk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are\nallocated to Class I use.
