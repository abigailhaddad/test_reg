  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-1.4 - Installment sales\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn the case of an asset sale where the proceeds of the\nsale are received by the seller on an installment basis as provided for in IRC\nsection 453, the portion of the receipts or gains attributable to New York must\nbe determined in the year of the sale by applying the apportionment rules in\nsection 210-A and this Subchapter. The same ratio of New York receipts to\neverywhere receipts from the installment income for each type of asset shall be\nused in subsequent years to determine how much of the installment payment is\nincluded in New York receipts. The entire amount of the annual installment is\nincluded in everywhere receipts. (a) Example. Corporation C sells its building in New York in the 2021\ntax year and has a $5,000,000 gain. It has no other sales of real property. Under the sales agreement, the proceeds of the sale will be paid to Corporation\nC in 5 equal annual installments. As the real property is located in New York, the entire gain is attributable to New York and $1,000,000 is included in New\n\nYork receipts and everywhere receipts each year. In tax year 2021, besides the installment gain, Corporation C has $20,000,000 of rental income from its New York property and\n$5,000,000 of rental income from real property located outside New York. Corporation C has $21,000,000 of New York receipts ($1,000,000 of the gain from\nthe New York real estate installment sale and $20,000,000 of rental income from\nthe New York property) and $26,000,000 of everywhere receipts ($1,000,000 of\nthe gain from the real estate installment sale and $25,000,000 of rental income\nfrom real property located within and without New York State). Its BAF for the\n2021 tax year is 0.807692. In tax year 2022, beside the installment gain, Corporation C has only $2,000,000 of rental income from real property located\noutside of New York. Corporation C has $1,000,000 of New York receipts (its\nsecond installment of the gain from New York real property) and $3,000,000 of\neverywhere receipts ($1,000,000 of its second installment of gains from the\nsale of real property plus $2,000,000 of rental income from real property\nlocated outside New York State). Its BAF for the 2022 tax year is\n0.333333. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
