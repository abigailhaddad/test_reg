(2)\n\nOnly CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 units may receive CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone\n\nSeason Group 2 allowances from the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone\n\nSeason Group 2 new unit set-aside allocations established in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision. (3)\nCSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 new unit set-aside allowances\nmay be transferred to CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2\nunits for no more than eight consecutive control periods, starting with the\nlatter of the 2021 control period or the control period during which the CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 unit commenced, or is projected\nto commence, operation and ending with the control period preceding the first\ncontrol period for which the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season\n\nGroup 2 unit will receive an allocation pursuant to paragraph 243.3(b)(2) of\nthis part. (4)\n\nThe designated\nrepresentative of a CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 unit\nmust submit a written request to the department to reserve for the CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 unit a number of CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 allowances in the relevant\nCSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 new unit set-aside\naccount in an amount no greater than the number representing the unit's\npotential to emit. The reservation request must be submitted prior to January\n1st of the control period to which the reservation request pertains. The\ndepartment will not consider any request for the reservation of CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 new unit set-aside allowances\nsubmitted prior to the issuance of all permits and authorizations by the\ndepartment that are necessary for operation of the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 unit. The reservation request must include\ninformation detailing the potential to emit of the CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 unit. (5)\n\nSubject to the number of CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 allowances allocated to each\nnew unit set-aside account, following department approval of the request for\nreservation of CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2\nallowances, the department will reserve CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone\n\nSeason Group 2 allowances in the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season\n\nGroup 2 new unit set-aside account before the start of the control period for\nwhich the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 unit will\nreceive an allocation pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section in an amount\nno greater than the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2\nunit's potential to emit. (6)\n\nIf\nmore than one CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 unit\nrequests the reservation of CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group\n2 allowances and the number of requested allowances exceeds the allocation to\nthe relevant CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 new unit\nset-aside account, the department will reserve CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 allowances from the account for the units in the order in\nwhich the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 units submitted\napprovable reservation requests. For the purposes of this paragraph, requests\nwill be considered simultaneous if they are made in the same calendar quarter. Should approvable reservation requests in excess of the allocation to the\nrelevant CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 new unit\nset-aside account be submitted in the same calendar quarter by different CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 units, the department will\nreserve CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 allowances for\nthose units on a basis proportional to the number of CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 allowances requested by each\nCSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 unit. (7)\n\nBy July 1st of each year, the department\nwill submit a request to the Administrator, in a format prescribed by the\n\nAdministrator, to transfer reserved CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone\n\nSeason Group 2 allowances to the compliance account of the CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 source that includes the\nrelevant CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 unit in an\namount no greater than the number representing the unit's potential to\nemit. (8)\n\nAfter the Administrator\nmakes the deductions for compliance under\n40 CFR\n97.824\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this title) for a control\nperiod, the department will determine whether any CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 allowances remain in the CSAPR\nNO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 new unit set-aside account for\nthe control period. By July 1st following the control period, the department\nwill transfer any remaining CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group\n2 allowances from the CSAPR NO\nx\n\nOzone Season Group 2 new\nunit set-aside account to the EERET account. Allowances transferred to the\nEERET account will be available for sale or other disposition in accordance\nwith section\n243.6\nof this part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
