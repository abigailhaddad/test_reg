  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6210.21 - Absentee Ballot Envelope Cures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Curable Absentee Ballot Envelope Defects. The following are curable defects related to an absentee\nballot affirmation envelope: (1)\nthe\naffirmation envelope is unsigned; or\n(2)\nan affirmation ballot envelope signature\ndoes not correspond to the registration signature and thus does not appear to\nverify the voter; or\n(3)\nthe\naffirmation envelope does not have the required witness to a mark; or\n(4)\nthe ballot is returned without an\naffirmation envelope in the return envelope: or\n(5)\nthe affirmation envelope is signed by the\nperson that has provided assistance to the voter but is not signed or marked by\nthe voter him/herself; or\n(6)\nthe\nvoter has failed to sign the affirmation envelope and someone else has signed\nthe affirmation. (b) Notice to the Voter. (1)\n\nUpon a bipartisan\ndetermination of the board of elections that any of the curable conditions in\nsubdivision (a) have occurred, within one day of making such determination, the\nboard of elections shall mail the voter a notice explaining the reason for such\nrejection and the procedure to cure the rejection. (2)\n\nThe notice shall be sent to the absentee\nvoter's address indicated in the registration records and, if different, the\nmailing address indicated on the absentee ballot application. (3)\n\nThe board of elections shall also attempt\nto contact the voter by electronic mail and telephone, if such information is\navailable to the board in the voter's registration information or absentee\napplication, to notify the voter of the deficiency and the opportunity and the\nprocess to cure the deficiency. If more than one email address is available to\nthe board, send the notice to all email addresses in the voter's file. Any\nnotification at-tempted by email shall include a copy of the notice and cure\naffirmation. If more than one phone number is available to the board, the board\nshall contact each phone number in the voter's file. (4)\n\nWhere applicable, the board will email\nnotice and make an initial telephone attempt within one day of making the\ndetermination of error. To the extent practicable, the board shall make at\nleast three attempts, over atleast two days, at different times of the day to\ncontact the voter by telephone. (5)\n\nIf upon reaching the actual voter and confirming the voter's identity by asking\ntheir name, date of birth, and voter registration address, the absentee voter\nthen provides an email address to which such cure affirmation may be emailed, the board shall send the cure affirmation to the voter via email. (c) Form of Cure Affirmation. The\nvoter may cure the aforesaid defects by filing a duly signed affirmation\nattesting to the same information required by the affirmation envelope and\nattesting that the signer of the affirmation is the same person who submitted\nsuch absentee ballot. The board shall include the form of such affirmation with\nthe notice to the voter. The affirmation shall be substantially in the form\npromulgated by the New York State Board of Elections. (d) Deadlines for Cure. (1)\n\nPre-election. (i) The cure affirmation shall be filed\n(postmarked if by mail) with the Board of Elections on or before either the\nlast day to apply for an absentee ballot or seven business days after\nnotification bymail, which-ever is later. (ii)\n\nSuch cures may be filed with the boards\nof elections by email, facsimile, in person or by mail; provided, however, if\nthe voter's application for the absentee ballot did not contain a \"wet\"\nsignature the cure affirmation must be filed with the board by mail or personal\ndelivery. (2)\n\nPost-election. The cure affirmation shall be filed in the same method as\npre-election cures, however, they shall be filed within seven business days\nafter notification by mail. (e) Determination of Cure. Provided the board\ndetermines that such affirmation remedies the cur-able defect, the rejected\nballot shall be reinstated and duly canvassed at the time of canvass. If the\nboard of elections is split as to the sufficiency of the cure affirmation, such\nenvelope shall be set aside for three days and then canvassed unless the board\nis directed otherwise by court order. (f) Notice of Any Rejection. (1)\n\nWhen the board of elections invalidates\nan absentee ballot envelope for any reason that is not otherwise curable, and\nthis determination is made prior to election day, the voter shall be notified\nby mail, and email where available, of the rejection of their ballot. The\nrejection notification shall be sent within one business day of such rejection. To the extent practicable, this notice shall inform the voter of options still\navailable to them to vote, such as voting in person or if applicable obtaining\nanother absentee ballot. (2)\n\nWhen\nthe board of elections invalidates an absentee ballot envelope for any reason\nthat is not otherwise curable, and this determination is made after election\nday, the voter shall be notified by mail, or email where available, of the\nrejection of their ballot. No rejection notification shall be required when an\nabsentee ballot is deemed invalid because the voter has voted in person on\nelection day or during early voting. (3)\n\nWhenever a cure affirmation is submitted\nprior to the day of election and is found to be insufficient, to the extent\npracticable the board of elections shall forthwith inform the voter by mail, email and phone of such finding and shall advise the voter of all then existing\noptions for voting. (g) Special Provision Related to Unsealed Envelope. (1)\n\nIf an absentee ballot affirmation\nenvelope is received by the board of elections prior to the election and is\nfound to be unsealed and thus in-valid, the board shall forthwith notify the\nvoter of such defect and notify the voter of other options for voting, and, if\ntime permits, provide the voter with a new absentee ballot. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing paragraph, if the unsealed affirmation envelope is received in a fully sealed, but not\ntaped (unless required for envelope construction) outer mailing envelope, such\nballot envelope shall be treated as a ballot filed without an affirmation\nenvelope and shall be curable by the filing of the cure affirmation. The\naffirmation envelope shall be immediately sealed by the board of elections\nwithout examining the ballot therein. (h) Signature Comparison Standards, Procedure\nand Training. (1)\n\nPrior to any staff person\nbeing assigned to do signature reviews, they shall be trained and prepared for\nsuch task in accordance with guidance developed by the State Board of\n\nElections. (2)\n\nWhen a bipartisan\nstaff team makes a preliminary ruling that the signature on the absentee\naffirmation does not match the voter registration signature on file, the\ndecision shall be elevated to a manager. The bipartisan team of managers has\nfull authority to overrule the initial de-termination of invalidity. If the\nmanagerial team, after reviewing the affirmation signature and all signature\nexemplars that the board has on file, affirms the initial finding of a\nsignature mismatch, the cure procedures outlined above shall be followed. If\nthe initial signature comparison is conducted by the commissioners of the board\nof elections, managerial review of their initial determination of a mismatch\nshall not be required and the cure procedures outlined above shall be\nfollowed. (3)\n\nWhen verifying\nsignatures, the bipartisan team shall keep in mind that everyone writes\ndifferently, and no one signs his or her name exactly the same way twice. Some\nvariation in signatures is to be expected. There are many factors that can lead\nto signature variance, including but not limited to age, disability, underlying\nhealth conditions, writing implement/surface and level of concentration. The\nbipartisan team shall presume that the documents were signed by the same\nperson. If any differences observed can be reasonably explained, the signature\nshould be accepted. (i) Additional Instructions For Absentee Ballot Envelopes As To Circumstances Not\n\nRequiring Cure. Absentee ballot envelopes are not invalid and do not require a\ncure under these circumstances: (1)\n\nUndated or\n\nWrongly Dated Voter Signature. An absentee ballot affirmation envelope that is\nundated or clearly has the wrong date (e.g. the wrong year or month) by the\nvoter is not invalid, provided it is post marked on or prior to Election Day\nand or is otherwise received timely by the board of elections. (2)\n\nMisplacement of Signature or Mark. A\nvoter who signs or marks the ballot affirmation envelope at a place on the\nenvelope other than the designated signature line shall not be invalidated for\nthis reason. The signature or mark need only appear on the same envelope as the\naffirmation. (3)\n\nUse of Ink or\n\nPencil. A voter may use any combination of ink (of any color) or pencil to\ncomplete the ballot envelope. (4)\n\nExtrinsic Materials Exception. Any papers found in the affirmation envelope\nwith the ballot shall not void the ballot if the papers are materials from the\nboard of elections, such as instructions or an application sent by the board of\nelections. (5)\n\nEnvelope\n\nIrregularities. Any extrinsic marks or tears on the ballot envelope that appear\nto be there as a result of the ordinary course of mailing and/or transmittal, shall not invalidate the ballot. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
