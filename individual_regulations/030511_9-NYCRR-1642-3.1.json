Recommended forms, suitable for either loose-leaf or bound books, are illustrated in the exhibits\nof Appendix S-8. The use of forms identical with those exhibited is not\nprescribed and the forms illustrated may be modified in a reasonable manner, so\nlong as the modified forms show the required information, as per the exhibits. The forms are of standard design and may be procured from most stationers or\nadapted from stock forms. It may, however, be found necessary to have the\nvoucher forms specially printed. Notes\nN.Y.
