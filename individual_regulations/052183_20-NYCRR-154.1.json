One New York State personal income tax return must be filed on form\nIT-201 for the resident portion of the year, and another New York State\npersonal income tax return must be filed on form IT-203 for the nonresident\nperiod if such individual meets any of the following conditions: (1)\n\nSuch individual's New York adjusted gross\nincome from all sources during the resident period plus such individual's New\n\nYork adjusted gross income from New York State sources during the nonresident\nperiod equals or exceeds: (i) $600 (or $1,200\nif such individual is at least 65 years of age at the close of the taxable\nyear) for taxable years beginning in or after 1960 but before 1970; (ii)\n$625 (or $1,250 if such individual is at\nleast 65 years of age at the close of the taxable year) for taxable years\nbeginning in 1970; (iii)\n$650 (or\n$1,300 if such individual is at least 65 years of age at the close of the\ntaxable year) for taxable years beginning in or after 1971 but before\n1979; (iv)\n$700 (or $1,400 if such\nindividual is at least 65 years of age at the close of the taxable year) for\ntaxable years beginning in 1979; (v) $750 (or $1,500 if such individual is at\nleast 65 years of age at the close of the taxable year) for taxable years\nbeginning in 1980 and 1981; (vi)\n$800 (or $1,600 if such individual is at least 65 years of age at the close of\nthe taxable year) for taxable years beginning in or after 1982 but before\n1985; (vii)\n$850 (or $1,700 if such\nindividual is at least 65 years of age at the close of the taxable year) for\ntaxable years beginning in 1985 and 1986; or\n(viii)\n$900 (or $1,800 if such individual is\nat least 65 years of age at the close of the taxable year) for taxable years\nbeginning in 1987 and thereafter. (2)\n\nSuch individual is a New York State\nresident at the close of the taxable year and is required to file a Federal\nincome tax return for the taxable year, or such individual is a nonresident of\n\nNew York State at the close of the taxable year and such individual has\nincurred a net operating loss for New York State personal income tax purposes\nbut did not incur a net operating loss for Federal income tax\npurposes. (3)\n\nFor New York State\nminimum income tax purposes, such individual had New York items of tax\npreference during the period when such individual was a resident in excess of\nthe allowable specific deduction determined under section\n122.7\n(a) of this Title, or such individual had items of tax preference derived from or\nconnected with New York State sources when such individual was a nonresident in\nexcess of the allowable specific deduction determined under section\n141.2\n(a) of this Title. (4)\n\nSuch individual\nis subject to the separate tax imposed by section 601-D of the Tax Law upon the\ntermination of a qualified higher education fund which occurs during the\ntaxable year in either the period of residence or the period of\nnonresidence. (5)\n\nSuch individual\nreceived a lump sum distribution during the taxable year, in either the period\nof residence or the period of nonresidence, any portion of which is subject to\nthe separate tax on the ordinary income portion of the lump sum distribution in\naccordance with the provisions of section 601-C of the Tax Law. (6)\n\nSuch individual wishes to obtain a\nrefund, even though a New York State personal income tax return or returns\nwould not otherwise be required in accordance with the foregoing conditions. (See section\n151.5\nof this Article regarding the filing of New York State personal income tax\nreturns as claims for refund or credit.)\n(b) Exception. (1)\n\nAn individual who is required to file two\n\nNew York State personal income tax returns for the taxable year in accordance\nwith the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section is not required to file\na New York State personal income tax return for the taxable period (either\nprior to or subsequent to the change of residence) during which such individual\nmeets all of the following conditions: (i) such individual had no New York adjusted gross income or New York items of tax\npreference in excess of the allowable specific deduction (see paragraph [a][3]\nof this section); (ii)\nsuch\nindividual was not subject to the separate tax upon the termination of a\nqualified higher education fund; and\n(iii)\nsuch individual was not subject to the\nseparate tax on the ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution. In lieu of the New York State personal income tax\nreturn otherwise required to be filed for the taxable period in which such\nindividual met all of the conditions contained in subparagraphs (i)-(iii) of\nthis paragraph, such individual must attach a statement to or indicate on the\n\nNew York State personal income tax return required to be filed to the effect\nthat for the other taxable period such individual met all of these conditions\n(see also section\n151.6\n[a][2]\nof this Article). However, all of the applicable sections of this Part must be\ntaken into account on the New York State personal income tax return which is\nrequired to be filed in accordance with this subdivision. This includes, but is\nnot limited to, the special accruals required by section\n154.10\nof this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nThe\nprovisions of this subdivision do not relieve an individual from the\nrequirement of filing a New York State resident personal income tax return\nwhere such individual is a New York State resident at the close of the taxable\nyear and is required to file a Federal income tax return for the taxable year\nor to file a New York State nonresident personal income tax return where such\nindividual is a nonresident of New York State at the close of the taxable year\nand such individual has incurred a net operating loss for New York State\npersonal income tax purposes but did not incur a net operating loss for Federal\nincome tax purposes. (c) Where an individual changes his residence (either from or to New York State)\nduring the taxable year, schedule form IT-360 (\nSchedule for Change of\n\nResident Status\n) must be prepared by or for such individual in\naccordance with the instructions contained in Publication 360 and submitted\nwith the New York State personal income tax returns required by this\nsection.
