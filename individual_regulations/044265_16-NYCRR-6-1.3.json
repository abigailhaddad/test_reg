Where the request itself\ncontains information which, if disclosed, would defeat the purpose for which\nthe exception is sought, such information shall also be excepted from\ndisclosure.

(4)\nA person desiring confidential status for\na limited period of time shall indicate such time frame at the time the\ninformation is submitted to the department. (5)\n\nFailure to identify trade secret\ninformation at the time of submission may make the information accessible to\nothers without notice to the person who submitted such information unless a\nspecific exemption from disclosure by other statutes or regulations pertains to\nthe information.
