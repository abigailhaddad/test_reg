  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 709.11 - Inpatient rehabilitation programs for traumatic brain-injured patients\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This\nmethodology will be utilized to evaluate certificate of need applications\ninvolving the initiation of inpatient rehabilitation programs for traumatic\nbrain-injured patients. It is the intent of the State Hospital Review and\n\nPlanning Council that this methodology, when used in conjunction with the\nplanning standards and criteria set forth in section\n709.1\nof this Part, become a\nstatement of planning principles and decisionmaking tools for directing the\ndistribution of inpatient rehabilitation programs for traumatic brain-injured\npatients. The goals and objectives of the methodology expressed herein are\nexpected to ensure that an adequate number of inpatient traumatic brain-injured\nrehabilitation programs and beds are available to provide access to care and\navoid the unnecessary duplication of resources. (b) Inpatient rehabilitation programs for\ntraumatic brain-injured patients are intensive rehabilitation programs designed\nto prevent and/or minimize chronic disabilities while restoring the individual\nto the optimal level of physical, cognitive, and behavioral functioning. These\nprograms are applicable to those individuals who have severe disabling\nimpairments of recent onset and are able to participate daily (at least five\ndays per week) in multi-disciplinary programs for a minimum of three hours per\nday. (c) The factors and\nmethodology for determining the public need for inpatient rehabilitation\nprograms for traumatic brain-injured patients shall include, but not be limited\nto, the following: (1)\n\nThe service area for\ndetermining the public need for inpatient rehabilitation programs for traumatic\nbrain-injured patients shall be the designated health systems agency\nregions. (2)\n\nThe maximum number of\ninpatient rehabilitation beds for traumatic brain-injured patients in each\nhealth systems agency region required to meet the public need shall be\ndetermined by dividing the projected annual patient days for the service by\n365, and dividing the result by 0.90 to allow for 90-percent occupancy. The\nprojected inpatient rehabilitation patient days for traumatic brain-injured\npatients used in this calculation shall be determined as follows: (i) The diagnostic categories used in\ncomputing the need for inpatient rehabilitation beds for traumatic\nbrain-injured patients shall be: brain dysfunction, traumatic brain dysfunction\nand skull fracture. (ii)\n\nThe annual\nnumber of potential candidates for inpatient rehabilitation programs for the\ntraumatic brain-injured shall be determined by calculating the total numbers of\nannual general hospital discharges from the categories considered, plus an\nadditional 10 percent, and multiplying the resulting figure by 0.155. (iii)\n\nThe number of potential candidates for\ninpatient rehabilitation programs for the traumatic brain-injured shall be\nmultiplied by an 85-day rehabilitation length-of-stay to project the annual\nnumber of inpatient rehabilitation days for traumatic brain-injured\npatients. (iv)\nA traumatic\nbrain-injured rehabilitation program that is organized as a specialized unit\nwithin a comprehensive inpatient physical medicine and rehabilitation program\nshall have a minimum of 10 beds. A traumatic brain-injury rehabilitation\nprogram that is organized as a freestanding inpatient rehabilitation program\nshall have a minimum of 20 beds. (v) The Health Systems Agencies may make\nadjustments to these bed need estimates to address patient migration patterns\nand other regional planning issues. (3)\n\nWhere public need is established herein, and in addition to meeting the operating requirements of either section\n405.18\n(e) of this\n\nTitle (traumatic head-injury programs of general hospitals) or section\n415.36\nof this Title (long-term\ninpatient rehabilitation program for head-injured residents in nursing homes), priority consideration will be given to applicants that: (i) Demonstrate a commitment to developing\nand participating in an area-wide network of service organizations which\nprovide and coordinate a full array of rehabilitation, support, education, vocational rehabilitation, recreation, housing, case management and social\nservices for persons with traumatic brain injuries. (ii)\n\nHave a coma recovery care program for\nbrain-injured patients who are unable to participate in an active\nrehabilitation program or have a transfer agreement with a facility that has a\ncoma recovery care program for traumatic brain-injured patients. The number of\ncoma recovery care beds needed in each health systems agency region shall be\ndetermined by the ratio of six beds per 1.5 million population. (iii)\n\nHave an extended care program for\ntraumatic brain-injured patients who are unable to participate in an active\nrehabilitation program or a transfer agreement with a facility that has an\nextended care program for traumatic brain-injured patients. (iv)\n\nWill provide access to New York State\n\nMedicaid recipients or to patients or residents who are likely to become\n\nMedicaid-eligible. (v) Demonstrate\na commitment to serve the medically indigent and patients regardless of the\nsource of payment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
