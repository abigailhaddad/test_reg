  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 202.15 - Videotape recording of civil depositions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When permitted. Depositions\nauthorized under the provisions of the Civil Practice Law and Rules or other\nlaw may be taken, as permitted by section\n3113\n(b) of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, by\nmeans of simultaneous audio and visual electronic recording, provided such\nrecording is made in conformity with this section. (b) Other rules applicable. Except as otherwise provided in this section, or where the nature of videotaped\nrecording makes compliance impossible or unnecessary, all rules generally\napplicable to examinations before trial shall apply to videotaped recording of\ndepositions. (c) Notice of taking deposition. Every notice or subpoena for the taking of a\nvideotaped deposition shall state that it is to be videotaped and the name and\naddress of the videotape operator and of the operator's employer, if any. The\noperator may be an employee of the attorney taking the deposition. Where an\napplication for an order to take a videotaped deposition is made, the\napplication and order shall contain the same information. (d) Conduct of the examination. (1)\n\nThe deposition shall begin\nby one of the attorneys or the operator stating on camera: (i) the operator's name and\naddress; (ii)\nthe name\nand address of the operator's employer; (iii)\nthe date, the time and place of the\ndeposition; and\n(iv)\nthe party on whose behalf the deposition is being taken. The officer before whom the deposition is\ntaken shall be a person authorized by statute and shall identify himself or\nherself and swear the witness on camera. If the deposition requires the use of\nmore than one tape, the end of each tape and the beginning of each succeeding\ntape shall be announced by the operator. (2)\n\nEvery videotaped deposition\nshall be timed by means of a time-date generator which shall permanently record\nhours, minutes and seconds. Each time the videotape is stopped and resumed, such times shall be orally announced on the tape. (3)\n\nMore than one camera may be\nused, either in sequence or simultaneously. (4)\n\nAt the conclusion of the deposition, a statement shall be made on camera that the recording is completed. As soon as\npracticable thereafter, the videotape shall be shown to the witness for\nexamination, unless such showing and examination are waived by the witness and\nthe parties. (5)\n\nTechnical data, such as recording speeds and other information needed to replay\nor copy the tape, shall be included on copies of the videotaped\ndeposition. (e) Copies and transcription. The parties\nmay make audio copies of the deposition and thereafter may purchase additional\naudio and audio-visual copies. A party may arrange to have a stenographic\ntranscription made of the deposition at his or her own expense. (f) Certification. The officer\nbefore whom the videotape deposition is taken shall cause to be attached to the\noriginal videotape recording a certification that the witness was fully sworn\nor affirmed by the officer and that the videotape recording is a true record of\nthe testimony given by the witness. If the witness has not waived the right to\na showing and examination of the videotape deposition, the witness shall also\nsign the certification in accordance with the provisions of section\n3116\nof the Civil Practice Law and\n\nRules. (g) Filing and\nobjections. (1)\n\nIf no objections\nhave been made by any of the parties during the course of the deposition, the\nvideotape deposition may be filed by the proponent with the clerk of the trial\ncourt and shall be filed upon the request of any party. (2)\n\nIf objections have been made\nby any of the parties during the course of the deposition, the videotape\ndeposition, with the certification, shall be submitted to the court upon the\nrequest of any of the parties within 10 days after its recording, or within\nsuch other period as the parties may stipulate, or as soon thereafter as the\nobjections may be heard by the court, for the purpose of obtaining rulings on\nthe objections. An audio copy of the sound track may be submitted in lieu of\nthe videotape for this purpose, as the court may prefer. The court may view\nsuch portions of the videotape recording as it deems pertinent to the\nobjections made, or may listen to an audiotape recording. The court, in its\ndiscretion, may also require submission of a stenographic transcript of the\nportion of the deposition to which objection is made, and may read such\ntranscript in lieu of reviewing the videotape or audio copy. (3)\n(i) The court shall rule on the\nobjections prior to the date set for trial and shall return the recording to\nthe proponent of the videotape with notice to the parties of its rulings and of\nits instructions as to editing. The editing shall reflect the rulings of the\ncourt and shall remove all references to the objections. The proponent, after\ncausing the videotape to be edited in accordance with the court's instructions, may cause both the original videotape recording and the deleted version of the\nrecording, clearly identified, to be filed with the clerk of the trial court, and shall do so at the request of any party. Before such filing, the proponent\nshall permit the other party to view the edited videotape. (ii)\n\nThe court may, in respect\nto objectionable material, instead of ordering its deletion, permit such\nmaterial to be clearly marked so that the audio recording may be suppressed by\nthe operator during the objectionable portion when the videotape is presented\nat the trial. In such case the proponent may cause both the original videotape\nrecording and a marked version of that recording, each clearly identified, to\nbe filed with the clerk of the trial court, and shall do so at the request of\nany party. (h) Custody of tape. When the tape is\nfiled with the clerk of the court, the clerk shall give an appropriate receipt\nfor the tape and shall provide secure and adequate facilities for the storage\nof videotape recordings. (i) Use at trial. The use of videotape\nrecordings of depositions at the trial shall be governed by the provisions of\nthe Civil Practice Law and Rules and all other relevant statutes, court rules\nand decisional law relating to depositions and relating to the admissibility of\nevidence. The proponent of the videotaped deposition shall have the\nresponsibility of providing whatever equipment and personnel may be necessary\nfor presenting such videotape deposition. (j) Applicability to audio taping of\ndepositions. Except where clearly inapplicable because of the lack of a video\nportion, these rules are equally applicable to the taking of depositions by\naudio recording alone. However, in the case of the taking of a deposition upon\nnotice by audio recording alone, any party, at least five days before the date\nnoticed for taking the deposition, may apply to the court for an order\nestablishing additional or alternate procedures for the taking of such audio\ndeposition, and upon the making of the application, the deposition may be taken\nonly in accordance with the court order. (k) Cost. The cost of videotaping or\naudio recording shall be borne by the party who served the notice for the\nvideotaped or audio recording of the deposition, and such cost shall be a\ntaxable disbursement in the action unless the court in its discretion orders\notherwise in the interest of justice. (l) Transcription for appeal. On appeal, visual and audio depositions shall be transcribed in the same manner as other\ntestimony and transcripts filed in the appellate court. The visual and audio\ndepositions shall remain part of the original record in the case and shall be\ntransmitted therewith. In lieu of the transcribed deposition and, on leave of\nthe appellate court, a party may request a viewing of portions of the visual\ndeposition by the appellate court but, in such case, a transcript of pertinent\nportions of the deposition shall be filed as required by the court.
