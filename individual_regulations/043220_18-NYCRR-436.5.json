  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 436.5 - Payment of kinship guardianship assistance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nOnce the prospective relative guardian with whom a social services official has\nentered into an agreement under section\n436.4\nof this Part has been issued\nletters of guardianship for the child by the court and the child has been\nfinally discharged from foster care to such relative, a social services\nofficial must make monthly kinship guardianship assistance payments for the\ncare and maintenance of the child. (2)\n\nIn the event of death or incapacity of a\nrelative guardian, a social services official must make monthly kinship\nguardianship assistance payments for the care and maintenance of a child to a\nsuccessor guardian that has been approved pursuant to this Part. (3)\n\nFollowing the death or incapacity of the\nrelative guardian, a social services official must approve a prospective\nsuccessor guardian who is named in the agreement between the relative guardian\nand a social services official for payments under this Part and who has been\nawarded guardianship or permanent guardianship of the child by the court\nunless, based on the results of the clearances required by section\n436.3\nof this Part, the social\nservices official has determined that approval of the prospective successor\nguardian is not authorized or appropriate. Provided however, that no approval\ncan be issued pursuant to this paragraph unless the prospective successor\nguardian has been awarded guardianship or permanent guardianship of the child\nby the court and the clearances required by section 436. 3 of this Part have\nbeen conducted. (4)\n\nNotwithstanding\nany other provision of law to the contrary, if a prospective successor guardian\nassumes care of the child prior to being approved pursuant to paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision, payments under this Part must be made once a prospective\nguardian is approved pursuant to such paragraph retroactively from: (i) in the event of death of the relative\nguardian, the date the successor guardian assumed care of the child or the date\nof death of the relative guardian, whichever is later; or\n(ii)\nin the event of incapacity of the\nrelative guardian, the date the successor guardian assumed care of the child or\nthe date of incapacity of the relative guardian, whichever is later. (5)\n\nIn the event that a successor\nguardian assumed care and was awarded guardianship or permanent guardianship of\na child due to the incapacity of a relative guardian and the relative guardian\nis subsequently awarded or resumes guardianship or permanent guardianship of\nsuch child and assumes care of such child after the incapacity ends, a social\nservices official must make monthly kinship guardianship assistance payments\nfor the care and maintenance of the child to the relative guardian, in\naccordance with the terms of the fully executed written agreement. (b) The amount of the monthly\nkinship guardianship assistance payment made pursuant to this section must not\nbe less than 75 percent of the applicable board rate nor more than 100 percent\nof such rate as determined by the social services district in accordance with\nthis section, provided, however, that the rate chosen by the social services\ndistrict must be equal to the rate used by the social services district for\nadoption subsidy payments under section\n453\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law. The social services official may consider the financial\nstatus of the prospective relative guardian or relative guardian only for the\npurpose of determining the amount of the payments to be made. (c) Computation of annual income is subject\nto the following provisions: (1)\n\nOnly income\nearned as wages or salary from employment and/or net income from nonfarm\nself-employment or net income from farm self-employment as defined in section\n404.5\n(b)(5)\nof\nthis Title may be considered in computing annual income. The income of persons\nother than the prospective relative guardian may not be considered. (2)\n\nAs evidence of income, a social services\nofficial may request wage stubs, or a recent W-2, or an employer's statement of\nwages, or, in the case of income other than wages or salary, a copy of the\nprospective relative guardian's latest Federal income tax return. (3)\n\nWhen the person assuming guardianship is\n62 years of age or older, or will be subject to mandatory retirement from\npresent employment within five years of the date of assuming guardianship, such\nperson's income shall be disregarded in computing annual income. (d) (1)\n\nIf the annual income of the prospective\nrelative guardian, as determined by the applicable provisions of subdivision\n(c) of this section is equal to or less than the applicable State income\nstandard, the monthly payment for care and maintenance of the child must be 100\npercent of the applicable board rate, unless the prospective relative guardian, in writing requests and agrees to a lower rate. (2)\n\nIf the annual income of the prospective\nrelative guardian, as determined by the applicable provisions of this section, is greater that the applicable State income standard, a social services\ndistrict has two options in determining the amount to be paid for care and\nmaintenance of the child. Unless the prospective relative guardian voluntarily\nand, in writing, requests and agrees to a lower amount, such amount must be\neither: (i) 100 percent of the applicable\nboard rate, regardless of the annual income of the prospective relative\nguardian; or\n(ii)\nan amount less\nthat 100 percent, but not less than 75 percent, of the applicable board rate, as determined in accordance with the following formula. The social services\ndistrict must: (a) calculate the annual\nincome of the prospective relative guardian pursuant to the provisions of\nsubdivision (c) of this section; (b) determine what percentage of such annual\nincome is of the applicable State income standard; and\n(c) use the following schedule to determine\nthe amount to be paid based on the percentage calculated in clause\n(\nb\n) this subparagraph: KINSHIP GUARDIANSHIP ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS SCHEDULE\nAnnual income of relative guardian(s)\npercentage of applicable State income standard\n\nAmount of kinship guardianship assistance\npayment\n\nOver 100% but not more that 110%\n95% of Applicable Board Rate\n\nOver 110% but not more than 120%\n90% of Applicable Board Rate\n\nOver 120% but not more than 130%\n85% of Applicable Board Rate\n\nOver 130% but not more that 140%\n80% of Applicable Board Rate\n\nOver 140%\n75% of Applicable Board Rate\n(d) The social services district must use the\nsame option for all kinship guardianship assistance cases. If a social services\ndistrict wishes to change from one option to other option, the district must\ninform the office in writing of the intended change at least 30 days prior to\nthe effective date of the change. In addition, such change in option must also\napply to the district's adoption subsidy payments. The district must use the\nnewly selected option for all new kinship guardianship assistance agreements\nentered into on or after the effective date of the change. Kinship guardianship\nassistance agreements finalized prior to the effective date of the change will\nnot be affected by the change. (e) Kinship guardianship assistance payments must be made to the relative guardian\nor guardians or to the successor guardian or guardians until the child's 18th\nbirthday or until the child attains 21 years of age provided the child\nconsented upon attaining the age of 18 to the continuation of guardianship and\nis: (1)\ncompleting secondary education or a\nprogram leading to an equivalent credential; (2)\nenrolled in an institution which provides\npost-secondary or vocational education; (3)\nemployed for at least 80 hours per\nmonth; (4)\nparticipating in a\nprogram or activity designed to promote, or remove barriers to, employment; or\n(5)\nincapable of any such\nactivities due to a medical condition, which incapacity is supported by\nregularly updated information in the child's case record. (f) (1)\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) and subdivision (e) of this section, and\nexcept as provided for in paragraphs (a)(2)-(4) of this section, no kinship\nguardianship assistance payments may be made pursuant to title 10 of article 6\nof the Social Services Law or this Part if the social services official\ndetermines that the child is no longer receiving any support from the relative\nguardian or that the relative guardian is no longer legally responsible for the\nsupport of the child, including: (i) if the\nstatus of the legal guardian is revoked, terminated, suspended or surrendered; or\n(ii)\nwhen the child is removed\nfrom the home of the relative guardian or the successor guardian, placed into\nfoster care and the Family Court has approved a permanency planning goal for\nthe child of other than return to the home of the relative guardian or the\nsuccessor guardian. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) and subdivision (e) of this section, and\nexcept as provided for in paragraph (a)(5) of this section, no kinship\nguardianship assistance payments may be made pursuant to a successor guardian\nif the social services official determines that the successor guardian is no\nlonger legally responsible for the support of the child, including if the\nstatus of the successor guardian is terminated or the child is no longer\nreceiving any support from such guardian. A successor guardian who has been\nreceiving kinship guardianship assistance payments on behalf of a child under\nthis Part must keep the social services official informed, on an annual basis, of any circumstances that would make the successor guardian ineligible for such\npayments or eligible for payments in a different amount. (3)\n(i) When there is a failure to respond to the annual notification, pursuant to\nsection\n436.6\nof this Part, or otherwise\nwhen a social services district has reasonable cause to suspect that the\nrelative guardian or successor guardian is either no longer legally responsible\nfor the support of the child or is no longer providing any support for the\nchild, such district may require the relative guardian or successor guardian to\nsubmit documentation, as specified by the district, that addresses and verifies\nthe continuing responsibility of the relative guardian or successor guardian to\nsupport the child and/or the provision of support of the child by the relative\nguardian or successor guardian. The relative guardian or successor guardian is\nrequired to provide the required documentation in the time period established\nby the district and to cooperate with the district. In addition, the district\nmay require the relative guardian or successor guardian to meet with district\nstaff in person, by telephone or by other means of communication, as specified\nby the district, to review the status of the case. The district must take into\nconsideration where the relative guardian or successor guardian resides, the\nrelative guardian's or successors guardian's employment situation and the care\nneeds of the child when determining the time and location of, and the means of\ncommunication for, such meeting. If the relative guardian or successor guardian\nis unable to make the scheduled meeting for reasons beyond the relative\nguardian's or successor guardian's control, the district must provide the\nrelative guardian or successor guardian with one additional opportunity to meet\nin accordance with the standards set forth in this paragraph. Failure to\nprovide the requested documentation within the period requested or to meet with\ndistrict staff as directed may be a ground for termination of the kinship\nguardianship assistance agreement. (ii)\n\nWhen determining whether the relative\nguardian or successor guardian is providing the child with any support for the\npurposes of this paragraph, the term, any support from the relative\nguardian\nor\nsuccessor guardian, means actual\ndocumented use at least 50 percent of such monthly kinship guardianship\nassistance payments by the relative guardian or successor guardian for the\nfood, clothing, medical, education and/or shelter needs of the child. (g) The relative\nguardian or successor guardian who has been receiving kinship guardianship\nassistance payments on behalf of a child under title 10 of article 6 of the\n\nSocial Services Law and this Part must keep the social services official\ninformed of any circumstances that would make the relative guardian or\nsuccessor guardian ineligible for such payments or eligible for payments in a\ndifferent amount. The relative guardian or successor guardian must notify the\nsocial services official in writing within 30 days of any circumstance or event\nthat would impact the continued eligibility of the child for kinship\nguardianship assistance. (h) The\nplacement of the child with the relative guardian or successor guardian and any\nkinship guardianship assistance payments made on behalf of the child under this\nsection must be considered never to have been made when determining eligibility\nfor adoption subsidy payments under title 9 of article 6 of the Social Services\n\nLaw and section\n421.24\nof this Title of a child in\nsuch legal guardianship arrangement.
