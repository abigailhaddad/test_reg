  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 815.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In table I an item number is assigned consecutively to\neach specifically designated waters. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number assigned to any designated waters\nfor the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe\nnumbering or index system used to identify specific waters of New York State\nwas adapted from that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey series of reports on the watersheds of the State. The primary\nwaters of a drainage basin, a stream or large lake, is referred to by name or\nabbreviation. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively as they are\nencountered, such number being preceded by the letter P. This system also\ninvolves the consecutive numbering of tributaries as they enter a stream, progressing upstream from the mouth. Tributaries of lakes or ponds are numbered\nconsecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from\nits outlet or mouth. Isolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index\nnumber merely for convenience of their identification and location within a\nsubdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being\ntributary to any waters to which no surface connection is shown on the\nreference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was\napplied to the basin under consideration by the Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey of the Delaware and Susquehanna watersheds in 1935 and has\nbeen closely followed in connection with the identification of the waters with\nthe following exceptions: Some of the stream numbers do not run consecutively\ndue to the omission of streams originally shown on the older maps employed by\nthe Conservation Department at the time of its 1935 survey but not shown on\nnewer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older\nmaps but appearing on the newer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to\nthe identification of waters in the Delaware River Drainage Basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\nD\nDelaware River\n\nPrimary waters within New York State extending\nupstream from Tri-State Rock to the confluence of the East Branch and West\n\nBranch Delaware River. D-1\n\nNeversink River\n\nThe first tributary entering the Delaware River\nupstream from Tri-State Rock. D-71\n\nWest Branch\n\nThe 71st (and last) tributary entering the Delaware\n\nRiver Delaware River upstream from Tri-State Rock. D-71-61\n\nLittle Delaware River\n\nThe 61st tributary entering West Branch Delaware\n\nRiver upstream from its mouth. D-71-61-7-P 420\n\nLake Delaware\n\nThe 420th pond encountered in the waters index\nsystem located on the watershed of the watershed of the 7th tributary upstream\nfrom the mouth of Little Delaware River. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib. and\ntribs. indicating tributary and tributaries, and the terms\nsubtributary\nand\nsubtributaries\nshall mean\nany stream, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other\nstream, pond, or other body of surface water; where no tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated\nwaters shall include only the stream, pond, or other body of water referenced\nby such waters index number; where a tributary, tributaries, subtributary or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, pond, or other body of water\nreferenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and subtributaries\nthereof, which are shown on the reference maps, excluding numbered ponds, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\nknown and which name may appear on the reference maps. In cases of specifically\ndesignated waters which have no name, the named waters to which the unnamed\nwaters are tributary are identified as far as possible. (e) Description. The column headed \"Description\" contains designations of\nsegments or section of waters under consideration to which a particular\nassignment of a class and standards shall apply. Also included in this column\nis any useful information pertinent to the classification or standards. (f) Map Ref. No., as appearing in table I, means map reference number and indicates one or more of the following numbered\nmaps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on which maps the specifically\ndesignated waters and their index numbers are shown within the topographical\nlimit line of the described drainage basin. The following maps were reproduced from original maps\nwhich may be procured through the Washington Distribution Section, Geological\n\nSurvey, Silver Spring, Maryland:......................................................................................................
