Tit. 21 § 1806.32 - Reopening/modification\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Once a project\nis approved, the commission, upon its own motion, or upon petition of the\nproject sponsor or any interested party, may at any time reopen any project\napproval and make additional orders or otherwise modify or impose such\nadditional conditions that may be necessary to mitigate or avoid adverse\nimpacts or to otherwise protect the public health, safety, and welfare or water\nresources. Whenever a petition for reopening is filed by an interested party, the burden shall be upon that interested party to show, by a preponderance of\nthe evidence, that a significant adverse impact or a threat to the public\nhealth, safety and welfare or water resources exists that warrants reopening of\nthe docket. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any petition filed by a party who\npreviously sought the same or functionally equivalent relief identified in the\npetition pursuant to the administrative appeals process under section\n1808.2\nof this Title will not be\neligible for consideration by the commission absent new facts not known or\nreadily discernable at the time of consideration of the petitioner's previous\nrequest for administrative appeal filed pursuant to section\n1808.2\nof this Title. (b) If the project sponsor fails to comply\nwith any term or condition of a commission approval, the commission may issue\nan order suspending, modifying or revoking its approval of the project. The\ncommission may also, in its discretion, suspend, modify or revoke its approval\nif the project sponsor fails to obtain or maintain other Federal, state or\nlocal approvals. (c) For any\npreviously approved project where interference occurs, the commission may\nrequire a project sponsor to provide a temporary source of potable water at the\nproject sponsor's expense, pending a final determination of causation by the\ncommission. (d) The commission, upon\nits own motion, may at any time reopen any project approval and make additional\ncorrective modifications that may be necessary. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
