  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 665.6 - Regulatory procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon\nassumption of local regulatory authority and the filing of applicable official\nmaps by the department, a local government must regulate all regulated\nactivities not otherwise specifically exempted under section 24-0701 of the act\nthat are to be conducted on Class II-IV wetlands or adjacent areas within its\njurisdiction and on Class I wetlands where authority has been delegated by the\ndepartment. (b) A local government, in establishing procedures for the receipt and processing of permit\napplications, must comply with the requirements set out in section 24-0703 of\nthe act: (1)\n\nAny person proposing to conduct\nor cause to be conducted a regulated activity upon any freshwater wetland must\nfile an application for a permit, or request in writing a letter of permission, when appropriate, with the clerk of the local government having regulatory\nauthority. The local government will review the application or request in\naccordance with the act, this Part, and all other applicable laws and rules. Such application or request must include a detailed description of the proposed\nactivity and a map showing the area of freshwater wetland directly affected, with the location of the proposed activity thereon. The clerk will cause notice\nof such application to be mailed to all local governments where the proposed\nactivity or any part of it is located. (2)\n\nNo sooner than 30 days and not later than\n60 days after the receipt by a local government of an application, and after\nnotice of application has been published by the applicant in two newspapers\nhaving a general circulation in the area, the local government will hold a\npublic hearing on such application at a suitable location in the local\ngovernment where the affected wetland is situated unless no notice of objection\nhas been filed and the local government finds the activity to be of such a\nminor nature as not to affect or endanger the balance of systems within the\nwetlands, and has been determined to be compatible pursuant to section\n665.7\nof this Part, in which case\nthe local government may, in the exercise of discretion, dispense with such\nhearing. Where the local government finds that a hearing is not necessary, a\ndecision setting forth reasons therefor shall be prepared, shall be a matter of\npublic record and shall be mailed to all local governments where the proposed\nwork or any part of it is located, and to all persons who filed a statement\nwith the local government following the publication of such notice of\napplication. All owners of record of the adjacent land and the local\ngovernments where the proposed activity is located shall be notified by\ncertified mail of the hearing not less than 15 days prior to the date set for\nsuch hearing. The local government shall cause notice of such hearing to be\npublished in two newspapers having a general circulation in the area where the\naffected freshwater wetlands are located. All applications and maps and\ndocuments relating thereto shall be open to public inspection at the office of\nthe clerk of the local government in which the wetland is situated. At such\nhearing any person or persons filing a request for a hearing or a timely notice\nof appearance may appear and be heard. (3)\n\nThe applicant shall have the burden of\ndemonstrating that the proposed activity will be in accord with the policies\nand provisions of the act and this Part. To the greatest extent practicable, such hearing shall be incorporated with any public hearing required by the\n\nTown, Village, General City, General Municipal or Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw in connection with approvals or permits otherwise required before\ncommencement of regulated activities on lands containing such\nwetlands. (c) Where a\nlocal government is the regulatory authority for a wetland and its adjacent\narea associated with a major international or interstate river or lake, it must\nconsult with the department before taking any regulatory action pursuant to the\nact concerning that wetland or its adjacent area. Those rivers and lakes are\nthe Hudson, Delaware, Susquehanna, Niagara and St. Lawrence Rivers and Lakes\n\nErie, Ontario and Champlain, and are considered to extend in tributaries to the\nfirst barrier impassable to fish or the first bridge, whichever is further\ndownstream. A wetland is associated with such a river or lake when it is\ncontiguous to the body of water or, if separated, the separation is only a\nnarrow strip of land, such as a barrier beach or railroad bed. (d) Where a local government or other\npolitical subdivision of the State is the applicant for a permit pursuant to\nthe act, the department shall serve as the regulatory authority. A local\ngovernment may not process its own application or that of another local\ngovernment or political subdivision of the State. (e) Where a regulated wetland lies within two\nor more jurisdictions, whether that be two or more local governments or the\ndepartment and local government(s): (1)\nthe\nagency receiving the permit application must immediately provide copies to the\nother entities sharing jurisdiction; (2)\nthe agency within whose jurisdiction the\nproposed activity will occur will process the application in consultation with\nthe other entities in order to achieve a mutually satisfactory determination; and\n(3)\ndisagreements over the\nproposed determination may be arbitrated by the department pursuant to the\npolicies and standards of the act and this Part. (f) A person who has obtained an interim\npermit from the department pursuant to Part 662 of this Title prior to the date\na local government assumes regulatory authority is not required to obtain an\nadditional permit. The commissioner must forward to the local government a copy\nof the interim permit. If an application for an interim permit has been\nsubmitted to the department and a decision has not been made at the time a\nlocal government assumes regulatory authority, the department retains\nregulatory authority over that application. The commissioner must consult with\nthe local government prior to making a decision on the application. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
