(2)\n\nThe term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and include every spring, pond (other than the artificial reservoirs and filter basins), stream, ditch, gutter or other channel of any kind the waters of which, when running whether continuously or occasionally, eventually flow or may flow into the public water supply of the village of Stamford. (3)\n\nWherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a reservoir or from a watercourse is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (c) Privies adjacent to any reservoir or watercourse. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of any reservoir or within 50 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Stamford. (2)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 300 feet of any reservoir or within 100 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Stamford.
