  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2104.4 - Proceedings for eviction with certificate\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No tenant shall be removed or evicted on\ngrounds other than those stated in section\n2104.2\nof this Part unless on\napplication of the landlord (or where the housing accommodations are located in\na structure or building owned by two or more persons not constituting a\nco-operative corporation or association, the application shall be consented to\nby all the co-owners) the administrator shall issue a certificate permitting\nthe landlord to pursue his remedies at law at the expiration of the waiting\nperiod hereinafter specified in subdivision (b) of this section. The\nadministrator may issue an order granting a certificate if the removal or\neviction meets the requirements of sections\n2104.5, 2104.6, 2104.7, 2104.8, or\n2104.9\nof this Part. The\nadministrator may also issue orders granting certificates in other cases if the\nrequested removal or eviction is not inconsistent with the purposes of the act\nor this Subchapter and would not be likely to result in the circumvention or\nevasion thereof. (b) Certificates\nissued pursuant to this section or sections\n2104.5, 2104.6, 2104.7, or\n2104.9\nof this Part shall authorize\nthe landlord to commence proceedings to remove or evict the tenant at the\nexpiration of three months from the date of issuance of the certificate by the\nadministrator. Certificates issued pursuant to section\n2104.8\nof this Part, shall\nauthorize the landlord to commence proceedings to remove or evict the tenant at\nthe expiration of six months from the date of issuance of the certificate by\nthe administrator. Where the administrator finds (1) that equivalent\naccommodations are available for rent into which the tenant can move without\nsubstantial hardship or loss, or (2) that undue hardship would result to the\nlandlord, a certificate may be issued and may authorize the landlord to pursue\nhis remedies for removal or eviction of the tenant at the expiration of a\nperiod shorter than such maximum waiting period. (c) No certificate shall be used in\nconnection with any action or proceeding to remove or evict a tenant unless\nsuch removal or eviction is sought for the purpose specified in the\ncertificate. (d) In the event that\nthe landlord's intentions or circumstances so change that the premises, possession of which is sought, will not be used for the purpose specified in\nthe certificate, the certificate shall thereupon be null and void. The landlord\nshall immediately notify the local rent administrator in writing and surrender\nthe certificate for cancellation. (e) Whenever compliance with the relocation\nrequirements of this section is directed by or required pursuant to these\nregulations as a condition for the granting of a certificate of eviction, the\nlandlord shall provide suitable relocation for the tenant at the same or lower\nrent in a closely proximate area, or in a new residential building if\nconstructed on the site, in which case suitable interim housing shall be\nprovided at no additional cost to the tenant; plus in addition to reasonable\nmoving expenses, payment of a $5,000 stipend, provided the tenant vacates on or\nbefore the vacate date required by the final order. (f) In the event a comparable housing\naccommodation is offered by the owner, a tenant may file an objection with the\nDHCR challenging the suitability of a housing accommodation offered by the\nowner for relocation with 10 days after the owner identifies the housing\naccommodation and makes it available for the tenant to inspect and consider the\nsuitability thereof. Within 30 days thereafter, the DHCR shall inspect the\nhousing accommodation, on notice to both parties, in order to determine whether\nthe offered housing accommodation is suitable. Such determination will be made\nby as promptly as practicable thereafter. In the event that the DHCR determines\nthat the housing accommodation is not suitable, the tenant shall be offered\nanother housing accommodation, and shall have 10 days after it is made\navailable by the owner for the tenant's inspection to consider its suitability. In the event that the DHCR determines that the housing accommodation is\nsuitable, the tenant shall have 15 days thereafter within which to accept the\nhousing accommodation. A tenant who refuses to accept relocation to any housing\naccommodation determined by the DHCR to be suitable shall lose the right to\nrelocation by the owner, and to receive payment of moving expenses or any\nstipend. \"Suitable housing accommodations\" shall mean housing accommodations\nwhich are similar in size and features to the respective housing accommodations\nnow occupied by the tenant. Such housing accommodations shall be freshly\npainted before the tenant takes occupancy and shall be provided with\nsubstantially the same essential services and equipment the tenants received in\ntheir prior housing accommodations. The building containing such housing\naccommodations shall be free from violations of law recorded by the local\nagency having jurisdiction, which constitute fire hazards or conditions\ndangerous or detrimental to life or health, or which affect the maintenance of\nessential services. The DHCR will consider housing accommodations proposed for\nrelocation which are not presently subject to rent regulation, provided the\nowner submits a contractual agreement that places the tenant in a substantially\nsimilar housing accommodations at no additional rent for a period of six years, unless the tenant requests a shorter period in writing. (g) Where an owner provides relocation of a\ntenant to a suitable housing accommodation at a rent in excess of that for the\nsubject housing accommodation, in addition to the tenant's reasonable moving\nexpenses, the owner may be required to pay the tenant a stipend equal to the\ndifference in rent, at the commencement of the occupancy by the tenant of the\nnew housing accommodation, between the subject housing accommodation and the\nhousing accommodation to which the tenant is relocated, multiplied by 72\nmonths, provided the tenant vacates on or before the vacate date required by\nthe final order. (h) Wherever a\nstipend would result in the tenant losing a subsidy or other government benefit\nwhich is income dependent, the tenant may elect to waive the stipend and have\nthe owner at his or her own expense, relocate the tenant to a suitable housing\naccommodation at the same or lower legal regulated rent in a closely proximate\narea. (i) In the event that the\ntenant dies prior to the issuance by the DHCR of a final order granting the\nowner's application, the owner shall not be required to pay such stipend to the\nestate of the deceased tenant. (j) Where the administrator's order granting the owner's application is conditioned\nupon the owner's compliance with specified terms and conditions, if such terms\nand conditions have not been complied with, or if DHCR determines that the\nowner has not proceeded in good faith, the order may be modified or\nrevoked. (k) Noncompliance by an\nowner with any term or condition of the administrator's order granting the\nowner's application may result in DHCR initiating its own enforcement\nproceeding. The DHCR shall retain jurisdiction for this purpose until all of\nthe terms and conditions in the administrator's order granting the owner's\napplication have been met and the project described in the owner's application\nhas been completed. Subsequent owners shall be bound by the terms and\nconditions of DHCR's order. This clause shall not be deemed to eliminate any\nremedy or claim that a tenant of the dwelling unit may otherwise have against\nthe owner nor eliminate any independent authority that DHCR may be able to\nexercise by law or regulation. (l) An owner's failure to comply within a reasonable time with any term or\ncondition of the administrator's order granting the owner's application or an\nowner's failure to complete the project described in the owner's application\nmay be found to be a violation of the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law and\nthe State Rent and Evictions Regulations and subject to any of the penalties\nand remedies described therein including but not limited to revocation of the\nadministrator's order granting the owner's application and DHCR's continued\njurisdiction under the Emergency Housing Rent Control Law over the building or\nany subsequent construction. Any remedies and penalties prescribed by this Code\nshall apply to and be binding against subsequent owners. (m) The provisions of this section shall\napply to all certificates issued pursuant to this Subchapter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
