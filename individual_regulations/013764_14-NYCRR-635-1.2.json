  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 §§ 635-1.2 - Intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To set forth\ngeneral quality control and administrative requirements with which a program, service or facility (as specified) funded or certified by OPWDD, must\ncomply. (b) The requirements of\nthis Part shall be in addition to any other regulation issued by the\ncommissioner (see glossary) and designated herein as applicable to a specific\nfacility class, an OPWDD funded program, or an OPWDD funded service. (c) To provide the basis for the development\nand implementation of written agency/facility (see glossary) specific\npolicies/procedures (see glossary) which shall reflect compliance with this\n\nSubpart. Such policies/procedures shall become part of the agency's/facility's\npolicy and/or procedure manual(s). Upon development, such policies/procedures\nshall be implemented and the facility shall have the responsibility for\nensuring ongoing compliance with said policies/procedures. (d) OPWDD expects ongoing compliance with\nboth principles of compliance and standards of certification included in this\n\nPart. Therefore, such compliance shall be the responsibility of the agency and\nshall be necessary for continued participation as a certified facility or\nfunding as an approved program or service. (e) The OPWDD certification process defined\nin subdivision\n635-1.2\n(g) of\nthis section is superseded by requirements in Part 619 of this Title, Certification of Facilities and Home and Community Based Services (HCBS), effective on the effective date of these regulations. (f) In every instance in this regulation, the\nterms, \"people,\" \"person/persons,\" or \"individual/individuals\" (see glossary)\nshall refer to those who have met the admission criteria for a facility and who\nhave been admitted. (g) In\nreviewing the continued eligibility of a facility for an operating certificate, OPWDD shall survey for compliance with all \"standards of certification\" herein, and any other regulatory requirements applicable to that class of operating\ncertificate. OPWDD may make inquiries into and evaluate evidence of\nnoncompliance with the \"principles of compliance\" applicable to that class of\noperating certificate. For programs or services funded by OPWDD, the OPWDD\nshall monitor for compliance with applicable \"standards of certification\" and\nmay monitor \"principles of compliance\" as a condition for continued funding. (1)\n\nPrinciples of compliance set forth the\nbasic conditions for the operation of the facility. Principles of compliance\nidentify those requirements in which the State has a substantive interest\nbecause they are the basic and necessary conditions of participation with which\na facility is to comply. (i) Principles of\ncompliance establish basic and necessary conditions with which a facility must\nbe in compliance in order to receive and maintain certification. (ii)\n\nSuch principles shall focus on\nparticular service or administrative components of a facility and/or on an\nentire certification classification. The intent of such principles is to\nclearly indicate the scope and extent of the State's interest. (iii)\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, an\nagency/facility shall have the authority to demonstrate through policies, procedures, other documents, or any means, the methods and practices it will\nutilize to establish and ensure continued compliance with such\nprinciples. (iv)\n\nThese documents\nand/or means shall be made available to, or verified by, OPWDD to assess\ncompliance and to grant initial certification. (2)\nOPWDD reserves the right to monitor\ncompliance at any time pursuant to the responsibilities of the commissioner\nunder the Mental Hygiene Law. Facilities will not be routinely examined against\nprinciples of compliance at surveys for recertification. The process whereby\nprinciples of compliance shall be reviewed and/or enforced shall be contingent\nupon the following premises: (i) A mechanism\nfor informal reconsideration or review shall be established for resolution of\ndisputed issues relative to compliance. (ii)\n\nPrinciples of compliance and standards\nof certification are written to stand independently of one another; however, standards may reflect and/or explicate concepts or requirements set forth in\nprinciples. (iii)\n\nAt the time of\ninitial certification, a facility shall be examined against the concepts and\nrequirements set forth in the principles of compliance. (iv)\n\nAfter initial certification, OPWDD shall\npresume compliance with principles of compliance unless there is an indication\nof noncompliance brought to its attention. Except in the instance of those\nsituations which pose a threat to the health and safety of the individual, noncompliance shall require more than one violation of the principle, unless\nthe situation is pervasive, systemic, or egregious. (v) Any person who has cause to question\nwhether a facility is operating in conformance with required regulations has a\nright to bring their concern to the attention of OPWDD. (vi)\n\nThe process whereby an allegation of\nnoncompliance with a principle of compliance will be handled shall take into\nconsideration the orderly collection of information, evaluation of the\ninformation, determination of an appropriate course of action, and the\nrecording of same. (vii)\n\"Survey\"\nis a term that will be used only in relation to surveyor activity directly\nlinked to determining conformity with standards of certification and other\npertinent regulations. (viii)\n\nRoutine surveys for recertification shall be based solely on the requirements\nset forth in standards of certification and any other pertinent\nregulations. (ix)\n\nThe fundamental\nfocus of surveyors when on-site at a facility for recertification purposes\nshall be to determine compliance with standards of certification. They are not\ncharged with a primary responsibility of looking for indications of\nnoncompliance in relation to principles. (x) Surveyors visiting a facility to\ndetermine compliance with standards of certification shall not \"cite\" the\nfacility for noncompliance with a principle. Whenever possible, surveyors shall\nbring additional matters of concern to the attention of the facility during the\nexit interview. (xi)\n\nThe review of\nand inquiry into concerns brought to the attention of OPWDD shall be done by\nindividuals with training to understand and apply principles of compliance from\na broad base of experience. (xii)\n\nAny reviews of inquiries shall provide for the use of experiential judgment on\nthe part of the person doing the review or inquiry. (xiii)\n\nAn inquiry into an indication of\nnoncompliance with principles of compliance shall not be viewed as or termed a\n\"survey\". (xiv)\n\nAn inquiry into an\nindication of noncompliance shall be for the purpose of OPWDD ascertaining, through the collection of information, that a facility is not conforming to the\nprinciple(s) of compliance in question. It shall not be conceived as a process\nwhereby a facility is compelled to prove compliance; rather, one whereby OPWDD\nsubstantiates that there is a violation. (xv)\n\nWhen an inquiry results in the\nvalidation of an expressed concern, the facility shall be notified of the\nfinding by way of a preliminary report. At that time the agency/facility shall\nbe given the opportunity to respond and, if considered necessary by the\nfacility, to access an informal reconsideration or review mechanism prior to\nthe issuance of a formal notification of violation of a principle(s) of\ncompliance and the request for a course of action to correct the\nviolation. (xvi)\nOPWDD shall\nprovide an equitable mechanism, whereby there shall be an informal\nreconsideration or review, whenever the facility is concerned with the\ndetermination of noncompliance or the adequacy of the agency's/facility's plan\nof corrective action. The goal of such mechanism shall be to facilitate, whenever possible, resolution of disputes. Such mechanisms shall not neutralize\nor obstruct OPWDD's ability to implement article 16 actions\n(\ni.e., suspension, revocation or limitation of an operating\ncertificate, or the imposition of penalties) at any tine subsequent to\nidentification of a violation(s). (xvii)\n\nAppropriate B/DDSO's (see glossary)\nshall be advised of actions taken relative to noncompliance issues at\nfacilities in their service areas. (3)\n\"Standards of certification\" are those\ncriteria which OPWDD specifies as necessary to be met in order for a facility\nto demonstrate that it can and does provide the appropriate environment in\nwhich to adequately address the matters of quality of care and welfare, individual rights, safety, and/or fiscal accountability. Surveys are conducted\nfor the purpose of documenting conformity with standards of certification. Such\nconformance or an acceptable plan of correction is the basis for issuing an\noperating certificate and/or renewing an operating certificate and constitutes\none of the underlying premises justifying OPWDD's continued presumption of a\nfacility's compliance with the principles of compliance. Standards of\ncertification shall be surveyed contingent upon the following premises: (i) By definition, all standards of\ncertification shall be met for a facility to be certified/recertified. Compliance with standards of certification shall include an acceptable plan of\ncorrective action. Except in the instance of those situations which pose a\nthreat to the health and safety of the person, noncompliance shall require more\nthan one violation of the standard, unless the situation is pervasive, systemic, or egregious. (ii)\n\nIn\norder to obtain initial certification, facilities shall be reviewed and\nsurveyed against both principles of compliance and standards of certification\nto assure that the facility, its program, and physical plant are in compliance\nwith the regulation. (iii)\n\nSurveys\nfor recertification will focus on determining compliance with the specified\nstandards of certification. (iv)\n\nAs\na survey for recertification focuses on standards of certification, the survey\ninstrument shall not instruct the surveyor to review any principles of\ncompliance. (v) The survey shall be\nconducted to ensure the facility's adequacy for\ncertification/recertification. (vi)\n\nSurveys, or portions thereof, shall be conducted when the persons receiving\nservices are on-site. This will enable surveyors to rely more on observation\nand conversation and less on written documentation as means of verification of\ncompliance with the standards of certification. (vii)\n\nThe interpretation of a specific\nstandard certification shall never be more restrictive than the written\nstandard. (viii)\n\nOnly paperwork\nexplicitly required by the standard of certification shall be included in the\nsurvey process. (ix)\n\nThe survey\nprocess shall be conducted with a maximum of efficiency and a minimum of\nintrusion. (x) Prior to issuance of\ninitial certification, the agency's/facility's policy and procedure manual\nshall be made available to the OPWDD Division of Quality Assurance for its\ndiscretionary review of any topics related to the principles of compliance and\nstandards of certification, as required by applicable regulation. After initial\ncertification, the agency's/facility's policy and/or procedure manual, and any\nsubsequent changes thereto, will be presumed to be compliant, unless a review\nfor cause determines that this is not so. (xi)\n\nIf the explicit condition(s) of the\nstandard of certification are met, the surveyor shall not further evaluate the\nagency's/facility's means of demonstrating compliance beyond the explicit\nconditions. (xii)\n\nIn State-owned or\n\nState-leased buildings, where physical plant deficiencies do not place persons\nin imminent danger of their health or safety, the statement of deficiency shall\nnot the noncompliance, but no plan of corrective action on the part of a\nfacility shall be required. (xiii)\n\nThe process to be followed for certification and recertification shall not\nrequire an agency/facility to implement a plan of corrective action prior to\nits approval by OPWDD. Notes\nN.Y.
