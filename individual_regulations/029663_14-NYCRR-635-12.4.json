(b) Disclosure of\npersonal and financial information. (1)\n\nPrior to the notice date (see section\n635-12.1\nof this Subpart) the\nprovider shall take such steps to obtain personal and financial information\nconcerning individuals without full Medicaid coverage as may be reasonably\nrequired to identify liable parties and to ascertain the individual's and any\nother liable parties' ability to pay for services or the individual's ability\nto obtain and maintain full Medicaid coverage. (2)\n\nHowever, when individuals or other liable\nparties have agreed to pay the full fee for the services, the provider is not\nrequired to obtain the information specified in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. In these situations, the provider may obtain such information at\nits discretion. (3)\n\nThe provider\nmay require that, during the period that an individual receives preexisting\nservices, the individual or liable party supply personal and financial\ninformation as may be reasonably required to identify liable parties and to\nascertain the individual's and any other liable parties' ability to pay for\nservices or the individual's ability to obtain and maintain full Medicaid\ncoverage. (4)\n\nThe provider shall\nrequire that, during the period an individual receives preexisting services, the individual and other liable parties notify the provider about any changes\nin liable parties, any changes in the individual's Medicaid coverage and any\nchanges that may affect the individual's eligibility for full Medicaid coverage\nand/or the individual's and other liable parties' ability to pay for\nservices. (c) Notice and schedule of fees. On or before the notice date, the provider shall give all\nindividuals receiving preexisting services and any known other liable parties\ncopies of the fee schedule for preexisting services which the individual is\nreceiving, together with a notice including a description of the obligations of\nthe provider, the individual and liable parties under the law and this\nregulation in the form and format specified by the commissioner. (d) Reduction or waiver of\nfees. (1)\n\nThe provider may reduce or\nwaive fees with prior OPWDD approval subject to the following conditions: (i) OPWDD approval for a reduction or waiver\nof fees for an individual will be based on consideration of the individual's or\nother liable parties' available income and resources, the individual's living\nsituation, and the individual's ability to meet Medicaid eligibility\nrequirements. (ii)\nOPWDD approval\nfor a reduction or waiver of fees is only available when the individual has\ntaken all necessary steps to obtain and maintain full Medicaid coverage. However, OPWDD may approve a reduction or waiver of fees for Medicaid service\ncoordination (MSC) for up to three months if an individual does not have full\n\nMedicaid coverage and MSC is necessary to assist the individual in obtaining\nfull Medicaid coverage. (iii)\nOPWDD\napproval for a reduction or waiver of fees is only available when OPWDD was\npaying the full fee or part of the fee for the preexisting services on the\npreexisting compliance date (see section\n635-12.1\nof this Subpart), or when\nthe individual had full Medicaid coverage on the preexisting compliance\ndate. (iv)\n\nThe provider shall give\nthe individual and all liable parties 30 days' written notice of any changes in\nthe reduction or waiver of fees granted with prior OPWDD approval and shall\nrequire the individual and/or liable parties to agree to the full fee or new\nreduced fee or acknowledge the waiver of the fee. (2)\n\nThe provider may also waive or reduce\nfees at their discretion without the prior approval of OPWDD. However, OPWDD\npayments are not available when such waivers or reduced fees are\ngranted. (e) Application for HCBS waiver services. If the preexisting services are HCBS waiver services and\nthe individual is not already enrolled in the HCBS waiver, the provider shall\nrequire that the individual take all necessary steps to enroll in the HCBS\nwaiver by the payment start date (see section\n635-12.1\nof this Subpart), and\ntake all necessary steps to maintain HCBS waiver enrollment.
