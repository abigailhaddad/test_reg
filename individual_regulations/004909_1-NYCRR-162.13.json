The determination of the Seal of\n\nQuality grade of muenster, monterey jack and brick cheese, shall be on the\nbasis of rating (A) flavor, (B) body and texture, (C) color, (D) finish and\nappearance. The rating of each quality factor shall be established on the basis\nof characteristics present in cheese from any sample. The final grade shall be\nestablished on the basis of the lowest rating of any one of the quality\ncharacteristics. Muenster, monterey jack and brick labeled with the Seal of\n\nQuality must meet the fat and moisture standards as set forth in 1 NYCRR Part\n17, sections 17.51, 17.53 and 17.62. Seal of Quality muenster, monterey jack\nand brick shall conform to the following requirements and standards: (1)\n\nFlavor. Shall possess desirable and\npleasing flavor and odor characteristics. It may not possess bitter, whey\ntaint, sulfide, rancid and yeasty flavors to any degree. It may possess feed, acid, unclean, fruity and foreign types of flavors to a degree detectable only\nupon critical examination. Fresh cheese of this grade shall not possess any\ndetectable off flavors. (2)\n\nBody\nand texture. Cheese of this grade may be slightly weak bodied, but must have a\nsmooth texture. A sample drawn for inspection shall be reasonably close, with\nno large, connecting or ragged openings, and shall be practically free of gas\nholes or slits. (i) When cheese of this grade\nis worked, it shall breakdown to a cohesive, waxy or semi-glossy consistency\nand shall be free of pronounced rough, grain-like or mealy\nappearance. (ii)\n\nMonterey jack\ncheese of this grade shall conform to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph except\nthat it may be slightly open. (iii)\n\nMuenster and brick cheese of this grade shall conform to subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph except that it may have numerous small mechanical openings\ndistributed throughout the cheese. (iv)\n\nWhen triers are used to draw samples, plugs shall be full and unbroken. (3)\n\nColor. May be colored or uncolored, but\nif colored, it shall be uniform throughout, with the exception of orange rind\nmuenster, which may possess seaminess and waviness to a slight\ndegree. (4)\n\nFinish and appearance. Rindless. The wrapper or covering shall adequately and securely envelop the\ncheese, be neat, unbroken and fully protect the surface but may be slightly\nwrinkled. The cheese shall be free from huffing but may be slightly lopsided. There shall be no indications that mold has entered the cheese. (b) Flavor. (1)\n\nSlight. Detected only upon critical\nexamination. (2)\n\nDefinite. Not\nintense but detectable. (3)\n\nPronounced. So intense as to be easily identified. (4)\n\nFeed. Feed flavors (such as alfalfa, sweet clover, silage or similar feed) in milk carried through into the\ncheese. (5)\n\nAcid. Sharp and puckery\nto the taste, characteristics of lactic acid. (6)\n\nBitter. Distasteful, similar to taste of\nquinine. Most frequently found in aged cheese. (7)\n\nFruity. A sweet fruit-like flavoring\nresembling apples; generally increasing in intensity as the cheese\nages. (8)\n\nWhey-taint. A slightly\nacid flavor and odor characteristic of fermented whey caused by too slow\nexpulsion of whey from the curd. (9)\n\nOld milk. Lacks freshness. (10)\n\nLipase. A flavor suggestive of rancidity\nor butyric acid, sometimes associated with a bitterness. (11)\n\nSulfide. An objectionable flavor of\nhydrogen sulfide similar to the flavor of water with a high sulfur\ncontent. (12)\n\nForeign. Flavors not\nnormally associated with cheese such as contaminants. (c) Body and texture. (1)\n\nSmooth. Feels silky; not dry and coarse\nor rough. (2)\n\nReasonably firm. Somewhat less firm but not to the extent of materially injuring the keeping\nquality of the cheese. (3)\n\nOpen. Mechanical openings that are irregular in shape and are caused by workmanship\nand not gas fermentation. (4)\n\nSweet\nholes. Spherical gas holes, glossy in appearance; usually about the size of BB\nshots; also referred to as shot or Swiss holes. (5)\n\nWeak. Requires little pressure to crush, is soft but is not necessarily sticky like a pasty cheese. (6)\n\nPasty. Usually weak body and when the\ncheese is rubbed between the thumb and fingers it becomes sticky and\nsmeary. (7)\n\nCrumbly. Loosely knit\nand tends to fall apart when rubbed between the thumb and fingers. (8)\n\nGassy. Gas holes of various sizes and may\nbe scattered. (9)\n\nPinny. Numerous\nvery small gas holes. (10)\n\nPractically free of gas. Limited gas or sweet holes are acceptable, provided\nthat the body and flavor meets the flavor requirements of these\nspecifications. (11)\n\nSlits. Narrow\nor elongated openings generally associated with cheese that is gassy or\nyeasty. (d) Color. (1)\n\nUncolored. Absence of artificial\ncoloring. (2)\n\nSeamy. White\nthread-like lines that form if the pieces of curd are not properly joined\ntogether. (3)\n\nWavy. Unevenness of\ncolor which appears as layers or waves. (4)\n\nAcid cut. Bleached or faded appearance\nwhich sometimes varies throughout the cheese, appearing most often around\nmechanical openings. (e) Finish and appearance. (1)\n\nWrapper or\ncovering. Transparent or opaque material (plastic film type or foil) next to\nthe surface of the cheese, used as an enclosure or covering of the\ncheese. (2)\n\nAdequately and securely\nenveloped.

Mold\nspots or areas that have formed under the wrapper or on the cheese. (9)\n\nRough surface. Lacks\nsmoothness. (10)\n\nLopsided. One side\nof the cheese is higher than the other side. (11)\n\nHigh edge. A rim or ridge on the\nfollower side of the cheese, which is raised in varying degrees. In extreme\ncases it may bend over. (12)\n\nSoft\nspots. Soft to the touch and the spots are usually faded and moist. (13)\n\nHuffed cheese. Swollen because of gas\nfermentation. The cheese becomes rounded or oval in shape instead of being\nflat. (f) Packaging. Rindless. Cheese which has not formed a rind due to the impervious type of\nwrapper, covering or container, enclosing the cheese or by any other means of\nhandling. (g) Processing facility. Seal of Quality cheese manufacturing and packaging is restricted to those\nfacilities in compliance with Agriculture and Markets Law, article 4 or 12-A\nand these facilities must maintain a satisfactory inspection record.
