  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1627-2.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Aggregate\nannual income is sum of all income received by one person during a 12-month\nperiod. The total of all such income received by all members of family, both\nadult and minor, is aggregate annual family income. (b) The word anticipated when used in\nconnection with annual income refers to income expected to be received during\ncoming 12 months from date income is reported. It is the projection over a\n12-month period, of income being currently received, with any adjustments\nthereto as indicated by prior annual income, nature of employment and similar\nfactors. (c) Assets are cash or\nother property readily convertible to cash owned by an applicant or tenant or\nmember of his household. The local housing authority should ascertain that\ntotal of such assets does not exceed maximum amount of assets permitted for\nadmission or continued occupancy. (d) Chief wage earner is person who is\nlegally or morally responsible for dependents in household, whose income is\ngenerally from employment or self-employment and usually exceeds income of any\nother adult member of household. However, any question as to determination of\nchief wage earner should be resolved, if possible, on basis of affording\nadvantage to applicant or tenant as to admission or continued occupancy\nlimits. (e) Deductions are amounts\nadministratively determined and approved by Commissioner of Housing as proper\nexclusions in determination of aggregate annual income. (f) Effective date of rent change is one of\nthe following dates, as applicable: (1)\n\nFor\nannual income re-examinations under either policy of rent adjustment, rent\nadjustments, both increases and decreases, will be effective on first day of\nfirst month of calendar quarter following quarter in which annual income\nre-examination was scheduled except that, in case of rent decrease, information\nmust first be verified. If such verification has not been received by above\ndate, effective date will be first day of month in which verification is\nreceived. (2)\n\nFor quarterly income\nreviews, and on occasion of any change under interim rent adjustment policy and\nunder noninterim rent adjustment policy, rent increase will be effective on\nfirst day of month following 30 calendar days from date of change if change is\nreported within 15 days of its occurrence. If change is not reported within 15\ndays, rent increase will be effective on first day of month in which change\noccurred, with a retroactive charge being assessed if necessary. (3)\n\nRent decreases in all cases listed under\nparagraph (2) above will be effective on first day of month in which\nverification of reported change is obtained. It is the responsibility of the\nauthority to be prompt in requesting verification of reported\nchanges. (g) Exemptions\nare amounts of certain income permitted by law to be deducted from \"aggregate\nannual income\". (h) Fixed income is\nincome where factors influencing it are of a regular nature so that tenant's\nincome can be anticipated for a 12-month period with a reasonable degree of\naccuracy. (i) Income is that\nrecurrent gain or benefit, measured in money which proceeds to a person from\nany source, although usually from his labor, business or property. See also, lump sum additions to assets, subdivision (l) below. (j) Income of minors is income accruing to a\nminor as a result of his employment or payments in lieu of employment, such as\nunemployment insurance benefits, and also any other payments made for benefit\nof minor but not available for use of family or support of minor. Income\navailable for support of minor or for family use, whether paid to parents or to\nminor, will be considered as family income and will not be\ndeductible. (k) Interim rent\nadjustment policy is that policy whereby rent charges are adjusted at any time\na change in income or family composition occurs which effects rent\ndetermination. Such policy requires tenants to advise of any change within 15\ndays of its occurrence and in addition, to submit requested information at time\nof annual income reexamination. (See also subd. [o] below, noninterim rent\nadjustment policy.) This policy requires an authority to conduct annual income\nre-examination of all tenants. It also requires an authority to conduct\nquarterly income reviews of all tenants with nonfixed income. An authority may\nalso conduct quarterly income reviews of all or any portion of its tenants with\nfixed income, if it so desires. (l) Lump sum addition to assets is a nonrecurrent gain or benefit proceeding to a\nperson; for example, payments on insurance claims, capital gains, settlements\nfor personal or property losses and casual or irregular gifts. Such additions\nare not included in income. (m) Net\nannual income and net annual family income are aggregate incomes less\nexemptions and authorized deductions. (n) Nonfixed income is income where factors\ninfluencing it, such as rate of pay, number of hours of work per week, number\nof weeks worked per year, present no pattern of regularity, making it difficult\nto project for other than short periods of time. (o) Noninterim rent adjustment policy. (1)\n\nIs that policy whereby rent charges are\nadjusted only at time of annual income reexamination or on occasion of change\ndue to one of the following conditions: (i) Tenant or member of family is placed upon or removed from public assistance by\ndepartment of welfare. (ii)\n\nMember\nof tenant's family starts permanent full time employment; full time employed\nperson permanently joins family; full time employed person permanently leaves\nfamily. (iii)\n\nWhen a full time\nemployed member of the tenant's family becomes unemployed for one full calendar\nmonth or more; and when such member is subsequently re-employed. (2)\n\nThis policy requires tenant to\nsubmit requested information at time of annual income re-examination and to\nadvise of any of the above listed changes within 15 days of their occurrence. It requires the authority to conduct an annual income re-examination of all\ntenants. Note: Interim rent adjustment policy (see subd. [k]\nabove) and noninterim rent adjustment policy are alternate policies; only one\nof these policies may be adopted by an authority. (p) The word prior when used in connection\nwith annual income refers to income received during 12-month period immediately\npreceding time income is reported. Prior annual income is considered as a\nbasis, where indicated, for projecting income expected to be received during\ncoming 12 months. It is also basis for assessing retroactive surcharges where\nsuch prior annual income grossly exceeds income anticipated for that period and\nsuch difference is directly attributable to tenant's neglect or\nmisrepresentation. (q) Secondary\nwage earner is any gainfully employed, adult member of the household other than\nthe chief wage earner. It is not necessary for the chief wage earner to be\ngainfully employed for another household member to qualify as a secondary wage\nearner. (See definition of chief wage earner, subdivision [d] of this\nsection.)\n(r) Vietnam veterans are\npersons who\n(1)\nhave served in the armed\nforces of the United States for a period of at least six months (or any shorter\nperiod which terminated due to death or injury incurred in such service), provided some portion of the period of service was between August 5, 1964 and\n\nMay 7, 1975, the official date of the termination of the conflict in Vietnam; and\n(2)\nhave been thereafter\ndischarged or released therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable, or\ndied in such service, not more than five years prior to the time of application\nfor admission.
