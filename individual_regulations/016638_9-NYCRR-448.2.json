  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 448.2 - Aids to navigation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Lateral system. Prior to establishing a lateral system of marking on any\nwaterway, a base or outlet and a source or head of navigation shall be first\nestablished thereon. Upon waters which have no singular inlet or outlet, arbitrary assumptions may be made to establish one location as the base or\noutlet and another as the source or head of navigation. (b) Starboard side. When proceeding from the\nbase or outlet towards the source or head of navigation, red navigation aids\nshall mark the starboard or right side of the channel, and boats proceeding\ntowards the head of navigation shall keep such aids on their starboard or right\nside. All such navigation aids shall conform to the following general\nspecifications: (1)\n\nColor. Signal\nred. (2)\n\nNumbering. Starting at the\nbase or outlet and ending at the head or inlet, even-numbered buoys only shall\nbe used to mark the right or starboard side of the channel, and from such\nstarting point shall advance in even numerical progression to the source or\nhead of navigation. Numbering requirements shall be at the discretion of the\ncommissioner. (3)\n\nLighting. Red\nflashing lights may be installed and shall conform to light characteristics as\nspecified by the commissioner depending upon the location of the navigation\naid. Unlighted aids shall be equipped with red reflective material on the\nuppermost part of the aid. The type and extent of reflective material must be\napproved by the commissioner. (4)\n\nShape. Spar, conical (nun), pillar or structural shapes may be used. (5)\n\nConstruction. Types of construction shall\nbe approved on an individual basis considering the location of the aid and\nother factors. (c) Port\nside. When proceeding from the base or outlet towards the source or head of\nnavigation, green navigation aids shall mark the port or left side of the\nchannel, and boats proceeding toward the head of navigation shall keep such\naids on their port or left side. All such navigation aids shall conform to the\nfollowing specifications: (1)\n\nColor. Green. (2)\n\nNumbering. Starting at\nthe base or outlet and ending at the head or inlet, odd-numbered buoys only\nshall be used to mark the left or port side of the channel, and from such\nstarting point shall advance in odd numerical progression to the source or head\nof navigation. Numbering requirements shall be at the discretion of the\ncommissioner. (3)\n\nLighting. Flashing green lights may be installed and shall conform to light\ncharacteristics as specified by the commissioner depending upon the location of\nthe navigation aid. Unlighted aids shall be equipped with green reflective\nmaterial on the uppermost part of the aid. The type and extent of reflective\nmaterial must be approved by the commissioner. (4)\n\nShape. Spar, can, pillar or structural\nshapes may be used. (5)\n\nConstruction. Types of construction shall be approved on an individual basis\nconsidering the location of the aid and other factors. (d) Federal lateral system. The State\nnavigation aid system may be further supplemented by the use of aids included\nin the Federal lateral system, such as midchannel and junction buoys. When such\nadditional aids are used, they shall have the same significance as established\nin the Federal lateral system of buoyage. Aids placed on navigable waters of\nthe United States shall be in accord with current Federal\nregulations. (e) General\nobstruction marker. A general obstruction marker shall have no lateral\nsignificance and may be used in place of, or in addition to, the aids in the\nlateral system. This aid may be used to mark obstructions projecting from shore\nor wherever found in otherwise navigable waters. When this aid is located near\nshore, boats shall not pass between the aid and the shore. One or more aids\nshall be used to mark obstructions which are not in close proximity to shore, or where navigable channels exist between the obstruction and the shore, depending upon the size and character of the obstruction. In every case, there\nshall be a sufficient number of aids installed to accurately indicate the\nextent of the obstruction. Boats shall stay clear of areas in which these aids\nare installed, and shall not pass between such navigation aids when they are\nlocated close together. General obstruction markers shall conform to the\nfollowing specifications: (1)\n\nShape. Can, at\nleast 1 1/2 feet from waterline to top of buoy if floating, or if can is fixed\non a stanchion, it must be at least one foot in height. (2)\n\nColor. The upper one fourth of the aid\nand the lower one fourth of the aid shall be international orange in color. The\nbottom stripe of orange shall show at least three inches above the waterline. The center section shall be white. (3)\n\nLighting. Flashing white lights may be\ninstalled and shall conform to light characteristics as specified by the\ncommissioner, depending upon the location of the navigation aid and other\nfactors. Unlighted aids shall be equipped with orange reflective material on\nthe uppermost part of the aid. The type and extent of reflective material must\nbe approved by the commissioner. (4)\n\nSymbol. In the center of the white\nsection, equally spaced, on not less than two sides of the buoy, there shall be\na symbol in the shape of a diamond, to be of a good proportion and to cover an\narea of at least three fourths of the height of the white section. The symbol\nshall be at least one inch in thickness and painted international orange in\ncolor and, in the center thereof, running horizontally, there shall be printed\nin block form the word DANGER. The letters shall be black in color, and of good\nproportion in relation to the size of the symbol. (5)\n\nNumbering. Since this aid has no lateral\nsignificance, no numbering is permitted. However, a letter, or a combination of\nletters may be used to identify the location of the aid on a chart. (6)\n\nConstruction. Types of construction shall\nbe approved on an individual basis, considering the location of the aid and\nother factors. (f) Supplementary obstruction markers may be used to enhance the effectiveness of\none or more general obstruction markers. Supplementary obstruction markers\nshall conform to the following specifications: (1)\n\nShape. Spar or cylindrical, at least 1\n1/2 feet from waterline to top of buoy if floating, or if spar or cylinder is\nfixed on a stanchion, it must be at least one foot in height and the bottom of\nthe shape at least three feet above the waterline. (2)\n\nColor. White with two-inch wide\nhorizontal international orange stripes showing six inches of white in between\nsuch orange stripes, and showing at least two of such stripes above the\nwaterline. (3)\n\nLighting. Lighting\nand/or reflective material shall conform to the rules and regulations for\ngeneral obstruction markers, paragraph (e)(3) of this section. (4)\n\nSymbol. No symbol is required, but if a\nsymbol is used it shall conform to the rules and regulations for general\nobstruction markers, paragraph (e)(4) of this section. (5)\n\nNumbering. Same as general obstruction\nmarkers, paragraph (e)(5) of this section. (6)\n\nConstruction. Same as general obstruction\nmarkers, paragraph (e)(6) of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n448.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
