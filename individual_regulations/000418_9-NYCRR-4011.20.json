  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4011.20 - Exacta\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The object of\nthe exacta is to select in order the first and second place finisher in the\ndesignated exacta race. The exacta pool shall be held entirely separate from\nall other pools and is in no way a part of the daily double, or win, place or\nshow pools. (b) Races in which\nexacta betting shall be conducted shall be approved by the\ncommission. (c) If a horse is\nscratched or excused from racing no further tickets shall be sold designating\nsuch horse and all tickets previously sold designating such horse shall be\nrefunded and the money deducted from the gross pool. Coupled entries or fields\nshall be governed by section\n4009.20\nof this Title. (d) Dead heat. (1)\n\nIn the event of a dead heat for win, the\nnet pool shall be distributed to each combination of winners separately as in a\nwin pool dead heat, e.g., in a dead heat of two horses there are two winning\ncombinations, in a dead heat of three horses there are six winning\ncombinations. (2)\n\nIn the event of a\ndead heat for second, the net pool shall be divided as in a win pool dead heat\namong holders of tickets combining the winner with each second place\nhorse. (e) Winning\ncombination. The numbers of the first two horses as made official shall be the\nwinning combination except that where more than one of such horses is part of a\ncoupled entry or field with another of such horses only the best finisher of\nsuch horses shall be counted in the winning combination for payoff, and the\nhorse or horses not in such coupled entry or field finishing the same, or, if\napplicable, next finishing, shall be the other part of the winning exacta\ncombination. For example, if two horses in a coupled entry (or field): (1)\nfinish first and second, or in a dead\nheat for first, the winning combination will be the number of such entry or\nfield and the number of the third finishing horse not part of such entry or\nfield; (2)\nfinish first and in a\ndead heat for second, the winning combination will be the number of such entry\nor field and the number of the horse dead heated for second who is not part of\nsuch coupled entry or field; or\n(3)\nfinish in a three-horse dead heat for win with another horse not part of such\nentry or field, the winning combination will be the number of such entry and\nthe number of the horse not part of such entry. (f) In the event fewer than four betting\ninterests start, the exacta shall be declared off and the gross pool\nrefunded. (g) Failure to select a\nwinning combination. If no exacta ticket is sold combining the winner and\nsecond place horse in order, the net pool shall be distributed to holders of\nexacta tickets designating the winner to win. In the event one horse only\nfinishes and is declared winner, the net pool shall be distributed to holders\nof exacta tickets designating the winner to win. Should these circumstances be\nforeseeable when a pool is closed, an immediate announcement shall be made to\nhold all tickets because all combinations are not covered. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
