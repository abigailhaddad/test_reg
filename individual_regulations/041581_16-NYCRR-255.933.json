  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.933 - Addressing integrity issues\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General requirements. An operator must take prompt action to address all\nanomalous conditions that the operator discovers through the integrity\nassessment. In addressing all conditions, an operator must evaluate all\nanomalous conditions and remediate those that could reduce a pipeline's\nintegrity. An operator must be able to demonstrate that the remediation of the\ncondition will ensure that the condition is unlikely to pose a threat to the\nintegrity of the pipeline until the next reassessment of the covered segment. If an operator is unable to respond within the time limits for certain\nconditions specified in this section, the operator must temporarily reduce the\noperating pressure of the pipeline or take other action that ensures the safety\nof the covered segment. If pressure is reduced, an operator must determine the\ntemporary reduction in operating pressure using ASME/ANSI B31G (as described in\nsection\n10.3\nof this Title) or AGA\nPipeline Research Committee Project PR-3- 805 (\"RSTRENG\"; as described in\nsection\n10.3\nof this Title) or reduce the\noperating pressure to a level not exceeding 80 percent of the level at the time\nthe condition was discovered. A reduction in operating pressure cannot exceed\n365 days without an operator providing a technical justification that the\ncontinued pressure restriction will not jeopardize the integrity of the\npipeline. (b) Discovery of\ncondition. Discovery of a condition occurs when an operator has adequate\ninformation about a condition to determine that the condition presents a\npotential threat to the integrity of the pipeline. A condition that presents a\npotential threat includes, but is not limited to, those conditions that require\nremediation or monitoring listed under paragraphs (d)(1) through (3) of this\nsection. An operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after conducting\nan integrity assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to\nmake that determination, unless the operator demonstrates that the 180-day\nperiod is impracticable. (c) Schedule for evaluation and remediation. An operator must complete remediation\nof a condition according to a schedule that prioritizes the conditions for\nevaluation and remediation. Unless a special requirement for remediating\ncertain conditions applies, as provided in subdivision (d) of this section, an\noperator must follow the schedule in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title), section 7, Figure 4. If an operator cannot meet the schedule for any condition, the\noperator must justify the reasons why it cannot meet the schedule and that the\nchanged schedule will not jeopardize public safety. An operator must notify the\ndepartment and OPS in accordance with section\n255.949\nof this Part if it cannot\nmeet the schedule and cannot provide safety through a temporary reduction in\noperating pressure or other action. (d) Special requirements for scheduling\nremediation. (1)\n\nImmediate repair conditions. An operator's evaluation and remediation schedule must follow ASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 7 in providing for immediate repair conditions. To maintain safety, an\noperator must temporarily reduce operating pressure in accordance with\nsubdivision (a) of this section or shut down the pipeline until the operator\ncompletes the repair of these conditions. An operator must treat the following\nconditions as immediate repair conditions: (i) a calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows a predicted failure\npressure less than or equal to 1.1 times the maximum allowable operating\npressure at the location of the anomaly. Suitable remaining strength\ncalculation methods include, ASME/ANSI B31G; RSTRENG; or an alternative\nequivalent method of remaining strength calculation. These documents are\nincorporated by reference and available at the addresses listed in section\n10.3\nof this Title; (ii)\na dent that has any indication of metal\nloss, cracking or a stress riser; (iii)\nan indication or anomaly that in the\njudgment of the person designated by the operator to evaluate the assessment\nresults requires immediate action. (2)\n\nOne-year conditions. Except for\nconditions listed in paragraphs (1) and (3) of this subdivision, an operator\nmust remediate any of the following within one year of discovery of the\ncondition: (i) A smooth dent located between\nthe 8 o'clock and 4 o'clock positions (upper 2/3 of the pipe) with a depth\ngreater than six percent of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.50 inch [13\nmillimeters] in depth for a pipeline diameter less than Nominal Pipe Size [NPS]\n12). (ii)\nA dent with a depth\ngreater than a two percent of the pipeline's diameter (0.250 [6 millimeters]\ninch in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that affects pipe\ncurvature at a girth weld or at a longitudinal seam weld. (3)\n\nMonitored conditions. An operator does\nnot have to schedule the following conditions for remediation, but must record\nand monitor the conditions during subsequent risk assessments and integrity\nassessments for any change that may require remediation: (i) A dent with a depth greater than six\npercent of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.50 inch [13 millimeters] in\ndepth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) located between the 4 o'clock\nposition and the 8 o'clock position (bottom 1/3 of the pipe). (ii)\nA dent located between the 8 o'clock and\n4 o'clock positions (upper 2/3 of the pipe) with a depth greater than six\npercent of the pipeline diameter (greater than 0.50 inch [13 millimeters] in\ndepth for a pipeline diameter less than nominal/pipe/size [NPS] 12), and\nengineering analyses of the dent demonstrate critical strain levels are not\nexceeded. (iii)\nA dent with a depth\ngreater than two percent of the pipeline's diameter (0.250 inch [6 millimeters]\ndepth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that affects pipe curvature at\na girth weld or a longitudinal seam weld, and engineering analyses of the dent\nand girth or seam weld demonstrate critical strain levels are not exceeded. These analyses must consider weld properties. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.933\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
