  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.631 - Control room management\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nThis section applies to each\noperator of a pipeline facility with a controller working in a control room who\nmonitors and controls all or part of a pipeline facility through a SCADA\nsystem. Each operator must have and follow written control room management\nprocedures that implement the requirements of this section, except that for\neach control room where an operator's activities are limited to either or both\nof: (i) distribution with less than 250,000\nservices; or\n(ii)\ntransmission\nwithout a compressor station, the operator must have and follow written\nprocedures that implement only subdivisions (d) (regarding fatigue) and (i)\n(regarding compliance and deviations) of this section. (2)\n\nThe procedures required by this section\nmust be integrated, as appropriate, with operating and emergency procedures\nrequired by sections 255.605 and\n255.615\nof this Part. An operator\nmust develop the procedures no later than August 1, 2011 and must implement the\nprocedures according to the following schedule. The procedures required by\nsubdivision (b), paragraphs (c)(5), (d)(2) and (d)(3), and subdivisions (f) and\n(g) of this section must be implemented no later than October 1, 2011. The\nprocedures required by paragraphs (c)(1) through (4), (d)(1), (4), and\nsubdivision (e) of this section must be implemented no later than August 1, 2012. The training procedures required by subdivision (h) of this section must\nbe implemented no later than August 1, 2012, except that any training required\nby another subdivision of this section must be implemented no later than the\ndeadline for that subdivision. (b) Roles and responsibilities. Each operator\nmust define the roles and responsibilities of a controller during normal, abnormal, and emergency operating conditions. To provide for a controller's\nprompt and appropriate response to operating conditions, an operator must\ndefine each of the following: (1)\na\ncontroller's authority and responsibility to make decisions and take actions\nduring normal operations; (2)\na\ncontroller's role when an abnormal operating condition is detected, even if the\ncontroller is not the first to detect the condition, including the controller's\nresponsibility to take specific actions and to communicate with\nothers; (3)\na controller's role\nduring an emergency, even if the controller is not the first to detect the\nemergency, including the controller's responsibility to take specific actions\nand to communicate with others; and\n(4)\na method of recording controller\nshift-changes and any hand- over of responsibility between\ncontrollers. (c) Provide\nadequate information. Each operator must provide its controllers with the\ninformation, tools, processes and procedures necessary for the controllers to\ncarry out the roles and responsibilities the operator has defined by performing\neach of the following: (1)\nimplement sections\n1, 4, 8, 9, 11.1, and 11.3 of API RP 1165 (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title), whenever a\nSCADA system is added, expanded or replaced, unless the operator demonstrates\nthat certain provisions of sections 1, 4, 8, 9, 11.1, and 11.3 of API RP 1165\nare not practical for the SCADA system used; (2)\nconduct a point-to-point verification\nbetween SCADA displays and related field equipment when field equipment is\nadded or moved and when other changes that affect pipeline safety are made to\nfield equipment or SCADA displays; (3)\ntest and verify an internal communication\nplan to provide adequate means for manual operation of the pipeline safely, at\nleast once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15\nmonths; (4)\ntest any backup SCADA\nsystems at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15\nmonths; and\n(5)\nestablish and\nimplement procedures for when a different controller assumes responsibility, including the content of information to be exchanged. (d) Fatigue mitigation. Each operator must\nimplement the following methods to reduce the risk associated with controller\nfatigue that could inhibit a controller's ability to carry out the roles and\nresponsibilities the operator has defined: (1)\nestablish shift lengths and schedule rotations that provide controllers\noff-duty time sufficient to achieve eight hours of continuous sleep; (2)\neducate controllers and supervisors in\nfatigue mitigation strategies and how off-duty activities contribute to\nfatigue; (3)\ntrain controllers and\nsupervisors to recognize the effects of fatigue; and\n(4)\nestablish a maximum limit on controller\nhours-of-service, which may provide for an emergency deviation from the maximum\nlimit if necessary for the safe operation of a pipeline facility. (e) Alarm management. Each\noperator using a SCADA system must have a written alarm management plan to\nprovide for effective controller response to alarms. An operator's plan must\ninclude provisions to: (1)\nreview SCADA\nsafety-related alarm operations using a process that ensures alarms are\naccurate and support safe pipeline operations; (2)\nidentify at least once each calendar\nmonth points affecting safety that have been taken off scan in the SCADA host, have had alarms inhibited, generated false alarms, or that have had forced or\nmanual values for periods of time exceeding that required for associated\nmaintenance or operating activities; (3)\nverify the correct safety-related alarm\nset-point values and alarm descriptions at least once each calendar year, but\nat intervals not to exceed 15 months; (4)\nreview the alarm management plan required\nby this paragraph at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not\nexceeding 15 months, to determine the effectiveness of the plan; (5)\nmonitor the content and volume of general\nactivity being directed to and required of each controller at least once each\ncalendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months, that will assure\ncontrollers have sufficient time to analyze and react to incoming alarms; and\n(6)\naddress deficiencies\nidentified through the implementation of paragraphs (1) through (5) of this\nsubdivision. (f) Change\nmanagement. Each operator must assure that changes that could affect control\nroom operations are coordinated with the control room personnel by performing\neach of the following: (1)\nestablish\ncommunications between control room representatives, operator's management, and\nassociated field personnel when planning and implementing physical changes to\npipeline equipment or configuration; (2)\nrequire its field personnel to contact\nthe control room when emergency conditions exist and when making field changes\nthat affect control room operations; and\n(3)\nseek control room or control room\nmanagement participation in planning prior to implementation of significant\npipeline hydraulic or configuration changes. (g) Operating experience. Each operator must\nassure that lessons learned from its operating experience are incorporated, as\nappropriate, into its control room management procedures by performing each of\nthe following: (1)\n\nReview incidents that must\nbe reported pursuant to 49 CFR part\n191\nto determine if control room actions\ncontributed to the event and, if so, correct, where necessary, deficiencies\nrelated to: (i) controller fatigue; (ii)\nfield equipment; (iii)\nthe operation of any relief\ndevice; (iv)\nprocedures; (v) SCADA system configuration; and\n(vi)\nSCADA system performance. (2)\n\nInclude lessons learned from\nthe operator's experience in the training program required by this\nsection. (h) Training. Each operator must establish a controller training program and review the\ntraining program content to identify potential improvements at least once each\ncalendar year, but at intervals not to exceed 15 months. An operator's program\nmust provide for training each controller to carry out the roles and\nresponsibilities defined by the operator. In addition, the training program\nmust include the following elements: (1)\nresponding to abnormal operating conditions likely to occur simultaneously or\nin sequence; (2)\nuse of a\ncomputerized simulator or non-computerized (tabletop) method for training\ncontrollers to recognize abnormal operating conditions; (3)\ntraining controllers on their\nresponsibilities for communication under the operator's emergency response\nprocedures; (4)\ntraining that will\nprovide a controller a working knowledge of the pipeline system, especially\nduring the development of abnormal operating conditions; and\n(5)\nfor pipeline operating setups that are\nperiodically, but infrequently used, providing an opportunity for controllers\nto review relevant procedures in advance of their application. (i) Compliance and deviations. An\noperator must maintain for review during inspection: (1)\nrecords that demonstrate compliance with\nthe requirements of this section; and\n(2)\ndocumentation to demonstrate that any\ndeviation from the procedures required by this section was necessary for the\nsafe operation of a pipeline facility.
