Tit. 8 § 2404.3 - Application for reinstatement\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn institution, against which a final adverse decision has\nbeen issued under this Part, may at any time request reinstatement of its full\neligibility and may submit to the president such material as it wishes, or as\nthe president requests, to demonstrate that the basis for such decision has\nbeen remedied and is unlikely to recur. The president shall respond to such\nrequest within 30 days and, if he denies the request, shall provide reasons for\nsuch denial. An institution whose request has been denied shall be given an\nopportunity to show cause why such request should not be denied. However, the\npresident need not consider a request to remove a limitation, or grant an\nopportunity to show cause, if such request is submitted within six months of a\nprevious denial. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8\n§\n2404.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
