  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 §§ 1100-8.3 - Public comment hearing and issues determination\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Public comment hearing. (1)\n\nNot less than sixty (60) days from the\ndate of issuance of the combined notice required by section 1100-8.2(d) of this\n\nPart, a public comment hearing shall be convened to hear and receive the\nunsworn statements of parties and non-parties relating to the siting permit\napplication. A stenographic transcript of such statements shall be made but\nshall not be part of the record of the hearing, as defined by section 1100-8.11\nof this Part. (2)\n\nThe ALJ may\nrequire that lengthy statements be submitted in writing and summarized for oral\npresentation. (3)\n\nThe statements\nmade at the public comment hearing shall not constitute evidence, but may be\nused by the ALJ as a basis to inquire further of the parties and potential\nparties at the issues determination stage. (b) Issues determination. (1)\n\nIn the combined notice required by\nsection 1100-8.2(d) of this part, the mandatory parties identified in section\n1100-8.4(b) and any potential parties shall be provided with the opportunity to\nfile papers concerning potential substantive and significant issues, which\nshall be determined in advance of the adjudicatory hearing. The issues\ndetermination procedure shall be conducted solely on papers, unless the ALJ, in\ntheir sole discretion, determines that oral argument is necessary to fully\nunderstand the issues proposed by the parties and potential parties. At the\nALJ's discretion, an issues determination may be revisited at any time prior to\nthe issuance of a final decision in order to consider issues based on new\ninformation upon a showing that such information was not reasonably available\nat the time of the issues determination. Upon a demonstration that the public\nreview period for the application prior to the issues determination was\ninsufficient to allow potential parties to adequately prepare for the issues\ndetermination procedure, the ALJ may adjourn the issues determination, extend\nthe time for written submittals or make some other fair and equitable provision\nto protect the rights of the potential parties. (2)\n\nThe purpose of the issues determination\nprocedure is: (i) To receive argument on\nwhether party status should be granted to any petitioner; (ii)\n\nTo narrow or resolve disputed issues of\nfact without resort to taking testimony; (iii)\n\nTo receive argument on whether disputed\nissues of fact that are not resolved meet the standards for adjudicable issues\nset forth in subdivision (c) of this section; (iv)\n\nTo determine whether legal issues exist\nwhose resolution is not dependent on facts that are in substantial dispute and, if so, to receive argument on the merits of those issues; and\n(v) To decide any pending motions. (3)\n\nThe ALJ shall preside over the\nissues determination procedure. Participants shall include Office Staff, staff\nfrom other involved State agencies, the applicant, and any person who has filed\na petition for party status pursuant to section 1100-8.4(c) of this\n\nPart. (4)\n\nWithin fifteen (15) days\nafter the close of the public comment period, the filing of petitions for party\nstatus, or the filing of a statement of compliance with local laws and\nregulations, whichever event occurs later: (i) Office Staff may file and serve a response to any petitions for party status, any statement of issues by applicant, and the statement of compliance with\nlocal laws and regulations. (ii)\n\nThe applicant may file and serve a response to any petition for party status or\nstatement of compliance with local laws and regulations. In addition, the\napplicant shall file and serve on Office Staff a response to public comments\nreceived during the public comment period, including any supplemental\ninformation. (5)\n\nIn no\nevent later than thirty (30) days after the date of receipt of written\nsubmissions for issues determination and responses thereto, the ALJ shall: (i) Determine which persons will be granted\nparty status; (ii)\n\nDetermine which\nissues satisfy the requirements for being adjudicable issues as set forth in\nsubdivision (c) of this section, and define those issues as precisely as\npossible; (iii)\n\nRule on the merits\nof any legal issue where ruling does not depend on the resolution of disputed\nissues of fact; (iv)\n\nDecide any\npending motions to the extent practicable; and\n(v) Summarize comments received on the\napplication and draft permit conditions or intent to deny. (c) Standards\nfor adjudicable issues. (1)\n\nGenerally applicable rules. Subject to the limitations set\nforth in paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subdivision, an issue is adjudicable\nif: (i) It relates to a substantive and\nsignificant dispute between Office Staff and the applicant over a proposed term\nor condition of the draft siting permit, including uniform standards and\nconditions; (ii)\n\nPublic comments, including comments provided by a municipality, on a draft siting permit\ncondition published by the Office raise a substantive and significant\nissue; (iii)\n\nIt relates to a matter\ncited by Office Staff as a basis to deny the siting permit and is contested by\nthe applicant; or\n(iv)\n\nIt is\nproposed by a potential party and is both substantive and\nsignificant. (2)\n\nAn issue\nis substantive if there is sufficient doubt about the applicant's ability to\nmeet statutory or regulatory criteria applicable to the project, such that a\nreasonable person would require further inquiry. In determining whether such a\ndemonstration has been made, the ALJ shall consider the proposed issue in light\nof the application and related documents, the standards and conditions, or\nsiting permit, the statement of issues filed by the applicant, the content of\nany petitions filed for party status, the record of the issues determination\nand any subsequent written or oral arguments authorized by the ALJ. (3)\n\nAn issue is significant if it has the\npotential to result in the denial of a siting permit, a major modification to\nthe proposed project or the imposition of significant permit conditions in\naddition to those proposed in the draft permit, including uniform standards and\nconditions. (4)\n\nIn situations where\n\nOffice Staff has reviewed an application and finds that a component of the\napplicant's project, as proposed or as conditioned by the draft siting permit, conforms to all applicable requirements of statute and regulation, the burden\nof persuasion is on the potential party proposing any issue related to that\ncomponent to demonstrate that it is both substantive and significant. (5)\n\nIf the ALJ determines that there are no\nadjudicable issues, the ALJ shall direct that no adjudicatory hearing be held\nand that Office Staff continue processing the application to issue the\nrequested siting permit, including issuance of a written summary and assessment\nof public comments received during the public comment period on issues not\notherwise addressed in the ALJ's ruling. (6)\n\nThe completeness of an application, as\ndefined in this Part, shall not be an issue for adjudication. (7)\nORES-initiated modifications. The only\nissues that may be adjudicated are those related to the basis for modification\ncited in the Office's notice to the permittee. Whenever such issues are\nproposed for adjudication, the determination to require adjudication shall be\nmade according to the standards set forth in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. Notes\nN.Y.
