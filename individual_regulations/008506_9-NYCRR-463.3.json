Tit. 9 § 463.3 - General provisions applicable to residential and commercial moving expenses\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe provisions stated herein apply to eligible persons\noccupying property to which title vested in the State on or after July 1, 1971. Application for payment of moving expenses shall be made by an eligible person\nin writing to the commissioner upon forms prescribed and shall be accompanied\nby such information, evidence and executed vouchers as may be required. Such\napplication shall be submitted to the commissioner through the regional park\noffices and payment of such moving expenses will be made to eligible persons\nunder the circumstances and to the extent set forth herein. (a) Any individual, family, business or farm\noperator is eligible to receive payment for the reasonable expenses of moving\nhis personal property subsequent to the earlier of the following two dates: (1)\nhe is in occupancy at the initiation of\nnegotiations for the acquisition of the real property in whole or in part; or\n(2)\nhe is in occupancy at the\ntime he is given a written notice by the State that it is their intent to\nacquire the property by a given date or he is given notice to vacate the\nproperty by a specific date. (b) Where the acquisition of real property\nused for a business or farm operation which is eligible for a payment under\nsubdivision (a) of this section causes a person to vacate a dwelling from other\nreal property not acquired, the additional expenses of moving such personalty\nare eligible for the appropriate moving payments. (c) Moving expenses shall not exceed the cost\nof transportation beyond 50 miles, except in the case of a business or farm\nwhen the State determines that relocation cannot be accomplished within the\n50-mile area; such exceptions may only be allowed to the nearest adequate and\navailable site. (d) The cost of\ninsurance premiums covering loss and damage of personal property while in\nstorage or transit will be eligible for reimbursement. Moving expenses shall\nnot include any direct losses or losses due to negligence. (e) The type of interest acquired does not\naffect the eligibility of relocation costs for reimbursement, provided the\ninterest acquired is sufficient to cause displacement. If, in the opinion of\nthe commissioner, the acquisition of a portion of an entire premises or of\naccess thereto renders all or the remainder of such premises unsuitable for\ncontinued use and occupation, or renders it without suitable access, the\nremoval of personal property from the entire property may be considered\neligible for the payment of moving expenses. (f) Moving expenses shall not include the\ncost of moving any fixtures or equipment considered part of the realty from the\nacquired property nor will reimbursement be made for any cost of construction\nor improvement to the new location or for any remodeling, redecorating or\nreinforcing of the new structure to accommodate the eligible person or his\npersonal property, unless required by law, or deemed to be in the public\ninterest by the commissioner. (g) Reimbursement for electrical wiring and plumbing charges and communication\nsystems work, covers only that work which is directly related to the personal\nproperty being relocated. Reimbursement is to exclude any costs of bringing\nelectrical or plumbing services to the new site, but may include costs of labor\nand materials of distributing these services to the personal property\nrelocated. Reimbursement under this category excludes costs of installing basic\nelectrical wiring or plumbing to a new structure, or that normally found and\nexpected in an existing structure, and is intended to cover only those costs\nnecessary to provide sufficient and adequate, but not super-adequate, utilities\nto operate the displaced business. (h) No reimbursement for overtime payments\nwill be allowed unless prior approval is received in writing from the\noffice. (i) It is expected that in\nanticipation of moving, the business or farm will reduce their inventories of\nstock or merchandise as much as practicable in order to have the removal\naccomplished in the most businesslike manner. (j) Application for payment of moving\nexpenses must be made within 12 months after vacating of acquired premises or\nsix months after final award determination in a case litigated in the courts of\nthe State, whichever is the later. Such limitation shall include any eligible\nstorage period. (k) In case a\nbuilding or structure acquired by the State is returned to the owners under an\nagreement, an eligible person will be entitled to the moving expenses for any\npersonal effects, furniture and household equipment remaining in the building\nor structure at the time of removal of such building or structure; however, the\ncost of moving the structure is not eligible for moving expenses. The eligible\nperson, at his option, may accept a room-count allowance or receive\nreimbursement on the actual cost basis. (l) In the case where the acquisition of real\nproperty causes the displacement of an advertising sign and such sign\nconstitutes the only improvement to the property acquired, or where the\nacquisition causes a person to remove his advertising sign from real property\nnot acquired, the owner of the advertising sign is eligible for appropriate\nmoving payments. However, where the advertising sign is owned by and located on\nthe business or farm displaced, there wll be no separate moving or related\nexpenses considered. (m) Moving\njunkyards and automobile graveyards. The State will pay the cost to put the\njunk or automobile bodies in an acceptable condition for delivery to the\nnearest reasonable salvage collection point, together with the transportation\ncosts from the appropriated property to said salvage collection point. In the\ncase of moving the material from an appropriated junkyard to a substitute\nlocation, the State will pay the processing cost to prepare the junk for\nremoval by the most economical means. The State will not pay the cost of\ndisassembly for resale of parts. (n) An advertising sign, junkyard or\nautomobile graveyard that is otherwise eligible for moving payments will not be\neligible when it is moved to a site in violation of State, Federal or local\nregulations. (o) An otherwise\neligible owner of an advertising sign or a nonprofit business is not entitled\nto an \"in lieu of\" moving expense payment. (p) If the actual costs incurred by the\neligible person exceed the office's approved limit of moving expenses, the\neligible person may submit to the office a fully detailed explanation for the\nexcess costs. The office's approval limit may be adjusted\naccordingly. (q) The cost of\nnecessary storage for a period not to exceed six months may be considered as\npart of moving expenses and will be subject to the following provisions: (1)\n\nMoving expenses may include the cost of\nmoving into dead storage at the prevailing rate in a commercial storage\nfacility or warehouse; no payment will be made for storage on premises owned or\noccupied by the eligible person, members of his immediate family, or his legal\nor financial representative. (2)\n\nIf\npersonal property is subsequently sold or delivered from storage to third\nparties, reimbursement for storage or moving out of storage will not be\nallowed. (r) The costs\nof storage or moving out of storage will not be considered in calculating a\nfigure for determining the extent of participation in any other benefits denied\nherein. (s) The State will not\nparticipate in more than one move of a displaced person unless in the opinion\nof the commissioner it is in the public interest to do so. (t) In the case of a hardship where advance\npayment of moving expenses is requested, the eligible person must submit in\nadvance a written application setting forth the full extent and circumstances\nof the hardship. A written determination will be made by the office. If the\noffice determines a hardship exists, an advanced payment of reasonable\nnecessary moving expenses may be made. (u) In unusual or hardship situations, when\ndetermined to be in the public interest, the commissioner may authorize a\npayment even though the strict requirements of eligibility specified herein are\nnot met.
