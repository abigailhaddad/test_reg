V, New York State Supplement Introduction - New York State Supplement Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe intent of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for\n\nStreets and Highways -- 2009 Edition (MUTCD) is to enhance highway safety and\noperation by requiring uniform, understandable, and effective traffic control\ndevices on facilities open to public travel. Traffic control devices installed on such facilities within the\n\nState of New York are required to conform to the MUTCD, published by the\n\nFederal Highway Administration (FHWA). Section 1680(a) of the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law\nrequires that \"the Department of Transportation shall adopt a manual and\nspecifications for a uniform system of traffic control devices consistent with\nthe provisions of this chapter for use upon highways within this state. Such\nuniform system shall correlate with and so far as practicable conform to\nnationally accepted standards.\"\nEffective September 13, 2007, the provisions of the MUTCD were\nformally adopted by the State of New York. These regulations also provided for\na New York State Supplement to the MUTCD to become effective on that date. Combined, the two comprise the \"manual and specifications for a uniform system\nof traffic control devices\" required by Section 1680(a). The current MUTCD, the\n2009 Edition, was adopted by the FHWA on December 16, 2009, and became\neffective January 15, 2010. Purpose of the New York State Supplement to the MUTCD\nDeviations from the MUTCD are published in the New York State\n\nSupplement to the MUTCD (NYS Supplement), and are justified in cases where: New\n\nYork law does not allow or support use of a device as described in the MUTCD; more restrictive guidance is desired; traffic control devices unique to New\n\nYork need to be included; and/or the exclusion of optional traffic control\ndevices is desired. These deviations are adopted through the State\n\nAdministrative Procedures Act (SAPA) process and by permission of the\nFHWA. How to Cite\n\nIn referencing 17 NYCRR Chapter V, it is acceptable to refer to\nthese provisions as the New York State Supplement to the Manual on Uniform\n\nTraffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways -- 2009 Edition, the New York\n\nState Supplement, or the NYS Supplement. How to Use the New York State Supplement to the MUTCD\nThis document supplements the 2009 Edition of the MUTCD, dated\n\nDecember 2009. Prior to the adoption of the MUTCD in New York, the user\nconsulted 17 NYCRR Chapter V (informally known as the New York State MUTCD). Most of what was needed to be known regarding the proper design, application, and location of a traffic control device was contained in that manual. Users\nnow need to follow a two-step process in order to properly ascertain that\ninformation. First, the user should refer to the MUTCD for information\nregarding a particular device. Second, the user should consult the New York\n\nState Supplement to determine if alternative or additional guidance is provided\nfor the traffic control device in question. The New York State Supplement conforms to the organization, section numbering, and paragraph numbering of the MUTCD. The New York State Supplement uses the following terms to\ninform the user what action is being taken in regards to the information being\nprovided. The terms and their meanings are as follows: DELETE = Remove material as directed. INSERT = Add material as directed. In some cases, there may be a conflict with material presented\nin the MUTCD and the New York State Supplement. When that occurs, the New York\n\nState Supplement is controlling, and the information provided in the New York\n\nState Supplement is meant to supersede the information found in the appropriate\nsections of the MUTCD. Design Details\n\nDesign details for signs and pavement markings are generally\nnot included in the MUTCD; they are found in the FHWA Standard Highway Signs\nand Markings (SHSM) book. Design details for devices referenced in the New York\n\nState Supplement can be found in the text and figures that accompany such\nreferences, as well as in the Sign Drawings located in Appendix 1 of this\n\nSupplement. Information regarding non-traffic control device issues such as\nsubstrate type (e.g., aluminum, steel, wood), retroreflective sheeting (e.g., engineering grade, high intensity), bolt hole locations, hardware (e.g., nuts, bolts, brackets), and posts may be provided in the MUTCD and/or SHSM, but for\nillustrative purposes only. Applicable guidelines and specifications for\ninformation on these and other related topics should be consulted. The New York State Supplement identifies traffic control\ndevices in a manner consistent with the alphanumeric system used in the MUTCD. Devices that are unique to New York are easily identifiable by the addition of\nthe prefix \"NY\" to the alphanumeric designation. The \"NY\" designations do not\nnecessarily correspond to MUTCD designations, though, as these designations are\nbased on the identification system used in the State MUTCD that was in effect\nbefore the MUTCD was adopted in New York. Users of the New York State Supplement will notice that signs\nthat can be used in both left and right orientations have been assigned a\nsingle alphanumeric designation (e.g., NYW2-8). This approach is consistent\nwith the style of the MUTCD. When using such signs in both the MUTCD and the\n\nNew York State Supplement, it is appropriate to add \"R\" or \"L\" suffixes to the\nsign designations (e.g., NYW2-8R) to specify the orientation desired. Obtaining the MUTCD\nThe MUTCD is available online in electronic format on the FHWA\nwebsite. Printed copies of the MUTCD 2009 Edition and cost information are\navailable from the American Association of State Highways and Transportation\n\nOfficials (AASHTO), the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), and the\n\nAmerican Traffic Safety Services Association (ATSSA). Obtaining the New York State Supplement and Other NYSDOT\nDocuments\n\nThe New York State Supplement is published under the title\n\nTransportation Title 17B (NYCRR) by Thomson West (800-344-5009). The MUTCD, the New York State Supplement, and other NYSDOT\ntraffic control device documents are available online at\nwww.nysdot.gov/portal/page/portal/divisions/operating/oom/transportation-systems/traffic-operations-section/mutcd.
