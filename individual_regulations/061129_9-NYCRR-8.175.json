CUOMO, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nlaws of the State of New York do hereby order and direct New York State's\ngovernment, through this Executive Order, not to enter into any contracts for\ninternet service unless the ISPs agree to adhere to net neutrality principles. The Office of General Services or any other governmental entity of New York\n\nState, as defined herein, is directed to incorporate into the State's\nprocurement process for internet, data, and telecommunications services\ncriteria requiring that recipients of state contracts adhere to internet\nneutrality principles as follows: A.

B. Agency Responsibilities\n1. Affected State Entities are hereby\ndirected to amend their procurement procedures to ensure that Affected State\n\nEntities only enter into contracts with ISPs that adhere to net neutrality\nprinciples and to ensure that internet services provided to Affected State\n\nEntities, include net neutrality protections, and specifically state that ISPs\nmay not block lawful content, applications, services, non-harmful devices, or\napplications that compete with other services provided by the ISP. Any contract\nor contract renewal entered into by Affected State Entities for internet\nservices on or after March 1, 2018, shall include a binding agreement\nconsistent with the foregoing, and Affected State Entities shall not enter into\na contract with any ISPs, agents therefor, or other entity offering to or\nprocuring on behalf of any Affected State Entity internet services, without\nsuch a binding agreement. 2.
