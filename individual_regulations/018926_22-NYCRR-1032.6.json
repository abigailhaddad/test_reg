  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1032.6 - Compensation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An attorney for children seeking compensation for services rendered pursuant to\n\nFamily Court Act, section 245 shall submit a claim for approval to the Family\n\nCourt on forms authorized by the Chief Administrator of the Courts. The Family\n\nCourt shall certify the claim, subject to appropriate modifications, and shall\nforward the claim to the Appellate Division for approval and certification to\nthe Comptroller for payment. When a claim is received by the Appellate Division\nmore than 90 days after the attorney for children has completed the assignment, the attorney for children shall provide an affidavit stating that the attorney\nfor children has not been paid for the services rendered, that a claim has not\nbeen submitted previously, and the reasons why the claim was not received\nwithin the 90-day period. The Appellate Division may, in the exercise of its\ndiscretion, disapprove any claim not received within the 90-day\nperiod. (b) Compensation in excess of the limits established by Family Court Act, section\n245 and Judiciary Law section 35 shall not be approved absent a showing of\nextraordinary circumstances. An attorney for children submitting a claim for\ncompensation in excess of the statutory limits shall submit, with the claim, an\naffidavit detailing the nature of the proceeding in which the services were\nrendered, the services rendered, the time expended, the expenses incurred and\nthe facts that would support a finding of extraordinary circumstances. Absent\nsuch an affidavit, a fee in excess of the statutory limits shall not be\napproved. (c) In\ndetermining whether there are extraordinary circumstances warranting\ncompensation in excess of the statutory limits, the Family Court and the\n\nAppellate Division shall consider: (1)\nwhether the matter involved\nunusually complex factual or legal issues; (2)\nwhether a novel issue of law, which\nrequired extensive legal research was involved; (3)\nwhether a lengthy trial or\nother in-court proceedings were necessary; and\n(4)\nany other unique or\nunusual circumstances. The expenditure of time alone, however, shall not constitute an extraordinary circumstance. (d) When an\nattorney for children anticipates that expenses, as authorized pursuant to\n\nFamily Court Act, section 245 and Judiciary Law, section 35, will exceed\n$1,000, the attorney for children shall, before incurring such expenses, obtain\napproval of the Family Court and the Appellate Division.
