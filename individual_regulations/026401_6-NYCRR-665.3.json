Tit. 6 § 665.3 - Applicability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part\nprovides the framework for local government administration of a freshwater\nwetlands regulatory protection program in those areas of the State where the\ncommissioner has promulgated an official map and a local government, rather\nthan the department, is the regulatory authority. (b) Permit applications must be filed with\nand processed by the department in accordance with the department's freshwater\nwetlands permit regulations (Part 663 of this Title) for those areas of the\n\nState where the commissioner has promulgated an official map and: (1)\na local government has not assumed\nregulatory authority pursuant to section 24-0501 of the act and this\n\nPart; (2)\na county has transferred\nregulatory authority to the department pursuant to section 24-0503 of the act\nand section\n665.4\n(k) of this\n\nPart; or\n(3)\nthe commissioner has\nsuperseded local authority and retained jurisdiction pursuant to section\n24-0503 of the act and section\n665.12\nof this Part. (c) For those areas of the State\nwhere the commissioner has not promulgated an official map, permit applications\nmust be filed with and processed by the department in accordance with the\ndepartment's interim freshwater wetlands permit regulations (Part 662 of this\n\nTitle). (d) A local government, upon the implementation of a local freshwater wetlands protection program\npursuant to title 5 of the act and this Part, becomes the regulatory authority\nfor all freshwater wetlands wholly or partially within its jurisdiction, except\nfor wetlands and their adjacent areas exempted from local implementation in\naccordance with section 24-0505 of the act. These wetlands will be shown on the\nofficial map and will be Class I wetlands as described in the department's\nfreshwater wetlands maps and classification regulations (Part 664 of this\n\nTitle). (e) If the department\nreclassifies a wetland under local jurisdiction to Class I, the local\ngovernment retains jurisdiction for any permit application received prior to\nthe reclassification and must apply the Class I standards of this\n\nPart. (f) Notwithstanding the\nexemption of Class I wetlands from local implementation described in\nsubdivision (d) of this section, the commissioner may delegate the department's\nregulatory authority for those wetlands to a local government pursuant to\nparagraph 3-0301.2(p) of the Environmental Conservation Law and in accordance\nwith section\n665.9\nof this Part. (g) This Part and the act do not apply to\nland uses, improvements or developments for which final approval was adopted\nprior to September 1, 1975, from the local governmental authority or\nauthorities having jurisdiction over such land use. However, expansion or\nsignificant modification of the existing use, or the introduction of sewage\neffluent, runoff of pesticides, or disposal of toxic substances into wetlands\nor adjacent areas are regulated activities under this Part. The term final\napproval is defined in section 24-1305 of the Act. A local government's chief\nlegal officer may issue an opinion to a person wishing to rely on such final\napproval so long as the opinion is consistent with the act and general\nlaw. (h) This Part is not\napplicable to wetlands or portions of wetlands within the Adirondack Park. Those wetlands or portions of wetlands are regulated by the Adirondack Park\n\nAgency and Adirondack Park local governments, pursuant to title 8 of the\nact. (i) No provision of this Part\nshall be deemed to remove from local government any authority pertaining to the\nregulation of freshwater wetlands under the County, City, General Municipal, Municipal Home Rule, Town, Village or any other Law.
