The first category is employers with an establishment that\nhad 20-249 employees at any time during the previous calendar year and are\nclassified in an industry listed in subdivision (d) of this section; establishments in this category must submit the required information from the\n\nSummary of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses Form SH-900.1\nto the Department of Labor once a year. The second category are employers with\nan establishment that had 250 or more employees at any time during the previous\ncalendar year and are required by this part to keep records; establishments in\nthis category must submit the required information from the\n\nSummary of\n\nWork-Related Injuries and Illnesses Form SH-900.1\nto the Department of\n\nLabor once a year.

Employers in these three categories must submit the required\ninformation by the date listed in subdivision (c) of this section of the year\nafter the calendar year covered by the form (for example, 2024 for the 2023\nform(s)). If an employer is not covered by any of these three categories, then\nthe employer must submit the information to the Department of Labor only if the\n\nDepartment of Labor notifies them to do so for an individual data\ncollection. (2)\n\nEach individual\nemployed in the establishment at any time during the calendar year counts as\none employee, including full-time, part-time, seasonal, and temporary\nworkers. (3)\nOSHA will notify\nemployers by mail if they will be required to submit information as part of an\nindividual data collection under paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of this\nsection. OSHA will also announce individual data collections through\npublication in the Federal Register, the OSHA newsletter, and announcements on\nthe OSHA website. Neither OSHA nor the Department of Labor will notify\nemployers who must routinely submit the information in accordance with\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (a) of this section that their submission\nis due. (4)\n\nEmployers that are\nrequired to submit information under paragraphs (1) or (2) of subdivision (a)\nof this section, must submit the information once a year, by the date listed in\nsubdivision (c) of this section of the year after the calendar year covered by\nthe form (for example, 2019 for the 2018 form). Employers that are submitting\ninformation because OSHA notified the employer of an individual data collection\nunder paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of this section, must submit the\ninformation as specified in the notification. (5)\n\nEmployers must submit the information\nelectronically. An employer must submit the information electronically and in\nthe manner prescribed by the commissioner. (6)\n\nEmployers who have ownership of or\ncontrol over one or more establishments required to submit information under\nsubdivision (a) of this section may collect and electronically submit the\ninformation for the establishment(s).

Employers\nthat are required to submit under paragraphs (1) or (2) of subdivision (a) of\nthis section must submit all of the required information by March 2 of the year\nafter the calendar year covered by the form(s) (for example, by March 2, 2024, for the forms covering 2023).
