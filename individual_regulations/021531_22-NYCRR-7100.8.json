  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 7100.8 - Consideration of candidates\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Commissioner impartiality. (1)\nA commissioner will\nconsider each applicant in an impartial, objective manner, and disclose to the\ncommission any relationship with an applicant that has or may reasonably appear\nto have a bearing on the nomination process. (2)\nA commissioner will not be\ninfluenced other than by facts or opinion that are relevant to the judicial\nqualifications of the applicants, and will promptly report to the chairperson\nany attempt to influence a commissioner other than by fact or\nopinion. (3)\nA\ncommissioner will not individually communicate, directly or indirectly, orally\nor in writing, with an applicant about the application or the process, from the\ntime the application is submitted until completion of the final vote on the\nnominations. (b) Initial screening procedures. (1)\n\nThe commission will\nestablish a date by which questionnaires must be filed for a particular\nvacancy, and after that date the procedures for initial screening of candidates\nwill commence. If the number of applications submitted by potentially well\nqualified individuals appears to the commission to be inadequate, the\ncommission may extend the deadline for submission of applications and conduct\nfurther public outreach. (2)\n\nEach commissioner will be furnished\na copy of each application received, together with any further necessary\nbackground information, and the chairperson will request each commissioner to\nprovide prompt written advice as to the names of those candidates that the\ncommissioner believes merit further consideration as part of the final\nnomination process. The chairperson's request will indicate the date by which\nthe members should submit such names. Candidates whose names have not been\nsubmitted to the chairperson by at least two commissioners shall not be given\nfurther consideration for the particular vacancy unless the commission\ndetermines otherwise. (3)\n\nThe chairperson will call a meeting\nof the commission, for a date following the date by which the commissioners are\nto have proposed candidates who merit further consideration, to assess the\nrelative merits of the remaining candidates and to determine the procedures to\nbe followed for their further consideration. The commission thereafter will\nmeet to determine which candidates will be interviewed by the commission as\npart of the nomination procedures described in subdivision (c) of this section. Each candidate to be interviewed will be asked to file with the commission, prior to the interview, a sworn financial statement in a form supplied by the\ncommission. (4)\n\nNotwithstanding the above, the commission may employ a two-step application\nprocedure in which a candidate's initial submission consists of a short-form\nquestionnaire, including a resume, a statement setting forth the candidate's\nqualifications and interest in seeking nomination and any other materials the\ncandidate wishes to include. Each commissioner will be furnished with a copy of\neach initial submission received, together with any further background\ninformation that may be pertinent, and the chairperson will request each\ncommissioner to provide prompt advice as to the names of those candidates that\nthe commissioner believes merit an interview as part of the final nomination\nprocess. The chairperson's request will indicate the date by which the\ncommissioners should submit such names. If two or more commissioners determine\nthat a candidate merits an interview by the full commission, that candidate\nwill be asked to submit a full questionnaire, unless the commission determines\notherwise. Screening of the candidate would then proceed as set forth above. The commission presumably will employ this two-step application procedure for\nall vacancies; however, circumstances may arise, such as the timing of the\nvacancy and deadlines for completion of the process, that will make use of the\ntwo-step process impracticable. (c) Interview and nomination\nprocedures. (1)\n\nIf the\nnominations are for the office of Chief Judge, the number of candidates to be\nnominated will be seven pursuant to section\n63\n(2)(a)\nof the Judiciary Law. If the\nnominations are for the office of Associate Judge, the number of candidates to\nbe nominated will be the maximum number specified by section\n63 (2)(b) or\n(c) of the Judiciary Law, unless fewer\ncandidates receive the affirmative vote of at least eight\ncommissioners. (2)\n\nThe interview will be conducted by a quorum of the commission, meeting in\nperson, at a time and place convenient to both the candidate and commission. The interview will be confidential as required by section\n66\nof the\n\nJudiciary Law. At the interview, the candidate will be invited to make an\nopening statement, and thereafter, the commissioners and counsel may ask\nquestions bearing on the candidate's qualifications for the position of Chief\n\nJudge or Associate Judge of the Court of Appeals, as the case may be. (3)\n\nFollowing completion of\nall interviews, the commission will meet and discuss the relative merits of the\nremaining candidates and attempt to reach the concurrence of eight or more\ncommissioners that a particular candidate or candidates should be nominated. In\nthe event that the concurrence of eight or more commissioners is not reached as\nto all nominations, the balloting procedure described in section\n7100.12\n(Appendix I) of this Part\nwill commence. (4)\n\nThe objectives of the nomination and voting procedures are: (i) to ensure that the\ncommission thoroughly considers and evaluates each candidate; (ii)\nto ensure that the\ncommission is impartial in its deliberations; (iii)\nto promote consensus in the\nselection of nominees; and\n(iv)\nto ensure that each nominee\nreceives at least eight affirmative votes from the commissioners, as required\nby section\n63\n(3)\nof the Judiciary Law. (5)\n\nAll votes taken\nwith respect to nominations will be by secret ballot. (6)\n\nPursuant to section\n65\n(4)\nof the Judiciary Law, upon the completion\nby the commission of its consideration and evaluation of the qualifications of\na candidate, there will be no reconsideration of that candidate for the vacancy\nfor which the candidate was considered, except with the concurrence of nine\ncommissioners. For this purpose, the commission will not be considered to have\ncompleted its consideration and evaluation of the qualifications of a candidate\nuntil the conclusion of the meeting at which the candidate was nominated or\neliminated for the particular vacancy. (d) Consideration of the\nqualifications of a candidate. In considering and evaluating each candidate's\nqualifications for the Court of Appeals, the commission will consider criteria\nand standards including character, temperament, professional aptitude and\nexperience. Commissioners and commission staff will not discriminate against\nany candidate on the basis of any legally impermissible factor. (e) Commitment to diversity. The commission is committed to considering nominees for the Court of Appeals\nwith outstanding personal and professional qualifications who reflect the\ndiversity of New York's citizenry including, but not limited to, diversity in\nrace, ethnicity, gender, religion, sexual orientation, community service, nature of legal practice or professional background and geography. A diverse\n\nJudiciary ensures that a broad array of perspectives and experiences are\nbrought to the bench; reinforces public trust and confidence in the fairness of\nthe justice system and the administration of justice; and ultimately enhances\nthe delivery of justice and the Judiciary's credibility and moral\nauthority.
