Except if a covered provider has obtained a waiver\npursuant to section\n1002.4\nof this Part, a covered\nprovider as defined in this regulation shall not use State funds or\n\nState-authorized payments for executive compensation given directly or\nindirectly to a covered executive in an amount greater than $199,000 per annum, provided, however, that the department shall review this figure annually to\ndetermine whether adjustment is necessary based on appropriate factors and\nsubject to the approval of the Director of the Division of the Budget. Commencing on July 1, 2013, the limits on executive compensation pursuant to\nthis Part shall be effective and applicable to each covered provider on the\nfirst day of each covered provider's respective covered reporting\nperiod. (b) Program services\nrendered by covered executives. The limit on executive compensation pursuant to\nthis Section shall not be applied to limit reimbursement with State funds or\n\nState-authorized payments for reasonable compensation paid to a covered\nexecutive for program services, including but not limited to supervisory\nservices performed to facilitate the covered provider's program services, rendered by the executive outside of his or her managerial or policy-making\nduties. Documentation of such program services rendered shall be used by the\ncovered provider to determine that percentage, if any, of the covered\nexecutive's compensation that is attributable to program services and that\ncompensation shall not be considered in the calculation of his or her executive\ncompensation. Such documentation shall be maintained and provided to the\ndepartment or its designee upon request. Clinical and program personnel in a\nhospital or other entity providing program services, including chairs of\ndepartments, heads of service, chief medical officers, directors of nursing, or\nsimilar types of personnel fulfilling administrative functions that are\nnevertheless directly attributable to and comprise program services shall not\nbe considered covered executives for purposes of limiting the use of State\nfunds or State-authorized payments to compensate them. (c) Covered providers with multiple sources\nof State funds or State-authorized payments. If a covered provider receives\n\nState funds or State-authorized payments from multiple sources, the provider's\ncompliance with the limits on executive compensation in subdivision (a) shall\nbe determined based upon the total amount of such funding received and the\nreimbursements received from all sources of State funds or State-authorized\npayments. As set forth in section\n1002.5\nof this Part, the covered\nprovider shall report all of such State funds and State-authorized payments in\nthe form specified by the department or its designee. (d) Subcontractors and agents of covered\nproviders. The limits on executive compensation in subdivision (a) of this\nsection and the reporting requirements in section\n1002.5\nof this Part shall apply to\nsubcontractors and agents of covered providers if and to the extent that such a\nsubcontractor or agent has received State funds or State-authorized payments\nfrom the covered provider to provide program or administrative services during\nthe reporting period and would otherwise meet the definition of a covered\nprovider but for the fact that it has received State funds or State-authorized\npayments from the covered provider rather than directly from a governmental\nagency. A covered provider shall incorporate into its agreement with such a\nsubcontractor or agent the terms of these regulations by reference to require\nand facilitate compliance. Upon request, covered providers shall promptly\nreport to the funding or authorizing agency the identity of such subcontractors\nand agents, along with any other information requested by that agency or by the\ndepartment or its designee. A covered provider shall not be held responsible\nfor a subcontractor's or agent's failure to comply with these\nregulations. (e) Covered providers\nreceiving State funds or State-authorized payments from county or local\ngovernment or an entity contracting on its behalf. The department or its\ndesignee, rather than the county or local unit of government or an entity\ncontracting on behalf of such government, shall be responsible for obtaining\nthe necessary reporting from and compliance by such covered providers, and\nshall issue guidance to affected county and local governments to set forth the\nprocedures by which the department or its designee shall do so. (f) Other limits on executive compensation. If the contract, grant, or other agreement is subject to more stringent limits\non executive compensation, whether through law or contract, such limits shall\ncontrol and shall not be affected by the less stringent limits imposed by these\nregulations. However, the definition and interpretation of terms in this Part\nshall not be affected or limited by the definition or interpretation of terms\nin other regulations or agreements. (g) A covered provider's contract or other\nagreement with a covered executive agreed to prior to July 1, 2012 shall not be\nsubject to the limits in this section during the term of the contract, except\nthat: (1)\ncovered providers must apply for a\nwaiver for any contracts or agreements with covered executives for executive\ncompensation that exceeds or otherwise fails to comply with these regulations\nif such contracts or agreements extend beyond April 1, 2015; and\n(2)\nrenewals of such contracts or agreements\nafter the completion of their term must comply with these\nregulations.
