  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 323.2 - Commencement of contributions\n\nState Regulations\n\nSince few payrolls begin on January 1, 1977, the effective\ndate of article 14, the commencement of contributions as of that date would\npresent an obstacle to the implementation of the coordinated-escalator\nretirement plan. Therefore, the contributions required by section 517 shall be\ndeducted beginning with the first full payroll period in 1977 with respect to\nwhich payment is made in 1977. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n323.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
