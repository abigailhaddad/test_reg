(ii)\n\nField supervision. (a) Resident's furlough residence. (1)\n\nVerification of resident's furlough\nresidence prior to initial furlough. A resident participating in a continuous\ntemporary release program shall not be granted a weekend furlough unless a\nparole officer has made a visit, within the 30 days immediately preceding, to\nthe resident's proposed furlough residence and, on the basis of his\nrecommendation, the residence has been approved for weekend furlough purposes\nby the temporary release committee chairperson or the facility\ndirector. (2)\n\nVerification of\nfurlough residence after the resident's initial furlough. (i) The temporary release parole officer\nshall make a minimum of one home visit each month to the approved furlough\nresidence of a resident participating in a weekend furlough program. The home\nvisit shall occur on a weekend day or a holiday when the resident is expected\nto be at the furlough residence. A resident on a weekend furlough should\nanticipate a visit from the temporary release parole officer. When warranted, the parole officer may impose a curfew in order to make certain that the\nresident will be at his furlough residence. Additional home visits may be made\non weekdays. Regular visits to the furlough residence for counseling purposes\nshould include personal interviews with the resident and members of his family, whenever possible, to determine whether the resident is experiencing any\nunusual problems so that the proper corrective action may be taken. The\ntemporary release parole officer must see the resident at his approved furlough\nresidence at least once every three months. The temporary release parole\nofficer has no responsibility to visit or verify a resident's furlough\nresidence if a resident is not taking part in a weekend furlough program. In\nsuch cases, this fact shall be recorded in the resident's case file each month, in the parole officer's temporary release monthly report and in any other\nnecessary files and documents. (ii)\n\nWhere the continuous temporary release participant's furlough residence is\noutside of the county where the facility is located, or if the facility is\nlocated in New York City, outside of the city, the chairperson of the temporary\nrelease committee shall ensure that at least three days prior to the resident's\ninitial furlough, a Notification to Authorities of a Temporary Release Program\nform is forwarded to the appropriate local law enforcement agency and the area\nparole office covering the geographic region where the furlough residence is\nlocated, alerting them of the resident's pending furlough, his furlough\naddress, and the name, work location and telephone number of the temporary\nrelease parole officer responsible for the resident. If the initial\nnotification alerts the local law enforcement agency and area parole officer\nthat the resident will be continually released on a weekend furlough at\nspecified periods of time thereafter, a subsequent form does not have to be\nsent each time the resident goes on a weekend furlough. (iii)\n\nHowever, if a resident has an approved\nweekend furlough residence outside of the county where the facility is located, or if the facility is located in New York City, outside of the city, the\ntemporary release parole officer shall, after the resident has completed his\ninitial furlough, request an out-of-area parole supervision investigation from\nthe area parole officer responsible for the geographic region containing the\nfurlough residence. If the area parole officer indicates that no unusual\nproblems exist with respect to the furlough residence and the resident\nexperienced no unusual problems during his initial furlough, the temporary\nrelease parole officer is not required to request any further checks by the\narea parole officer of the furlough residence. The temporary release parole\nofficer shall complete a minimum of one telephone call to the approved furlough\nresidence each month to verify the furlough residence, establish a relationship\nwith the resident's family, and learn of any problems the resident is\nexperiencing so that corrective action may be taken. However, if the temporary\nrelease parole officer suspects that the resident is experiencing unusual\nproblems or unsatisfactory adjustment to the community while on furlough, the\ntemporary release parole officer shall also request an out-of-area parole\nsupervision investigation. Additionally, in out-of-area cases where the\napproved furlough residence does not have a telephone, the temporary release\nparole officer shall request an out-of-area parole supervision investigation\nonce a month. (iv)\n\nThe temporary\nrelease parole officer shall provide explicit instructions regarding the\nreporting requirements to a resident participating in a continuous temporary\nrelease program who has a weekend furlough residence outside of the\ngeographical region where the facility is located. When appropriate, the\ntemporary release parole officer may instruct the resident to report to the\narea parole office after ascertaining that such office has the ability to take\na weekend report from the resident. (3)\n\nResidents participating in a work release\nprogram. (i) The temporary release parole\nofficer must visit and see a resident participating in a work release program\nat his place of employment during the first 10 days of the resident's\nemployment at a new job. (ii)\n\nThereafter, the temporary release parole officer must visit and see the\nresident at his place of employment at least once a month in order to verify\nthe resident's participation in the employment program. The temporary release\nparole officer should also use the employment visits to obtain information\nabout the resident's attendance, work habits, attitude toward work, and any\nother information which might be useful in planning for the needs of the\nresident. (4)\n\nResidents\nparticipating in an educational leave program. (i) The temporary release parole officer must\nvisit and see the resident at the school or program where the resident is\nparticipating in an educational leave program at least once a month. (ii)\n\nThe temporary release parole officer\nalso should use these visits to establish relationships with the staff of the\ninstitution who may help him monitor the resident's progress in his educational\nrelease program. (iii)\nA temporary\nrelease participant may take part in an educational leave program only at a\ncollege, university or vocational training program which agrees to maintain\nattendance records for him. The temporary release parole officer shall be\nresponsible for ensuring that the educational release participant's college, university or vocational training program maintains an accurate record of class\nattendance on the educational release participant. (iv)\n\nThe temporary release parole officer\nmust verify the resident's class attendance with the college, university or\nvocational program at least once every two weeks. Unauthorized absences from\nclass are to be reported immediately to the temporary release committee\nchairperson. (v) The temporary\nrelease parole officer shall maintain attendance records for each educational\nleave participant and shall file these attendance records in the resident's\nfacility file when the resident completes his educational leave program or\nleaves the facility. (vi)\n\nThe\nresident's counselor or the temporary release parole officer should require\nthat the resident schedule his classes to insure a minimum of release time not\nspent in educational pursuits. The hours that a resident is permitted to be\naway from the facility should bear a direct relation to the beginning and\nending times of his classes and should allow reasonable travel time to and from\nthe facility only. Allowances may be made for reasonable meal periods and\noccasional periods of time for library study, conferences with instructors and\ncounselors and for special help and attention from the educational\nprogram. (vii)\n\nThe temporary\nrelease committee chairperson shall keep a record of each resident enrolled in\nan educational leave program. At the conclusion of each semester, the temporary\nrelease committee chairperson shall prepare and forward to the facility\ndirector a list of all residents who were enrolled in educational leave\nprograms that semester, and indicate whether the residents completed the\nsemester in a satisfactory manner. If a resident did not complete the semester\nin a satisfactory manner for any reason, including parole, transfer to another\nfacility or sickness, the reason(s) for the resident's noncompletion shall be\nindicated. The facility director shall transmit such reports to the director of\ntemporary release programs. When appropriate, the temporary release parole\nofficer shall provide the temporary release committee chairperson with a\ntranscript of each resident's semester grades. A copy of these transcripts\nshall be attached to the temporary release committee chairperson's previously\nmentioned list of educational leave program participants. (5)\n\nCommunity services leave and industrial\ntraining leave programs. A resident participating in a continuous community\nservices leave or industrial training leave program shall be subject to the\nsame supervision standards required for residents participating in work release\nprograms as specified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (6)\n\nFurlough schedules and procedures for\ncontinuous temporary release participants. (i) In order to request a furlough for the\npurpose of maintaining family ties, a resident must submit a Temporary Release\n\nAuthorization Request form to his temporary release parole officer. In order to\nrequest any other type of furlough, a resident must submit his request form to\nhis facility counselor. (ii)\n\nWhen a\nholiday falls on a Monday or a Friday, that day may be granted as part of a\nfurlough after verification by the temporary release parole officer that the\nresident is not scheduled to work or attend classes on that day. (iii)\nA resident who begins a furlough on\n\nSaturday morning must return to the facility no later than the following Monday\nevening. A resident furloughed on Friday evening, or during the day as provided\nin subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, must return by Sunday\nevening. (iv)\nA resident who is an\nactive member of a religion which has its religious services or part of its\nholy day on Friday evening may be granted special permission by the temporary\nrelease committee chairperson or the facility director not to return to the\nfacility on the Friday evening before an overnight furlough and may go directly\nfrom his job or educational program to his furlough address. (v) Whenever a resident appears before the\n\nBoard of Parole and is ordered held by the board, the temporary release\ncommittee shall determine whether the resident should remain in his continuous\ntemporary release program and/or whether the resident's furlough schedule\nshould be changed. (vi)\nA resident\nwho does not have a suitable furlough address may be given a furlough only for\na short, specified period of time. (c) Return\nprocedures. (1)\n\nWhenever a resident\nparticipating in either a short-term or continuous temporary release program\nreturns to the facility from a temporary release program, the resident shall\nsurrender his memorandum of agreement and temporary release identification\ncard. (2)\n\nIf a resident fails to\nsurrender his temporary release identification card upon return to the\nfacility, he shall be subject to disciplinary action and referred to the\ntemporary release committee for evaluation of his temporary release program, as\nappropriate. (3)\n\nThe resident shall\nalso surrender any earnings or other funds which come under his control and all\nmoney and tokens not used by him while he was out of the facility. All funds\nmust be surrendered in the form in which they were received (i.e., check or\ncash). The funds shall be delivered to the business office for deposit in the\nresident's account or to the petty cash account, whichever is appropriate. The\nresident will be given a receipt for the money he surrenders. Under no\ncircumstances shall a continuous temporary release participant be permitted to\ntake money, tokens or other funds into other parts of the facility. (4)\n\nWhen a resident has returned to the\nfacility with money in excess of what he has been expected to bring back, an\ninvestigation shall be conducted into the source of these funds. If the\nresident cannot offer an acceptable explanation for the source of these funds, he shall be subject to disciplinary action and referred to the temporary\nrelease committee for evaluation of his temporary release program, as\nappropriate. All excess funds found in the possession of a resident will be\nconsidered contraband. Additionally, the failure of a resident to turn in his\nearnings or any other funds which come under his control shall be considered a\nserious violation of the resident's temporary release memorandum of agreement, and the resident shall be subjected to disciplinary action which may result in\nhis removal from the program. (5)\n\nThe resident will remove his clothing and may be subject to an appropriate\nsearch as determined by the facility director. If the facility director so\ndirects, on an individual case-by-case basis and based on reasonable cause, the\nresident may be directed to submit to a body cavity search. (6)\n\nAfter the resident has been searched and\ncleared, the facility staff shall verify the resident's return time in the\nlogbook. The resident may dress in his facility clothing and proceed to the\nresidence area of the facility. (7)\n\nEvaluation upon return. Upon the return of a short-term temporary release\nparticipant to the facility, or upon completion or termination of a resident's\nparticipation in a continuous temporary release program, the resident's\nparticipation in the temporary release program shall be evaluated to determine\nwhether the program was completed successfully and to ascertain whether any\nprogram violations occurred. A full report of the resident's performance shall\nbe prepared. The report shall include, but not be limited to: the resident's\nadjustment to release, his supervision contacts, a statement of any violations\nof the terms and conditions of release committed by the resident and of any\ndisciplinary action taken, and an assessment of the resident's suitability for\nparole. A copy of the report, along with a copy of the memorandum of agreement, shall be placed in the resident's facility file and made available to the Board\nof Parole for the resident's next scheduled board appearance. One copy of each\nshall also be sent to the director of temporary release programs. (8)\n\nProgram violations. If either a\nshort-term or continuous temporary release participant commits any program\nviolation, he shall be subject to disciplinary action and referred to the\ntemporary release committee for evaluation of his temporary release program, as\nappropriate. Such reports and any follow-up action shall be noted in the\nresident's facility record. The provisions in Subparts 179-1 and 179-2 of this\n\nPart relating to good behavior allowances shall apply to a resident's behavior\nwhile participating in a temporary release program outside the premises of the\nfacility. Such allowances may be granted, withheld, forfeited or canceled in\nwhole or in part for behavior outside the premises of a facility to the same\nextent and in the same manner as is provided for with regard to behavior within\nthe facility premises. (9)\n\nAbsconding and failure to return on time. (i) If a short-term or continuous temporary release participant is unable to return\nto the facility by the time he is scheduled to return, the resident must\ncontact the facility to report that he is returning late for reasons beyond his\ncontrol and state the reasons why. (ii)\n\nThe facility director, the chairperson\nof the temporary release committee, the temporary release parole officer, or\nthe resident's facility counselor must either approve the resident's request\nfor an extension of time on temporary release or determine that the resident is\nto be considered late. However, under no circumstances shall a resident be\ngiven any extension of time on work, educational or another continuous\ntemporary release program which would cause him to be in the community more\nthan 14 hours in any given day. (iii)\nA resident is to be considered a\ntemporary release absconder if he fails to return to the facility by the time\nscheduled for return specified in the memorandum of agreement which he signed. If a resident has not returned to the institution at the time that he was due\nto return, or fails to notify the facility that he will be returning late, the\nfacility will assume the resident does not intend to return and a warrant for\nhis return shall be issued pursuant to Part 181 of this Title. (iv)\n\nIf a resident returns to a facility\nafter the scheduled time of return but less than 10 hours late, he shall be\nsubject to disciplinary action and referred to the temporary release committee\nfor evaluation of his temporary release program, as appropriate. An affirmative\nfinding that the resident was late without a legitimate reason shall not\nautomatically render the resident ineligible to continue participating in the\ncurrent temporary release program or to participate in any kind of temporary\nrelease program in the future. (v) The failure of a resident to voluntarily return to the facility more than 10\nhours after his prescribed time of return shall create a rebuttable presumption\nthat the failure to return was intentional. Therefore, in the event that a\nresident returns to a facility more than 10 hours late, the facility director\nshall be notified, the incident investigated, and a facility director's\nproceeding conducted during which the resident will be given the opportunity to\nrebut the presumption that his failure to return on time was intentional. In\nthe absence of such a rebuttal, the resident is to be found guilty of the\ndisciplinary charge and procedures for his removal from participation in any\ncurrent temporary release program shall be initiated pursuant to section\n179-3.14\nof this Subpart. Further, the resident is to be considered ineligible to take part in any temporary\nrelease program at any time in the future. A copy of the facility director's\nproceeding record shall be made part of the resident's facility file. A copy of\nthe record shall be transmitted to Central Office and a copy made available to\nthe Board of Parole for the resident's next scheduled board\nappearance. (vi)\n\nFor temporary\nreleasees 16 years of age and older, absconding from temporary release\nconstitutes a felony. Upon an affirmative finding at a facility director's\nproceeding that a youth has absconded from temporary release, the facility\ndirector shall file criminal charges against the resident alleging a violation\nof section\n205.17\nof the\n\nPenal Law--absconding from temporary release, 1st degree--and shall promptly\nnotify regional administration. (vii)\n\nThe temporary release parole officer is\nresponsible for promptly preparing a report of violation of temporary release\nafter a continuous temporary release participant absconds from temporary\nrelease. (10)\n\nArrest of\na resident on temporary release. If it becomes known that a resident is\narrested while participating in a short-term or continuous temporary release\nprogram, the facility director shall arrange contact with the arresting agency\nin order to secure the details of the arrest. The temporary release parole\nofficer shall prepare a supplementary report of violation of temporary release, detailing the new criminal charges, as soon as possible following the arrest. If criminal charges are pending as a result of a resident's arrest while on\ntemporary release, a division warrant and/or detainer shall be issued\nimmediately and lodged against the resident at his place of confinement. The\nfacility director shall advise both regional administration and the director of\ntemporary release programs of the details of the arrest and any action taken. The facility director shall arrange for the resident's return to Division for\n\nYouth custody upon release from local custody, if legally\nappropriate. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
