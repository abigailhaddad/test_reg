  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 2302.32 - Criteria for fund distribution of new multi-year and continuation grants-part c\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Category\nI--Criteria for screening. (1)\n\nThe project\nwas postmarked on or before the due date; (2)\n\nThe project contains all essential parts, including (a) original copy, original signature of authorized official, (appropriate number of copies), signed assurances, approval by the Board of\n\nEducation, data information, narrative, supporting documentation and\nappropriate budget forms; and\n(3)\n\nNonpublic involvement or sign-off per instructions are followed. (b) Category II--General criteria\nfor all projects. Where appropriate, and according to grant type and status: (1)\n\nThe planning process. (i) appropriate groups and individuals\ninvolved are represented. Among those to be involved might be students, parents, school personnel, nonprofit private school representatives, including\nthose with low incomes, and others broadly representative of the cultural and\neducational resources of the area to be served; (ii)\nspecific planning events were documented\nthat reflected adequate planning for the proposed projects; (iii)\nthe best available talents and\nresources were utilized, including a description of contributions by agencies\nand organizations. (2)\n\nNeed. (i) the need is fundamentally\neducational, rather than financial, and reflects State priorities and programs\ndesignated for part C; (ii)\nthe\nneed for the program at the local level is documented; (iii)\nthe target population is clearly\nidentified and the program offered is appropriate to participants. (3)\n\nObjectives. The objectives are\nclearly stated and, where appropriate, measurable. (4)\n\nActivities. (i) activities are clearly stated and\nindicate time lines, due dates and persons participating in the\nactivities; (ii)\nthe equipment and\nmaterials which will facilitate achieving the stated objectives show a direct\nrelationship to the proposed budget; (iii)\nwork descriptions give clear pictures\nof what it will take to get the job done. (5)\n\nEvaluation. The proposal contains\nevaluation strategies based on appropriate methodology which will provide\nevidence to determine the extent to which the behavior of the participants has\nbeen improved. The evaluation strategy appears to be reasonable for evaluating\nthe activities and objectives. (6)\n\nBudget. Provisions for budget of expenditures are adequate and appropriate; staff, facilities, equipment, and materials make a contribution to facilitating\nthe achievement of stated objectives. The budget should not generally exceed\nthe capacity of the district to continue support of the program after Federal\nfunds are discontinued. (7)\n\nEquitable distribution. (i) in the\npreparation of instructions to districts, the categories which have been\nestablished based on fiscal year 1976-78 program priority needs will be\nannounced to the field. This will assure the continuation of equitable\ndistribution among assessed needs of the past; (ii)\ninstructions will specify those need\nareas where proposals will be expressly solicited and funded for urban, suburban and rural areas. This will assure equitable distribution among these\ncategories; (iii)\nin addition, the\ntechnical assistance referred to in section\n2302.33\nof this Part will assure\nsmall and poor districts of special consideration for replication\nfunding. (c) Category III--General criteria for developer, validation, demonstration/replication grants. (1)\n\nDeveloper grants are those which develop new programs aimed at common needs and\nmay be prepared as multi-year or continuation grants. Initially, the applicant\nwould have to make a case that the program is based on the best known research, would be cost-effective and could be adopted by others if successful. There\nwould be increased emphasis on evaluation of developer grants and increased\nsupervision to assure developers are producing usable products. The applicant\nof a developer grant would be expected to serve as a demonstrator, if\nvalidated. The life of these grants would be from one to five years, depending\nupon their nature. (2)\n\nCriteria for\ndeveloper projects: (i) evidence that the\nproject is designed to demonstrate solutions to identified educational needs\nand will substantially increase the educational opportunities of\nchildren; (ii)\nthe proposed\nsolution is capable of solving the problem described and is cost-effective in\nterms of the district's ability to continue said program after initial costs\nare reduced or eliminated. The cost per pupil should be reasonable when\ncompared to programs of a similar nature. Sources of funds to continue the\nprogram when title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act support\nends are identified; (iii)\nthere is\nan awareness of information concerning similar programs, relevant research\nfindings, and views of recognized experts. The solution offers potential for\nimproving existing programs and practices. The programs and practices to be\nchanged or replaced are clearly identified; (iv)\nthe project is innovative, i.e., new to\nthe district; (v) there is a close\nrelationship of the proposed program to the educational thrusts of the State as\npreviously established; (vi)\nthe\nprogram is likely to receive wide acceptance in similar educational\nsettings; (vii)\nthere is evidence\npresented that the cost of adopting the program in other districts, after\ndevelopment in the developer district, is a reasonable one; (viii)\nthe district agrees to serve as a\ndemonstration district if the project is validated. (3)\n\nValidation grants are one to two-year\ngrants to cover evaluation costs for the purpose of validating an already\nexisting program where there is not enough hard data for validation, and where\nit is believed the program might meet a priority need and meet validation\nstandards. If appropriate, the applicant agrees to serve as a demonstrator if\nsuccessfully validated. (4)\n\nCriteria for validation grant applicants: (i) determine and document the effectiveness/success of the program in\noperation; (ii)\nprovide adequate\ninformation on the resource specifications of the ongoing program in such\nprogram areas as start-up costs, management costs, and operational costs per\nlearner and per total program; (iii)\nprovide evidence of the ongoing\nprogram's exportability, i.e., evidence that the ongoing program or practice is\nfeasible to communicate to other school districts and can be adopted/adapted by\nother school districts with similar needs and environments. (5)\n\nDemonstration grants are given\nto validated programs to enable them to inform, assist, and train potential\nadopters. In general, any validated program is eligible for a demonstration\ngrant. Which ones are funded will depend on needs and priorities. Those having\ndeveloper grants will not have an obligation to disseminate. This will take\nplace only on separate grants after validation. These grants may run from one\nto three years depending upon their success and effectiveness. (6)\n\nCriteria for demonstration grants. Though\nthe validation exercise will have determined subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iv)\nof this paragraph, the program or practice to be demonstrated will be judged\nwhether it is exemplary, as generally characterized by: (i) the extent the proposed demonstration\nprogram constitutes a comprehensive means of meeting a critical local or\nstatewide educational need that is common to all or several school\ndistricts; (ii)\nthe extent of the\navailability of those components required to implement the approach, including\nmaterial products, training, detailed documentation regarding needs addressed, target population characteristics, staffing, institutional setting, parent and\ncommunity involvement, objectives, procedures, activities, evaluation design, outcomes, and costs; (iii)\nthe\nextent to which a wide range of school districts would find the approach\npracticable for adoption/adaption relative to instructional methodology, materials, equipment and facilities, management scheduling, and\nassessment; (iv)\nthe availability\nof statistically significant evidence that in any previous implementation of\nthe approach with comparable groups, the approach demonstrated a high degree of\nsuccess in the achievement of its major objectives, and has been formally\nvalidated. (7)\n\nReplication supplementary grants are small grants to aid a district, especially\nthe less-able-to-compete, to adopt or adapt a national (JDRP) or State\ndemonstration project. These grants pay start-up costs and, generally, not\noperating costs. They test whether validated (developer-demonstrator) projects\nare actually transferable. These are scattered among the various regions and\ntypes of districts in the State. (8)\n\nCriteria for replication supplementary\ngrants: (i) the extent to which the applicant\nagency provides evidence that it has a concentration of students with\ndeficiencies in the area of the educational practice to be\nadopted/adapted; (ii)\nthe extent to\nwhich the district can provide the necessary human and material resources using\nlocal (or State) funds to implement the exemplary program; (iii)\nthe extent to which the application\ndescribes a workable plan for adopting/adapting the exemplary\nprogram; (iv)\nthe extent to which\nthe application presents a cohesive plan to initiate evaluation of the effect, implementation and design of the exemplary program, meeting the standards for a\nvalidation grant.
