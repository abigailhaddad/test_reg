The average traffic volume is 50 vehicles\nper day or less; C. The road's\nprincipal or exclusive function is to provide access to farm and/or\nrecreational lands; and\nD. The road\ndoes not provide the only highway access to any business, residence, or center\nof farm operation. 04 Where the minimum maintenance road (or road section) is\nlong, additional signs should be placed so that motorists will encounter a sign\nat least once every two miles. 05 Additional MINIMUM MAINTENANCE ROAD signs should be\nplaced on the minimum maintenance road immediately after intersecting\nroads. Option: 06 The MINIMUM MAINTENANCE ROAD sign may be supplemented\nwith a Distance plaque (see Section\n2C.55\n) where the minimum\nmaintenance road (or road section) is 1000 feet long or\nlonger.
