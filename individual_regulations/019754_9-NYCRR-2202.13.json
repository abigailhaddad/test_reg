  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2202.13 - Fuel cost adjustments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) As of\n\nJune 14, 2019, fuel pass-along to tenants under rent control is prohibited. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, rule, regulation, charter or\nadministrative code, tenants of housing accommodations which are subject to\nrent control under this chapter shall not be subject to a fuel adjustment or\npass-along increase in rent and any such increase to such tenant shall be null\nand void. (b) The basis for the\n1980 rent increases shall be as follows: (1)\n\nThe heating fuel price increase for the period April 9, 1979 through December\n31, 1979 for the particular type of fuel used by the landlord in the building, multiplied by 75 percent of the lesser of: (i) the amount of heating fuel actually\ndelivered for the building between January 1 and December 31, 1979, divided by\nthe number of rooms in the building to determine the annual fuel consumed per\nroom; or\n(ii)\nthe annual maximum\nfuel consumption standard per room for such particular type of fuel, as\npromulgated by the city in 1980. (2)\n\nSuch 1979 fuel consumption standard shall\nnot exceed 230 gallons per room in buildings using heating oils for heat, with\ncomparable unit limitations to be established by the Division of Housing and\n\nCommunity Renewal for other types of heating fuels. (3)\n\nThe annual fuel cost increase per room\nshall be divided by 12 to determine the monthly fuel cost increase per room, and that amount shall be multiplied by the number of rooms in each apartment to\ndetermine the monthly rent increase. (4)\n\nIn determining the number of rooms in the\nentire building for the purposes of this section, stores, offices and other\ncommercial units shall be assigned the same room count as an equivalent area of\nresidential space. Only living rooms, kitchens over 59 square feet in area, dining rooms and bedrooms shall be considered rooms. Bathrooms, foyers, kitchenettes, kitchens 59 square feet or less in area, alcoves, pantries and\nclosets shall not be considered rooms. (c) The basis for rent adjustment for 1981\nand each year subsequent thereto for the period January 1, 1980 to and\nincluding December 31, 1980, and annually thereafter, shall be as follows: (1)\n\nThe heating fuel price increase or\ndecrease promulgated by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal for the\nparticular type of heating fuel for the year immediately preceding the service\nand filing of the report required under this section, multiplied by the amount\nof fuel actually delivered to the building during that particular year, and\ndivided by the number of rooms determined in the manner set forth in paragraph\n(c)(4) of this section. (2)\n\nCommencing January 1, 1981, the 1980 annual standard of fuel consumption for\nbuildings using heating oils for heat shall be no more than 225 gallons per\nroom per year, with comparable unit limitations for other types of heating\nfuels. Such consumption standards for heating oils, with comparable unit\nlimitations for other types of heating fuels, shall be further reduced as\nfollows: (i) commencing January 1, 1982, by\nfive gallons per room per year for heating oils; (ii)\ncommencing January 1, 1983, by 10\ngallons per room per year for heating oils; and\n(iii)\ncommencing January 1, 1984, by 10\ngallons per room per year for heating oils. (3)\n\nSeventy-five percent of the annual fuel\ncost increase per room shall be allocated among the apartments in the manner\nset forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. (d) If the report is served and filed within\n60 days of the date of promulgation of the findings of fuel price increase and\nstandards of consumption by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the\nrent adjustment shall be retroactive to and shall become effective as of\n\nJanuary first of the calendar year in which the report is filed. If the report\nis not served and filed within such period, the rent increase shall become\neffective on the first day of the month immediately following the service and\nfiling. No more than one report may be served or filed within any calendar\nyear. Where a landlord has obtained one or more rent adjustments under this\nsection and there is a finding of fuel price decrease, and the landlord fails\nto serve and file a report of rent decrease within 60 days of the promulgation\nof findings, the landlord shall lose all right to collect any rent adjustments\ngranted under this section for a period of 12 months, and the rent decrease\nshall be retroactive and effective January first of the calendar year in which\nthe finding was promulgated. (e) Renumbered. (f) A landlord who\nfiled a report under this section containing a false certification shall not be\nauthorized nor eligible to collect any rent adjustment under this section for\ntwo years following the date of the order of determination of a false\ncertification and, in addition, any rent adjustment obtained within two years\nprior to such determination shall not be effective nor collectible for the same\ntwo-year period following the date of the determination. Such landlord shall\nalso be subject to any additional penalties imposed by law, including but not\nlimited to the refund of any increases obtained by a false certification under\nthis section. (g) No increase\nprovided for in this section shall be collectible from a tenant to whom there\nhas been issued a currently valid senior citizen rent increase exemption order, insofar as it exceeds one third of the tenant's monthly disposable income. A\nsenior citizen who applies for a rent increase exemption shall receive an order\nretroactive to the effective date of the annual fuel cost increase adjustment\nimmediately preceding such application. (h) In the event a rent reduction order, based upon the landlord's failure to provide heat or hot water to housing\naccommodations for which a landlord is collecting a rent adjustment provided\nfor in this section, is issued by the Division of Housing and Community\n\nRenewal, such rent adjustment shall not be authorized nor collected for the\ntime such rent reduction order remains in effect. In addition, the landlord\nshall not be authorized nor eligible to collect (1) such rent adjustment and\n(2) any subsequent rent adjustment provided for in this section, until 12\nmonths after the effective date of the order restoring the maximum rent and\nterminating the rent reduction. (i) The increase provided pursuant to this section shall not be incorporated into\nthe maximum base rent or the maximum collectible rent for purposes of\ncalculating percentage adjustments to such rents. (j) A landlord demanding or collecting a rent\nadjustment provided for in this section shall, at the time of either the demand\nor collection of rent, issue to the tenant a rent bill or receipt setting forth\nthe amounts of any fuel cost adjustments separate from the amount of rent\notherwise demanded or collected. If the tenant has been issued a currently\nvalid senior citizen rent increase exemption order, the landlord shall also\nstate the amount actually payable by the senior citizen after crediting the\nexemption. (k) Any rent adjustment\ngranted pursuant to this section shall be reduced by an amount equal to any\ngovernmental grant received by the landlord compensating him for any fuel price\nincrease, prorated for all rental space for which the grant was given or\nlimited; provided, however, that such grant is not required, by the city, the\nagency or any governmental entity, to be expended for fuel- related repairs or\nimprovements.
