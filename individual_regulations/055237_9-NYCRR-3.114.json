  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.114 - Executive order no. 114: establishing an executive advisory commission to review existing laws affecting the authority and operations of new york insurance companies\n\nState Regulations\n\nCurrent provisions of the New York Insurance Law place\nrestrictions on the authority, operations and practices of New York domestic\ninsurance companies. The last complete revision of the provisions, which\noccurred in 1940, was based on a philosphy for New York insurance companies\nwhich may no longer be appropriate in view of major developments in the\nfinancial marketplace. The insurance industry has been a major contributor to the\n\nState's economy. It is therefore appropriate that the provisions of the New\n\nYork Insurance Law be reviewed to determine if they are responsive to current\neconomic conditions, keeping in mind the need to protect policyholders and\nrecognizing the importance of the insurance industry's ability to stimulate the\neconomy and provide and maintain employment opportunities for the citizens of\nthe State. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby establish an Executive Advisory Commission\non Insurance Industry Regulatory Reform (the \"Executive Advisory Commission\")\nto review existing policy and laws affecting New York insurance\ncompanies. I. Powers and\n\nResponsibilities. The Executive Advisory commission shall: identify and evaluate existing provisions of the New York\n\nInsurance Law relating to investments, practices and permitted operations of\n\nNew York insurance companies; develop and recommend to the Governor necessary changes in\nsuch provisions and regulation policies consistent with protection of\npolicyholders and the economic well-being of New York insurance companies and\nthe State; recommend to the Governor necessary legislation to\nimplement the policy and philosophy developed by the Commission; and\nsubmit to the Governor an interim report by February 15, 1982, and a final report by May 1, 1982, which shall set forth the Commission's\nrecommendations and contain any factual and statistical data gathered by the\ncommission. II. Membership. The members of the Executive Advisory Commission shall be\nappointed by the Governor, who shall also designate the chairperson. The\nmembers of the Commission shall receive no compensation but shall be entitled\nto reimbursement for any necessary expenses incurred in connection with the\nperformance of their duties. The Commission may request and shall receive from any\ndepartment, division, board, bureau, commission or agency of the State such\nassistance and data as will enable it properly to carry out its powers and\nresponsibilities hereunder. Signed: Hugh L. CareyDated: October 29, 1981\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n3.114\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
