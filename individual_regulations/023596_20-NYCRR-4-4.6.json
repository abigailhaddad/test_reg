  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-4.6 - Reasonable approximation based on general information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where, after meeting the requirements of\ndue diligence, a corporation lacks sufficient information to use the rules for\nreasonable approximation based on customer information to determine where the\ncustomer receives the benefit of the service or other business activity, the\ncorporation must use reasonable approximation based on general\ninformation. (b) Definition. Reasonable approximation based on general information is an alternative method\nused to determine the location at which a customer receives the benefit of a\nservice or other business activity in instances in which a general information\nmeasurement, such as the general population, a subset of the general\npopulation, or some other general metric reasonably reflects the geographic\ndistribution of where the customer receives the benefit. (c) Application of reasonable approximation\nbased on general information. (1)\nA\ncorporation must use statistical information based on an appropriate\nmeasurement that reasonably approximates the location where customers receive\nthe benefit of the service or other business activity. (2)\n\nIn any case in which the commissioner\ndetermines that the corporation's method of approximation is not reasonable, the commissioner may substitute the use of a method that the commissioner\ndetermines is appropriate. In this instance, the corporation bears the burden\nof demonstrating that the method the commissioner prescribes is not\nreasonable. (3)\n\nIn any case in\nwhich the commissioner determines that the corporation's method of\napproximation is reasonable, but that it has not been applied in a consistent\nmanner with respect to similar transactions, the commissioner must require that\nthe corporation apply its method of approximation in a consistent\nmanner. (d) In any case\nin which the corporation does not have sufficient information to reasonably\napproximate based on general information, the corporation must instead\napportion the receipt using the delivery destination method (see section\n4-4.7\nof this Subpart). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n4-4.6\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
