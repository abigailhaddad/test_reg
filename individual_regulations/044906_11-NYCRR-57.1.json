  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 57.1 - Purpose and applicability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The purpose of this Part is to establish standards and rules for classifying an insured as a smoker or a nonsmoker and for reclassifying an insured in accordance with section\n57.5\n(d) of this Part and permit the use of mortality tables that reflect differences in mortality between smokers and nonsmokers in determining minimum cash surrender values, minimum amounts and minimum periods of paid-up nonforfeiture benefits, and minimum reserve liabilities for plans of insurance with separate premium rates for smokers and nonsmokers. This Part, as amended, clarifies that if an insurer issues coverage to an insured not underwritten as a smoker at issue then the insurer may not subsequently treat the insured as a smoker for that coverage. (b) This Part applies to every authorized life insurance company and authorized fraternal benefit society. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n57.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
