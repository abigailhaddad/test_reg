Tit. 12 §§ 23-4.4 - Sheeting, shoring and bracing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where any excavation is not protected by sloped sides or banks in compliance\nwith Table I of this Subpart, any person in such excavation shall be protected\nby sheeting, shoring and bracing in compliance with Tables II, III and IV of\nthis Subpart. Sizes of materials listed in the tables are nominal or trade\ndimensions. TABLE II\nMAXIMUM HORIZONTAL DISTANCE BETWEEN EDGES OF\nSHEETING\nExcavation\n\nDepth\n\nType of Soil\n5 to 10 ft. Over 10 to 15\nft. Over 15 to 20\nft. Stiff cohesive soil\n\nTight\n\nTight\n\nTight\n\nNoncohesive soil\n2 feet\n\nTight\n\nTight\n\nSoft cohesive or wet flowing soil\n\nTight\n\nTight\n\nTight\n(b) Shores, struts and braces, whether\nhorizontal or inclined, shall be of adequate size to provide stiffness and\nadequately braced to withstand the loads intended to be imposed thereon. The\nends of all braces shall be individually anchored and fastened to fully resist\nall imposed forces and to prevent such braces from shifting or slipping. The\nplacing of any inclined shores, struts or braces at any angle exceeding 30\ndegrees from the horizontal is prohibited. (c) Each earth-supported shore, strut or\nbrace shall bear against a footing of sufficient area and stability to prevent\nany subsidence, yield or shifting of such shore, strut or brace. TABLE III\nMINIMUM SIZES OF STRINGERS AND BRACES\nNarrow Trenches-Horizontal Cross-Braces Not Longer\n\nThan Four Feet\n\nTrench\n\nDepth\n\nType of\n\nSoil\n\nVertical Spacing\nof Stringers\n\nHorizontal Spacing\nof Cross-Braces\n4 Feet\n6 Feet\n\nStringers\n\nBraces\n\nStringers\n\nBraces\n\nStringers\n\nBraces\n\nStringers\n\nBraces\n5 to 10 ft.

For any trench over 20 feet in depth\nthe sheeting, shoring and bracing systems shall be designed by a professional\nengineer licensed to practice in the State of New York. A copy of the plans and\nspecifications for any such bracing system shall be kept at the job site\navailable for examination by the commissioner. * Sizes of timber for such conditions become excessive. A\nspecial structure designed by a professional engineer licensed to practice in\nthe State of New York shall be constructed and used for the specific condition\ninvolved. Note: Timber sizes are nominal or trade\ndimensions. (d) Each end of\neach stringer shall be individually braced. Where stringers are terminated to\nform individual panel type sheeting, each such panel shall be braced at either\nend. (e) In lieu of sheeting and\nshoring and where conditions permit, a self-supporting movable shield of timber\nor metal may be used and moved ahead as the excavation and construction\nprogresses. The supporting capacity of such a shield shall be equal in all\nrespects to the sheeting and shoring set forth in Tables II, III and IV of this\n\nSubpart. When any person is located in such excavation at any point not\nprotected by such shield, sheeting and shoring as set forth in Tables II, III\nand IV of this Subpart shall be provided. (f) In lieu of wood, screw jacks of adequate\nsize and stability may be used as cross bracing in the sheeting and shoring of\nany excavation. Any type of cross bracing used shall be in a true horizontal\nposition, shall be securely fastened and shall be prevented from shifting or\nslipping by adequately fastened scabs or blocks. (g) When the depth of an excavation requires\nthe use of two vertical lengths of sheeting, one above the other, the lower\nsheeting shall be set inside the bottom stringers of the upper sheeting and\nshall be driven down and braced as the excavation continues. (h) Excavations which are generally parallel\nto existing underground pipe lines, utilities or structures of any kind shall\nbe tightly sheeted and shored alongside such pipe lines, utilities or\nstructures where they are exposed by such excavations. (i) Timber sheeting shall consist of\nstructurally sound hardwood at least two inches by six inches in size or of\nlumber of equivalent strength. The actual thickness of such timber sheeting\nshall be consistent with the size of the supporting timbers and the depth of\nthe excavation. Footnotes\n* Sizes of timber for such conditions become excessive. A\nspecial structure designed by a professional engineer licensed to practice in\nthe State of New York shall be constructed and used for the specific condition\ninvolved. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n23-4.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
