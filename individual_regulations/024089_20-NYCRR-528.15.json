  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 528.15 - Motor vehicles sold by a husband or wife to his or her spouse, or by a parent to his or her child, or by a child to his or her parent\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1115(a)(14)\n(a) Exemption. The sale of a motor vehicle by the owner to his or her\nspouse, parent or child is exempt from sales or use tax; however, this\nexemption shall not apply if the vendor is a dealer. (b) Definitions. (1)\nA\nmotor vehicle, for the\npurposes of this section, is defined in accordance with section\n125\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law. It\nexcludes trailers but includes every vehicle operated or driven upon a public\nhighway which is propelled by any power other than muscular power, except: (i) electrically driven invalid chairs being\noperated or driven by an invalid; (ii)\nvehicles which run only upon rails or\ntracks; and\n(iii)\nsnowmobiles. (2)\nA\ndealer\nis defined, in accordance with section\n415\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law, as a\nperson engaged in the business of buying, selling or dealing in motor vehicles, motorcycles or trailers other than mobile home trailers, at retail or\nwholesale. Any person who sells or offers for sale more than five motor\nvehicles, motorcycles or trailers in any calendar year or who displays or\npermits the display of three or more motor vehicles, motorcycles or trailers\nfor sale at any one time or within any one calendar month upon premises owned\nor controlled by him, if such vehicles were purchased, acquired or otherwise\nobtained by such person for the purpose of resale, will be regarded as a\ndealer. Example 1: A husband and wife each own a motor vehicle. They exchange\ncars as the husband intends to trade in his wife's car for a new one. The\nexchange of cars between husband and wife is for a consideration (car for car)\nand is not a gift. A sales tax would ordinarily be due on both vehicles, but as\nit is an exchange between a husband and wife the exemption applies. Example 2: A parent purchases an automobile, for his child's use; title is in the parent's name. A year later, the child assumes payment of the\nnote, and title is transferred to him. A sales tax would ordinarily be due on\nthe transfer of a car in exchange for the assumption of liabilities; but as\nthis is a transaction between a parent and a child, the exemption\napplies.

Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
