INSERT the following paragraphs: Option: 01A Bike Route Guide (D11-1) signs may be used to guide\nbicyclists along an unnumbered bicycle route that is part of a small local\nsystem, or that connects two places between which bicycle travel is\ncommon. Support: 01B Bike Route Guide signs are not intended for use along\nresidential streets where bicycle travel patterns are random, or where guidance\nfor bicyclists is unnecessary. 01C Bike Route Guide signs do not alter statutory\nprovisions about bicyclists' rights to travel on highways, paths, and trails, nor do they alter the rules for bicycle operation. Standard: 04A Bicycle Destination (D1-1b, D1-1c, D1-2b, D1-2c, D1-3b, D1-3c) signs shall not contain destination information that can also apply to\nother road users. When used on roadways, Destination (D1-1, D1-1a) and Street\n\nName (D3) signs shall be the sizes indicated in Table 2D-1. Guidance: 05A The use of horizontal separator lines should be limited\nto instances where it is deemed necessary to emphasize the presence of\nindependent messages appearing on the same sign face. On most Destination\nsigns, adequate separation of destinations should be accomplished through the\nspacing of lines of legend. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n9B.20\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
