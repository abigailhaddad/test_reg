(See section\n270.2\n[B]\n[14]\nof this Title, \"Standards of inmate\nbehavior, rule series 113 contraband.\")\n\nNote: The visitor's intent shall be controlling. At times, innocent oversights will occur (e.g., medication). Officers should use their\ndiscretion in judging a visitor's intent, when undeclared contraband is found, as to whether the visitor intentionally attempted to introduce contraband into\nthe facility. Criteria to be considered include the visitor's demeanor, whether\nit appears that the contraband was for the visitor's personal use and was\ninadvertently left his/her pocket or handbag, and whether an effort was made to\nconceal the contraband where it would not readily be found and the visitor's\npast history. (b) Upon the discovery of contraband as\ndefined in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, the contraband shall be\nconfiscated and law enforcement officials shall be contacted. (c) Prohibited Items. Certain items are\nprohibited inside a State correctional facility. (1)\n\nCellular phones, wireless phones, pagers, laptop computers, personal digital assistants, any device with global\npositioning (G.P.S.) capabilities, any device with audio recording\ncapabilities, radios, cameras or other similar electronic devices are\nprohibited. Other items including pocketknives, alcohol and other items posted\nat the facility entrance or as directed by staff are also prohibited. (2)\nA visitor shall declare any prohibited\nitem that is not specifically authorized to be possessed in a State\ncorrectional facility, but is otherwise legally possessed (e.g., medications). The visitor shall store the items in a locker, if available, until the visitor\nleaves the facility. If no locker is available, the visitor shall remove the\nitem from the facility and secure it in an appropriate location (e.g., the\nvisitor's vehicle). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n200.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
