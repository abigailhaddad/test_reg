  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1648-3.6 - Forecast of cash requirement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each subsidy requisition submitted to anticipate a debt service payment, or\nother requirements for cash, other than for an operating deficit shall include, in an original and two copies, a forecast of cash requirements. No standard\nform is prescribed for the forecast of cash requirements, inasmuch as\nindividual situations will vary widely. A typical forecast of cash requirements\nis, however, shown as Exhibit 2 of Appendix S-13. A study of the exhibited form\nwill show that each forecast will consist of two parts, viz: a section in which\nthe cash available as of the debt service date is built up from the\nadministration fund bank balance as of the close of the most recent calendar\nquarter and the estimated net revenue, from the latter date to the debt service\ndate, after deducting from the estimated expenses for the period, the charges\nfor debt service and other major items accrued for the period, and a section\nlisting the requirements for cash for debt service and other major expenditures\nfalling due near the debt service date. (b) The forecast of a cash requirements is\nsupplemented, in a requisition for subsidy for debt service, by sheet 1 of the\nsubsidy schedule (see Exhibit 3 of Appendix S-13) in order to indicate that the\nsubsidy requested is within the amounts of the maximum State subsidy and the\nvalue of the tax exemption subsidy, respectively. The amount requested must, of\ncourse, also be within the anticipated deficit reflected in the approved\noperating budget. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1648-3.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
