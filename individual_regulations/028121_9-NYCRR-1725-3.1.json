Tit. 9 §§ 1725-3.1 - Frequency of board of directors and stockholder meetings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The board will generally meet each month, but the frequency of such meetings will be as required by the amount or nature\nof the business to be transacted or as specified in the bylaws or certificate\nof incorporation. Whenever necessary, the board shall meet to elect a president\nand such other officers as provided in the bylaws. (b) The general election of members of the\nboard shall occur at the annual stockholders meeting. Other stockholder\nmeetings shall occur as determined by the bylaws. (c) Proper notice of each meeting of the\nboard should be sent to all members of the board, including the division, at\nleast 48 hours prior to a scheduled meeting. In order to allow adequate time\nfor the division's designee to schedule attendance at the meeting of the board\nand to prepare properly for such meeting, notice of meeting of the board of\ndirectors should be sent to the division at least 10 days prior to the date of\nthe meeting where possible, together with an agenda of the meeting. (d) Stockholders should be notified at least\n10 days and not more than 60 days prior to each meeting of the stockholders. However, in accordance with the bylaws, written notice is not required if all\ndirectors, or stockholders as the case may be, are present at the meeting or\nthose not present have waived notice in writing. A majority of all\nstockholders, counted on the basis of one vote per dwelling, shall constitute a\nquorum in any stockholders' meeting, except that the certificate of\nincorporation or by-laws may allow a lesser amount to constitute a quorum, but\nnot less than one-third of such voters. Notwithstanding the above, the quorum\nrequirements set forth in Subpart 1750 of this Title shall govern all votes\nidentified in that Subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
