  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 503.3 - Interruptions of service\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Interruptions of service. Each water corporation shall make reasonable efforts\nto prevent interruptions of service. When interruption occurs, the water\ncorporation shall reestablish service within the shortest possible time period\nconsistent with the general safety and public welfare. Whenever service is to\nbe interrupted for the purpose of scheduled maintenance, this work shall be\ndone at a time which will cause the least inconvenience to customers provided\nthat the schedule is compatible with local ordinances and does not result in\nsubstantial additional costs. (b) Monitoring requirements. A record shall be kept by each water corporation of\nall interruptions to service having a duration of one hour or more, from any\ncause whatsoever, except those resulting from violation of the company's filed\ntariff regulations or customer-requested disconnections. Such records shall\ndescribe the nature, location, time, cause, extent and duration of the\ninterruption. A record of that information shall be open for public as well as\ndepartment inspection during the water corporation's normal business hours. Each water corporation shall immediately notify the fire department of each\nmunicipality affected, and upon written request of the municipality concerned\nthe police department as well, of existing and/or proposed interruptions to\nservice which may affect the continuity of service to fire flows for a period\nof one hour or longer. Where planned interruptions in water service, which are\nlikely to exceed one hour in duration are anticipated, all customers who will\nbe affected thereby shall be notified at least four hours in advance to permit\nthem to prepare for the interruption in water service. As used in this section, a planned interruption is any interruption of which the company has prior\nknowledge and which has an anticipated time and duration. This would normally\ninclude all interruptions which are not of an emergency nature. Immediate\nnotice by telephone or telefacsimile shall be given to the department by each\nwater corporation of all interruptions to, or major impairments of, service of\na duration of four hours or more which affect the continuity of service to five\nor more customers or one percent of the total number of customers served, whichever is larger, or which affect available fire flows. Notice shall also be\ngiven of any accident or damage to portions of the plant which might lead to\nsuch interruptions of service. If such interruption occurs after 4:45 p.m. and\nbefore 8:30 a.m., and notice is to be transmitted by telephone, such notice\nshall be given promptly on the next business day following the interruption. A\nwritten report of all such interruptions shall be filed with the department\nwithin five business days following that in which the interruption occurred. [FN*] Applies to all water corporations regardless of\nsize. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n503.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
