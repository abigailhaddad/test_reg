Tit. 20 §§ 9-3.1 - Apportionment rules for New York S corporations\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A)\nA New York S corporation determines the amount of\nbusiness receipts included in New York receipts or everywhere receipts using\nthe rules in section 210-A and Part 4 of this Subchapter, except as provided in\nthis Subpart. (a) The term\" business\nreceipts for a New York S corporation\" means all receipts, net income (not less\nthan zero), net gains (not less than zero), and other items described in\nsection 210-A and this Subchapter that are included in the New York S\ncorporation's non-separately computed income and loss or in the New York S\ncorporation's separately stated items of income and loss, determined pursuant\nto subdivision (a) of IRC section 1366. Business receipts for New York S\ncorporations include amounts that otherwise would have been characterized as\ninvestment income from investment capital or other exempt income for New York C\ncorporations. (b) Because a New\n\nYork S corporation does not have any investment capital or other exempt income, stock that otherwise would have been investment capital or could generate other\nexempt income for a New York C corporation as defined in section 208(1-A) may\nbe a qualified financial instrument for a New York S corporation. For purposes\nof applying the rules in section\n4-2.4\nof this Subchapter, the term\nqualified financial instrument shall have the same meaning as in section\n4-2.4, except that the instruments\nexcluded from qualified financial instruments in the case of New York S\ncorporations shall be limited to the following: (1)\nloans secured by real property; (2)\nloans not secured by real property, if\nthe only loans the taxpayer has marked to market are loans secured by real\nproperty; and\n(3)\npartnership\ninterests that do not meet the definition of security in IRC section\n475(c). (c) Global\nintangible low-taxed income (GILTI) is included in everywhere receipts only in\ninstances where the GILTI inclusion amount is computed at the entity level\nunder IRC section 951A. GILTI is not included in New York receipts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
