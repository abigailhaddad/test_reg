Tit. 9 § 181.9 - Steps a division for youth employee must take to return a youth to program\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If the youth's\nprogram is within a 25-mile radius of the worker's office of presence, the\nworker must personally accompany the youth back to program. (b) If the youth's program is beyond a\n25-mile radius of the worker's office or presence, the worker must personally\narrange travel for the youth. Division for Youth transfer agents or the\nfacility to which the youth is to be returned may be called. If Division for\n\nYouth transfer agents or facility agents are not available, the youth service\nteam worker must make the travel arrangements. The home district supervisor may\nbe contacted for assistance. If the worker has reason to believe that the youth\nwill constitute a danger to himself or others or will abscond again if he/she\ntravels along, or if the youth to be transported is an adjudicated title III\njuvenile delinquent, the worker must travel personally with the youth or find\nanother Division for Youth worker to travel with the youth. In cases where a\nyouth is likely to be disruptive or likely to try to abscond again, two workers\nshall be assigned to travel with the youth. Once travel arrangements have been\nmade, the worker must phone the facility to which the youth is to be returned\n(if a facility agent is not transporting the youth) and inform the facility of\nthe time and place of the youth's arrival. When transportation is not by\nautomobile, the worker personally must accompany the youth to the train, plane, or bus and purchase a ticket. If the worker is not traveling with the youth (as\nmay be the case for nondangerous title II youth), he/she must wait until the\nplane, train or bus has actually departed. Facility workers must be assigned to\ngo to the train, plane or bus to meet the returning youth. Facility workers\nmust arrive at the plane, train or bus depot 20 minutes prior to arrival time\nand wait at the gate of arrival. If the train, plane or bus is delayed, the\nfacility worker must wait at the gate of arrival until the train, plane or bus\ncomes in. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n181.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
