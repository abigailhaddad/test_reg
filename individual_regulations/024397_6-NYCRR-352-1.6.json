  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 352-1.6 - Guidelines for Laboratory Tests\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nfollowing method performance criteria ensure that analytical testing conducted\nto determine the concentration of 1,4-dioxane in a product or raw material is\nreliable and accurate. Provided all criteria set forth in this subdivision are\nmet, a manufacturer may utilize any analytical method to assess compliance. (1)\n\nSample preparation criteria. (i) Different sample preparation techniques\nmay be used, including but not limited to those needed for headspace, solid\nphase microextraction, and direct inject, provided that all other performance\ncriteria are met. (ii)\n\nThe product\nshould be mixed or shaken prior to sampling, as needed, to ensure the sample is\nrepresentative of the product contents. (2)\n\nMethod criteria. (i) The method must use isotope dilution with\n1,4-dioxane-d 8 as an internal standard. It is recommended that the\nconcentration of the internal standard in the sample be within the calibration\nrange of 1,4-dioxane. (ii)\nA\nsignal to noise ratio of 3:1 must be met for all 1,4-dioxane ions in all\nsamples, including calibration solutions. (iii)\n\nThe Limit of Detection should be at or\nbelow one tenth of the applicable limitation set forth in section 352-1.3 of\nthis Part. For example, for products with a limit of one part per million, the\nlimit of detection must be less than or equal to 0.1 part per\nmillion. (iv)\n\nThe Limit of\n\nQuantitation should be at or below the applicable limitation set forth in\nsection 3521.3 of this Part. (v) Methods may use full scan, selected ion monitoring, or multiple reaction\nmonitoring scanning modes to meet the limit of quantitation, depending on\navailable instrumentation. (vi)\n\nMethods must incorporate, at a minimum, one quantitation and one qualifier ion\nfor 1,4-dioxane and internal standard identification. (a) 1,4-Dioxane\n(1)\n\nQuantitation Ion: (i) For scan and select ion monitoring: 88\n(ii)\n\nFor multiple reaction\nmonitoring: 88 in the first stage; 57 in the second stage\n(2)\n\nQualifier Ion: (i) For scan and select ion monitoring: 57, 58\n(ii)\n\nFor multiple reaction\nmonitoring: 88 in the first stage; 58 in the second stage\n(b) 1,4-Dioxane-d 8\n(1)\n\nQuantitation Ion: (i) For scan and select ion monitoring: 96\n(ii)\n\nFor multiple reaction\nmonitoring: 96 in the first stage; 62 in the second stage\n(2)\n\nQualifier Ion: (i) For scan and select ion monitoring: 62, 64\n(ii)\n\nFor multiple reaction\nmonitoring: 96 in the first stage; 64 in the second stage\n(3)\n\nInstrument criteria. (i) All study samples\nmust be analyzed on a properly calibrated instrument and meet the instrument\nmanufacturers specifications. If the instrument calibrations, or other\ninstrument check requirements (i.e., mass spectrometer tune, mass calibration\ncheck, or qualitative identification criteria), are outside the acceptable\ncriteria, standard measures to correct the problem must be performed prior to\nanalyzing any sample. (ii)\n\nThe use\nof a gas chromatograph/mass spectrometer is recommended for the chromatographic\nseparation and fragmentation of analytes for identification. The ratios of\nqualifier ions should be established during calibration and must be maintained\nthroughout sample analysis to verify the identity of 1,4-dioxane and ensure\nthat there are no interfering peaks. (4)\n\nCalibration. (i) The instrument tune check must be done\nprior to calibration. The use of 4-bromofluorobenzene tune for full scan, and\ncheck tune for select ion monitoring and multiple reaction monitoring, is\nrecommended. (ii)\n\nRetention time\nand relative retention time requirements: (a) the internal standard retention time must be within 0.33 minutes to mid-point\nof initial calibration; and\n(b) the\nanalyte retention time must be less than 0.17 minutes to mid-point of initial\ncalibration or first Continuing Calibration Verification. (iii)\n\nThe initial calibration must utilize at\nleast five non-zero calibration concentrations. The fitted line of the\ncalibration curve must have a relative standard deviation of less than or equal\nto 20 percent of the average response factor or must be linear with a\ncorrelation coefficient greater than 0.99. The lowest calibration level must be\nwithin 50 percent of its true value. (a) An\ninitial calibration verification standard solution, with a concentration at or\nnear the mid-point of the calibration curve, must be analyzed immediately\nfollowing the initial calibration and be within 30 percent of its true\nvalue. (b) A continuing calibration\nverification standard solution must be analyzed before sample analysis, after\nevery tenth analytical run, and at the end of analysis. The determined\nconcentration must be within 20 percent of the true value. If the calibration\nverification does not meet the acceptance criteria, perform any necessary\ninstrument maintenance, and inject another aliquot of the continuing\ncalibration verification solution. If the response of the analyte is still not\nwithin 20 percent of the true value, then a new initial calibration curve is\nrecommended as described in subparagraph 352-1.6(a)(4)(iii) of this\n\nPart. (iv)\n\nSolvent\nblanks should be inserted between samples with high concentration analytes to\nverify no carryover or cross contamination of 1,4-dioxane from one sample to\nthe next. (5)\n\nQuality\ncontrol. (i) All data must adhere to a\nquality control protocol and include a duplicate sample preparation and\nanalysis for each product analyzed. Quality control protocols are acceptable if\nthey incorporate steps to ensure that method blanks, analytical accuracy, and\nprecision are maintained for each run and the protocol can demonstrate a\nrelative percent difference less than or equal to 20 percent and an extraction\nrecovery between 70 and 130 percent of the expected analyte concentrations. An\nacceptable quality control protocol must include the following: ('a')\nA method blank is run with every batch\nof up to 20 samples. The concentration of 1,4-dioxane in all method blanks must\nbe less than the limit of quantitation. ('b')\nA laboratory control sample and\nlaboratory control sample duplicate preparation are analyzed with every batch\nof 20 samples and must be within 30 percent of the true value and relative\npercent difference less than or equal to 20 percent. ('c')\nA matrix spike and matrix spike\nduplicate are analyzed with every batch of 20 samples with a recovery value\nwithin 70 and 130 percent and relative percent difference less than or equal to\n20 percent. The laboratory may establish internal control limits but must not\nexceed the 70 to 130 percent recovery range. ('d')\n\nThe retention time of the analyte of\ninterest in the sample is less than ten seconds to the midpoint of the initial\ncalibration or the first continuing calibration verification. ('e')\n\nThe limit of quantitation must be\nwithin 50 percent recovery of the spiked reference concentration and relative\nstandard deviation less than or equal to 20 percent of four to seven\nreplicates.
