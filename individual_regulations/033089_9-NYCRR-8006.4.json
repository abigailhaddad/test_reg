The written findings and recommendation of the appeals unit shall\nthereupon be mailed to the incarcerated person/violator or, where the appellant\nwas represented by counsel, to the counsel for appellant. (b) Upon the issuance by the appeals unit of\nits findings and recommendation the appeal will be presented as soon as\npracticable to three members of the Board of Parole for\ndetermination. (c) Should the\nappeals unit fail to issue its findings and recommendation within four months\nof the date that the perfected appeal was received, the appellant may deem this\nadministrative remedy to have been exhausted, and thereupon seek judicial\nreview of the underlying determination from which the appeal was taken. In that\ncircumstance, the Board and Department will not raise the doctrine of\nexhaustion of administrative remedy as a defense to such litigation. (d) An appeal shall be considered by three\nmembers of the Board of Parole, except that any board member who participated\nin the decision from which the appeal was taken may not participate in the\nresolution of the appeal. The appeal shall be decided by a majority of the\nthree board members who review the appeal. (e) The three board members who review the\nappeal, or a majority thereof, may affirm, modify or reverse the\ndecision. (f) Factual\ndeterminations made by a presiding officer at a rescission hearing shall not be\nsubject to modification or reversal on appeal, unless the majority of the board\nmembers who review the appeal concludes that the factual determination was not\nsupported by a preponderance of the evidence. Factual determinations made by a\npresiding officer at a final revocation hearing shall not be subject to\nmodification or reversal on appeal, unless the majority of the board members\nwho review the appeal concludes that the factual determination was not\nsupported by clear and convincing evidence. (g) When three reviewing members of the\nboard, or a majority thereof, render a determination, reasons for such decision\nshall be provided when such decision is at variance with the recommendation of\nthe appeals unit. (h) When three\nreviewing members of the board, or a majority thereof, reverse or modify a\ndetermination, they shall direct the action to be taken, except that, should\nthey determine that the time assessment imposed at a release proceeding was\nexcessive, they shall direct a rehearing.
