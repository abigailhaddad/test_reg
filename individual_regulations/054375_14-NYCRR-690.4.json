(a) Within six months of the issuance of the\ninitial operating certificate, the facility shall submit to OPWDD a letter\ncertifying that, based on subsequent assessments of the persons admitted to the\nfacility, the staffing allocation plan as originally submitted and approved is\nadequate to meet the identified needs; or\n(b) Any substantial revisions to a facility's\noriginal staffing plan shall be submitted to OPWDD for review and\napproval. (c) If OPWDD discovers\nthat any portion of the day treatment needs of the persons admitted are not\nbeing met because of inadequate staffing, the facility shall prepare a plan of\ncorrection and implement, in a timely fashion, a staffing allocation plan that\nwill meet the identified service needs of the admitted persons. (3)\n\nThe initial and\nrenewed operating certificate may be valid for a period of up to three\nyears. (4)\n\nAn operating certificate\nshall be issued to a day treatment facility for a specific inspected site and\nits approved satellite site(s). (5)\n\nNo day treatment facility may be operated without a valid operating certificate\nissued to the agency by OPWDD. (6)\n\nThe current operating certificate shall be maintained at the facility site and\nshall be available to anyone requesting to see it. Copies of the operating\ncertificate showing the approved satellite site(s) shall be available at said\nsatellite site(s). (7)\n\nThe number\nof full-time equivalent persons (see glossary) for which the overall facility\n(including any satellite sites) has been approved for routine on-site\nattendance at any one time, shall be stated on the operating certificate as the\ncertified capacity (see glossary). (8)\n\nAll operating certificates shall remain\nthe property of OPWDD. Expired, invalidated, revoked or terminated certificates\nshall be returned to OPWDD. (9)\n\nSuspension, revocation or limitation of the operating certificate shall be in\naccordance with the provisions of article 16 of the Mental Hygiene\n\nLaw.

This notice of\nintent to voluntarily terminate operation shall include a statement of the\nactions which will be taken by the certificate holder: (i) to assure appropriate referral of persons\nbeing served; (ii)\nto preserve the\nconfidentiality of records; and\n(iii)\nto settle all outstanding debts and\naccounts receivable according to the pre-existing individual\nagreements. (11)\n\nCatastrophic termination of operation. (i) The\ncommissioner shall be notified immediately of any catastrophe. (ii)\n\nIf, through a catastrophe or other\ncircumstance beyond the facility's control, such as but not limited to fire, flood or earthquake, the facility is unable to operate as certified for a\nperiod of 60 days, the operating certificate shall be subject to suspension, revocation or limitation. Such time period shall be extended upon application\nto and approval from the commissioner. Such extension shall be granted in a\ntimely manner based on the documentation that the facility is proceeding in\ngood faith to reinitiate operation and that satisfactory service alternatives\nhave been provided for the participants in the interim. (iii)\n\nFrom the time of such catastrophe, the\nagency, in collaboration with the commissioner, shall be responsible for\nproviding emergency quarters and continuing support to all persons, until such\ntime as the facility can be made habitable or suitable alternative quarters can\nbe found. Such requirements shall be contingent upon maintenance of the current\nreimbursement agreements. (12)\n\nNo operating certificate is transferable\nor assignable to any other party or entity. (b) Standards of certification.
