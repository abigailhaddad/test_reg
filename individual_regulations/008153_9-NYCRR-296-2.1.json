  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 296-2.1 - Visitor parking in ogs parking facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Parking areas for visitors are maintained\nby OGS at the Empire State Plaza in Albany and other locations throughout the\n\nState. Visitors may park only in areas designated specifically as visitor\nparking. In most instances there will be hourly or daily fees assessed for\nvisitor parking. Fees will be conspicuously posted at the entrance of all\nvisitor parking areas. Use of the paid parking facilities operated by OGS is by\ninvitation and temporary revocable permit, which may be rescinded or withheld, where an individual operator violates any applicable rule or fails to promptly\nremit payment of those fees imposed by OGS. (b) In the case of special visitors and/or\ngroup visitors (workshop participants, etc.) appropriate arrangements must be\nmade for temporary parking privileges. Applications must be made in advance\nwith the OGS Bureau of Parking Services. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n296-2.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
