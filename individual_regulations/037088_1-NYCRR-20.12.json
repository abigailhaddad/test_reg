Such designation\nshall be effective on the first of the month after receipt by the market\nadministrator of an application containing complete information on the basis of\nwhich the market administrator determines that the requirements of subdivision\n(b) are being met. The effective date of designation shall be governed by the\ndate of filing new applications in instances where applications previously\nfiled have been denied. All designations shall remain in effect until cancelled\npursuant to subdivision (c) of this section. (a) Application. Any handler claiming to meet\nthe requirements of subdivision (b) of this section may file with the market\nadministrator, on forms prescribed by the market administrator, an application\nfor designation as a producer-handler.

(2)\nA listing and\ndiscription of all resources and facilities used for the processing or\ndistribution of milk or milk products which are owned, or directly or\nindirectly operated or controlled by the applicant. (3)\nA description of any other resources and\nfacilities used in the production, handling, or processing of milk or milk\nproducts in which the applicant in any way has an interest, including any\ncontractual arrangement, and the names of any other persons having or\nexercising any degree of ownership, management, or control in, or with whom\nthere exists any contractual arrangement with respect to, the applicant's\noperation either in his capacity as a handler or in his capacity as a dairy\nfarmer. (4)\nA listing and\ndescription of the resources and facilities used in the production, processing, and distribution of milk or milk products which the applicant desires to be\ndetermined as his milk production, processing, and distribution unit in\nconnection with his designation as a producer-handler: provided, that all milk\nproduction resources and facilities owned, operated, or controlled by he\napplicant either directly or indirectly shall be considered as constituting a\npart of the applicant's milk production unit in the absence of proof\nsatisfactory to the market administrator that some portion of such facilities\nor resources do not constitute an actual or potential source of milk supply for\nthe applicant's operation as a producer-handler. (5)\n\nSuch other information as may be required\nby the market administrator. (b) Requirements. (1)\n\nThe handler has and exercises (in his\ncapacity as a handler) complete and exclusive control over the operation and\nmanagement of a plant at which he handles milk received from production\nfacilities and resources (milking herd, buildings housing such herd, and the\nland on which such buildings are located) the operation and management of which\nalso are under the complete and exclusive control of the handler (in his\ncapacity as a dairy farmer), all of which facilities and resources for the\nproduction, processing, and distribution of milk and milk products constitute\nan integrated operation over which the handler (in his capacity as a\nproducer-handler) has and exercises complete and exclusive control. (2)\n\nThe handler, in his capacity as a\nhandler, handles no fluid milk products other than those derived from the milk\nproduction facilities and resources designated as constituting the applicant's\noperation as a producer-handler. (3)\n\nThe handler is not, either directly or\nindirectly, associated with control or management of the operation of another\nplant or another handler, nor is another handler so associated with his\noperation. (4)\n\nThe handler sells\nmore than an average of 100 quarts per day of Class I-A milk to persons in the\nmarketing area other than to other plants. (5)\n\nIn case the plant of the applicant was\noperated by a handler whose designation as a producer-handler previously had\nbeen cancelled pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, the quantity of\nfluid milk products handled during the 12 months preceding the application\nwhich was derived from sources other than the designated milk production\nfacilities and resources constituting the applicant's operation as a\nproducer-handler is less than the volume set forth for cancellation pursuant to\nparagraphs (3) or (4) of subdivision (c) of this section. (c) Cancellation. The designation as a\nproducer-handler shall be cancelled under conditions set forth in paragraphs\n(1) and (2) of this subdivision or, except as specified in paragraphs (3) and\n(4) of this subdivision, upon determination by the market administrator that\nany of the requirements of subdivision (b) of this section are not continuing\nto be met, such cancellation to be effective on the first day of the month\nfollowing the month in which the requirements were not met. (1)\n\nMilk from the designated production\nfacilities and resources of the producer-handler is delivered in the name of\nanother person as pool milk to another handler or except in the months of June\nthrough November with prior notice to the market administrator, a dairy herd, cattle barn, or milking parlor is transferred to another person who uses such\nfacilities or resources for producing milk which is delivered as pool milk to\nanother handler. This provision, however, shall not be deemed to preclude the\noccasional sale of individual cows from the herd. (2)\nA dairy herd, cattle barn, or milking\nparlor, previously used for the production of milk delivered as pool milk to\nanother handler, is added to the designated milk production facilities and\nresources of the producer-handler, except in the months of December through\n\nMay, with prior notice to the market administrator, or if such facilities and\nresources were a part of the designated production facilities and resources\nduring any of the preceding 12 months. This provision, however, shall not be\ndeemed to preclude the occasional purchase of individual cows for the\nherd. (3)\n\nIf the producer-handler\nhandles an average of more than 150 product pounds per day of fluid milk\nproducts which are derived from sources other than the designated milk\nproduction facilities and resources, the cancellation of designation shall be\neffective the first of the month in which he handled such fluid milk\nproducts. (4)\n\nIf the\nproducer-handler handles fluid milk products derived from sources other than\nthe designated milk production facilities and resources in a volume less than\nspecified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, the designation shall be\ncancelled effective on the first of the month following the third month in any\nsix-month period in which the producer-handler handled such fluid milk\nproducts: provided, that the receipt of up to an average of 10 pounds per day\nof packaged fluid milk products in the form of fluid skim milk, or of any\nvolume of other packaged fluid milk products (except milk) from pool plants, shall not be counted for purposes of this paragraph. (d) Public announcement. The market\nadministrator shall publicly announce the name, plant, and farm location of\npersons designated as producer-handlers, and those whose designations have been\ncanceled. Such announcements shall be controlling with respect to the\naccounting at plants of other handlers for fluid milk products received from\nsuch producer-handler on and after the first of the month following the date of\nsuch announcement. (e) Burden of\nestablishing and maintaining producer-handler status. The burden rests upon the\nhandler who is designated as a producer-handler (and upon the applicant for\nsuch designation) to establish through records required pursuant to section\n19.5\nthat the requirements set\nforth in subdivision (b) of this section have been and are continuing to be met\nand that the conditions set forth in subdivision (c) of this section for\ncancelation of designation do not exist.
