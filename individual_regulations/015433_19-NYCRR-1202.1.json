Tit. 19 § 1202.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In general, local governments are charged with the administration and enforcement of the\n\nUniform Code and the Energy Code. However, a local government has the option to\ndecline that responsibility by adopting a local law to that effect, in which\nevent the responsibility passes to the respective county. Counties are accorded\na similar option. If a local government and a county each exercise their\noption, the statute provides for administration and enforcement of the Uniform\n\nCode and Energy Code by the Secretary of State in the place and stead of the\nlocal government. Certain other events may also result in the administration\nand enforcement of both the Uniform Code and Energy Code by the Secretary of\n\nState. This Part establishes the procedures applicable in the circumstances in\nwhich the Secretary of State, through the Department of State (the department), will administer and enforce the Uniform Code and Energy Code in the place and\nstead of a local government or county. (b) Where the department is responsible for\nadministration and enforcement of the Uniform Code and Energy Code, it shall\nexercise its powers in a due and proper manner to extend to the public\nprotection from the hazards of fire and inadequate building construction, and\nto further the purposes of Article 11 of the Energy Law. (c) Subject to the provisions of section\n1203.2\n(e) of Part\n1203 of this Title, the department may contract directly with an individual or\nbusiness entity to perform \"building safety inspector enforcement activities\"\nor \"code enforcement official enforcement activities\" (as those terms are\ndefined in Part 1208 of this Title) on behalf of the department. Where the use\nof such services is in addition to services provided by the department, the\nowner shall pay the associated fee prescribed by this Part, including but not\nlimited to the fee associated with the third-party\nservices.
