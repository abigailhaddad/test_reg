For purposes of this subdivision, family shall, at a minimum, include a spouse and dependent children. Each health systems agency may expand the definition of family in their bylaws. The chair of the governing body shall distribute to each member and staff a copy of the annual statements submitted by all other members and staff. (2)\n\nPending matters.

(iii)\n\nProcedure. Prior to discussion or vote, all actual or potential conflicts shall be announced and, where appropriate, explained by the members holding such conflicts. In the case of disqualification, the members holding such conflicts shall absent themselves from the meeting during the period when the matter is under formal consideration unless the body, upon request of the member for good cause, by affirmative vote of the majority of those present determines to permit such member to remain. The minutes of each meeting of the body shall reflect all disclosures regarding conflicts of interest as well as the abstention from voting of the interested member. (3)\n\nAdvisory groups.
