  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 613-3.4 - Reporting, investigation, and confirmation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Reporting\nresponsibilities. The reporting requirements of subdivisions (b) and\n(e) of this section apply to the following persons: (1)\nthe facility owner; (2)\nthe tank system owner; (3)\nthe operator; (4)\nthe carrier; (5)\nany contractor in a contractual\nrelationship with the facility owner, tank system owner, or operator; (6)\nany other party and its contractors who\nhave been retained as part of a business transaction relating to the\nfacility; (7)\nany person who causes\na spill at the facility. (b) Reporting of suspected\nleaks. (1)\n\nSuspected leaks must be\nreported to the Department's Spill Hotline (800-457-7362) within two hours\nafter discovery and the procedures in subdivision (d) of this section must be\nfollowed for any of the following conditions: (i) the discovery of petroleum outside of a\nUST system at the facility or in the surrounding area (\ne.g., the presence of free product or vapors in soils, basements, sewer and utility\nlines, and nearby surface water); (ii)\nunusual operating conditions observed\n(\ne.g., the erratic behavior of petroleum dispensing equipment, the sudden loss of petroleum from the UST system, an unexplained presence of\nwater in the tank, or water in the interstitial space of secondarily contained\ntank system components), unless the tank system component is found to be\ndefective but not leaking, and is immediately repaired or replaced; or\n(iii)\nmonitoring/testing\nresults, including alarms, from a leak detection method required under\nsubdivisions\n3.3\n(a) and (b)\nof\nthis Subpart which indicate that a leak may have occurred, unless: (a) the monitoring device is found to be\ndefective, and is immediately repaired, recalibrated, or replaced, and\nadditional monitoring does not confirm the initial result; or\n(b) the alarm was investigated and determined\nto be a non-spill event (\ne.g., from a power surge or caused by\nfilling the tank during leak detection testing). (2)\n\nWhen a leak is suspected, or where\ninspections or tests required by this Part have not been performed, the\n\nDepartment may order the facility to inspect and to test the UST system or\nequipment for tightness. If the facility fails to conduct such inspections and\ntests within ten days after receipt of the Department's order, the Department\nmay conduct inspections or tests for tightness. The expenses of conducting such\ntests as ordered by the Department must be paid by the tank system\nowner. (c) Investigation due to off-site impacts. When required by the\n\nDepartment, the procedures in subdivision (d) of this section must be followed\nto determine if the UST system is the source of off-site impacts. These impacts\ninclude the discovery of petroleum (\ne.g., the presence of free\nproduct or vapors in soils, basements, sewer and utility lines, and nearby\nsurface and drinking waters) that has been observed by the Department or\nbrought to its attention by another party. (d) Leak investigation and\nconfirmation steps. Unless corrective action is initiated in\naccordance with Subpart 7 of this Part, any leak or suspected leak of petroleum\nmust be investigated using either one of the methods described in paragraph (1)\nor (2) of this subdivision or another procedure approved by the Department. The\ninvestigation must commence immediately following the reporting required under\nsubdivision (b) or (e) of this section. The investigation must be completed, and the results submitted to the Department prior to any repairs and within\nseven days after the reporting required under subdivision (b) or (e) of this\nsection. (1)\n\nSystem test. Testing must be conducted in accordance with paragraph 3.3(c)(1) or (d)(2) of\nthis Subpart to determine: whether a leak exists in the portion of the UST\nsystem (including delivery piping) suspected of leaking; and, in the case of\npetroleum reaching secondary containment, if a breach of secondary containment\noccurred. (i) If the test results indicate\nthat a leak or release has occurred, the leaking UST system must be immediately\nemptied to prevent further leaks and be: (a) promptly taken out of service in accordance with subdivision\n3.5\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart and repaired in accordance with subdivision\n3.2\n(j) of this\n\nSubpart; (b) replaced; or\n(c) permanently closed in accordance with\nsubdivision\n3.5\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (ii)\n\nIf the test\nresults indicate that a release has occurred, corrective action must also begin\nin accordance with Subpart 7 of this Part. (iii)\n\nIf the test results do not indicate\nthat a leak exists but environmental contamination is the basis for suspecting\na leak, a site check must be conducted in accordance with paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (iv)\n\nIf the test\nresults do not indicate that a leak exists and if environmental contamination\nis not the basis for suspecting a leak, further investigation is not\nrequired. (2)\n\nSite check. The presence or absence of a release must be\nmeasured where contamination is most likely to be present at the facility\n(\ni.e., in the excavation zone or at the UST system location). In selecting sample types, sample locations, and measurement methods, the\nfollowing must also be considered: nature of the type(s) of petroleum\npreviously stored in the UST system; type of initial alarm or cause for\nsuspicion; type of backfill; depth of groundwater; and other factors\nappropriate for identifying the presence and source of the release. (i) If the site check results indicate that a\nrelease has occurred, corrective action must begin in accordance with Subpart 7\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nIf the site\ncheck results do not indicate that a release has occurred, further\ninvestigation is not required. (e) Response to spills. (1)\n\nReleases must be reported to the\n\nDepartment's Spill Hotline (800-457-7362) within two hours after discovery and\ncorrective action must begin in accordance with Subpart 7 of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nSpills must be contained\nand reported to the Department's Spill Hotline (800-457-7362) within two hours\nafter discovery and the procedures in subdivision (d) of this section must be\nfollowed, unless the spill meets all of the following conditions: (i) The spill is known to be less than five\ngallons in total volume. (ii)\n\nIt is\ncontained and under the control of the spiller. (iii)\n\nIt has not reached and will not reach\nthe lands or waters of the State. (iv)\n\nIt is cleaned up within two hours after\ndiscovery. (v) The component of the\nUST system (including delivery piping) that leaked is promptly repaired in\naccordance with subdivision\n3.2\n(j) of this\n\nSubpart or replaced. (3)\n\nLeaking UST systems must be immediately emptied to prevent further leaks and\nbe: (i) promptly taken out of service in\naccordance with subdivision\n3.5\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart and repaired in accordance with subdivision\n3.2\n(j) of this\n\nSubpart; (ii)\nreplaced; or\n(iii)\npermanently closed in\naccordance with subdivision\n3.5\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart.
