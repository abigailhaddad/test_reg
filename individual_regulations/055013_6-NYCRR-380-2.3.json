  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 380-2.3 - Units of radiation dose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. As used in this Part, the units of radiation doses are: (1)\n'Gray' (Gy) is the SI unit of absorbed\ndose. One gray is equal to an absorbed dose of one joule/kilogram (100\nrads). (2)\n'Rad' is the special\nunit of absorbed dose. One rad is equal to an absorbed dose of 100 ergs/gram or\n0.01 joule/kilogram (0.01 gray). (3)\n'Rem' is the special unit of any of the\nquantities expressed as dose equivalent. The dose equivalent in rems is equal\nto the absorbed dose in rads multiplied by the quality factor (1 rem = 0.01\nsievert). (4)\n'Sievert' is the SI\nunit of any of the quantities expressed as dose equivalent. The dose equivalent\nin sieverts is equal to the absorbed dose in grays multiplied by the quality\nfactor (1 Sv = 100 rems). (b) As used in this Part, the quality factors\nfor converting absorbed dose to dose equivalent are shown in Table 1 of this\nsubdivision. TABLE 1\nQUALITY FACTORS AND ABSORBED DOSE\nEQUIVALENCIES\nType of Radiation\n\nQuality Factor (Q)\n\nAbsorbed Dose Equal to a\n\nUnit Dose\n\nEquivalent\na\nX-, gamma, or beta radiation\n1\n1\n\nAlpha particles, multiple-charged particles, fission fragments and heavy particles of unknown charge\n20\n0.05\n\nNeutrons of unknown energy\n10\n0.1\n\nHigh-energy protons\n10\n0.1\na\n\nAbsorbed dose in rad equal\nto 1 rem or the absorbed dose in gray equal to 1 sievert. (c) If it is more convenient to measure the\nneutron fluence rate than to determine the neutron dose equivalent rate in rems\nper hour or sieverts per hour, as provided in Table 1 in subdivision (b) of\nthis section, one rem (0.01 Sv) of neutron radiation of unknown energies may, for purposes of the regulations in this Part, be assumed to result from a total\nfluence of 25 million neutrons per square centimeter incident upon the body. If\nsufficient information exists to estimate the approximate energy distribution\nof the neutrons, the fluence rate per unit dose equivalent or the appropriate Q\nvalue from Table 2 of this subdivision may be used to convert a measured tissue\ndose in rads to dose equivalent in rems.
