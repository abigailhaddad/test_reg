  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 554.4 - Rotary tool drilling practices\n\nState Regulations\n(a) On all wells where rotary tools are\nemployed, and the subsurface formations and pressures to be encountered have\nbeen reasonably well established by prior drilling experience, the operator\nshall have the option of either running surface casing as provided in section\n554.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart or of cementing the production casing from below the deepest potable fresh\nwater level to the surface. In areas where the subsurface formations and\npressures to be encountered are unknown or uncertain, surface casing shall be\nrun as provided in section\n554.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (b) When surface casing is\nutilized, it shall be cemented by the pump and plug or displacement method with\nsufficient cement to circulate to the top of the hole. Drilling shall not be\nresumed until the cement has been permitted to set in accordance with prudent\ncurrent industry practices. (c) In\nareas where the subsurface formations and pressures have been reasonably well\nestablished by prior drilling experience, the use of blowout equipment shall be\nin accordance with the established local practice. In areas where the\nsubsurface formations and pressures are unknown or uncertain, all rotary\ndrilled wells shall be equipped with blowout equipment maintained in good\nworking condition at all times as follows: (1)\na master gate valve or its\nequivalent; (2)\na blowout\npreventer; (3)\na flowline equipped\nwith a shutoff valve of adequate size and working pressure. (d) If it is elected to complete a\nrotary-drilled well and production casing is run, it shall be cemented by a\npump and plug or displacement method with sufficient cement to circulate above\nthe top of the completion zone to a height sufficient to prevent any movement\nof oil or gas or other fluids around the exterior of the production casing. In\nsuch instance, operations shall be suspended until the cement has been\npermitted to set in accordance with prudent current industry\npractices. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n554.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
