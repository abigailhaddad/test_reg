Such\nvalues are referred to as Aesthetic (Water Source) values and shall be derived\nbased on an evaluation of reported levels of the substance that affect the\naesthetic quality of the water. Values derived shall not exceed the value of a\n\nSpecific MCL that is based on aesthetic considerations. (b) Protection of the best usage of fishing\nshall include standards and guidance values to prevent tainting of aquatic\nfood, including but not limited to taste, odor, and discoloration. Such values\nare referred to as Aesthetic (Food Source) values and derived based on an\nevaluation of reported levels of the substance that affect the aesthetic\nquality of the fish flesh, aquatic life, wildlife, or livestock that are\nconsumed by humans and that acquire such flavor, odor, or color because of\nhabitation in, passage through, or ingestion of waters. (c) If the available data are deemed\ninsufficient for deriving a value based on subdivision (a) or (b) of this\nsection, a value may be established based on chemical correlation to a chemical\nfor which a standard or guidance value has been established pursuant to that\nsubdivision, if similar aesthetic considerations are anticipated because of\nsimilarity of functional groups or metabolic or toxicologic pathways.
