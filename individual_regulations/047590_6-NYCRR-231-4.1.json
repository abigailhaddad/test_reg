  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-4.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Unless\notherwise defined in this section, the general definitions of Parts 200 and 201\nof this Title apply. (b) For the\npurposes of this Part the following definitions also apply: (1)\n'Actual emissions'. For the purposes of\ndetermining the baseline concentration, and the calculation of air quality\nimpacts according to section\n231-12.2\nof this Part, the actual\nrate of emissions of a regulated NSR contaminant from an emission source, as\ndetermined in accordance with the following subparagraphs: (i) actual emissions as of a particular date\nshall equal the rate at which the emission source actually emitted the\nregulated NSR contaminant during the 24 consecutive month period which precedes\nthe particular date and which is representative of normal emission source\noperation. The department will allow the use of a different time period upon a\ndetermination that it is more representative of normal facility operation. Actual emissions shall be calculated using the emission source's actual\noperating hours, production rates, and types of materials processed, stored, or\ncombusted during the selected time period; (ii)\nthe department may presume that facility\nspecific allowable emissions for the emission source are equivalent to the\nactual emissions of the emission source; and\n(iii)\nfor any emission source that has not\ncommenced operation on the particular date, actual emissions shall equal the\npotential to emit of the emission source on that date. (2)\n'Adverse impact on visibility'. Visibility impairment which interferes with the management, protection, preservation or enjoyment of the visitor's visual experience of the Federal\nclass I area. This determination must be made on a case-by -case basis taking\ninto account the geographic extent, intensity, duration, frequency and time of\nvisibility impairment. (3)\n'Allowable emissions'. This definition applies only for the purposes of\ndetermining the baseline concentration and the calculation of air quality\nimpacts according to section\n231-12.2\nof this Part. The emission\nrate of a facility calculated using the maximum rated capacity of the facility\n(unless the facility is subject to permit conditions which restrict the\noperating rate, or hours of operation, or both) and the most stringent of the\nfollowing: (i) the applicable standards as\nset forth in 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) parts 60 and 61; or\n(ii)\nthe applicable State implementation plan\nemissions limitation, including those with a future compliance date; or\n(iii)\nthe emission rate\nspecified in a permit condition, including those with a future compliance\ndate. (4)\n'Baseline\nactual emissions'. The annual rate of emissions of a regulated NSR contaminant\nfrom an emission source determined as follows: (i) The average rate (as defined in clauses\n('a'), ('b'), ('c'), ('d'), and ('e') of this subparagraph), in tpy, at which\nan emission source physically emitted the contaminant during its baseline\nperiod, determined by using the source's actual operating hours, production\nrates, and types of materials processed, stored, or combusted during the\nselected baseline period. ('a')\n\nThe average\nrate includes fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable if the facility\nbelongs to one of the source categories listed in section\n201-2.1\n(b)(21)(iii)\nof this Title, and emissions associated with startups, shutdowns, and\nmalfunctions. ('b')\n\nThe average rate\nmust be adjusted downward to exclude any non-compliant emissions that occurred\nwhile the emission source was operating above any applicable emission\nlimitation. ('c')\n\nExcept for\nelectric utility steam generating units, the average rate must be adjusted\ndownward to exclude any emissions that exceeded an emission limitation with\nwhich the emission source must currently comply, had such emission source been\nrequired to comply with such limitations during the baseline period. However, if an emission limitation is part of a maximum achievable control technology\nstandard that the administrator proposed or promulgated under 40 CFR part\n63, the baseline actual emissions rate need only be adjusted if the State has taken\ncredit for such emissions reductions in an attainment demonstration or\nmaintenance plan consistent with the requirements of\n40 CFR\n51.165(a)(3)(ii)(G). For the\npurposes of a creditable emission increase or emission reduction credit used\nfor netting, currently means at the time that the increase or reduction\nactually occurred. ('d')\n\nFor a\nregulated NSR contaminant, when a project involves multiple emissions sources, one baseline period must be used to determine the baseline actual emissions of\nthe emission source(s) being modified. A different baseline period cannot be\nused for each regulated NSR contaminant. ('e')\n\nFor multiple emission sources shutting\ndown or taking limits not in conjunction with a modification, a different\nbaseline period may be used for each emission source. (ii)\n\nThe applicant must use a reliable basis\nfor quantifying the baseline actual emissions. Continuous emissions monitoring\n(CEM) data or stack test data approved by the department must be used if the\nfacility is required to generate such data. Facilities required to submit\nannual emission statements in accordance with Subpart 202-2 of this Title must\nuse the same method for determining baseline actual emissions as was used for\nthe approved emission statements for the time period encompassing the baseline\nperiod, unless CEM or stack test data is available. If such data is not\navailable, acceptable bases for quantifying baseline actual emissions include, but are not limited to, E PA 's AP-42 emission factors, and fuel and solvent\npurchase records, with department approval. (5)\n'Baseline area'. Any intrastate area (and\nevery part thereof), designated as attainment or unclassifiable under section\n107 of the act, in which the major facility or NSR major modification\nestablishing the minor facility baseline date would construct or would have an\nair quality impact equal to or greater than 1 µg/m\n3\n(annual average) for NO\n2, SO\n2, or\nPM-10; or equal to or greater than 0.3 µg/m\n3\n(annual\naverage) for PM-2.5. (i) Area redesignations\nunder section 107 of the act cannot intersect or be smaller than the area of\nimpact of any major facility or NSR major modification which establishes a\nminor facility baseline date. (ii)\n\nBaseline areas pursuant to established air quality control regions (AQCR) are\navailable upon request to the department. (6)\n'Baseline concentration'. (i) The ambient concentration level that\nexists in the baseline area at the time of the applicable minor facility\nbaseline date. A baseline concentration is determined for each regulated NSR\ncontaminant for which a minor facility baseline date is established and must\ninclude: ('a')\nthe actual emissions\nrepresentative of facilities in existence on the applicable minor facility\nbaseline date, except as provided in this subparagraph; and\n('b')\nthe allowable emissions of major\nfacilities that commenced construction before the major facility baseline date, but were not in operation by the applicable minor facility baseline\ndate. (ii)\n\nThe following\nwill not be included in the baseline concentration and will affect the\napplicable maximum allowable increase(s): ('a')\nactual emissions from any major\nfacility on which construction commenced after the major facility baseline\ndate; and\n('b')\nactual emission\nincreases and decreases at any facility occurring after the minor facility\nbaseline date. (7)\n'Baseline period'. A period of time used\nto quantify a creditable emission increase, an ERC, or project emission\npotential. The baseline period consists of any 24 consecutive months within the\nfive years immediately preceding the date identified below (if less than 24\nconsecutive months of operation exist, this period of operation must be used as\nthe baseline period): (i) for a creditable\nemission increase which has physically occurred, the date of the occurrence of\nthe emission increase; (ii)\nfor an\nERC which has physically occurred, the date of the occurrence of the emission\nreduction; (iii)\nfor a creditable\nemission increase or an ERC which is scheduled to occur in the future, the date\nof receipt by the department of the permit application which proposes to use\nthe creditable emission increase or ERC; (iv)\nfor the calculation of project emission\npotential of a modification, the date of receipt by the department of a permit\napplication for the modification; or\n(v) for a facility which fails to submit a\npermit application for a NSR major modification and begins actual construction\nof such modification, the department will determine an appropriate baseline\nperiod.

(32)\n'Nonattainment contaminant'. A regulated\nNSR contaminant emitted by an emission source located or proposed to be located\nin an area designated in Part 200 of this Title as nonattainment for that\ncontaminant. All of New York State is within the ozone transport region as\ndesignated by the act. Therefore, VOC and NO\nx\nare\ntreated as nonattainment contaminants statewide as precursors of ozone. PM-2.5\nprecursors are treated as nonattainment contaminants in areas within New York\n\nState that are designated as nonattainment for PM-2.5. (33)\n'NSR major modification'. Any\nmodification of a major facility that would equal or exceed the applicable\nsignificant project threshold of a regulated NSR contaminant in table 3, table\n4, or table 6 of Subpart 231-13 of this Part; and would result in a significant\nnet emissions increase of that contaminant from the major facility. (i) Any modification with a project emission\npotential for VOC or NO\nx\nthat equals or exceeds the\napplicable significant project threshold or any net emissions increase at a\nmajor facility that is significant for VOC or NO\nx\nshall\nbe considered significant for ozone. (ii)\n\nThis definition shall not apply with\nrespect to a particular regulated NSR contaminant when the major facility is\ncomplying with the requirements under Subpart 231-9 of this Part for a PAL for\nthat contaminant. Instead, the definition of PAL major modification shall\napply. (34)\n'Offset\nratio'.

The PAL\neffective date for a facility that undergoes a modification which increases a\nprior PAL is the date when the modification commences operation and begins to\nemit the PAL contaminant. (39)\n'PAL\neffective period'. The period beginning with the PAL effective date and ending\n10 years later or, the date of expiration of the title V permit following the\nrenewal of the title V permit which established the PAL, whichever is earlier. Thereafter, the effective period is 10 years from date of issuance of the title\nV permit. The effective period is not to exceed 10 years. (40)\n'PAL major modification'. Notwithstanding the definitions for NSR major modification and net emissions\nincrease, any modification of a facility with a PAL that causes it to emit the\nPAL contaminant at a level equal to or greater than the PAL. (41)\n'Project emission potential'. Project\nemission potential is determined only for modifications at existing facilities. (i) For each regulated NSR contaminant, the\nproject emission potential must consider only the proposed emission increases\nand is calculated as the sum of the following: ('a')\nfor new emission sources, the potential\nto emit of each emission source; and\n('b')\nfor existing emission sources at a\nnon-major facility, the difference between the baseline actual emissions and\nthe potential to emit of the emission source; or\n('c')\nfor existing emission sources at a\nmajor facility, the difference between the baseline actual emissions and the\nprojected actual emissions of the emission source. (ii)\n\nProject emission potential does not\ninclude secondary emissions. (iii)\n\nFugitive emissions are not included in the project emission potential unless\nthe facility belongs to one of the source categories listed in section\n201-2.1\n(b)(21)(iii)\nof this Title. (iv)\n\nFor emergency\npower generating stationary internal combustion engines, the project emission\npotential will be based on a maximum of 500 hours of operation per year per\nengine unless a more restrictive limitation exists in a permit or\nregistration. (42)\n'Projected actual emissions'. The maximum annual rate, in tpy, at which an\nexisting emission source is projected to emit a regulated NSR contaminant in\nany one of the five years (12-month period) following the date the source\ncommences operation after a modification, or in any one of the 10 years\nfollowing that date if the project involves increasing the emission source's\ndesign capacity or its potential to emit that regulated NSR contaminant and\nfull utilization of the emission source would result in exceeding the\napplicable significant project threshold in table 3, 4 or 6 of Subpart 231-13\nof this Part or a significant net emissions increase at the major facility. Projected actual emissions are calculated only for existing major facilities. (i) In determining the projected actual\nemissions as defined in this section (before beginning actual construction), the owner or operator of the major facility: ('a')\nmust consider all relevant information, including but not limited to, historical operational data, the facility's own\nrepresentations, the facility's expected business activity and the facility 's\nhighest projections of business activity, the facility's filings with the State\nor Federal regulatory authorities, and compliance plans under the approved\n\nState Implementation Plan; ('b')\nmust include fugitive emissions to the extent quantifiable if the facility\nbelongs to one of the source categories listed in section\n201-2.1\n(b)(21)(iii)\nof this Title, and emissions associated with startups and shutdowns; and\n('c')\nmay exclude, in\ncalculating any increase in emissions that results from the particular project, that portion of the emission source's emissions following the project that the\nexisting emission source could have accommodated during the consecutive\n24-month period used to establish the baseline actual emissions and that are\nalso unrelated to the particular project. (ii)\n\nIn lieu of using the method set out in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the owner or operator of the facility may\nelect to use the potential to emit of the emission source(s), in tpy. (43)\n'Quantifiable'. A reliable\nbasis must exist for calculating the amount and the rate of the emissions\nincrease or reduction, along with a description of the characteristics of such\nincrease or reduction.

(46)\n'Secondary emissions'. Emissions of a\nregulated NSR contaminant which will occur as a result of the construction or\noperation of a proposed new or modified facility, not including emissions from\nthe proposed new or modified facility itself. Secondary emissions must be\nspecific, well defined, quantifiable, and impact the same general area as the\nproposed new or modified facility which causes the secondary emissions. Secondary emissions include regulated NSR contaminant emissions from any\noffsite support facility which would not be constructed or increase its\nemissions except as a result of the construction or operation of the proposed\nnew or modified facility. Secondary emissions do not include any emissions\nwhich come directly from a mobile source subject to any regulation under title\nII of the Clean Air Act, such as emissions from a motor vehicle or a\ntrain. (47)\n'Significant net\nemission increase'. (i) A net emission\nincrease of a nonattainment contaminant at an existing major facility that\nequals or exceeds the applicable significant net emissions increase threshold\nspecified in tables 3 and 4 of Subpart 231-13 of this Part; or\n(ii)\na net emission increase of a regulated\nNSR contaminant at an existing major facility located in an attainment area or\nunclassifiable area under section 7407 of the act that equals or exceeds the\napplicable significant net emissions increase threshold specified in table 6 of\n\nSubpart 231-13 of this Part.

An\nemission source that emits or has the potential to emit a PAL contaminant in an\namount that is equal to or greater than the significant project threshold (as\nlisted in Subpart 231-13 of this Part or in the act, whichever is lower) f or\nthat PAL contaminant, but less than the amount that would qualify the emission\nsource as a major PAL emission source. (49)\n'Source reduction'. Any practice which\nreduces emissions of a regulated NSR contaminant, other than a facility\nshutdown, emission source shutdown, curtailment, or over control of emissions\nbeyond an applicable limit.
