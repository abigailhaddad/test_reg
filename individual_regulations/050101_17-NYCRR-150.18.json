Tit. 17 § 150.18 - Directional signs permitted because of substantial economic hardship\n\nState Regulations\n\nSubsection (o) of section\n131\nof title 23, United States\n\nCode, was added by section 122 of the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1976 to\nprovide that a state may request an exemption from removal requirements of the\n\nFederal-Aid Highway Beautification Act upon a showing that removal of certain\nsigns would work a substantial economic hardship within a specific area. The\n\nDepartment of Transportation will make the application, which is permitted\nunder this provision, to the United States Department of Transportation and\nwill permit directional signs to exist in conformance with any approved\nexemption which has been granted in conformance with the Federal\nstatute.
