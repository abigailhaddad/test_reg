  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 301.4 - Administrative segregation admissions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section\napplies to the involuntary removal of an incarcerated individual from general\nconfinement and placement in a special housing unit or residential\nrehabilitation unit based upon a determination that the individual's continued\npresence in general population would pose an unreasonable and demonstrable risk\nto the safety and security of staff, incarcerated individuals, or the facility, or would present an unreasonable risk of escape. Such determination shall be\nmade by the facility superintendent, the deputy commissioner for correctional\nfacilities or their designee. (b) Within seven days after the initial determination and placement within\nadministrative segregation housing, a hearing shall be conducted pursuant to\n\nPart 254 of this Title to consider the specific reasons for administrative\nsegregation, leading to a final determination either to retain or release the\nincarcerated individual from administrative segregation. An initial written\ndetermination of the findings shall be reviewed by the deputy commissioner for\ncorrectional facilities or their designee who shall issue a final written\ndetermination to the incarcerated individual within seven days of receipt of\nthe initial determination. (c) An\nincarcerated individual in administrative segregation status shall have such\nstatus reviewed every seven days for the first two months and at least every 30\ndays thereafter to determine whether such individual's release to general\npopulation would pose an unreasonable and demonstrable risk to the safety and\nsecurity of staff, incarcerated individuals, or the facility, or present an\nunreasonable risk of escape. The review shall be performed in accordance with\nthe following procedure: (1)\nA three-member\ncommittee consisting of a representative of the facility executive staff, a\nsecurity supervisor, and a member of the guidance and counseling staff shall\nexamine the incarcerated individual's institutional record and prepare and\nsubmit to the deputy commissioner for correctional facilities or their designee\na report setting forth the following: (i) reasons why the individual was initially determined to be appropriate for\nadministrative segregation; (ii)\ninformation on the individual's subsequent behavior and attitude; and\n(iii)\nany other factors that they believe may\nfavor retaining the individual in or releasing the individual from\nadministrative segregation. (2)\n\nUpon receipt of the report and any\nwritten statement received from the incarcerated individual, the deputy\ncommissioner for correctional facilities or their designee shall forward these\ndocuments to a three-member central office committee consisting of a\nrepresentative from the office of facility operations, a member of the\ndepartment's office of special investigations, and an attorney from the office\nof counsel. The central office committee shall then complete its review and\nforward the paperwork along with its recommendation to the deputy commissioner\nfor correctional facilities. Upon receipt of the materials from the central\noffice committee, including any written statement received from the\nincarcerated individual, the deputy commissioner for correctional facilities or\ntheir designee shall document in writing whether such determination shall\ncontinue or such individual shall be released from administrative segregation, and shall state the specific facts and reasons underlying the continuance or\nrelease. (3)\n\nAs part of every\nreview, whenever a determination is made to continue the incarcerated\nindividual in administrative segregation, the deputy commissioner for\ncorrectional facilities or their designee shall provide a notice to the\nindividual that states the reason(s) for the determination and includes the\nfollowing statement: \"A determination has been made to continue your\nadministrative segregation status for the reason(s) stated in this notice. Prior to your next review, you may write to the deputy commissioner for\ncorrectional facilities or designee to make a statement regarding the need for\ncontinued administrative segregation. The reason(s) stated in this notice, any\nwritten statement that you submit, as well as your overall custodial adjustment\nwill be considered during the next scheduled review.\"\n(d) At any time, an incarcerated\nindividual may be evaluated and recommended for return to general population at\nthe current facility or transferred to another facility where it is determined\nthe incarcerated individual may be programmed into general population. Nothing\nin this subdivision shall be construed to terminate the administrative\nsegregation status of an incarcerated individual upon the individual's transfer\nto another facility, absent written authorization from the deputy commissioner\nfor correctional facilities or their designee. (e) Incarcerated individuals in\nadministrative segregation shall maintain normal property and privileges unless\nthe specific item or privilege would cause a threat to the safety and security\nof the incarcerated individual, other incarcerated individuals, staff, or the\nfacility. (f) Incarcerated\nindividuals in administrative segregation shall either be released from\nsegregated confinement or diverted to a residential rehabilitation unit, or a\nstep-down unit no later than the time limitations set forth in section\n301.1\nof this Title. (g) Incarcerated individuals in special\npopulations as defined in section\n1.5\nof this Title shall not be\nplaced in administrative segregation for any length of time. (h) Incarcerated individuals in\nadministrative segregation will not be cell-confined more than seventeen hours\nper day, other than for a facility wide emergency or the purpose of providing\nmedical or mental health treatment.
