  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 410.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 282, 289-c, 1101(b), 1102(e)\n(a) (1)\n(i) Motor fuel\nmeans\ngasoline, benzol or other product, except kerosene and crude oil, which is\nsuitable for use in the operation of a motor vehicle engine. If kerosene or\ncrude oil is compounded or mixed with any other product or products, and the\nresulting compound or mixture is suitable for use in the operation of any such\nmotor vehicle engine, such resulting compound or mixture in its entirety is\nmotor fuel. Motor fuel\nincludes, but is not limited to, gasoline, benzol, benzene, naphtha, ethanol, methanol, liquefied petroleum gas, compressed natural gas, propane gas, or any combination, or any other product, or combination of products, which is suitable for use in the operation of a\nmotor vehicle engine. (ii)\n\nHowever, any product that is not commonly or commercially known or sold as gasoline or a\nblend thereof, will not generally be considered to be suitable for use in the\noperation of a motor vehicle engine until one of the following, whichever is\nthe earliest, takes place. (a) The product is\ncompounded or otherwise mixed with any other product or products, the result of\nwhich is suitable for use in the operation of a motor vehicle engine. Example 1: A sells gasoline, as well as other petroleum products\nthat are used for industrial purposes. A also uses light naphtha and other\npetrochemicals for blending. Those additives, when compounded or otherwise\nmixed with gasoline, are motor fuel suitable for use in the operation of a\nmotor vehicle engine. A has produced additional motor fuel in this State. Consequently, A must be registered under article 12-A of the Tax Law and pay\nthe taxes imposed on such motor fuel. (b) The product is destined for use in the\noperation of a motor vehicle engine as is reasonably concluded from facts and\ncircumstances concerning such product. Example 2: B sells gasoline, gasohol and other motor fuels\nexclusively. B transports methanol to its motor fuel terminal in New York\n\nState. It can reasonably be concluded that such product is motor fuel suitable\nfor use in the operation of a motor vehicle engine. B is deemed to have\nproduced motor fuel in this State because B established the methanol as motor\nfuel. Consequently, B must be registered under article 12-A of the Tax Law and\npay the taxes imposed on such motor fuel. (c) The product is specifically designated as\na fuel suitable for use in the operation of a motor vehicle engine. Example 3: C sells a variety of denatured alcohols, including\nanhydrous ethyl alcohol. These products are primarily used by C's customers as\nsolvents and reagents. C also sells a portion of the anhydrous ethyl alcohol as\nethanol fuel. Such product is motor fuel suitable for use in the operation of a\nmotor vehicle engine when the specific designation is made. C is deemed to have\nproduced motor fuel in this State because C established the ethyl alcohol as\nmotor fuel on the sale thereof as motor fuel. Consequently, C must be\nregistered under article 12-A of the Tax Law and pay the taxes imposed on such\nmotor fuel. (d) The product\nis pumped into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle for use in the operation\nthereof on the public highways of New York State or is pumped into the fuel\ntank of a pleasure or recreational motor boat for use in the operation thereof\non the waterways of New York State, including any waterways bordering on the\n\nState. Example 4: D sells compressed natural gas for heating purposes. In\naddition, D sells such product to persons operating motor vehicles that have\nbeen specially adapted to operate on compressed natural gas. Such compressed\nnatural gas is motor fuel suitable for use in the operation of a motor vehicle\nengine when it is pumped into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle for use in the\noperation of the vehicle. D is deemed to have produced motor fuel in this State\nbecause D established the compressed natural gas as motor fuel. Consequently, D\nmust be registered under article 12-A of the Tax Law and pay the taxes imposed\non such motor fuel. (iii)\n\nMotor fuel that is suitable for use in\nthe operation of an engine of the diesel type is \"diesel motor fuel\" as defined\nin this subdivision, and as such is subject to tax as diesel motor fuel\npursuant to section\n282-a\nof the Tax Law. (2)\n(i) Diesel motor fuel\nmeans kerosene, crude oil, fuel oil or other\nmiddle distillate and also motor fuel suitable for use in the operation of an\nengine of the diesel type, excluding, however, any product specifically\ndesignated\n\nNo. 4 Diesel fuel\nand not suitable as a fuel used\nin the operation of a motor vehicle engine. (See section\n430.1\n(b) of this Title for specifications as to what constitutes No. 4 Diesel fuel not\nsuitable as a fuel in such operation.)\n(ii)\n\nKero-jet fuel\nmeans a\nquality, highly refined kerosene product or derivative thereof, which meets\nkerosene-type jet fuel specifications and which is primarily used for\ncommercial turbojet and turboprop aircraft engines. (3)\n\nAutomotive fuel\nmeans\nmotor fuel or diesel motor fuel. (b) Distributor\nfor purposes\nof this Article means: (1)\nany person, firm, association or corporation (i) importing or causing to be imported motor fuel\nfrom without the State for use, distribution, storage or sale within the State, or (ii) producing, refining, manufacturing or compounding any motor fuel within\nthe State; (2)\nany person, firm, association or corporation who or which imports or causes to be imported from\nwithout the State any motor fuel for use, distribution, storage or sale within\nthe State, even though such person or entity is a retailer selling to customers\nfor their consumption only; and\n(3)\nany person, firm, association or corporation who or which imports or causes to\nbe imported motor fuel from without the State for use, distribution, storage or\nsale within the State, even though such person or entity is a consumer as\ndistinguished from a dealer of motor fuel. (c) Imports or causes to be\nimported. (1)\nA person imports or\ncauses motor fuel to be imported into this State: (i) if such person has ownership of motor\nfuel at the time the fuel enters New York State's jurisdiction or at any time\nthereafter up to and including the offloading of such fuel; (ii)\nif such person directs or controls the\nimportation of motor fuel into New York State; or\n(iii)\nif such person purchases motor fuel\nlocated outside New York State for delivery into New York State from a seller\nwho is not registered as a distributor of motor fuel pursuant to article 12-A\nof the Tax Law. Thus, more than one party in any particular importation\ntransaction may have imported motor fuel or caused it to be imported. The act\nof importation encompasses the acts of all the parties to any New York sale\ncommencing with the bringing of motor fuel into New York State and continuing\nto the offloading of such fuel at or into any terminal, facility or land-sited\nrepository for use, distribution, storage or sale in this State. Accordingly, all persons who have ownership of motor fuel from the time it enters New York\n\nState's jurisdiction to the time it is offloaded into a terminal, facility or\nland-sited repository for use, distribution, storage or sale in the State have\ncaused such motor fuel to be imported into this State. Ownership of motor fuel\nis evidenced by such factors as title, possession, control and/or risk of loss. The absence of title will not necessarily preclude ownership of motor fuel, and\npossession, control and risk of loss are given great significance in\ndetermining ownership. Unless the circumstances of the transaction clearly\nindicate otherwise, ownership vests in the buyer when the seller completes his\nperformance under the sales contract with respect to the physical delivery of\nthe motor fuel. (2)\n\nRegardless of the indicia of ownership discussed in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, if the circumstances of an importation transaction indicate that a\nperson or persons, other than the person indicated as the owner, is directing\nor controlling the importation of motor fuel, such person or persons directing\nor controlling the importation is importing motor fuel or causing it to be\nimported into New York State. Factors indicating that a person directs and\ncontrols an importation transaction include: (i) placement of the order with the\nout-of-state supplier for the motor fuel which is the subject of the\nimportation transaction; (ii)\narranging for the transportation of the motor fuel; (iii)\nfinancing or paying for the purchase\nand/or the transportation of the motor fuel; (iv)\nfinancing the direct parties to the\ntransaction and/or conducting their business activities; and\n(v) conducting transactions between the\nparties not at arm's-length. Example 1: Ownership. A contracts with B, a New York registered\ndistributor under article 12-A, for the purchase of motor fuel located outside\nthe State. A and B agree that B will deliver the motor fuel to A's terminal in\n\nNew York. B ships the motor fuel by common carrier C to A's terminal. B has\nimported motor fuel or caused motor fuel to be imported into this State. Although C transports the motor fuel into New York, it does so only as a common\ncarrier. Example 2: Ownership. D contracts with E, a New York registered\ndistributor under article 12-A, for the purchase of motor fuel located outside\nthe State. D and E agree that D will take delivery of the motor fuel at E's\nterminal outside the State. D arranges for the transportation from E's premises\nto its New York terminal. D has imported motor fuel or caused motor fuel to be\nimported into New York State. Example 3: Directing and controlling the importation. F incorporates\na wholly owned subsidiary, G. G has only nominal assets and no employees; its\nactivities are conducted by the officers and employees of F. G purchases motor\nfuel from an out-of-state supplier and takes delivery of the fuel at the\nsupplier's out-of-state terminal. G delivers the fuel to F's terminal in New\n\nYork. F, as well as G, have imported motor fuel or caused it to be imported\ninto New York, whether or not F has directly issued payment for the fuel and/or\ntransportation. Example 4: Unregistered out-of-state supplier. H contracts with J, who is not a New York registered distributor under article 12-A, for the\npurchase of motor fuel located outside the State. H and J agree that J will\ndeliver the motor fuel to H's terminal in New York. J ships the motor fuel by\ncommon carrier to H's terminal. H, as well as J, have imported motor fuel or\ncaused motor fuel to be imported because H has purchased motor fuel located\noutside the State for delivery into the State from a seller who is not a New\n\nYork registered distributor. (3)\n\nNew York State's jurisdiction includes\n\nNew York's territorial waters. When sales or transfers of motor fuel occur when\nsuch motor fuel is on New York territorial waters prior to its being offloaded\ninto a New York land-sited facility, each of the parties to such sales or\ntransfers has caused the motor fuel to be imported into New York for use, distribution, storage or sale in this State. Additionally, if the party owning\nthe motor fuel at the time offloading into a New York land-sited facility\ncommences is not registered as a distributor of motor fuel pursuant to article\n12-A of the Tax Law, the party owning the motor fuel immediately after its\noffloading has also caused the motor fuel to be imported into New York. The\nowner of motor fuel at the time that offloading is commenced at or into any\nterminal, facility or any other land-sited repository is responsible for\npayment of the taxes with respect to such motor fuel, and, in determining the\namount of the tax, the motor fuel is to be measured by the amount of motor fuel\nwhich is offloaded into the terminal, facility or other land-sited repository. Persons owning motor fuel prior to the person owning it at the time offloading\nis commenced are not liable for the tax. If, however, the owner of the motor\nfuel at the time that offloading is commenced is not registered as a\ndistributor under article 12-A of the Tax Law, then the owner of the motor fuel\nimmediately after it is offloaded is jointly and severally liable for payment\nof the tax. (See section\n412.1\nof this Title.) In no event shall the tax be collected more than once with\nrespect to any particular importation of motor fuel. (4)\n\nMotor fuel brought into the State in the\nordinary fuel tank connected with the engine of a motor vehicle, airplane, motor boat or other conveyance propelled by the use of such motor fuel, and to\nbe used only in the operation thereof, will not be deemed imported within the\nmeaning of this definition. (d) Motor vehicle\nmeans any\nvehicle propelled by any power other than muscular, except: (1)\nboats (other than pleasure craft), (2)\nroad building machinery, (3)\npower shovels, (4)\ntractor cranes, (5)\ntractors used exclusively for\nagricultural purposes, and\n(6)\nsuch\nvehicles as are run only on rails or tracks. (e) Person\nincludes an\nindividual, copartnership, society, association, corporation, joint-stock\ncompany and any combination of individuals. Person\nalso\nincludes an executor, administrator, receiver, trustee or other\nfiduciary. (f) Purchaser\nincludes, in addition to its usual meaning, a\ndistributor who or which transfers motor fuel from stock into a motor vehicle, or into a container from which motor fuel is supplied by the distributor to a\nmotor vehicle or vehicles of the distributor or of others. (g) (1)\n\nSale\nfor purposes of article 12-A of the Tax Law by statutory\ndefinition constitutes a sale as defined in article 28 of such law. Thus in\ngeneral, a sale is any transfer of title or possession or both, exchange or\nbarter, rental, lease or license to use or consume, conditional or otherwise, in any manner or by any means whatsoever, for a consideration. (2)\n\nIn addition to the general meaning\ndescribed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, a sale also includes the\ntransfer of motor fuel by a distributor into a motor vehicle or into a\nreceptacle from which motor fuel will be supplied by the distributor to such\ndistributor's own motor vehicles or the motor vehicles of others. (3)\nA retail sale of motor fuel is any sale\nof motor fuel for purposes other than resale. (h) Use. For the purpose of the imposition of the tax, the term\nuse\nmeans the exercise of any right or power over motor fuel\nby any person, whether or not a purchaser, including but not limited to the\nreceiving, storage or any keeping or retention for any length of time, withdrawal from storage or any consumption of such motor fuel. (i) (1)\n\nTransporter\nmeans any person who or which has the use or\ncontrol, or the right to the use or control of any means of transportation used\nin transporting motor fuel, including a barge, truck or pipeline. (2)\n\nImporting transporter\nmeans any transporter who or which transports motor fuel in the State, where\nsuch motor fuel is being imported into the State for use, distribution, storage\nor sale in the State. (j) (1)\n\nTerminal\nmeans a motor fuel storage facility with a storage\ncapacity of 50,000 gallons or more, excluding such a facility at which motor\nfuel is stored solely for its retail sale at such facility. (2)\n\nTerminal operator\nmeans\nany person who or which has the use of or control over, or the right to use or\ncontrol, a terminal. (k) (1)\n\nFilling station\nmeans\nany place, location or station where motor fuel is stored for sale primarily by\ndelivery directly into the ordinary fuel tank connected with the engine of a\nmotor vehicle to be consumed in the operation of such motor vehicle. (2)\n\nOwner of a filling\nstation\nmeans the owner, lessee or operator of a filling\nstation. (l) Highway.
