  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 34.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Consolidated Local Street and Highway Improvement (CHIPS)\n\nProgram was legislated in 1981 to provide State aid for the construction, operation, and/or maintenance of highways, bridges, and highway-railroad\ncrossings that are not on the State highway system. Between 1982 and 1991, all\nCHIPS funds were distributed to localities in a lump sum on a quarterly\nallocation basis. In 1991, as a result of statutory changes, the CHIPS Program\nwas divided into two components: a quarterly operation and maintenance\n(O&M) component, funded from the State's general fund, and a quarterly\ncapital component, funded from New York State Thruway Authority bond proceeds. Effective April 1, 2014, CHIPS is being funded in the first instance by a\nbudget appropriation and all CHIPS capital reimbursements are now issued by the\n\nOffice of the State Comptroller. CHIPS O&M funding has not been included\nsince the SFY 01-02 State budget. The Legislature converted these funds into\nadditional CHIPS capital funds that have been appropriated since SFY 02-03. Section\n10-c\nof the\n\nHighway Law and Thruway Authority bond documents require that municipalities\nprovide several certifications to the Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), that are described in section\n34.2\nof this Part. The Office of the State Comptroller (OSC) audits municipal\nrecords and accounts. Such audits may include examination of the data generated\nand used in CHIPS calculations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n34.1\n\nAmended, New\n\nYork State Register January 28, 2015/Volume XXXVII, Issue 04, eff. 1/28/2015\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
