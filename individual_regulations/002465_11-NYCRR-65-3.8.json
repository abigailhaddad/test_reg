  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 65-3.8 - Payment or denial of claim (30-day rule)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nNo-fault benefits are overdue if not paid within 30 calendar days after the insurer receives proof of claim, which shall include verification of all of the relevant information requested pursuant to section\n65-3.5\nof this Subpart. In the case of an examination under oath or a medical examination, the verification is deemed to have been received by the insurer on the day the examination was performed. (2)\n\nAn insurer shall defer payment of OBEL benefits for claims submitted by or on behalf of the eligible injured person until an OBEL option has been elected in accordance with section\n65-3.7\nof this Subpart. An insurer shall pay or deny such claims under OBEL coverage within 30 calendar days of the date that an election has been made. (b) (1)\n\nAn insurer may not interrupt the payment of benefits for any element of basic or extended economic loss pending the administering of a medical examination, unless the applicant or the applicant's attorney is responsible for the delay or inability to schedule the examination, in which case any denial of payment shall be made only in accordance with policy provisions on a prescribed denial of claim form (NYS form NF-10). (2)\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subdivision, if the insurer has information which clearly demonstrates that the applicant is no longer disabled, the insurer may discontinue the payment of benefits by forwarding to the applicant a prescribed denial of claim form. (3)\n\nExcept as provided in subdivision (e) of this section, an insurer shall not issue a denial of claim form (NYS form NF-10) prior to its receipt of verification of all of the relevant information requested pursuant to sections 65-3.5 and\n65-3.6\nof this Subpart (e.g., medical reports, wage verification, etc.). However, an insurer may issue a denial if, more than 120 calendar days after the initial request for verification, the applicant has not submitted all such verification under the applicant's control or possession or written proof providing reasonable justification for the failure to comply, provided that the verification request so advised the applicant as required in section\n65-3.5\n(o) of this Subpart. This subdivision shall not apply to a prescribed form (NF-form) as set forth in Appendix 13 of this Title, medical examination request, or examination under oath request. This paragraph shall apply, with respect to claims for medical services, to any treatment or service rendered on or after April 1, 2013, and with respect to claims for lost earnings and reasonable and necessary expenses, to any accident occurring on or after April 1, 2013. (4)\n\nIf the specific reason for a denial of a no-fault claim, or any element thereof, is a medical examination or peer review report requested by the insurer, the insurer shall release a copy of that report to the applicant for benefits, the applicant's attorney, or the applicant's treating physician, upon the written request of any of these parties. (c) Within 30 calendar days after proof of claim is received, the insurer shall either pay or deny the claim in whole or in part. (1)\n\nIf the insurer denies a claim in whole or in part involving elements of basic economic loss or extended economic loss, the insurer shall notify the applicant or the authorized representative on the prescribed denial of claim form, in duplicate, and shall furnish, if requested by the applicant, one copy of all prescribed claim forms submitted by or on behalf of the applicant thereto. However, where a denial involves a portion of a health provider's bill, the insurer may make such a denial on a form or letter approved by the department which is issued in duplicate. No form or letter shall be approved unless it contains substantially the same information as the prescribed form which is relevant to the claim denied. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subdivision, where there is a denial in part of a medical bill as a result of charges not conforming to section\n5108\nof the Insurance Law, an insurer may effect compliance with paragraph (1) of this subdivision for those overcharges of $50 or less by telephone agreement with the provider or provider's representative, with proper documentation of such agreement in the claim file. The provider must have been entitled to direct payment pursuant to section\n65-3.11\nof this Subpart. (d) Where an insurer denies part of a claim, it shall pay benefits for the undisputed elements of the claim. Such payments shall be made without prejudice to either party. (e) If an insurer has determined that benefits are not payable for any of the following reasons: (1)\nno coverage on the date of accident; (2)\ncircumstances of the accident not covered by no-fault; or\n(3)\nstatutory exclusions pursuant to section\n5103 (b)\nof the Insurance Law; it shall notify the applicant within 10 business days after such determination on a prescribed denial of claim form, specifying the reasons for the denial. Failure by an insurer to notify the applicant of its denial of the claim within the 10-business-day period after its determination shall not preclude the insurer from asserting a defense to the claim which is based upon the reasons for such denial. (f) An insurer shall be entitled to receive proper proof of claim and a failure to observe any of the time frames specified in this section shall not prevent an insurer from requiring proper proof of claim. (g) (1)\n\nProof of the fact and amount of loss sustained pursuant to Insurance Law section 5106(a) shall not be deemed supplied by an applicant to an insurer and no payment shall be due for such claimed medical services under any circumstances: (i) when the claimed medical services were not provided to an injured party; or\n(ii)\nfor those claimed medical service fees that exceed the charges permissible pursuant to Insurance Law section 5108(a) and (b) and the regulations promulgated thereunder for services rendered by medical providers. (2)\n\nThis subdivision shall apply to medical services rendered on or after April 1, 2013. (h) With respect to a denial of claim (NYS form NF-10), an insurer's non-substantive technical or immaterial defect or omission shall not affect the validity of a denial of claim. This subdivision shall apply to medical services rendered, and to lost earnings and other reasonable and necessary expenses incurred, on or after April 1, 2013. (i) Notwithstanding subdivision (e) of this section, if an insurer has reason to believe that the applicant was operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated or impaired by the use of a drug, and such intoxication or impairment was a contributing cause of the automobile accident, the insurer shall be entitled to all available information relating to the applicant's condition at the time of the accident. Proof of a claim shall not be complete until the information which has been requested, pursuant to section\n65-3.5\n(a) or (b)\nof this Subpart, has been furnished to the insurer by the applicant or the authorized representative. (j) Where the insurer has determined that a self-employed applicant's disability arose from the claimed accident, the insurer shall be deemed to have proof of claim for loss of earnings or substitute services, subject to receipt of medical proof of disability for the period claimed, when it has received a completed prescribed verification of self-employment income form (NYS form NF-7) and the proof requested thereon. The insurer shall determine therefrom the amount of loss of earnings benefits, if any, due the applicant. Notwithstanding the above, if an insurer requires verification in addition to the proof supplied, it may request such additional verification pursuant to section 65- 3.5(b) of this Subpart. (k) A death benefit claim will be deemed to have been proven when the insurer receives a copy of the decedent's death certificate and proof that the personal representative of the decedent's estate was duly appointed in this State or any other jurisdiction. (l) For the purposes of counting the 30 calendar days after proof of claim, wherein the claim becomes overdue pursuant to section\n5106\nof the Insurance Law, with the exception of section\n65-3.6\nof this Subpart, any deviation from the rules set out in this section shall reduce the 30 calendar days allowed. Example:Where an insurer sends an application for motor vehicle no-fault benefits 15 business days after notice is received at the address of the insurer's proper claim processing office instead of five business days, the 30 calendar days permitted by subdivision (a) of this section are reduced to 20 calendar days.
