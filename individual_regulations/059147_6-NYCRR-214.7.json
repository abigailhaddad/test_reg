  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 214.7 - Oven doors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Door leakage. No more than 10 percent of all coke oven doors on a single battery including\npusher side, coke side and chuck doors may emit visible emissions as measured\nin accordance with the procedure set forth in subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (b) For the purpose of\ndetermining compliance with subdivision (a) of this section, visible emissions\nare those emissions of any degree of opacity greater than zero, observed to be\nemanating from the oven doors of a battery. An inspection of the coke oven\ndoors will consist of an observer or observers walking the length of a coke\nbattery at a steady pace from a ground level position (25 to 100 feet from the\nbattery). Each door (coke side, push side and chuck doors) is to be observed\nduring the inspection for only that period of time necessary to determine\nwhether or not there is a visible emission coming from the door. The observer\nwill then shift his attention to the adjacent door, if possible, and check for\nemissions in the same manner. If a temporary machine obstruction occurs, blocking the view of one or more ovens, those oven(s) will be bypassed and the\nremaining doors on that side of the battery will be inspected. After the\ntraverse on that side of the battery, the bypassed ovens and only those ovens\nwill be reinspected. Compliance will not be determined if it is not possible to\nreinspect the blocked ovens. Where the inspector has reason to believe that\nemissions emanate from a leaking chuck door within a leaking oven door, the\nemissions will be counted as two leaks. The percentage of leaking doors will be\ncalculated by the following equation: Percentage of Leaking Doors =(A/B x C)\nA =100 x (number of leaking doors)\nB =number of doors/oven\nC =number of inservice ovens/battery\n\nThe number of doors/oven is normally three--pusher side, coke side and chuck. Compliance is determined for all doors in aggregate, not\nfor each separate door type. (c) Oven door maintenance. Any person\noperating a by-product coke oven battery must implement the following work\npractices: (1)\n\nSelf-sealing coke oven doors. (i) Each oven door will be inspected for\nvisible emissions within one hour after the charge. A record will be made of\nany door leaking one hour after the charge. (ii)\n\nDoors leaking one hour after the charge\nwill be adjusted prior to the end of the second hour after the\ncharge. (iii)\n\nEach oven door\nleaking one hour after the charge will be reinspected for visible emissions two\nhours after the charge. A record will be made of any door leaking two hours\nafter the charge. (iv)\n\nAny door\nleaking two hours after each of two successive charges must be replaced with a\nrepaired or rebuilt door prior to the next charge to that oven. (v) An adequate supply of repaired and\nrebuilt doors will be maintained on site to allow the frequency of replacement\nnecessary to comply with this section. (vi)\n\nIf a newly installed, rebuilt or\nrepaired door leaks more than two hours after the charge, the door and jamb\nmust be inspected when the door is next removed from the oven. If the door is\nfound to be defective, it must be replaced with a repaired or rebuilt door to\nthat oven as soon as it is reasonably possible, normally within two charges to\nthat oven. If the door is not found to be defective, the jamb must be replaced\nas soon as it is reasonably possible. (2)\n\nLuted doors. (i) Luted doors leaking 15 minutes after the\ncharge must be immediately reluted. (ii)\n\nDoors that fail to seal after the first\nreluting must be recorded. (iii)\n\nLeaks appearing after the first reluting must be reluted immediately. (3)\n\nChuck doors. (i) Chuck doors must be inspected within one\nhour after the charge. A record must be made of any chuck door leaking one hour\nafter the charge. (ii)\n\nChuck doors\nleaking one hour after the charge must be gasketed or luted, prior to the next\ncharge to that oven. (iii)\n\nIf a\nfreshly gasketed door is leaking one hour after the charge, the gasket or the\noven door shall be replaced prior to the next charge to that oven. (iv)\n\nIf a luted chuck door is leaking one\nhour after the charge, it must be reluted. (4)\n\nAll doors and jambs will be cleaned\ncompletely prior to each charge. (5)\n\nRecords of inspections required by this\nsection, including the names of inspectors, the date and time of each door\ninspection and ovens observed leaking must be maintained. (6)\n\nWork practices other than the above may\nbe substituted after approval by the commissioner. (d) Work practice and maintenance plan. Any\nperson who owns a by-product coke oven battery must submit a proposed work\npractice and maintenance plan to the office which issued the certificate to\noperate for that source. The work practice and maintenance plan must be\napproved before the by-product coke battery may be operated. The plan must\ninclude: (1)\nthe name and title of the person\nresponsible for oven door maintenance; (2)\nthe procedures to be followed to assure\ncompliance with subdivision (c) of this section; (3)\nthe number of replacement doors and jambs\nkept on site for each battery; and\n(4)\nthe coal charging procedures.
