  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 2500.1 - Authority, purpose and policy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The State Environmental Quality Review\n\nAct (SEQR) of 1975, article 8 of Environmental Conservation Law provides that\nall agencies shall prepare, or cause to be prepared by contract or otherwise an\nenvironmental impact statement on any action they propose or approve which may\nhave a significant effect on the environment. Section 8-0113, subdivisions (1)\nand (2) require that after consultation with other agencies subject to the\nprovisions of article 8, including State agencies and representatives of local\ngovernments and after conducting public hearings and review of any other\ncomments submitted, the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation shall adopt\nrules and regulations of Statewide applicability that implement the provisions\nof SEQR. (b) Rules and regulations\nof Statewide applicability were adopted by the Commissioner of Environmental\n\nConservation as Part 617 of Title 6 of the Official Compilation of Codes, Rules\nand Regulations of the State of New York on March 19, 1976. (c) This Part is adopted by the Jones Beach\n\nState Parkway Authority pursuant to subdivision (3) of section 8-0113 of\narticle 8 of Environmental Conservation Law which requires agencies to adopt\nand publish such additional procedures as may be necessary for the\nimplementation by them of SEQR, consistent with the Statewide rules and\nregulations (6 NYCRR Part\n617\n) adopted by the Commissioner of Environmental\n\nConservation pursuant to subdivision (1) of section 8-0113 of article 8 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law. (d) Section 617.0 (6 NYCRR\n617.0\n) sets out the procedure for agency rule making as\nfollows: Section \"617.0 Agency rule making. (a) All agencies shall, consistent with the\nprovisions of article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law, after public\nhearing, adopt and publish such additional procedures as may be necessary for\nthe implementation by them of this Part. This may be accomplished by the use of\nuniform procedures, or adoption by reference of procedures applicable to other\nagencies. (b) Individual agencies\nare encouraged to develop their own criteria consistent with section 617.9 of\nthis Part and their own classification system whether or not in the form of\nsection 617.12 of this Part to cover the particular actions engaged in, or\nreviewed by them. Such criteria and classification systems shall be no less\nprotective of environmental values than this Part. Individual agencies are also\nencouraged to develop a classification of actions which are ministerial actions\nand criteria for determining when actions are or are not ministerial. (c) The procedures prescribed under this Part\nshall, to the greatest extent practicable, be incorporated in and integrated\nwith existing agency procedures and variance in form alone shall constitute no\nobjection thereto. Such individual agency procedures, however, shall be no less\nprotective of environmental values, public participation, and agency and\njudicial review than the procedures set forth in this Part. (d) Upon written request of any person, the\ncommissioner (of DEC) shall review and determine whether any action contained\nin an agency's own list or classification system similar to section 617.12 is\nconsistent with the criteria of 617.9 and the actions listed in section 617.12\nof this Part. The commissioner (of DEC) shall give written notification of the\ndetermination to such persons and the agency within 30 days of the receipt of a\nrequest. (e) Such agency procedures\nshall provide for interagency working relationships in cases where actions\ntypically involve more than one agency, liaison with the public, public notice\nrequirements, provisions for public comment, and such other procedures as may\nbe required to effect the efficient and expeditious administration of this\n\nPart. Procedures for administrative review of agency decisions may also be\nincorporated in agency rules. (f) All agencies shall review their present statutory authority, administrative\nregulations and current policies and procedures for the purpose of determining\nwhether there are any deficiencies or inconsistencies therein which prohibit or\nimpeded full compliance with this Part. Agencies should examine time limits or\nschedule for actions, hearing procedures, public notice provisions, standards\nfor agency action which limit or exclude environmental factors, provisions for\nenvironmental data gathering, provisions for public participation in the\ndecision makng process, and procedures and methods of reviewing environmental\nimpact. By January 1, 1977, agencies shall recommend or effect such measures as\nmay be necessary to bring their authority and policies into conformity with\nthis Part, including statutory changes, amendments to administrative\nregulations, new standard forms, revised instructions and procedural guidelines\nand improved personnel training. (g) Each agency shall maintain a file open to\npublic inspection containing a list of all environmental impact statements\nprepared or under preparation by or at the request of such agency.\"\n(e) As suggested in 6 NYCRR\n617.10\n(a), quoted in subdivision (d) of this section the Jones Beach State\n\nParkway Authority has used 6 NYCRR Part\n618\nas a model for this\n\nPart.
