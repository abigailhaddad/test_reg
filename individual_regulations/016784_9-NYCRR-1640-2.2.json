  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-2.2 - Other funds\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe statutory requirement for the segregation of State\nmoneys from Federal financial aid or assistance has been extended, by\nregulation of the commissioner and the terms of the various contracts for State\naid, to require the segregation, both by project and by purpose, of all funds\nreceived or held by local agencies in connection with State-aided projects. The\nsegregation, by project and by purpose, reflects the fact that funds advanced\nor to be advanced by the State, in the form of loans or subsidies, are\nearmarked for specific purposes and may not be used for other purposes. Such\nuse would represent a mingling of funds, actual or constructive. This means, for example, that funds for the development or operation of a State-aided\nproject must be set aside from all other funds and may not be used to pay\ndevelopment costs or operating expenses of another project. Similarly, with\nrespect to a given State-aided project, funds representing revenues (rents and\nsubsidies) of the project during the operating period must be segregated from\nfunds received for the development of the project and may not be used to pay\ndevelopment costs, etc. The commissioner may, however, waive these\nrequirements, and permit the mingling of funds (other than Federal funds) under\ncertain circumstances. No mingling of funds, under any circumstances, shall, however, take place without the prior approval and authorization of the\ncommissioner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1640-2.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
