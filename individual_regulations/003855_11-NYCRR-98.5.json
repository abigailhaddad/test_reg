  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 98.5 - Contract segmentation method\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Contract segmentation method means the method of dividing the period from issue to the mandatory expiry date of a policy into successive segments, with the length of each segment being the period from the end of the prior segment (from policy inception, for the first segment) to the end of the appropriate policy year determined in accordance with subdivision (b) of this section. (b) The length of a particular contract segment shall be set equal to the minimum of the value of t for which G\nt\nis greater than R\nt\n(if G\nt\nnever exceeds R\nt\nsuch segment length is deemed to be the number of years from the beginning of the segment to the mandatory expiry date of the policy), where G\nt\nand R\nt\nare defined in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision. If GP\nx+k+t\nis greater than zero and GP\nx+k+t-1\nis equal to zero, G\nt\nshall be deemed to be 1000. If GP\nx+k+t\nand GP\nx+k+t-1\nare both equal to zero, G\nt\nshall be deemed to be zero. 1\nG\nt\n= (GP\nx + k + t\n/GP\nx + k + t - 1\n)\nwhere: (i) x = original issue age; (ii)\nk = the number of years from the date of issue to the beginning of the particular segment; and\n(iii)\nt = 1, 2,..., t is reset to 1 at the beginning of each segment; and\n(iv)\nGP\nx + k + t- 1\n= the gross premium per thousand of face amount, ignoring policy fees, if such policy fees are a level dollar amount for the entire premium paying period of the policy, for year t of the segment. 2\nR\nt\n= (q\nx + k + t\n/q\nx + k + t - 1\n), but not less than one\nwhere: (i) x, k, and t are defined in paragraph (1) of this subdivision; (ii)\nq\nx + k + t\n= the valuation mortality rate for deficiency reserves for policy year k + t + 1, but setting X equal to 1 for this purpose if the mortality of standard of section\n98.4\n(b)(5)\nof this Part is elected, except as noted in the next sentence. Where a segment break occurs such that t is the length of the segment and a different valuation mortality table will be used in the next segment (e.g., the table will change from the special optional mortality factors of section\n98.4\n[a][3]\nof this Part to the 1980 CSO table without 10-year select mortality factors), then q\nx + k + t\nis based on the valuation mortality table used in the current segment; (iii)\nq\nx + k + t -1\n= the valuation mortality rate for deficiency reserves for policy year k + t, but setting X equal to 1 for this purpose if the mortality of section\n98.4\n(b)(5)\nof this Part is elected, except as noted in the next sentence. Where a segment break has just occurred such that t = 1 and a different valuation mortality table is being used in the current segment, then q\nx + k + t - 1\nis based on the valuation mortality table in the current segment; and\n(iv)\nat the option of the insurer, R\nt\nmay be increased or decreased by one percent in any policy year, but R\nt\nshall not be less than one. (c) For policies subject to a non-elective change in valuation mortality rates because the requirements for continued use of the prior rates were no longer satisfied, the insurer may, but shall not be required to, recalculate the segments. (d) For policies subject to an insurer-election to substitute the 2001 Preferred Class Structure Mortality Table for the 2001 CSO Mortality Table: (1)\nif the policy was issued on a policy form filed for approval prior to January 1, 2009, the insurer may, but shall not be required to, recalculate the segments; and\n(2)\n\nIf the policy was issued on a policy form filed for approval on or after January 1, 2009 and prior to January 1, 2020, the insurer shall recalculate the segments using the new valuation mortality rates. (e) For policies subject to an insurer-election to substitute the 2017 CSO Preferred Class Structure Mortality Table for the 2017 CSO Mortality Table the in surer shall recalculate the segments using the new valuation mortality rates.
