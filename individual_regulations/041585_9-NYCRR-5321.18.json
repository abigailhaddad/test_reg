(f) A gaming facility seeking to\nuse a linked progressive on a table game shall submit for approval the location\nand manner of installing a progressive meter display mechanism. (g) Two or more table games within the same\ngaming facility that are linked to a common progressive meter for the purpose\nof offering a shared progressive jackpot shall: (1)\nhave the same probability of hitting the\ncombination that will award the progressive jackpot as every other table game\nlinked to the common progressive meter; and\n(2)\nrequire that the same progressive wager\namount be invested to entitle the player a chance at winning the progressive\njackpot. (h) Progressive\nwager amounts shall not be changed by a gaming facility unless such gaming\nfacility receives approval for a proposed change from the commission in\nwriting, pursuant to section\n5323.13\nof this\nsubchapter.
