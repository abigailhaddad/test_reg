  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 454.5 - Application of correction factors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If two correction factors apply to a measurement, they are applied\ncumulatively. (b) The following\nexamples illustrate the application of correction factors to sound level\nmeasurement readings: (1)\n\nExample 1--highway\noperations. Assume that a motor vehicle generates a maximum observed sound\nlevel reading of 86 dB(A) during a measurement in accordance with Part 452 of\nthis Title. Assume also that the distance between the microphone location point\nand the microphone target point is 60 feet (18.3 m), and that the measurement\narea of the test site is acoustically \"hard\". The corrected sound level\ngenerated by the motor vehicle would be 85 dB(A), calculated as follows: 86 dB(A) Uncorrected reading\n+ 1 dB(A) Distance correction factor\n- 2 dB(A) Ground surface correction factor\n________\n85 dB(A) Corrected reading\n(2)\n\nExample 2--stationary test. Assume that a\nmotor vehicle generates maximum sound level readings which average 88 dB(A)\nduring a measurement in accordance with the rules in Part 453 of this Title. Assume also that the distance between the microphone location point and the\nmicrophone target point is 35 feet (10.7 m), and that the measurement area of\nthe test site is acoustically \"soft\". The corrected sound level generated by\nthe motor vehicle would be 87 dB(A), calculated as follows: 88 dB(A) Uncorrected average of readings\n- 3 dB(A) Distance correction factor\n+ 2 d(A) Ground surface correction factor\n________\n87 dB(A) Corrected reading\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n454.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
