  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1858.1 - General rules\n\nState Regulations\n\nService of Process and Proof of\n\nService\n1. Pursuant to Uniform\n\nRule 207.7(c) all proof of service of process, notices of motion, and orders to\nshow cause, must be filed two days prior to the return date. 2. Motions are to be made returnable only\nevery other week rather than every week in which the process calendar is\ncalled. It is considered the responsibility of counsel to check with the clerk\nof the court as to the appropriate date to be entered for return of notice of\nmotion prior to serving and filing. Any motion noticed with an incorrect date\nwill be returned to counsel and not placed on the calendar until the correct\ndate is inserted on the notice of motion and reserved on all\nrespondents. 3. Where, by court\norder, service of process is permitted by certified or registered mail there is\nno need to file a signed return receipt unless directed by the court. The\naffidavit of service, however, must include a statement that the mailing was\nnot returned to the sender as undeliverable. Pleadings and Papers Filed With\n\nCourt\n4. Any pleading\nor paper supplemental thereto; e.g., waiver and consent, renunciation, affidavit etc., which is dated more than six months prior to date\nof filing, is considered stale and not accepted for filing by the\ncourt. 5. Where it appears that a\npleading must be amended, amendment may be accomplished by the affidavit of the\npetitioner or petitioner's attorney unless directed otherwise by the clerk of\nthe court. 6. No party in interest\nin a proceeding can act as notary for any papers filed in the proceeding. Status of the Parties; Proof of\n\nKinship\n7. Pursuant\nto 207.17(d) Uniform Rules the court will not accept an affidavit of kinship\nsigned by the spouse or issue of a petitioner claiming to be the sole statutory\ndistributee. 8. Pursuant to 207.50\n\nUniform Rules the court will require service of process on an alleged divorced\nspouse unless, either a certified copy of the divorce decree or other\nacceptable proof of divorce is filed with the petition. Also the court may\nrequire that where the sole statutory distributee is an alleged surviving\nspouse, a copy of the marriage certificate be filed with the petition. Trials\n9. The calendar for the trial of contested\nproceedings is called on the first Monday of every month. A note of issue and\nstatement of readiness in compliance with Uniform Rules 207.29 and statement of\nissues in compliance with Rule 207.30, must be timely served and filed 10 days\nprior to the Trial Call Calendar date requested, otherwise the proceeding will\nnot be placed on the Call Calendar. Once a day certain and time for trial is\nfixed by the Surrogate, no adjournments will be granted barring extraordinary\ncircumstances. In this respect actual engagement of counsel is considered\ninsufficient grounds for an adjournment. Prior to the date fixed for trial, all\ntrial counsel will be directed to meet with a member of the law department so\nthat exhibits to be used on trial can be marked for identification and\nwitnesses identified. Miscellaneous\n10. All\npro se\npetitioners\nfor either letters of administration or letters testamentary must be personally\ninterviewed by the Chief Clerk, Deputy Chief Clerk or a member of the law\ndepartment prior to filing their petition with the court. Probate Department\n1. The court requires the personal appearance\nand examination under oath by the clerk of any witness to a will offered for\nprobate which was executed within 90 days of the date of the decedent's death. Where all the parties in interest in the proceeding are adult and competent and\nsign an acknowledged waiver, and consent to entry of the will to probate, the\ncourt will dispense with this requirement. 2. Any probate proceeding marked for decree\nsubject to examination or subscribing witnesses requires that such examination\nbe conducted within 90 days of the return date, or else objections will be\ndeemed waived. The time for filing objections after completion of the\nexamination of subscribing witnesses may be extended by stipulation or counsel. A decision and order encompassing this directive is forwarded to counsel after\nthe return date (Exhibit A). Attorney Fiduciary\n3. (a) Where the petition for probate requests that letters testamentary issue to a\nperson who is also an attorney, not related by blood or affinity with the\ndecedent, the court requires that the attorney fiduciary submit an affidavit\nexplaining his relationship with the decedent and the circumstances surrounding\nhis nomination as executor. The attorney/fiduciary is provided with a printed\nnotice detailing the information which is to be set forth in the subject\naffidavit (Exhibit B). After the required affidavit is filed, it is submitted\nto the Surrogate, who shall determine whether a hearing is necessary on the\nissue of the attorney/fiduciary' s qualifications and the facts surrounding his\nappointment. (b) If the\nattorney/fiduciary is found to be qualified to act as executor, he or she must\ncomply with Uniform Rule 207.60. Preliminary Letters\n4. (a) Any order granting preliminary letters\nwill provide that such letters will expire 6 months after the date of issuance. The order will further provide for the petitioner to post a bond for the full\namount of the estate assets alleged in the petition for probate. (b) A petition requesting leave to extend\npreliminary letters beyond 6 months must be accompanied by a cash flow\nstatement detailing the assets marshalled and claims paid by the petitioner. Any discrepancy between the value of estate assets set forth in the cash flow\nstatement and the original petition for probate, requires the filing of an\naffidavit explaining the discrepancy. If leave for extension is granted, preliminary letters will be extended only for an additional 6 months. 5. In addition to the common\npractice of requiring an affidavit and hearing regarding any bequest in the\ndecedent's will to an attorney (\nMatter of Putnam\n), the court\nrequires the submission of an affidavit detailing the relationship of legatee\nto the testator and the facts surrounding a bequest to any person having a\nconfidential relationship with the decedent (\ne.g., clergyman, accountant, doctor, nurse, home care attendant, etc.). The required affidavit\ntogether with the petition is submitted to the Surrogate to determine whether a\nhearing on the bequest is necessary. 6. Where a cause of action for personal\ninjury or wrongful death is listed as an asset of the estate and any of the\nparties in interest in the estate, either as legatees or distributees, are\nunder a disability (infancy, incompetency, unknown, etc.) letters testamentary\nissued by the court will be restricted to provide that the cause of action\ncannot be settled or compromised without further order of the court. Administration Department\n1. If the petition for letters of\nadministration sets forth a cause of action for personal injury or wrongful\ndeath as an asset of the estate, the court follows the common practice of\nrestricting letters to provide that the administrator be prohibited from\ncompromising or collecting the proceeds from such cause of action without\nfurther order of the court (Exhibit C). In addition the court requires that the\npetitioner and the petitioner's attorney both file separate affidavits\n(Exhibits D and E) stating that they will not compromise, settle or collect any\nproceeds of the cause of action without further order of the Surrogate's\n\nCourt. 2. In order to dispense with\nthe necessity of a bond pursuant to SCPA 805, the petitioner for letters of\nadministration must not only submit the unanimous acknowledged consent of all\ndistributees but also a copy of a paid funeral bill. 3. Absent a showing of special circumstances, the court will not entertain a petition for letters of administration where the\nsole asset of the estate is title to real property which in theory passes by\noperation of law without the necessity of letters of administration. Small Estate\n\nAdministration\n4. In\na proceeding under article 13 of SCPA, the court may require submission of a\nthird party affidavit of kinship if it is alleged that the petitioner is the\nsole distributee of the decedent. 5. The certificate of letters of voluntary\nadministrator, issued pursuant to article 13 SCPA, will specifically identify\nthe alleged assets of an estate on its face, e.g., bank name\naccount number and limit the right of the voluntary administrator to marshall\nonly such identified assets. Accounting Department\n1. The court requires that a copy of the\naccount be served with the citation on all parties in interest in the account. Proof of service must reflect such receipt, as must any waiver and consent\nsigned by a party in interest. Expenses for photocopies and mailings of the\naccount and citation shall be allowed as a legal disbursement. 2. In order for an accounting to be accepted\nfor filing by the court, the petition must state whether or not an inventory of\nassets pursuant to 207.20 Uniform Rules has been filed with the\ncourt. 3. In any estate with gross\ntaxable assets in excess of $108,000.00, the petitioner may either cite the\n\nState Tax Commission as a party in interest or submit proof of fixation and\npayment of tax prior to the entry of a final decree. 4. Where it appears from the papers on file\nthat either attorney's fees or fiduciary commissions have been improperly taken\nin advance of an accounting, e.g., restricted or limited\nletters, the petition must request that such advance payment be approved by the\ncourt\nnunc pro tunc. 5. The court will not permit general language\napproving the account in a waiver and consent signed by a party in interest. A\nwaiver and consent by a residuary legatee or distributee is not acceptable\nunless it specifically consents to every prayer for relief set forth in the\npetition and citation. All other interested parties need only specifically\nconsent to relief which effects their interest. 6. Where real property is sold by a\nfiduciary, only the sum equal to the net proceeds of sale is to be included in\n\nSchedule A of the account and a copy of the closing statement is to be\nsubmitted with the account. All expenses incurred in connection with the sale, e.g., RPT tax; broker's commissions; attorney's fee, etc., and\nthe satisfaction of outstanding liens\ne.g., mortgage; Parking\n\nViolation Bureau judgment, etc., must be deducted from gross sale price prior\nto entry in Schedule A. Miscellaneous Department\n1. A petition for permission to sell real\nproperty pursuant to article 19 of SCPA must be accompanied by a copy of the\ncontract of sale and a current appraisal of the subject property. Inventory of Assets (Rule\n207.20[d])\n2. (a) A notice of the requirements of Uniform\n\nRule 207.20 is sent with original certificates of letters testamentary or\nadministration (Exhibit F). In general this rule requires the filing of an\ninventory of the assets which constitute the gross taxable estate within 6\nmonths after the issuance of letters. (b) If the required inventory is not filed 90\ndays after the date due, letters may be suspended and will not be reinstated\nuntil the requirements of 207.20 are complied with. 3. A petition to fix and determine attorney's\nfees pursuant to SCPA 2110, must allege the specific dollar amount of the fee\nrequested and must be accompanied by an affidavit of legal services. Compromise and Account\n4. (a) The\ncourt requires that jurisdiction over either the defendant or the defendant's\ninsurance carrier be obtained in any proceeding to compromise a cause of action\nfor personal injury or wrongful death. This requirement is satisfied by either: (1)\na letter on insurance company letterhead\nadvising of the settlement of a cause of action for a specific dollar sum in\nbehalf of their insured defendant; (2)\nan original signed stipulation of\nsettlement or court certified copy of stipulation placed on the\nrecord; (3)\na waiver and consent\nsigned and acknowledged by an insurance company officer who has the authority\nto execute; (4)\nservice of citation\non either the insurance carrier or the named defendant in the negligence\naction. (b) A statement\nof whether or not all funeral and medical expenses have been paid must be set\nforth in the petition. (c) A copy\nof the attorney's retainer agreement must be filed with the petition, regardless of whether the parties in interest are competent adults and have\nconsented to the fee requested. (d) Regardless of whether the petition requests that settlement proceeds be\nallocated to wrongful death (which are nontaxable) or personal injury (which\nare taxable as estate assets), the court may require that the NYS Tax\n\nDepartment be cited for any settlement in excess of $108,000.00 and the U.S. Internal Revenue Department be served for any settlement in excess of\n$600,000.00. (e) The waiver and\nconsent of any beneficiary or other interested party in the proceeding must\ncomply in form and content with rule 5 of the accounting department. (f) A formal judicial account must be filed\nalong with the petition for leave to compromise where: (1)\neither any party in interest is under a\ndisability\ne.g., infancy, incompetency; (2)\nthere are disputed creditor's claims\nor; (3)\nthere are estate assets\nother than settlement proceeds; or\n(4)\nthe petitioner seeks to compromise both a\ncause of action for personal injury and wrongful death.
