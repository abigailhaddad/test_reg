When the horse is part of an entry or the field, all betting upon such entry or field shall cease and all money wagered upon\nsuch entry or field shall be refunded. Notwithstanding the termination of such\nbetting, the horse or horses in such coupled entry or field that have not been\nscratched shall start in the race as nonbetting interests for the purse and the\nfinish of such horses in the race shall be disregarded for pari-mutuel\npurposes. The circumstances shall be announced over the public address system\nat the time such action is taken and thereafter as may be necessary to inform\nthe public adequately.
