  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 174.2 - Filing quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting returns\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 674(a)(4)\n(a) Who must file. (1)\n\nGeneral. (i) Wage payments. Every employer maintaining\nan office or transacting business within New York State and making payment of\nany wages taxable under article 22 of the Tax Law to a resident or a\nnonresident individual, whether or not such wages are sufficient to require the\nwithholding of New York State personal income tax, and every employer required\nto file a wage reporting return pursuant to section\n171-a\nof the Tax Law with respect to gross\nwages paid to at least one employee performing employment, whether or not such\nemployee is a resident of New York State for purposes of the Tax Law and\nwhether or not such wages are subject to withholding of New York State personal\nincome tax or payment of New York State personal income tax under article 22 of\nthe Tax Law, must file quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting\nreturns in accordance with the provisions of this section. (\nNote: See Part 2380 of this Title for requirements relating\nto the filing of wage reports.)\n(ii)\n\nPension payments. Every payer of\npensions, annuities, retired pay or IRA payments which are subject to New York\n\nState withholding shall be required to file quarterly combined withholding and\nwage reporting returns. (\nNote: Each such payer need not file\nthe wage reporting portion of Part B of such returns, as described in\nsubdivision [b] of this section, since the payments described in this\nsubparagraph are not gross wages within the meaning of section\n2380.4\nof this Title.)\n(iii)\n\nGambling\nwinnings. Every payer of gambling winnings from which New York State personal\nincome tax was withheld shall be required to file quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting returns which shall be separate from such\nreturns which include wage and/or annuity payments. (\nNote: Each such payer need not file the wage reporting portion of Part B of such\nreturns, as described in subdivision [b] of this section, since gambling\nwinnings are not gross wages within the meaning of section\n2380.4\nof this Title.)\n(iv)\n\nThe quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return referred to in this section\nreplaces form WRS-2, Employer's Quarterly Report of Wages Paid to Each\n\nEmployee, and the New York State copy of forms IT-2102, Wage\nand Tax Statement, IT-2102P, Statement for Recipients of\n\nAnnuities, Pensions, Retired Pay or IRA Payments, and IT-2102G, Report of Certain Gambling Winnings. (2)\n\nSeasonal employers. (i) General rule. An employer need not file\neither Part A or Part B of the quarterly combined withholding and wage\nreporting return for a calendar quarter (see subdivision [b] of this section)\nif such employer, due to the seasonal nature of its business: (a) does not, during the calendar quarter, make payment of wages which are subject to New York State income tax\nwithholding; and\n(b) has not, during the calendar quarter, paid wages subject to unemployment insurance\ncontributions, pursuant to article 18 of the Labor Law. (ii)\n\nSpecial rule. Notwithstanding the\nprovisions of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, an employer described in such\nsubparagraph must, on or before the due date prescribed by subdivision (c) of\nthis section for filing the quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting\nreturn covering the last calendar quarter of the year, file the annual employee\nspecific withholding reconciliation portion of Part B of such return. If such\nemployer discontinues business or permanently ceases to pay wages during the\ncalendar year, the annual employee specific withholding reconciliation\ninformation must be furnished on such employer's final quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return on or before the due date prescribed by\nsubdivision (f) of this section. (3)\n\nDefinitions. (i) For purposes of this section: (a) when the context indicates that the\nsubject matter being referred to relates to the requirements for withholding\n\nNew York State personal income tax, the terms \"employer,\" \"employee\" and\n\"wages\" shall have the meanings prescribed by Part 171 of this Title; and\n(b) when the context indicates\nthat the subject matter being referred to relates to wage reporting, the terms\n\"employer,\" \"employment\" and \"gross wages\" shall have the meanings prescribed\nby Part 2380 of this Title. (ii)\n\nExcept where otherwise specifically\nprovided for, any reference in this section to \"employer\" shall be deemed to\ninclude reference to \"payer\" or where applicable, the New York State Division\nof the Lottery and any reference in this section to \"employee\" shall be deemed\nto include reference to \"payee.\"\n(b) Contents of quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting returns. (1)\n\nGeneral. Each quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting\nreturn shall consist of two parts: Part A, which shall detail the withholding\ntax transactions for the calendar quarter for which such quarterly combined\nreturn is being filed, and such other related information as may be required by\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance in forms and instructions, and Part B, which shall detail employee name, employee identification number and gross\nwages paid for wage reporting purposes for the calendar quarter for which such\nquarterly combined return is being filed, and employee name, employee\nidentification number and annual employee withholding reconciliation\ninformation for the calendar year, or a portion of such year if the employer\nceased paying wages prior to the end of such calendar year, if applicable, and\nsuch other related information as may be required by the Department of Taxation\nand Finance in forms and instructions. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, a quarterly combined withholding and wage\nreporting EZ return (consisting of form WT-4AEZ and Part B) shall be filed\nwhere an employer has been required to deduct and withhold, but has not paid\nover to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, a cumulative\naggregate amount of less than $700 of tax during a calendar quarter (see\nsection\n674[a][2] of the Tax Law\nand section\n174.1\n[b][2]\nof this Part). (3)\n\nThe provisions\nof this subdivision and subdivision (a) of this section can be illustrated by\nthe following examples: Example 1: During each calendar quarter of a calendar year, employer\nA employed the same 10 employees, all of whom are New York State residents for\npurposes of the Tax Law. All employees performed employment for A during each\nsuch calendar quarter. A was required to deduct, withhold and pay over New York\n\nState income tax during each calendar quarter for all of A's employees. A was\nalso liable for unemployment insurance contributions pursuant to article 18 of\nthe Labor Law during each such calendar quarter. A would be required to file a\nquarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return covering each calendar\nquarter consisting of Part A, the wage reporting portion of Part B (reporting\ngross wages paid to all 10 employees), and for the quarterly return covering\nthe last calendar quarter of the year, the employee specific annual withholding\nreconciliation portion of Part B (reporting such withholding reconciliation\ninformation for all 10 employees). (\nNote: If the conditions\ndescribed in paragraph [2] of this subdivision are met, then A must file A's\nquarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return using form WT-4AEZ and\n\nPart B for the calendar quarter or quarters in which such conditions are\nmet.)\n\nExample 2: B employs a maid and a cook in B's home during each\ncalendar quarter of a calendar year. The maid and the cook receive combined\nwages totaling $450 in each calendar quarter. The wages of the maid and the\ncook are excluded from withholding for Federal income tax withholding purposes\nand there is no such Federal withholding. B is not liable for unemployment\ninsurance contributions pursuant to article 18 of the Labor Law and is\ntherefore not required to file the wage reporting portion of Part B of the\nquarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return for each calendar\nquarter of the calendar year. Since the wages of the maid and the cook are not\nsubject to Federal income tax withholding, they are similarly not wages for New\n\nYork State personal income tax withholding purposes pursuant to Part 171 of\nthis Article, and there is in fact no such New York State personal income tax\nwithholding. Therefore, B need not file Part A of the quarterly combined return\nfor each calendar quarter, and also need not file the annual employee specific\nwithholding reconciliation portion of Part B included in the last quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return for the calendar year. Example 3: Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except that the\nmaid, in each calendar quarter, elects to have New York State income tax\nwithheld. Therefore, B still need not file the wage reporting portion of Part B\nof the quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return for each\ncalendar quarter of the calendar year. However, since the wages paid to the\nmaid are subject to New York State personal income tax withholding in each\ncalendar quarter, B must, in each such quarter, file Part A of the quarterly\ncombined return, and on the return covering the last calendar quarter of the\ncalendar year, include the maid only in the annual employee specific\nwithholding reconciliation portion of Part B. Example 4: During each calendar quarter of a calendar year, Employer\nC makes annuity payments to 50 payees, all of whom are New York State residents\nfor purposes of the Tax Law. Such benefits are retirement benefits. Pursuant to\n\nTax Law, section 671(b) and section\n171.10\nof this Article, 40 of such payees do not elect to have New York State personal\nincome tax withheld from such annuity payments in each calendar quarter, leaving 10 of such payees who made the election and are, therefore, subject to\n\nNew York State withholding. For wage reporting purposes, C is not required to\nfile the wage reporting portion of Part B of the quarterly combined withholding\nand wage reporting return in each calendar quarter since all of the annuity\npayments do not qualify as \"gross wages\" within the meaning of section\n2380.4\nof this Title. C must complete Part A of the quarterly combined return in each\ncalendar quarter, and must include information relating to only the 10 payees\nwho opted for New York State personal income tax withholding in the annual\nemployee specific withholding reconciliation portion of Part B of the quarterly\ncombined return covering the last calendar quarter of the calendar year. Example 5: D pays gambling winnings subject to New York State\npersonal income tax withholding in each calendar quarter of a calendar year\n(see section\n171.11\nof this Article). Such gambling winnings are not \"gross wages\" for wage\nreporting purposes pursuant to section\n2380.4\nof this Title. Thus, D need not complete the wage reporting portion of Part B\nof the quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return in each\ncalendar quarter of the calendar year. However, D will be required to file Part\nA of the quarterly combined return in each calendar quarter and to complete the\nannual employee specific withholding reconciliation portion of Part B of the\nquarterly combined return covering the last calendar quarter of the calendar\nyear. (c) Due dates for filing quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting\nreturns. The quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting\nreturns referred to in this section shall be filed no later than the last day\nof the month following the last day of each calendar quarter, except that the\nquarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return covering the last\ncalendar quarter of each year shall be filed no later than February 28th of the\nsucceeding year. (d) Quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return of a governmental\nemployer. The quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting\nreturn of a governmental employer is to be made by the officer or employee\ncontrolling the payment of wages or other officer or employee appropriately\ndesignated for that purpose. (e) Transmittal of quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return. Both Parts A and B of the quarterly combined withholding\nand wage reporting return referred to in this section must be filed together\nand sent to the New York State Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. (f) Final\nquarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return. The last quarterly combined withholding and wage\nreporting return (Part A and Part B) for any employer who discontinues business\nor permanently ceases to pay wages subject to New York State personal income\ntax withholding and gross wages to persons in employment for purposes of wage\nreporting requirements must be marked \"Final Return\" and the date of the last\npayroll must be furnished by the employer. Such final quarterly combined return\nmust be filed within 30 days of the date of the employer's last payroll and be\naccompanied by the remittance of the cumulative aggregate amount of tax\nrequired to be deducted and withheld, if any. (g) Required or elective use of\nmagnetic media for filing quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting\nreturn. (1)\n\nDefinitions. For purposes of this subdivision: (i) the term\ncommissioner\nmeans the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance or his delegates; (ii)\nthe term\ndepartment\nmeans the Department of Taxation and Finance; (iii)\nthe term\nmachine-readable paper\nform\nmeans any machine-readable paper form, including optical scan\npaper form, as described by the department in instructions for use in complying\nwith the requirements of this subdivision; (iv)\nthe term\nmagnetic media\nmeans media, including magnetic tape, diskette, cassette and mini-disk, as\ndescribed by the department in instructions for use in complying with the\nrequirements of this subdivision; and\n(v) the term\nperson\nmeans\nany individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, corporation, governmental entity, or any other entity required to file a quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return. (2)\n\nMagnetic media filing. (i) General rules. (a) Any person required to include\ninformation relating to 250 or more individuals on Part B of the quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return during each of the four calendar\nquarters preceding the current calendar quarter shall be required to commence\nfiling Part B of such quarterly combined return using magnetic media. (b) The department shall, each calendar\nquarter, provide written notification to all persons first meeting the\nprovisions of clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph. Each such\nperson shall, at such time and in accordance with instructions contained in\nsuch notice, submit a test magnetic media tape or disk to the department which\nreflects the magnetic media specifications and format for filing Part B of such\nquarterly combined return. Upon successful test completion, the department\nshall provide certification to such person, and shall also inform such person\nof the first calendar quarter for which Part B of the quarterly combined return\nshall be filed using magnetic media. (c) If, in accordance with this subparagraph, a person is required to file Part B of the quarterly combined withholding and\nwage reporting return with the department using magnetic media, then such\nperson shall continue filing Part B of such quarterly combined return using\nmagnetic media in subsequent calendar quarters, regardless of whether or not\nsuch person meets the 250 individual threshold prescribed in clause\n(\na\n) of this subparagraph. However, if such person notifies the\ndepartment in writing no later than 30 days after the start of a calendar\nquarter that such 250 individual threshold will not be met in such calendar\nquarter and that such person no longer wishes to file using magnetic media, then such person shall cease filing using such media. (ii)\n\nAggregation. An individual for whom wage\nreporting and annual withholding information is shown on Part B of the\nquarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return shall be counted once\nin determining whether the threshold prescribed by clause (\na\n)\nof subparagraph (i) of this paragraph has been met. (iii)\n\nExamples. The provisions of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph can be illustrated by the following examples: Example 1: A employs the same 240 individuals during each calendar\nquarter of a calendar year. A is required to provide wage reporting information\nfor all 240 individuals during each calendar quarter of the year. A must also\nprovide annual employee specific withholding reconciliation information for all\n240 individuals during the last calendar quarter of the year. A has not\nexceeded the 250 individual threshold referred to in clause\n(\na\n) of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph during such last\ncalendar quarter. Example 2: B receives written notice from the department during a\ncalendar quarter that B exceeded the 250 individual threshold referred to in\nclause (i)(\na\n) of this paragraph during each of the preceding\nfour calendar quarters. B, in accordance with instructions contained in such\nnotice, files a test tape with the department using the prescribed magnetic\nmedia specifications and format for filing Part B of the quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return. Upon successful test completion, the\ndepartment certifies the test tape and informs B of the calendar quarter in\nwhich B must begin filing Part B of the quarterly combined return using\nmagnetic media. B must file using such media in subsequent calendar quarters\neven if B falls below the 250 individual threshold, unless B notifies the\ndepartment, no later than 30 days after the start of the calendar quarter in\nwhich such threshold will not be met, that B no longer wishes to file using\nmagnetic media. (iv)\n\nSpecial\npaper returns. All persons required to file quarterly combined withholding and\nwage reporting returns, including those not required or not electing to file\n\nPart B of such return using magnetic media, shall file Part A of such return\nusing the method prescribed by subparagraph (i) of (ii) of paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision, as applicable. (v) Election to file using magnetic media. Any person not required to file Part B of a quarterly combined withholding and\nwage reporting return with the department using magnetic media may nevertheless\nelect to file Part B of such quarterly combined return using magnetic media by\nfurnishing written notice to the department of such intention. Such person\nshall file the test tape or disk referred to in clause (\nb\n) of\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph and shall not commence magnetic media filing\nof Part B of the quarterly combined return until the department certifies such\ntest tape or disk and informs such person of the calendar quarter in which\nmagnetic media filing may commence. A person electing to file Part B of the\nquarterly combined return may revoke such election by furnishing written notice\nthereof to the department no later than 30 calendar days after the start of the\ncalendar quarter in which magnetic media is no longer intended to be\nutilized. (vi)\n\nInstructions. A\nperson required to file Part B of the quarterly combined withholding and wage\nreporting return using magnetic media pursuant to the provisions of this\nsubdivision shall file Part B of such return in accordance with instructions\npromulgated by the department, and Part B of such return shall contain such\ninformation as the department shall specify in such instructions. (3)\n\nPaper return filing. (i) Use of prescribed New York State paper\nformat. For calendar quarters in which the department does not impose the\nmachine-readable paper form requirement referred to in subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph, any person not required or not electing to file Part B of a\nquarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return using magnetic media\nin accordance with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, and any\nperson filing Part A of a quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting\nreturn, must file Parts A and B of such return for the calendar quarter using\nthe prescribed New York State paper format. No substitutes will be accepted by\nthe department in satisfaction of this filing requirement unless such\nsubstitute is specifically approved for use by the department at least 45 days\nbefore the due date of the applicable return. (ii)\n\nUse of machine-readable paper filing. Any person not required or not electing to file Part B of a quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return using magnetic media in accordance with\nthe provisions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, and any person filing Part\nA of a quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return, may, upon\nadequate advance notice to be provided by the department, be required to file\n\nParts A and B of such return for the applicable calendar quarter using\nmachine-readable paper form in accordance with instructions promulgated by the\ndepartment. (4)\n\nWaiver. The commissioner may waive the requirements of this subdivision if hardship is\nshown in an application filed pursuant to this paragraph. A request for waiver\nshall be in writing and shall be on such form as may be prescribed by the\n\nCommissioner for such purpose. For Part B of quarterly combined withholding and\nwage reporting returns covering calendar quarters beginning after December 31, 1992, such request must be filed no later than 30 days after the start of the\nof the first calendar quarter for which a waiver is requested. In determining\nwhether hardship has been shown, the principal factor to be taken into account\nwill be the amount, if any, by which the cost of filing Part B of the quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return in accordance with this\nsubdivision exceeds the cost of filing Part B of such return on other media. If\nthe commissioner grants a waiver, such waiver shall specify the calendar\nquarter or quarters to which it applies and shall also prescribe the method of\nreporting to be utilized. (h) Failure to perform certain acts\nwith respect to the quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting\nreturn. (1)\n\nFailure to furnish wage\nreporting information. (i) General. Section\n685 (v)(1)\nof the Tax Law\nprovides that if an employer required to file the quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return referred to in this section fails to\ninclude on Part B of such return required quarterly wage reporting information\nrelating to individual employees, or to include such quarterly wage reporting\ninformation which is true and correct, and fails to correct such required\nquarterly wage reporting information after notification by the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance by certified mail, return receipt requested, for more than\n30 days after the mailing of such notice of failure to comply, such employer\nshall, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not\ndue to willful neglect, be liable for a penalty in the following amount for\neach employee required to be included in such return: (a) for the first such failure for one\nreporting period in any eight consecutive reporting periods, up to $1 for each\nsuch employee; (b) for the second\nsuch failure for any reporting period in any eight consecutive reporting\nperiods, up to $5 for each such employee; and\n(c) for the third such failure for any\nreporting period in any eight consecutive reporting periods, and for any such\nfailure in any eight consecutive reporting periods which failure is subsequent\nto the third such failure, up to $25 for each such employee. (ii)\n\nTrue and correct wage\nreporting information. For purposes of this paragraph, an inconsequential error\nor omission is not considered a failure to include true and correct\ninformation. An\ninconsequential error or omission\nmeans any\nfailure that does not prevent or hinder the Department of Taxation and Finance\nfrom processing the wage reporting information shown on Part B of the quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return. The following errors and\nomissions shall never be considered inconsequential: (a) employer and employee identification\nnumbers, (b) a surname of an\nemployee; and\n(c) any monetary\namounts. (iii)\n\nExample. The provisions of this paragraph can be illustrated by the following example\n(assume in such example no reasonable cause and lack of willful neglect with\nrespect to the specified failure): Example: Employer A timely and correctly filed A's wage reporting\nreports on form WRS-2 during calendar years 1990 and 1991. A timely files A's\nfirst quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return covering the\nfirst calendar quarter of 1992 on April 30, 1992. However, on Part B of such\nreturn, A fails to include gross wages for wage reporting purposes with respect\nto 100 of A's employees. A fails to correct such omission within 30 days after\nbeing notified thereof by the Department of Taxation and Finance by certified\nmail, return receipt requested. Based upon the foregoing, A would be liable for\na penalty of up to one dollar for each such employee (or up to $100 in the\naggregate), and for any other penalty or addition to tax as may be prescribed\nby law. If A, when timely filing A's quarterly combined withholding and wage\nreporting return covering the second calendar quarter of 1992, fails to include\non Part B of such return gross wages for wage reporting purposes with respect\nto 50 of A's employees, and A fails to correct such omission within 30 days\nafter being notified thereof by the Department of Taxation and Finance by\ncertified mail, return receipt requested, A would be liable for a penalty of up\nto five dollars for each such employee (or up to $250 in the aggregate), and\nfor any other penalty or addition to tax as may be prescribed by law. If A, when timely filing A's quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return\ncovering the third calendar quarter of 1992, fails to include on Part B of such\nreturn gross wages for wage reporting purposes with respect to 75 of A's\nemployees, and A fails to correct such omission within 30 days after being\nnotified thereof by the Department of Taxation and Finance by certified mail, return receipt requested, A would be liable for a penalty of up to $25 for each\nsuch employee (or up to $1,875 in the aggregate), and for any other penalty or\naddition to tax as may be prescribed by law. (2)\n\nFailure to file or late filing. (i) General. Section\n685 (v)(2)\nof the Tax Law\nprovides that if an employer required to file the quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return referred to in this section fails to file\neither Part A or Part B, or both Parts, of such return, or fails to file such\n\nPart or Parts of the return on or before the required due date, such employer\nshall, unless it is shown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not\ndue to willful neglect, pay a penalty equal to the greater of $1,000 or the\nproduct of $50 multiplied by the number of employees shown on Part B of the\nmost recent quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return filed by\nsuch employer for a prior calendar quarter. If no such return has been filed, the number of employees may be estimated by the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance from any information in its possession. However, if the employer files\n\nParts A, B or both, of such employer's quarterly combined withholding and wage\nreporting return, as the case may be, within 30 days after notification of such\npenalty by the Department of Taxation and Finance by certified mail, return\nreceipt requested, then such penalty shall be abated. If the employer files\n\nParts A, B or both, of such return, as the case may be, more than 30 days after\nsuch notification, the employer shall instead pay a penalty equal to the\nproduct of $50 multiplied by the number of employees actually shown on Part B\nof such employer's quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return\nfiled for the calendar quarter in which the failure described in this\nsubparagraph occurred. For purposes of computing the penalty described in this\nparagraph, the number of employees shown on Part B of the employer's quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return shall be determined in\naccordance with the aggregation rules prescribed by subparagraph (g)(2)(ii) of\nthis section. The total amount of the penalty imposed pursuant to section\n685 (v)(2)\nof the Tax Law\nfor each such failure in a calendar quarter cannot exceed $10,000. (ii)\n\nExample: The provisions of this\nparagraph can be illustrated by the following example (assume in such example\nno reasonable cause and lack of willful neglect with respect to the specified\nfailure): Example: Employer C timely files C's quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return for the first calendar quarter of a\ncalendar year, properly showing thereon information relating to five employees. In the second calendar quarter of such calendar year, C fails to file Part B of\nC's quarterly combined return. C receives notice of a $1,000 penalty pursuant\nto Tax Law, section 685(v)(2) from the Department of Taxation and Finance by\ncertified mail, return receipt requested. C files Part B of C's quarterly\ncombined return after 30 days of receiving such notification, properly showing\nthereon information relating to five employees for such calendar quarter. C is\nliable for a penalty of $250 pursuant to Tax Law, section 685(v)(2), determined\nby multiplying $50 by the five employees actually shown on Part B of the late\nfiled quarterly combined return, and for any other penalty or addition to tax\nas may be prescribed by law (for example, Tax Law, section 685[v] [1]). Note\nhowever that if C never files Part B of C's quarterly combined return for such\ncalendar quarter, C would be liable for a penalty of $1,000 pursuant to section\n685 (v)(2)\nof the Tax Law\nand for any other penalty or addition to tax as may be prescribed by law (for\nexample, Tax Law, section 685[v][1]). (3)\n\nFailure to furnish annual employee\nspecific withholding reconciliation information. (i) General. Section\n685 (v)(3)\nof the Tax Law\nprovides that if an employer fails to include all of the annual employee\nspecific withholding reconciliation information required to be shown on Part B\nof the quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return covering the\nlast calendar quarter of a calendar year, such employer shall, unless it is\nshown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful\nneglect, be subject to a penalty equal to $50 multiplied by the number of\nemployees for whom information is inaccurate or incomplete. However, if the\nnumber of such employees cannot be determined from the quarterly combined\nreturn, the Department of Taxation and Finance may utilize any information in\nits possession in making such determination. The total amount of the penalty\nimposed pursuant to section\n685 (v)(3)\nof the Tax Law\ncannot exceed $10,000. (ii)\n\nInaccurate annual employee specific withholding reconciliation information. For\npurposes of this paragraph, an inconsequential error or omission is not\nconsidered a failure to include accurate information. An\ninconsequential error or omission\nmeans any failure that does\nnot prevent or hinder the Department of Taxation and Finance from processing\nthe annual employee specific withholding reconciliation information shown on\n\nPart B of the last quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return for\na calendar year. The following errors and omissions shall never be considered\ninconsequential: (a) employer and employee\nidentification numbers; (b) a\nsurname of an employee; and\n(c) any\nmonetary amounts. (iii)\n\nExample: The provisions of this paragraph can be illustrated by the following\nexample (assume in such example no reasonable cause and lack of willful neglect\nwith respect to the specified failures): Example: Employer D timely files D's quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return for the fourth calendar quarter of a\ncalendar year. On Part B of such return, D properly indicates the employer\nidentification and name of each of D's 50 employees. However, D fails to\nprovide information relating to gross wages paid to each of D's employees\nduring such fourth calendar quarter, and also fails to provide annual\nreconciliation information relating to wages subject to withholding paid to\neach of D's employees. D is liable for a penalty of $2,500 pursuant to section\n685 (v)(3)\nof the Tax Law, and for any other penalty or addition to tax as may be prescribed by law (for\nexample, Tax Law, section 685[v][1]). (4)\n\nFailure to include complete or correct\nnonemployee specific information. (i) General. Section\n685 (v)(4)\nof the Tax Law\nprovides that if an employer fails to include required quarterly information\nnot relating to individual employees on Part A of the quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return, or to include such required quarterly\ninformation which is true and correct, such employer shall, unless it is shown\nthat such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, be\nsubject to a penalty equal to five percent of the quarterly withholding tax\nliability required to be shown by such employer for the quarter covered by such\nreturn. If such liability required to be shown by such employer for the quarter\ncannot be ascertained, the Department of Taxation and Finance may estimate such\nliability from any information in its possession. However, if the employer\ncorrects such employer's failure within 30 days after a notification has been\nsent by the department by certified mail, return receipt requested, informing\nsuch employer of the penalty, then, such penalty shall be abated. No penalty\nshall be imposed if the department is able to properly verify and reconcile\nwithholding and wage reporting information using the information furnished by\nthe employer. The total amount of the penalty imposed pursuant to section\n685 (v)(4)\nof the Tax Law\nfor each such failure in a calendar quarter cannot exceed $10,000. (ii)\n\nInaccurate nonemployee specific\ninformation. For purposes of this paragraph, an inconsequential error or\nomission is not considered a failure to include true and correct information. An\ninconsequential error or omission\nmeans any failure that\ndoes not prevent or hinder the Department of Taxation and Finance from\nprocessing Part A of the quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting\nreturn. The following errors and omissions shall never be considered\ninconsequential: (a) employer identification\nnumber; (b) failure to properly\nidentify the calendar quarter and year for which Part A of the quarterly\ncombined return is being filed; and\n(c) any monetary amounts. (iii)\n\nProper verification and\nreconciliation. (a) Part A filers. Where the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance is able to verify an employer's withholding\nand wage reporting information using employer's returns of tax withheld (form\nWT-1) and information on Part A of such employer's quarterly combined return\nfor the same calendar quarter showing the date of each payroll made by such\nemployer after which an employer's return of tax withheld was required to be\nfiled and a remittance of withheld taxes was required to be made, and the total\ntaxes withheld in each payroll period by such employer, then no penalty shall\nbe imposed pursuant to section\n685 (v)(4)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (b) Form WT-4AEZ filers. Where\nan employer indicates, on such employer's form WT-4AEZ portion of the quarterly\ncombined return, information relating to the total amount of taxes withheld by\nsuch employer for the calendar quarter covered by such return, then no penalty\nshall be imposed pursuant to section\n685 (v)(4)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (iv)\n\nExample. The\nprovisions of this paragraph can be illustrated by the following example\n(assume in such example no reasonable cause and lack of willful neglect with\nrespect to the specified failure): Example: Employer E timely files Part B of E's quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return for the third calendar quarter of a\ncalendar year. However, E fails to file therewith Part A of such quarterly\ncombined return. E fails to file Part A of E's quarterly combined return within\n30 days after receiving notification of the penalty prescribed by Tax Law, section 685(v)(4) by certified mail, return receipt requested. The Department\nof Taxation and Finance is unable to properly verify and reconcile E's\nwithholding and wage reporting information for the calendar quarter. E will be\nliable for the penalty prescribed by section\n685 (v)(4)\nof the Tax Law\nand for any other penalty or addition to tax as may be prescribed by law (for\nexample, section\n685[v][2] of the Tax\n\nLaw). (5)\n\nFailure\nto utilize proper format. (i) General. Section\n685 (v) (5)\nof the Tax Law\nprovides that if an employer who is subject to, or who elects to be subject to, the provisions of section\n658 (d)(2)\nof the Tax Law\nand subdivision (g) of this section fails to file Part B of a quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return using the format prescribed by\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance pursuant to the authority of such\nsection 658(d)(2) and such subdivision (g), such employer shall, unless it is\nshown that such failure is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful\nneglect, be deemed to have failed to file such return and shall be liable for\nthe penalty prescribed by section\n685 (h)(1)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (ii)\n\nExamples. The provisions\nof this paragraph can be illustrated by the following examples (assume no\nreasonable cause and lack of willful neglect for the specified failures): Example 1: Employer F is required to file Part B of F's quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting returns using magnetic media pursuant\nto section\n658 (d)(2)\nof the Tax Law\nand subdivision (g) of this section. F must include 300 individuals on Part B\nof F's quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return covering the\nfirst calendar quarter of a calendar year. F, without a waiver, timely files\nF's Part B on paper rather than utilizing magnetic media. F will be liable for\na penalty of $10,000 for such failure. Example 2: Assume the same facts as in example 1, except that F\ntimely files Part B of F's quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting\nreturn utilizing a magnetic media format which the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance cannot process. F will be liable for a penalty of $10,000 for such\nfailure. (6)\n(i) Comprehensive example. The following\nexample illustrates that all of the provisions of section\n685 (v)\nof the Tax Law may\napply to the same set of facts (assume in such example no reasonable cause and\nlack of willful neglect with respect to the specified failures): Example: Assume that employer G fails to timely file Parts A and B\nof G's quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return for the fourth\ncalendar quarter of a calendar year. Also assume that G is required to submit\n\nPart B of such return using the format prescribed by section\n658 (d)(2)\nof the Tax Law\nand subdivision (g) of this section and that this is G's first failure to file\n\nPart B using the prescribed format during the calendar year. G will be liable\nfor the penalties prescribed by Tax Law, section 685(v)(3) and (v)(5), and if G\nfails to correct its errors within the applicable time periods prescribed by\n\nTax Law, section 685(v)(1), (2) and (4), G will also be liable for such\npenalties and for any other penalties or additions to tax as may be prescribed\nby law. (ii)\n\nExample\nillustrating abatement provisions. The following example illustrates\napplication of the abatement provisions of Tax Law, section 685(v)(1), (2) and\n(4): Example: Assume the same facts as in the example in subparagraph\n(i) of this paragraph, except that G files both Parts A and B of G's quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return within the applicable time\nperiods prescribed by Tax Law, section 685(v)(1), (2) and (4). Further assume\nthat when filing such Parts A and B, G includes both true and correct wage\nreporting information and non-employee specific withholding information which\nallows the Department of Taxation and Finance to properly verify and reconcile\nG's quarterly withholding information. The penalties prescribed by Tax Law, section 685(v)(1), (2) and (4) will be abated. The penalties prescribed by Tax\n\nLaw, section 685(v)(3) and (5) will not be abated since the statute does not\nprovide for abatement of such penalties. (7)\n\nInteraction between the penalties in\nsection\n685 (v)\nof the Tax Law and\nother penalties. (i) General. Except for the\npenalties prescribed by section\n685 (h)(1)\nof the Tax Law\n(relating to failure to file certain information returns) and section\n685 (k)\nof the Tax Law\n(relating to failure to supply identifying numbers), the penalties prescribed\nby section\n685 (v)\nof the Tax Law shall\nbe in addition to any other penalty or addition to tax provided by law. However, the penalty prescribed by section\n685 (h)(1)\nof the Tax Law\nshall apply as provided in section\n685 (v)(5)\nof the Tax Law\n(see paragraph [5] of this subdivision). (ii)\n\nExamples. The provisions of this\nparagraph can be illustrated by the following examples (assume no reasonable\ncause and lack of willful neglect with respect to the specified failures): Example 1: Employer H does not exceed the $700 threshold for\nremittance of withheld taxes at any time during the first calendar quarter of a\ncalendar year (see section\n174.1\nof this Part). H late files Part A of H's quarterly combined withholding and\nwage reporting EZ return for such quarter, and also late pays H's withheld\ntaxes. Assume that H does not file Part A of such EZ return within 30 days of\nreceiving notice from the Department of Taxation and Finance of the penalty\nprescribed by section\n685 (v)(2)\nof the Tax Law. H\nwill be liable for the penalties prescribed by section\n685 (a)(1) (a)(2) and (v)(2)\nof the Tax Law and for any other penalty or addition to tax prescribed by law\n(for example section\n685[v][4] of the Tax Law), except for the penalties prescribed by section\n685 (h)(1) and (k)\nof the\n\nTax Law. Example 2: Employer I exceeds the $700 threshold during a calendar\nquarter for remittance of withheld taxes and fails to file I's employer's\nreturn of tax withheld on form WT-1 and fails to pay over I's withheld taxes. In addition, I fails to file Part B of I's quarterly combined withholding and\nwage reporting return for such calendar quarter on or before the required due\ndate. Assume that I does not file Part B of such quarterly combined return\nwithin 30 days of receiving notice from the Department of Taxation and Finance\nof the penalty prescribed by section\n685 (v)(2)\nof the Tax Law. I\nwill be liable for the penalties prescribed by Tax Law, section 685(a)(1), (a)(2), (v)(2) and for any other penalty or addition to tax prescribed by law\n(for example section\n685[v][1] of the Tax Law), except for the penalties prescribed by section\n685 (h)(1) and (k)\nof the\n\nTax Law.
