No person shall cause or allow emission of particulates to\nthe outdoor atmosphere from any existing fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst\nregenerator or fluid catalytic unit incinerator-waste heat boiler in excess of\n0.15 grain per cubic foot of exhaust gas, expressed at standard conditions on a\ndry gas basis. An existing emission source is one for which an application for\na permit to construct was received, pursuant to Part 201 of this Subchapter, prior to June 12, 1973.
