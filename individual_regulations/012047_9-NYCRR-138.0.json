  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 138.0 - Statement of policy\n\nState Regulations\n\nChapter 707 of the Laws of 1961 was enacted to reduce the\nfinancial burden on certain State employees transferred, reassigned or promoted\nfor the convenience of the State by reimbursing them for basic expenses\nincurred in transporting themselves, their families and household effects to\ntheir new place of residence. It is not the policy of the State to reimburse\nemployees for related expenses in relocation, such as selling and buying a\nhouse or renting temporary living quarters. For the purpose of reimbursement\nfor moving and travel expenses, State officers and employees are deemed to be\nonly those employed either by the legislative, executive or judicial branch of\n\nState government and paid directly by the State. For the purpose of determining\neligibility for such reimbursement, the term \"officer(s) of the New York State\n\nPolice\" shall include: lieutenants, lieutenants (BCI), captains and captains\n(BCI) and the term \"member(s) of the New York State Police\" shall include: troopers, corporals, sergeants, zone sergeants, technical sergeants, staff\nsergeants, chief technical sergeants, first sergeants, investigators and senior\ninvestigators. Persons employed by political subdivisions of the State or by\npublic authorities are not to be considered as State employees for purposes of\nreimbursement, regardless of the fact that a portion of their compensation may\nbe paid from State funds. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n138.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
