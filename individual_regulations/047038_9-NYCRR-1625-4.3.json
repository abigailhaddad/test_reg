  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1625-4.3 - Use of private automobile\n\nState Regulations\n\nPrivate automobiles with adequate insurance coverage\nmay be used for official travel only when it is to the best interest of the\nauthority. Governing factors will be the availability, cost and schedules of\ntransportation by common carrier. Use of private automobiles is generally not\njustified on a cost basis unless one or more passengers, who would normally\nhave reimbursable transportation expenses, accompany the driver. If the\nauthority determines that the use of a privately owned automobile is to its\nadvantage and properly authorizes its use, reimbursement at a rate equal to\nthat allowed to State employees at that time will be allowed for mileage\ntraveled on official business. However, if the authority determines that the\nper mile rate is not to its advantage, reimbursement for use of a privately\nowned automobile can always be made to the extent of the prevailing first class\nfares per railroad mile charged by common carriers. Charges for garage, parking, gasoline, accessories, repairs, depreciation, antifreeze, towage and\nother similar expenses will not be allowed. Bridge, tunnel and highway tolls\nare reimbursable. Receipts for such tolls are required to be attached to the\nvoucher. New York Thruway charges are reimbursable but not in excess, during\nany one year, of the cost of a yearly permit. Toll charges will be considered\nin determining whether use of automobile is to best interest of the\nauthority. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1625-4.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
