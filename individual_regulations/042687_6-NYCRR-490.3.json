The years 2030\nthrough 2039. (b) '2050s'. The years\n2050 through 2059. (c) '2080s'. The\nyears 2080 through 2089. (d) 'Baseline level'. The average level of the surface of marine or tidal water\nover the years 1995 through 2014. (e) 'Community Risk and Resiliency Act'. Chapter 355 of the Laws of 2014. (f) 'Department'. The New York State\n\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation. (g) 'High-medium projection'. The amount of\nsea level rise that is unlikely (the 75th percentile of New York State Climate\n\nImpacts Assessment projections) to be exceeded by the specified time\ninterval. (h) 'High projection'. The amount of sea level rise that is associated with high rates of melt of\nland-based ice and is very unlikely (the 90th percentile of New York State\n\nClimate Impacts Assessment projections) to be exceeded by the specified time\ninterval. (i) 'Long Island Region'. The marine coast of Nassau and Suffolk counties. (j) 'Lower Hudson-New York City Region'. The\nmain stem of the Hudson River, south from the mouth of Rondout Creek at\n\nKingston, New York, and the marine coast of the five boroughs of New York City\nand the Long Island Sound in Westchester County. (k) 'Low-medium projection'. The amount of\nsea level rise that is likely (the 25th percentile of New York State Climate\n\nImpacts Assessment projections) to be exceeded by the specified time\ninterval. (l) 'Low projection'. The\namount of sea level rise that is very likely (the 10th percentile of New York\n\nState Climate Impacts Assessment projections) to be exceeded by the specified\ntime interval. (m) 'Medium\nprojection'. The amount of sea level rise that is about as likely as not (the\nmean of the 25th- and 75th- percentile New York State Climate Impacts\n\nAssessment projections) to be exceeded by the specified time\ninterval. (n) 'Mid-Hudson Region'. The main stem of the Hudson River, from the federal dam at Troy to the mouth of\n\nRondout Creek at Kingston, New York. (o) 'New York State Climate Impacts\n\nAssessment projections'. Projections based on the outputs of global climate\nmodels, downscaled to New York, and additional information, including\ninformation to account for anticipated changes in the rates of ice melt that\ncannot yet be more rigorously included in quantitative models. (p) 'Rapid Ice Melt Projection'. The amount\nof sea level rise that is plausible in a scenario characterized by rapid melt\nof land-based ice, and instability of ice shelves and marine ice\ncliffs. (q) 'Sea level rise'. The\nincrease in the average level of the surface of marine or tidal water for the\nspecified geographic region. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
