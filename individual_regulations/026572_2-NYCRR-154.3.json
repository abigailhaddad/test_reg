Prior to consideration of a resolution authorizing adoption of\na State-administered defined contribution volunteer firefighter service award\nprogram, or the transfer of a locally-administered defined contribution\nvolunteer firefighter service award program to State administration, the\ngoverning board of a political subdivision shall obtain from the administrator\nan estimate of the annual cost of the State-administered defined contribution\nvolunteer firefighter service award program. In making such estimate, the\nadministrator shall calculate each separate component of the total estimated\ncost of a proposed State-administered defined contribution volunteer\nfirefighter service award program. In the case of a transfer of a\nlocally-administered defined contribution volunteer firefighter service award\nprogram to State administration, the administrator shall also estimate the\nadditional amount, if any, determined to be necessary to fully fund all\nexisting obligations of such program, up to and including contributions for\ncredit for a year of firefighting service performed during the calendar year\nimmediately preceding the year in which State administration is anticipated to\ncommence and unfunded prior service costs.
