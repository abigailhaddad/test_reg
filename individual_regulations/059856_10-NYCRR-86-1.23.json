(g) Substance abuse detoxification inpatient services. For patients discharged on and after December 1, 2008, rates of payment for general hospitals which are certified by the Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services (OASAS) to provide services to patients determined to be in the diagnostic category of substance abuse (MDC 20, DRGs 743 through 751) will be made on a per diem basis. This includes inpatient detoxification, withdrawal, and observation services. Medically managed detoxification services are for patients who are acutely ill from alcohol and/or substance related addictions or dependence, including the need or risk for the need of medical management of severe withdrawal, and/or are at risk of acute physical or psychiatric co-morbid conditions. Medically supervised withdrawal services are for patients at a mild or moderate level of withdrawal, or are at risk for such, as well as patients with sub-acute physical or psychiatric complications related to alcohol and/or substance related dependence, are intoxicated, or have mild withdrawal with a situational crisis, or are unable to abstain yet have no past withdrawal complications. The per diem rates for inpatient detoxification, withdrawal, and observation services will be determined as follows: (1)\n\nThe operating cost component of the per diem rates will be computed using 2006 costs and statistics, excluding physician costs, as reported to the department by general hospitals prior to 2008, adjusted for inflation. The inflation factor will be calculated in accordance with the trend factor methodology described in this Subpart. The average operating cost per diem for the region in which the hospital is located will be calculated using costs incurred for patients requiring detoxification services. The operating cost component of the per diem rates will be transitioned to 2006 as follows: (i) for the period December 1, 2008 through March 31, 2009, 75 percent of the operating cost component will reflect the operating cost component of rates effective for December 31, 2007, adjusted for inflation, and 25 percent will reflect 2006 operating costs in accordance with paragraphs (2) through (6) of this subdivision. (ii)\nfor April 1, 2009 through March 31, 2010, 37.5 percent of the operating cost component will reflect the December 31, 2007 operating cost component, adjusted for inflation, and 62.5 percent will reflect 2006 operating costs in accordance with paragraphs (2) through (6) of this subdivision. (iii)\nfor periods on and after April 1, 2010, 100 percent of the operating cost component will reflect 2006 operating costs in accordance with paragraphs (2) through (6) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nFor purposes of establishing the average operating cost per diem by region for medically managed detoxification and medically supervised withdrawal services, the regions of the state are defined as follows: (i) New York City - Bronx, New York, Kings, Queens and Richmond Counties; (ii)\n\nLong Island - Nassau and Suffolk Counties; (iii)\n\nNorthern Metropolitan - Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester Counties; (iv)\n\nNortheast - Albany, Clinton, Essex, Fulton, Greene, Hamilton, Montgomery, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Warren and Washington Counties; (v) Utica/Watertown - Franklin, Herkimer, Lewis, Oswego, Otsego, St. Lawrence, Jefferson, Chenango, Madison and Oneida Counties; (vi)\n\nCentral - Broome, Cayuga, Chemung, Cortland, Onondaga, Schuyler, Seneca, Steuben, Tioga and Tompkins Counties; (vii)\n\nRochester - Monroe, Ontario, Livingston, Wayne and Yates Counties; and\n(viii)\n\nWestern - Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Niagara, Orleans and Wyoming Counties. (3)\n\nFor each of the regions, the 2006 operating costs incurred by general hospitals in such region for providing care to inpatients requiring detoxification services, as defined by OASAS, and reported in the 2006 ICR submitted to the department prior to 2008, are adjusted by a length of stay (LOS) factor. This LOS factor reflects the loss of revenue due to the reduction of payments for services over the 5th day of stay. The total adjusted operating costs for each region, divided by the total regional days, is the average operating cost per diem for the region. (4)\n\nThe per diem rates for inpatients requiring medically managed detoxification services will reflect 100 percent of the average operating cost per diem for the region in which the hospital is located, adjusted for inflation, for the first five days of service. However, such payments will be reduced by 50 percent for services provided on the 6th through 10th day of service. No payments will be made for any services provided on and after the 11th day. (5)\n\nPer diem rates for inpatients requiring medically supervised withdrawal services, will reflect 100 percent of the average operating cost per diem for the region in which the hospital is located, adjusted for inflation, for the period January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2009. For periods on and after January 1, 2010, the per diem rates for withdrawal services will reflect 75 percent of the average operating cost per diem for the region, adjusted for inflation, and will be reduced by 50 percent for care provided on the 6th through 10th day of service. No payments will be made for any services provided on and after the 11th day. (6)\n\nPer diem rates for inpatients placed in observation beds, as defined by OASAS, will reflect 100 percent of the average operating cost per diem for the region in which the hospital is located, adjusted for inflation, and will be paid for no more than two days of care. After two days of care the payments will reflect the patient's diagnosis as requiring either detoxification or withdrawal services. The days of care in the observation beds will be included in the determination of days of care for either detoxification or withdrawal services. Furthermore, days of care provided in observation beds will, for reimbursement purposes, be fully reflected in the computation of the initial five days of care. (7)\n\nCapital cost reimbursement for the general hospitals which are certified by OASAS to provide substance abuse services will be based on the current reimbursement methodology for determining allowable capital for exempt unit per diem rates. Such capital cost will be added to the applicable operating cost component as a per diem amount to establish the per diem rate for each service. (h) Hospitals or distinct units of hospitals that fail to maintain qualifying criteria for exempt status for reimbursement purposes, as set forth in this section or in section 2807-c(4)(e-2) of the Public Health Law, shall continue to be reimbursed in accordance with such exempt status until the commencement of the next rate period, as determined by the department. (i) Rates of payment for inpatient services for exempt distinct units of hospitals described in subdivisions (a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) of this section, for which separately identifiable 2005 reported costs data are not available, shall reflect the average reported 2005 operating cost per day for comparable exempt units, as determined by the department. (j) Rates of payment for inpatient services described in subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section which utilize regional averages for determining a cost ceiling shall utilize regions of the State set forth in section\n2807-c (4)(l)(iii)(E)\nof the Public Health Law and this subdivision, except that if the otherwise applicable region has less than five exempt hospitals or units in the service, facilities located in the nearest regions will be used to establish a minimum of five hospital or units for the purpose of determining ceilings. Such regions are as follows: (1)\n\nNew York City, consisting of the Counties of Bronx, New York, Kings, Queens and Richmond; (2)\n\nLong Island, consisting of the Counties of Nassau and Suffolk; (3)\n\nNorthern Metropolitan, consisting of the Counties of Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan, Ulster and Westchester; (4)\n\nNortheast, consisting of the Counties of Albany, Clinton, Essex, Fulton, Greene, Hamilton, Montgomery, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Warren and Washington; (5)\n\nUtica / Watertown, consisting of the Counties of Franklin, Herkimer, Lewis, Oswego, Otsego, St. Lawrence, Jefferson, Chenango, Madison and Oneida; (6)\n\nCentral, consisting of the Counties of Broome, Cayuga, Chemung, Cortland, Onondaga, Schuyler, Seneca, Steuben, Tioga and Tompkins; (7)\n\nRochester, consisting of the Counties of Monroe, Ontario, Livingston, Wayne and Yates; (8)\n\nWestern, consisting of the Counties of Allegany, Cattaraugus, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Niagara, Orleans and Wyoming. (k) Capital cost components of per diem rates determined pursuant to this section shall be computed on the basis of budgeted capital costs allocated to the exempt hospital or distinct unit of a hospital pursuant to the provisions of section\n86-1.25\nof this Subpart divided by exempt hospital or unit patient days reconciled to actual total expense. (l) New hospitals and new hospital units. The operating cost component of rates of payment for new hospitals, or hospital units, without adequate cost experience shall be computed based on either budgeted cost projections, subsequently reconciled to actual reported cost data, or the regional ceiling calculated in accordance with subdivision (i) of this section, whichever is lower. The capital cost component of such rates shall be calculated in accordance with section\n86-1.25\nof this Subpart. (m) Inpatient psychiatric services. Per diem rates of payment for a general hospital or a distinct unit of a general hospital for inpatient psychiatric services shall continue to be determined in accordance with the reimbursement methodology set forth in section\n86-1.57\nof this Subpart which was in effect for periods prior to December 1, 2009.
