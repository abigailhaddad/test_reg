  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 r. 202.70.11-c - Discovery of Electronically Stored Information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Parties and nonparties should consult the\n\nCommercial Division's Guidelines for Discovery of Electronically Stored\n\nInformation (\"ESI'') (the \"ESI Guidelines''), which can be found in Appendix A\nto these Rules of the Commercial Division. The ESI Guidelines are advisory and\nshould be applied to the extent appropriate under the circumstances. (b) Prior to the preliminary conference, counsel shall confer with regard to electronic discovery topics, including\nthose set forth in the ESI Guidelines. Topics on which the parties cannot agree\nshall be addressed with the court at the preliminary conference. (c) Requests for the production of ESI may\nspecify the format in which ESI shall be produced, to which the responding\nparty may object. In the absence of such specification, or agreement among the\nparties or court order, the production of electronic documents shall be in the\nform in which it is ordinarily maintained, or in a searchable format that is\nusable by the party receiving the ESI. (d) The costs and burdens of discovery of ESI\nshall be proportionate to its benefits, considering the nature of the dispute, the amount in controversy, and the importance of the materials requested to\nresolving the dispute. A court may deny or modify disproportionate requests or\norder disclosure on condition that the requesting party advance the reasonable\ncost of production to the other side, subject to the allocation of costs in the\nfinal judgment. (e) The requesting\nparty shall promptly defray the reasonable expenses associated with a\nnonparty's production of ESI, in accordance with CPLR 3111 and\n3122(d). (f) The parties are\nencouraged to use efficient means to identify ESI for production, which may\ninclude technology-assisted review in appropriate cases. The parties shall\nconfer, at the outset of discovery and as needed throughout the discovery\nperiod, about technology-assisted review mechanisms they propose to use in\ndocument review and production. (g) Inadvertent or unintentional production of ESI or documents containing\ninformation that is subject to the attorney-client privilege, work product\nprotection, or other generally recognized privilege shall not be deemed a\nwaiver in whole or in part of such privilege if the producing party (i) took\nreasonable precautions to prevent disclosure, and (ii) after learning of the\ninadvertent disclosure, promptly gave notice either in writing, or later\nconfirmed in writing, to the receiving party or parties that such information\nwas inadvertently produced and requests that the receiving party or parties\nreturn or destroy the produced ESL Upon such notice, or as otherwise required, the receiving party or parties shall promptly return or destroy all such\nmaterial, including copies, except as may be necessary to bring a challenge\nbefore the Court. The parties may extend or modify the protections and duties\nof this provision by written agreement, as provided in Rule 11-g(c), which\nshall be submitted to the Court to be ordered. Nothing in this rule shall\nabridge a lawyer's obligations under Rule 4.4(b) of the New York Rules of\n\nProfessional Conduct concerning a lawyer's receipt of documents that appear to\nhave been inadvertently sent. (h) Consistent with CPLR 3126, a party should take reasonable steps to preserve ESI\nthat it has a duty to preserve. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
