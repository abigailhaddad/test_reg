  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 65.4 - Prices to retailers\n\nState Regulations\n(Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, § 101-b)\n(a) The price to retailers, except retailers\noperating railroad cars, shall include federal customs duties, internal revenue\ntaxes, State taxes and fees and cost of delivery to the retailer. The price to\nretailers operating railroad cars may be scheduled at a price \"ex State taxes\nand fees\", but shall include all of the other taxes and costs computed in\nprices to other retailers. No charge shall be made in addition thereto, except\nwhere a wholesaler lists in his schedule those counties in which no charge for\ndelivery will be made, in all other counties the actual cost of delivery shall\nbe charged to the retailer in addition to the price set forth in the schedule\nand shall be so indicated on the invoice. (b) A delivery charge may be made for certain\nbrands and not for other brands, provided it is so indicated on the schedule of\nprices to retailers. (c) All sales\nto airline company retail licensees shall be at price schedule prices, except\n\"in bond\" sales to aircraft companies holding permits under section\n99-b. (d) The bottle or case price\nof an item of liquor or wine listed in a schedule of liquor or wine prices to\nretailers shall not be changed from the price theretofore listed in the prior\nschedule of liquor or wine prices to retailers except insofar as such change\nmay be required or permitted pursuant to the provisions of 3(b) of section\n101-b (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law), or after prior permission of the\nauthority for good cause shown and for reasons not inconsistent with the\npurpose of section 101-b. (e) Split\n\nCase Fees: In accordance with the anti-discrimination provisions of section\n101-b(2) (Alcoholic Beverage Control Law), for each item of liquor or wine\nlisted in the schedule of prices to retailers, prices shall be posted for (i)\nthe price of a case and (ii) the price of a bottle. For purchases involving\nless than a case, a split case fee may be added to the price of each bottle, but in an amount that would total no more than $7.39 per case. For example, where a case with 12 bottles has a price of $120 ($10 per bottle), the maximum\nprice for each bottle, rounding to the nearest cent, would be $10.62: $127.39\ndivided by 12. For a 24 bottle case with a price of $240, the maximum price for\neach bottle would be $10.31: $247.39 divided by 24. In the schedule of prices\nto retailers posted pursuant to the provision of 3(b) of section 101-b\n(Alcoholic Beverage Control Law), the listing for the price of a bottle shall\ninclude the split case fee for each bottle. In the examples above, the posted\nprice of a bottle would be $10.62 or $10.31 respectively, not $10. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
