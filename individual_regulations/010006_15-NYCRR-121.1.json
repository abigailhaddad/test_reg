  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 121.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n\nArticle 2-A was added to the Vehicle and Traffic Law\n(effective July 1, 1970) in response to court procedures which were too\ncumbersome to handle the relatively large volume of traffic violations. It was\ndecided that noncriminal traffic cases could be more effectively handled\nadministratively by the Department of Motor Vehicles. The Commissioner of Motor\n\nVehicles was authorized by this law (L. 1969, ch. 1074, as amended) to\nestablish a system for the administrative adjudication of moving traffic\ninfractions and to promulgate regulations detailing the procedure. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n121.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
