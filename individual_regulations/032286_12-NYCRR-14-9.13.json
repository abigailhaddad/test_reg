  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.13 - Safety valve construction and rating\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To insure the valve being free, each\nsafety valve shall have a substantial lifting device by which the valve disk\nmay be positively lifted from its seat when there is at least 75 percent of\nfull working pressure on the boiler. The lifting device shall be such that it\ncannot lock or hold the valve disk in lifted position when the exterior lifting\nforce is released. Disks of safety relief valves used on high-temperature water\nboilers shall not be lifted while the temperature of the water exceeds 200°\nFahrenheit. If it is desired to lift the valve disk to assure that it is free, this shall be done when the valve is subject cent of the set pressure. For\nhigh-temperature water boilers, the lifting mechanism shall be sealed against\nleakage. (b) The seats and disks of\nsafety valves shall be of suitable material to resist corrosion. The seat of a\nsafety valve shall be fastened to the body of the valve in such a way that\nthere is no possibility of the seat lifting. (c) The spring shall be designed so that the\nfull lift spring compression shall be no greater than 80 percent of the nominal\nsolid deflection. The permanent set of the spring (defined as the difference\nbetween the free height and height measured 10 minutes after the spring has\nbeen compressed solid three additional times after presetting at room\ntemperature) shall not exceed 0.5 percent of the free height. (d) (1)\n\nThe\nspring in a safety valve or safety relief valve shall not be reset for any\npressure more than five percent above or below that for which the valve is\nmarked unless the new setting is within the spring design range established by\nthe manufacturer or is determined to be acceptable to the manufacturer. If the\nset pressure is to be adjusted within the limits specified above, the\nadjustment shall be performed by the manufacturer, its authorized\nrepresentative, or an assembler. An additional valve data tag identifying the\nnew set pressure, capacity, and date shall be furnished and installed, and the\nvalve shall be resealed. (2)\n\nIf the\nset pressure of a valve is changed so as to require a new spring, the spring\nshall be acceptable to the manufacturer. The spring installation and valve\nadjustment shall be performed by the manufacturer, its authorized\nrepresentative, or an assembler. A new nameplate shall be furnished and\ninstalled, and the valve shall be resealed. (e) A safety valve over three inches in size, used for pressures greater than 15 psi gage, shall have a flanged inlet\nconnection or a welding end inlet connection. The dimensions of flanges\nsubjected to boiler pressure shall conform to the American National\n\nStandards. (f) When the valve\ncasing is marked as required by section\n14-9.8\nof this Subpart, it shall\nbe the guarantee by the manufacturer that the valve also conforms to the\ndetails of construction herein specified. (g) All safety valves shall be so constructed\nthat the failure of any part cannot obstruct the free and full discharge of\nsteam from the valve. Safety valves shall be of the direct spring loaded pop\ntype, with seat inclined at any angle between 45 and 90 degrees, inclusive, to\nthe center line of the spindle. The maximum rated capacity of a safety valve\nshall be determined by actual steam flow at a pressure of three percent in\nexcess of that at which the valve is set to blow, and with a blowdown in\naccordance with section\n14-9.12\nof this Subpart and\ncredited with 90 percent of the flow developed. (h) Safety valves may be used which give any\nopening up to the full discharge capacity of the area of the opening of the\ninlet of the valve, provided the movement of the valve is such as not to induce\nlifting of water in the boiler. (i) Dead-weight or weighted-lever safety valves shall not be used. (j) For high-temperature water boilers safety\nrelief valves shall be used. Such valves shall have a closed bonnet. For\npurposes of selection the capacity rating of such safety relief valves shall be\nexpressed in terms of actual steam flow determined on the same basis as for\nsafety valves. In addition, the safety relief valves shall be capable of\nsatisfactory operation when relieving water at the saturation temperature\ncorresponding to the pressure at which the valve is set to blow. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.13\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
