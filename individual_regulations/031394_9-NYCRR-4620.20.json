  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4620.20 - Fruit Wheel\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Equipment. A\nwheel of variable size. Around the rim of the wheel's surface are sections, each of which shows three symbols bearing different combinations of six\ndifferent types of fruit or similar objects. The wheel has a corresponding\nlayout. (b) The play. (1)\nA player places a wager on one or more\nbetting spaces on the layout and the dealer spins the wheel. When the wheel\nstops, the section in which the indicator arm rests is the winning\ncombination. (2)\n\nIf the player\nplaces a wager on the lemon and the wheel stops at lemon-orange-cherry, the\npayoff odds are 1-to-1 since the lemon showed only once. If the wheel stops at\nlemon-cherry-lemon the payoff odds are 2-to-1 since the lemon showed twice. This holds true for all the types of symbols, e.g., if the player places a\nwager on the apple and the wheel stops on apple-grape-banana, the payoff odds\nare 1-to-1. If the wheel stops at apple-apple-apple, the payoff odds are\n3-to-1. (3)\n\nThe maximum bet shall\nbe $5 or its equivalent in chips. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4620.20\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
