(i) No remedial party shall suffer\nany penalty or be subject to any proceeding or action if it cannot comply with\nany requirement of an order, agreement or State assistance contract to\nimplement all or part of a remedial program if the failure to comply is the\nresult of a force majeure event. A force majeure event shall include acts of\n\nGod, work stoppages due to labor disputes or strikes, fires, explosions, epidemics, riots, war rebellion, sabotage or any other fact or circumstance\nbeyond the reasonable control of the remedial party. If a failure of or delay\nin performance by the remedial party results from the occurrence of a force\nmajeure event, the delay shall be excused and the time for performance extended\nby a period equivalent to the time lost because of the force majeure event, if\nand to the extent that the: (a) delay or\nfailure was beyond the control of the remedial party affected and not due to\nits fault or negligence; (b) delay\nor failure was not extended because of the remedial party's failure to use all\nreasonable diligence to overcome the obstacle or to resume performance\nimmediately after such obstacle was overcome; (c) remedial party provides notice to the\ndepartment within five days of the onset of the event, that it is invoking the\nprotection of this provision; and\n(d) notice shall include the measures taken\nand to be taken to prevent or minimize any delays and may request an\nappropriate extension or modification as appropriate.
