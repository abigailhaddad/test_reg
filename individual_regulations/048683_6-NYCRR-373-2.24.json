  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.24 - Miscellaneous units\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The requirements in this section apply to owners and\noperators of facilities that treat, store, or dispose of hazardous waste in\nmiscellaneous units, except as section\n373-2.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. (b) Environmental performance\nstandards. A miscellaneous unit must be located, designed, constructed, operated, maintained, and closed in a manner that will ensure\nprotection of human health and the environment. Permits for miscellaneous units\nare to contain such terms and provisions as necessary to protect human health\nand the environment, including but not limited to, as appropriate, design and\noperating requirements, detection and monitoring requirements and requirements\nfor responses to releases of hazardous waste or hazardous constituents from the\nunit. Permit terms and provisions must include those requirements of sections\n373-2.9 through\n373-2.15\nand sections 373-2.27\nthrough\n373-2.29\nof this Subpart, Subpart\n373-1 of this Part, and 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE, as incorporated by\nreference in and implemented by section\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title, that are appropriate for the miscellaneous unit being permitted. Protection of human health and the environment includes, but is not limited\nto: (1)\n\nPrevention of any releases\nthat may have adverse effects on human health or the environment due to\nmigration of waste constituents in the groundwater or subsurface environment, considering: (i) the volume and physical and\nchemical characteristics of the waste in the unit, including its potential for\nmigration through soil, liners, or other containing structures; (ii)\nthe hydrologic and geologic\ncharacteristics of the unit and the surrounding area; (iii)\nthe existing quality of groundwater, including other sources of contamination and their cumulative impact on the\ngroundwater; (iv)\nthe quantity and\ndirection of groundwater flow; (v) the proximity to and withdrawal rates of current and potential groundwater\nusers; (vi)\nthe patterns of land\nuse in the region; (vii)\nthe\npotential for deposition or migration of waste constituents into subsurface\nphysical structures, and into the root zone of food-chain crops and other\nvegetation; (viii)\nthe potential\nfor health risks caused by human exposure to waste constituents; and\n(ix)\nthe potential for damage to domestic\nanimals, wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by\nexposure to waste constituents. (2)\n\nPrevention of any releases that may have\nadverse effects on human health or the environment due to migration of waste\nconstituents in surface water, or wetlands or on the soil surface considering: (i) the volume and physical and chemical\ncharacteristics of the waste in the unit; (ii)\nthe effectiveness and reliability of\ncontaining, confining, and collecting systems and structures in preventing\nmigration; (iii)\nthe hydrologic\ncharacteristics of the unit and the surrounding area, including the topography\nof the land around the unit; (iv)\nthe patterns of precipitation in the region; (v) the quantity, quality, and direction of\ngroundwater flow; (vi)\nthe\nproximity of the unit to surface waters; (vii)\nthe current and potential uses of\nnearby surface waters and any water quality standards established for those\nsurface waters; (viii)\nthe existing\nquality of surface waters and surface soils, including other sources of\ncontamination and their cumulative impact on surface waters and surface\nsoils; (ix)\nthe patterns of land\nuse in the region; (x) the\npotential for health risks caused by human exposure to waste constituents; and\n(xi)\nthe potential for damage\nto domestic animals, wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures\ncaused by exposure to waste constituents. (3)\n\nPrevention of any release that may have\nadverse effects on human health or the environment due to migration of waste\nconstituents in the air, considering: (i) the\nvolume and physical and chemical characteristics of the waste in the unit, including its potential for the emission and dispersal of gases, aerosols and\nparticulates; (ii)\nthe\neffectiveness and reliability of systems and structures to reduce or prevent\nemissions of hazardous constituents to the air; (iii)\nthe operating characteristics of the\nunit; (iv)\nthe atmospheric, meteorologic, and topographic characteristics of the unit and the surrounding\narea; (v) the existing quality of\nthe air, including other sources of contamination and their cumulative impact\non the air; (vi)\nthe potential for\nhealth risks caused by human exposure to waste constituents; and\n(vii)\nthe potential for damage to domestic\nanimals, wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by\nexposure to waste constituents. (c) Monitoring, analysis, inspection, response, reporting and corrective action. Monitoring, testing, analytical data, inspections, response, and reporting procedures and frequencies must ensure compliance with\nsections\n373-2.24\n(b), 373-2.2\n(g), 373-2.3\n(d), 373-2.5\n(e), (f) and\n(g) and\n373-2.6\n(l) of this\n\nSubpart as well as meet any additional requirements needed to protect human\nhealth and the environment as specified in the permit. (d) Post-closure care. A miscellaneous unit that is a disposal unit must be\nmaintained in a manner that complies with subdivision (b) of this section\nduring the post-closure care period. In addition, if a treatment or storage\nunit has contaminated soils or groundwater that cannot be completely removed or\ndecontaminated during closure, then that unit must also meet the requirements\nof subdivision (b) of this section during post-closure care. The post-closure\nplan under section\n373-2.7\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart must specify the procedures that will be used to satisfy this\nrequirement. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
