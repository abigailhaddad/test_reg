  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-9.6 - Permit modifications and reopenings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Permit reopening to revise a PAL. The\nfollowing provisions apply to permit reopenings to revise a PAL. (1)\n\nDuring the PAL effective period, the\ndepartment must reopen the permit to: (i) correct typographical/calculation errors made in setting the PAL or reflect a\nmore accurate determination of emissions used to establish the PAL; (ii)\nreduce the PAL if the facility creates\ncreditable emissions reductions for use as emission offsets under this\n\nPart; (iii)\nrevise the PAL to\nreflect an increase in the PAL as provided under subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nThe\ndepartment retains discretion to reopen the permit for the following: (i) reduce the PAL to reflect new applicable\nrequirements with compliance dates after the PAL effective date; (ii)\nreduce the PAL consistent with any other\nrequirement the State may impose on the major facility under the State\n\nImplementation Plan; and\n(iii)\nreduce the PAL if the department determines that a reduction is necessary to\navoid causing or contributing to a NAAQS or PSD increment violation, or to an\nadverse impact on an air quality related value that has been identified for a\n\nFederal class I area by a Federal land manager and for which information is\navailable to the general public. (3)\n\nExcept for permit reopenings for the\ncorrection of typographical or calculation errors that do not increase the PAL, all other reopenings must be processed in accordance with the procedures in\n\nParts 201 and 621 of this Title for a major permit modification. (b) Increasing a PAL during the PAL\neffective period. (1)\n\nUpon request of an\napplicant, the department may increase a PAL during the PAL effective period\nprovided all of the following provisions are met: (i) A complete application for a significant\npermit modification is submitted in accordance with the provisions of Parts 201\nand 621 of this Title requesting an increase in the PAL. Such application must\nidentify the emission source(s) which will have additional emissions that will\ncause the emissions of the facility to equal or exceed its current\nPAL. (ii)\n\nAs part of this\napplication, the facility must demonstrate that the sum of the following two\nitems will exceed the existing PAL: (a) for\nall new or modified emission sources, the sum of the potential to emit of each\nemission source; and\n(b) for all\nother emission sources: (1)\nthe sum of\nbaseline actual emissions of all the minor PAL emission sources; and\n(2)\nthe sum of baseline actual emissions of\nall the significant and major PAL emission sources assuming application of BACT\nor LAER equivalent controls as appropriate. The level of control that would result from the\napplication of BACT or LAER equivalent controls on each significant or major\nPAL emission source must be determined by conducting a new BACT or LAER\nanalysis at the time the application is submitted, unless the emission source\nis currently required to comply with a BACT or LAER requirement that was\nestablished within the preceding 10 years. In such a case, the assumed control\nlevel for that emission source must be equal to the level of BACT or LAER with\nwhich that emission source must currently comply. (iii)\n\nThe facility must obtain a\npermit modification that includes all emission source(s) identified in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, regardless of the magnitude of the\nemissions increase resulting from them. These emission source(s) must continue\nto comply with any other applicable requirements contained in the permit even\nthough they have also become subject to the PAL or continue to be subject to\nthe PAL. (2)\n\nPermit\ncontents. The following provisions, in addition to the other requirements of\nthis Subpart, must be included in the permit authorizing the increased PAL: (i) A provision that the increased PAL will\nbe effective on the date any emission source that is part of the PAL\nmodification becomes operational and begins to emit the PAL\ncontaminant. (ii)\n\nThe new PAL shall\nbe calculated as the sum of the facility potential to emit for each proposed\nnew or modified emission source, plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions\nof the significant and major emission sources (assuming application of BACT or\nLAER equivalent controls as determined in accordance with subparagraph [1][ii]\nof this subdivision) plus the sum of the baseline actual emissions of each\nminor PAL emission source.
