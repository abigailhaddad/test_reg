  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1643-2.4 - Temporary financing: funds borrowed from private investors; initial financing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Resolution authorizing the execution of requisition agreements and the issuance\nof advance loan notes in the aggregate maximum principal amount of the loan\ncontract. This resolution is passed, prior to the initial financing, at the\nsame time as the resolution authorizing the contracting of indebtedness and the\nissuance of certificates of indebtedness. Passage of this resolution indicates\nthat the local agency anticipates borrowing funds required for the temporary\nfinancing of project cost from private investors, rather than from the State. The resolution gives the form of the requisition agreements and advance loan\nnotes but, unlike the resolution authorizing the contracting of indebtedness, does not authorize the officers of the local agency to execute requisition\nagreements and issue advance loan notes, as required. Each requisition\nagreement and each issue of advance loan notes must be authorized by separate\nresolutions of the local agency. Accounting entry: No accounting entry is made to\nreflect passage of this resolution. (b) Resolution authorizing the execution of a\nrequisition agreement and the execution and deposit, in escrow, of an advance\nloan note as security for an issue of temporary loan notes. The passage of this\nresolution represents the second step in the initial financing, where funds are\nto be borrowed from private investors. As previously noted, the advance loan\nnote should be authorized in an amount sufficient to pay the principal of and\ninterest on the temporary loan notes for which it is the security. Inasmuch as\nthe advance loan note is executed in advance of the issuance of the temporary\nloan notes, at which time the actual rate of interest may not yet have been\nfixed, an estimated rate will be used for the purposes of computing the\ninterest to be included in the principal amount of the advance loan note. For\nexample, assume an advance loan note is being prepared in connection with an\nissue of $500,000 principal amount of temporary loan notes, which will have a\nmaturity of six months from date of issue. The interest rate on the latter has\nnot yet been fixed by negotiation with the private investors or through\ncompetitive bidding. Assume that reference to the financial columns of the\nnewspapers or inquiry addressed to the division establishes the fact that\nrecent issues of short term paper by local agencies have carried interest rates\nof one per cent per annum. Application of this rate to the temporary loan notes\nto be issued would give an estimated interest cost of $2,500 which is rounded\noff to the next higher $1,000 and added to the principal amount of the\ntemporary loan notes to give an advance loan note in the amount of $503,000. Accounting entry: No accounting entry is made to\nreflect passage of the resolution authorizing the execution of the requisition\nagreement and the execution and deposit, in escrow, of the advance loan note. The execution and deposit, in escrow, of the advance loan note should be the\nsubject of a balance sheet footnote to the effect that temporary loan notes\noutstanding in the amount of $______ are secured by a requisition agreement and\nan advance loan note in the amount $_____, held in escrow by the ________\nbank. (c) Resolution\nauthorizing the execution and issue of temporary loan notes. (1)\n\nPassage of this resolution is the third\nstep in the initial financing, where funds are to be borrowed from private\ninvestors. Accounting entry: No accounting entry is made to\nreflect the passage of this resolution. (2)\n\nDepending on the expressed wishes of the\nprivate investors, an issue of temporary loan notes may consist of a single\nnote or be broken up into a number of notes. The issue itself is assigned a\nroman numeral for identification purposes. The individual notes comprising the\nissue are called series and are assigned arabic numerals. Thus the initial\nissue of temporary loan notes may consist of three individual notes number I-1, I-2, I-3 and identified as Issue I, Series 1; Issue I, Series 2; Issue I, Series 3, etc. (d) Receipt of proceeds of initial temporary loan note issue. Assuming that the\nlocal agency is to borrow $500,000, the accounting entry for the receipt of the\nproceeds of the initial issue of temporary loan notes is made through the cash\nreceipts register, as follows: Entry (3): Debit: Account 1111, Development Fund $500,000\n\nCredit: Account 2120, Temporary Loan Notes Payable\n$500,000\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1643-2.4\n\nPremiums, if any, received on the sale of the notes\nwill be simultaneously credited through the cash receipts register or general\njournal, as described in section\n1644-2.5. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
