[*]\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the State's rent control and stabilization laws, which protect more than two million New Yorkers, will expire on June 16, 1997\nunless renewed by the State Legislature; WHEREAS, there is concern that if the rent laws expire, unscrupulous landlords may attempt to unlawfully force tenants from their\napartments or engage in illegal rent gouging; WHEREAS, the right to live in peace in one's own home is\nfundamental to the American way of life, and no renters should suffer the\nindignity of being illegally forced from their homes; WHEREAS, illegal acts by building owners that threaten the\nsecurity of a person's home are reprehensible crimes and must be taken\nseriously by all public officials, particularly those charged with prosecuting\nthe law; and\nWHEREAS, unscrupulous owners who attempt to illegally force\ntenants from their homes or engage in unlawful rent gouging must be prosecuted\nto the fullest extent allowed by law; NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE E.

I hereby appoint the Attorney General as Special Prosecutor\nto lead the investigatory and prosecutorial efforts pursuant to this Order. The\n\nAttorney General and such deputies and assistants as he deems necessary shall\nhave the powers and duties specified in subdivision eight of section\nsixty three\nof the\n\nExecutive Law for the purpose of this Order. When making an inquiry pursuant to this Order, the Special\n\nProsecutor shall investigate illegal conduct by building owners against tenants\narising from a lapse of the State's rent control and stabilization laws, in\ncooperation with the district attorney of the county wherein the offense or\nportion thereof is alleged to have been committed. Upon a determination by the\n\nSpecial Prosecutor that there is probable cause to believe a building owner or\nhis agent has engaged in such illegal conduct, the Special Prosecutor shall\nnotify the Counsel to the Governor of the determination, the basis therefor, and the status of the criminal prosecution, if any, against the alleged\nwrongdoer. The Special Prosecutor, his deputies and assistants, and\nany other personnel he deems necessary shall assist in the prosecution of such\ncrimes upon the request of the district attorney. Where such assistance is\nprovided, the district attorney shall retain exclusive authority to direct the\nprosecution of the case, unless otherwise provided by law.

The Special Prosecutor shall report weekly to the Counsel\nto the Governor regarding the implementation of this order, including\ninformation relating to ongoing investigations and criminal prosecutions and\nany recommendations for legislative changes necessary or desirable to\neffectuate the purposes of this Order. I hereby direct the Division of Housing and Community\n\nRenewal (the Division) to establish a toll-free hotline by which tenant\ncomplaints of illegal conduct by building owners or their agents can be\nreported and transmitted forthwith to the Special Prosecutor. Such hotline\nshall be available 24 hours each day beginning on 12:01 a.m. on Monday, June\n16, 1997.
