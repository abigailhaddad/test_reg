The video lottery gaming\nagent may, if approved in writing by the commission, present the main bank\ncashier or cage supervisor with the cash obtained from the count of the drop\nboxes either: (i) at the same time, in which\nevent the cash shall be presented immediately after both counts have been\nconcluded; provided, however, that the video lottery gaming agent shall set\nforth in such agent's system of internal controls the procedures for\nsegregating and securing the cash from the first count that is concluded until\npresented to the main bank cashier or cage supervisor after the conclusion of\nthe second count; or\n(ii)\nseparately, in which event the cash from each count shall be presented\nimmediately after the conclusion of the count; provided, however, that if the\ncash from the first count that is concluded is presented while the second count\nis in progress: (a) there shall be no cash in\nthe count room removed from an opened box that has not already been counted at\nleast once; and; (b) all count room\nemployees shall be required to step away from the count table until the\npresentation is completed and the cash and promotional coupons from the first\ncount are removed from the count room.
