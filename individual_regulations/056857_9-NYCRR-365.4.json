It should\nevaluate the appropriateness of the new residence and whether a violation of\nprobation should be considered. Where judicial approval and/or action is\nrequired or desired, the department should summarize its findings to the court\nof jurisdiction and make a recommendation to the court as to the\nappropriateness of the residence or proposed residence based on the factors and\nconsideration of his/her legal history, adherence to terms and conditions of\nprobation supervision, and compliance with SORA.
