  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 876.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item number. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation assigned to any\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof for the purpose of\nidentification. (1)\n\nThe numbering or index\nsystem used to identify specific waters of New York State was adapted from that\nused by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological survey\nseries of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a drainage\nbasin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name or an\nabbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such number being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Mohawk-Hudson watershed in 1934 and has been closely followed in connection\nwith the identification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the\ntime of its 1934 survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the\nnewer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Mohawk River drainage basin may be illustrated\nas follows: Waters Index\n\nNumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\nH\nHudson River\n\nPrimary Waters\nH-240\n\nMohawk River\n\nThe 240th tributary of the Hudson River numbered\nconsecutively upstream from the mouth. H-240-144\n\nEast Canada Creek\n\nThe 144th tributary of the Mohawk River numbered\nfrom its confluence with the Hudson River. H-240-144-13\n\nSprite Creek\n\nThe 13th tributary of East Canada Creek numbered\nconsecutively upstream from the mouth. H-240-144-13-P 717\n\nCanada Lake\n\nThe 717th pond, lake or reservoir encountered in\nthe biological survey area of the Mohawk River-Upper Hudson River\n\nWatershed. H-240-144-13-P 717-3\n\nIrving Pond Outlet\n\nThe 3rd tributary of Canada Lake numbered in a\nclockwise direction from the outlet. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary, and\nsubtributaries\nshall\nmean any stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any\nother stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries\nare mentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include only the\nstream, pond or other body of surface water designated by such waters index\nnumber; where tributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the\nspecifically designated waters shall include the stream, pond, or other body of\nsurface water designated by such waters index number and all tributaries and\nsubtributaries thereof which are shown on the reference maps, unless exceptions\nare expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in table I shall mean the name by which the\nspecifically designated waters are generally known and which name may appear on\nthe reference maps. In cases of specifically designated waters which have no\nname, the named tributary to which the unnamed waters are tributary are\nidentified as far as possible. (e) Description. The column headed Description contains designations or\nsections of waters to which a particular assignment of a class and standards\nshall apply. Also included in this column is any useful information pertinent\nto the classification and standard. (f) Map Ref. No. as\nappearing in table I means map reference number and indicates one or more of\nthe following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on which\nthe specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown. The\nfollowing maps were produced from original maps which may be procured through\nthe Washington Distribution Section, Geological Survey. Map Ref.
