  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 61-3.5 - Certification procedures\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe general provisions set forth at section\n61-1.5\nof this Part shall apply\nunder this Subpart except as follows: (a) Investigations. For certification under\nthis Subpart, each of the items set forth at section\n61-1.5\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Part will be part of the commissioner's investigation of\napplicants. (b) Examination. (1)\n\nWritten examination. Each applicant for a\ncertificate of competence will, and each applicant for a renewal thereof may, be required by the commissioner to take an appropriate written\nexamination. (2)\n\nPractical\nexamination. An applicant who passes the written examination will also be\nrequired to take a practical examination in crane operation, except that the\ncommissioner may waive this requirement with respect to an applicant for a\nrenewal of a certificate of competence. (i) Conduct of practical examination. The commissioner shall designate one member\nof the examining board to conduct the practical examination for Class F line\ntrucks. For all other practical examinations (for Classes A, B, C, D, and E), the commissioner shall designate a minimum of three members of the examining\nboard to administer the practical examination, of which two members must be\npresent at the practical examination and score the applicant and the other\nmember(s) may review the video of the practical examination and score the\napplicant. When a practical examination is conducted by a single member of the\nexamining board, the applicant must achieve a passing score from the member to\nreceive a certificate of competence. When the practical examination is\nadministered by three or more members of the examining board, the applicant\nmust achieve a passing score, which shall be calculated as an average of all\nscores received from the three or more members that administered the practical\nexamination. The procedures used regarding the conduct of the practical\nexamination, the establishment of the passing score and the assignment of the\nboard members to conduct individual examinations shall be set forth in a\nguidance document approved by the examining board, which shall be made\npublically available. (c) Issuance of certificates without\nexamination. The commissioner may issue a certificate of competence without\nexamination to the holder of a license or certificate issued by another state\nor government entity that allows such holder to operate cranes when, in the\nopinion of the commissioner, the standards used by such entity for the\ncertification or licensing of crane operators are comparable to this\n\nSubpart. (d) Renewals. An\napplication for renewal of a crane operator's certificate of competence shall\nbe made within one year from the expiration date of the certificate sought to\nbe renewed, except that the commissioner may extend the time to make such\napplication.
