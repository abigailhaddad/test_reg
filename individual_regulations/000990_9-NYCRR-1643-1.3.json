  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1643-1.3 - Borrowing from private investors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Temporary loan notes. Local agencies may\nbe authorized or directed by the division to issue their own short term notes\ndirectly to private investors, such as banks, to finance the cost of project\ndevelopment, prior to the issue of housing bonds by the State. These notes are\ntermed temporary loan notes and are issued in anticipation of the loan to be\nmade by the State. Temporary loan notes may have a maturity not in excess of\none year from the date of issue, but subject to prepayment in advance of\nmaturity, and may be refunded, upon maturity, through the sale of a similar\nissue of short-term notes by the local agency, subject to the limitations of\nthe Public Housing Law. Where a project has been declared substantially\ncompleted, the local agency may only issue temporary loan notes that mature\nwithin a period not to exceed one year beyond the date of maturity of notes\noutstanding on the date of substantial completion. Temporary loan notes may\nalso be refunded out of advances made by the State representing either the\nproceeds of a bond issue or an issue of short-term notes by the State. No\nrefunding of temporary loan notes, may, however, take place after the bonds\nhave been issued for same. The Public Housing Law further provides that the\nproceeds of an issue of short-term notes by the local agency in anticipation of\na loan from the State shall be used only for the purposes for which the\nproceeds of the loan itself may be used. (b) Requisition agreements and advance loan\nnotes. Where the temporary financing of project cost is by borrowing from\nprivate investors, such as banks, the security for the temporary loan notes\nissued is a requisition agreement between the State and the local agency and an\nadvance loan note, executed simultaneously with the temporary loan notes and\ndeposited in escrow. The advance loan note is made payable by the local agency\nto the State of New York, is dated as of the date of maturity of the temporary\nloan notes for which the advance loan note is the security, matures one year\nfrom such date and is made out in a principal amount, rounded off to the\nnearest $1,000, sufficient to pay the principal of and the interest on the\ntemporary loan notes. The requisition agreement, in turn, specifies that the\n\nState will purchase the local agency's advance loan note on the date of\nmaturity of the temporary loan notes and that the proceeds of such purchase\nwill be applied to the payment of the principal of and the interest on the\ntemporary loan notes, the balance, if any, being paid to the local agency for\ndeposit in the project's development fund. In the event that the temporary loan\nnotes are refunded, upon maturity, by a similar issue of temporary loan notes, the old requisition agreement and advance loan note are cancelled and replaced\nby a new requisition agreement and advance loan note securing the new issue of\ntemporary loan notes. In the event the State purchases the advance loan note, upon maturity of the temporary loan notes, out of the proceeds of a bond issue\nor an issue of short-term notes, the division will hold the advance loan note\nagainst the receipt of the local agency's certificate of indebtedness. The\nadvance loan note will thereupon be cancelled and returned to the local\nagency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1643-1.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
