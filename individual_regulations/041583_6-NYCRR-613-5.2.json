  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 613-5.2 - General installation, operation, and maintenance requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Installation\nrequirements. (1)\nUST\nsystems. Components of UST systems must meet the requirements of\nsubdivision\n2.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart, with the exception of ASTs, which must meet the requirements of\nsubdivision\n4.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (2)\nAST\nsystems. Components of AST systems must meet the requirements of\nsubdivision\n4.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart, with the exception of USTs, which must meet the requirements of\nsubdivision\n3.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (b) As-built information records. An accurate facility diagram\nthat includes the information specified under subdivision\n2.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart for components of UST systems (with the exception of ASTs), must be\nmaintained until the facility has been permanently closed. (c) Compatibility with biofuel\nblends. (1)\n\nThe operator and tank\nsystem owner must be able to demonstrate compatibility of every component of a\nhydrant system storing petroleum containing either greater than ten percent\nethanol or greater than 20 percent biodiesel, using one of the following\ndocuments: (i) a certification or listing of\nthe tank system component by a nationally recognized, independent testing\nlaboratory for use with the stored biofuel blend; or\n(ii)\na written statement of compatibility\nfrom the tank system component manufacturer. The manufacturer's statement must\nbe in writing, indicate an affirmative statement of compatibility, and specify\nthe range of biofuel blends with which the equipment or component is\ncompatible. (2)\n\nRecordkeeping. Records required by this subdivision must be\nmaintained until the hydrant system is permanently closed in accordance with\nsection 5.6 of this Subpart. (d) Spill and overfill\nprevention. (1)\nUST\nsystems. UST systems must meet the requirements of subdivision\n2.2\n(d) of this\n\nPart, with the exception of ASTs, which must meet the requirements of\nsubdivision\n4.2\n(d) of this\n\nPart. (2)\nAST\nsystems. AST systems must meet the requirements of subdivision\n4.2\n(d) of this\n\nPart, with the exception of USTs, which must meet the requirements of\nsubdivision\n3.2\n(d) of this\n\nPart. (e) Periodic inspection of overfill prevention equipment. Overfill\nprevention equipment associated with USTs that are part of UST systems must\nmeet requirements of subdivision\n2.2\n(e) of this\n\nPart. (f) Periodic\nmonitoring/testing of fill port catch basins and containment sumps used for\ninterstitial monitoring of piping. Fill port catch basins and\ncontainment sumps used for interstitial monitoring of piping that are\nassociated with USTs that are part of UST systems, must meet the requirements\nof subdivision\n2.2\n(f) of this\n\nPart. (g) Leak detection\nequipment periodic testing. Leak detection equipment associated with\ncomponents of UST systems must meet the requirements of subdivision\n2.2\n(g) of this\n\nPart, with the exception of such equipment associated with ASTs. (h) Periodic operation and\nmaintenance walkthrough inspections. (1)\nUST systems. (i) Walkthrough inspections must be performed\nfor UST systems in accordance with subdivision\n2.2\n(h) of this\n\nPart. The inspections must also check the following equipment either every 30\ndays or annually (if confined space entry is required according to the\n\nOccupational Safety and Health Administration): (a) Hydrant pits. Visually\ncheck for damage; remove liquid and debris; and check for leaks. (b) Hydrant piping vaults. Check for leaks. (ii)\n\nThe requirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph do not apply to ASTs, and fill port catch basins, leak detection equipment, and containment sumps, that are associated with ASTs. Such equipment must be inspected in accordance\nwith subdivision\n4.2\n(h) of this\n\nPart. (2)\nAST\nsystems. Walkthrough inspections must be performed for AST systems in\naccordance with subdivision\n4.2\n(h) of this\n\nPart, with the exception of USTs. (i) Operation and maintenance of\ncorrosion protection. (1)\nUST systems. Metal components of UST systems must meet the\nrequirements of subdivision\n2.2\n(i) of this\n\nPart, with the exception of ASTs, which must meet the requirements of\nsubdivision\n4.2\n(i) of this\n\nPart. (2)\nAST\nsystems. Metal components of AST systems must meet the requirements of\nsubdivision\n4.2\n(i) of this\n\nPart, with the exception of USTs, which must meet the requirements of\nsubdivision\n3.2\n(i) of this\n\nPart. (j) Repairs and modifications. (1)\nUST systems. Repairs and\nmodifications to UST systems must meet the requirements of subdivision\n2.2\n(j) of this\n\nPart, with the exception of those made to ASTs, which must meet the\nrequirements of subdivision\n4.2\n(j) of this\n\nPart. (2)\nAST\nsystems. Repairs and modifications to AST systems must meet the\nrequirements of subdivision\n4.2\n(j) of this\n\nPart, with the exception of those made to USTs, which must meet the\nrequirements of subdivision\n3.2\n(j) of this\n\nPart. (k) Hydrant systems in locations subject to flooding. (1)\n\nFor Category 1 or 2 tanks located in an\narea where the tank may become buoyant because of a rise in the water table, flooding, or accumulation of water, safeguards must be maintained in accordance\nwith section 2-5.6 of NFPA 30 (1984 edition). If such safeguards include\nballasting of a tank with water during flood warning periods, tank system\nvalves and other openings must be closed and secured in a locked position in\nadvance of the flood. Ballast water removed from the tank after the flood must\nnot be discharged to the waters of the State unless the discharge is in\nconformance with the standards of Parts 701, 702, 703, and 750 of this Title, as applicable. (2)\n\nFor Category 3\ntanks located in an area where the tank may become buoyant because of a rise in\nthe water table, flooding or accumulation of water from fire suppression\noperations, uplift protection must be provided in accordance with Sections\n22.14 and 23.14 of NFPA 30 (2012 edition). (l) Stormwater management. Stormwater which collects within the secondary containment of ASTs must be\ncontrolled by a manually operated pump or siphon, or a gravity drain pipe which\nhas a manually controlled dike valve on the outside of the dike. All pumps, siphons and valves must be properly maintained and kept in good condition. If\ngravity drain pipes are used, all dike valves must be locked in a closed\nposition except when the operator is in the process of draining clean water\nfrom the diked area. Stormwater or any other discharge at a facility must be\nuncontaminated and free of sheen prior to discharge. Stormwater which is\ncontaminated must not be discharged to the waters of the State unless the\ndischarge is in conformance with the standards of Parts 701, 702, 703, and 750\nof this Title, as applicable.
