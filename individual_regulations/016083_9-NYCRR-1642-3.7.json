  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-3.7 - Cost analysis ledger\n\nState Regulations\nA separate cost analysis ledger, controlled by an\naccount or accounts in the general ledger (depending on whether single or\nmultiple general ledger controls are being operated for account 1400, Development Costs) shall be maintained for each project to record development\ncosts. The division may further require, depending on the circumstances, that\nseparate cost analysis ledgers be maintained for each site included in a\nmultiple development project in which case the local agency will be so advised. Separate cost analysis ledgers, controlled by the respective subsidiary ledger\naccounts shall be maintained for each related program. Binding the various cost\nanalysis ledgers of a project in a single binder is recommended. The cost\nanalysis ledger shall show, in detail, the development costs chargeable to a\nproject. Postings are made to the cost analysis ledger directly from the\naccounts payable and journal vouchers, the detailed costs recorded thereon\nbeing posted individually to the respective cost accounts. Occasional postings\nto the cost analysis ledger may originate from the books of original entry. The\ncost analysis ledger may consist of a card or a loose-leaf sheet for each cost\naccount, as per Exhibit 12 of Appendix S-8 or, alternatively, of a loose-leaf\nsheet for each subgroup of cost accounts with columns for the individual\naccounts, as per Exhibit 13 of Appendix S-8. The former is recommended as\nproviding a continuous record of all transactions affecting a particular cost\nclassification exclusively and as affording better control over commitments and\nexpenditures inasmuch as space is provided for recording the current approved\ndevelopment cost budget figure for the particular cost classification and the\namount requisitioned on the most recent approved certificate of purposes. Cost\nanalysis ledger sheets are provided by the local agency. Stock forms for either\nspecimen, or forms which may be adapted, may be procured at most stationers, either without printing or overprinted. At the end of each calendar month, after all postings have been made, the cost analysis ledger is footed and the\ntotal for each account as of the end of that month is determined. The aggregate\ncumulative totals to date of all accounts, as determined by a monthly trial\nbalance, shall agree with the balance reflected in the 1400 account in the\ngeneral ledger, a suitable grouping in the trial balance being made, of course, if multiple general ledger controls, as described in section\n1642-3.3, are maintained. This\nprocedure produces in readily available form, the controlled figures for\nprevious, current, and cumulative costs required in preparing form DH-213, the\nanalysis of expenditures and budget control statement filed with the periodic\nreports to the division. After footing the cost analysis ledger for the month, transactions for the succeeding month may be recorded immediately following. It\nwill not be necessary to head up a new cost analysis ledger sheet for each new\nmonth if space remains on the sheet used for the previous month. Alternative\nprocedures for determining and recording previous current and cumulative costs, as by a different columnar arrangement of the cost analysis ledger sheet or by\nmachine bookkeeping, may be adopted by the local agency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-3.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
