  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 461.10 - Programmatic or generic environmental impact statements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A programmatic or generic environmental\nimpact statement may be used to assess the environmental effects of: (1)\na number of separate actions in a given\ngeographic area which, if considered singly may have minor effects, but if\nconsidered together may have significant effects; (2)\na sequence of actions, contemplated by\nthe Power Authority, a single agency or individual; (3)\nseparate actions having generic or common\nimpacts; and\n(4)\nprograms or plans\nhaving wide application or restricting the range of future alternative policies\nor projects. (b) Generic\nor programmatic statements should set forth specific conditions or criteria\nunder which future actions will be undertaken or approved, and shall include\nprocedures and criteria for amendments or supplements to reflect impacts, such\nas specific impacts, which cannot be adequately addressed or analyzed in the\ninitial statement. Such procedures shall include provision for public notice of\namendments or supplements which allow for comment thereon in the same manner as\nwas provided by the original statement. (c) When an individual action is proposed\nwhich was encompassed in a programmatic EIS, and the action is to be carried\nout in conformance with the conditions discussed in the programmatic statement, a subsequent EIS evaluating site-specific impacts should be prepared only if\nsite- specific impacts differ significantly from those addressed in the\nprogrammatic statement. (d) In\nconnection with projects that are to be developed in phases or strategies, the\nsite- specific impacts of the individual project under consideration and, in\nmore general or conceptual terms, the cumulative effects on the environmental\nand existing natural resource base of subsequent phases of a large project or\nseries of projects that may be developed in the future, and that are under the\nownership or control of the same project sponsor, should be discussed. In these\ncases, this part of the EIS shall discuss the important elements and\nconstraints present in the natural and man-made environment that may bear on\nthe conditions of a decision on the immediate project.
