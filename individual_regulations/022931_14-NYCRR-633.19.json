Tit. 14 § 633.19 - Confidentiality and protective measures regarding the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (see glossary) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS-see glossary) for a person admitted for service for any party proposed for admission\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Principles of compliance. (1)\n\nIt\nis the policy of OPWDD that any information about anyone applying for services\nor admitted and receiving services, is to be held in confidence. Any\ninformation obtained or to be disclosed is to be done so with the understanding\nthat the information is confidential and is to be maintained exclusively for\nthe purposes of program planning and the provision of competent and humane care\nto that individual. While the requirements of this section address the\nparticular issues of access to person-specific HIV and AIDS information, it is\nthe intent of OPWDD that no such information is to be discussed casually or\ncapriciously. Such person-specific information should only be judiciously\ndisclosed in accordance with law for the purposes of increasing the\nunderstanding of other care-givers about a person's needs and then only\ncare-givers who have or will have responsibilities in addressing that person's\nneeds. (2)\n\nEach agency/facility and\nsponsoring agency for a family care home and its employees, volunteers, and\ncontract agents and family care providers shall ensure the confidentiality of\ninformation in the possession of such agency/facility or sponsoring agency\nconcerning whether that person admitted for service or anyone proposed for\nadmission has been the subject of an HIV-related test (see glossary); or has\nHIV infection (see glossary), HIV-related illness (see glossary), or AIDS; or\nany information indicating a person's possible exposure to HIV. (3)\n\nNo one shall have access to HIV-related\ninformation (see glossary) unless he or she has access to clinical records in\nthe ordinary course of business, has been trained in matters of confidentiality\nand related issues, and access to the HIV-related information is reasonably\nnecessary under the following circumstances: (i) To provide for the appropriate care and\ntreatment of a person as described in his or her program plan except when the\nsole purpose of accessing the information is to monitor or limit behaviors that\ncould result in significant risk (see glossary) contacts; and the program\nplanning team, in consultation with the person, has determined that he or she\nexhibits the capacity and willingness to manage his or her behaviors so that\nthe monitoring or limitations are not necessary. (ii)\n\nIn connection with an investigation of\nan alleged violation of a person's rights, including discrimination or\nabuse. (iii)\n\nTo fulfill a specific\nstatutory duty. (iv)\n\nIn connection\nwith a review of the quality of care rendered by an agency/facility or a family\ncare provider. (v) To determine\neligibility for services or reimbursement of services by OPWDD or the medical\nassistance program (Medicaid).

State law prohibits you from making\nany further disclosure of this information without the specific written consent\nof the person to whom it pertains, or as otherwise permitted by law.
