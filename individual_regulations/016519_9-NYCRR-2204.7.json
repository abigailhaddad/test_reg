  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2204.7 - Alteration or remodeling\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\ncertificate or an order authorizing subdivision shall be issued where the\nlandlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of a housing accommodation\nfor the immediate purpose of substantially altering or remodeling it, provided\nthat the landlord shall have secured such approval therefor as is required by\nlaw, and the administrator determines that the issuance of the order granting\nthe certificate of eviction is not inconsistent with the purpose of the Rent\n\nLaw or these regulations. No certificate or order authorizing subdivision\ninvolving alteration or remodeling shall be granted under this section unless\nthe administrator shall find that such alteration or remodeling is for the\npurpose of subdividing an under-occupied housing accommodation containing six\nor more rooms, exclusive of bathrooms and kitchen, into a greater number of\nhousing accommodations consisting of self-contained family units which meet the\nrequirements of section\n2200.9\nof this Title. An apartment\nmay be deemed under-occupied when there is less than one occupant for each\nroom, exclusive of bathrooms, kitchen and three additional rooms. Roomers or\nboarders who are not members of the tenant's family shall not be counted as\noccupants. (b) Upon approval of\nplans by the city agency having jurisdiction thereof, where such approval is\nrequired, and before proceeding with such alteration or remodeling, application\nshall be made to the administrator for an order directing the tenant occupying\nsuch housing accommodation to remain in possession of an adequate portion\nthereof, as determined by the administrator, and to surrender possession of the\nremainder of said housing accommodation, with a time to be fixed by the\nadministrator. Where it is not practicable for the tenant to remain in\npossession of a portion of the housing accommodation during the alteration, the\nadministrator may require the landlord to furnish a suitable temporary housing\naccommodation to the tenant, not unreasonably distant from the premises being\naltered, and available at a rent not greater than the rent then being paid by\nthe tenant, unless the tenant requests permanent relocation in his answer to\nthe landlord's application. Unless the tenant requests permanent relocation, the order so granted shall be conditioned on the right of such tenant to first\noccupancy of any housing accommodation resulting from such\nalteration. (c) Where the tenant\nhas requested relocation as provided in subdivision (b) of this section, or\nwhere the tenant cannot be adequately housed in any portion of the housing\naccommodation after alteration, a certificate or order authorizing subdivision\nmay only be issued on condition that the landlord comply with the relocation\nrequirements of section\n2204.4\n(e) of this\n\nPart. Such order shall also require the landlord to comply with the stipend\nrequirements of subdivisions (e) and (f) of such section. (d) The administrator shall establish the\nterms and conditions under which such alteration or remodeling may be made, and\nshall establish the maximum rent to be paid by the tenant occupying such\nsuitable portion of such housing accommodation during the alteration, and shall\nestablish the maximum rent to be paid by such tenant for the first occupancy of\nany housing accommodation selected by him in such subdivided housing\naccommodation after it has been altered or remodeled. The administrator shall, pursuant to section\n2202.22\n(a) of this\n\nTitle, establish the maximum rent on the basis of the maximum rents for\ncomparable housing accommodations, after taking into consideration all other\nfactors bearing on the equities involved. The landlord shall file an\napplication under section\n2200.9\nof this Title for an order\nof decontrol; provided, however, that such order of decontrol shall not apply\nto that portion of the original housing accommodations occupied by a tenant in\npossession at the time of the conversion, but only so long as such tenant\ncontinues in occupancy. (e) In the\ncase of housing accommodations in a structure or premises owned by a\ncooperative corporation or association, where the landlord is the individual\nowner of stock allocated to a housing accommodation, no certificate or order\nshall be granted under this section unless the administrator shall also find\nthat the landlord has met the requirements of section\n2204.5\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (f) The order in all such\ncases shall grant the landlord permission to recover possession of the housing\naccommodations without further application, should the tenant fail to abide by\nthe order of subdivision issued by the administrator. (g) Sections\n2204.4\n(g) and (h)\nand\n2204.8\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Part shall not apply with respect to any building consisting of housing\naccommodations falling within the limitations of section\n2204.8\n(c) of this\n\nPart.
