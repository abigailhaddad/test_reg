  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 578.20 - Conversion to a residential treatment facility of an institution previously licensed by the department of social services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Allowable depreciation for the\nresidential treatment facility will be a continuation of the Department of\n\nSocial Services depreciation schedule previously in effect unless the\ncommissioner determines error(s) had been made in that calculation. This\nrequirement may be waived by the commissioner if the circumstances involved are\nfound by the commissioner to be reasonable, necessary and in the public\ninterest with respect to the facility. (b) When an institution converts only part of\nits capacity to a residential treatment facility, allowable depreciation for\nthe facility will be based on the historical cost and useful life of the\nspecific building(s) being converted. (c) The square footage used to determine\nallowable capital-related costs will be as determined by the commissioner in\nconnection with his project approval authority under the Mental Hygiene Law and\n\nPart 551 of this Title. When only a portion of a building is being converted to\na residential treatment facility, the percentage of approved square footage to\ntotal square footage for the building will be used to determine capital-related\ncosts of the residential treatment facility. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 14\n§\n578.20\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
