Tit. 22§ 24.4 - Sick leave\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nSick leave is absence with pay\nnecessitated by the illness or disability of the employee, including illness or\ndisability caused by pregnancy or childbirth. (2)\n\nFor non-Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA)\napproved absences, an employee shall be allowed to charge a maximum of 25 days\nof sick leave in any one calendar year for absences from work to care for a\nclose family member during a time of illness. For purposes of this section, a\nclose family member shall be the employee's spouse; domestic partner; natural, foster or step child; natural, foster or step parent; or any relative residing\nwith the employee or an individual for whom the employee is the primary\ncaregiver. (3)\n\nAn employee who is\napproved for a caregiver leave pursuant to the FMLA shall be allowed to charge\nabsences during the FMLA period to accumulated sick leave. Sick leave charged\nduring the FMLA period shall not be counted towards the 25 days set forth in\nsubsection\n24.4\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis section, i.e., these 25 \"family sick leave\" days remain available for the\nemployee's use before and/or after the FMLA period. (4)\n\nDuring a leave pursuant to the FMLA, employees may charge their leave accruals at the half-time\nrate. (b) Employees shall\nearn sick leave credits at the rate of one-half day per biweekly pay period. No\nmore than 200 days of such credits may be used for retirement service credit\nunless a greater benefit is provdied by law, rule or regulation, and no more\nthan 200 days of such credits may be used to pay for health insurance in\nretirement. (c) An employee shall\nnot earn sick leave credit for any biweekly pay period unless he or she is in\nfull-pay status for at least seven workdays during such biweekly pay\nperiod. (d) A part-time, per diem\nor hourly employee eligible to earn sick leave credits pursuant to this Part\nshall earn sick leave credits as provided herein, but such employee's total pay\nwhen absent on such leave shall be the amount which would have been due if the\nemployee had worked his or her usual number of hours or days during such\nperiod. (e) An employee absent on\nsick leave shall notify his or her supervisor, or the supervisor's designee, of\nsuch absence and the reason therefor on the day of such absence and within 90\nminutes after the beginning of his or her workday; provided, however, that\nwhere the work is such that a substitute may be required, the administrative\nauthority may require earlier notification, but not earlier than two hours\nprior to the beginning of the employee's workday. (f) Sick leave credits may be used in such\nunits as the administrative authority may approve, but shall not be used in\nunits of less than 15 minutes. (g) Before absence for personal illness may be charged against accumulated sick\nleave credits, the administrative authority may require such proof of illness\nas may be satisfactory to the administrative authority, or may require the\nemployee to be examined, at the expense of the Unified Court System, by a\nphysician designated by the administrative authority. In the event of failure\nto submit proof of illness upon request, or in the event that, upon such proof\nas is submitted or upon the report of medical examination, the administrative\nauthority finds that there is not satisfactory evidence of illness sufficient\nto justify the employee's absence from the performance of his or her duties, such absence may be considered as unauthorized leave and shall not be charged\nagainst accumulated sick leave credits. Abuse of sick leave shall be cause for\ndisciplinary action. (h) The\nadministrative authority may require an employee who has been absent because of\npersonal illness, prior to and as a condition of his or her return to duty, to submit medical documentation to establish that he or she is not\ndisabled from the performance of his or her normal duties and that his or her\nreturn to duty will not jeopardize the health of other employees. If the\nmedical documentation provided is deemed insufficient by the administrative\nauthority, the employee may be asked to provide additional medical\ndocumentation, and, if such additional medical documentation is not provided or\nis deemed insufficient, the administrative authority may require the employee, prior to and as a condition of his or her return to duty, to be\nexamined, at the expense of the Unified Court System, by a physician designated\nby the administrative authority, to establish that\nthe\nemployee\nis not disabled from the performance of his or her normal\nduties and that his or her return to duty will not jeopardize the health of\nother employees. (i) In addition to\npersonal illness of an employee, personal visits by such employee to a doctor, dentist or other medical practitioner, when approved by the administrative\nauthority, may be charged against accumulated sick leave credits. Proof of the\nneed for such visits, satisfactory to the administrative authority, may be\nrequired. (j) When an employee is\ntransferred or reassigned, the court or agency to which the employee is\ntransferred or reassigned shall credit the employee with all of his or her\naccumulated sick leave credits not used prior to such transfer or reassignment. When an employee is separated from service for other than disciplinary reasons\nand is subsequently reinstated or reemployed within one year after such\nseparation, or is reinstated by action of the Chief Administrator of the\n\nCourts, or is reinstated or reemployed while eligible for reinstatement from a\npreferred list, his or her sick leave credits accumulated and unused at the\ntime of his or her separation shall be restored; provided, however, that such\nsick leave credits shall not be restored except where leave records\nsatisfactory to the administrative authority are available. (k) Sick leave bank program. The Chief\n\nAdministrator or his or her designee may establish rules and procedures\npermitting an employee who has exhausted all of his or her sick leave, annual\nleave and overtime credits to draw sick leave credits from a sick leave bank\nestablished through the contribution of leave credits by employees who\nparticipate in the program.
