  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 664.5 - Classification System\n\nState Regulations\n\nNot all wetlands supply equally the benefits explained in\nsection\n664.3\n(b) of this\n\nPart. The degree to which wetlands supply benefits depends upon many factors, including: their rare species and biodiversity, their hydrological and\npollution control features, their cover types and special features, and their\ndistribution and location; and these may vary considerably from wetland to\nwetland. Because of this variation, the Act requires the commissioner to\nclassify wetlands in a way that recognizes that not all wetlands are of equal\nvalue. This section establishes four ranked regulatory classes of wetlands that\nare based upon the degree of benefits supplied, as identified or determined by\nthe department. (a) Class I wetlands. A wetland shall be a class I wetland if it has any of the following\ncharacteristics, as determined by the department: (1)\nit contains habitat that is utilized for\nan essential behavior of a species listed as endangered or threatened in Part\n182 of this Title or is listed as endangered or threatened by the United States\n\nDepartment of the Interior in the Code of Federal Regulations ( 50 CFR Part\n17\n); (2)\nit contains an endangered or\nthreatened plant species as listed in Part 193 of this Title; (3)\nit falls within a significant coastal\nfish and wildlife habitat area, designated as such by the Department of State\npursuant to Part 602 of Title 19 of the New York Code of Rules and\n\nRegulations; (4)\nit is a tidally\ninfluenced wetland not regulated by the department pursuant to article 25 of\nthe ECL; (5)\nit is contiguous to a\ntidally influenced wetland regulated under article 25 of the ECL; (6)\nit contains a wetland plant community\nidentified as critically imperiled; (7)\nit is a nutrient poor wetland; (8)\nit is in an area designated as a floodway\non the Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) or 'National Flood Hazard\n\nLayer', produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); or\n(9)\nit is contiguous to fresh\nsurface waters having classifications of A, AA, AA-S, AS, or N, as set forth in\n\nParts 800-941 of this Title. (b) Class II wetlands. A wetland shall be a\nclass II wetland if it has any of the following characteristics, as determined\nby the department: (1)\nit contains an\noccurrence of an animal species identified as critically imperiled or\nimperiled; (2)\nit contains habitat\nthat is utilized for an essential behavior of a species of special concern as\nlisted in Part 182 of this Title, or a species listed in the New York State\n\nWildlife Action Plan (Sept. 2015) as a 'high priority' species of greatest\nconservation need; (3)\nit contains\nan occurrence of a plant species identified as critically imperiled or\nimperiled; (4)\nit is a Great Lakes\n\nCoastal Wetland that is not part of a significant coastal fish and wildlife\nhabitat area; (5)\nit is a vernal\npool regulated pursuant to this Part; (6)\nit contains a wetland plant community\nidentified as imperiled; (7)\nit is\nlocated within a FEMA designated 100-year floodplain on the Digital Flood\n\nInsurance Rate Map (DFIRM) or 'National Flood Hazard Layer', produced by the\n\nFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA); (8)\nit is within the boundary of a sole\nsource aquifer as identified by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in\n'EPA Sole Source Aquifers' (August 2020); (9)\nit is contiguous to fresh surface waters\nhaving classifications of B as set forth in Parts 800-941 of this\n\nTitle; (10)\nit is contiguous to\nfresh surface waters assigned a standard of A(t), A(ts), AA(t), AA(ts), A-S(t), A-S(ts), AA-S(t), AA-S(ts), B(t), B(ts), C(t), or C(ts) as set forth in Parts\n800-941 of this Title; (11)\nit has\nall three wetland structural groups: woody, herbaceous, and open\nwater; (12)\nit consists of floating\nand/or submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and is not dominated (<= 50%) by\ninvasive species identified by the department pursuant to Part 575 of this\n\nTitle; (13)\nit is located wholly\nwithin, or is partially within, an urban area as defined and identified in the\n'2020 Census Qualifying Urban Areas and Final Criteria Clarifications By The\n\nUnited States Census Bureau' (December 2022); (14)\nthe wetland is located in, or is\npartially located in, an area identified as a disadvantaged community as\ndefined in the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) ECL\n75-0101(5); or\n(15)\nthe wetland is\nlocated wholly within, or is partially located within, an area identified as a\n\nPotential Environmental Justice Area as determined by the department.

(d) Class IV wetlands. A wetland shall be a\nclass IV wetland if it has any of the following enumerated characteristics, as\ndetermined by the department: (1)\nit is\ncontiguous to fresh surface waters having classifications of D as set forth in\n\nParts 800-941 of this Title; (2)\nit\nconsists of floating and/or submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) and is dominated\n(> 50%) by invasive species identified by the department pursuant to Part\n575 of this Title; or\n(3)\nit is an\nemergent marsh or wet meadow and is dominated (> 50%) by invasive species\nidentified by the department pursuant to Part 575. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n664.5\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 31, 2024/Volume XLVI, Issue 53, eff. 1/1/2025\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. Not all\nwetlands\nsupply equally the benefits explained in section\n664.3\n(b) of this Part. The degree to which\nwetlands\nsupply benefits depends upon many factors, including: their vegetative cover, their ecological associations, their special features, their hydrological and\npollution\ncontrol features, and their distribution and\nlocation; and these may vary considerably from\nwetland\nto\nwetland. Because of this variation, the\nact\nrequires the\ncommissioner\nto classify\nwetlands\nin a way that recognizes that not all\nwetlands\nare of equal value. This section establishes four ranked regulatory classes of\nwetlands, depending upon the degree of benefits supplied. The benefits cited in section 24-0105(7) of the\nact\nare translated into discernible\nwetland\ncharacteristics, and these characteristics are used to classify\nwetlands. Section\n664.6\nof this Part describes each characteristic in some detail and discusses the benefits supplied by a\nwetland\nwhen it contains that characteristic. (a) Class I\nwetlands. A\nwetland\nshall be a class I\nwetland\nif it has any of the following seven enumerated characteristics: Ecological Associations\n(1)\n\nIt is a\nclassic kettlehole bog\n(664.6[b][2]); [FN*]\nSpecial Features\n(2)\n\nIt is resident habitat of an endangered or threatened animal species (664.6 [c][2] and [4]); (3)\n\nIt contains an endangered or threatened plant species (664.6[c][4]); (4)\n\nIt supports an animal species in abundance or diversity unusual for the\n\nState\nor for the major region of the\n\nState\nin which it is found (664.6[c][1] and [6]); Hydrological and\n\nPollution\n\nControl Features\n(5)\n\nIt is tributary to a body of water which could subject a substantially developed area to significant damage from flooding or from additional flooding should the\nwetland\nbe modified, filled or drained (664.6[d][1]); (6)\n\nIt is adjacent or contiguous to a reservoir or other body of water that is used primarily for public water supply, or it is hydraulically connected to an aquifer which is used for public water supply (664.6[d][2],[3] and [4]); or\n\nOther\n(7)\n\nIt contains four or more of the enumerated class II characteristics. The\ndepartment\nmay, however, determine that some of the characteristics are duplicative of each other, therefore do not indicate enhanced benefits, and so do not warrant class I\nclassification. Each species to which paragraphs (b)(6)- (8) of this section apply shall be considered a separate class II characteristic for this purpose. (b) Class II\nwetlands. A\nwetland\nshall be a class II\nwetland\nif it has any of the following 17 enumerated characteristics: Cover Type\n(1)\n\nIt is an emergent marsh in which purple loosestrife and/or reed (phragmites) constitutes less than two thirds of the cover type (664.6[a][2]); [FN*]\nEcological Associations\n(2)\n\nIt contains two or more\nwetland\nstructural groups (664.6[b][1]); (3)\n\nIt is contiguous to a tidal\nwetland\n(664.6[b][3]); (4)\n\nIt is associated with permanent open water outside the\nwetland\n(664.6[b] [4]); (5)\n\nIt is adjacent or contiguous to streams classified C(t) or higher under article 15 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law\n(664.6[b][5]); Special Features\n(6)\n\nIt is traditional migration habitat of an endangered or threatened animal species (664.6[c][3] and [4]); (7)\n\nIt is resident habitat of an animal species vulnerable in the\n\nState\n(664.6 [c][2] and [5]); (8)\n\nIt contains a plant species vulnerable in the\n\nState\n(664.6[c][5]); (9)\n\nIt supports an animal species in abundance or diversity unusual for the county in which it is found (664.6[c][7]); (10)\n\nIt has demonstrable archaeological or paleontological significance as a\nwetland\n(664.6[c][8]); (11)\n\nIt contains, is part of, owes its existence to, or is ecologically associated with, an unusual geological feature which is an excellent representation of its type (664.6[c][9]); Hydrological and\n\nPollution\n\nControl Features\n(12)\n\nIt is tributary to a body of water which could subject a lightly developed area, an area used for growing crops for harvest, or an area planned for development by a local\nplanning\nauthority, to significant damage from flooding or from additional flooding should the\nwetland\nbe modified, filled or drained (664.6[d][1]); (13)\n\nIt is hydraulically connected to an aquifer which has been identified by a government agency as a potentially useful water supply (664.6[d][4]); (14)\n\nIt acts in a tertiary\ntreatment\ncapacity for a sewage\ndisposal\nsystem (664.6[d][3]); Distribution and\n\nLocation\n(15)\n\nIt is within an urbanized area (664.6[e][1]); (16)\n\nIt is one of the three largest\nwetlands\nwithin a city, town, or New York City borough (664.6[e][3]); or\n(17)\n\nIt is within a publicly owned recreation area (664.6[e][4]).
