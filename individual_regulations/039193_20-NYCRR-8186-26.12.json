  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-26.12 - Corrections to the survey data\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen an error specified in this section is discovered prior\nto completion of the survey it shall be corrected as provided herein. (a) Where a parcel, or part of a parcel, that\nshould have been excluded from the classified roll was erroneously included on\nthe classified roll, the parcel, or part of a parcel, shall be removed from the\ninterval to which it was assigned upon the written approval of ORPTS. In the\nevent that the number of required sampled parcels for the interval is greater\nthan the number of remaining parcels in the interval, the number of sampled\nparcels shall be set equal to the number of parcels remaining in the\ninterval. (b) If two contiguous\nparcels on the base year roll belonging to the same owner have both been\nselected as sample parcels, and it appears from the property record card, field\nbook, or other final work product of the assessor that there has been a\ntransposition of assessed values or roll identification for the two parcels, and the assessor confirms in writing that such transposition has occurred, the\nfollowing procedure is to be followed: (1)\n\nIf\nneither parcel is a large unit, substitute appraisals shall be used. (2)\n\nIf either of the parcels is a large unit, the assessed values and inventory quantities on the base year roll shall be\ntransposed but the roll identification maintained. (c) Where, through a clerical error by ORPTS, a parcel is included on the classified roll with an incorrect total assessed\nvalue, incorrect major type code or incorrect survey unit code, the following\nprocedure is to be followed using the corrected parcel data: (1)\n\nIf the parcel is a sample parcel and has\nbeen appraised, the parcel shall be a designated sample parcel and placed in an\ninterval containing only itself and remain in the sample. In the event that the\nnumber of required sample parcels for the original interval is greater than the\nnumber of parcels remaining in the original interval, the number of sample\nparcels shall be set equal to the number of parcels remaining in the original\ninterval. (2)\n\nIf the parcel is not\na sample parcel, the parcel shall be designated unsampled parcel and placed in\nan interval containing only itself and remain unsampled. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n8186-26.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
