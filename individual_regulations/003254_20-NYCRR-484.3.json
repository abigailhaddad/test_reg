(b) If the owner of a motor vehicle has\nobtained a permit and sticker therefor and leased or interchanged it during the\nreporting period to different carriers who operate the motor vehicle under the\nowner's permit, such motor vehicle must be reported by the owner in either of\nthe following ways: (1)\n\nIf the owner pays the\ntax, the motor vehicle should be reported on the tax return of the owner on\nform MT-903. (2)\n\nIf the lessee will\npay the tax, the owner should file form MT-903 accompanies by form TMT-4. Form\nMT-903 will be filled in only to the extent of the heading and the\ncertification. Form TMT-4 will list the permit number of each vehicle, the\nunloaded and maximum gross weights indicated on such permit, the name and\naddress of the lessee, and such other information as may be required. The\nlessee must report such vehicle on his own tax return. (c) If the owner of a motor vehicle has\nobtained a permit and sticker therefor and it is subsequently leased to a\nlessee who obtains a permit, the owner should list such motor vehicle on form\nMT-903 with a notation, \"Leased to and reported under permit number of (name of\nlessee)\". The lessee will account for such vehicle under his own permit number. Should the owner wish to relieve himself of the responsibility of reporting\nsuch motor vehicle on each tax return, he may do so by surrendering his permit\nto the Miscellaneous Tax Bureau for cancellation and by destroying the\nsticker. (d) A lessee of a motor\nvehicle who has obtained a permit therefor must include said motor vehicle on\nhis tax return until he surrenders the permit and plate. (e) Carriers interchanging or leasing\nequipment are required to give each other the necessary mileage information and\nthe unloaded and maximum gross weight of the vehicle involved. Example:Permits for Tractor A and Trailer B have been\nissued to Smith Truck Company, which operates Tractor A and Trailer B from\n\nAlbany to Poughkeepsie, where Trailer B is interchanged with Trailer C (for\nwhich a permit has been issued to Jones Transportation Company). Tractor A and\n\nTrailer C continue on to New York City, and Trailer B and Tractor D return to\n\nAlbany. (The permit for Tractor D has been issued to Jones Company.)\n\nExample:Smith Truck Company must file a tax return\nreporting on the mileage of Tractor A and Trailer B from Albany to Poughkeepsie\nand on Tractor A and Trailer C from Poughkeepsie to New York City. Smith Truck\n\nCompany may also include in its return, the mileage of Tractor D and Trailer B\nfrom Poughkeepsie to Albany, or it may file from TMT-4 indicating that Trailer\nB was interchanged with Jones Transportation Company. Example:If Smith Truck Company files form TMT-4, Jones\n\nTransportation Company must report on the mileage of Tractor D and Trailer B. Jones Transportation Company must also file form TMT-4 indicating that Trailer\nC was interchanged with Smith Truck Company. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
