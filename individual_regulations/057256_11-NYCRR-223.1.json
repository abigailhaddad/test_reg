  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 223.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part sets forth standards to protect active-duty service members of the United States Armed Forces from dishonest and predatory insurance sales practices, by identifying and prohibiting certain acts that constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts and practices in the conduct of the business of insurance in this State, or are trade practices constituting determined violations, as defined in Insurance Law, section 2402(c), in violation of Insurance Law, section 2403. T his Part also effectuates the Federal Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act, Pub. L. No. 109-290\n(2006), which was signed by the president on September 29, 2006. This Part is intended to be consistent, to the greatest extent practicable, with the model regulation adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners on June 4, 2007. While addressing specific acts and practices with respect to the sale of insurance to active-duty service members, nothing herein shall be construed as permitting acts or practices that are otherwise prohibited under other laws or regulations of this State. (b) Nothing herein shall be construed to create or imply a private cause of action for violation of this Part, or implying that similar conduct in non-military sales circumstances would be otherwise permissible. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n223.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
