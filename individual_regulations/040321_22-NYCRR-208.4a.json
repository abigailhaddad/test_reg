(2)\n\nCommencing an action by electronic means. (i) Except as otherwise provided in\nsubdivision (a) of this section, a party may commence any action in the Civil\n\nCourt in any county (provided that e-filing has been authorized in that county\nand in the class of actions to which that action belongs pursuant to\nsubdivision (a) of this section) by electronically filing the initiating\ndocuments with the clerk of the court through the NYSCEF site. (ii)\n\nDocuments that are electronically filed\nto commence an action in compliance with this section shall be deemed filed\nwith the Clerk of the Civil Court in the county in which the action is brought\nfor purposes of section\n400\nof the New York City Civil Court Act\nupon the date of receipt of those documents by the NYSCEF site, together with\nthe payment of any required fee.

The notice shall contain a\nlink to a copy of the initiating documents to which shall be affixed an index\nnumber for the matter and a filing stamp showing the date of filing of the\ndocuments and to which there may also be affixed, as the court may require, an\nimage of the signature of the Chief Clerk. This notice will satisfy the\nrequirement in section\n400\n(1)\nof the New York City Civil Court Act that\nthe clerk return a copy of the filing to the party. (iv)\n\nWhere a summary proceeding under Article\n7 of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law involving residential\nproperty is commenced electronically, NYSCEF shall provide the petitioner with\nthe option, in lieu of submitting a stamped postcard containing the written\nnotice required by section\n208.42\n(i) of\nthese rules, of having the clerk of the court mail such notice to the\nrespondent or, if there be more than one respondent, to all of them.
