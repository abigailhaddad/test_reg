Codes R. & Regs. tit. 10, APPENDICES, app 5-D, tbl. 1 - Required Minimum Separation Distances to Protect Public Water Supply Wells From Contamination\n\nState Regulations\n\nContaminant Source\n\nDistance (Feet)\n1\n\nChemical storage sites not protected from the elements (e.g., salt and sand/salt storage)\n2\n300\n\nLandfill waste disposal area, or hazardous or radiological waste disposal area\n2\n300\n\nLand surface application or subsurface injection of effluent or digested sludge from a municipal or public wastewater treatment facility\n300\n\nLand surface application or subsurface injection of septage waste\n300\n\nLand surface spreading or subsurface injection of liquid or solid manure\n3\n200\n\nStorage areas for manure piles\n3\n200\n\nBarnyard, silo, barn gutters and animal pens\n3\n200\n\nCesspools (i.e., pits with no septic tank pretreatment)\n200\n\nWastewater treatment absorption systems located in coarse gravel or in the direct path of drainage to a well\n200\n\nFertilizer and/or pesticide mixing and/or clean up areas\n200\n\nSeepage pit (following septic tank)\n200\n\nUnderground single walled chemical or petroleum storage vessels\n200\n\nAbsorption field or bed\n200\n\nContained chemical storage sites protected from the elements (e.g., salt and sand/salt storage within covered structures)\n4\n200\n\nSeptic system components (non-watertight)\n200\n\nIntermittent sand filter without a watertight liner\n200\n\nSanitary privy pit\n200\n\nSurface wastewater recharge absorption system for storm water from parking lots, roadways or driveways\n200\n\nCemeteries\n200\n\nSanitary privy with a watertight vault\n200\n\nSeptic tank, aerobic unit, watertight effluent line to distribution box\n100\n\nSanitary sewer or combined sewer\n50\n\nSurface water recharge absorption system with no automotive-related wastes (e.g., clear-water basin, clear-water dry well)\n\nNone\n5\n\nStream, lake, watercourse, drainage ditch, or wetland\n\nNone\n5\n\nAll known sources of contamination otherwise not shown above\n200\n\nNotes for Table 1: 1\n\nThe listed water well separation distances from contaminant sources shall be increased by 50% whenever aquifer water enters the water well at less than 50 feet below grade. If a 50% increase in separation distances can not be achieved, then the greatest possible increase in separation distance shall be provided with such additional measures as needed to prevent contamination. 2\n\nWater wells shall not be located in a direct line of flow from these items, nor in any contaminant plume created by these items, except with such additional measures (e.g., sentinel groundwater monitoring, hydraulic containment, source water treatment) as needed to prevent contamination. 3\n\nWater wells may be located 100 feet from temporary (30 days or less) manure piles/staging areas that are controlled to preclude contamination of surface or groundwater or 100 feet from otherwise managed manure piles that are controlled pursuant to regulation in a manner that prevents contamination of surface or groundwater. Wells serving public water systems may be located 100 feet from temporary barnyards, silos, barn gutters, or animal pens that are similarly controlled to prevent contamination of surface or groundwater. 4\n\nChemical storage sites as used in this entry do not include properly maintained storage areas of chemicals used for water treatment. 5\n\nWells serving public water systems may be located near water bodies or surface water recharge systems but are subject to monitoring to determine if groundwater at the point of withdrawal is directly influenced by surface water and corresponding treatment requirements. Such wells must also be protected from floodwater pursuant to subdivision 5-B.2(b) of this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 10, APPENDICES, app 5-D, tbl. 1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
