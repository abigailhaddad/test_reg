  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 621.14 - Special provisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any time period specified\nin this Part may be extended for good cause, by mutual written consent of the\napplicant and the department. The EPA must be notified in those cases where a\nproposed extension will exceed the time periods established in Federal\nregulation. This provision does not supersede the requirement that the public\ncan request judicial review in State court if a title V permit is not issued\nwithin 18 months of the date that an application is complete. (b) At any time during the review of an\napplication for a new permit, modification, or renewal, the department may\nrequest in writing any additional information which is reasonably necessary to\nmake any findings or determinations required by law. Such a request must be\nexplicit and must indicate the reasonable date by which the department is to\nreceive the information. Failure to provide such information by the date\nspecified in the request may be grounds for permit denial. (c) The department may issue general permits\nto allow work to eliminate damage caused by natural disasters or extraordinary\nweather not unique to a particular locality, including repair or replacement in\nlocation and in kind of facilities which existed prior to the damage. Processing of such permits need not follow the full procedural requirements of\nthis Part. (d) General permits may\nalso be issued by the department for projects that are determined not to have a\nsignificant impact on the environment under SEQR, and that have been subjected\nto the full procedural requirements of this Part for major projects. General\npermits under the SPDES program and the air pollution control program in\naccordance with Part 201 of this Title may be issued for regulated activities\nfor which the department determines that all the requirements of this\nsubdivision have been met. (e) The\ndepartment may require as a condition to a permit, and prior to commencement of\nwork, that the permittee post a bond or other financial assurance acceptable to\nthe department of specified amount with the department. This is to ensure\nfaithful compliance with the terms of the permit and is used for the\nindemnification of the State for any costs which might result from failure to\nso comply. The bond or other financial assurance shall remain in effect until\nthe work is completed to the satisfaction of the department. (f) Where this Part requires exchange of\nwritten materials within specified time periods, postmark dates shall satisfy\nthe requirements, when not otherwise specifically provided. (g) Pursuant to Article 3 of the State\n\nTechnology Law, the Electronic Records and Signatures Act, documents required\nunder this Part may be transmitted and received by electronic means. For\npurposes of this Part, the receipt date of an electronic record shall be the\ndate received on any business day from midnight to 4:45 p.m., or the next\nbusiness day if received any other time. Where written materials are specified\nin this Part, an electronic record may be considered the equivalent of a\nwritten record. (h) The department\nmay issue a research, development, and demonstration permit, where program\nregulations provide for such consideration, for any facility which proposes to\nutilize an innovative and experimental technology or process for which permit\nstandards have not been promulgated. This permit must include terms and\nconditions to assure protection of human health and the environment. Research, development, and demonstration permits are subject to the following provisions: (1)\n\nVariances from permit application and\nissuance requirements of this Part may be granted by the department, except\nthere may be no variance from any provisions requiring public\nparticipation. (2)\n\nSuch permits may\nbe issued for a period not to exceed one year and may not be renewed more than\nthree times, with each renewal period not to exceed one year. Experimental\npermits may be revoked when it is determined by the department to be necessary\nto protect human health and the environment. (3)\n\nThese permit applications are subject to\nall other procedural requirements of this Part. (i) Applications treated as new pursuant to\nthis Part shall be subject to the review procedures of this Part, including\ndeterminations of completeness, determinations whether to conduct a hearing, and any other provisions applicable to new applications. Applications treated\nas new will be considered major, unless specifically listed or described as\nminor under this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
