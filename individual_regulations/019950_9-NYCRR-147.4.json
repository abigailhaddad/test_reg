  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 147.4 - Performance advances\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Eligibility. Annual salaried employees, whose basic annual salary is below the\njob rate for their positions and whose performance has been rated higher than\n\"Unsatisfactory\" or its equivalent during the preceding evaluation period are\neligible to receive performance advances. Employees whose positions are\nunallocated but are equated to salary grades (other than grade M-8) by the\n\nDirector of the Budget shall be eligible for performance advances as if\nallocated to the equated grade. (b) Method of payment. Performance advances shall become effective on the first day\nof the first payroll period beginning on or after July 1st, except that\nadvances for education directors paid over 10 months shall become effective\n\nSeptember 1st. (c) Performance\nadvance amounts. Each agency will be assigned a performance advance amount\nwhich will be the maximum aggregate increase to base salaries of eligible\nemployees that may be granted as a result of performance advances. Performance\nadvance amounts will be based on the actual number, salaries and grades of\neligible employees in each agency and will be assigned by the Director of the\n\nBudget. Performance advance amounts may be assigned on a facility or payroll\ncode basis as appropriate. (d) Individual employee payments. An agency's performance advance amount will be\ndistributed to eligible employees based upon the actual distribution of\nratings. However, where the number of eligible employees is insufficient to\nenable a proportional distribution of payments, an appropriate rating\ndistribution will be constructed, based on experience. Employees rated \"Needs\n\nImprovement\" or its equivalent will receive an amount equal to one sixth of\ntheir job range; employees rated \"Effective,\" \"Highly Effective\" or their\nequivalent will receive one fourth of their job range; and employees rated\n\"Outstanding\" or its equivalent will receive up to one third of their job\nrange, depending on the percentage of employees rated \"Outstanding\" or its\nequivalent. Employees rated \"Unsatisfactory\" or its equivalent will not receive\nadvances. In any case, however, where a performance advance payment would\nresult in a basic annual salary above the job rate for the employee's\npositions, only that portion of the advance which would bring the employee's\nsalary up to the job rate shall be paid. (e) Reconstructed promotion salaries. Employees who are promoted or appointed to a higher salary grade during the\nevaluation period who are otherwise eligible for an advance shall receive a\npartial advance prorated on the number of pay periods the employee has served\nin the higher grade as described in section\n147.3\n(b) of this\n\nPart. In addition, at the end of the evaluation period if the employee would\nhave been eligible for an advance in the lower grade, the salary upon promotion\nshall be reconstructed by applying a prorated advance amount based on number of\npay periods served in the lower grade as described in section\n147.3\n(b). However, an employee with 24 or more pay periods of creditable service in both grades\nduring the evaluation period shall receive credits for a full advance; the\nadvance in the higher grade shall be prorated as described in section\n147.3\n(b), while\nthe balance shall be applied to reconstruction of the salary upon promotion. Any advance based on the higher grade shall be added to this reconstructed\nsalary. In each case the performance advance amount used shall be 25 percent of\nthe salary range. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n147.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
