(2)\n\nThe commander\nauthorized to impose non-judicial punishment in a given action must terminate\nthe action without imposing punishment if no punishable offense has been proven\nto his satisfaction. (i) Once the action is\nterminated without the imposition of punishment, the commander must, in\naccordance with the provisions of section\n520.3\n(a)(3)\nof this Part, mail or deliver written notification of the termination of the\naction without imposition of punishment to: (a) the individual formerly\naccused; (b) any person who\nrecommended the imposition of non-judicial punishment of the individual for the\n(unsatisfactorily proven) offense; and\n(c) all immediate and intermediate commanders\nof the individual. (ii)\n\nThe notification shall include the order to forthwith expunge from the\nindividual's records all references to the alleged commission of the offense by\nthe individual and to the commencement of the non-judicial punishment action, and the commander shall place the notification in the individual's field\npersonnel record. (iii)\n\nThe effect\nof such order to terminate and expunge is to fully restore the individual to\nthe status he was in before the alleged commission of the offense. (iv)\n\nNo separate orders to expunge need be\npublished, but the commander and the unit JA should maintain a record of the\ncorrespondence which terminated the action and expunged all references to the\naction from the individual's record. (v) Although the unit JA is not required to\nreview such a termination action for legal sufficiency, it is recommended the\ncommander consult with his JA before terminating the action. (vi)\n\nThis commander's decision to terminate\nthe action and expunge is final, not reviewable, nor will it be sent to HQ\nNYANG. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
