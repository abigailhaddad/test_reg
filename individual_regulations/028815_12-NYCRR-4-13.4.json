  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 4-13.4 - Setting and installation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Wet-bottom boilers. Boilers of the wet-bottom type having an external width\nof over 36 inches shall have not less than 12 inches between the bottom of the\nboiler and floor line, with access for inspection. When the width is 36 inches\nor less, the distance between the bottom of the boiler and the floor line shall\nbe not less than six inches, and when any part of the wet bottom is not farther\nfrom an outer edge than 12 inches it shall be not less than four inches. If\nhandholes are located in the bottom area of the boiler, the bottom clearance\nfor the boiler shall be not less than 12 inches regardless of width. (b) Access doors. The minimum size of access doors used in a boiler setting\nshall be 12 inches by 16 inches, or equivalent area of which the least\ndimension is 11 inches. (c) Expansion and contraction. Provision shall be made for the expansion and contraction\nof steam mains connected to boilers by providing substantial anchorage at\nsuitable points, so that there shall be no undue strain transmitted to the\nboiler. (d) Feedwater. Feedwater or makeup water shall not be discharged\ndirectly into any part of a boiler exposed to the direct radiant heat from the\nfire. Feedwater shall not be introduced through the openings or connections\nused for the relief valve, the water column, or the water gage glass. (e) Heaters. A heater for oil or other liquid harmful to boiler\noperations shall not be installed directly in the steam or water space within a\nboiler. Where an external-type heater for such service is used, means shall be\nprovided to prevent the introduction into the boiler of oil or other liquid\nharmful to boiler operation. (f) Fluid-relief columns. All hot water heating systems shall be so installed that\nthere will be no opportunity for the fluid-relief column to freeze or to be\naccidentally shut off. (g) Expansion tanks. If the system is equipped with an open expansion tank, an\nindoor overflow from the upper portion of the expansion tank shall be provided\nin addition to an open vent, the indoor flow to be carried within the building\nto a suitable plumbing fixture or to the basement. If the system is of the\nclosed type, an airtight tank or other suitable air cushion shall be installed\nthat will be consistent with the volume and capacity of the system. Provision\nshall be made for draining the tank without emptying the system. (h) Return pipe stop\nvalves. When a stop valve is used in the supply pipe connection\nof a single boiler, there shall be one used in the return pipe connection\nunless a proper return loop is provided. (i) Stop valve requirements. A stop valve shall be used in each supply and return pipe\nconnection of two or more boilers connected to a common system. Provision shall\nbe made for cleaning the interior of the return piping at or close to the\nboiler. When stop valves over two inches in size are used, they shall be of the\noutside-screw-and-yoke rising-spindle type or of such type as to indicate at a\ndistance by the position of the spindle or other operating mechanism whether it\nis closed or open, and the wheel may be carried either on the yoke or attached\nto the spindle. If the valve is of the plug cock type, it must be fitted with a\nslow-opening mechanism and an indicating device, and the plug must be held in\nplace by a guard or gland. (j) Stop valve identification. When stop valves are used, they shall be properly\ndesignated substantially as indicated by the following tags of metal or other\ndurable material fastened to them: Supply Valve-Number ()\n\nReturn Valve-Number ()\n\nDo Not Close Without Also\n\nDo Not Close Without Also\n\nClosing Return Valve-\nClosing Supply Valve-\nNumber ()\n\nNumber ()\n(k) Connections for safety\nvalves. The area of the opening shall be at least equal to the\naggregate area based on the nominal diameters of all of the safety valves with\nwhich it connects. A screwed connection may be used for attaching a safety\nvalve. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n4-13.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
