  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 202.23 - Staggered Court Appearances\n\nState Regulations\n\nStaggered court appearances are a mechanism to increase\nefficiency in the courts and to decrease lawyers' time waiting for a matter to\nbe called by the courts. While this rule is intended to streamline the\nlitigation process, it will be ineffectual without the cooperation and\nparticipation of litigants. Improving the process of litigation by instituting\nstaggered court appearances, for example, requires not only the promulgation of\nrules such as this one, but also, and more importantly, the proactive and\nearnest adherence to such rules by parties and their counsel and the\ncourt. (a) Each court appearance for\noral argument on a motion shall be assigned either a set time or a time\ninterval during which the appearance is expected to be held. The assignment of\ntime or time interval, and the length of time allotted to a case is solely in\nthe discretion of the court. (b) In\norder for the court to be able to address any and all matters of concern to the\ncourt and in order for the court to avoid the appearance of holding ex parte\ncommunications with one or more parties in the case, even those parties who\nbelieve that they are not directly involved in the matter before the court must\nappear at the appointed date and time assigned by the court unless specifically\nexcused by the court. (c) Since the\ncourt is setting aside a specific time or time interval for the case and since\nthere are occasions when the court's electronic or other notification system\nfails or occasions when a party fails to receive the court-generated\nnotification, each attorney who receives notification of an appearance on a\nspecific date and time is responsible for notifying all other parties by e-mail\nthat the matter is scheduled to be heard on that assigned date and time. All\nparties are directed to exchange e-mail addresses with each other at the\ncommencement of the case and to keep these e-mail addresses current, in order\nto facilitate notification by the person(s) receiving the court\nnotification. (d) Requests for\nadjournments shall be transmitted in writing to the court and to all parties, in such manner as the court may direct, so as to be received no later than 48\nhours before the hearing and shall set forth whether the other parties consent\nto the adjournment.
