  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 80-8.5 - Conditioning\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Standard\nconditions for testing. Flame tests shall be performed under or upon immediate\nremoval from standard atmospheric conditions and on specimens in moisture\nequilibrium under standard atmospheric conditions. (b) Preconditioning. In the event of dispute\nconcerning the results of tests that may be affected by the moisture content, the material shall be preconditioned by being brought to moisture equilibrium\nwith an atmosphere having a relative humidity of not over 10 percent and a\ntemperature not over 125° F. (52° C.). The material shall then be\nbrought to moisture equilibrium under standard atmospheric conditions and then\ntested. (c) Leaching. Tests in\nsections 80-8.6 and\n80-8.7\nof this Subpart shall be\nperformed both before and after leaching. (1)\n\nTest specimen. Test specimens to be leached shall be of the following\ndimensions: (i) Each flooring material test\nspecimen shall be a 9 inch by 9 inch (+-1/16 inch) section of the flooring\nmaterial to be tested. (ii)\n\nWall\nand top material test specimens shall be rectangles of cloth 2 3/4 inches by 12\ninches. (+- 1/16 inch) with the long dimensions parallel to either the warp or\nfilling directions of the material. (2)\n\nApparatus. The following apparatus shall\nbe used in the leaching process. (i) Water\ncontainer or tank of such shape and size that the specimen can be submerged\ntherein with all surfaces of the specimen having full access to the water. For\ncloth specimens the container shall allow not less than 1/2 gallon of water for\neach square foot of specimen. The water shall be changed by a continuous flow\nor by emptying and refilling so that there shall be at least six complete\nchanges of water in a 72-hour period. (ii)\n\nMeans of maintaining water at a\ntemperature of 60° F. to 70° F. (15.5° C. to 21.1° C.) and a pH\nof 6.0 to 8.0 during the test. (iii)\n\nMeans for holding the specimen\nsubmerged throughout the leaching period. (3)\n\nProcedure. The specimens shall be\nimmersed in water at a temperature of 60° F. to 70° F. (15.5° C. to\n21.1° C.) and a pH of 6.0 to 8.0 for 72 hours. The specimen shall then be\nremoved, air-dried, and brought to standard atmospheric conditions prior to\nfurther testing. (d) Accelerated weathering. Tests in sections 80-8.6 and\n80-8.7\nshall be performed both\nbefore and after accelerated weathering. (1)\n\nTest specimen. Test specimens to be weathered shall be of the following\ndimensions: (i) Each flooring material test\nspecimen shall be a 9 inch by 9 inch (+-1/16 inch) section of the flooring\nmaterial to be tested. (ii)\n\nWall\nand top material test specimens shall be rectangles of cloth 2 3/4 inches by 12\ninches (+-1/16 inch) with the long dimensions parallel to either the warp or\nfilling directions of the material. (2)\n\nApparatus. The following apparatus shall\nbe used in the accelerated weathering process: (i) Vertical carbon arc mounted at the center\nor a vertical cylinder. The arc shall be designed to accommodate either two or\nthree pairs of carbons but shall burn only one pair at a time, automatically\ntransferring from one pair to another as the carbons are consumed. The carbons\nshall be sunshine-cored and copper-coated, No. 22 for the upper pair and 13 for\nthe lower pair. The arc shall be operated on 60 amperes and 50 volts across the\narc for alternating current and on 50 amperes and 60 volts across the arc for\ndirect current. (ii)\nA rotating\nrack with holder in which the specimens are suspended vertically and normally\nto radiation from the arc with the center of the face of the specimen at a\nradial distance of approximately 18 inches from the arc. (iii)\n\nWater-spray nozzles shall be mounted\nhorizontally (the water-spray assembly vertically) in the test chamber inside\nthe specimen rack and so placed that the water shall strike the specimens\nevenly over their entire length in the form of a fine spray in sufficient\nvolume to cover specimens immediately on impact. The apparatus shall be so\noperated that the specimens are exposed to successive cycles of 102 minutes of\nlight without spray and 18 minutes of light with spray. (iv)\n\nMeans for maintaining the required\ntemperature of water in the spray. (v) Means of maintaining the required\npressure of water entering the spray. (vi)\n\nMeans for delivering the required\nquantity of water per spray nozzle to the specimen. (vii)\n\nExhaust fan to ventilate the arc\neffectively. (viii)\n\nBlack panel\nthermometer unit for measuring the temperature within the machine. This unit\nshall consist of a metal panel to the base of which is attached the sensitive\nportion of a bimetallic dia-type thermometer. The entire base is then coated\ntwice with long lasting baked enamel paint. (3)\n\nProcedure. The following procedure shall\nbe followed: (i) The rack shall rotate about\nthe arc at a uniform speed of one revolution per minute. (ii)\n\nThe temperature of water in the spray\nshall be 80° +- 10° F. (26.7° +- 5.6° C). (iii)\n\nThe pressure of the water entering the\nspray shall be 1-18 psi inclusive. (iv)\n\nThe quantity of water delivered to the\nspecimen shall be.12 to.25 gallons, inclusive, per hour per spray\nnozzel. (v) The black panel\ntemperature at the exposure plane of the specimen rack shall be 155°\n+-10° F. (68° +- 5.7° C.) When measured in the following manner: (a) Before reading the temperature, the\nmachine shall be full of specimens and shall be in operation long enough for\nthermal equilibrium to be established. The black panel shall be mounted in the\ntest-panel rack and readings taken at the point where water spray is not\nstriking the panel. (vi)\n\nThe specimen shall be suspended on the rotating rack without tension and in\nsuch a way that the ends or corners cannot curl. The long dimension of the\nspecimen shall be in the vertical position and shall be indicated on the\nreverse side of the cloth. No test portion of the specimen shall be over seven\ninches above or below the horizontal plane of the arc. (vii)\n\nThe specimen shall be exposed to normal\nradiation from the arc for 100 hours. (viii)\n\nAt the end of the exposure period, the\nspecimen shall be removed from the machine, allowed to dry, and brought to\nstandard atmospheric conditions prior to further testing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n80-8.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
