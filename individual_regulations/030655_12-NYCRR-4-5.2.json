  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 4-5.2 - Safety valves for low pressure steam boilers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Capacity. A low pressure steam boiler\nshall include a safety valve or valves of a capacity such that with the heat\ngenerating equipment operating at maximum, the steam pressure shall not rise\nmore than five psi gage above the maximum allowable working pressure with all\nvalves open. If the minimum valve capacity in pounds per hour is calculated it\nshall be determined by dividing by 1,000 the maximum Btu output at the boiler\nnozzle obtainable from the heat generating equipment, or by multiplying the\nsquare feet of heating surface by the values given in the following table: Minimum pounds of steam per hour per square foot of\nsurface\n[Note: The following TABLE/FORM is too wide to be\ndisplayed on one screen. You must print it for a meaningful review of its\ncontents. The table has been divided into multiple pieces with each piece\ncontaining information to help you assemble a printout of the table. The\ninformation for each piece includes: (1) a three line message preceding the\ntabular data showing by line # and character # the position of the upper\nleft-hand corner of the piece and the position of the piece within the entire\ntable; and (2) a numeric scale following the tabular data displaying the\ncharacter positions.]\n*******************************************************************************\n******** This is piece 1. -- It begins at character 1 of table line 1. ********\n*******************************************************************************\nBoiled heating surface Hand-fired Stoker-fired Oil, gas, or Hand-fired\npulverized-fuel-fired Fire-tube 5 7 8 8 boilers Water-tube 6 8 10 8 boilers\n1...+...10....+...20....+...30....+...40....+...50....+...60....+...70....+. *******************************************************************************\n******* This is piece 2. -- It begins at character 77 of table line 1. ********\n*******************************************************************************\nWaterwall surface Stoker-fired Oil, gas, or pulverized-fuel-fired 10 14 12 16\n77......+...90....+....0....+...10.... Note: When a boiler is fired only by a gas having a heat\nvalue not in excess of 200 Btu per cubic foot, the minimum safety valve\nrelieving capacity may be based on the values given for hand-fired boilers\nabove. The minimum capacity of the valve or valves shall be\ngoverned by the capacity marking on the boiler. (b) Increased capacity. When operating\nconditions are changed or additional boiler heating surfaces installed, the\nvalve capacity shall be checked and increased if necessary to meet the new\nconditions. Necessary additional valves may be installed on the outlet piping, providing there is no intervening valve nor any other branching pipes between\nthe additional valves and the boiler. (c) Accumulation test. If the total capacity\nof safety valves is not otherwise ascertained they shall be subjected to an\naccumulation test. (d) Type. Required safety valves shall be of the spring-pop type, adjusted and sealed to\ndischarge at a pressure not to exceed 15 psi gage. The seats and disks shall be\nof suitable material to resist corrosion. (e) Size. No safety valve for a low pressure\nsteam heating boiler shall be smaller than 3/4 inch except in case the boiler\nand radiating surfaces are a self-contained unit. No safety valve shall be\nlarger than 41/2inches. The inlet opening shall have an inside diameter equal\nto or greater than the seat diameter. (f) Lifting device. Each safety valve for a\nlow pressure steam heating boiler shall have a substantial device which will\npositively lift the disk from its seat at least 1/16 inch when there is no\npressure on the boiler. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n4-5.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
