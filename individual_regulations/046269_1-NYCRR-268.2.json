  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 268.2 - Definition\n\nState Regulations\n\nTamper-evident packaging shall mean packaging having an\nindicator or barrier to entry which, if breached or missing, can reasonably be\nexpected to provide visible evidence to consumers that tampering has occurred. If a breached or missing indicator or barrier would not, in and of itself, provide consumers with such evidence, the packaging may still qualify as\ntamper-evident if, in conjunction with such device, a printed statement is\nprominently displayed on the product label so as to alert the consumer of the\noriginal presence of the indicator or barrier. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n268.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
