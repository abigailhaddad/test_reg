  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 232-2.4 - Equipment standards and specifications\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Specific equipment standards and emission\ncontrol specifications: (1)\n\nVapor barrier\nrooms. All co-located commercial and residential perc dry cleaning facilities\nmust be equipped with a vapor barrier room. Vapor barrier rooms must, at a\nminimum, enclose the perc dry cleaning equipment. They must be constructed of\npolyvinyl chloride, PVC sheet 22 mil thick (0.022 in.), sheet metal, metal foil\nfaced composite board, or other equivalent materials that are impermeable to\nperc vapors. All joints, seams and penetrations of the vapor barrier room must\nbe sealed except for entry doors and outside air inlet and exhaust vents. Entry\ndoors may only be open when a person is entering or exiting the room\nenclosure. (2)\n\nVapor barrier room\nventilation. Vapor barrier rooms must be equipped with a general exhaust\nventilation system that is completely separate from the ventilation system(s)\nserving other areas of the building. The general exhaust ventilation system\nmust be located near the dry cleaning machinery and in the vapor barrier room\nor connected to a separate room that exhausts the perc vapor emissions to the\noutside air. This dry cleaning general exhaust ventilation system must be\noperated at all times the facility is open for business and be capable of at\nleast one air change every five minutes. (3)\n\nExternal door fans. All third generation\nperc dry cleaning machines must be equipped with an external door fan. Fourth\ngeneration perc dry cleaning machines may only be equipped with an external\ndoor fan if installed prior to the effective date of this Subpart. External\ndoor fans must meet the following requirements: (i) External door fans must include a\nmechanical exhaust fan that is activated when the loading door is open; drawing\nroom air from outside the loading door, through the machine drum and a carbon\nadsorber prior to venting outside the building. A minimum inward air velocity\nof 100 feet per minute must be maintained through the effective door opening\narea of the loading door of the machine. (ii)\n\nExternal door fans must not recirculate\nvapors into the workroom and must be properly vented to the outside\nair. (iii)\n\nExternal door fans must\nbe controlled to a design perc emission standard of five ppm and an in-use\nmaximum perc compliance standard of 20 ppm. (4)\n\nPrimary emission control systems. Refrigerated condensers must: (i) be equipped\nwith temperature or pressure gauges to monitor performance and demonstrate\ncompliance of the refrigerated condenser; (a) where temperature gauges are installed to demonstrate compliance, the outlet\nvapor temperature must be less than or equal to 45° F (7.2° C) during the final\ncool-down phase and lower the temperature of the air-perc vapor stream entering\nand exiting the refrigerated condenser by at least 20° F (11.1° C). Temperature\nmust be measured with a graduated thermometer, thermocouple or equivalent\ninstrument, with a minimum range from 0° F (-18° C) to 150° F (66° C) and\naccuracy of ±2 °F (±1.1 °C), that measures the temperature of the outlet vapor\nstream and is easily visible to the operator; or\n(b) where pressure gauges are installed to\ndemonstrate compliance, the refrigerant high and low vapor pressures must be in\nthe range specified in the manufacturer's operating instructions during the\nheated and cool-down phases of the drying cycle; (ii)\nreduce the perc vapor concentration in\nthe drum to 8600 ppm or less upon completion of the cool-down phase; (iii)\nbe equipped with a drying\nsensor/controller that extends the drying time at least four minutes beyond the\npoint where the perc recovery rate is less than 40 ml/min, or the perc vapor\nconcentration in the drum is less than 8,600 ppm, on third and fourth\ngeneration machines installed on or after May 15, 1997; and\n(iv)\nbe operated with a diverter valve where\nan external door fan has been installed. (5)\n\nSecondary control systems. Integral\ncarbon adsorbers must: (i) be designed to\nfunction in conjunction with a compliant primary control system; (ii)\nreduce the perc vapor concentration in\nthe drum to 500 ppm or less at the immediate completion of the drying cycle and\nprior to the activation of any fugitive emissions control system on the\nfollowing dry cleaning machines without an external door fan: (a) fourth generation machines installed on\nor before September 22, 1993 at major dry cleaning facilities; (b) fourth generation machines installed\nbefore May 15, 1997 at non-major dry cleaning facilities; and\n(iii)\nreduce the perc\nvapor concentration in the drum to 300 ppm or less at the immediate completion\nof the drying cycle and prior to the activation of any fugitive emissions\ncontrol system on the following dry cleaning machines: (a) fourth generation machines installed\nafter September 22, 1993 at major dry cleaning facilities; (b) fourth generation machines, installed on\nor after May 15, 1997, that are not equipped with an external door fan at\nnon-major dry cleaning facilities; and\n(iv)\nbe designed for non-contact steam, or\nhot air stripping, and must be stripped or desorbed, at least weekly and, in\naccordance with manufacturer's instructions. (b) Perc dry cleaning machines. (1)\n\nNew machine requirements. Only new\ncompliant fourth generation perc dry cleaning machines that belong to equipment\nmodels previously certified by the department, or which have been issued a\nmanufacturer's Statement of Compliance, may be installed and thereafter\noperated at stand-alone and co-located commercial facilities. No used, converted or retrofitted equipment may be installed. (2)\n\nExisting machine requirements. Compliant\nperc dry cleaning machines and external door fans listed in paragraphs (2)(i)\nor (2)(ii) of this subdivision may be operated at the specified locations\nunless future operation is prohibited under section\n232-2.3\nof this Subpart. (i) Third generation perc dry cleaning\nmachines that meet the control requirements of section\n232-2.4\n(a)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart and were retrofitted with an external door fan that meets the\nrequirements of section\n232-2.4\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart, may be operated at existing dry cleaning facilities. (ii)\n\nFourth generation perc dry cleaning\nmachines with primary and secondary control systems that meet the requirements\nof section\n232-2.4\n(a)(4)\nand\n232-2.4\n(a)(5)\nof\nthis Subpart, and external door fans that meet the requirements of section\n232-2.4\n(a)(3), may\nbe operated at existing dry cleaning facilities as specified below: (a) Fourth generation machines that were\nconverted from third generation on or before May 15, 2001; (b) Fourth generation machines that were\ninstalled before September 24, 2003; (c) External door fans retrofitted on fourth\ngeneration dry cleaning machines prior to the effective date of this\n\nSubpart; (d) Certified fourth\ngeneration machines at co-located residential facilities that were installed on\nor before December 21, 2005; and\n(e) Certified fourth generation machines at\nstand-alone and co-located commercial facilities that were installed prior to\nthe effective date of this\n\nSubpart.
