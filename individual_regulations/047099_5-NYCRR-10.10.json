  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 5 § 10.10 - Boundary revisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\napplicant municipality of an empire zone may, by resolution, submit to the\ncommissioner a request to revise the boundaries of such empire zone. The\ncommissioner may approve such revision subject to the following provisions: (1)\nthe commissioner must determine that a\nchange in circumstances has occurred since the establishment of the existing\nborders which makes revision of such borders necessary or desirable; and\n(2)\nthe commissioner shall\naffirm that such revision would not have the effect of producing an empire zone\nwhich does not satisfy the criteria for empire zone designation established by\nsections\n10.3\n(a), (b)(3) and\n(4), 10.4, 10.5 and\n10.6\nof this Part; (3)\nthe commissioner may grant approval of\nrevisions of the borders of an empire zone after prior public notice and a\npublic hearing if such revision adds territory to an existing empire zone; and\n(4)\nthe commissioner may grant\napproval of a revision of the borders of an empire zone after public notice of\nsuch proposed revision and a public hearing at least 30 days prior to the\neffective date of such revision, if such revision removes territory from an\nexisting empire zone. (b) The effective date of a boundary revision\nshall be the later of: the date a local law was adopted by the applicant\nmunicipality revising the description of the borders of an empire zone; the\ndate the last resolution or law was adopted by a concurring municipality\nagreeing to the revision proposed by the applicant municipality; or 30 days\nafter a public hearing for revisions that add or remove zone acreage. (c) It is the policy to allow each zone no\nmore than one boundary revision within a 12-month period. If, however, there is\na change involving extenuating factors within the 12-month period, such as the\nattraction/retention of a regionally significant project as defined in section\n10.2\n(u) of this\n\nPart, which is consistent with the applicable zone's zone development plan, the\nrequest will be considered. (d) Any\nrequest to revise the boundaries of an existing empire zone that would add or\nremove acreage from a zone shall not be submitted until the provisions of this\nsubdivision are satisfied and the designation of the distinct and separate\ncontiguous areas are submitted as required by section\n957\nof\nthe General Municipal Law, unless the zone administrative board demonstrates\nthat prior to April 1, 2005 it has been working in conjunction with a business\nfor the purpose of submitting such boundary revision that would result in the\ncreation of jobs within the zone. For purposes of section\n187-j\nand articles\n9\n- A, 22, 32\nand\n33\nof the Tax Law, such business shall be\ndeemed to have been certified prior to April 1, 2005. (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of this\nsection, for any empire zone acreage designated as a result of a revision of\nthe borders of an empire zone prior to April 1, 2005 that is outside of the\ndistinct and separate contiguous areas that has not demonstrated any\nappreciable commercial activity and/or any appreciable capital improvement over\na two-year period from the time of designation, such acreage shall be\nidentified by the local empire zone administrative board, which shall determine\nwhether such acreage has been proposed for development in a manner consistent\nwith the applicable zone's zone development plan. If such acreage has not been\nproposed for development in such manner, the local empire zone administrative\nboard shall remove such acreage from the zone. Any affected business or\nbusinesses shall be immediately decertified. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
