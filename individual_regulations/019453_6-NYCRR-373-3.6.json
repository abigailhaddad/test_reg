  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.6 - Ground-water monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nThe owner or\noperator of a surface impoundment, landfill or land treatment facility which is\nused to manage hazardous waste must implement a ground-water monitoring program\ncapable of determining the facility's impact on the quality of ground water in\nthe uppermost aquifer underlying the facility, except as section\n373-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart and paragraph (3) of this subdivision provide otherwise. (2)\n\nExcept as paragraphs (3) and (4) of this\nsubdivision provide otherwise, the owner or operator must install, operate and\nmaintain a ground-water monitoring system which meets the requirements of\nsubdivision (b) of this section and must comply with subdivisions (c)-(e). This\nground-water monitoring program must be carried out during the active life of\nthe facility, and for disposal facilities, excluding thermal treatment, incineration and energy recovery facilities, during the post-closure care\nperiod as well. (3)\n\nAll or part of\nthe ground-water monitoring requirements of this section may be waived if the\nowner or operator can demonstrate that there is a low potential for migration\nof hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents from the facility via the\nuppermost aquifer to water supply wells (domestic, industrial or agricultural)\nor to surface water. This demonstration must be in writing, and must be kept at\nthe facility. This demonstration must be certified by a qualified geologist or\ngeotechnical engineer and must establish the following: (i) the potential for migration of hazardous\nwaste or hazardous waste constituents from the facility to the uppermost\naquifer, by an evaluation of: (a) a water\nbalance of precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff and infiltration; and\n(b) unsaturated zone\ncharacteristics (\ni.e., geologic materials, physical\nproperties, and depth to ground water); and\n(ii)\nthe potential for hazardous waste or\nhazardous waste constituents which enter the uppermost aquifer to migrate to a\nwater supply well or surface water, by an evaluation of: (a) saturated zone characteristics\n(\ni.e., geologic materials, physical properties, and rate of\nground-water flow); and\n(b) the\nproximity of the facility to water supply wells or surface water. (4)\n\nIf an owner or\noperator assumes (or knows) that ground-water monitoring of indicator\nparameters in accordance with subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section would\nshow statistically significant increases (or decreases, in the case of pH) when\nevaluated under subdivision (d) of this section, an alternate ground-water\nmonitoring system (other than the one described in subdivisions [b] and [c])\nmay be installed, operated and maintained. If the owner or operator decides to\nuse an alternate ground-water monitoring system, the owner or operator must: (i) prepare and submit to the department a\nspecific plan, certified by a qualified geologist or geotechnical engineer, which satisfies the requirements of subparagraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section\nfor an alternate groundwater monitoring system. This plan is to be placed in\nthe facility's operating record and maintained until closure of the\nfacility; (ii)\ninitiate the\ndeterminations specified in subparagraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section; (iii)\nprepare a report in accordance with\nsubparagraph (d)(4)(v) of this section and place it in the facility's operating\nrecord and maintain until closure of the facility; and\n(iv)\ncontinue to make the determinations\nspecified in subparagraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section on a quarterly basis until\nfinal closure of the facility; and\n(v) comply with the recordkeeping and\nreporting requirements in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. (5)\n\nThe ground-water monitoring\nrequirements of this section may be waived with respect to any surface\nimpoundment that: (i) is used to neutralize\nwastes which are hazardous solely because they exhibit the corrosivity\ncharacteristic under section\n371.3\n(c) of this\n\nTitle or are listed as hazardous wastes in section\n371.4\nof this Title only for this\nreason; and\n(ii)\ncontains no other\nhazardous wastes, if the owner or operator can demonstrate that there is no\npotential for migration of hazardous wastes from the impoundment. The\ndemonstration must establish, based upon consideration of the characteristics\nof the wastes and the impoundment, that the corrosive wastes will be\nneutralized to the extent that they no longer meet the corrosivity\ncharacteristic before they can migrate out of the impoundment. The\ndemonstration must be in writing and must be certified by a qualified\nprofessional. (6)\n\nThe\ndepartment may replace all or part of the requirements of this Subpart applying\nto a regulated unit (as defined in section\n373-2.6\n[a]\nof this\n\nPart), with alternative requirements developed for groundwater monitoring set\nout in an approved closure or post-closure plan or in an enforceable document\n(as defined in section\n373-1.2\n[e][3]\nof\nthis Part), where the department determines that: (i) a regulated unit is situated among solid\nwaste management units (or areas of concern), a release has occurred, and both\nthe regulated unit and one or more solid waste management unit(s) (or areas of\nconcern) are likely to have contributed to the release; and\n(ii)\nit is not necessary to apply the\nrequirements of this section because the alternative requirements will protect\nhuman health and the environment. The alternative standards for the regulated\nunit must meet the requirements of section\n373-2.6\n(l)(1)\nof\nthis Part. (b) Ground-water monitoring\nsystem. (1)\nA ground-water monitoring\nsystem must be capable of yielding ground-water samples for analysis and must\nconsist of: (i) monitoring wells (at least\none) installed hydraulically upgradient (\ni.e., in the\ndirection of increasing static head) from the limit of the waste management\narea. Their number, locations and depths must be sufficient to yield\nground-water samples that are: (a) representative of background ground-water quality in the uppermost aquifer near\nthe facility; and\n(b) not affected\nby the facility; and\n(ii)\nmonitoring wells (at least three)\ninstalled hydraulically downgradient (\ni.e., in the direction\nof decreasing static head) at the limit of the waste management area. Their\nnumber, locations and depths must ensure that they immediately detect any\nstatistically significant amounts of hazardous waste or hazardous waste\nconstituents that migrate from the waste management area to the uppermost\naquifer. (iii)\n\nThe facility owner\nor operator may demonstrate that an alternate hydraulically downgradient\nmonitoring well location will meet the criteria outlined below. The\ndemonstration must be in writing and kept at the facility. The demonstration\nmust be certified by a qualified ground-water scientist and establish that: (a) an existing physical obstacle prevents\nmonitoring well installation at the hydraulically downgradient limit of the\nwaste management area; and\n(b) the\nselected alternate downgradient location is as close to the limit of the waste\nmanagement area as practical; and\n(c) the location ensures detection that, given the alternate location, is as early as possible of any statistically\nsignificant amounts of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents that\nmigrate from the waste management area to the uppermost aquifer; and\n(d) lateral expansion, new or replacement\nunits are not eligible for an alternate downgradient location under this\nparagraph. (2)\n\nSeparate monitoring systems for each\nwaste management component of a facility are not required, provided that\nprovisions for sampling upgradient and downgradient water quality will detect\nany discharge from the waste management area. The commissioner may require\nseparate monitoring systems for separate waste management components. (i) In the case of a facility consisting of\nonly one surface impoundment, landfill or land treatment area, the waste\nmanagement area is described by the waste boundary (perimeter). (ii)\n\nIn the case of a facility consisting of\nmore than one surface impoundment, landfill or land treatment area, the waste\nmanagement area is described by an imaginary boundary line which circumscribes\nthe several waste management components. (3)\n\nAll monitoring wells must be cased in a\nmanner that maintains the integrity of the monitoring well bore hole. This\ncasing must be screened or perforated, and packed with gravel or sand where\nnecessary, to enable sample collection at depths where appropriate aquifer flow\nzones exist. The annular space (\ni.e., the space between the\nbore hole and well casing) above the sampling depth must be sealed with a\nsuitable material (\ne.g., cement grout or bentonite slurry) to\nprevent contamination of samples and the ground water. (c) Sampling and analysis. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator must obtain and\nanalyze samples from the installed ground-water monitoring system. The owner or\noperator must develop and follow a ground-water sampling and analysis plan. This plan must be kept at the facility. The plan must include procedures and\ntechniques for: (i) sample\ncollection; (ii)\nsample\npreservation and shipment; (iii)\nanalytical procedures; and\n(iv)\nchain of custody control. Note: See \"Procedures Manual For Groundwater Monitoring At\n\nSolid Waste Disposal Facilities,\" EPA-530/SW-611, August 1977, and \"Methods for\n\nChemical Analysis of Water and Wastes,\" EPA-600/4-79-020, March 1979, for\ndiscussions of sampling and analysis procedures (see 6 NYCRR\n370.1\n[e]). (2)\n\nThe owner or operator must determine the concentration or value of the\nfollowing parameters in ground-water samples in accordance with paragraphs (3)\nand (4) of this subdivision: (i) parameters\ncharacterizing the suitability of the ground water as a drinking water supply, as specified in Appendix 27, infra; and\n(ii)\nparameters establishing ground-water\nquality: (a) chloride; (b) iron; (c) manganese; (d) phenols; (e) sodium; and\n(f) sulfate; and\n(iii)\nparameters used as indicators of\nground-water contamination: (a) pH; (b) specific conductance; (c) total organic carbon; and\n(d) total organic halogen. Note: These parameters are to be used as a basis for comparison\nin the event a ground-water quality assessment is required under paragraph\n(d)(4) of this section. (3)\n(i) For\nall monitoring wells, the owner or operator must establish initial background\nconcentrations or values of all parameters specified in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. This must be done quarterly for one year. (ii)\n\nFor each of the indicator parameters\nspecified in subparagraph (2)(iii) of this subdivision, at least four replicate\nmeasurements must be obtained for each sample, and the initial background\narithmetic mean and variance must be determined by pooling the replicate\nmeasurements for the respective parameter concentrations or values in samples\nobtained from upgradient wells during the first year. (4)\n\nAfter the first year, all monitoring\nwells must be sampled and the samples analyzed with the following frequencies: (i) Samples collected to establish\nground-water quality must be obtained and analyzed for the parameters specified\nin subparagraph (2)(ii) of this subdivision at least annually. (ii)\n\nSamples collected to indicate\nground-water contamination must be obtained and analyzed for the parameters\nspecified in subparagraph (2)(iii) of this subdivision at least\nsemiannually. (5)\n\nElevation of the ground-water surface at each monitoring well must be\ndetermined each time a sample is obtained. (d) Preparation, evaluation, and\nresponse. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator\nmust prepare an outline of the ground-water quality assessment program. The\noutline must describe a more comprehensive ground-water monitoring program\n(than that described in subdivisions [b] and [c] of this section), capable of\ndetermining: (i) whether hazardous waste or\nhazardous waste constituents have entered the ground water; (ii)\nthe rate and extent of migration of\nhazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents in the ground water; and\n(iii)\nthe concentrations of\nhazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents in the ground water. (2)\n\nFor each indicator parameter\nspecified in subparagraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section, the owner or operator\nmust calculate the arithmetic mean and variance, based on at least four\nreplicate measurements on each sample, for each well monitored in accordance\nwith subparagraph (c)(4)(ii), and compare these results with its initial\nbackground arithmetic mean. The comparison must consider individually each of\nthe wells in the monitoring system, and must use the student's t-test at the\n0.01 level of significance (see Appendix 28, infra\n) to\ndetermine statistically significant increases (and decreases, in the case of\npH) over initial background. (3)\n(i) If the comparisons for the upgradient\nwells made under paragraph (2) of this subdivision show a significant increase\n(or pH decrease), the owner or operator must submit this information in\naccordance with clause (e)(1)(ii)(\nb\n) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nIf the comparisons\nfor downgradient wells made under paragraph (2) of this subdivision show a\nsignificant increase (or pH decrease), the owner or operator must then\nimmediately obtain additional ground-water samples from those downgradient\nwells where a significant difference was detected, split the samples in two, and obtain analyses of all additional samples to determine whether the\nsignificant difference was a result of laboratory error. (4)\n(i) If\nthe analyses performed under subparagraph (3)(ii) of this subdivision confirm\nthe significant increase (or pH decrease), the owner or operator must provide\nwritten notice to the commissioner, within seven days of the date of such\nconfirmation, that the facility may be affecting ground-water\nquality. (ii)\n\nWithin 15 days after\nthe notification under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the owner or\noperator must develop and submit to the department a specific plan, based on\nthe outline required under paragraph (1) of this subdivision and certified by a\nqualified geologist or geotechnical engineer, for a ground-water quality\nassessment the facility. This plan must be placed in the facility operating\nrecord and be maintained until closure of the facility. (iii)\n\nThe plan to be submitted under\nsubparagraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, or subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, must specify: (a) the number, location and\ndepth of wells; (b) sampling and\nanalytical methods for those hazardous wastes or hazardous waste constituents\nin the facility; (c) evaluation\nprocedures, including any use of previously gathered ground-water quality\ninformation; and\n(d) a schedule of\nimplementation. (iv)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must implement the ground-water quality assessment plan which\nsatisfies the requirements of subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph and, at a\nminimum, determine: (a) the rate and extent of\nmigration of the hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents in the ground\nwater; and\n(b) the concentrations\nof the hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents in the ground\nwater. (v) The owner or\noperator must make the first determination under subparagraph (iv) of this\nparagraph as soon as technically feasible, and, within 15 days after that\ndetermination, submit to the department a written report containing an\nassessment of the ground-water quality. This report must be placed in the\nfacility operating record and be maintained until closure of the\nfacility. (vi)\n\nIf the owner or\noperator determines, based on the results of the first determination under\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, that no hazardous waste or hazardous waste\nconstituents from the facility have entered the ground water, then the owner or\noperator may reinstate the indicator evaluation program described in\nsubdivision (c) of this section and paragraph (2) of this subdivision; the\nowner or operator must so notify the commissioner in the report submitted under\nsubparagraph (v) of this paragraph. (vii)\n\nIf the owner or operator determines, based on the first determination under subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, that hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents from the facility have\nentered the ground water, then the owner or operator: (a) must continue to make the determinations\nrequired under subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph on a quarterly basis until\nfinal closure of the facility, if the ground-water quality assessment plan was\nimplemented prior to final closure of the facility; or\n(b) may cease to make the determinations\nrequired under subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, if the ground-water quality\nassessment plan was implemented during the post- closure care period. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding any\nother provision of this section, any ground-water quality assessment to satisfy\nthe requirements of subparagraph (4)(iv) of this subdivision which is initiated\nprior to final closure of the facility must be completed and reported in\naccordance with subparagraph (4)(v). (6)\n\nUnless the ground water is monitored to\nsatisfy the requirements of subparagraph (4)(iv) of this subdivision, at least\nannually the owner or operator must evaluate the data on ground-water surface\nelevations obtained under paragraph (c)(5) of this section to determine whether\nthe requirements under paragraph (b)(1) of this section for locating the\nmonitoring wells continue to be satisfied. If the evaluation shows that\nparagraph (b)(1) is no longer satisfied, the owner or operator must immediately\nmodify the number, location or depth of the monitoring wells to bring the\nground-water monitoring system into compliance with this requirement. (e) Recordkeeping and\nreporting. (1)\n\nUnless the ground water\nis monitored to satisfy the requirements of subparagraph (d)(4)(iv) of this\nsection, the owner or operator must: (i) keep\nrecords of the analyses required in paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) of this section, the associated ground-water surface elevations required in paragraph (c)(5), and the evaluations required in paragraph (d)(2) throughout the active life of\nthe facility, and, for disposal facilities, throughout the post-closure care\nperiod as well; and\n(ii)\nreport the\nfollowing ground-water monitoring information to the commissioner; (a) during the first year when initial\nbackground concentrations are being established for the facility: concentrations or values of the parameters listed in subparagraph (c)(2)(i) of\nthis section for each ground-water monitoring well within 15 days after\ncompleting each quarterly analysis. The owner or operator must separately\nidentify for each monitoring well any parameters whose concentration or value\nhas been found to exceed the maximum contaminant levels listed in Appendix 27, infra; (b) annually: concentrations or values of the parameters listed in subparagraph\n(c)(2)(iii) of this section for each ground-water monitoring well, along with\nthe required evaluations for these parameters under paragraph (d)(2). The owner\nor operator must separately identify any significant differences from initial\nbackground found in the upgradient wells, in accordance with subparagraph\n(d)(3)(i). During the active life of the facility, this information must be\nsubmitted as part of the annual report required under section\n373-3.5\n(e) of this\n\nSubpart; and\n(c) as a part of the\nannual report required under section\n373-3.5\n(e) of this\n\nSubpart: results of the evaluations of ground-water surface elevations under\nparagraph (c)(5) of this section, and a description of the response to that\nevaluation, where applicable. (2)\n\nIf the ground water is monitored to\nsatisfy the requirements of subparagraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, the owner\nor operator must: (i) keep records of the\nanalyses and evaluations specified in the plan, which satisfy the requirements\nof subparagraph (d)(4)(iii) of this section, throughout the active life of the\nfacility, and, for disposal facilities, throughout the post-closure care period\nas well; and\n(ii)\nannually, until\nfinal closure of the facility, submit to the commissioner a report containing\nthe results of his or her ground water quality assessment program which\nincludes, but is not limited to, the calculated (or measured) rate of migration\nof hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents in the ground water during\nthe reporting period. This information must be submitted no later than March\n1st of the following calendar year. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
