Counties with populations of 200,000 or less at the time\nof their initial application for program financial assistance, as defined by\nthe latest Census of the United States, are eligible applicants for State\nfinancial assistance through the Program. (b) Application process. (1)\n\nEligible counties shall apply for program\nfunds using application instructions and forms supplied by the Department. Such\napplications shall be certified by the chief executive officer of the county, if any, or the chairperson of the county legislative body, and shall include\nbut are not limited to, the general intent and purpose of the project; a\ngeneral statement of the expected benefits to derive therefrom; and an\norganizational statement, designating the person responsible for managing the\ngrant, and the manner by which the county will maintain oversight of the\nexpenditure of grant funds. (2)\n\nEach application submitted to the Department for a financial assistance grant\nshall be accompanied by an itemized preliminary grant budget, certified by the\nchief elected or financial officer of the county, identifying expected eligible\ncosts, and amounts and sources of grant funding including the applicable county\nshare of funds. (3)\n\nEach\napplication for financial assistance shall include an appropriate certification\nby the county governing body that it has appropriated, or will appropriate, any\nrequired county share of grant costs; or, such certification may be provided\nafter notice of a grant but before execution of the grant by the\n\nState. (4)\n\nThe failure to file an\napplication for aid in any year shall not impair the right of a rural county to\nfile an application for aid in any subsequent year. (5)\n\nThe Department shall notify an applicant\nfor a planning and implementation grant of the disposition of its application\nwithin six months of the date of its receipt by the Department. In most cases, Department notification will occur within 60 days. The Department shall notify\nan applicant for operating assistance of the disposition of its application\nwithin 90 days of the date of its receipt by the Department. (6)\n\nShould an application for financial aid\nbe incomplete or disapproved by the Department, the Department will advise the\napplicant of the reasons for same no later than the time of its written\nnotification to the applicant of the disposition of its application. (7)\n\nApplicants may submit modifications to\napplications, or entirely new applications, within schedules for same\nestablished by the Department. (c) Financial assistance for planning and\nimplementation of a coordinated public transportation service. Grants for\nfinancial assistance for the planning and implementation of a coordinated\npublic transportation service shall be awarded in amounts up to $45,000 per\nyear for those awarded prior to July 21, 1989 and up to $55,000 per year for\nthose awarded on or after July 21, 1989, for up to three successive years, subject to the amounts of annual appropriations to be included in the State\n\nBudget and other conditions of this Part. Approval of an initial grant shall\nreflect an ongoing commitment to the extent necessary to develop and implement\na county plan. Funds received shall be utilized by a county solely to pay for\neligible costs incurred in the development and implementation of a coordinated\npublic transportation service plan for said county. (1)\n\nEligible planning and implementation\nexpenses. Costs eligible for payment by the State under a planning and\nimplementation grant are those direct costs incurred following notification by\nthe Department to the County that a planning and implementation grant is to be\nawarded. Such expenses shall be specified in the grant budget approved by the\n\nDepartment and may include the following: (i) planning consultant costs; (ii)\nsalary and fringe benefit costs of county staff, grant manager, and/or services\ncoordinator, in performing grant work; (iii)\ngrant-related travel expenses of county\nstaff and/or services coordinator for travel within the county, or to adjacent\ncounties for purposes of inter-county coordination; (iv)\nprinting and copying expenses; (v) costs associated with conducting and\nrecording the public hearing on the draft county plans; (vi)\ndirect costs associated with\nestablishing the coordinated service, including advertising costs expended\nduring the recruitment of personnel, and salary and fringe benefit costs of\nadditional or new management personnel; (vii)\ncosts of legal work associated with\nincorporation, contracting or leasing; (viii)\ncosts of additional insurance for\nexpanded or altered vehicle operations; (ix)\ncosts associated with upgrading existing\nvehicles to secure NYSDOT vehicle inspections; costs to paint or otherwise\nmodify vehicles for system identity; (x) the purchase of radio equipment and\nfareboxes for existing vehicles (eligible only in second or third-year\ngrants); (xi)\nthe purchase of\nmicrocomputers and associated microcomputer items (eligible only in second or\nthird-year grants); (xii)\nadditional vehicles, other than those being purchased through other programs, may be purchased through a county's third-year implementation grant, provided\nthat the county's coordinated public transportation service, described in its\nadopted plan, has begun operation; the county government or its public\ntransportation authority shall be the owner of any vehicles purchased through\nprogram funds. (2)\n\nIneligible costs. The following categories of costs are not eligible for\nreceipt of State financial assistance through a planning and implementation\ngrant: (i) any costs incurred prior to the\ncounty receiving written notice from the Department that it may proceed to\nincur costs; (ii)\nany indirect\ncosts, such as floor space; (iii)\ncosts incurred for out-of-State travel, unless specifically authorized in\nadvance by the Department; (iv)\ncosts that were previously paid for by other program funds; (v) costs ordinarily considered as normal\noperating expenses of providing passenger transportation service, for services\nthat existed prior to the implementation of the coordinated public\ntransportation service; (vi)\ncosts\nof services or activities of county government or other entities which are not\ndirectly related to, or required by, the purposes of this Part. (3)\n\nCounty government share of\neligible planning and implementation expenses. To be eligible for financial\nassistance for planning and implementation, county government recipients of\nsuch assistance shall appropriate and expend county funds for eligible grant\nexpenses equivalent to at least 10 percent of the State funds paid for a\nfirst-year grant, 20 percent of those of a second-year grant, and 30 percent of\nthose of a third-year grant. The source(s) of monies used to provide the county\ngovernment share shall be general purpose revenues available to the county\ngovernment, the use of which is solely at the discretion of the county. A\ncounty staff may itself perform grant work, and a county's payment of such\ndirect, in-kind grant expenses may be included as county share funds. A county\nshall include the amount of its share as an appropriation for the Rural Public\n\nTransportation Coordination Assistance Program in its applicable county budgets\nand shall submit copies of same to the Department. (4)\n\nSelection criteria. The department has, in consultation with the Committee, established standards and criteria to guide\nthe selection of counties to be awarded planning and implementation grants. Such standards and criteria are the following: (i) the potential likelihood of a county\nestablishing a successful program; (ii)\nthe level and degree of commitment of\ncounty government support for the program on a continuing basis; (iii)\nthe level and degree of support for the\nobjectives of the program from current providers and operators; and\n(iv)\nthe extent to which transportation\nservice, facilities, equipment, usage, cost and revenue data is made available\nto the county by potential participants. (d) Financial assistance for operating\nexpenses. (1)\n\nEligibility. For those rural\ncounties having an approved coordinated public transportation service plan and\nhaving implemented such service which has maintained existing levels of funding\nused for transportation by the coordinated service, and when the need for\nadditional operating aid has been documented, the Department may, in\nconsultation with the Committee, grant up to $35,000 per year for operating aid\nfor up to five successive years, subject to annual appropriations to be\nincluded in the State Budget. Such aid may be extended annually when the county\nor operator of the coordinated public transportation service has adequately\ndemonstrated to the Department the need for such continued aid. Following\nformal adoption of a rural county's coordinated public transportation service\nplan and approval of that plan by the Department, and upon receipt of written\nnotice from a rural county that its coordinated public transportation service\nis about to commence in accordance with such approved plan, the Department\nshall forward operating aid applications to the chief executive officer of the\ncounty, if any, or the chairperson of the county legislative body, along with\ninstructions and a timetable for their completion. (2)\n\nEligible operating assistance expenses\nand services. (i) Eligible expenses. Expenses\nwhich are eligible for program operating assistance shall be those incurred by\nthe coordinated service operator, in providing eligible transportation service, which are necessary for the continuing management, operation and maintenance of\nthe service and may include the following: (a) salary and fringe benefits of\nprofessional management and administrative personnel; (b) salary and fringe benefits of operating\npersonnel, such as dispatchers, drivers, mechanics, etc.; (c) purchase of fuel, oil, tires, parts and\nsupplies; (d) rent of buildings, garage and office space; (e) insurance and legal costs; (f) advertising and marketing the coordinated service to improve\nridership; (g) purchase of\nmaintenance or other services from third-party subcontractors; (h) indirect expenses in accordance with a\nreasonable cost allocation method approved by the Department; (i) preparing applications for federal or\n\nState funds or grants, and related activities; (j) a reasonable allowance for profit, as\ndetermined by the department, for bus or taxi companies providing eligible\npassenger transportation services. (ii)\n\nEligible services. To be considered as a\npart of a county's coordinated public transportation service and eligible for\nprogram operating assistance, transportation service components must meet the\nfollowing conditions: (a) be operated by the\ncounty's designated coordinated service operator, or managed by said operator\nthrough a sub-contract; (b) be open\nto the general public on an equal opportunity basis in accordance with other\nterms and conditions of this Part; (c) have publicly posted and distributed\nservice areas, routes, fares, rates and hours of operation, which are\nadvertised and marketed regularly and widely throughout the county in such a\nmanner that facilitates knowledge of the availability and details of the\nservice by all transportation disadvantaged persons and other members of the\npublic. All modes of service, such as fixed-route, point or\nroute-deviation or demand-responsive services, are eligible for inclusion. Services may not be limited to current users or current agency-affiliated\nclientele. Portions of a coordinated service which are advertised, marketed and\noperated as open to the public on an equal opportunity basis, as well as\nspecialized service components of such a service, will be eligible for federal\nand State public transportation operating assistance, if they also meet other\neligibility requirements of those programs. Client specific services, which\nexist primarily to serve agency clientele or to transport agency clientele to\nand from agency programs and which give preference in service orientation or\nseat availability to agency clients, may be included in a county's coordinated\nservice. In such cases, agency funds shall pay for the fully allocated cost of\nsuch services, after subtracting any income from fare-paying riders. Other than\nagency-affiliated passengers transported on client-specific service components, all passengers transported by a county's coordinated public transportation\nservice must be revenue-generating passengers on an individual passenger trip\nbasis. This may be accomplished by: (1)\nindividuals paying their own\nfare; (2)\nindividuals paying their\nfare and obtaining reimbursement from a third-party; or\n(3)\nindividuals obtaining transportation\ntickets or passes from, or otherwise having their trips arranged by, a\nthird-party, such as a human service agency, with the coordinated service\noperator later billing the third-party. Fares must be equitable and not\ndiscriminatory and should be based upon the actual cost of services provided. To be eligible for federal and State public transportation operating assistance\n(see 980.13), such fares and reimbursement rates must be predetermined and\npublicly posted and advertised. In an area where a specialized service, as defined in this\n\nPart, is offered and is to be considered part of a county's coordinated public\ntransportation service, the county's coordinated service must also offer\nservice to the general public on an equal opportunity basis to generally the\nsame extent and degree--in terms of service levels, operating hours and\ngeographic coverage--as the specialized service. (3)\n\nIneligible costs. The following\ncategories of expenses are not eligible for operating assistance through the\nprogram: (i) purchase or construction of\ncapital equipment or facilities; (ii)\nexpenses of client-specific\ntransportation services ordinarily provided by a human service agency when such\nservices are not under the operational control of the county's coordinated\nservice operator; (iii)\nexpenses\nfor ineligible transportation services as determined by Law or Department\nguidelines including rail, air, water, freight, emergency medical, charter or\ntour transportation services; (iv)\nexpenses for any purchases or services which are not under the management and\noperational control of the county's coordinated service operator. (4)\n\nCounty government share of\neligible operating assistance expenses. No operating aid shall be paid to any\nrural county unless such county appropriates and expends at least 20 percent of\nthe coordinated public transportation service's total annual administrative and\noperating costs for the provision of public transportation service. Except for\nother public transportation monies paid by the Department to the county and any\nrequired local share necessary to receive those monies, such amount may include\nany county funds used for operating aid, including funds previously used to\nsupport any other transportation service, that have been appropriated to an\naccount under the management and control of the county's coordinated service\noperator for the provision of public transportation service. Funds available to county government agencies in a rural\ncounty that had been used to pay for a human service agency's client-specific\ntransportation services prior to the establishment of the county's coordinated\npublic transportation service, but which are re-directed by a county to its\ncoordinated service operator for the operation of public transportation service\nas defined in this Part, may be included as county share regardless of the\noriginal source of such funds. Operating revenue generated by the operation of\nthose portions of the coordinated public transportation service which are open\nto the public on an equal opportunity basis, including passenger fares and\nthird-party passenger-based reimbursements, and advertising revenue, may be\ncounted as county share provided that the amount of such operating revenue is\ncertified by the county and is taken into account in determining the county's\nneed for, and annual amount of, program operating assistance. Notwithstanding\nany other provision of this Part, a county's share of a Program operating\nassistance grant must actually be expended on the transportation service to be\nmanaged by the county's coordinated service operator and shall be fully and\nexplicitly included in any accounting of grant revenues. (e) Other provisions related to financial\nassistance. (1)\n\nIn the event a county's plan\nis completed and approved within one year, any remaining unexpended grant funds\nmay be used to implement the plan. In no event shall a county's Program grant\nin any one year exceed $45,000 if awarded prior to July 21, 1989 or $55,000 if\nawarded on or after July 21, 1989 for planning or implementation, or $35,000\nfor operating aid. (2)\nA county's\nfirst, second and third-year grants for planning and implementation shall\ngenerally be completed within one-year time periods, except that such periods\nmay be modified by the Department if necessary to facilitate grant completion\nand successful implementation, or to simplify program administration. (3)\n\nIf a county should initially apply for a\nprogram grant in an amount which is less than that for which it is eligible\nunder this Part, it may amend its application at a later time to apply for\nadditional funds up to the limits prescribed in this Part, provided that the\napplicable requirements for the county's share of program funds are fully\nmet. (4)\nA rural county which has\ndeveloped a plan for a coordinated public transportation service without the\nuse of program funds and has not implemented that service shall be eligible to\napply for program funds to implement and operate its coordinated service under\nthe following conditions: (i) the county's\nplan meets the content and process requirements of the Department's planning\nguidelines in every respect; (ii)\nthe county shall first have met the public hearing and other requirements of\nthis Part pertaining to its coordinated service plan; and\n(iii)\nthe Department shall first have\napproved the county's plan. Such county shall only be eligible for second and\nthird-year implementation grants and, in any case, no program funds may be used\nto pay for work or expenses previously performed or incurred in planning for\nthe coordinated service. (5)\nA rural county which has already\nestablished a countywide public transportation service or is a member of a\npublic transportation authority district providing such a service but does not\noffer a coordinated public transportation service as defined in this Part, shall be eligible for not more than two years of program financial assistance\nfor the planning and implementation of a coordinated public transportation\nservice. (6)\nA rural county which\nalready has established a coordinated transportation service and that service\nis not a public transportation service as defined in this Part, shall be\neligible for not more than two years of program financial assistance for the\nplanning and implementation of a coordinated public transportation service. In\nsuch cases, no program funds may be used to pay for work or expenses previously\nperformed or incurred in developing the coordinated service. (7)\nA rural county which already has\nestablished and implemented a coordinated public transportation service, or is\na member of a public transportation authority district providing such a service\nin said county, shall not be eligible for program grants for planning and\nimplementation. Such a county shall be eligible for program operating\nassistance in accordance with this Part only after it has provided a\ncoordinated public transportation service plan to the Department and such plan\nhas been approved by the Department as meeting the requirements of this\n\nPart. (8)\n\nIn awarding program\ngrants for the planning and implementation of a coordinated public\ntransportation service, the Department may give priority consideration to rural\ncounties in which there does not exist a countywide coordinated transportation\nservice or a countywide public transportation service. (9)\n\nIn awarding program operating assistance\ngrants, the department may give priority consideration to rural counties that\nhave formally participated in the planning and implementation phases of the\nprogram. (10)\n\nThe Department may\napprove a county's coordinated public transportation service plan on a\nconditional basis in advance of final approval, for the purpose of awarding\nthat county a second-year planning and implementation grant in order that the\ncounty's planning and implementation process may continue\nuninterrupted. (11)\n\nThe Department\nmay authorize a portion of a county's second-year planning and implementation\ngrant to be used for completing the county's plan if, in the opinion of the\n\nDepartment, the county has made sufficient progress toward completion of the\n\nPlan with its first-year grant. (12)\n\nConsistent with other provisions of this\n\nPart, any rural county which has previously initiated and is currently\nundertaking activities leading to the development of a coordinated public\ntransportation service, utilizing federal, local or other State funds, shall be\neligible to receive a total of Program funds plus such other assistance up to\nthe limits prescribed in this Part.
