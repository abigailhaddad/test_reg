  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1035.2 - Eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The following\nindividuals are ADA-paratransit-eligible: (1)\nany individual with a disability who is unable, as the result of a physical or\nmental impairment (including a vision impairment), and without the assistance\nof another individual (except the operator of a wheelchair lift or other\nboarding assistance device), to board, ride, or disembark from any vehicle on\nthe system which is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with\ndisabilities; or\n(2)\nany individual\nwith a disability who needs the assistance of a wheelchair lift or other\nboarding device and is able, with such assistance, to board, ride and disembark\nfrom any vehicle which is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with\ndisabilities if the individual wants to travel on a route on the system during\nthe hours of operation of the system at a time, or within a reasonable period\nof such time, when such vehicle is not being used to provide designated public\ntransportation on the route: (i) an\nindividual is eligible under this paragraph with respect to travel on an\notherwise accessible route on which the boarding and disembarking location\nwhich the individual would use is one at which boarding or disembarking from\nthe vehicle is precluded as provided because the vehicle's wheelchair lift or\nother boarding device cannot be deployed; or the lift or device would be\ndamaged if deployed; or temporary conditions at the location, not under the\nauthority's control, preclude safe use of the stop by all passengers; (ii)\nan individual using a common wheelchair\nis eligible under this paragraph if the individual's wheelchair cannot be\naccommodated on an existing vehicle, even if that vehicle is accessible to\nother individuals with disabilities and their mobility wheelchairs; (iii)\nwith respect to the rapid transit\nsystem, an individual is eligible under this paragraph if the individual could\nuse an accessible rapid transit system, but there is not yet one accessible car\nper train on the system; or key stations designated in the authority's Key\n\nStation Plan have not yet been made accessible; or\n(3)\nany individual with a disability who has\na specific impairment-related condition which prevents such individual from\ntraveling to a boarding location or from a disembarking location on such\nsystem: (i) only a specific\nimpairment-related condition which prevents the individual from traveling to a\nboarding location or from a disembarking location is a basis for eligibility\nunder this paragraph. A condition which makes traveling to a boarding location\nor from a disembarking location more difficult for a person with a specific\nimpairment-related condition than for an individual who does not have the\ncondition, but does not prevent the travel, is not a basis for eligibility\nunder this paragraph; and\n(ii)\narchitectural barriers not under the control of the authority and environmental\nbarriers (e.g., distance, terrain, weather) do not, standing alone, form a\nbasis for eligibility under this paragraph. The interaction of such barriers\nwith an individual's specific impairment-related condition may form a basis for\neligibility under this paragraph if the effect is to prevent the individual\nfrom traveling to a boarding location from a disembarking location. (b) If an individual\nmeets the eligibility criteria of this section with respect to some trips but\nnot others, the individual shall be ADA-paratransit-eligible only for those\ntrips for which he or she meets the criteria. (c) Individuals may be\nADA-paratransit-eligible on the basis of a permanent or a temporary\ndisability. (d) Individuals\naccompanying an ADA-paratransit-eligible individual shall be provided service\nas follows: (1)\none other individual\naccompanying the ADA-paratransit-eligible individual shall be provided service: (i) if the ADA-paratransit-eligible\nindividual is traveling with a personal care attendant, the authority shall\nprovide service to one other individual in addition to the attendant who is\naccompanying the eligible individual; (ii)\na family member or friend is regarded as\na person accompanying the eligible individual, and not as a personal care\nattendant, unless the family member or friend is acting in the capacity of a\npersonal care attendant; (2)\nadditional individuals accompanying the\nADA-paratransit-eligible individual shall be provided service, provided that\nspace is available for them on the paratransit vehicle carrying the\nADA-paratransit-eligible individual and that transportation of the additional\nindividuals will not result in denial of service to ADA-paratransit-eligible\nindividuals; and\n(3)\nin order to be\nconsidered as accompanying the eligible individual for purposes of this\nsection, the other individual(s) shall have the same origin and destination as\nthe eligible individual.
