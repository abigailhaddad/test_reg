(1)\n\nPrimary service area shall\ninclude each of the following within the franchised area: (i) those areas where cable television plant\nhas been built without a contribution-in-aid-of-construction by\nsubscribers; (ii)\nthose areas where\nthe cable television company is obligated by the terms of its franchise to\nprovide cable television service without a contribution-in- aid-of-construction\nby subscribers; (iii)\nany area\nadjoining an area described in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph and\nwhich contains dwelling units at a minimum rate of 35 dwelling units per linear\nmile of aerial cable; (iv)\nany area\nadjoining an area described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph and\nwhich contains at least the same number of dwelling units per linear mile of\naerial cable as is the average number of dwelling units per linear mile of\ncable in areas described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph. The\naverage is to be determined by dividing the sum of the dwelling units in areas\ndescribed in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph by the number of\nlinear miles of cable in the same areas. (2)\n\nLine extension area shall be any area\nwithin the franchised area which is not the primary service area. (b) Where a cable television\nfranchise is awarded, renewed or amended after October 1, 1982, the franchise\nwill be confirmed or the amendment will be approved by the commission only if\nthe franchise contains the following additional minimum franchise standards: (1)\n\nThat, within five years after receipt of\nall necessary operating authorizations, cable television service will be\noffered throughout the authorized area to all subscribers requesting service in\nany primary service area. (2)\n\nThat\ncable television service will not be denied to potential subscribers located in\nline extension areas who are willing to contribute to the cost of construction\nin accordance with the following formula: C equals the cost of construction of new plant; CA equals\nthe average cost of construction per mile in the primary service area; P equals\nthe lower of 35 or the average number of dwelling units per linear mile of\ncable in areas described in subparagraphs (a)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section; LE equals the number of dwelling units requesting service in the line extension\narea; and SC equals subscriber contribution-in-aid-of-construction in the line\nextension area. (i) Whenever a\npotential subscriber located in a line extension area requests service, the\ncable television company shall, within 30 days of the request, conduct a survey\nto determine the number of potential subscribers located in the line extension\narea, and shall inform each of the potential subscribers of the\ncontribution-in-aid-of-construction that may be charged. The cable television\ncompany may require prepayment of the contribution-in-aid-of-construction. The\ncable television company shall apply for pole attachment agreements within 30\ndays of its receipt of the contribution-in-aid-of construction. Cable\ntelevision services must be made available to those who made a\ncontribution-in-aid-of-construction within 90 days from the receipt of pole\nattachment agreements by the cable television company. (ii)\n\nThe contribution-in-aid-of-construction\nshall be in addition to the installation rate set forth in the\nfranchise. (iii)\n\nDuring a five-year\nperiod commencing at the completion of a particular line extension, pro rata\nrefund shall be paid to previous subscribers as new subscribers are added to\nthe particular line extension; the amount of the refund, if any, shall be\ndetermined by application of the formula annually. The refunds shall be paid\nannually to subscribers, or former subscribers, entitled to receive them. The\ncompany shall not be required to provide refunds to any previous subscriber\notherwise entitled to a refund, who is no longer at the same address and who\nhas not informed the company of the subscriber's address. (3)\n\nThat cable television service will be\nprovided to any subscriber who demands service within seven business days of\nthe request for service and who is located within 150 feet of aerial feeder\ncable, and that the charge for the installation for any subscriber so situated\nwill not be in excess of the standard installation charge. (4)\n\nNothing in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision shall be construed to preclude: (i) the provision of cable television\nservices by the franchisee in a line extension area without assessing a\ncontribution-in-aid-of-construction; or\n(ii)\nthe inclusion in a cable television\nfranchise of a provision establishing a primary service area which includes at\nleast all of those areas which are in the primary service area as defined in\nsubdivision (a) of this section. (5)\n\nNothing in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision shall be construed to preclude: (i) the discounting or the waiver of the\nmaximum contribution-in-aid-of-construction charge a cable television company\ncan charge a subscriber pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision; or\n(ii)\nthe inclusion of a\nprovision in a cable television franchise establishing a formula to be used to\ndetermine the contribution-in-aid-of-construction charge, which formula is\ndifferent than the formula set forth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, provided that the formula included in the franchise does not require payment by\nthe subscriber in a line extension area of a higher\ncontribution-in-aid-of-construction charge than would result from the use of\nthe formula set forth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (c) All cable\ntelevision companies operating in the State of New York shall make cable\ntelevision service available to all potential subscribers requesting service\nwho are located in a primary service area as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of\nthis section, and shall make services available in line extension areas as\ndefined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section at charges which may not exceed\nthose provided for in paragraph (b)(2) of this section within the following\nschedule of compliance: (1)\nprior to January\n1, 1984 in any franchise area for which the original certificate of\nconfirmation of the franchise was granted by this commission prior to January\n1, 1979; (2)\nwithin five years from\nthe date the certificate of confirmation was granted by this commission, in any\nfranchise area for which the original certificate of confirmation of the\nfranchise was granted by this commission after January 1, 1979. (d) The provisions of this section\nmay be waived by the commission if the commission determines that compliance\nwith the section would not be possible within the limitations of economic\nfeasibility.
