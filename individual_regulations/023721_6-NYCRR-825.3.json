  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 825.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In table I an item number is assigned consecutively to\neach specifically designated waters. (b) Waters index numbers\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number assigned to any designated waters\nfor the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe\nnumbering or index system used to identify specific waters of New York State\nwas adapted from that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey series of reports on the watersheds of the State. The primary\nwaters of a drainage basin, a stream or large lake, is referred to by name or\nabbreviation. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively as they are\nencountered, such number being preceded by the letter P. This system also\ninvolves the consecutive numbering of tributaries as they enter a stream, progressing upstream from the mouth. Tributaries of lakes or ponds are numbered\nconsecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from\nits outlet or mouth. Isolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index\nnumber merely for convenience of their identification and location within a\nsubdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being\ntributary to any waters to which no surface connection is shown on the\nreference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was\napplied to the basin under consideration by the Conservation Department in its\nreport, A Biological Survey of the Lower Hudson\n\nWatershed-1936, and has been closely followed in connection with the\nidentification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of the stream\nnumbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams originally\nshown on the older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the time of\nits survey but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few\nstreams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the new maps are\ndesignated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Housatonic River drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\n\nMass. Streams with headwaters in New York State which\ntraverse the New York-Massachusetts boundary numbered consecutively from south\nto north. Mass. 5\n\nGreen River\n\nThe 5th stream flowing into Massachusetts across\nthe New York-Massachusetts boundary\n\nMass. 5-4\n\nCrause Creek\n\nThe 4th tributary of Green River within New York\n\nState. Mass. 5-P1137\n\nNo Bottom Pond\n\nThe 1137th pond encountered in the lower Hudson\nwatershed. Conn. Streams with headwaters in New York State which\ntraverse the New York-Connecticut boundary, numbered consecutively from south\nto north. Conn. 15\n\nTenmile River\n\nThe 15th stream flowing into Connecticut across the\n\nNew York-Connecticut boundary. Conn. 15-12\n\nWebatuck Creek\n\nThe 12th tributary of Tenmile River within New York\n\nState. Conn. 15-12-21\n\nTributary of Webatuck Creek\n\nThe 21st tributary of Webatuck Creek. Conn. 15-12-21- P1134\n\nRudd Pond\n\nThe 1134th pond encountered in the lower Hudson\nwatershed. Conn. 15-12-21- P1134-1\n\nTributary of Rudd Pond\n\nThe 1st tributary of Rudd Pond. (c) The abbreviation\ntrib\nand\ntribs\nindicating tributary and tributaries, and the terms\nsubtributary\nand\nsubtributaries\nshall mean\nany stream, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other\nstream, pond or other body of surface water; where no tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated\nwaters shall include only the stream, pond, or other body of water referenced\nby such waters index number; where a tributary, tributaries, subtributary or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, pond, or other body of water\nreferenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and subtributaries\nthereof, which are shown on the reference maps, excluding numbered ponds, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\nknown and which name may appear on the reference maps. In cases of specifically\ndesignated waters which have no name, the named waters to which the unnamed\nwaters are tributary are identified as far as possible. (e) Comments. The column headed \"Comments\" contains designations or\nsegments or sections of waters under consideration to which a particular\nassignment of a class and standards shall apply. Also included in this column\nis any useful information pertinent to the classification or standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as appearing in table I means map reference number and indicates one or more of\nthe following numbered maps reproduced herein completely or in part in section\n825.9, infra, on\nwhich maps the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown\nwithin the topographical limit line of the described drainage basin. The\nfollowing maps were produced from the original maps which may be procured\nthrough the Washington Distribution Section, Geological Survey, Silver Spring, Maryland. Map Ref.
