Tit. 20 §§ 3-8.9 - Examples\n\nState Regulations\n\nExample 1: 2014 Calendar Year (Base Year)\n\nCorporations L, M, N and O are properly included in a\ncombined report. The combined group's base year BAP is 12.50% and the group's\nbase year tax rate is 7.1%. 2015 Calendar Year (First 2015 Taxable Year)\n\nCorporation O files on a separate basis. It is not a\nsmall business taxpayer. To compute its PNOLC subtraction pool, Corporation O\nfirst multiplies its UNOL by its base year combined group's base year BAP and\nbase year tax rate ($7,325 x 12.50% x 7.1%). The result of $65 is divided by\nthe 6.5% conversion percentage to arrive at a PNOLC subtraction pool of $1,000. Since Corporation O properly elected to use the 50% allotment method, its PNOLC\nsubtraction pool is multiplied by 50% to determine its tax period PNOLC\nsubtraction allotment of $500 for the first 2015 taxable year. In the first\n2015 taxable year, the PNOLC subtraction available for use is $500, which is\nequal to its tax period PNOLC subtraction allotment for that year. Corporation\nUNOL\nBase Year BAP\nBase Year Tax Rate\n\nConversion Percentage\nPNOLC Subtraction Pool\nPNOLC Subtraction Allotment Method\n\nTax Period PNOLC Subtraction Allotment\n2015 Calendar Year PNOLC Subtraction Available\nfor Use\nO\n$7,325\n12.50%\n7.10%\n6.50%\n$1,000\n50%\n$500\n$500\n\nCorporations L, M, and N are properly included in a\ncombined report. The combined group is not a small business taxpayer and it\ndoes not elect to use the 50% allotment method. Each member of the combined\ngroup computes its own PNOLC subtraction pool by multiplying its own UNOL by\nthe base year combined group's base year BAP and base year tax rate. The result\nis then divided by the 6.5% conversion percentage to compute the member's PNOLC\nsubtraction pool. Since the combined group is utilizing the 10% allotment\nmethod, each member's PNOLC subtraction pool is multiplied by 10% to arrive at\nthe member's PNOLC subtraction allotment for the first 2015 taxable year. The\ncombined group's tax period PNOLC subtraction allotment for the first 2015\ntaxable year of $3,505 is the sum of L, M, and N's tax period PNOLC subtraction\nallotments for that year. The combined group's PNOLC subtraction available for\nuse in the first 2015 taxable year is $3,505, which is equal to the combined\ngroup's tax period PNOLC subtraction allotment for that year. 2015 Group Member\n\nMember's UNOL\nBase Year BAP\nBase Year Tax Rate\n\nConversion Percentage\n\nMember's PNOLC Subtraction Pool\nPNOLC Subtraction Allotment Method\n\nTax Period PNOLC Subtraction Allotment\n2015 Calendar Year PNOLC Subtraction Available\nfor Use\nL\n$70,000\n12.50%\n7.10%\n6.50%\n$9,558\n10%\n$956\n$956\nM\n$186,700\n12.50%\n7.10%\n6.50%\n$25,492\n10%\n$2,549\n$2,549\nN\n$0\n12.50%\n7.10%\n6.50%\n$0\n$0\n$0\n\nTotals\n$256,700\n$35,050\n$3,505\n$3,505\n\nExample 2: 2014 Calendar Year (Base Year)\n\nCorporations E, F, and G are properly included in a\ncombined report. The combined group's base year BAP is 9.5% and the group's\nbase year tax rate is 7.1%. Corporation H is a small business taxpayer and\nfiles on a separate basis, with a base year BAP of 4.8250% and a base year tax\nrate of 6.5%. Corporation I was not subject to tax in New York State in the\nbase year. Corporation J files on a separate basis, with a base year BAP of\n9.75% and a base year tax rate of 7.1%. 2015 Calendar Year (First 2015 Taxable Year)\n\nCorporations E, F, G, H, and I are properly included in a\ncombined report. Even though Corporation H qualified as a small business\ntaxpayer in 2014, the combined group does not qualify as one in 2015. The\ndesignated agent of the combined group does not elect to use the 50% allotment\nmethod. Each member computes its own PNOLC subtraction pool by multiplying its\nown UNOL by the base year BAP and base year tax rate. Corporations E, F, and G\nhave the same base year BAP and base year tax rate as they were included in the\nsame base year combined group. Corporation H must use its separately filed base\nyear BAP and base year tax rate. As Corporation I was not subject to tax in the\nbase year, it has a 0% base year BAP and 0% base year tax rate. The result is\nthen divided by the 6.5% conversion percentage to compute the member's PNOLC\nsubtraction pool. Since the combined group is utilizing the 10% allotment\nmethod, each member's PNOLC subtraction pool is multiplied by 10% to arrive at\nthe member's PNOLC subtraction allotment for the first 2015 taxable year. The\ncombined group's PNOLC subtraction allotment for the first 2015 taxable year is\n$2,900, which is the sum of E, F, G, H, and I's tax period PNOLC subtraction\nallotments for that year. The combined group's PNOLC subtraction available for\nuse in the first 2015 taxable year is $2,900, which is equal to the tax period\nPNOLC subtraction allotment for that year. The combined group is able to\nutilize the entire PNOLC subtraction available for use so there is no\ncarryforward of PNOLC subtraction from the first 2015 taxable year. 2015 Group Member\n\nMember's UNOL\nBase Year BAP\nBase Year Tax Rate\n\nConversion Percentage\n\nMember's PNOLC Subtraction Pool\nPNOLC Subtraction Allotment Method\nPNOLC Subtraction Allotment\n2015 Calendar Year PNOLC Subtraction Available\nfor Use\nE\n$115,600\n9.50%\n7.10%\n6.50%\n$11,996\n10%\n$1,200\n$1,200\nF\n$28,900\n9.50%\n7.10%\n6.50%\n$2,999\n10%\n$300\n$300\nG\n$57,800\n9.50%\n7.10%\n6.50%\n$5,998\n10%\n$600\n$600\nH\n$165,800\n4.83%\n6.50%\n6.50%\n$8,000\n10%\n$800\n$800\nI\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n$0\n\nTotal\n$368,100\n$28,993\n$2,900\n$2,900\n\nCorporation J files on a separate basis and properly\nelects to use the 50% allotment method. To compute its PNOLC subtraction pool, Corporation J first multiplies its UNOL by its base year BAP and base year tax\nrate ($16,000 x 9.750% x 7.1%). The result of $111 is divided by the 6.5%\nconversion percentage to arrive at a PNOLC subtraction pool of $1,704. Since\n\nCorporation J properly elected to use the 50% allotment method, its PNOLC\nsubtraction pool is multiplied by 50% to determine its tax period PNOLC\nsubtraction allotment of $852 for the first 2015 taxable year. In the first\n2015 taxable year, the PNOLC subtraction available for use is $852, which is\nequal to its tax period PNOLC subtraction allotment for that year. Corporation\nJ is able to use the entire PNOLC subtraction available for use so there is no\ncarryforward of PNOLC subtraction from the first 2015 taxable year.

However, if\n\nCorporation J properly revokes such election in accordance with the rules in\nthis Subpart, it would then use the 10% allotment method in the 2016 taxable\nyear. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
