  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 522.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Social\n\nSecurity Administration is a Federal government agency that administers two\nmajor benefit programs. The largest of these programs is the Retirement, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program (Social Security). The other is the\n\nSupplemental Security Income (SSI) program. (b) The Social Security program protects\nemployees and their families from a loss of earnings because of retirement, death, or disability. Social Security benefits are based on the earnings of an\nemployee who has paid into the system by paying Federal Insurance Contributions\n\nAct tax for a specified period of time. An employee, or his or her family, can\nreceive Social Security benefits based on retirement, disability, or death. (c) The SSI program is a federal\nincome maintenance program for aged, blind, and disabled persons with little or\nno income or resources. To receive SSI payments, a person must be age 65 or\nolder, blind or disabled and must have limited income and resources. (d) The Veterans Administration is a Federal\ngovernment agency that administers benefit programs for veterans. (e) The Social Security Administration\n\nRepresentative Payee Payment Program and the Veterans Administration provide\nassistance to persons who are unable to manage their federal benefits, permitting payment of the benefits to designated fiduciaries, referred to as\n\"representative payees\" by the SSA and as \"fiduciaries\" by the Veterans\n\nAdministration, who receive and manage payments on behalf of beneficiaries. Other state and federal benefit programs may approve similar arrangements to\nassist beneficiaries who are not capable of handling their own\nbenefits. (f) In some cases, facility directors who serve as representative payees may receive lump sum\nretroactive benefits on behalf of a beneficiary; in other cases, facility\ndirectors may learn about a windfall payment due to an individual who is\nreceiving services from the facility. In both situations, the payments may, in\ncombination with other resources of the individual, render the individual\nineligible for government benefits on which the individual relies or plans to\nrely upon discharge from the facility. In these cases, a Medicaid exception\ntrust or similar device may provide a mechanism to preserve the assets for the\nbenefit of the individual without rendering the individual ineligible for the\nneeded benefits. (g) The purpose of\nthis regulation is to implement the provisions of Mental Hygiene Law Section\n33.07(e) regarding the management and protection of monthly benefits and\nretroactive awards received by facility directors in the capacity of\nrepresentative payee; the use of Medicaid exception trusts, including special\nneeds trusts and similar devices; notice to qualified persons as defined by\n\nMental Hygiene Law 33.16 regarding the intent of a facility director to apply\nto be an individual's representative payee; and the appropriate establishment\nand maintenance of a discharge account for future needs of individuals for whom\ndirectors serve as fiduciaries.
