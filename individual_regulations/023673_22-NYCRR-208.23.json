  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 208.23 - Call of reserve, ready and general calendars\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Reserve calendars. At such times as\nthe Chief Administrator of the Courts shall prescribe, there shall be a call of\nactions on the reserve calendars in sequence and in sufficient number to insure\na steady supply of cases to the ready calendar. When such a call is held, the\nactions thereon, if marked \"ready,\" shall be passed and subsequently added to\nthe ready calendar, or may be marked \"disposed\" or stricken from the calendar, as may be appropriate. (b) Ready calendars. (1)\n\nThe ready calendars shall be called\nat such time and in such parts as the Chief Administrator shall direct. Actions\nshall be called in order and shall be announced \"ready,\" \"ready subject to\nengagement,\" or \"disposed.\" If any party does not so respond, the calendar\njudge shall treat the action as in default, unless for good cause shown, arising after the action appeared on the ready calendar and not reasonably\ndiscoverable or foreseeable, the judge shall direct that the action be held on\nthe ready calendar for a period not to exceed 10 days. If the inability to\nproceed to trial is expected to exceed 10 days, the action shall be returned to\nthe reserve calendar or stricken from the calendar as circumstances warrant, unless, for good cause shown, the court on application grants an\nadjournment. (2)\n\nActions announced \"ready\" on the call of the calendar shall be assigned in\norder to the available trial parts. Jury actions will be sent out for jury\nselection if a jury trial part is available, or scheduled for jury selection at\nthe opening of court on the next court day or as soon as practicable\nthereafter. Subject to the provisions of section\n208.25\nof this Part, no delay will\nbe permitted in selection of a jury, and failure of counsel to proceed as\ndirected or to appear promptly at the directed time on the specified court day\nwill be treated as a calendar default. (3)\n\nThe actions on the ready calendar\nmust be answered by or on behalf of the trial counsel each day the calendar is\ncalled, unless otherwise ordered by the calendar judge, or unless trial counsel\nalready has demonstrated an engagement during one or more days. The calendar\njudge may discontinue the call of the ready calendar when sufficient ready\ncases have been identified to fill all trial parts available on the day of the\ncall and which are expected to become available on the next court\nday. (4)\n\nWhen an\naction has been announced \"ready\" but no part is immediately available, counsel\nmay arrange with the calendar judge to be summoned by telephone, provided they\nagree to hold themselves available and to appear on one hour's notice or at\nsuch other time as the court may order at the time and part assigned for the\ntrial. (c) General calendar. At such time or times and in such manner as the Chief\n\nAdministrator may direct, a call shall be made of all actions on the general\ncalendar not reached on a ready calendar.
