  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 375-2.7 - Significant threat and registry determinations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Significant threat. (1)\n\nThe commissioner may find that\ncontaminants disposed at a site constitute a significant threat to public\nhealth or the environment if, after reviewing the available evidence and\nconsidering the factors the commissioner deems relevant set forth in this\nsection, the commissioner determines that the contaminants disposed at the site\nor coming from the site result in, or are reasonably foreseeable to result in, any of the following: (i) a significant\nadverse impact upon endangered species, threatened species, or species of\nconcern, as defined in section\n182.2\nof this Title; or\n(ii)\na significant adverse impact upon\nprotected streams and navigable waters as defined in section\n608.1\nof this Title, or tidal\nwetlands as defined in section\n661.4\n(hh)\nof this\n\nTitle, or freshwater wetlands as defined in section\n663.2\n(p) of this\n\nTitle or significant fish and wildlife habitat areas as defined in section\n602.5(a)\nof 19\nNYCRR; or\n(iii)\na bioaccumulation\nof contaminants in flora or fauna to a level that causes, or that materially\ncontributes to, significant adverse ecotoxicological effects in flora or fauna\nor leads, or materially contributes, to the need to recommend that human\nconsumption be limited; or\n(iv)\ncontaminant levels that cause significant adverse acute or chronic effects to\nfish, shellfish, crustacea, and wildlife; or\n(v) a significant adverse impact to the\nenvironment due to a fire, spill, explosion, or similar incident or a reaction\nthat generates toxic gases, vapors, fumes, mists, or dusts; or\n(vi)\na significant adverse impact to public\nhealth, where the site is near residences, recreational facilities, public\nbuildings or property, school facilities, places of work or worship, or other\nareas where individuals or water supplies may be present, and the New York\n\nState Department of Health has determined that the presence of contaminants on\nsuch site pose a significantly increased risk to the public health. (2)\n\nThe commissioner may also find\nthat contaminants disposed at a site constitute a significant threat to the\nenvironment if, after reviewing the available evidence and considering the\nfactors the commissioner deems relevant set forth in this subdivision, the\ncommissioner determines that the contaminants disposed at the site or coming\nfrom the site result in, or are reasonably foreseeable to result in, significant environmental damage. (3)\n\nIn making a finding under this\nsubdivision as to whether a significant threat to the environment exists, the\ncommissioner may take into account any or all of the following factors, as may\nbe appropriate under the circumstances of the particular situation: (i) all data and information related to the\nfactors, individually or in combination, set forth in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision; (ii)\nthe duration, areal extent, or magnitude of severity of the environmental damage that may\nresult from a release of contaminants; (iii)\ntype, mobility, toxicity, quantity, bioaccumulation, and persistence of contaminants present at the site; (iv)\nmanner of disposal of the\ncontaminants; (v) nature of soils\nand bedrock at and near the site; (vi)\ngroundwater hydrology at and near the\nsite; (vii)\nlocation, nature, and\nsize of surface waters at and near the site; (viii)\nlevels of contaminants in groundwater, surface water, sediments, air, soil vapor and soils at and near the site and\nareas known to be directly affected or contaminated by waste from the site, including, but not limited to, contravention of: surface water and groundwater\nquality standards set forth in Part 703 of this Title and drinking water\nstandards set forth in Subpart 5-1 and Part 170 of 10 NYCRR; (ix)\nproximity of the site to residences, recreational facilities, public buildings or property, school facilities, places of work or worship, and other areas where individuals may be\npresent; (x) the extent to which\ncontaminants and/or contaminant constituents have migrated or are reasonably\nanticipated to migrate from the site; (xi)\nthe proximity of the site to areas of\ncritical environmental concern (such as, wetlands or aquifers); (xii)\nthe potential for wildlife or aquatic\nlife exposure that could cause an increase in morbidity or mortality of\nsame; (xiii)\nthe integrity of the\nmechanism, if any, that may be containing the contaminants to assess the\nprobability of a release of the contaminants into the environment; and\n(xiv)\nthe climatic and weather\nconditions at and in the vicinity of the site. (4)\n\nThe mere presence of contaminants at a\nsite or in the environment is not a sufficient basis for a finding that\ncontaminants disposed at a site constitute a significant threat to the\nenvironment. (5)\n\nIn making a\nfinding under ECL 27-1313(3)(b)(ii) that a significant threat to the\nenvironment presents an imminent danger of causing irreversible or irreparable\nenvironmental damage, the commissioner must first find that: (i) the contaminants disposed at the site\nconstitute a significant threat to the environment; (ii)\nthere is insufficient time within which\nto start and complete all administrative procedures to establish an identified\nresponsible party's liability to devise and implement a program for the site, and to start and complete all measures necessary to contain, alleviate, or end\nthe threat to life or health or to the environment sought to be averted, including (if the department, in its discretion, believes it to be\ncost-effective) the development and implementation of a remedial program; and\n(iii)\nthe nature of the\nsignificant environmental damage reasonably foreseeable to occur if no action\nwere to be taken to avert a release or further release of contaminants into the\nenvironment is such, with respect to the component of the environment\nreasonably foreseeable to be adversely affected, either as to be of long\nduration; or that the component of the environment reasonably foreseeable to be\naffected cannot be fully restored to pre-release conditions. (6)\n\nIn making a finding under ECL\n27-1313(3)(b)(ii) that a significant threat to the environment is causing\nirreversible or irreparable environmental damage, the commissioner must first\nfind that: (i) significant environmental\ndamage has occurred; and\n(ii)\nthe\nnature of that environmental damage is such, with respect to the component of\nthe environment adversely affected, either as to be of long duration; or that\nthe component of the environment affected cannot be fully restored to\npre-release conditions. (7)\n\nIn making a finding under ECL\n27-1313(3)(b)(iii) that the significant threat to the environment posed by\ncontaminants disposed at a site makes it prejudicial to the public interest to\ndelay action until a proceeding can be held as set forth in ECL article 27, title 13, the commissioner must determine either that further environmental\ndamage is reasonably anticipated to result during such a hearing; or that, if\nenvironmental damage has not yet occurred, such is reasonably anticipated to\noccur during the pendency of the proceeding. (b) Site classification. (1)\n\nThe department shall maintain and make\navailable for public inspection a Registry of inactive hazardous waste disposal\nsites, in accordance with ECL 27-1305. The department will include information\non such Registry, including but not limited to, the site description, land use, acreage, and contaminants disposed. (2)\n\nThe Registry maintained by the department\nmust include all sites, except as provided in subdivision (c) of this section, known to the department at which contaminants, as defined in section\n375-2.2\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart have been confirmed to have been disposed in an amount that: (i) presently constitutes a significant\nthreat to public health or the environment, as described in subdivision (a) of\nthis section; or\n(ii)\nis reasonably\nforeseeable to constitute a significant threat to public health or the\nenvironment. (3)\n\nThe\ndepartment will, based upon the information available, classify sites according\nto the following criteria: (i) a class \"1\"\nsite is one at which: (a) contamination\nconstitutes a significant threat to public health or the environment; and\n(b) the significant threat to\npublic health or environment is causing, or presents an imminent danger of\ncausing, either irreversible or irreparable damage to the environment\n(ii)\na class \"2\" site is one at\nwhich contamination constitutes a significant threat to public health or the\nenvironment, as described in subdivision (a) of this section; (iii)\na class \"3\" site is one at which\ncontamination does not presently, constitute a significant threat to public\nhealth or the environment, as described in subdivision (a) of this\nsection; (iv)\na class \"4\" site is\none that has been properly closed but that requires continued site management, consisting of operation, maintenance, and monitoring; (v) a class \"5\" site is one that has been\nproperly closed and requires no further action. (4)\n\nThe department will investigate such\nareas or structures which it has reason to believe may need to be included in\nthe Registry and may establish an administrative category for such areas or\nstructures. (5)\n\nThe Registry is\ninformational in nature, and a site is not required to be on the Registry to\nconfer jurisdiction for action by the department according to statute or its\nimplementing regulations. (6)\n\nWhen\nfinal decisions concerning an initial site listing or classification are made, the department shall provide notice: (i) to\nthe owner of the site or an area of the site by certified mail, 15 days prior\nto public noticing such listing decision; and\n(ii)\nto the site contact list, in a timely\nmanner, after the listing decision is complete or, if a site contact list has\nnot been developed, by publication in a local newspaper, as well as notice to\nthe adjacent property owners, the chief executive officer of the city, town or\nvillage and the public water supplier, if any, in which the site is\nlocated. (7)\n\nAny person\nmay provide to the department, and the department shall consider, information\nrelevant to a site listed in the Registry or to an area or structure which may\nneed to be included in the registry. (8)\n\nIn classifying the site, the department\nmay: (i) disregard any amelioration of\nconditions at such site accomplished by the interim remedial measure unless the\ninterim remedial measure achieves the goal of the remedial program for such\nsite as described in subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section; and\n(ii)\nbase its determination upon facts and\ncircumstances known to the department to have existed at any time since the\ndate upon which such site was first listed in the registry that demonstrate the\nhighest relative priority of the need for action at such site; and\n(9)\n\nThe Registry may be updated by\nadding, deleting or reclassifying sites at any time, in accordance with this\nsection. (c) Site\nclassification deferral. (1)\n\nThe department\nwill defer the assessment or reassessment of sites for inclusion on the\nregistry which are the subject of an application for, negotiations for, or\nimplementation of: (i) a brownfield site\ncleanup agreement as set forth in ECL article 27, title 14; or\n(ii)\na State assistance contract for an\nenvironmental restoration project. (2)\n\nThe deferral will continue for so long as\nthe remedial party is in compliance with the terms of such agreement or State\nassistance contract. (3)\n\nThe\ndepartment shall assess or reassess such site upon termination of the agreement\nor State assistance contract. (d) Site reclassification or modification. (1)\n\nSite reclassification. The department may\nreview the classification of any site on the Registry at any time, but must\nreview the classification of each site on the Registry at least annually not\nlater than March 31st of each year. Notification of the reclassification of a\nsite will be provided in accordance with paragraph (b)(6) of this section. Site modification. The site boundary description in the\n\nRegistry will be revised by the department as appropriate based upon: (i) new information regarding the nature and\nextent of contamination present at the site; or\n(ii)\na portion of the site being remediated\nto allow the unrestricted use of that portion of the site. (e) Site delisting. (1)\n\nThe department will not delete any site\nfrom the Registry without providing, at least 60 days prior to the proposed\ndelisting, written notice to: (i) the owner\nor operator of the site; (ii)\nthe\npublic by publication of a notice in the Environmental Notice Bulletin and\nnewspaper of general circulation in the county in which the site is located; and\n(iii)\nthe site contact list. If\na site contact list has not been developed, the department will provide notice\nin accordance with section\n375-2.7\n(b)(6)(ii)\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nThe\ndepartment shall provide an opportunity for submittal of written comments on\nthe proposed delisting, of at least 30 days, and may provide an opportunity to\nprovide oral comments at a public meeting. (3)\n\nThe department shall make publicly\navailable a summary of any comments received. (4)\n\nThe department may delist a site if: (i) the site characterization or remedial\ninvestigation does not confirm that the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of\nthis section are satisfied; (ii)\na\ncertificate of completion has been issued and: (a) no environmental easement is required; or\n(b) an environmental easement\nand site management plan are required; and such documents only require\ninstitutional controls, with periodic certification, in the form of land use or\ngroundwater use restrictions. (5)\n\nSites which are delisted with\ninstitutional controls, as set forth in subparagraph (4)(ii) of this\nsubdivision, remain subject to the change of use provisions as set forth in\nsection\n375-1.11\n(d). (f) Petitions. (1)\n\nThe only person who has standing to make\na petition is: (i) a current owner; or\n(ii)\na responsible party by\nvirtue of being the current operator, or former owner or operator of a\nsite. (2)\n\nOnly the\nfollowing relief may be sought by a petition: (i) the deletion of a site from the\n\nRegistry; (ii)\nthe reclassification\nof a site to a different class on the Registry; or\n(iii)\nthe modification of any information\nconcerning a site on the Registry. (3)\n\nThe department will act only upon a\ncomplete petition. (i) To be complete, a\npetition must be submitted by a person identified in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision and must seek only relief identified in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision upon the basis of material factual allegations supported by proof\nthat tends to establish the right to the relief sought. (ii)\n\nIf the relief being sought is identified\nin subparagraph (2)(i) or (ii) of this subdivision, the proof must be in the\nform of an affidavit made by a person having direct knowledge of, or who is an\nexpert with regard to, the subject of the matters covered by the\npetition. (4)\nA petition\nis a written instrument that is filed with the department. (5)\n\nAfter receipt of a complete petition, the\ndepartment shall not later than: (i) 15\ncalendar days after receipt, publish notice thereof in the environmental notice\nbulletin, including a deadline not less than 15 nor more than 21 calendar days\nafter the date of publication for submission of written comments on the\npetition including any request for an administrative hearing; and\n(ii)\n45 calendar days after receipt of a\ncomplete petition, the department shall either: (a) determine to decide the petition\nsummarily; in such case, the department will proceed to decide the petition, and provide its decision to the petitioner not later than 30 calendar days\nafter such determination; or\n(b) if\na significant degree of public interest exists, determine that the petition\nshould not be decided summarily and that an administrative hearing should be\nconvened on a date not more than 90 calendar days after receipt of a complete\npetition; in such case, not sooner than 30 calendar days before such hearing, the department shall notify the petitioner and all other persons known by the\ndepartment to be proper petitioners of the department's intent to convene such\nhearing, publish notice thereof in the environmental notice bulletin, and\nrequire the petitioner to publish notice thereof at the petitioner's expense in\na newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the site is located. Such hearing shall be conducted on the petition and the response thereto by\nprogram staff, if any. The burden of proof in such hearing shall be on the\npetitioner. Upon the conclusion of such hearing, the designated appeal\nindividual will decide the petition, and provide the decision to the petitioner\nnot later than 30 calendar days after the conclusion. The decision of the\ndesignated appeal individual shall be the final agency action. The designated\nappeal individual to conduct such hearing is the assistant director of the\ndivision of environmental remediation, or such other individual as may be\ndesignated, with complete discretion to regulate the course of such hearing in\nany fair and impartial manner, including without limitation the discretion to\ndetermine the admissibility of evidence and to preclude or restrict oral\nargument. (6)\n\nThe department shall comply with the provisions under subdivision (b) or (c) of\nthis section prior to changing the site classification or listing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
