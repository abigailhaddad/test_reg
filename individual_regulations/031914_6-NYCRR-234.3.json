Tit. 6 § 234.3 - Control requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\nA packaging rotogravure, publication\nrotogravure, or flexographic printing process that uses ink, coating or\nadhesive containing VOC shall not operate if it: is located in a severe ozone\nnon-attainment area; has an annual potential to emit VOC of 25 tons per year or\nmore; or is located in a facility that has an annual potential to emit VOC of\n50 tons per year or more, unless the printing process uses one of the following\nstrategies to control VOCs: (i) ink, coating\nor adhesive with low VOC content equal to or less than: (a) 0.8 kilogram of VOC per kilogram of\nsolids as applied (0.8 kg VOC/ kg solids as applied); or\n(b) 0.16 kilogram of VOC per kilogram of ink, coating and adhesive as applied (0.16 kg VOC/ kg material as applied); VOC content limits can be met by averaging the VOC content\nof materials used on a single press (i.e., within a line); (ii)\na capture system and control\nequipment that provides for overall removal efficiency of at least: (a) 75 percent for a publication rotogravure\nprinting process, unless a higher overall removal efficiency is required by\nclause (e) of this subparagraph; (b) 65 percent for a printing process that\nwas first installed prior to March 14,1995, and that is controlled by an add-on\ncapture system and air cleaning equipment that was first installed prior to the\neffective date of this regulation; (c) 70 percent for a printing process that\nwas first installed prior to March 14,1995, and that is controlled by an add-on\nair capture system and air cleaning equipment that was first installed on or\nafter the effective date of this regulation; (d) 75 percent overall removal efficiency for\na printing process that was first installed on or after March 14,1995, and that\nis controlled by an add-on capture system and air cleaning equipment that was\nfirst installed prior to the effective date of this regulation; or\n(e) 80 percent for a printing process that\nwas first installed on or after March 14, 1995, and that is controlled by an\nadd-on capture system and air cleaning equipment that was first installed on or\nafter the effective date of this regulation. (2)\n\nRadiation cured material via ultra-violet\nlight or electron beam printing processes are not subject to the control\nrequirements of this subdivision. (b) (1)\nA\nheat-set web offset lithographic printing process or heat-set letterpress\nprinting process that uses ink, coating or adhesive containing VOC shall not\noperate if it: is located in a severe ozone non-attainment area; has an annual\npotential to emit VOC of 25 tons per year or more; or is located at a facility\nthat has an annual potential to emit VOC of 50 tons per year or more, unless\nthe control equipment provides for an: (i) overall removal efficiency of 90 percent or greater for control equipment that\nwas first installed prior to the effective date of this regulation; (ii)\noverall removal efficiency of 95 percent\nor greater for control equipment that was first installed on or after the\neffective date of this regulation; or\n(iii)\noutlet concentration of VOC from the\nemission control equipment equal to or less than 20 parts per million by volume\n(20 ppmv) as hexane on a dry basis. (2)\n\nThe following printing processes are not\nsubject to the control requirements of this subdivision: (i) heat-set web offset lithographic printing\nprocesses used for printing books; (ii)\nheat-set web offset lithographic\nprinting processes with a maximum web width of 22 inches; (iii)\ncold-set offset lithographic printing\nprocesses; (iv)\ncold-set\nletterpress printing processes; (v) sheet-fed or coldset web varnishes; and\n(vi)\nradiation cured material via\nultra-violet light or electron beam. (c) (1)\n\nAn\noffset lithographic or letterpress printing process that uses cleaning\nmaterials containing VOC shall not operate if it is located in a severe ozone\nnon-attainment area or at a facility with total actual annual VOC graphic arts\nemissions of three tons or more on a 12-month rolling basis, unless: (i) the cleaning material, as applied, contains less than 70 percent by weight VOC (70 percent by weight VOC); or\n(ii)\nthe cleaning material, as\napplied, has a composite vapor pressure of less than or equal to 10 millimeters\nmercury at 20 degrees Celsius (10 mm Hg at 20° C). (2)\n\nOne hundred and ten gallons of cleaning\nmaterial per year on a 12-month rolling basis are excluded from the\nrequirements of this subdivision provided that the use and quantity of the\ncleaning material excluded from the requirements are recorded in accordance\nwith section\n234.7\nof this Part. (d) (1)\n\nAn offset lithographic printing process\nthat uses fountain solutions containing VOC shall not operate if it is located\nin a severe ozone non-attainment area or is located at a facility with total\nactual annual VOC graphic arts emissions of three tons or more on a 12-month\nrolling basis, unless: (i) For heat-set web\noffset lithographic printing processes: (a) the fountain solution as applied contains no more than 1.6 percent alcohol by\nweight or equivalent; (b) the\nfountain solution as applied contains no more than three percent alcohol by\nweight when the fountain solution is refrigerated to less than 60° F or 15.5°\nC; or\n(c) the fountain solution as\napplied contains no more than a five percent alcohol substitute by weight and\nno alcohol. (ii)\n\nFor\nsheet-fed offset lithographic printing processes: (a) the fountain solution as applied contains\nno more than five percent alcohol by weight or equivalent; (b) the fountain solution as applied contains\nno more than 8.5 percent alcohol by weight when the fountain solution is\nrefrigerated to less than 60° F or 15.5° C; or\n(c) the fountain solution as applied contains\nno more than five percent alcohol substitute by weight and no\nalcohol. (iii)\n\nFor\ncold-set web offset lithographic printing presses the fountain solution as\napplied contains no more than five percent alcohol substitute by weight and no\nalcohol. (2)\n\nSheet-fed\noffset lithographic presses with a sheet size of 11 inches by 17 inches or\nsmaller or any press with a fountain solution reservoir of less than one gallon\nare not subject to the requirements of this subdivision. (e) (1)\nA\nscreen printing process that uses ink, coating or adhesive containing VOC shall\nnot operate if it is located in a severe ozone non-attainment area, or is\nlocated in a facility that has an annual potential to emit VOC of 50 tons per\nyear or more, unless the printing process uses one of the following strategies\nto control VOC: (i) the maximum permitted\npounds of VOC per gallon of ink, coating or adhesive, minus water and excluded\ncompounds, at application is: (a) 3.3 pounds\nas applied to paper, glass, metal, plastic, vinyl, reflective sheeting, textile/imprinted garments or pressure sensitive decals; or\n(b) 5 pounds as applied for\nserigraph; (ii)\na\ncapture system and control equipment that provides a minimum overall removal\nefficiency of 80 percent. (2)\n\nScreen printing ink, coating or adhesive\nwhich is applied by a hand-held squeegee (a squeegee that is not propelled\nthrough the use of mechanical conveyance and is not an integral part of the\nscreen printing process) are not subject to the control requirements of this\nsubdivision. (f) The\ndepartment may allow printing processes to operate with a lesser degree of\ncontrol than is required by this section provided that a process specific\nreasonably available control technology (RACT) demonstration has been made to\nthe satisfaction of the department. Such process specific RACT demonstrations\nwill be submitted by the department to the United States Environmental\n\nProtection Agency as a revision to the State Implementation Plan and must\naddress the technical and economic feasibility of using: (1)\nlow VOC content ink, coating or\nadhesive; (2)\ndemonstrated and\nproven emission control technologies that will achieve the required overall\nremoval efficiency as required by this section; (3)\ndemonstrated and proven emission control\ntechnologies that will achieve a degree of overall removal efficiency less than\nrequired by this section; and\n(4)\ndemonstrated and proven production modifications methods that will result in\nreal, documented, and enforceable reductions in the VOC emissions from the\nprinting process. (g) Facilities with printing processes subject to this Part with an annual\npotential to emit less than five tons of VOC are only required to comply with\nparagraphs (f)(1) and (4) of this section in order to demonstrate that a lesser\ndegree of control is RACT for these processes. (h) For printing processes subject to this\n\nPart, the department may allow sources that use control equipment with natural\ngas fired afterburners to shut down the natural gas fired afterburners from\n\nNovember 1st through March 31st for the purposes of natural gas conservation, provided that the commissioner has determined that this action will not\njeopardize air quality.
