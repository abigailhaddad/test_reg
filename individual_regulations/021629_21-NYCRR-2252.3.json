(e) Funds available to pay interest\npenalties. The agency will pay penalties with monies from: (1)\nproceeds received by or on behalf of the\nagency under the terms of bond resolutions of the agency, which proceeds are\nnot otherwise pledged to secure the payment of bonds; and\n(2)\nproceeds received by or on behalf of the\nagency under the terms of Public Authorities Law, section 2425 et seq., which\nproceeds are not otherwise restricted by the provisions of such\nstatute.

If the\nagency fails to provide reasonable grounds for its contentions, the date by\nwhich contract payment shall be made is calculated from the date of receipt of\nan invoice. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
