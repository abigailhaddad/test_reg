  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1632.7 - Implementation of recommendations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prior to March 31, 1984, each authority shall certify to the bureau of\nmanagement of the division that all energy conservation measures recommended in\nthe energy audit report submitted pursuant to this Part, which have a simple\npayback period of 12 months or less, have been implemented. Such certification\nshall indicate each energy conservation measure recommended by the energy audit\nand completed by the authority. (b) An authority may request a waiver of the requirement of subdivision (a) of this\nsection, provided that an energy audit report is filed as required by this Part\nand the request is made at the same time the report is filed. (c) The only condition for consideration of a\nwaiver of the implementation schedule is that the authority cannot implement\nthe identified energy conservation measures by March 31, 1984, given the\nprojected rent revenues and other monies available to the authority from\nreserve funds, loans or grants from the State or Federal governments or any\nother source. The waiver request must justify why implementation of the\nidentified energy conservation measures is not financially feasible, despite\nthe simple payback of 12 months or less, and shall include appropriate\ndocumentation. In no case shall no-cost operating and maintenance items be\nconsidered for a waiver. (d) Each\nrequest for a waiver of the implementation schedule shall be considered on a\ncase-by-case basis. In reviewing such requests, the division will consider all\nfactors affecting the fiscal condition of the authority, including, but not\nlimited to, the following: current and projected income, from rents and other\nsources; current and projected expenses, including fuel and utility expenses; accounts payable and receivable; status of reserve funds and other investments; ability to obtain conventional and subsidized financing or grants; the\nimplementation of other energy conservation measures; and other projected\ncapital improvements. (e) If the\nrequest for a waiver of the implementation schedule is not approved within 60\ndays of the date the request is made, the waiver request shall be deemed to be\ndenied. (f) If the division grants\na waiver from the implementation date of March 31, 1984, a new schedule shall\nbe prescribed by the division to provide for implementation of the identified\nenergy conservation measures. The division may require that any monies\nwithdrawn from the reserve fund to pay for energy conservation measures not\nconsidered to be eligible replacement reserve expenditures be returned to the\nreserve fund in accordance with a schedule which reflects the payback\nperiod.
