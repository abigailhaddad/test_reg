Tit. 12 § 317.20 - Insolvent; assessments; termination and dissolution of the group\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Insolvent, in\nthe context of a determinati on by the Chair, or his or her designee, to levy\nan assessment pursuant to the provi- sions of Workers' Compensation Law section\n50(5)(g), shall mean the inability of a private group self-insurer, to pay its\noutstanding lawful obligations under the Workers' Compensation Law as they\nmature in the regular course of business, as may be shown by: (1)\nthe self-insurer being under-funded as\ndefined in Worker s' Compensation Law, section 50 (3-a); and\n(2)\nthe sum of the self-insurer's assets, as\ndefined by section\n317.2\n(n) of this\n\nPart, plus the available security deposit held by the Chair pursuant to\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law, section 50(3-a) and section\n317.5\nof this Part, being less\nthan the total cost of all of the self-insure rs anticipated workers'\ncompensation liabilities, as defined by section 31 7.2(o) of this Part, that\nwill accrue within the succeeding six months. (b) The Chair shall levy an assessment\nagainst all private gr oup self- insurers, pursuant to Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw, section 50(5)(g), when- ever he or she, or his or her designee, determines\nthat workers' compensa- tion benefits may be unpaid by reason of the default of\nan insolvent private group self-insurer as defined in subdivision (a) of this\nsection. (c) The group shall\ncontinue for such time as may be necessary to accomplish the purpose for which\nit was created, and so long as all requirements to maintain auth orization as\nset forth in this Part continue to be met. Upon termination of the group's\nstatus as a group self-insurer, the group will continue to ad minister the\nworkers' compensation liabilities incurred by the group. Such a group shall be\ndesignated terminated\n(1)\n\nIn the event a\nterminated group is deemed underfunded by t he Chair, the group remains subject\nto provisions of this Part r elative to underfunded groups. In connection\ntherewith the group may be required to levy an assessment upon the group\nmembers as part of an overall plan of dissolution designed to extinguish all of\nthe group's accru ed liabilities. Such plan should contemplate the execution of\nan assumption of workers' compensation liability insurance policy securing the\ngrou p's contingent and future liability arising out of prior\nworkers'compensation claims. (2)\n\nAs part of a plan of dissolution a terminated group may apply to the Chair for\nfinancial assistance in meeting any unfunded claims obliga- tions as defined in\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law section 50 (3-a). The unfunded claims liabilities set\nforth in such plan shall be quantified based upon the quoted price for an\nassumption of liability policy issued by an in- surance carrier authorized to\nexecute same. In no event shall the Chair be required to provide any group\nqualifying under this section more than forty percent of the cost of an\nassumption of workers' compen sation li- ability policy premium nor more than\nfifty million dollars regardless of the percentage of the assumption of\nworkers' compensation liab ility policy premium. Subject to this maximum\nthreshold the Chair, in his or her discre- tion, may supply funding to the\ngroup in the amount of such unf unded claims obligations provided the following\ncriteria have be en met by the group: (i) The\ngroup has submitted a dissolution plan setting forth the manner in which the\ngroup shall wind down all of its remaining obliga- tions and operations\nincluding, but not limited to, the execution of an as- sumption of\nworkers'compensation liability insurance policy, the issuance of releases of\njoint and several liability and/or the return of funds to the employer members\nof the group who supply the agreements set f orth in paragraph three below. Said plan shall include the retainer of independent legal counsel for such\npurpose and shall, to the extent that t he Board requires additional funds to\nfully recoup any financial assistance provided hereunder, provide for the\nremittance of funds from the group to the Board, from the members of the group\nthat do not supply the agreement s referenced in paragraph three below. The\n\nChair shall review said plan for reasonableness and approve said plan where\nappropriate; and\n(ii)\n\nThe group\nhas levied an assessment on all of the group's members in an amount sufficient\nto discharge the full value of the group's unfunded claims liability and all\nother remaining liabilities of the group. (3)\n\nIn the event that a terminated group\nmeets the terms and co ndi- tions enumerated in paragraph two above, the group\nshall pro vide, in a form acceptable to the Chair, signed and notarized\nrepayment agreements and confessions of judgment in favor of the workers'\ncompensation board from the former members of the group in the aggregate amount\no f the funds sought by the group. In connection therewith, if deeme d\nnecessary by the Chair, the group shall reconcile the previously levied\nassessment to account for any members of the group that have been deemed una\nble to contribute to the group's liabilities and/or otherwise par ticipate in\nthe plan of dissolution. (4)\n\nUpon\nthe receipt and approval of agreements referenced a bove, the Chair shall use\nreasonable efforts to facilitate the group's execution of an assumption of\nliability policy, including, where approp riate, releasing the security held by\nthe Chair on behalf of the group in furtherance of the execution of the\nassumption of liability policy and providi ng the funding referenced in\nparagraph two above to the assumption of liabi lity policy carrier. In\nconnection therewith, the group shall remain li able to provide all additional\nfunding for the execution of the assumption of liability policy including but\nnot limited to all required premium surcharges as set forth in Workers'\nCompensation Law section 50 (3-a)(7)(a). In the ev ent that the assumption of\nliability policy is ultimately disapproved by the superinten- dent of the\ndepartment of financial services or is not execute d for any other reason, the\n\nChair shall be under no obligation to provi de funding assistance to the\nterminated group and shall retain the security held by the Chair on behalf of\nthe group, and the repayment agreements an d confes- sions of judgment\nreferenced in paragraph (3) above shall be deemed void and\nunenforceable. (d) Upon\nfailure on the part of the group to properly administer such liabilities, the\n\nChair shall assume the administration and final distribution of the group's\nassets and liabilities.
