Tit. 1 § 185.10 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Mature means\nthat the apples have reached the stage of development which will insure the\nproper completion of the ripening process. Before a mature apple becomes\noverripe it will show varying degrees of firmness, depending upon the stage of\nthe ripening process. The following terms are used for describing different\nstages of firmness of apples: (1)\n\nHard means\napples with a tenacious flesh and starchy flavor. (2)\n\nFirm means apples with a tenacious flesh\nbut which are becoming crisp with a slight starchy flavor, except the Delicious\nvariety. (3)\n\nFirm ripe means apples\nwith crisp flesh except that the flesh of the Gano, Ben Davis, and Rome Beauty\nvarieties may be slightly mealy. (4)\n\nRipe means apples with mealy flesh and\nsoon to become soft for the variety. (b) Overripe means apples which are dead\nripe, with flesh very mealy or soft, and past commercial utility. (c) Carefully hand-picked means that the\napples do not show evidence of rough handling or of having been on the\nground. (d) Clean means that the\napples are free from excessive dirt, dust, spray residue and other foreign\nmaterial. (e) Fairly well formed\nmeans that the apple may be slightly abnormal in shape but not to an extent\nwhich detracts materially from its appearance. (f) Injury means any specific defect defined\nin this section; or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these\ndefects, any other defect, or any combination of defects, which more than\nslightly detracts from the appearance, or the edible or shipping quality of the\napple. The following specific defects shall be considered as injury: (1)\n\nRusseting in the stem cavity or calyx\nbasin which cannot be seen when the apple is placed stem end or calyx end down\non a flat surface shall not be considered in determining whether or not an\napple is injured by russeting. Smooth net-like russeting outside of the stem\ncavity or calyx basin shall be considered as injury when an aggregate area of\nmore than 10 per cent of the surface is covered, and the color of the russeting\nshows no very pronounced contrast with the background color of the apple, or\nlesser amounts of more conspicuous net-like russeting when the appearance is\naffected to a greater extent than the above amount permitted. (2)\n\nSunburn or sprayburn, when the discolored\narea does not blend into the normal color of the fruit. (3)\n\nDark brown or black limb rubs which\naffect a total area of more than one-fourth inch in diameter, except that light\nbrown limb rubs of a russet character shall be considered under the definition\nof injury by russeting. [FN1]\n(4)\n\nHail marks, drought spots, other similar depressions or scars: (i) when the skin is broken, whether healed\nor unhealed; (ii)\nwhen there is\nappreciable discoloration of the surface; (iii)\nwhen any surface indentation exceeds\none-sixteenth inch in depth; (iv)\nwhen any surface indentation exceeds one-eighth inch in diameter; or, (v) when the aggregate affected area of such\nspots exceeds one-half inch in diameter.[FN1]\n(5)\n\nDisease. (i) Cedar rust infection which affects a\ntotal area of more than three-sixteenths inch in diameter.1\n(ii)\n\nSooty blotch or fly speck which is\nthinly scattered over more than five per cent of the surface, or dark, heavily\nconcentrated spots which affect an area of more than one-fourth inch in\ndiameter.1\n(iii)\n\nRed skin spots\nwhich are thinly scattered over more than one-tenth of the surface, or dark, heavily concentrated spots which affect an area of more than one-fourth inch in\ndiameter.1\n(6)\n\nInsects. (i) Any healed sting or healed stings which\naffect a total area of more than one-eighth inch in diameter including any\nencircling discolored rings.1\n(ii)\n\nWorm holes. (g) Damage means any specific defect defined\nin this section; or an equally objectionable variation of any one of these\ndefects, any other defect, or any combination of defects, which materially\ndetracts from the appearance, or the edible or shipping quality of the apple. The following specific defects shall be considered as damage: (1)\n\nRusseting in the stem cavity or calyx\nbasin which cannot be seen when the apple is placed stem end or calyx end down\non a flat surface shall not be considered in determining whether or not an\napple is damaged by russeting, except that excessively rough or bark-like\nrusseting in the stem cavity or calyx basin shall be considered as damage when\nthe appearance of the apple is materially affected. The following types and\namounts of russeting outside of the stem cavity or calyx basin shall be\nconsidered as damage: (i) Russeting which is\nexcessively rough or Roxbury Russet and other similar varieties. (ii)\n\nSmooth net-like russeting, when an\naggregate area of more than 15 per cent of the surface is covered, and the\ncolor of the russeting shows no very pronounced contrast with the background\ncolor of the apple, or lesser amounts of more conspicuous net-like russeting\nwhen the appearance is affected to a greater extent than the above amount\npermitted. (iii)\n\nSmooth solid\nrusseting, when an aggregate area of more than five per cent of the surface is\ncovered, and the pattern and color of the russeting shows no very pronounced\ncontrast with the background color of the apple, or lesser amounts of more\nconspicuous solid russeting when the appearance is affected to a greater extent\nthan the above amount permitted. (iv)\n\nSlightly rough russeting which covers an\naggregate area of more than one-half inch in diameter.1\n(v) Rough russeting which covers an aggregate\narea of more than one-fourth inch in diameter.1\n(2)\n\nSunburn or sprayburn which has caused\nblistering or cracking of the skin, or when the discolored area does not blend\ninto the normal color of the fruit unless the injury can be classed as\nrusseting. (3)\n\nLimb rubs which\naffect a total area of more than one-half inch in diameter, except that light\nbrown limb rubs of a russet character shall be considered under the definition\nof damage by russeting.[FN1]\n(4)\n\nHail marks, drought spots, other similar depressions or scars: (i) when any unhealed mark is\npresent; (ii)\nwhen any surface\nindentation exceeds one-eighth inch in depth; (iii)\nwhen the skin has not been broken and\nthe aggregate affected area one-half inch in diameter;1 or, (iv)\nwhen the skin has been broken and well\nhealed, and the aggregate affected area exceeds one-fourth inch in\ndiameter.1\n(5)\n\nStem or\ncalyx cracks which are not well healed, or well healed stem or calyx cracks\nwhich exceed an aggregate length of one-fourth inch. (6)\n\nInvisible water core existing around the\ncore and extending to water core in the vascular bundles; or surrounding the\nvascular bundles when the affected areas surrounding three or more vascular\nbundles meet or coalesce; or existing in more than slight degree outside the\ncircular area formed by the vascular bundles. (7)\n\nDisease. (i) Scab spots which affect a total area of\nmore than one-fourth inch in diameter.1\n(ii)\n\nCedar rust infection which affects a\ntotal area of more than one-fourth inch in diameter.1\n(iii)\n\nSooty blotch or fly speck which is\nthinly scattered over more than one tenth of the surface, or dark, heavily\nconcentrated spots which affect an area of more than one-half inch in\ndiameter.1\n(iv)\n\nRed skin spots\nwhich are thinly scattered over more than one tenth of the surface, or dark, heavily concentrated spots which affect an area of more than one-half inch in\ndiameter.1\n(8)\n\nInsects. (i) Any healed sting or healed stings which\naffect a total area of more than three-sixteenths inch in diameter including\nany encircling discolored rings.1\n(ii)\n\nWorm holes. (h) Serious damage means any\ndefect defined in this section; or an equally objectionable variation of any\none of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of defects which\nseriously detracts from the appearance, or the edible or shipping quality of\nthe apple. The following specific defects shall be considered as serious\ndamage: (1)\n\nThe following types and amounts\nof russeting shall be considered as serious damage: (i) Smooth solid russeting, when more than\none half of the surface in the aggregate is covered, including any russeting in\nthe stem cavity or calyx basin or slightly rough, or excessively rough or\nbark-like russeting which detracts from the appearance of the fruit to a\ngreater extent than the amount of smooth solid russeting permitted: provided, that, any amount of russeting shall be permitted on Roxbury Russet and other\nsimilar varieties. (2)\n\nSunburn or sprayburn which seriously detracts from the appearance of the\nfruit. (3)\n\nLimb rubs which affect\nmore than one tenth of the surface in the aggregate. (4)\n\nHail marks, drought spots, or scars, if\nthey materially deform or disfigure the fruit, or if such defects affect more\nthan one tenth of the surface in the aggregate: provided, that, no hail marks\nwhich are unhealed shall be permitted and not more than an aggregate area of\none-half inch shall be allowed for well-healed hail marks where the skin has\nbeen broken.[FN1]\n(5)\n\nStem or calyx\ncracks which are not well healed, or well healed stem or calyx cracks which\nexceed an aggregate length of one-half inch. (6)\n\nVisible water core which affects an area\nof more than one-half inch in diameter.1\n(7)\n\nDisease.

(iv)\n\nRed skin spots which affect more than\none third of the surface. (v) Bitter pit and Jonathan spot which is thinly scattered over more than one tenth\nof the surface and does not materially deform or disfigure the fruit. (8)\n\nInsects. (i) Healed stings which affect a total area\nof more than one-fourth inch in diameter including any encircling discolored\nrings. 1\n(ii)\n\nWorm holes. (i) Seriously\ndeformed means that the apple is so badly misshapen that its appearance is\nseriously affected. (j) Diameter. When measuring for minimum size, diameter means the greatest dimension of the\napple measured at right angles to a line from stem to blossom end. When\nmeasuring for maximum size, diameter means the smallest dimension of the apple\ndetermined by passing the apple through a round opening in any position.
