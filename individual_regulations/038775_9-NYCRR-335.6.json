All\napplications are to be sent to the statewide SEFA council. Applications to a\nsingle campaign area will be forwarded by the statewide SEFA council, with a\nrequired date for committee action, to the local SEFA committee for that\ncampaign to determine approval or denial. On or before the required date for\naction, the local SEFA committee shall notify the statewide SEFA council of its\ndecisions and, if applicable, the reason for the denial. Decisions to deny\nparticipation shall be reviewed by the statewide SEFA council. Decisions to\napprove participation shall not be denied by the statewide SEFA council.

(2)\n\nThe statewide SEFA\ncouncil shall develop an application form for use by charitable organizations\nnot currently participating in a SEFA campaign.

As part of the\napplication process, an applicant shall at a minimum: (i) provide a completed signed copy of the\norganization's IRS form 990 with the application, regardless of whether or not\nthe Internal Revenue Service (IRS) requires the organization to file this form. IRS forms 990EZ, 990PF, and comparable forms are not acceptable substitutes. However, smaller organizations that file form 990EZ may submit the 990EZ with\npages 1 and 2 of the form 990 attached. The IRS form 990 and any annual\nfinancial statement filed with the Department of Law must cover the same fiscal\nperiod, and if revenue and expenses on the two documents differ, these amounts\nmust be reconciled in an accompanying statement signed by the certified public\naccountant who completed the annual financial statement. The IRS form 990 may\nnot be an initial return; (ii)\nprovide a computation of the percentage of total support and revenue spent on\nadministration and fundraising.
