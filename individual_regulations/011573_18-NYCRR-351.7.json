Supervisory approval must be based upon review of all available information\npertaining to eligibility and the amount of entitlement. It must include\napproval of decisions to deny public assistance as well as decisions to change\ngrants or to refer applicants or recipients for services. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
