  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-7.5 - Application of New York net capital losses\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this\n\nSubpart, the amount of New York net business capital loss and the amount of New\n\nYork net investment capital loss must be carried back to each of the 3 taxable\nyears immediately preceding the taxable year of each such loss and, to the\nextent that any capital loss remains, must be carried forward to the 5 taxable\nyears immediately succeeding the taxable year of each such loss, but only to\nthe extent that the amount of New York net business capital loss or New York\nnet investment capital loss does not increase or produce a net operating loss\nfor New York State purposes. New York net business capital loss must be carried\nback or forward in accordance with this Subpart to offset only New York\nbusiness capital gains in other taxable years, for New York State purposes. New\n\nYork net investment capital loss must be carried back and forward in accordance\nwith this Subpart to offset only New York investment capital gains in other\ntaxable years, for New York State purposes. (b) A New York net business capital loss or\n\nNew York net investment capital loss cannot be carried back to a taxable year\nbeginning before January 1, 2015. (c) Except as provided in subdivision (b) of\nthis section, a New York net business capital loss or New York net investment\ncapital loss is carried first to the earliest of the 3 taxable years\nimmediately preceding the tax year in which the loss was sustained. If such net\ncapital loss is not entirely used in that tax year, the remaining amount is\nthen carried to the second taxable year preceding the loss year, and any amount\nthereafter remaining is carried to the first taxable year immediately preceding\nthe tax year in which the net capital loss was sustained. Any unused amount\nafter the application of the carryback rules is then carried forward to the\nfirst 5 taxable years immediately succeeding the loss year. Such net capital\nloss is carried forward first to the taxable year immediately following the\nloss year and then to the next immediately succeeding taxable year or years\nuntil the loss is used up or the fifth taxable year following the loss year, whichever comes first. Any unused capital loss carryforward is forfeited after\nthe fifth taxable year following the loss year. (d) For purposes of determining the number of\ntax years to which a capital loss may be carried back or forward, the following\nyears are counted: (1)\na New York filing\nyear; (2)\na New York non-filing\nyear; (3)\na New York S filing\nyear; (4)\na non-captive REIT filing\nyear; (5)\na non-captive RIC filing\nyear; and\n(6)\na non-combinable\ncaptive insurance filing year. (e) A corporation that reports as part of a\nconsolidated group for Federal income tax purposes but on a separate basis for\npurposes of article 9-A must compute its New York net business capital loss and\n\nNew York net investment capital loss as if it is filing separately for Federal\nincome tax purposes. This requires such corporation, when computing its Federal\ntaxable income as if it had filed its Federal tax return on a separate basis, to also compute its Federal net capital gain or loss as if it had filed\nseparately for Federal income tax purposes. The corporation then computes its\n\nNew York net investment capital gain or loss and New York net business capital\ngain or loss in accordance with this Subpart. (f) In computing its tax bases, a New York\n\nState combined group is generally treated as a single corporation subject to\nthe same Federal income tax limitations that would apply if such corporation\nhad filed for such taxable year on a consolidated Federal income tax return\nwith the members of the combined group. When applying this rule to the\ncomputation of combined business income, Federal taxable income must be\ncomputed as if all the corporations in the combined group had filed a Federal\nconsolidated return including such group members. When the New York State\ncombined group is comprised of corporations different than those that filed on\nthe same Federal consolidated return, a re-computation of Federal taxable\nincome is required and, as a result, a re-computation of Federal net capital\ngain or loss is required as if the Federal net capital gain or loss was\ncomputed by a Federal consolidated group comprised of the same members as the\n\nNew York State combined group. A New York State combined group must then, for\nthe purpose of computing its New York combined business income, compute its New\n\nYork net business capital loss and New York net investment capital loss, pursuant to this Subpart, as if all the corporations included in the combined\ngroup are a single corporation.
