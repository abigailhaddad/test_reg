PCI capable cardiac catheterization\nlaboratory centers must meet the following standards: (i) structure and service requirements: (a) PCI capable cardiac catheterization\nlaboratory centers must be appropriately staffed and equipped for diagnostic\nand therapeutic services including but not limited to diagnostic cardiac\ncatheterization and percutaneous coronary and other percutaneous\ninterventions; (b) PCI capable\ncardiac catheterization laboratory centers must maintain capabilities to\nperform emergency percutaneous coronary interventions including, but not\nlimited to percutaneous coronary intervention for the treatment of ST elevation\n\nMyocardial Infarction (STEMI) on a 24 hour a day, 365 days a year basis and\nmust be capable of assembling a dedicated team within 30 minutes of the\nactivation call to provide coronary interventions 24 hours a day and 365 days\neach year. Exception to this standard shall be made only for temporary and\nextenuating circumstances and when: (1)\nlocal\nemergency medical services have been notified and documentation is in place for\ntriaging patients in need of emergency PCI; and\n(2)\nthe Department of Health has been\nprovided with a specific description of the circumstances, documentation of the\nrevised triage arrangements and a timeline for return to the 24 hour provision\nof services, and has approved the arrangement. (c) the hospital must insure that once an\nambulance calls to indicate transport of an emergency cardiac patient, the PCI\nteam is immediately mobilized; (d) the hospital must effectively and efficiently identify patients in need of an\nemergency percutaneous coronary intervention and must transfer those patients\nrapidly (within 30 minutes) from the emergency department to the cardiac\nlaboratory; and\n(e) the hospital\nmust have a system documented and in place to ensure effective and efficient\nidentification and transfer of a patient from the cardiac laboratory to a\ncardiac surgical program either in the hospital or at another\nhospital. (ii)\nstaffing. (a) physicians shall all be board certified, or meet accepted equivalent training and experience for physicians in their\nrespective specialty and shall be appropriately credentialed and privileged as\nmembers of the medical staff and in sufficient numbers to meet the care needs\nof the patients; (b) a minimum of\nthree interventional cardiologists, at least one of whom dedicates the majority\nof his or her professional time at the facility, must be credentialed and\nprivileged on the medical staff to perform percutaneous coronary interventions. Each interventional cardiologist shall maintain sufficient volume on-site to\nmaintain familiarity with the laboratory and shall perform a minimum of 75\ntotal percutaneous coronary intervention cases per year of which 11 are\nemergency percutaneous coronary intervention cases, and not all 75 minimum\ncases or 11 minimum emergency cases must be performed at one site. Review by\nthe physician director shall be conducted and provided to the chief of service, hospital medical director and medical staff credentials committee for all\nphysicians whose volume falls below these minimum volumes to determine actions\ndeemed necessary; and\n(c) the PCI\ncapable cardiac catheterization laboratory center shall have a data manager who\nhas special training in the clinical criteria used in the PCI module of the\ncardiac reporting system as provided by the department or its designee, is\ndesignated and authorized by the hospital and shall work in collaboration with\nthe physician director to ensure accurate and timely reporting of cardiac\nreporting system data to the department. In addition to the data manager, relevant medical and administrative staff must be trained in the use of the\ncardiac reporting system and the specific data element definitions involved. For PCI capable cardiac catheterization laboratory centers that have a\nco-operated parent cardiac surgery center, responsibilities related to the\ncardiac reporting system may be performed by the cardiac surgery center on\nbehalf of the data manager of the PCI capable cardiac catheterization\nlaboratory center as long as all data is delineated at the facility\nlevel; (iii)\npatient\nselection criteria. PCI capable cardiac catheterization laboratory centers\nshall adopt criteria for appropriate coronary artery diagnostic and\ninterventional procedures in accordance with generally accepted standards for\ncardiac patients. For centers with no cardiac surgery on site and not\nco-operated with a New York State cardiac surgery center, patient selection\ncriteria shall be reviewed and approved annually by the affiliated sponsored\ncardiac surgery center in accordance with subparagraph (c)(8)(i) of this\nsection; (iv)\nminimum workload\nstandards. Each PCI capable cardiac catheterization laboratory center must\nmaintain a minimum volume of at least 36 emergency percutaneous coronary\nintervention cases per year. For hospitals that are part of a co-operated\narticle 28 network and multi-site facilities with more than one approved PCI\ncapable cardiac catheterization laboratory center, and for PCI capable cardiac\ncatheterization laboratory centers operating under a clinical sponsorship\nagreement pursuant to section\n709.14\n(d)(5)\nof\nthis Title, minimum volume standards for emergency PCI procedures are site\nspecific and may not be combined for purposes of achieving minimum workload\nstandards. (a) PCI capable cardiac\ncatheterization laboratory centers with an annual volume below 150 percutaneous\ncoronary intervention cases a year for two consecutive calendar years, or a\nvolume below 36 emergency percutaneous coronary intervention cases a year for\ntwo consecutive calendar years, must procure the services of an independent\nphysician consultant, acceptable to the department, who shall conduct an annual\nreview of the appropriateness and quality of the percutaneous coronary\nintervention cases performed at the facility and shall provide a copy of the\nfindings directly to the department. Findings will be used by the department to\ndetermine whether continued approval or withdrawal of approval best meets the\nneeds of the patients in the planning area. (v) PCI capable cardiac catheterization\nlaboratory centers with no cardiac surgery on-site must enter into a formal\nrelationship documented by a fully executed written agreement with a cardiac\nsurgery center meeting standards at subparagraph (c)(8)(i) of this\nsection. (3)\n\nDiagnostic\ncardiac catheterization services. No additional diagnostic cardiac\ncatheterization services shall be approved. Diagnostic cardiac catheterization\nservices hospitals are not approved to perform percutaneous coronary\nintervention or cardiac surgery, are subject to annual reviews of volume, appropriateness of cases and other quality indicators for diagnostic cardiac\ncatheterization, and must meet the following standards: (i) affiliation agreement. The hospital must\nenter into and maintain a fully executed written agreement with a cardiac\nsurgery center with demonstrated high volume and high quality interventional\ncardiac services (cardiac surgery and percutaneous coronary interventions). The\nagreement, must be approved by the commissioner, and must provide, at a\nminimum, for the standards at subparagraph (c)(8)(i) of this section. (ii)\n\nPatient selection criteria. Written\ncriteria shall be adopted by the diagnostic cardiac catheterization service\nhospital to be used as indications for coronary angiography and or other\ncardiac invasive diagnostic procedures and shall be available for review during\nsite visits. (iii)\nminimum workload\nstandards. There shall be sufficient utilization of a diagnostic cardiac\ncatheterization service to ensure both quality and economy of services, as\ndetermined by the commissioner. For hospitals that are part of an article 28\nnetwork and for multi-site facilities with more than one approved cardiac\ncatheterization laboratory center, minimum volume standards are site specific\nand may not be combined for purposes of achieving minimum workload standards. Any institution seeking to maintain approval shall present evidence that the\nannual minimum workload standards have been achieved and maintained. Diagnostic\ncardiac catheterization services shall achieve and maintain an annual minimum\nvolume of 200 angiographic diagnostic cardiac catheterization procedures within\ntwo years of initial approval. Such procedures include left and or right heart\ncatheterization with or without the use of contrast visualization and with or\nwithout coronary arteriograms, and such procedures exclude: (a) placement of permanent or temporary\npacemaker or automatic implantable cardioverter defibrillator (AICD); (b) any floating type catheter; (c) bundle of his study; (d) balloon septostomy; (e) radionuclide study; (f) right heart catheterization without\ncontrast visualization in adults; (g) placement of intra-aortic balloon pump; and\n(h) non-coronary\nstudies. (iv)\n\nWaiver of\nminimum workload standards. The commissioner may temporarily waive the workload\nrequirements upon a satisfactory showing by the hospital that the quality of\ncare provided is adequate as supported, at a minimum, by a review conducted by\nthe department of cases, outcome trends and appropriateness of care, and that: (a) there are extenuating circumstances\ntemporarily precluding compliance with the workload requirements; and\n(b) there is a documented unmet need in the\ncenter's geographical service area that cannot be met by existing PCI capable\ncardiac catheterization laboratory center laboratory centers. (4)\n\nPediatric cardiac\ncatheterization laboratory centers. In addition to the standards at paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision, pediatric cardiac catheterization; laboratory centers\nmust meet the following standards: (i) pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory centers are limited to hospitals\napproved to perform pediatric cardiac surgery and that meet standards at\nsubdivision (d) of this section; and\n(ii)\nduring any interventional pediatric\ncardiac catheterization procedure and for a clinically appropriate period of\ntime following such a procedure, a qualified pediatric cardiac surgeon must be\nimmediately available for consultation and available on-site within 30 minutes, when requested, to perform procedures as needed to meet the patient's\nneeds. (5)\n\nCardiac EP\nlaboratory programs. In addition to the standards at paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, cardiac EP laboratory programs must meet the following standards: (i) structure and service requirements: (a) cardiac electrophysiology laboratories\nmust be adequately staffed and equipped for providing intracardiac\nelectrophysiology procedures; (b) an ultrasound (echocardiographic) machine must be readily available to the\nlaboratory during all electrophysiology procedures; (c) the cardiac EP laboratory program must\nhave written protocols utilized for addressing complications including\ntamponade; and\n(d) cardiac EP\nlaboratory programs serving patients between the ages of 12 and 18 with adult\ncardiac surgery on site, but no pediatric cardiac surgery on site, must\nmaintain pediatric trained personnel. (ii)\nstaffing. Staffing for cardiac EP\nlaboratory programs shall include: (a) electrophysiologists, board certified or with separate equivalent training and\nexperience each of whom shall maintain an average annual volume of 50 adult\ncardiac electrophysiology procedures based on review of two years of cases, or\n20 pediatric cardiac electrophysiology procedures per year depending on the\npopulation served.
