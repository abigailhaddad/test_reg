  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 112.4 - Field standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nUnit for designation. An\nindividual tree, clone or stand of trees may be designated. A designation unit\nwill generally consist of an area not less than a quarter of an acre. A clear\nand distinct boundary line will be marked with paint between an area and its\nisolation strip. The outer boundary of the isolation strips shall be marked\nwith a contrasting color or symbol. (2)\n\nIsolation requirements. Except as\notherwise specified, an isolation strip of 400 feet is to be maintained around\na designated area. This zone shall be maintained free of off-type plants and\nother species which might cross-pollinate seed producing trees. (b) Specific requirements. (1)\n\nStands or trees will be evaluated for\ndesignation as either appropriate for the production of timber products, or\nhaving qualities believed to have special value for some other particular use, or both. Such special qualities as the trees or stands may have are to be\ncarefully described. (2)\n\nAll stands\nor trees which are to be designated for seed production shall be of seed\nbearing age. (3)\n\nSeed producing\nareas. A stand should consist of at least 20 trees of high general quality\ngrowing sufficiently close to one another that effective cross pollination can\nbe expected. For timber products production, only trees of average or above\nform, vigor and natural pruning, and average or below in branch size shall\nremain. (4)\n\nSeed orchards. The\nstand will be composed of at least 15 trees. The identity of each tree shall be\nknown and records of the ortet (or parentage in the case of seedling stock)\nshall be available for inspection. The arrangement shall be such as to maximize\ncross-pollination between clones. All clones in a seed orchard must be progeny\ntested and the tests approved by the certifying agency before superior seed can\nbe produced. The records of each progeny test shall be available to the agency\nand at its discretion it may refer them to proper authorities for evaluation. The field plots of the progeny tests must be maintained until such time as the\nrequirements of the certifying agency are satisfied. Prior to completion of progeny tests and qualification of\nsuperior seed, seed which is produced in seed orchards may be sold as select\nseed, provided that all ortets or individual trees are expected to eventually\nmeet the standards for \"elite trees.\"\n(5)\n\nElite trees (including varieties): (i) An elite tree must possess certain\ncharacteristics such as superior growth, intrinsic wood quality, distinctive\nfoliage color, etc. which can be described and must be capable of being\ndifferentiated from other trees of the same species on the same site. All trees\nmust be progeny tested before designation as elite trees. The progeny tests and\nrecords shall be handled as for seed orchard clones. (ii)\n\nEach tree shall be marked with a band of\npaint not less than 6 inches wide containing identifying numbers and/or\nletters. The records for each tree shall contain a complete description of the\ntree and a map showing its exact location. (iii)\n\nOpen pollinated seed may be certified\nselect if an isolation strip is maintained as prescribed. Controlled pollinated\nseed may be certified \"Superior\" provided the cross presented for certification\nhas been progeny tested and the tests approved by the certifying agency. Propagules from elite trees may be certified superior. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n112.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
