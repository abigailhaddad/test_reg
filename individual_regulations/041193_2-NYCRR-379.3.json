  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 379.3 - Internal Revenue Code 415 and cost-of-living adjustments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The defined benefit payable to a member\nof the Retirement System shall not exceed the applicable limits under Internal\n\nRevenue Code section 415(b), as periodically adjusted by the Secretary of the\n\nTreasury pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section 415(d). The limitation year\nis the fiscal year. This limit shall apply to a member who has had a severance\nfrom employment or, if earlier, an annuity starting date. Benefits that are\nsubject to Internal Revenue Code section 415(b) shall comply with the foregoing\nlimit in each year during which payments are made. The foregoing limit shall be\nadjusted pursuant to the requirements of code sections 415(b)(2)(C) and (D)\nrelating to the commencement of benefits at a date prior to age 62 or after age\n65, subject to other applicable rules under Internal Revenue Code section 415. No adjustment shall be required to a benefit subject to an automatic benefit\nincrease feature described in Treasury Regulation section 1.415(b) -1(c)(5). To\nthe extent that Internal Revenue Code section 415 and the Treasury Regulations\nthereunder require that an interest rate under Internal Revenue Code section\n417(e) apply, the applicable lookback month shall be the calendar month\npreceding the current month and the applicable stability period is one calendar\nmonth. (b) If a member is, or has\never been, a participant in another qualified defined benefit plan (without\nregard to whether the plan has been terminated) maintained by the member's\nemployer, as determined pursuant to Internal Revenue Code sections 414(b), 415(c), and 415, the sum of the participant's benefits payable annually in the\nform of a straight life annuity from all such plans may not exceed the limit\ndescribed in subdivision (a) of this section. Where the member's\nemployer-provided benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as\nof the same age) would exceed the limit described in subdivision (a) of this\nsection applicable at that age, the benefits accrued under all such other plans\nshall be reduced first in order to avoid exceeding the limit and only to the\nextent that the reduction under such other plans is insufficient to avoid\nexceeding the limit.
