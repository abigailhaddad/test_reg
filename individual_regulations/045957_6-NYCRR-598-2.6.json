  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 598-2.6 - Out-of-service underground tank systems and closure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Out-of-service UST systems. (1)\nA UST system is out of service if: (i) the facility owner (or their authorized\nrepresentative) takes the tank system out of service by submitting an\napplication to the department, in accordance with paragraph 1.14(a)(5) of this\n\nPart, indicating that the tank system is out of service; or\n(ii)\nthe tank system is no longer receiving\nor dispensing a hazardous substance, unless the tank system is used for standby\nstorage or is part of a closed-loop system. Records explaining why a tank\nsystem that no longer receives or dispenses hazardous substance is not out of\nservice, must be retained until the tank system is permanently closed and made\npart of the spill prevention report. Within 30 days after the tank system\nbecomes out of service, the facility owner (or their authorized representative)\nmust submit an application to the department, in accordance with paragraph\n1.14(a)(5) of this Part, indicating that the tank system is out of\nservice. (2)\n\nOut-of-service UST systems are still subject to all applicable requirements of\nthis Part, with the exception of periodic equipment\ntesting/monitoring/inspections, walkthrough inspections, and leak detection\nrequired under subdivisions\n2.2\n(c) through\n(f), and\n2.3\n(a) and (b)\nof\nthis Subpart if the UST system is empty. (A UST system is considered empty when\nall hazardous substance has been removed using commonly employed practices so\nthat no more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue remain in the UST\nsystem.)\n(i) The suspended requirements of\nsubdivisions\n2.2\n(c) through\n(f), and\n2.3\n(a) and (b)\nof\nthis Subpart must resume in accordance with the original schedule when the UST\nsystem is returned to service. However, if the UST system has been out of\nservice such that any of the next periodic testing/monitoring/inspections was\nnot conducted in accordance with the original schedule, the\ntesting/monitoring/inspection must be performed when the UST system is returned\nto service. (ii)\n\nFor UST systems\ntaken out of service due to repairs (in response to a leak), the repair and\nsubsequent testing requirements of subdivision\n2.2\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart must be successfully completed before the UST system is returned to\nservice. (3)\n\nWhen a UST\nsystem is out-of-service for 30 or more days, the UST system must meet the\nfollowing requirements: (i) The tank must be\nemptied so that no more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue remains. Any\nhazardous waste that is removed from the tank system must be disposed of in\naccordance with all applicable State, local and Federal requirements. Tanks\nmust be protected from floatation in accordance with generally accepted\nengineering practices; (ii)\n\nVent\nlines must be left open and functioning; and\n(iii)\n\nAll piping, manways, fill ports, gauge\nopenings, vapor returns, pump connections, and ancillary equipment must be\ncapped and secured. (4)\nUST systems that are out-of-service for more than one year must be permanently\nclosed if the tank system has not been protected from corrosion as required in\nclause 2.1(b)(1)(ii)('b') of this Subpart. The department may grant a time\nextension based on the findings of a site assessment performed by the owner or\noperator in accordance with subdivision (d) of this section. UST systems that\nare out-of-service for more than one year must be inspected or tested in\naccordance with paragraphs 2.3(c)(1) and 2.3(d)(2) of this Subpart and\ndetermined to be structurally sound and tight before being returned to\nservice. (b) Permanent\nclosure of tank systems. To permanently close a tank system, the tank system\nmust be removed from the ground or closed in place in accordance with paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision or undergo a change-in-service in accordance with\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. (1)\nA tank\nsystem must be removed from the ground or closed in-place in accordance with\nthe following: (i) At least 30 days before\npermanent closure, the facility owner (or their authorized representative) must\nnotify the department of this action, unless such action is in response to\ncorrective action in accordance with Subpart 6 of this Part. (ii)\n\nThe required assessment of the\nexcavation zone under subdivision (d) of this section must be performed after\nnotifying the department in accordance with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, but before completion of the permanent closure. The resultant report must be\nsubmitted to the department within 90 days after permanent closure. (iii)\nliquid and sludge must be removed from\nthe tank system. Any removed hazardous waste must be transported and disposed\nof in accordance with all applicable State, local and Federal\nrequirements; (iv)\nthe tank must be\ncleaned and rendered free of hazardous vapors. Provisions must be made for\nnatural breathing of the tank to ensure that the tank remains free of hazardous\nvapors; (v) all piping must be\ndisconnected and removed or securely capped or locked out or plugged. Manways\nmust be securely fastened in place; (vi)\ntanks must be removed from the ground\nunless it will be detrimental to a building foundation or other structure. Tanks that are closed in-place must be filled with a solid inert material (such\nas sand, concrete slurry, synthetic filler, or cellular concrete). If an inert\nmaterial is used, all voids within the tank must be filled; (vii)\nif a tank is to be disposed of, it must\nbe retested for hazardous vapors, rendered vapor free if necessary, cleaned of\nany residuals or sludge, and punched with holes or otherwise made unfit for\nstorage; and\n(viii)\nall tanks must\nbe protected from floatation caused by flooding or high ground water level in\naccordance with generally accepted engineering practices. (ix)\n\nWithin 30 days after permanent closure, the facility owner (or their authorized representative) must submit an\napplication to the department, in accordance with paragraph 1.14(a)(6) of this\n\nPart, indicating that the UST system has been permanently\nclosed. (2)\nA tank system\nmust undergo a change-in-service in accordance with the following: (i) At least 30 days before permanent\nclosure, the facility owner (or their authorized representative) must notify\nthe department of this action, unless such action is in response to corrective\naction in accordance with Subpart 6 of this Part. (ii)\n\nThe required assessment of the\nexcavation zone under subdivision (d) of this section must be performed after\nnotifying the department in accordance with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, but before completion of the permanent closure. The resultant report must be\nsubmitted to the department within 90 days after permanent closure. (iii)\nliquid and sludge must be removed from\nthe tank system. Any removed hazardous waste must be transported and disposed\nof in accordance with all applicable State, local and Federal\nrequirements; (iv)\nthe tank must be\ncleaned and rendered free of hazardous vapors. Provisions must be made for\nnatural breathing of the tank to ensure that the tank remains free of hazardous\nvapors; (v) Within 30 days after\npermanent closure, the facility owner (or their authorized representative) must\nsubmit an application to the Department, in accordance with paragraph\n1.14(a)(6) of this Part, indicating that the UST system has been permanently\nclosed. (c) Closure of tank systems abandoned prior to August 11, 1994. All tanks taken\nout-of-service, but still in or on the ground, prior to August 11, 1994 must be\nclosed in accordance with the requirements of subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (d) Site assessment for\npermanent closure. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator\nmust perform a site assessment at the time of permanent closure of any\nunderground tank system. A site assessment may be required of any such tank\nsystem that is permanently closed prior to August 11, 1994 if, in the judgment\nof the department, the tank poses a current or potential threat to human health\nor the environment. The site assessment must include soil, vapor, or\ngroundwater monitoring in sufficient depth to determine if environmental\ncontamination exists in the vicinity of the tank site. (2)\n\nIn selecting sample types, sample\nlocations, and measurement methods, the following must be considered: the\nmethod of closure, type of backfill, geology, water table contours, aquifer\nthickness, porosity, background water quality, the nature of the substance\nknown or suspected to have been stored at the facility, and other factors\nappropriate for identifying the presence of a release. (3)\n\nIf contaminated soil, vapor, groundwater\nor free product is discovered, the owner and operator must begin corrective\naction in accordance with section\n6.2\nof this Part. (4)\n\nThe site assessment report must be\nprepared by a qualified engineer or technician. Records of the date of closure\nand the report must be incorporated or referenced in the spill prevention\nreport and maintained for the life of the facility. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
