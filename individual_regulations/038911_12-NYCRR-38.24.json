  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 38.24 - Personnel monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) External radiation sources. (1)\n\nEach person\nwho possesses any radiation source shall supply and require the proper use of\nappropriate, calibrated and operable individual monitoring devices by: (i) adults likely to receive, in one year\nfrom sources external to the body, a dose in excess of 10 percent of the limits\nin section\n38.18\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Part (rule); (ii)\nminors and\ndeclared pregnant women likely to receive, in one year from sources external to\nthe body, a dose in excess of 10 percent of any of the applicable limits in\nsection\n38.18\n(g) or (h)\nof this Part (rule); and\n(iii)\nindividuals entering a high or very high radiation area. (2)\nA person supplying personnel monitoring\ndevices to individuals as required by this subdivision shall ensure that the\nindividuals wear such devices as follows: (i) An individual monitoring device used for monitoring the dose to the whole body\nshall be worn at the unshielded location of the whole body likely to receive\nthe highest exposure. (ii)\n\nAn\nindividual monitoring device used for monitoring the dose to an embryo/fetus of\na declared pregnant woman, pursuant to section\n38.18\n(h)(1)\nof\nthis Part (rule), shall be located at the waist under any protective apron worn\nby the woman. (iii)\n\nAn individual\nmonitoring device used for monitoring the eye dose equivalent shall be located\nat the neck outside any protective apron worn by the individual, or at an\nunshielded location closer to the eye. (iv)\n\nAn individual monitoring device used for\nmonitoring the dose to the extremities shall be worn on the extremity likely to\nreceive the highest exposure. The device shall be oriented to measure the\nhighest dose to the extremity being monitored. (3)\n\nAll personnel monitoring devices, except\nfor direct and indirect reading dosimeters and those dosimeters used to measure\nthe dose to any extremity, that require processing to determine the radiation\ndose and which are supplied pursuant to this subdivision or to conditions\nspecified in a license or registration, shall be processed and evaluated by a\ndosimetry processor: (i) holding current\npersonnel dosimetry accreditation from the National Voluntary Laboratory\n\nAccreditation Program (NVLAP) of the National Institute of Standards and\n\nTechnology; and\n(ii)\napproved in\nthis accreditation process for the type of radiation or radiations included in\nthe NVLAP program that most closely approximate the type of radiation or\nradiations for which the individual wearing the dosimeter is\nmonitored. (b) Intake of radioactive material. Each\nlicensee shall perform all appropriate measurements of those specified in\nsection\n38.18\n(d)(1)\nof\nthis Part (rule) which will enable him/her to determine the occupational intake\nof radioactive material by and assess the committed effective dose equivalent\nto: (1)\nadults likely to receive, in one\nyear, an intake in excess of 10 percent of the applicable ALI in Appendix A-13, Table I, columns 1 and 2, infra; and\n(2)\nminors and declared pregnant women likely\nto receive, in one year, a committed effective dose equivalent in excess of\n0.50 mSv (0.05 rem). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n38.24\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
