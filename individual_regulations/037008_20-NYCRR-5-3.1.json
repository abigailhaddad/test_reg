  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 5-3.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, sections 26, 210-B(21))\n(a) A corporation that is a qualified\nbuilding owner, as defined under section 26(b)(1), and that has been issued a\ncertificate of tax credit by the New York State Office of Homeland Security, is\nallowed to claim a credit against the tax imposed by article 9-A. The amount of\nthe credit allowed is $3,000 for each qualified security officer, as defined\nunder section 26(b)(4), who is directly or indirectly employed to provide\nprotection to the corporation's building or buildings for a full year. However, the amount of the credit may be reduced due to the limitation placed on the\ntotal amount of all tax credits issued by the New York State Office of Homeland\n\nSecurity in any calendar year. In the case of a qualified security officer who\nis employed for less than a full year, the amount of the credit is prorated to\nreflect the length of such employment as provided in this section. (b) The security training tax credit shall\nnot reduce the tax to less than the fixed dollar minimum tax. If the\ncorporation has excess security tax training credit after reducing the tax to\nthe fixed dollar minimum tax or the corporation otherwise pays the tax on the\nfixed dollar minimum, the security training tax credit shall be treated as an\noverpayment of tax to be credited or refunded. (c) A corporation must submit a Claim for\n\nSecurity Officer Training Credit on Form CT-631 when claiming the\ncredit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
