  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 253.3 - Special accruals\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1327, 1332, § 12(c) of § 1340(c); Codes and\n\nOrdinances of the City of Yonkers, §§ 92-86, 92-92, 92-109(c)\n(a) Where a taxpayer changes status from that\nof a resident to a nonresident of the City of Yonkers, such taxpayer must, regardless of the method of accounting normally employed, accrue and include in\nthe computation of net State tax, for purposes of determining the City of\n\nYonkers income tax surcharge for the portion of the year prior to the change of\nresident status, any items of income, gain, loss or deduction accruing prior to\nthe change of resident status, if not otherwise properly includible or\nallowable for purposes of computing net State tax for such prior portion of the\ntaxable year or for a prior taxable year. That is, in computing net State tax\nfor purposes of determining the City of Yonkers income tax surcharge for the\nresident period, such taxpayer must include all the items required to be\nincluded if a Federal income tax return were being filed for the same period on\nthe accrual basis, together with any other accruals such as deferred gain on\ninstallment obligations which are not otherwise includible or deductible for\nsuch prior period or for a prior taxable period. (b) With regard to special accruals in the\ncase of a change of residence from that of a nonresident of the City of Yonkers\nto a resident of the City of Yonkers, see section\n266.3\n(b) of this Title. (c) No items of\nincome, gain, loss or deduction accrued under this section for the portion of\nthe taxable year prior to the change of residence are to be taken into account\nfor any subsequent taxable period. (d) See also sections\n154.10\nand\n154.12\nof this Title with regard to special accruals in the case of a change of New\n\nYork State residence. (e) Special accruals not required in certain cases. The City of Yonkers income tax surcharge return for the\nperiod prior to a change of status from resident to nonresident may be filed\nwithout the special accruals if the taxpayer files with the State Tax\n\nCommission a surety bond or other security acceptable to the State Tax\n\nCommission (see section\n154.11\nof this Title), in an amount not less than the amount of additional City of\n\nYonkers income tax surcharge which would be payable if no such surety bond or\nother security were filed with the State Tax Commission. The filing of such\nsurety bond or other security is conditioned upon the inclusion of amounts\naccruable in the determination of net State tax for purposes of the City of\n\nYonkers income tax surcharge for one or more subsequent taxable years as if the\ntaxpayer had not changed resident status.
