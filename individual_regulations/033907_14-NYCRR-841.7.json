The calculated statewide fees based on\nprogram capacity, will then be adjusted using regional cost factors (based on\nthe county in which the facility is located). (3)\n\nFees will be deemed to be inclusive of\nall service delivery costs and will be considered payment in full for\nfee-for-service Medicaid reimbursed services.
