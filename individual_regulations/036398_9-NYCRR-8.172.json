Trump\nsigned into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Act), the first major overhaul of\nthe Internal Revenue Code of 1986; WHEREAS, the Act alters the rate of taxation for\nindividuals and businesses, by blatantly raising taxes on the middle cases\nfamilies to pay for tremendous tax breaks to corporations and the top 1% of\n\nAmericans; WHEREAS, the Act caps the allowable deduction for State and\nlocal income, sales and property taxes at $10,000, which penalizes many\nhomeowners throughout the state, and will cause federal taxes on New Yorkers to\nincrease by more than $14 billion; WHEREAS, New York State is the number one donor state in\nthe United States of America, as it provides $48 billion more to the Federal\ngovernment than it receives from the Federal government; WHEREAS, the Act will effectively make New York State\nstructurally less economically competitive than other states in the national\nmarket; WHEREAS, this Administration has fought hard to ensure that\nlocal governments are strong and financially secure through shared services, including absorbing the costs of Medicaid increases; WHEREAS, the Act will devastate local economies and the\nhousing market in many communities, which goes against this Administration's\npolicies to ease the financial burden of local governments, and the State as a\nwhole; and\nWHEREAS, significant and immediate action must be taken by\nthe State to ensure that New Yorkers are protected and shielded from the\nfinancially disastrous impacts of the Act.
