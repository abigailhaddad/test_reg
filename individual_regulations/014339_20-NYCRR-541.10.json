  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 541.10 - Tools and supplies\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1105(a)\n(a) Charges for tools or supplies (including\nsafety apparel) purchased by a contractor are subject to the State and local\nsales or use taxes. Example: A masonry contractor sets forms for pouring a foundation\nfooting in the performance of a nonagency contract for the erection of a\nbuilding for an exempt organization. The walls are set upon the footing and the\nfoundation is backfilled. The supplies used in making forms are left in the\nground since the cost of removal is more than the salvage value. Although the\nsupplies stay with the job they are considered abandoned and not transferred to\nthe customer as a component part of the project. The cost of the supplies is\ntaxable to the contractor. (b) Where a resident contractor purchases\ntools or supplies (including safety apparel) outside the State, the cost is\nsubject to State and local compensating use taxes when used in the State. Where\na contractor purchases tools or supplies (including safety apparel) in one\ntaxing jurisdiction and uses them in another jurisdiction having a higher\ncombined State and local tax rate and in which he was a resident contractor at\nthe time of purchase, a compensating use tax is due to the extent of the\ndifference in rates. Cross-reference: For refunds and credits based on purchases in bulk, see\nsection\n534.3\nof this Title. For computation of compensating use tax, see Part 531 of this\n\nTitle. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n541.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
