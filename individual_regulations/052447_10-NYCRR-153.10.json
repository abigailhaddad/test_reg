(3)\n\nThe term source of supply means the surface and ground waters--natural springs, wells, natural or artificial ponds and reservoirs--which are tributary to said public water supply. (4)\n\nThe term watercourse means every spring, stream, brook, natural ditch or channel (other than reservoirs) having a definite thread of flow through which water flows to said public water supply. (5)\n\nThe term reservoir means any place either natural or artificial wherein water is or may be impounded or stored and utilized as a source of said public water supply. (6)\n\nThe term well means any well now in use or which may be developed and used as a source of such public water supply.

(8)\n\nThe term sewage means liquids containing, either mixed or singly, human excreta, bath water or other decomposing organic matter of human origin flowing in or from a drainage system or sewer. This term does not apply to ordinary kitchen sink and laundry wastes which do not contain sewage and which do not flow through the same drainage system used for bath waters or liquids containing human excretions.

(10)\n\nThe term leaching system means any cesspool, tile drain, leaching beds or other system by which the effluent from any septic tank may escape and percolate into the surrounding soil. (11)\n\nThe term structure means any privy, septic tank, cesspool, leaching system or appurtenances or any building housing animals or poultry. (c) Relation of structures to watercourses, reservoirs, wells, etc. The controlling distance between a specified structure or object and any watercourse, reservoir, well, etc. shall be the distance measured in a horizontal plane from the nearest point of such structure to the nearest edge, margin or precipitous bank at the recognized high-water mark of a reservoir or well or to the ordinary water line of any watercourse. (d) [Human excreta.]\n(1)\n\nNo human excreta shall be deposited, thrown or placed in or be allowed to escape into any watercourse, reservoir or well of such public water supply. (2)\n\nNo human excreta shall be spread or deposited upon the surface of the ground on any part of the watershed.

(4)\n\nNo human excreta shall be buried in the ground on any part of the watershed outside the distance prescribed in paragraph (3) of this subdivision unless it be deposited in a trench or pit and covered with a minimum of 18 inches of earth, compacted in such a manner as to effectually prevent its being washed onto the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow. (5)\n\nWhere a privy or other place in regular use or intended for regular use for the deposit of human excreta is not provided with a watertight receptacle or watertight pit or vault, but has a porous receiving pit or vault, such structure or place shall not be allowed to remain within a distance of 300 feet of any reservoir or well or within 150 feet of any watercourse, and no such structure shall be erected within the aforesaid distances.
