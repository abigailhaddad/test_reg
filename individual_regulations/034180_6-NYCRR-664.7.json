Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n664.7\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 31, 2024/Volume XLVI, Issue 53, eff. 1/1/2025\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. (a) Procedures. (1)\n\nThe\ncommissioner\nshall supervise the maintenance of each\nmap. Maps shall be available for public examination at the appropriate regional office of the\ndepartment\nand in the office of the clerk of each county in which each\nwetland\nor a portion thereof is located. They will also be filed with each appropriate\nlocal government. (2)\n\nThe\ncommissioner\nmay, upon request by any\nperson\nhaving\nevidence\nsuch as photographs of the area in question, or upon\ndepartment\ninitiative, issue an order amending or adjusting any\nmap\nfor the following reasons and under the following circumstances: (i) The\ncommissioner\nmay amend a\nmap\nby adding a previously unmapped or newly created\nwetland\nto the\nmap, by significantly expanding or contracting the boundaries of a\nwetland\nshown on the\nmap, or by deleting a\nwetland\nfrom the\nmap, all as may be necessary to conform the\nmap\nto actual\nonsite\nconditions. This will be done only after a copy of the proposed amended\nmap\nhas been made available for public inspection in the appropriate regional office of the\ndepartment\nand in the office of the clerk of each affected\nlocal government, and only after the\ncommissioner\nhas provided notice of the proposed amendment and an opportunity for a public\nhearing\non the proposal. The notice shall be sent by certified mail, not fewer than 30 days prior to any such\nhearing, to each\nowner\nof record, as shown on the latest completed tax assessment rolls, of land involved in the proposed amendment and also to the chief administrative officer and clerk of each affected\nlocal government. Notice of the proposed amendment shall also be published at least once in at least two newspapers having a general circulation in the area that is the subject of the proposed amendment, and also in the\ndepartment\n's environmental notice bulletin. If a\nhearing\nis scheduled, notice shall be provided to the same parties, and also published, in the same manner, not more than 30 nor fewer than 10 days before the date set for the\nhearing. Once the announcement of a proposed amendment has been made, no activity subject to regulation pursuant to the\nact\nshall be initiated within the area that is the subject of the proposal until the\ncommissioner\nhas either amended the\nmap\nor denied the amendment. However, no activity which has already been initiated at the time of the announcement, within an area that is proposed as an addition to the\nmap, will be subject to such regulation. (ii)\n\nNotwithstanding subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the\ncommissioner\nmay make minor adjustments to a\nmap\nas follows: to reflect natural changes that have occurred through erosion or accretion since the effective date of the\nmap, as originally established or amended; to reflect changes that have occurred as a result of granting permits under the\nact; to clarify the boundaries of any\nwetlands; to correct minor errors; or to effect other technical changes. These adjustments may be made only after notice by certified mail to each\nowner\nof record, as shown on the latest completed tax assessment rolls, of land involved in the adjustment and to the chief administrative officer of each affected\nlocal government, at least 30 days prior to the issuance of an order adjusting the\nmap. A public\nhearing\nwill not be held on any such proposed adjustment unless the\ncommissioner\ndetermines that it is appropriate, at which time the provisions set forth in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph shall apply. (3)\n\nAny public\nhearing\nheld pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision shall provide to any\nperson\nan opportunity to support, oppose, or make a statement of interest in, a proposed amendment or adjustment to a\nmap. (4)\n\nAfter considering the testimony given at any such\nhearing\nand any other facts which may be deemed pertinent, and after considering the rights of affected property owners and the policy and purposes of the\nact, the\ncommissioner\neither shall deny the amendment or adjustment or shall promulgate by order an amended or adjusted\nmap. A copy of any such order, together with a copy of the relevant portion of the amended or adjusted\nmap, shall be filed in the office of the clerk of each affected\nlocal government. The\ncommissioner\nshall simultaneously give notice of such decision and any resultant order to each\nowner, as shown on the latest completed tax assessment rolls, of land that is the subject of the decision. This notice shall be given by mailing a copy of the decision and any resultant order to the\nowner\nby certified mail, in any case where a notice by certified mail was not sent under paragraph (2) of this subdivision, and in all other cases by first class mail. At the same time, the\ncommissioner\nshall give notice of the decision and any resultant order to the chief administrative officer of each affected\nlocal government. A copy of the decision and any resultant order also shall be published in at least two newspapers having a general circulation in the area that is the subject of the decision, and notice of the decision also shall be published in the\ndepartment\n's environmental notice bulletin. (b) Treatment\nof two or more areas as a single\nwetland. Two or more areas of land and/or water, as defined in paragraphs (a) through (d) of section 24- 0107(1) of the\nact, may be considered to be a single\nwetland\nfor regulatory purposes if they are determined by the\ncommissioner\nto function as a unit, or to be dependent upon each other, in providing one or more of the\nwetland\nbenefits listed in paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (e), (f), and (i) of section 24- 0105(7) of the\nact, and if they are no more than 50 meters (approximately 165 feet) apart. The areas will be included, and labelled as a single\nwetland, on a\nmap\naccording to the procedures for amending a\nmap\nset out in subdivision (a) of this section. (c) Wetlands\nof less than 12.4 acres (approximately 5 hectares) having unusual local importance. (1)\n\nThe\ncommissioner\nshall designate an area of land and/or water, as defined in paragraphs (a) through (d) of section 24-0107(1) of the\nact, of less than 12.4 acres (approximately 5 hectares) as a\nwetland\nhaving unusual local importance if it contains any class I characteristic listed in section\n664.5\n(a) of this Part. Any\nperson\nmay nominate such an area for this purpose by providing\nevidence\nor testimony to the\ndepartment\nthat the area contains such a class I characteristic. Pursuant to section\n663.3\n(g) of this Title, the\ncommissioner\nmay delegate jurisdiction over such a\nwetland\nto a\nlocal government\nwithin which the\nwetland\nis located if that government is the regulating authority for\nwetlands\npursuant to the\nact. (2)\n\nFor any such area not containing a class I characteristic, the\ncommissioner\nshall consider its nomination as a\nwetland\nhaving unusual local importance for one or more of the benefits enumerated in section 24-0105(7) of the\nact\nand, in accepting or rejecting nominations, shall take into account the expressed local interest. (3)\n\nWhere an area of land and/or water, as defined in paragraphs (a) through (d) of section 24-0107(1) of the\nact, of less than 12.4 acres (approximately 5 hectares) is on a\n\nState\nor national border, that portion of the area that is within New York shall be designated as a\nwetland\nhaving unusual local importance if the rest of the area is receiving protection as a\nwetland\nin the adjoining\nstate\nor nation. (4)\nA designation of an area as a\nwetland\nhaving unusual local importance shall be made pursuant to section 24-0301(1) of the\nact, but included on the\nmap\nonly after the\ncommissioner\nhas followed the procedures for amending a\nmap\nset out in subdivision (a) of this section. (d) Extending the\nadjacent area. All or part of a\nwetland\n's\nadjacent area\nmay be extended beyond 100 feet (approximately 30 meters) from a\nwetland\nboundary where necessary to protect and preserve the\nwetland, pursuant to section 24- 0701(2) of the\nact. Such an extension shall be in relation to the nature and importance of the\nwetland\n's benefits, the resulting\nwetland\nclassification, and the fragility and vulnerability of the\nwetland\nand its benefits, and shall be made only after the\ncommissioner\nhas followed the procedures for amending a\nmap\nset out in subdivision (a) of this section. The amended\nmap\nwill indicate what\nwetland\nhas been affected by an\nadjacent area\nextension, and a record showing that extension in more detail shall be available in the same locations as the\nmap\nof the\nwetland\nto which it is adjacent, as those locations are set forth in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of this section.
