The requirements of this section apply to owners and\noperators of facilities that use tank systems for storing or treating hazardous\nwaste except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this\nsubdivision or section\n373-2.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart. (1)\n\nTank systems that are\nused to store or treat hazardous waste which contain no free liquids and are\nsituated inside a building with an impermeable floor are exempted from the\nrequirements in subdivision (d) of this section. To demonstrate the absence or\npresence of free liquids in the stored/treated waste, the following test must\nbe used: Method 9095B (Paint Filter Liquids Test) as described in \"Test Methods\nfor Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" EPA publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nTank systems, including\nsumps, as defined in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle, that serve as part of a secondary containment system to collect or\ncontain releases of hazardous wastes are exempted from the requirements of\nparagraph (d)(1) of this section. (3)\n\nTanks, sumps, and other such collection\ndevices or systems used in conjunction with drip pads, as defined in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle and regulated under section\n373-2.23\nof this Part, must meet\nthe requirements of this section. (b) Assessment of existing tank\nsystem's integrity. (1)\n\nFor each\nexisting tank system that does not have secondary containment meeting the\nrequirements of subdivision (d) of this section, the owner or operator must\ndetermine that the tank system that does not have secondary containment meeting\nthe requirements of subdivision (d) of this section, is not leaking or is unfit\nfor use. Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, the owner or\noperator must obtain and keep on file at the facility a written assessment\nreviewed and certified by an independent, qualified, professional engineer\nregistered in New York that attests to the tank system's integrity by December\n25, 1989. The certification must be consistent with the applicable provisions\nof section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)(iv)\nof this Part. (2)\n\nThis assessment\nmust determine that the tank system is adequately designed and has sufficient\nstructural strength and compatibility with the wastes to be stored or treated, to ensure that it will not collapse, rupture or fail. At a minimum, this\nassessment must consider the following: (i) design standards, if available, according to which the tank and ancillary\nequipment were constructed; (ii)\nhazardous characteristics of the wastes that have been and will be\nhandled; (iii)\nexisting corrosion\nprotection measures; (iv)\ndocumented age of the tank system, if available (otherwise, an estimate of the\nage); and\n(v) results of a leak\ntest, internal inspection, or other tank integrity examination such that: (a) for nonenterable underground tanks, the\nassessment must include a leak test that is capable of taking into account the\neffects of temperature variations, tank end deflection, vapor pockets, and high\nwater table effects; and\n(b) for\nother than nonenterable underground tanks and for ancillary equipment, this\nassessment must include either a leak test, as described above, or other tank\nintegrity examination, that is certified by an independent, qualified, professional engineer registered in New York, that addresses cracks, leaks, corrosion and erosion. The certification must be consistent with the applicable\nprovisions of section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)(iv)\nof this Part. Note: The practices described in the American Petroleum\n\nInstitute (API) Publication, Guide for Inspection of Refinery\n\nEquipment, chapter XIII, \"atmospheric and low-pressure storage tanks,\"\n4th edition, 1981, may be used, where applicable, as guidelines in conducting\nan integrity examination. (3)\n\nTank systems that store or treat\nmaterials that become hazardous wastes after December 25, 1988, must conduct\nthis assessment within 12 months after the date that the waste becomes a\nhazardous waste. (4)\n\nIf, as a\nresult of the assessment conducted in accordance with paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, a tank system is found to be leaking or unfit for use, the owner\nor operator must comply with the requirements of subdivision (g) of this\nsection. (c) Design\nand installation of new tank systems or components. (1)\n\nOwners or operators of new tank systems\nor components must obtain and submit to the commissioner at time of submittal\nof the Part 373 permit application, a written assessment, reviewed and\ncertified by an independent, qualified, professional engineer registered in New\n\nYork attesting that the tank system has sufficient structural integrity and is\nacceptable for storing and treating of hazardous waste. The certification must\nbe consistent with the applicable provisions of section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)(iv)\nof this Part. The assessment must show that the foundation, structural support, seams, connections, and pressure controls (if applicable) are adequately\ndesigned and that the tank system has sufficient structural strength, compatibility with the wastes to be stored or treated, and corrosion protection\nto ensure that it will not collapse, rupture or fail. This assessment, which\nwill be used by the commissioner to review and approve or disapprove the\nacceptability of the tank system design, must include, at a minimum, the\nfollowing information: (i) design standards\naccording to which tanks and/or the ancillary equipment are\nconstructed; (ii)\nhazardous\ncharacteristics of the wastes to be handled; (iii)\nfor new tank systems or components in\nwhich the external shell of a metal tank or any other external metal component\nof the tank system will be in contact with the soil or with water, a\ndetermination by a corrosion expert of: (a) factors affecting the potential for corrosion, including but not limited to: (1)\nsoil moisture content; (2)\nsoil pH; (3)\nsoil sulfides level; (4)\nsoil resistivity; (5)\nstructure to soil potential; (6)\ninfluence of nearby underground metal\nstructures (\ne.g., piping); (7)\nexistence of stray electric current; and\n(8)\nexisting corrosion\nprotection measures (\ne.g., coating, cathodic protection); and\n(b) the type and degree\nof external corrosion protection that are needed to ensure the integrity of the\ntank system during the use of the tank system or component, consisting of one\nor more of the following: (1)\ncorrosion-resistant materials of construction such as special alloys, fiberglass reinforced plastic, etc.; (2)\ncorrosion-resistant coating (such as\nepoxy, fiberglass, etc.) with cathodic protection (\ne.g., impressed current or sacrificial anodes); (3)\nelectrical isolation devices such as\ninsulating joints, flanges, etc.; Note: The practices described in the National Association of\n\nCorrosion Engineers (NACE) standard, \"recommended practice (RP-02-85) control\nof external corrosion on metallic buried, partially buried, or submerged liquid\nstorage systems,\" and the American Petroleum Institute (API) publication 1632, Cathodic Protection Of Underground Petroleum Storage Tanks and Piping\n\nSystems, may be used, where applicable, as guidelines in providing\ncorrosion protection for tank systems. (iv)\nfor underground tank system components\nthat are likely to be adversely affected by vehicular traffic, a determination\nof design or operational measures that will protect the tank system against\npotential damage; (v) design\nconsiderations to ensure that: (a) tank\nfoundations will maintain the load of a full tank; (b) tank systems will be anchored to prevent\nflotation or dislodgement where the tank system is placed in a saturated zone\nor is located within a seismic fault zone; and\n(c) tank systems will withstand the effects\nof frost heave. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator of a new tank\nsystem must ensure that proper handling procedures are followed to prevent\ndamage to the system during installation. Prior to covering, enclosing, or\nplacing a new tank system or component in use, an independent, qualified, installation inspector or an independent, qualified, professional engineer\nregistered in New York, either of whom is trained and experienced in the proper\ninstallation of tank systems or components, must inspect the system for the\npresence of any of the following items: (i) weld breaks; (ii)\npunctures; (iii)\nscrapes of\nprotective coatings; (iv)\ncracks; (v) corrosion; and\n(vi)\nother structural damage or\ninadequate construction/installation. All discrepancies must be remedied before the tank system\nis covered, enclosed, or placed in use. (3)\n\nNew tank systems or components that are\nplaced underground and that are backfilled must be provided with a backfill\nmaterial that is a noncorrosive, porous, homogeneous substance and that is\ninstalled so that the backfill is placed completely around the tank and\ncompacted to ensure that the tank and piping are fully and uniformly\nsupported. (4)\n\nAll new tanks and\nancillary equipment must be tested for tightness prior to being covered, enclosed or placed in use. If a tank system is found not to be tight, all\nrepairs necessary to remedy the leaks in the system must be performed prior to\nthe tank system being covered, enclosed or placed into use. (5)\n\nAncillary equipment must be supported and\nprotected against physical damage and excessive stress due to settlement, vibration, expansion, or contraction. Note: The piping system installation procedures described in\n\nAmerican Petroleum Institute (API) publication 1615 (November 1979), Installation of Underground Petroleum Storage Systems, or ANSI\nstandard B31.3, \"petroleum refinery piping,\" and ANSI standard B31.4, \"liquid\npetroleum transportation piping system,\" may be used, where applicable, as\nguidelines for proper installation of piping systems. (6)\n\nThe owner or operator must provide the\ntype and degree of corrosion protection recommended by an independent corrosion\nexpert, based on the information provided under subparagraph (1)(iii) of this\nsubdivision, or other corrosion protection if the commissioner believes other\ncorrosion protection is necessary to ensure the integrity of the tank system\nduring use of the tank system. The installation of a corrosion protection\nsystem that is field-fabricated must be supervised by an independent corrosion\nexpert to ensure proper installation. (7)\n\nThe owner or operator must obtain and\nkeep on file at the facility written statements by those persons required to\ncertify the design of the tank system and supervise the installation of the\ntank system in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (2)-(6) of this\nsubdivision that attest that the tank system was properly designed and\ninstalled and that repairs, pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (4) of this\nsubdivision were performed. These written statements must also include the\ncertification statement as required in section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)(iv)\nof this Part. (d) Containment and detection of releases.

(2)\n\nSecondary\ncontainment systems must be: (i) designed, installed, and operated to prevent any migration of wastes or accumulated\nliquid out of the system to the soil, ground water, or surface water at any\ntime during the use of the tank system; and\n(ii)\ncapable of detecting and collecting\nreleases and accumulated liquids until the collected material is\nremoved. (3)\n\nTo meet the\nrequirements of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, secondary containment\nsystems must be at a minimum: (i) constructed\nof or lined with materials that are compatible with the wastes to be placed in\nthe tank system and must have sufficient strength and thickness to prevent\nfailure owing to pressure gradients (including static head and external\nhydrological forces), physical contact with the waste to which it is exposed, climatic conditions, and the stress of daily operation (including stresses from\nnearby vehicular traffic); (ii)\nplaced on a foundation or base capable of providing support to the secondary\ncontainment system, providing resistance to pressure gradients above and below\nthe system, and preventing failure due to settlement, compression, or\nuplift; (iii)\nprovided with a leak\ndetection system that is designed and operated so that it will detect the\nfailure of either the primary or secondary containment structure or the\npresence of any release of hazardous waste or accumulated liquid in the\nsecondary containment system within 24 hours, or at the earliest practicable\ntime, if the owner or operator can demonstrate to the commissioner that\nexisting detection technologies or site conditions will not allow detection of\na release within 24 hours; and\n(iv)\nsloped or otherwise designed or operated to drain and remove liquids resulting\nfrom leaks, spills, or precipitation. Spilled or leaked waste and accumulated\nprecipitation must be removed from the secondary containment system within 24\nhours, or in as timely a manner as is possible to prevent harm to human health\nand the environment, if the owner or operator can demonstrate to the\ncommissioner that removal of the released waste or accumulated precipitation\ncannot be accomplished within 24 hours. Note: If the collected material is a hazardous waste under Part\n371 of this Title, it is subject to management as a hazardous waste in\naccordance with all applicable requirements of Parts 370 through 373 of this\n\nTitle. If the collected material is discharged through a point source to waters\nof the United States, it is subject to the requirements of Parts 701, 702 and\n750 of this Title. If discharged to a publicly owned treatment works (POTW), it\nis subject to the requirements of section 307 of the Clean Water Act, as\namended. If the collected material is released to the environment, it may be\nsubject to the reporting requirements of 40 CFR Part\n302. (4)\n\nSecondary containment for\ntanks must include one or more of the following devices: (i) a liner (external to the tank); (ii)\na vault; (iii)\na double-walled tank; or\n(iv)\nan equivalent device as approved by the\ndepartment.

Such additional capacity must be sufficient to contain\nprecipitation from a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event; (c) free of cracks or gaps; (d) designed and installed to surround the\ntank completely and to cover all surrounding earth likely to come into contact\nwith the waste if the waste is released from the tank (\ni.e., capable of preventing lateral as well as vertical migration of the waste. For\nonground and inground tanks, the external liner system must also encompass the\nbottom of the tank); (e) external\nconcrete liners must be constructed with chemical-resistant water stops in\nplace at all joints (if any); and\n(f) external concrete liners must be provided\nwith an impermeable coating that is compatible with the stored waste and that\nwill prevent migration of waste into the concrete. (ii)\nvault systems must be: (a) designed or operated to contain 100\npercent of the capacity of the largest tank or the volume of all interconnected\ntanks, whichever is greater, within its boundary; (b) designed or operated to prevent run-on or\ninfiltration of precipitation into the secondary containment system unless the\ncollection system has sufficient excess capacity to contain run-on or\ninfiltration. Such additional capacity must be sufficient to contain\nprecipitation from a 25-year, 24-hour rainfall event; (c) constructed with chemical-resistant water\nstops in place at all joints (if any); (d) provided with an impermeable interior\ncoating or lining that is compatible with the stored waste and that will\nprevent migration of waste into the concrete; (e) provided with a means to protect against\nthe formation of and ignition of vapors within the vault, if the waste being\nstored or treated: (1)\nmeets the definition\nof ignitable waste under section\n371.3\n(b) of this\n\nTitle; or\n(2)\nmeets the definition\nof reactive waste under section\n371.3\n(d) of this\n\nTitle and may form an ignitable or explosive vapor; and\n(f) provided with an exterior moisture\nbarrier or be otherwise designed or operated to prevent migration of moisture\ninto the vault if the vault is subject to hydraulic\npressure; (iii)\ndouble-walled tanks must be: (a) designed as\nan integral structure (\ni.e., an inner tank completely\nenveloped within an outer shell) so that any release from the inner tank is\ncontained by the outer shell; (b) protected, if constructed of metal, from both corrosion of the primary tank\ninterior and of the external surface of the outer shell; and\n(c) provided with a built-in continuous leak\ndetection system capable of detecting a release within 24 hours, or at the\nearliest practicable time, if the owner or operator can demonstrate to the\ncommissioner, and the commissioner concludes, that the existing detection\ntechnology or site conditions would not allow detection of a release within 24\nhours. Note: The provisions outlined in the steel tank institute's\n(STI)\nstandard for dual wall underground steel storage tanks\nmay be used as guidelines for aspects of the design of underground steel\ndouble-walled tanks. (6)\n\nAncillary equipment must be provided with\nsecondary containment (\ne.g., trench, jacketing, double-walled\npiping) that meets the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of this\nsubdivision except for: (i) aboveground\npiping (exclusive of flanges, joints, valves, and other connections) that are\nvisually inspected for leaks on a daily basis; (ii)\nwelded flanges, welded joints, and\nwelded connections, that are visually inspected for leaks on a daily\nbasis; (iii)\nsealless or magnetic\ncoupling pumps and sealless valves, that are visually inspected for leaks on a\ndaily basis; and\n(iv)\npressurized\naboveground piping systems with automatic shutoff devices\n(\ne.g., excess flow check valves, flow metering shutdown\ndevices, loss of pressure activated shutoff devices) that are visually\ninspected for leaks on a daily basis. (7)\n\nThe owner or operator may obtain a\nvariance from the requirements of this subdivision if the commissioner finds as\na result of a demonstration by the owner or operator, that alternative design\nand operating practices together with location characteristics will prevent the\nmigration of any hazardous waste or hazardous constituents into the ground\nwater or surface water at least as effectively as secondary containment during\nthe active life of the tank system; or if the commissioner finds that in the\nevent of a release that does migrate to ground water or surface water, no\nsubstantial present or potential hazard will be posed to human health or the\nenvironment. New underground tank systems may not, per a demonstration in\naccordance with subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, be exempted from the\nsecondary containment requirements of this subdivision. (i) In deciding whether to grant a variance\nbased on a demonstration of equivalent protection of ground water and surface\nwater, the commissioner will consider: (a) the nature and quantity of the wastes; (b) the proposed alternate design and\noperation; (c) the hydrogeologic\nsetting of the facility, including the thickness of soils present between the\ntank system and ground water; and\n(d) all other factors that would influence\nthe quality and mobility of the hazardous constituents and the potential for\nthem to migrate to ground water or surface water. (ii)\n\nIn deciding whether to grant a variance\nbased on a demonstration of no substantial present or potential hazard, the\ncommissioner will consider: (a) the potential\nadverse effects on ground water, surface water, and land quality taking into\naccount; (1)\nthe physical and chemical\ncharacteristics of the waste in the tank system, including its potential for\nmigration; (2)\nthe hydrogeological\ncharacteristics of the facility and surrounding land; (3)\nthe potential for health risks caused by\nhuman exposure to waste constituents; (4)\nthe potential for damage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures caused by exposure to waste\nconstituents; and\n(5)\nthe\npersistence and permanence of the potential adverse effects; (b) the potential adverse effects\nof a release on ground water quality, taking into account: (1)\nthe quantity and quality of ground water\nand the direction of ground water flow; (2)\nthe proximity and withdrawal rates of\nground water users; (3)\nthe current\nand future uses of ground water in the area; and\n(4)\nthe existing quality of ground water, including other sources of contamination and their cumulative impact on the\nground water quality; (c) the potential adverse effects of a release on surface water quality, taking\ninto account: (1)\nthe quantity and quality of\nground water and the direction of ground water flow; (2)\nthe patterns of rainfall in the\nregion; (3)\nthe proximity of the\ntank system to surface waters; (4)\nthe current and future uses of surface waters in the area and any water quality\nstandards established for those surface waters; and\n(5)\nthe existing quality of surface water, including other sources of contamination and the cumulative impact on surface\nwater quality; and\n(d) the potential adverse effects of a release on the land surrounding the tank\nsystem, taking into account: (1)\nthe patterns\nof rainfall in the region; and\n(2)\nthe current and future uses of the surrounding land. (iii)\n\nThe owner or operator of a\ntank system, for which a variance from secondary containment had been granted\nin accordance with the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, at\nwhich a release of hazardous waste has occurred from the primary tank system\nbut has not migrated beyond the zone of engineering control (as established in\nthe variance), must: (a) comply with the\nrequirements of subdivision (g) of this section, except paragraph (g)(4); and\n(b) decontaminate or remove\ncontaminated soil to the extent necessary to: (1)\nenable the tank system for which the\nvariance was granted to resume operation with the capability for the detection\nof releases at least equivalent to the capability it had prior to the release; and\n(2)\nprevent the migration of\nhazardous waste or hazardous constituents to ground water or surface water; and\n(c) if contaminated\nsoil cannot be removed or decontaminated in accordance with clause\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph, comply with the requirement of\nparagraph (h)(2) of this section. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator of a tank system, for which a variance from secondary containment had been granted in accordance\nwith the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, at which a release\nof hazardous waste has occurred from the primary tank system and has migrated\nbeyond the zone of engineering control (as established in the variance), must: (a) comply with the requirements of\nparagraphs (g)(1), (2), (3) and (4) of this section; (b) prevent the migration of hazardous waste\nor hazardous constituents to ground water or surface water, if possible, and\ndecontaminate or remove contaminated soil. If contaminated soil cannot be\ndecontaminated or removed or if ground water has been contaminated, the owner\nor operator must comply with the requirements of paragraph (h)(2) of this\nsection; and\n(c) provide secondary\ncontainment in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1)-(6) of this\nsubdivision if repairing, replacing, or reinstalling the tank system, or\nreapply for a variance from secondary containment and meet the requirements for\nnew tank systems in subdivision (c) of this section if the tank system is\nreplaced. The owner or operator must comply with these requirements even if\ncontaminated soil can be decontaminated or removed and ground water or surface\nwater has not been contaminated. (8)\n\nThe following procedures must be followed\nin order to request a variance from secondary containment: (i) The commissioner must be notified in\nwriting by the owner or operator that he or she intends to conduct and submit a\ndemonstration for a variance from secondary containment as allowed in paragraph\n(7) of this subdivision according to the following schedule: (a) for existing tank systems, at least 24\nmonths prior to the date that secondary containment must be provided in\naccordance with paragraph (1) of this subdivision; (b) for new tank systems, at least 30 days\nprior to entering into a contract for installation.

The demonstration must address each of the factors listed in\nsubparagraph (7)(i) or (ii) of this subdivision. (iii)\n\nThe demonstration for a variance must\nbe completed within 180 days after notifying the commissioner of an intent to\nconduct the demonstration. (iv)\n\nIf\na variance is granted under this paragraph, the commissioner will require the\npermittee to construct and operate the tank system in the manner that was\ndemonstrated to meet the requirements for the variance. (9)\n\nAll tank systems, until such time as\nsecondary containment that meets the requirements of this section is provided, must comply with the following: (i) for\nnonenterable underground tanks, a leak test that meets the requirements of\nsubparagraph (b)(2)(v) of this section or other tank integrity method, as\napproved or required by the commissioner, must be conducted at least\nannually; (ii)\nfor other than\nnonenterable underground tanks, the owner or operator must either conduct a\nleak test as in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph or develop a schedule and\nprocedure for an assessment of the overall condition of the tank system by an\nindependent, qualified professional engineer registered in New York. The\nschedule and procedure must be adequate to detect obvious cracks, leaks, and\ncorrosion or erosion that may lead to cracks and leaks. The owner or operator\nmust remove the stored waste from the tank, if necessary, to allow the\ncondition of all internal tank surfaces to be assessed. The frequency of these\nassessments must be based on the material of construction of the tank and its\nancillary equipment, the age of the system, the type of corrosion or erosion\nprotection used, the rate of corrosion or erosion observed during the previous\ninspection, and the characteristics of the waste being stored or\ntreated; (iii)\nfor ancillary\nequipment, a leak test or other integrity assessment as approved by the\ncommissioner must be conducted at least annually; Note: The practices described in the American Petroleum\n\nInstitute (API) publication\n\nGuide for Inspection of Refinery\n\nEquipment, chapter XIII, \"atmospheric and low-pressure storage tanks,\"\n4th edition, 1981, may be used, where applicable, as guidelines for assessing\nthe overall condition of the tank system. (iv)\nthe owner or operator must maintain on\nfile at the facility a record of the results of the assessments conducted in\naccordance with subparagraphs (i)-(iii) of this paragraph; (v) if a tank system or component is found to\nbe leaking or unfit for use as a result of the leak test or assessment in\nsubparagraphs (i)-(iii) of this paragraph, the owner or operator must comply\nwith the requirements of subdivision (g) of this section. (e) General operating requirements. (1)\n\nHazardous wastes or treatment reagents\nmust not be placed in a tank system if they could cause the tank, its ancillary\nequipment, or the containment system to rupture, leak, corrode or otherwise\nfail. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator\nmust use appropriate controls and practices to prevent spills and overflows\nfrom tank or containment systems. These include at a minimum: (i) spill prevention controls\n(\ne.g., check valves, dry disconnect couplings); (ii)\noverfill prevention controls\n(\ne.g., level sensing devices, high level alarms, automatic\nfeed cutoff, or bypass to a standby tank); and\n(iii)\nmaintenance of sufficient freeboard in\nuncovered tanks to prevent overtopping by wave or wind action or by\nprecipitation. (3)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must comply with the requirements of subdivision (g) if a\nleak or spill occurs in the tank system. (4)\n\nThe owner or operator must mark all tanks\nwith the words \"Hazardous Waste\" and with other words that identify the\ncontents of the tanks. For underground tanks, the markings must be placed on a\nsign in the area above the tank. (f) Inspections.

Note: Section\n373-2.2\n(g)(3)\nof\nthis Part requires the owner or operator to remedy any deterioration or\nmalfunction the owner or operator finds. Subdivision (g) of this section\nrequires the owner or operator to notify the department within 24 hours of\nconfirming a leak. Also, 40 CFR Part\n302\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) may require the owner or operator to notify the National Response Center\nof a release. (3)\n\nIn\naddition, except as noted under paragraph (4) of this subdivision, the owner or\noperator must inspect at least once each operating day: (i) aboveground portions of the tank system, if any, to detect corrosion or releases of waste; and\n(ii)\nthe construction materials and the area\nimmediately surrounding the externally accessible portion of the tank system, including the secondary containment system (\ne.g., dikes) to\ndetect erosion or signs of releases of hazardous waste (\ne.g., wet spots, dead vegetation). (4)\n\nOwners or operators of tank systems that\neither use leak detection systems to alert facility personnel to leaks, or\nimplement other established workplace practices to ensure leaks are promptly\nidentified within 24 hours, must inspect at least weekly those areas described\nin subparagraphs (3)(i) and (ii) of this subdivision. Use of the alternate\ninspection schedule must be documented in the facility's operating record. This\ndocumentation must include a description of the established workplace practices\nat the facility. (5)\n\nAncillary\nequipment that is not otherwise secondarily contained, as described in\nsubparagraphs (d)(6)(i) through (iv) of this section, must be inspected at\nleast once each operating day.

Note: The practices described in the National Association of\n\nCorrosion Engineers (NACE) standard, \"recommended practice (RP-02-85) control\nof external corrosion on metallic buried, partially buried, or submerged liquid\nstorage systems\", (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) and the American Petroleum Institute (API) publication 1632, Cathodic Protection of Underground Petroleum Storage Tanks and Piping\n\nSystems\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) may be used, where applicable, as guidelines in maintaining and\ninspecting cathodic protection systems. (7)\n\nThe owner or operator must document in\nthe operating record of the facility an inspection of those items in paragraphs\n(1)-(6) of this subdivision. (g) Response to leaks or spills and\ndisposition of leaking or unfit-for-use tank systems. A tank system or secondary containment system from which\nthere has been a leak or spill, or which is unfit for use, must be removed from\nservice immediately, and the owner or operator must satisfy the following\nrequirements: (1)\n\nCessation of use; prevent flow or addition of wastes. The owner or operator must immediately stop\nthe flow of hazardous waste into the tank system or secondary containment\nsystem and inspect the system to determine the cause of the release. (2)\n\nRemoval of waste from tank system or\nsecondary containment system. (i) If the\nrelease was from the tank system, the owner or operator must, within 24 hours\nafter detection of the leak or, if the owner or operator, demonstrates that it\nis not possible, at the earliest practicable time, remove as much of the waste\nas is necessary to prevent further release of hazardous waste to the\nenvironment and to allow inspection and repair of the tank system. (ii)\n\nIf material was released to a secondary\ncontainment system, all released materials must be removed within 24 hours or\nin as timely a manner as is possible to prevent harm to human health and the\nenvironment. (3)\n\nContainment of visible releases to the environment. The owner or operator must\nimmediately conduct a visual inspection of the release and, based upon that\ninspection: (i) prevent further migration of\nthe leak or spill to soils or surface water; and\n(ii)\nremove, and properly dispose of, any\nvisible contamination of the soil or surface water. (4)\n\nNotifications, reports. (i) Any release to the environment, except as\nprovided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, must be reported to the\ncommissioner within 24 hours of its detection. If the release has been reported\nto 6 NYCRR Part\n595, that report will satisfy this requirement. Note: The DEC spill hotline number is (800) 457-7362; outside\nof New York State (518) 457-7362. (ii)\nA leak or spill of hazardous waste is\nexempted from the requirements of this paragraph if it is: (a) less than or equal to a quantity of one\npound; and\n(b) immediately\ncontained and cleaned-up. (iii)\n\nWithin 30 days of detection of a\nrelease to the environment, a report containing the following information must\nbe submitted to the commissioner: (a) likely\nroute of migration of the release; (b) characteristics of the surrounding soil\n(soil composition, geology, hydrogeology, climate); (c) results of any monitoring or sampling\nconducted in connection with the release (if available). If sampling or\nmonitoring data relating to the release are not available within 30 days, these\ndata must be submitted to the commissioner as soon as they become\navailable; (d) proximity to\ndowngradient drinking water, surface water, and populated areas; and\n(e) description of response actions taken or\nplanned. (5)\n\nProvision of secondary containment, repair or closure. (i) Unless the owner or operator satisfies\nthe requirements of subparagraphs (ii)-(iv) of this paragraph, the tank system\nmust be closed in accordance with subdivision (h) of this section. (ii)\n\nIf the cause of the release was a spill\nthat has not damaged the integrity of the system, the owner or operator may\nreturn the system to service as soon as the released waste is removed and\nrepairs, if necessary, are made. (iii)\n\nIf the cause of the release was a leak\nfrom the primary tank system into the secondary containment system, the system\nmust be repaired prior to returning the tank system to service. (iv)\n\nIf the source of the release was a leak\nto the environment from a component of a tank system without secondary\ncontainment, the owner or operator must provide the component of the system\nfrom which the leak occurred with secondary containment that satisfies the\nrequirements of subdivision (d) of this section before it can be returned to\nservice, unless the source of the leak is an aboveground portion of a tank\nsystem that can be inspected visually. If the source is an aboveground\ncomponent that can be inspected visually, the component must be repaired and\nmay be returned to service without secondary containment as long as the\nrequirements of paragraph (6) of this subdivision are satisfied. If a component\nis replaced to comply with the requirements of this subparagraph, that\ncomponent must satisfy the requirements for new tank systems or components in\nsubdivisions (c) and (d) of this section. Additionally, if a leak has occurred\nin any portion of a tank system component that is not readily accessible for\nvisual inspection (\ne.g., the bottom of an inground or onground\ntank), the entire component must be provided with secondary containment in\naccordance with subdivision (d) of this section prior to being returned to\nuse. (6)\n\nCertification of\nmajor repairs. If the owner or operator has repaired a tank system in\naccordance with paragraph (5) of this subdivision, and the repair has been\nextensive (\ne.g., installation of an internal liner; repair of\na ruptured primary containment or secondary containment vessel), the tank\nsystem must not be returned to service unless the owner/operator has obtained a\ncertification by an independent, qualified, professional engineer registered in\n\nNew York in accordance with section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)(iv)\nof this Part that the repaired system is capable of handling hazardous wastes\nwithout release for the intended life of the system. This certification must be\nsubmitted to the department within seven days after returning the tank system\nto use. This certification must be placed in the operating record and\nmaintained until closure of the facility. Note: The commissioner may, on the basis of any information\nreceived that there is or has been a release of hazardous waste or hazardous\nconstituents into the environment, issue an order under ECL Article 71\nrequiring corrective action or such other response as deemed necessary to\nprotect human health or the environment. Note: See section\n373-2.2\n(g)(3)\nof\nthis Part for the requirements necessary to remedy a failure. Also, 40 CFR part\n302\nmay require the owner or operator to notify the National Response Center of\ncertain releases. (h) Closure and post-closure\ncare. (1)\n\nAt closure of a tank system, the owner or operator must remove or decontaminate all waste residues, contaminated containment system components (liners, etc.), contaminated soils, and structures and equipment contaminated with waste, and manage them as\nhazardous waste, unless section\n371.1\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Title applies. The closure plan, closure activities, cost estimates for\nclosure, and financial responsibility for tank systems must meet all of the\nrequirements specified in sections 373-2.7 and\n373-2.8\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nIf the owner or operator demonstrates\nthat not all contaminated soils can be practicably removed or decontaminated as\nrequired in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, then the owner or operator must\nclose the tank system and perform post-closure care in accordance with the\nclosure and post-closure care requirements that apply to landfills (see section\n373-2.14\n[g]\nof\nthis Subpart). In addition, for the purposes of closure, post-closure, and\nfinancial responsibility, such a tank system is then considered to be a\nlandfill, and the owner or operator must meet all of the requirements for\nlandfills specified in sections 373-2.7 and\n373-2.8\nof this Subpart. (3)\n\nIf an owner or operator has a tank system\nthat does not have secondary containment that meets the requirements of\nparagraphs (d)(2)-(6) of this section and has not been granted a variance from\nthe secondary containment requirements in accordance with paragraph (d)(7) of\nthis section, then: (i) the closure plan for\nthe tank system must include both a plan for complying with paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision and a contingent plan for complying with paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision; (ii)\na contingent\npost-closure plan for complying with paragraph (2) of this subdivision must be\nprepared and submitted as part of the permit application; (iii)\nthe cost estimates calculated for\nclosure and post-closure care must reflect the costs of complying with the\ncontingent closure plan and the contingent post-closure plan, if those costs\nare greater than the costs of complying with the closure plan prepared for the\nexpected closure under paragraph (1) of this subdivision; (iv)\nfinancial assurance must be based on the\ncost estimates in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph; and\n(v) for the purposes of the contingent\nclosure and post-closure plans, such a tank system is considered to be a\nlandfill, and the contingent plans must meet all of the closure, post- closure, and financial responsibility requirements for landfills under sections 373-2.7\nand\n373-2.8\nof this\n\nSubpart. (i) Special requirements for ignitable or reactive wastes. (1)\n\nIgnitable or reactive waste must not be\nplaced in tank systems, unless: (i) the waste\nis treated, rendered, or mixed before or immediately after placement in the\ntank system so that: (a) the resulting waste, mixture, or dissolved material no longer meets the definition of\nignitable\nor\nreactive waste\nunder section\n371.3\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(b) section\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with; (ii)\nthe waste is stored or treated in such a\nway that it is protected from any material or conditions that may cause the\nwaste to ignite or react; or\n(iii)\nthe tank system is used solely for emergencies. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator of a facility were\nignitable or reactive wastes are stored or treated in a tank must comply with\nthe requirements for the maintenance of protective distances between the waste\nmanagement area and any public ways, streets, alleys, or an adjoining property\nline that can be built upon as required in Tables 2-1 through 2-6 of the\n\nNational Fire Protection Association's \"Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code\"\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). (j) Special\nrequirements for incompatible wastes. (1)\n\nIncompatible wastes, or incompatible\nwastes and materials, must not be placed in the same tank system, unless\nsection\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (2)\n\nHazardous waste must not be placed in a tank system that has not been\ndecontaminated and that previously held an incompatible waste or material, unless section\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (k) Air emission standards. The owner or operator shall manage all hazardous waste placed in a tank in\naccordance with the applicable requirements of sections\n373-2.27, 373-2.28 and\n373-2.29\nof this Subpart. Notes\nN.Y.
