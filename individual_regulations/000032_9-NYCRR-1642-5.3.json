  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-5.3 - Collections and deposits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If\nprovision is made on the form of tenant's receipt for collections of both rent\nand security deposits (see Exhibit 21 of Appendix S-8), it will not be\nnecessary to issue separate receipts for the collection of security deposits. Reconciliation of security deposit collections shall be made daily. Procedures\nwith respect to safeguarding of funds, making up of deposits, etc. described in\nconnection with rent collections (see §\n1642-4.3, subd. [d]) apply with\nequal force to security deposit collections. (b) Security deposits should be separately\ndeposited in a security deposits fund bank account. In some situatitons, however, as where all moneys received at a project office are deposited in the\nadministration fund account, the security deposits fund account being\nmaintained by a central office, it will be permissible to deposit security\ndeposits, in the first instance, in the administration fund. In such instances, however, a separate deposit ticket, clearly marked \"Security Deposits\", should\nbe made out. Provision for the segregation, accumulation and control of\nsecurity deposit collections has been made in the tenants charge and credit\nbook (Exhibit 25, Appendix S-8). If security deposit collections have been\nmingled, in the first instance, with the other collections, the amount\ncollected shall be transferred at the end of each month by a check drawn on the\nadministration fund to the security deposits fund. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-5.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
