(2)\nasserted a claim or claims for payment of additional amounts beyond the total\nadjusted contract value and one or more of such claims are determined in whole\nor in part to be invalid under the contract's dispute resolution process or if\nno such process is specified in the contract in a final determination made by\nthe chief engineer or otherwise by the Authority, and together the sum of any\nsuch invalid claims exceeds by ten percent or more the total adjusted contract\nvalue. An invalid claim is a claim or claims that cannot be supported by the\nfacts or a nonfrivolous argument that it is warranted by the contract or\nexisting law. A claim for payment of additional amounts to a subcontractor that\na contractor is contractually obliged to submit to the Authority on behalf of\nsuch subcontractor that is determined to be invalid, shall not be deemed to be\nan invalid claim asserted by the contractor, and shall be deemed an invalid\nclaim submitted by the subcontractor. (3)\n\nThe Authority shall initiate a debarment\nproceeding upon determining that one or more grounds for debarment exist under\nsections\n1004.3\n(a)(1) or\n(a)(2), except that (i) if a contractor has\nmade a good faith request for an extension of the total adjusted time frame\nbecause of excusable delay or otherwise, which request, if granted by the\n\nAuthority, would eliminate grounds for debarment under provision (a)(1), the\n\nAuthority shall defer initiating a debarment proceeding until it has evaluated\nand determined such request; and (ii) the Authority may defer initiating, or\ndetermine not to initiate or pursue, a debarment proceeding for good cause\nshown, provided that the determination to defer or to not initiate or pursue a\ndebarment proceeding after grounds for debarment have been determined to exist\nis presented to the Authority's Board for ratification or nullification at the\nnext regularly scheduled meeting thereof. The Authority's Finance Committee\nshall be notified immediately upon a determination to defer initiating or not\ninitiate or pursue a debarment proceeding, and all such determinations to defer\ninitiating or to not initiate or pursue a debarment proceeding for good cause\nshown shall be presented to the Authority's Finance Committee for\nrecommendation before submission to the Board. In the event that a\ndetermination to defer initiating or to not initiate or pursue a debarment\nproceeding is rejected by the Board, Authority personnel shall immediately\ncommence a debarment proceeding.
