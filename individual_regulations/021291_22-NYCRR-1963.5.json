The court requires that a copy of the account be served with the citation on\nall parties in interest in the account. Proof of service must reflect such\nreceipt, as must any waiver and consent signed by a party in interest. Expenses\nfor photocopies and mailings of the account and citation shall be allowed as a\nlegal disbursement. 2. In order for an accounting to be\naccepted for filing by the court, the petition must state whether or not an\ninventory of assets pursuant to Rule 207.20 has been filed with the\ncourt. 3. In any\nestate with gross taxable assets in excess of $108,000, the petitioner may\neither cite the State Tax Commission as a party in interest or submit proof of\nfixation and payment of tax prior to the entry of a final decree. 4. Where it appears from the\npapers on file that either attorney fees or fiduciary commissions have been\nimproperly taken in advance of an accounting (restricted or limited letters), the petition must request that such advance payment be approved by the court\nnunc pro tunc. 5. The court will not permit general language approving the account in a waiver\nand consent signed by a party in interest. A waiver and consent by a residuary\nlegatee or distributee is not acceptable unless it specifically consents to\nevery prayer for relief set forth in the petition and citation. All other\ninterested parties need only specifically consent to relief which affects their\ninterest. 6. Where\nreal property is sold by a fiduciary, only the sum equal to the net proceeds of\nsale is to be included in Schedule A of the account and a copy of the closing\nstatement is to be submitted with the account. All expenses incurred in\nconnection with the sale and the satisfaction of outstanding liens must be\ndeducted from gross sale price prior to entry in Schedule A. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
