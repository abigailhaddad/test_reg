  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 400.8 - Determination of steam meter performance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When the results of two tests at a given\nload fail to agree within two percent, additional tests up to a total of four, shall be made at that load until agreement within two percent is obtained on\nany two tests. If such agreement is not obtained the meter registration shall\nbe reported as \"Indeterminate\". (b) The percentage registration shall be reported as \"Indeterminate\" when for any\nreason there is doubt as to whether the accuracy of registration can be\ndetermined. See subdivision (c) of this section. (c) The percentage registration shall be\nreported as \"Non-registering\" if for any reason a meter is found not\nregistering at the specified test points. See subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (d) The percentage\nregistration of the meter shall be determined by arithmetically averaging the\nresults obtained at the specified test points, except that for condensate\nmeters the percentage registration shall be obtained by multiplying the average\nof the test results at 50 percent of meter rating by two, adding the average of\nthe test results of 100 percent of meter rating and dividing the total by\nthree. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n400.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
