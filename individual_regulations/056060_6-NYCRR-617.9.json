  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 617.9 - Preparation and content of environmental impact statements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Environmental impact statement\nprocedures. (1)\n\nThe project sponsor or the\nlead agency, at the project sponsor's option, will prepare the draft EIS. If\nthe project sponsor does not exercise the option to prepare the draft EIS, the\nlead agency will prepare it, cause it to be prepared or terminate its review of\nthe action. A fee may be charged by the lead agency for preparation or review\nof an EIS pursuant to section\n617.13\nof this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nThe lead agency will use\nthe final written scope and the standards contained in this section to\ndetermine whether to accept the draft EIS as adequate with respect to its scope\nand content for the purpose of commencing public review. This determination\nmust be made in accordance with the standards in this section within 45 days of\nreceipt of the draft EIS. A draft EIS is adequate with respect to scope and\ncontent for the purpose of commencing public review if it meets the\nrequirements of the final written scope, sections\n617.8\n(g) and\n617.9\n(b) of this Part, and provides the public and involved agencies with\nthe necessary information to evaluate project impacts, alternatives, and\nmitigation measures. (i) If the draft EIS is\ndetermined to be inadequate, the lead agency must identify in writing the\ndeficiencies and provide this information to the project sponsor. (ii)\n\nThe lead agency must determine whether\nto accept the resubmitted draft EIS within 30 days of its receipt. The\ndetermination of adequacy of a resubmitted draft EIS must be based solely on\nthe written list of deficiencies provided by the lead agency following the\nprevious review. (3)\n\nWhen the lead agency has completed a draft EIS or when it has determined that a\ndraft EIS prepared by a project sponsor is adequate for public review, the lead\nagency must prepare, file and publish a notice of completion of the draft EIS\nand file copies of the draft EIS in accordance with the requirements set forth\nin section\n617.12\nof this Part. The minimum public comment period on the draft EIS is 30 days. The comment period begins with the first filing and circulation of the notice\nof completion. (4)\n\nWhen the lead\nagency has completed a draft EIS or when it has determined that a draft EIS\nprepared by a project sponsor is adequate for public review, the lead agency\nwill determine whether or not to conduct a public hearing concerning the\naction. In determining whether or not to hold a SEQR hearing, the lead agency\nwill consider: the degree of interest in the action shown by the public or\ninvolved agencies; whether substantive or significant adverse environmental\nimpacts have been identified; the adequacy of the mitigation measures and\nalternatives proposed; and the extent to which a public hearing can aid the\nagency decision-making processes by providing a forum for, or an efficient\nmechanism for the collection of, public comment. If a hearing is to be held: (i) the lead agency must prepare and file a\nnotice of hearing in accordance with section\n617.12\n(a) and (b)\nof this Part. Such notice may be\ncontained in the notice of completion of the draft EIS. The notice of hearing\nmust be published, at least 14 calendar days in advance of the public hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the area of the potential impacts of\nthe action. For state agency actions that apply statewide, this requirement can\nbe satisfied by publishing the hearing notice in the ENB and the State\n\nRegister; (ii)\nthe hearing will\ncommence no less than 15 calendar days or no more than 60 calendar days after\nthe filing of the notice of completion of the draft EIS by the lead agency\npursuant to section\n617.12\n(b) of this Part. When a SEQR hearing is to be held, it should be conducted with\nother public hearings on the proposed action, whenever practicable; and\n(iii)\ncomments will be received\nand considered by the lead agency for no less than 30 calendar days from the\nfirst filing and circulation of the notice of completion, or no less than 10\ncalendar days following a public hearing at which the environmental impacts of\nthe proposed action are considered, whichever is later. (5)\n\nExcept as provided in subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph, the lead agency must prepare or cause to be prepared, and must\nfile a final EIS, within 45 calendar days after the close of any hearing or\nwithin 60 calendar days after the filing of the draft EIS, whichever occurs\nlater. (i) No final EIS need be prepared if: (a) the proposed action has been withdrawn\nor; (b) on the basis of the draft\nEIS, and comments made thereon, the lead agency has determined that the action\nwill not have a significant adverse impact on the environment. A negative\ndeclaration must then be prepared, filed and published in accordance with\nsection\n617.12\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nThe\nlast date for preparation and filing of the final EIS may be extended under the\nfollowing circumstances: (a) if it is\ndetermined that additional time is necessary to prepare the statement\nadequately; or\n(b) if problems with\nthe proposed action requiring material reconsideration or modification have\nbeen identified. (6)\n\nWhen the lead agency has completed a\nfinal EIS, it must prepare, file and publish a notice of completion of the\nfinal EIS and file copies of the final EIS in accordance with section\n617.12\nof this Part. (7)\n\nSupplemental\nEISs. (i) The lead agency may require a\nsupplemental EIS, limited to the specific significant adverse environmental\nimpacts not addressed or inadequately addressed in the EIS that arise from: (a) changes proposed for the\nproject; (b) newly discovered\ninformation; or\n(c) a change in\ncircumstances related to the project. (ii)\n\nThe decision to require preparation of a\nsupplemental EIS, in the case of newly discovered information, must be based\nupon the following criteria: (a) the\nimportance and relevance of the information; and\n(b) the present state of the information in\nthe EIS. (iii)\n\nIf a\nsupplement is required, it will be subject to the full procedural requirements\nof section\n617.9\n(a) of this Part except that scoping is not required. (b) Environmental impact\nstatement content. (1)\n\nAn EIS must assemble\nrelevant and material facts upon which an agency's decision is to be made. It\nmust analyze the significant adverse impacts and evaluate all reasonable\nalternatives. EISs must be analytical and not encyclopedic. The lead agency and\nother involved agencies must cooperate with project sponsors who are preparing\nEISs by making available to them information contained in their files relevant\nto the EIS. (2)\nEISs must be\nclearly and concisely written in plain language that can be read and understood\nby the public. Within the framework presented in paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision, EISs should address only those potential significant adverse\nenvironmental impacts that can be reasonably anticipated and that have been\nidentified in the scoping process. EISs should not contain more detail than is\nappropriate considering the nature and magnitude of the proposed action and the\nsignificance of its potential impacts. Highly technical material should be\nsummarized and, if it must be included in its entirety, should be referenced in\nthe statement and included in an appendix. (3)\n\nAll draft and final EISs must be preceded\nby a cover sheet stating: (i) whether it is a\ndraft or final EIS; (ii)\nthe name\nor descriptive title of the action; (iii)\nthe location (county and town, village\nor city) and street address, if applicable, of the action; (iv)\nthe name and address of the lead agency\nand the contact information of a person at the agency who can provide further\ninformation; (v) the names of\nindividuals or organizations that prepared any portion of the\nstatement; (vi)\nthe date of its\nacceptance by the lead agency; and\n(vii)\nin the case of a draft EIS, the date by\nwhich comments must be submitted. (4)\nA draft or final EIS must have a table of\ncontents following the cover sheet and a precise summary which adequately and\naccurately summarizes the statement. (5)\n\nThe format of the draft EIS may be\nflexible; however, all draft EISs must include the following elements: (i) a concise description of the proposed\naction, its purpose, public need and benefits, including social and economic\nconsiderations; (ii)\na concise\ndescription of the environmental setting of the areas to be affected, sufficient to understand the impacts of the proposed action and\nalternatives; (iii)\na statement and\nevaluation of the potential significant adverse environmental impacts at a\nlevel of detail that reflects the severity of the impacts and the reasonable\nlikelihood of their occurrence. The draft EIS should identify and discuss the\nfollowing impacts only where they are relevant and significant: (a) reasonably related short-term and\nlong-term impacts, cumulative impacts and other associated environmental\nimpacts; (b) those adverse\nenvironmental impacts that cannot be avoided or adequately mitigated if the\nproposed action is implemented; (c) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of environmental resources that\nwould be associated with the proposed action should it be\nimplemented; (d) any\ngrowth-inducing aspects of the proposed action; (e) impacts of the proposed action on the use\nand conservation of energy including the use of renewable energy sources (for\nan electric generating facility, the statement must include a demonstration\nthat the facility will satisfy electric generating capacity needs or other\nelectric systems needs in a manner reasonably consistent with the most recent\nstate energy plan); (f) impacts of\nthe proposed action on solid waste management and its consistency with the\nstate or locally adopted solid waste management plan; (g) impacts of public acquisitions of land or\ninterests in land or funding for non-farm development on lands used in\nagricultural production and unique and irreplaceable agricultural lands within\nagricultural districts pursuant to subdivision (4) of section 305 of article\n25-AA of the Agriculture and Markets Law; (h) if the proposed action is in or involves\nresources in Nassau or Suffolk Counties, impacts of the proposed action on, and\nits consistency with, the comprehensive management plan for the special\ngroundwater protection area program as implemented pursuant to article 55 or\nany plan subsequently ratified and adopted pursuant to article 57 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law for Nassau and Suffolk counties; and\n(i) measures to avoid or reduce both an\naction's environmental impacts and vulnerability from the effects of climate\nchange such as sea level rise and flooding. (iv)\na description of the mitigation\nmeasures; (v) a description and\nevaluation of the range of reasonable alternatives to the action that are\nfeasible, considering the objectives and capabilities of the project sponsor. The description and evaluation of each alternative should be at a level of\ndetail sufficient to permit a comparative assessment of the alternatives\ndiscussed. The range of alternatives must include the no action alternative. The no action alternative discussion should evaluate the adverse or beneficial\nsite changes that are likely to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future, in\nthe absence of the proposed action. The range of alternatives may also include, as appropriate, alternative: (a) sites; (b) technology; (c) scale or magnitude; (d) design; (e) timing; (f) use; and\n(g) types of action. For private project sponsors, any alternative for which no\ndiscretionary approvals are needed may be described. Site alternatives may be\nlimited to parcels owned by, or under option to, a private project\nsponsor; (vi)\nfor a state agency action in the coastal area the action's consistency: with\nthe applicable coastal policies contained in 19 NYCRR\n600.5; or when the action\nis in an approved local waterfront revitalization program area, with the local\nprogram policies; (vii)\nfor a state\nagency action within a heritage area or urban cultural park, the action's\nconsistency with the approved heritage area management plan or the approved\nurban cultural park management plan; (viii)\na list of any underlying studies, reports, EISs and other information obtained and considered in preparing the\nstatement including the final written scope. (6)\n\nIn addition to the analysis of\nsignificant adverse impacts required in subparagraph (b)(5)(iii) of this\nsection, if information about reasonably foreseeable catastrophic impacts to\nthe environment is unavailable because the cost to obtain it is exorbitant, or\nthe means to obtain it are unknown, or there is uncertainty about its validity, and such information is essential to an agency's SEQR findings, the EIS must: (i) identify the nature and relevance of\nunavailable or uncertain information; (ii)\nprovide a summary of existing credible\nscientific evidence, if available; and\n(iii)\nassess the likelihood of occurrence, even if the probability of occurrence is low, and the consequences of the\npotential impact, using theoretical approaches or research methods generally\naccepted in the scientific community. This analysis would likely occur in the review of such\nactions as an oil supertanker port, a liquid propane gas/liquid natural gas\nfacility, or the siting of a hazardous waste treatment facility. It does not\napply in the review of such actions as shopping malls, residential subdivisions\nor office facilities. (7)\nA draft or final EIS may incorporate by\nreference all or portions of other documents, including EISs that contain\ninformation relevant to the statement. The referenced documents must be made\navailable for inspection by the public within the time period for public\ncomment in the same places where the agency makes available copies of the EIS. When an EIS incorporates by reference, the referenced document must be briefly\ndescribed, its applicable findings summarized, and the date of its preparation\nprovided. (8)\nA final EIS must\nconsist of the following: the draft EIS, including any revisions or supplements\nto it; copies or a summary of the substantive comments received and their\nsource (whether or not the comments were received in the context of a hearing); and the lead agency's responses to all substantive comments. The draft EIS may\nbe directly incorporated into the final EIS or may be incorporated by\nreference. The lead agency is responsible for the adequacy and accuracy of the\nfinal EIS, regardless of who prepares it. All substantive revisions and\nsupplements to the draft EIS must be specifically indicated and identified as\nsuch in the final EIS. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
