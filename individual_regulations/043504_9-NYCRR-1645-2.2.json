  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-2.2 - Acquisition of investments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nmaking of an investment of funds in the custody of a local agency should be\nauthorized by resolution of the local agency. No investment shall, however, be\nmade without the prior approval of the division. (b) The accounting treatment of the elements\ninvolved in the acquisition of investments is as follows: Element\n\nAccounting\ntreatment\n\nPurchase price\n\nCharge to the appropriate account in the 1170, Investments, group of asset accounts. Premium or discount\n\nDo not set up on acquisition, but amortize over\nholding period as described in section\n1645-2.3. Accrued interest purchased\n\nCharge to account 1144, Accrued Interest\n\nReceivable on Investments. Expenses of acquisition\n\nCharge directly to the same account that the\ninterest earned on the investment will be credited to. See section\n1645-2.4. (c) The\npurchase price\nof\nthe investment means the actual price paid by the local agency on acquisition, exclusive of accrued interest purchased or expenses of acquisition, such as\nbrokers commissions, postage, registry and insurance fees, etc., if any. The\npremium or discount\nis the difference between the purchase\nprice and the face value of the investment. With respect to the expenses of\nacquisition, many banks will handle the purchase of U.S. government securities\nwithout charging brokerage commissions. The division will be glad to advise\nlocal agencies experiencing difficulty in this respect. There may, however, be\na charge, in the case of upstate local agencies, to cover the out-of-pocket\nexpenses for telephone, postage, insurance and registry fees for mailing the\nsecurities from New York. All the information required to reflect the\nacquisition of investments on the books will appear on the statement furnished\nby the bank or broker handling the transaction. Prices of bonds are either\nquoted on a yield basis, or on the basis of so much per $1,000 face value, but\nthe statement should also show the purchase price in dollars. The accounting\ntreatment of the acquisition of investments is illustrated in the following\nexample. Assume that on June 6, 1948 a local agency bought, through a bank, $1,648,000 face value of one-year one and one-quarter per cent U.S. Certificates of Indebtedness, issued June 1, 1948, to yield 1.21 per cent. The\ninvestment was made for the development fund and the bank's statement of the\ntransaction shows that the accrued interest purchased from the date of issue to\nthe date of purchase, is $282.19 and that the purchase price, based on the 1.21\nper cent yield, was $1,648,692.47. The bank made a charge of $32.85 for\npostage. The entry recording this transaction would be made through the cash\ndisbursements-voucher register, as follows: Entry (1): Debit: Account 1172, Development\n\nFund Investments\n$1,648,692.47....................................................................................................... Debit: Account 1144, Accrued Interest\n\nReceivable on Investments\n$\n282.19\n\nDebit: Account 1420.1, Interest Expense\n$\n32.85\n\nCredit: Account 1111, Development Fund\n$1,649,007.51........................................................................ Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1645-2.2\n\nThe same entry would be made if the above transaction\nrepresented a direct application by bank of the proceeds of a temporary loan\nnote issue (see Part 1643, Financing). State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
