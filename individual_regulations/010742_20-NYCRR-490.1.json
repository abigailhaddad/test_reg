  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 490.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 522, 523, 526(d), 528, 1815(a)\n(a) A fuel use tax is imposed, pursuant to\narticle 21-A of the Tax Law, for the privilege of operating qualified motor\nvehicles (as defined herein) on the public highways of New York State. The\nliability for the fuel use tax is upon the carrier, except that where the\ncarrier is not the owner of the qualified motor vehicle the tax is a joint and\nseveral liability upon both the carrier and the owner. (b) (1)\n\nWith specific exceptions, article 21-A of the Tax Law also requires that a fuel\nuse tax license and decal(s) be obtained for every qualified motor vehicle that\nis operated or to be operated on the public highways of New York State. Such a\nqualified motor vehicle must have a fuel use tax license and decal(s), regardless of whether it is registered in New York State or in any other state\nor jurisdiction, and regardless of whether it is engaged in intrastate, interstate or foreign commerce. The Department of Taxation and Finance may\nauthorize or require different forms of licenses and decals depending upon the\ntype of commerce in which the carrier is engaged. (2)\n\nIt is unlawful for any person to use (or\ncause or permit to be used) any public highway in this State for the operation\nof a qualified motor vehicle that is subject to the provisions of article 21-A\nof the Tax Law without first obtaining a license and decal(s) as required under\nsuch article. The operation of any such qualified motor vehicle on any public\nhighway of this State without carrying therein the fuel use tax license, or\ndisplaying thereon the fuel use tax decal(s), shall be presumptive evidence\nthat a license or decal(s) has not been obtained for that qualified motor\nvehicle. (c) Article\n21-A of the Tax Law authorizes the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance to\nenter into a cooperative agreement for the administration of the fuel use tax\nimposed by that article and similar taxes imposed by other jurisdictions and\nfor the reporting and payment of such taxes to a single base state and\ndistribution of those taxes among the jurisdictions where a qualified motor\nvehicle is operated. Under that authority, the commissioner entered into the\n\nInternational Fuel Tax Agreement (hereinafter referred to as \"IFTA\") on\n\nDecember 30, 1994, with full implementation of its provisions beginning on\n\nJanuary 1, 1996. The IFTA sets forth provisions relating to determining the\nbase state for carriers, records requirements for carriers, persons eligible\nfor licensing, the definition of qualified motor vehicles, bonding\nrequirements, reporting requirements and periods, uniform penalty and interest\nrates for late reporting or late payment, notice and timing of hearings and\nother provisions needed to facilitate the administration of the IFTA. This\n\nArticle reflects the provisions of article 21-A of the Tax Law and of the IFTA. Section 528(d) of article 21-A of such law requires that the commissioner\ncarryout the provisions of the IFTA, including any changes to the IFTA, to the\nextent such provisions (or amendments) are not in direct conflict with the\nprovisions of such article 21-A. (d) The carrier tax imposed pursuant to\narticle 13-A of the Tax Law, the highway use taxes imposed pursuant to article\n21 of such law and the fuel use tax imposed pursuant to article 21-A of such\nlaw are, to the extent practicable, to be administered on a joint basis, including the joint reporting and payment, assessment, collection, determination, refund or credit of such taxes.
