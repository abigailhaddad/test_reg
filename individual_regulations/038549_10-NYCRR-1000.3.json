(b) Public\ndissemination. (1)\n\nThe department shall make\navailable to the public information collected in accordance with subdivision\n(a) of this section regarding: (i) all\nmedical malpractice court judgments and arbitration awards within the most\nrecent 10 years in which a payment has been awarded or made to a complaining\nparty; and\n(ii)\nmalpractice\nsettlements which exceed two in number within the most recent 10 years in which\na payment has been awarded or made to a complaining party. (2)\n\nIn the case where the total number of\nmalpractice settlements is two or fewer, the department shall make available to\nthe public information collected in accordance with subdivision (a) of this\nsection in those cases where it is alleged that a malpractice event resulted in\ndeath or permanent injury, and where the department has considered any\ninformation submitted in accordance with subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (i) Permanent injury shall include, but not\nbe limited to, the following: (a) loss of\nfinger or fingers; (b) loss or\npermanent damage to organ or organs; (c) deafness; (d) loss of any limb or limbs; (e) loss of eyes or eyesight; (f) loss of kidney or kidneys; (g) loss of lung or lungs; (h) paraplegia; (i) brain damage; (j) quadriplegia; (k) severe brain damage; (l) lifelong care; (m) fatal prognosis; (n) any permanent loss or impairment (unable\nto function at same level prior to occurrence) of body part; (o) any permanent loss or impairment of\nbodily function; (p) any permanent\nphysical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of the\nmajor life activities of an individual; or\n(q) death. For purposes of this subparagraph, the Department of Health\nmay use information collected in accordance with section\n315\nof the\n\nInsurance Law, including information relating to death or the seriousness of\ninjury, or self-reported by physicians as required by subdivision (3) of\nsection\n2995-a\nof\nthe Public Health Law. (ii)\n(ii)\n(a) A physician may provide additional\nfactual clinical information pertinent to the department's determination of\nwhether settlement information is relevant to patient decisionmaking. Such\ninformation, if provided, will be reviewed by a panel appointed by the\ndepartment to conduct such reviews. The panel is comprised of at least three\npersons, the majority of whom are physicians, at least one of whom is a\nphysician of the same specialty as the physician whose settlement is under\nreview. The panel shall submit its recommendation to the Commissioner of Health\nregarding whether, based upon the information provided by the physician whose\nsettlement is under review, the settlement is relevant to patient\ndecisionmaking. The recommendation of the panel that a settlement is not\nrelevant for patient decisionmaking shall be predicated upon a preponderance of\nclinical information indicating that, despite the awarding of a payment to a\ncomplaining party, appropriate provision of patient care was\nprovided. (b) Additional clinical\ninformation provided by a physician must be received by the department\npostmarked within 30 days of the date of the letter transmitting the\nphysician's medical malpractice review copy as specified in section\n1000.4\n(c) of this\n\nPart. Requests for an extension of the 30-day period will be considered only if\nthey: (1)\nare in writing and received by the\ndepartment or its agent within the 30- day period or received orally by the\ndepartment or its agent within the 30-day period followed by a written request\nfor the extension postmarked within five days of the department receiving the\noral request or the expiration of the 30- day period, whichever is\nlater; (2)\ninclude the reason(s)\nwhy the extension is needed, which must be related to circumstances that are\nbeyond the physician's control; and\n(3)\nindicate the amount of additional time\nneeded. This clause does not obligate the department to grant\nextensions. Further, the department may deny any request received beyond the\nrequired time frames or missing information required by subclauses (1)-(3) of\nthis clause. Public dissemination of medical malpractice settlement information\nwill be suspended while the department is reviewing the request for an\nextension. The department will notify the physician in writing of its decision\nto either grant or deny an extension. (iii)\n\nConsumers shall be advised by the\ndepartment on a physician profile to contact the physician for more information\nregarding malpractice awards, judgments and settlements in order to facilitate\npatient decisionmaking concerning health care quality. (3)\n\nPublic dissemination of\ninformation regarding medical malpractice judgments, arbitration awards, and\nsettlements under this section shall be made in graduated categories indicating\nwhether the payment award is average, above average or below average, as set\nforth in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, in comparison to other payment\nawards made to complaining parties within the same specialty. For purposes of\nthis paragraph, specialty shall mean a specified area of medical practice\nincluding, but not limited to, anesthesiology, family practice, internal\nmedicine, obstetrics and gynecology, pediatrics, physical medicine and\nrehabilitation, psychiatry, radiology and general surgery. For purposes of\ncomparing payment awards, the department may calculate average, above average\nand below average amounts, and periodically update them, at least annually, based upon the most recent malpractice payment award information submitted to\nthe department by medical malpractice insurance companies or hospitals\nself-insured for professional medical malpractice in accordance with section\n315\nof the\n\nInsurance Law, consistent with geographic areas of the State used by the\n\nInsurance Department to establish medical malpractice insurance premiums, as\nset forth in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. Average, above average, and\nbelow average amounts are based upon quartiles. Quartiles are developed by\ntaking all claims for doctors within a certain specialty in a certain\ngeographic region and dividing them, lowest to highest, into four groups\n(quartiles) of equal numbers. (i) (i) (a) An\naverage payment award means a payment award amount falling in the middle two\nquartiles of payment award amounts for a certain specialty in a certain\ngeographic region. (b) A below\naverage payment award means a payment award amount falling in the lowest\nquartile of payment award amounts for a certain specialty in a certain\ngeographic region. (c) An above\naverage payment award means a payment award amount in the highest quartile of\npayment award amounts for a certain specialty in a certain geographic\nregion. (ii)\n(ii)\n(a) If there are at least eight claims in\neach of four regions, quartiles will be developed for each of four regions for\na particular specialty as follows: Region A = New York, Orange, Rockland, Sullivan, Westchester, Bronx, Kings, Queens, Richmond, Nassau and Suffolk Counties\n\nRegion B = Columbia, Dutchess, Greene, Putnam and Ulster\n\nCounties\n\nRegion C = Erie and Niagara Counties\n\nRegion D = All Other Counties\n(b) If there are an insufficient number of\nclaims to develop quartiles for each of four regions as specified in clause (a)\nof this subparagraph, then quartiles will be developed for each of two regions\nfor a specialty if there are at least eight claims in each of two regions as\nfollows: Downstate = Region A\nUpstate = Combined Regions B, C, and D\n(c) If there is an insufficient number of\nclaims to develop quartiles for downstate and upstate, quartiles will be\ndeveloped on a statewide basis for a specialty. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n1000.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
