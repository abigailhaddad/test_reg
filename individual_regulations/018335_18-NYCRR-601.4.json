  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 601.4 - Claim adjudication\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department will be responsible for examining claims\nfor reimbursement submitted by social services districts. Initial\ndeterminations objecting to the allowability of a claim for reimbursement will\nbe made in a timely manner not to exceed 90 days from the time of receipt by\nthe department, unless the department notifies a district that a specified\namount of additional time, not to exceed an additional 90 days, is necessary to\ncomplete examination of the claim. Any portion of a claim to which there is no\ninitial determination objecting to allowability will be processed for\nsubmission for acceptance by a reimbursement authority. Processing will be\ncommenced in a timely manner not to exceed 90 days from the time of receipt of\nthe claim or from the date of an initial determination of allowability. A\ndetermination by the department concerning the allowability of a claim for\nreimbursement submitted by a social services district is final and is not\nsubject to administrative review. (a) Acceptance or payment by the department of any portion of any claim for such\nreimbursement does not preclude the department from subsequently examining any\nportion of such claim and determining that such claim was not subject to\nreimbursement or should have been reimbursed at a different rate. (b) Acceptance by the district of\nreimbursement from the department related to specific reimbursable costs\nclaimed by the district precludes the district from subsequently submitting any\nadditional claims for reimbursement for such costs without the consent of the\ndepartment. (c) Acceptance by a\nsocial services district of a determination by the department with respect to\nthe allowability of costs or other items purported to be subject to\nreimbursement on any portion of any claim precludes the district from\nsubmitting any additional claims for reimbursement relating to such costs or\nitems without the consent of the department. (d) Any portion of any costs or other items\npurported to be subject to reimbursement which are determined to be\nunacceptable by the department may not be resubmitted for reimbursement or\notherwise adjusted without the explicit consent of the department. (e) The department may request the district\nto submit, or at the department's option prepare on behalf of the district, a\nstatement of adjustments to any portion of any claim submitted by a district. Any adjustments made by the department to payments or claims for the district\nconstitutes notification of the adjustment when the district receives a copy of\nthe adjustment or has been notified that the adjustment has been\nmade. (f) Any disallowances, recoupments or adjustments resulting from the action or determination of a\n\nFederal or other reimbursement authority must be reflected in adjustments to\nclaims as directed by the department. A copy of any adjustments made by the\ndepartment constitutes notification to the district of the adjustments when the\ndistrict receives a copy of the adjustment or is notified that the adjustment\nhas been made. If the determination of the Federal or other reimbursement\nauthority is not final or binding, or if the department has appealed or\njudicially challenged such determination and the district is so notified, the\ndetermination of the department with respect to the district shall not be final\nand binding until the determination is final and binding upon the department\nand the district is so notified. (g) Any adjustments resulting from a\npost-claim review or audit must be reflected in adjustments to claims as\ndirected by the department. A copy of any adjustments made by the department\nconstitutes notification to the district of the adjustment when the district\nreceives a copy of the adjustment or has been notified that the adjustment has\nbeen made. (h) Any other\nreductions, recoupments or adjustments must be reflected in adjustments to\nclaims as directed by the department. Such reductions, recoupments or\nadjustments when made by the department are final and binding when the district\nis notified that the reduction, recoupment or adjustment has been or will be\nmade.
