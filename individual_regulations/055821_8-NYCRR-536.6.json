  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 536.6 - Picketing and demonstrations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In\nregard to on-campus student actions and demonstrations that tend to endanger\nlife, public or private property or to violate local, State or Federal laws, each student will take the consequence of his or own actions as an individual\nbefore the law, as well as being referred to the appropriate university\ndisciplinary body. The cost of any damage to public or private property must be\nborne by those legally responsible. (b) All members of a university community\nmust share the responsibility for maintaining a climate in which diverse views\ncan be expressed freely and without harassment. (c) The State University of New York at\n\nBuffalo has traditionally supported the right of its students, faculty and\nstaff to peaceful protest. Always implicit is the understanding that\ndemonstrators will not interfere with or violate the rights of others. It is\nthe obligation of all to assist in maintaining order and to assure courteous\nreception of any campus speaker or visitor. (d) The following pertains to the conduct of\nthose members of the university community who feel compelled to express their\ndissent through picketing and other forms of demonstration: (1)\n\nPicketing and demonstrating must be\norderly at all times and should in no way jeopardize public order or safety or\ninterfere with the university's programs. (2)\n\nPicketing or demonstrating must not\ninterfere with entrances to buildings or the normal flow of pedestrian or\nvehicular traffic. (3)\n\nThose\ninvolved in picketing or demonstrating may not interfere by mingling with\norganized meetings or other assemblies for the purpose of harassment, since\nthis invades the rights of others to assemble and the rights of speakers to\nfree expression. (4)\n\nPicketing or\ndemonstrating may not obstruct or physically interfere with the integrity of\nthe classroom, the privacy of the residence halls, or the functioning of the\nphysical plant.
