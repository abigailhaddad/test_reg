  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.363 - Service lines: valve requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each service line must have a service line valve that meets the applicable\nrequirements of this Part. A valve incorporated in a meter bar that allows the\nmeter to be bypassed may not be used as a service line valve. All such exposed\nvalves must be of tamper proof construction. (b) A soft seat service line valve may not be\nused if its ability to control the flow of gas could be adversely affected by\nexposure to anticipated heat. (c) Each service line valve on a high pressure service line, installed aboveground\nor in an area where the blowing of gas would be hazardous, must be designed and\nconstructed to minimize the possibility of the removal of the core of the valve\nwith other than specialized tools. (d) On service lines designed to operate at\npressures in excess of 60 psig (414 kPa), the service line valve shall be the\nequivalent of a pressure lubricated valve or a needle type valve. Other types\nof valves may be used where tests by the manufacturer or by the user indicate\nthat they are suitable for this kind of service. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.363\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
