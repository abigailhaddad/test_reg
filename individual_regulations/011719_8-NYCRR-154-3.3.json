(2)\n\nIn making this recommendation, the LPT\nshall, in accordance with guidance prescribed by the commissioner, consider\nevidence of the student's English language development, including, but not\nlimited to: (i) the results of steps 1 and 2\nin section\n154-2.3\n(a)(1) and\n(2)\nof this Part; (ii)\nin the student's history of language use\nin school and home or community; (iii)\nthe individual evaluation of the\nstudent conducted in accordance with the procedures in Part 200.4(b)(6) of this\n\nTitle, which shall include assessments administered in the student's home\nlanguage; and\n(iv)\ninformation\nprovided by the Committee on Special Education (CSE) as to whether the\nstudent's disability is the determinant factor affecting whether the student\ncan demonstrate proficiency in English. (3)\n\nBased on the evidence reviewed in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, the LPT must make a recommendation as to\nwhether student may have second language acquisition needs or whether the\nstudent's disability is the determinant factor affecting whether the student\ncould demonstrate proficiency in English during step 2 in section\n154-2.3\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Part. (4)\n\nIf the LPT\nrecommends that the student does not have second language acquisition needs and\ntherefore should not take the English language proficiency identification\nassessment to identify the student as an English language learner, such\nrecommendation shall be referred to the school principal for review. (5)\n\nIf, upon review, the school principal\nagrees with the recommendation of the LPT that the student is not an English\n\nLanguage Learner and will not take the English language proficiency\nidentification assessment, the school principal shall inform the parent or\nperson in parental relation of this recommendation, in the language or mode of\ncommunication the parent or person in parental relation best\nunderstands. (6)\n\nUpon receipt of a\nrecommendation by the school principal, the Superintendent or his or her\ndesignee shall review the school principal's recommendation and make a final\ndetermination to accept or reject the school principal's recommendation within\nten (10) days of receiving the school principal's recommendation. If the\n\nSuperintendent determines that the student is not an English Language Learner, notice of such determination shall be provided to the parent or person in\nparental relation in the language or mode of communication the parent or person\nin parental relation best understands within five days of such final\ndetermination. (7)\n\nIf the LPT\ndetermines that the student with a disability may have second language\nacquisition needs, the student shall take the initial English language\nproficiency identification assessment. The CSE shall determine, in accordance\nwith the individualized education program (lEP) developed for such student\npursuant to Part 200 of this Title, whether the student shall take the\nassessment with or without testing accommodations or an alternate assessment as\nmay be prescribed by the commissioner.
