(b) Notice of rejection of claim. A Notice of\n\nTotal or Partial Rejection of Claim for Disability Benefits (in the format\nprescribed by the Chair) sent to the claimant within 18 days of receipt of\nproof of disability shall satisfy the employer or carrier's obligation to send\na notice of denial of claim pursuant to subdivision (a) of this\nsection.

Any inquiry made thereafter must be made no more than two weeks prior to the\ndate of expiration of the proof of disability. Such inquiry shall include a\nclear and prominent statement of the deadline of at least 2 weeks for\nresponding and consequences of failing to respond. Disability caused by or in\nconnection with a pregnancy shall be presumed for the four weeks prior to the\nchild's estimated due date and for the six weeks after giving birth or eight\nweeks after delivering by Cesarean section. (d) The carrier or self-insured employer may\ndeny the claim without prejudice for the following reasons: (1)\nincomplete Notice and Proof of Claim for\n\nDisability Benefits; or\n(2)\ninsufficient certification of disability. (e) If the claim is denied without prejudice\ndue to an incomplete claim package, the carrier or self-insured employer must\nnotify the employee of each piece of required information, as identified on the\n\nNotice and Proof of Claim for Disability Benefits (in the format prescribed by\nthe Chair), which is missing from the employee's claim for benefits. If the\nclaim is not refiled within 30 days from when leave was first taken, the\ncarrier or self-insured employer may deny the claim.

Whenever a claim for benefits is the responsibility of the\nspecial fund for disability benefits pursuant to section\n213\nof the Workers' Compensation Law, the chair may waive the special fund for\ndisability benefits' obligation to pay without prejudice; (ii)\nwhen a basis for denial is lack of\ninsurance coverage, the insurance carrier shall provide the Board with a copy\nof the denial; (8)\ndisability arose out of and in the course of the employee's employment as\nevidenced by a workers' compensation claim number, if available, or by\nproviding the employer's name and date of accident or date of\ndisablement. (g) Failure\nof the employer to complete, or inadequate completion by the employer, of the\nemployer section on the Notice and Proof of Claim for Disability Benefits is\nnot a valid basis for denial by the carrier. (h) If the employee is eligible to receive\nbenefits at the time of submission of the Notice and Proof of Claim for\n\nDisability Benefits with the carrier, the carrier or self-insured employer must\naccept the claim and make payment to the employee within 18 days.
