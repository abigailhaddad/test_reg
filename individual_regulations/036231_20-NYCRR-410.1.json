  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 410.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 283(1), 284, 284-b, 289-c\n(a) (1)\n\nUnless registered as a distributor of motor fuel under article 12-A of the Tax\n\nLaw, no person may (i) import or cause any motor fuel to be imported into New\n\nYork State for use, distribution, storage or sale in the State, or (ii)\nproduce, refine, manufacture or compound motor fuel within the State. (2)\n\nNo distributor, unless so registered, may\nmake any sale, transfer, use or other disposition of motor fuel within the\n\nState, except a sale, transfer, use or other disposition, if any, as to which\nthe State cannot impose such condition by reason of the United States\n\nConstitution or any laws enacted thereto. (b) In general, every distributor of motor\nfuel must pay an aggregate excise tax of eight cents per gallon on each gallon\nof motor fuel which it (1) imports or causes to be imported into this State for\nuse, distribution, storage or sale in the State, (2) produces, refines, manufactures or compounds in this State or (3) sells in this State if the tax\nwas not imposed prior to such sale in the State. Such tax, though payable by\nthe distributor, is ultimately borne by the purchaser of the motor fuel who\nuses such fuel in the operation of motor vehicles on the public highways of New\n\nYork State, or in the operation of pleasure or recreational motor boats on the\nwaterways of the State (including any waterways bordering on the\n\nState). (c) In addition to the tax\non motor fuel described in subdivision (b) of this section, a local excise tax\nof one cent per gallon is imposed on leaded motor fuel sold within or for sale\nwithin the City of New York. Leaded motor fuel for purposes of this subdivision\nis motor fuel which contains one-half gram or more of tetra ethyl lead, tetramethyl lead or any other lead alkyls per gallon. This tax is administered\nand collected in the same manner as the State Motor Fuel Tax imposed pursuant\nto article 12-A of the Tax Law. (d) See Article 2 of this Subchapter for diesel motor fuel.
