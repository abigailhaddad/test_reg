Tit. 2 § 154.6 - Service credit and payment of contributions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each volunteer fire company or volunteer\nfire department for which a State-administered defined contribution volunteer\nfirefighter service award program is in effect shall maintain at all times for\neach volunteer firefighter of the volunteer fire company or volunteer fire\ndepartment, whether or not such volunteer firefighter is a participant in the\n\nState-administered defined contribution volunteer firefighter service award\nprogram, a record of the activities performed and points granted toward a year\nof firefighting service. The administrator may prescribe the form and manner of\ncompiling and maintaining such records. (b) On or before March 31st of each year, each volunteer fire company or volunteer fire department for which a\n\nState-administered defined contribution volunteer firefighter service award\nprogram is adopted shall prepare and submit to the governing board of the\nsponsor a list of all the volunteer firefighters of the volunteer fire company\nor volunteer fire department which identifies all those who have qualified for\ncredit for a year of firefighting service during the preceding calendar year. Such list shall be certified under oath by the president, secretary and chief\nor comparable officers of the volunteer fire company or volunteer fire\ndepartment and shall be accompanied by such membership records or records of\npoint accumulations as the governing board may require to substantiate the\naccuracy of the list. Such list shall also identify those volunteer\nfirefighters who have waived participation in the State-administered defined\ncontribution volunteer firefighter service award program as provided in\nsubdivision (f) of this section. (c) On or before May 1st of each year, the\ngoverning board of the sponsor shall review each such certified list and may\ndelete the name of any person who was not a volunteer firefighter during the\npreceding calendar year or disallow the service credit of any volunteer\nfirefighter who did not earn or otherwise receive 50 points during the\npreceding calendar year or whose point accumulation has not been adequately\ndocumented. Thereafter, the governing board shall approve each such certified\nlist of volunteer firefighters and each volunteer firefighter named thereon\nshall be credited with a year of firefighting service. Upon approval, the\ngoverning board shall cause a copy of each list to be returned to the\nappropriate volunteer fire company or volunteer fire department and each\nvolunteer fire company or volunteer fire department shall, immediately upon\nreceipt, post the list in a conspicuous place at its principal headquarters for\nat least 30 days and maintain a record of the date on which the list is posted; provided, however, that no personal identifying information shall be included\nin the list that is posted except the names of the firefighters credited with a\nyear of firefighting service. (d) Not later than 30 days after the approved list is posted by the volunteer fire\ncompany or volunteer fire department, any volunteer firefighter whose name does\nnot appear on the list as having qualified for credit for a year of\nfirefighting service may appeal to the governing board of the sponsor to have\nhis or her name added to the list. The appeal shall be in writing and mailed to\nthe clerk or secretary of the governing board of the sponsor. The governing\nboard shall investigate all appeals and upon finding that such a volunteer\nfirefighter has qualified for a year of firefighting service for the preceding\ncalendar year, shall order the volunteer firefighter's name to be added to the\napproved list. (e) On or before\n\nJuly 1st of each year, the governing board of the sponsor shall cause a\ncertified copy of the approved list to be filed with the\nadministrator. (f) Any volunteer\nfirefighter not wishing to participate in the State-administered defined\ncontribution volunteer firefighter service award program may waive\nparticipation by filing with the chief executive officer of the volunteer fire\ncompany or volunteer fire department, the chief executive officer of the\npolitical subdivision and the administrator a written notice of waiver of\nparticipation. Such waiver shall remain effective until withdrawn in the same\nmanner. During the period such a waiver remains effective, a volunteer\nfirefighter shall not earn service credit, nor be entitled to a distribution\nfrom the State-administered defined contribution volunteer firefighter service\naward program. (g) Notwithstanding\nthe provisions of subdivisions (b) through (e) of this section, if, as of the\neffective date of the conversion of the locally-administered defined\ncontribution volunteer firefighter service award program into a\n\nState-administered defined contribution volunteer firefighter service award\nprogram, the governing board of a sponsor has approved a certified list of\nvolunteer firefighters qualified for credit for a year of firefighting service\nrendered during the preceding calendar year in substantial compliance with the\nprocedures set forth in subdivisions (b) through (d) of this section, excepting\nthe dates set forth therein, the governing board shall comply with the filing\nrequirement of subdivision (e) of this section no later than 30 days after the\nchief executive officer of the sponsor files a completed and executed copy of\nthe adoption or transfer agreement with the administrator pursuant to section\n154.4\nof this Part. (h) (1)\n\nCommencing on November 15th of the year in which State administration begins, and each November 15th thereafter, the administrator shall estimate the amount\nthat each sponsor is required to contribute to a State-administered defined\ncontribution volunteer firefighter service award program for the current\ncalendar year, including any prior service contributions required to be paid in\nsuch year pursuant to section\n154.7\nof this Part, and any\nadditional amounts determined by the administrator to be necessary to fully\nfinance all existing obligations of such program. The administrator shall\nsubmit to the fiscal officer of each sponsor a statement of the amount so\npayable, plus any administrative costs payable by the sponsor. For good cause\nshown, the administrator may recalculate the contribution and issue a corrected\nstatement. If, as a result of the amount determined to be paid for any calendar\nyear, a sponsor overpaid its actual obligation for that year, the amount to be\ndetermined by the administrator for the next succeeding November 15th shall\nreflect the amount of the overpayment, plus interest, as a reduction in the\namount otherwise required to be paid by such sponsor. (2)\n\nWithin 60 days after the date of a\nstatement issued pursuant to paragraph (1) if this subdivision, the sponsor\nshall pay to the administrator the total amount due as shown on such\nstatement. (3)\n\nInterest shall\naccrue and be paid by the sponsor on all amounts due, but not received by the\nadministrator within 60 days after the date of the statement issued pursuant to\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision. The interest rate or rates used to calculate\nsuch interest shall be the actual investment return rate earned by the\nvolunteer firefighters' defined contribution service award program trust fund\nduring the calendar year (or years) in which such unpaid contributions were due\nto be paid. (4)\n\nThe administrator\nshall notify the Comptroller of any amounts remaining unpaid more than 90 days\nafter the date of the statement issued pursuant to subdivision (a) of this\nsection. (5)\n\nIn the event that a\nsponsor does not submit to the administrator an approved list in accordance\nwith subdivision (e) or (g) of this section, the administrator shall bill the\nsponsor for the contribution due for the calendar year in which the list should\nhave been submitted in an amount calculated by the administrator equal to the\nestimated contribution due during such year. Such estimated contribution shall\nbe calculated by the administrator as if all volunteer firefighters named on\nthe latest year's approved list received by the administrator continued to be\nvolunteer firefighters and all such persons earned a year of service credit\nduring the calendar year for which the list should have been prepared in\naccordance with subdivision (e) or (g) of this section. Payment of such\nestimated contribution shall be made in accordance with paragraphs (1) through\n(3) of this subdivision as if the administrator's estimate was based upon the\nactual approved lists prepared in accordance with subdivisions (a) through (e)\nof this section. Upon receipt by the administrator of the actual approved list\nprepared in accordance with subdivisions (a) through (e) of this section, the\nadministrator shall recompute the contributions due for such calendar year. In\nthe event that additional contributions are owed by the sponsor (including any\nadditional administration costs), the administrator shall bill the sponsor for\nsuch additional amounts. Interest shall be paid by the sponsor on all\nadditional amounts owed and shall accrue from the due date of the payment of\nthe estimated contribution billed to the sponsor by the administrator with such\ninterest calculated in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subdivision. Any\nexcess of the estimated contributions over the actual contributions shall be\ntreated as an overpayment by the sponsor in the manner provided in subdivision\n(a) of this section. The amount of such overpayment shall be reduced by any\nrelated additional administration costs charged by the administrator. The\nassessment of any extra additional administration charges payable by the\nsponsor to the administrator because of the failure to comply with subdivisions\n(a) through (e) of this section shall be in accordance with the contract\nbetween the Comptroller and the administrator. (i) (i) (a) Forfeitures shall be used to reduce\ncontributions for other service award participants. (b) In the event that two years have elapsed\nsince an inactive volunteer firefighter participant or a participant's\ndesignated beneficiary becomes eligible to apply for a service award and the\nadministrator does not receive an application for distribution, the\nadministrator, the sponsor and the volunteer fire company or volunteer fire\ndepartment in which the participant was a member shall attempt to notify the\nperson or persons to whom the service award would be paid. In the event that\nthe administrator, in his or her sole discretion, determines that a reasonable\nattempt has been made to contact such person or persons without success, the\nservice award payable shall then be considered as forfeited for the purpose of\ndetermining future contributions payable by the sponsor. (c) A participant who ceases to be a\nvolunteer firefighter before he or she has earned a nonforfeitable right to a\nservice award shall forfeit his or her service credit and account balance upon\nreceipt by the administrator of notice from the sponsor and the appropriate\nvolunteer fire department or volunteer fire company that the individual has\nceased to be a volunteer firefighter. The provisions of this subdivision shall\nnot apply to a volunteer firefighter who is determined to be totally and\npermanently disabled in accordance with section\n154.8\n(d) of this\n\nPart. (d) In the event that a\nperson whose service credit and account balance were forfeited in accordance\nwith paragraph (3) of this subdivision resumes being a volunteer firefighter\nwithin the five-year period beginning immediately after the calendar year in\nwhich he or she ceased to be a volunteer firefighter, such person's forfeited\nservice credit shall be restored as of December 31st of the first calendar year\nfor which he or she again qualifies for a year of firefighting service credit\nand again becomes a participant in the State-administered defined contribution\nvolunteer firefighter service award program in which he or she formerly was a\nparticipant.
