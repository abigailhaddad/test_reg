  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 262.5 - Processing operations for vacuum packaged or modified atmosphere packaged smoked fish\n\nState Regulations\n\nUnless otherwise provided by a scheduled process, the\nfollowing additional requirements shall apply to vacuum packaged or modified\natmosphere packaged smoked fish. (a) Brining of fish for smoking shall be carried out so that the temperature of the\nbrine does not exceed 60 degrees Fahrenheit at the start of brining. If the\nbrining time exceeds 4 hours, the brining shall take place in a refrigerated\narea of 38 degrees Fahrenheit or lower. For dry salting, the fish shall be\nreturned to a refrigerated area of 38 degrees Fahrenheit or lower immediately\nafter the salting step. (b) Brining\ntanks shall be cleaned and sanitized prior to use. Different species of fish\nshall not be mixed in the same tank, and brines shall not be reused unless\nthere is an adequate process available to return the brine to an acceptable\nmicrobiological level. (c) Fish to\nbe smoked shall be arranged without overcrowding or touching each other within\nthe smokehouse oven or chamber to allow for uniform smoke absorption, heat\nexposure, and dehydration. (d) Liquid smoke, generated smoke, or a combination of liquid smoke and generated\nsmoke shall be applied to all surfaces of fish to be smoked. Liquid smoke may\nbe applied to the product prior to, at the commencement of or during the\nprocess while generated smoke shall be applied to the fish during the first\nhalf of the process and longer if necessary. If a combination of liquid smoke\nand generated smoke is used, the procedures for liquid smoke shall be followed\nand the generated smoke may be applied at any stage of the process. (e) Vacuum packaged or modified atmosphere\npackaged hot process smoked fish shall be produced by a controlled process that\nutilizes a monitoring system such as calibrated probes or dial thermometers to\nassure that all products reach the required temperature. The temperature\nreadings shall be obtained by inserting an accurate temperature indicating\ndevice into the thickest flesh portion of three or more of the largest fish in\nthe smokehouse compartment. The coldest reading thus obtained shall be recorded\nin a fish smoking record as being the internal temperature of fish being\nsmoked. The internal temperature of fish being smoked shall be obtained and\nrecorded with the time taken at least three times during the operation of\nheating each load or batch of fish to assure that the required heat treatment\nhas been accomplished. Each batch of smoked fish shall be identified as to the\nspecific oven load, product temperature obtained, and date processed. The\ntemperature monitoring system shall be accurate to within 2 degrees\n\nFahrenheit. (f) Vacuum packaged or\nmodified atmosphere packaged hot process smoked fish shall be produced by a\ncontrolled process whereby each fish or fish portion shall be heated to an\ninternal temperature of 145 degrees Fahrenheit or higher and maintained at 145\ndegrees Fahrenheit or higher for 30 minutes or longer. The smoked fish shall be\nbrined to contain at least 3.5 percent water phase salt in the loin muscle of\nthe finished product, except that vacuum packaged or modified atmosphere\npackaged hot process smoked fish which contain 100-200 parts per million sodium\nnitrite shall contain at least 3.0 percent water phase salt in the loin muscle\nof the finished product when processed in this fashion. Vacuum packaged or\nmodified atmosphere packaged seafood processed in this fashion shall be brined\nto contain at least 3.5 percent water phase salt in the flesh portion of the\nproduct. (g) Vacuum packaged or\nmodified atmosphere packaged cold process smoked fish shall be produced by one\nof the following processes: (1)\n\nVacuum\npackaged or modified atmosphere packaged cold process smoked fish shall be\nproduced by a controlled process that utilizes a temperature monitoring system\npositioned within the smoking chamber and results in a temperature that shall\nnot exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit during the drying and smoking period, which\nperiod shall not exceed 20 hours. The smoked fish shall be brined to contain at\nleast 3.5 percent water phase salt in the loin muscle of the finished product\nexcept that vacuum packaged or modified atmosphere packaged cold process smoked\nfish which contain 100-200 parts per million sodium nitrite shall contain at\nleast 3.0 percent water phase salt in the loin muscle of the finished product\nwhen processed in this fashion; or\n(2)\n\nVacuum packaged or modified atmosphere\npackaged cold process smoked fish shall be produced by a controlled process\nthat utilizes a temperature monitoring system positioned within the smoking\nchamber and results in a temperature that does not exceed 50 degrees Fahrenheit\nduring the drying and smoking period, which period shall not exceed 24 hours. The smoked fish shall be brined to contain at least 3.5 percent water phase\nsalt in the loin muscle of the finished product except that vacuum packaged or\nmodified atmosphere packaged cold process smoked fish which contain 100-200\nparts per million sodium nitrite shall contain at least 3.0 percent water phase\nsalt in the loin muscle of the finished product when processed in this fashion; or\n(3)\n\nVacuum packaged or modified\natmosphere packaged cold process smoked sablefish shall be produced by a\ncontrolled process that utilizes a temperature monitoring system positioned\nwithin the smoking chamber and results in a temperature that shall not exceed\n120 degrees Fahrenheit during the drying and smoking period, which period shall\nnot exceed 6 hours. The smoked fish shall be brined to contain at least 3.5\npercent water phase salt in the loin muscle of the finished product except that\nvacuum packaged or modified atmosphere packaged cold process smoked sablefish\nwhich contain 100-200 parts per million sodium nitrite shall contain at least\n3.0 percent water phase salt in the loin muscle of the finished product when\nprocessed in this fashion. (h) Vacuum packaged or modified atmosphere\npackaged smoked fish shall be immediately cooled after processing to 50 degrees\n\nFahrenheit or below within 5 hours and further cooled to a temperature of 38\ndegrees Fahrenheit or below within 12 hours after processing.
