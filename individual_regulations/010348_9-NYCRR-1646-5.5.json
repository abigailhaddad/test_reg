Tit. 9 §§ 1646-5.5 - Contract retentions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Standard provisions of most construction contracts provide that a stipulated\npercentage, generally 10 percent of each partial payment due to be made under\nthe contract shall be retained by the local agency until the final completion\nand acceptance of all the work covered by the contract. The contract may, however, also provide that after a stipulated percentage, generally 50 percent\nof the work has been completed, the local agency may, with the prior written\napproval of the division, make partial payments in full for work which may\nstill remain to be done, without retaining any portion thereof. The State's\nconstruction adviser is not authorized to approve reductions in retaining\npercentages. (b) Amounts retained\nby a local agency in accordance with the terms of a contract must be held\nintact by it until the final payment (see §1641-5.7) is made under the\ncontract, unless the contract, with the prior written approval of the\ncommissioner, has been amended to provide for the making of payments out of\nretained amounts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1646-5.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
