  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 537.2 - Notice of sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of business assets\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. A\nnotice of a sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of business assets from a\npurchaser must be in substantial compliance with section\n1141 (c)\nof the Tax Law in\norder for the 90-day period (for the giving of notice by the Division of\n\nTaxation of the total amount of the taxes due) to commence. The Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance, in its sole discretion, may waive any defect in the\nservice, timeliness or contents of a notice of sale, transfer or\nassignment. (b) Service. (1)\n\nSuch notice of a sale, transfer or\nassignment in bulk shall be given by the purchaser, transferee or assignee by: (i) personal service (hand delivery), upon\npersons authorized by the Department of Taxation and Finance to accept such\nservice, at the Bulk Sales Unit, Central Office Audit Bureau, Audit Division, Department of Taxation and Finance, State Campus, Albany, NY; or\n(ii)\n\nUnited States registered mail to the\n\nBulk Sales Unit, Central Office Audit Bureau, Audit Division, Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance, State Campus, Albany, NY 12227; or\n(iii)\n\nUnited States certified mail--return\nreceipt requested, to the Bulk Sales Unit, Central Office Audit Bureau, Audit\n\nDivision, Department of Taxation and Finance, State Campus, Albany, N.Y. 12227; provided that the envelope or other wrapper containing the notice is delivered\nto an employee of the United States Postal Service who postmarks the sender's\nreceipt for such envelope or wrapper. (2)\n\nIf service of the notice does not comply\nwith the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, service shall be\ndeemed defective, and the notice of no force and effect, unless and until such\nnotice is actually received by the Bulk Sales Unit, Central Office Audit\n\nBureau, Audit Division, State Campus, Albany, NY 12227. The burden of showing\nthat such notice was actually received is on the purchaser. The fact that the\nnotice was actually mailed or delivered to a post office is not sufficient to\novercome the burden, nor may the purchaser rely on the presumption of\nregularity of the mail service. (c) Timeliness. (1)\n\nIf by personal service, such service must\nbe made at least 10 days prior to the taking of possession of or payment for\nsuch sale, transfer or assignment, whichever comes first. Example 1:A person purchasing business assets in bulk will\ntake possession of the assets and pay for the same on April 30, 1982. On April\n20, 1982 he serves the notice of sale by having such notice hand-delivered to\nan employee of the Department of Taxation and Finance who has been authorized\nby the department to accept such service. Since the notice was personally\nserved 10 days before the taking of possession and making payment, the notice\nis timely. (2)\n\nIf mailed by\n\nUnited States registered mail or United States certified mail--return receipt\nrequested, with a sender's receipt postmarked by an employee of the United\n\nStates Postal Service, the notice must be mailed at least 10 days prior to the\ntaking of such possession or payment, whichever comes first. Example 2:A person purchasing business assets in bulk will\ntake possession of the assets and pay for the same on April 30, 1982. He mails\nthe notice of sale by certified mail--return receipt requested, the sender's\nreceipt for which is postmarked on April 15, 1982. Because of delay in the\nmails, such notice is not received by the Bulk Sales Unit, Central Office Audit\n\nBureau, Audit Division, until April 23, 1982. Since the notice is mailed by\ncertified mail--return receipt requested, and the sender's receipt is\npostmarked by an employee of the United States Postal Service, the date of\nmailing and not the date of receipt governs. Accordingly, the notice is\ntimely. (3)\n\nIf mailed by\nordinary mail, certified mail--return receipt requested, without a postmarked\nsender's receipt, or certified mail with no return receipt requested, the\nnotice must actually be received by the Bulk Sales Unit, Central Office Audit\n\nBureau, Audit Division, Department of Taxation and Finance, State Campus, Albany, NY 12227 at least 10 days prior to the taking of possession or payment, whichever comes first. Example 3:Assume the facts in example 2, except that a\nreturn receipt is not requested or that the sender's receipt is not postmarked\nby an employee of the United States Postal Service. Therefore, the date of\nreceipt governs the timeliness of the mailing. Since the notice is not received\nwithin 10 days before the taking of possession and making payment, the notice\nis untimely. (4)\n\nThe\npayment by the prospective purchaser to the seller of an amount which is\nnominal in relation to the selling price in order to bind the transaction is\nnot deemed party payment for the purposes of this subdivision. However, if\npayment is made pursuant to a legally binding contract, such deposit\nconstitutes part payment. Example 4:A business places an advertisement in the\nnewspaper offering the sale of its business assets at an asking price of\n$250,000. In response to the advertisement a prospective purchaser signs a\nbinder with the seller's agent and deposits $250 with the agent to bind the\ntransaction. The details, including the exact items to be sold, are to be set\nforth in a contract to be subsequently entered into between the parties. The\ndeposit of $250 does not constitute part payment for the sale. (5)\n\nWhen the 10th day prescribed\nfalls on a Saturday, Sunday or day which is a legal holiday in the State of New\n\nYork, the notice will be considered timely if it is given on the next\nsucceeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday. Example 5:A person purchasing business assets in bulk will\ntake possession of the assets on February 23, 1982. The 10th day before that\ndate, February 13th, falls on Saturday. The next day is Sunday, and the next\nday is a legal holiday in New York State (Washington's birthday). The purchaser\nmails the notice by registered mail on Tuesday, February 16, 1982. The notice\nis timely. Example 6:Assume the same facts in example 5, except that\nthe purchaser makes personal service on Tuesday, February 16, 1982. The notice\nis timely. Example 7:Assume the facts in example 5, except that the\npurchaser mails the notice by ordinary mail and the notice is actually received\non Tuesday, February 16, 1982. The notice is timely. (6)\n\nEvery notice received more than 10 days\nprior to either the scheduled date of sale required to be set forth in the\nnotice pursuant to subparagraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section, or the actual date\nof sale shall be deemed to have been received on the 10th day prior to the\nlater of: (i) such scheduled date of sale; or\n(ii)\nthe actual date of sale\n(i.e., the earlier of the date of taking possession of or the date of payment\nfor the business assets). Example 8:The purchaser of a business files a notice of\nsale with the department on February 9, 1990 which indicates the scheduled date\nof sale as June 18, 1990. The notice of sale, although received by the\ndepartment on February 9, 1990 is deemed to have been received on June 8, 1990, 10 days prior to the date of sale indicated by the purchaser in the notice of\nsale. (d) Contents. (1)\n\nSuch notice is required to set forth: (i) the names and mailing addresses of the\npurchaser, seller and escrow agent, if any; (ii)\nthe purchaser's certificate of authority\nidentification number, if any, name and each business location; (iii)\nthe seller's certificate of authority\nidentification number, name, trade or business, trade or business name and each\nbusiness location (whether or not all such locations are the subject of the\nbulk sale); (iv)\nthe scheduled date\nof sale; (v) the total sales price\nof business or property; (vi)\nthe\nbreakdown of the total sales price into the sales price paid for ( a) goodwill, (b) accounts receivable, (c) notes receivable, (d) mortgages, (e) securities, (\nf) furniture and fixtures, (g) motor vehicles, ( h) manufacturing equipment, (i) other equipment, ( j) inventory, and (k) real property. If the sales price\nis indivisible and not applicable to any of the items, the total fair market\nvalue of the items in each category should be set forth; (vii)\nthe amount of escrow funds; (viii)\nthe location and type of business or\nproperty transferred; and\n(ix)\nthe\nterms and conditions of the sale, such as method of payment, schedule of\npayment or inventory of items. (2)\nA preprinted notice of sale, transfer or\nassignment in bulk of business assets is available upon request from the\n\nTaxpayer Assistance Bureau, Department of Taxation and Finance, State Campus, Albany, NY 12227, or from the Taxpayer Assistance Bureau at any district office\nof the Department of Taxation and Finance. (e) Revised notices. (1)\nA purchaser who has previously filed a\nnotice of sale with the Department of Taxation and Finance must file a revised\nnotice with the department if any of the information which was required to be\nincluded in the original notice, in accordance with subdivision (d) of this\nsection, changes, was incorrect or was not available at the time the original\nnotice was filed. (2)\n\nEvery revised\nnotice of sale filed with the department is subject to all the rules set forth\nin this section as to service, timeliness and contents. (3)\n\nWhere any item of information required to\nbe contained in a revised notice of sale differs from the information contained\nin a prior notice of sale, the information contained in the revised notice will\nprevail. Where an item of information required to be contained in a revised\nnotice is omitted but was included in a prior notice, the information will be\nconsidered to be unchanged. The date of receipt or, if applicable, the deemed\ndate of receipt, of the revised notice will determine the dates by which the\ndepartment must fulfill its obligations under subdivisions (a) and (c) of\nsection\n537.6\nof this Part. Example 9:Assume the same facts as in Example 8 of this\nsection, except that on April 4, 1990 the purchaser files a revised notice of\nsale with the department stating that the sale will now take place on May 11, 1990. The department will now deem the date of receipt of the notice to be May\n1, 1990, the tenth day prior to the new scheduled date of sale. Example 10:Assume the same facts as in Example 8 of this\nsection except that on April 4, 1990 the purchaser files a revised notice of\nsale stating that the sale actually took place on March 12, 1990. The date of\nreceipt of the revised notice, April 4, 1990, will be used by the department in\ndetermining the dates by which it must fulfill its obligations under\nsubdivisions (a) and (c) of section\n537.6\nof this Part.
