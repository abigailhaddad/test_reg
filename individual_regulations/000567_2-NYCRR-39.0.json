  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 39.0 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nGeneral Municipal Law, section 109-b authorizes political\nsubdivisions to enter into installment purchase contracts to finance capital\nimprovements and to cause or permit certificates of participation to be issued\nin connection therewith. Subparagraph (d) of subdivision (3) of that statute\nrequires the State Comptroller to adopt rules \"governing the procedure which\nshall be adhered to when entering into installment purchase contracts or\nauthorizing the execution and delivery of certificates of participation....\"\nThis provision further provides that a political subdivision shall not conduct\nthe private sale of certificates of participation without prior approval of the\n\nState Comptroller \"except as provided in such rules which shall set forth the\ncircumstances under which such approval shall not be required.\" This Part is\nbeing promulgated in accordance with the requirements of General Municipal Law, section 109-b(3)(d). The primary purposes of these rules are to: (a) cause a political subdivision to\ncritically evaluate the financing alternatives available to it under section\n109-b\nof the General Municipal Law and the Local Finance Law; (b) ensure that a political subdivision, when\nprocuring the capital improvements to be financed, complies with the\ncompetitive bidding requirements of article 5-a of the General Municipal Law or\nany other general, special or local law or, if such competitive bidding\nrequirements are not applicable, the policies required to be adopted pursuant\nto General Municipal Law, section 104-b; and\n(c) require a political subdivision to seek\ncompetition for financing unless the political subdivision determines that it\nis in its best interests to conduct a private sale of certificates of\nparticipation.
