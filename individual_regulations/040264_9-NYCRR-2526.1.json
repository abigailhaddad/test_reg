In no event shall such treble\ndamage penalty be assessed against an owner based solely upon the owner's\nfailure to file any timely or proper rent registration statement. If the owner\nestablishes by a preponderance of the evidence that the overcharge was not\nwillful, the DHCR shall establish the penalty as the amount of the overcharge\nplus interest, which interest shall accrue from the date of the first\novercharge on or after the base date, at the rate of interest payable on a\njudgment pursuant to section\n5004\nof the Civil Practice Law and Rules, and the order shall direct such a payment to be made to the tenant.

If no such rent credit has been taken, the\norder of the DHCR awarding penalties may be entered, filed and enforced by a\ntenant in the same manner as a judgment of the Supreme Court, on a form\nprescribed by the DHCR, provided that the amount of the penalty exceeds $1,000\nor the tenant is no longer in possession. Neither of these remedies is\navailable until the expiration of the period in which the owner may institute a\nproceeding pursuant to Part 2530 of this Title. (f) Responsibility for overcharges. (1)\n\nFor overcharges collected prior to April\n1, 1984, an owner will be held responsible only for his or her portion of the\novercharges, in the absence of collusion or any relationship between such owner\nand any prior owners. (2)\n(i) For overcharge complaints filed or\novercharges collected on or after April 1, 1984, a current owner shall be\nresponsible for all overcharge penalties, including penalties based upon\novercharges collected by any prior owner. However, in the absence of collusion\nor any relationship between such owner and any prior owner, where no records\nsufficient to establish the legal regulated rent were provided at a judicial\nsale, or such other sale effected in connection with, or to resolve, in whole\nor in part, a bankruptcy proceeding, mortgage foreclosure action or other\njudicial proceeding, an owner who purchases upon or subsequent to such sale\nshall not be liable for overcharges collected by any owner prior to such sale, and treble damages upon overcharges that he or she collects which result from\novercharges collected by any owner prior to such sale. An owner who did not\npurchase at such sale, but who purchased subsequent to such sale, shall also\nnot be liable for overcharges collected by any prior owner subsequent to such\nsale to the extent that such overcharges are the result of overcharges\ncollected prior to such sale. (ii)\n\nCourt-appointed receivers. A receiver who is appointed by a court of competent\njurisdiction to receive rent for the use or occupation of a housing\naccommodation shall not, in the absence of collusion or any relationship\nbetween such receiver and any owner or other receiver, be liable for\novercharges collected by any owner or other receiver, and treble damages upon\novercharges that he or she collects which result from overcharges collected by\nany owner or other receiver, where records sufficient to establish the legal\nregulated rent have not been made available to such receiver. Penalties\npursuant to this paragraph shall be subject to the time limitations set forth\nin paragraph (a)(2) of this section. (3)\n\nThis subdivision shall not be construed\nto entitle a tenant to more than one refund for the same overcharge. (g) Where the rent charged on the\nbase date cannot be determined, a full rental history from the base date is not\nprovided, or the base date rent is the product of a fraudulent scheme to\nderegulate the apartment or a rental practice proscribed under section\n2525.3\n(c) and (d)\nof this Title has been committed, the rent shall be established at the lowest\nof the following amounts.

However, in the absence of collusion or any relationship\nbetween an owner and any prior owner, where such owner purchases the housing\naccommodations upon a judicial sale, or such other sale effected in connection\nwith, or to resolve, in whole or in part, a bankruptcy proceeding, mortgage\nforeclosure action or other judicial proceeding, and no records sufficient to\nestablish the legal regulated rent were made available to such purchaser, such\norders shall establish the legal regulated rent on the date of the inception of\nthe complaining tenant's tenancy, or the date four years prior to the date of\nthe filing of an overcharge complaint pursuant to this section, whichever is\nmost recent, based on either: (1)\ndocumented rents for comparable housing accommodations, whether or not subject\nto regulation pursuant to this Part, submitted by the owner, subject to\nrebuttal by the tenant; or\n(2)\nif\nthe documentation set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision is not\navailable or is inappropriate, data compiled by the DHCR, using sampling\nmethods determined by the DHCR, for regulated housing accommodations; or\n(3)\nin the event that the\ninformation described in both paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision is not\navailable, the complaining tenant's rent reduced by the most recent guidelines\nadjustment. This subdivision shall also apply where the owner\npurchases the housing accommodations subsequent to such judicial or other\nsale. (h) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph\n(a)(2) of this section, the provisions of this section shall not apply to a\nproceeding pursuant to section\n2522.3\nof this Title.
