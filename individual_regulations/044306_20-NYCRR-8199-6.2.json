  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8199-6.2 - Transition assessments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where\nthere is a reduction in assessments on State lands as defined in section\n545\nof the Real Property Tax Law, a\ntransition assessment shall be computed as follows: (1)\n\nThe prior roll's approved assessments for\nparcels on the current roll shall be added together by taxing unit. That sum\nshall be multiplied by the adjustment index for the prior roll, and by the\nchange in level of assessment for the current roll where such change is two\npercent or more. (2)\n\nThe prior\nroll's assessments for parcels acquired subsequent to the prior roll shall be\nadded together by taxing unit. That sum shall be multiplied by the change in\nlevel of assessment for the current roll where such change is two percent or\nmore and that product shall be added to the amount computed in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision. (3)\n\nAny reduction\nin assessments from the prior to the current roll for parcels still on the\ncurrent roll shall be determined by subtracting, by taxing unit, the sum of the\ncurrent roll's approved assessment from the sum of the prior roll's assessments\nadjusted as described in paragraph (2) of this subdivision (the difference\ncannot be less than zero). (4)\n\nWhere there was no transition assessment for a taxing unit in the prior year, the transition assessment is equal to the reduction in assessments, if any, determined in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nWhere there was a transition assessment\nfor a taxing unit in the prior year: (i) The\nprior roll's transition assessment shall be adjusted to the current roll by\nfirst multiplying by the adjustment index, and then by the change in level of\nassessment on the current roll where it is two percent or more. (ii)\n\nThe total taxable assessed value for the\ntaxing unit on the prior roll shall be multiplied by the change in level of\nassessment for the current roll where it is two percent or more. (iii)\n\nThis product shall be multiplied by two\npercent. (iv)\n\nThis amount shall be\nsubtracted from the adjusted prior year's transition assessment determined in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph (the difference cannot be less than\nzero). (v) The amounts obtained in\nparagraph (3) and subparagraph (iv) shall be added. (6)\n\nThe transition assessment is equal to the\namount computed in paragraph (4) or (5) of this subdivision, rounded to the\nnearest $10, except that a transition assessment is not established where it\nwould be less than $50. (b) Where the provisions of section\n545\nof the Real Property Tax Law require a\ntransition assessment due to acquisition by the State, a transition assessment\nshall be computed as follows: (1)\n\nIf no\ntransition assessment was established for the prior roll: (i) Where it appears that a transition\nassessment is required, or upon receipt of a written request from the\nappropriate taxing unit, the percentage of real property acquired on the roll\npreceding the prior roll shall be computed by taxing unit by dividing the total\ntaxable assessed value of the property acquired by the total taxable assessed\nvalue of the taxing unit. The taxing unit shall be eligible for a transition\nassessment if this percentage is two percent or more. (ii)\n\nFor each taxing unit, the transition\nassessment is equal to the total taxable assessed value on the prior roll of\nthe property acquired multiplied by the change in level of assessment for the\ncurrent roll where it is two percent or more. (2)\n\nIf a transition assessment was\nestablished for a taxing unit for the prior roll: (i) The prior roll's transition assessment\nshall be adjusted to the current roll by multiplying it by the adjustment index\nand the change in level of assessment on the current roll where it is two\npercent or more. (ii)\n\nThe total\ntaxable assessed value on the prior roll of any acquisitions of real property\nby the State which become exempt upon the current roll as provided in section\n545\nof the Real Property Tax Law shall be\nadjusted by multiplying this amount by the change in level of assessment on the\ncurrent roll where it is two percent or more. (iii)\n\nThe amounts obtained from subparagraphs\n(i) and (ii) of this paragraph shall be added. (iv)\n\nThe total taxable assessed value for the\ntaxing unit on the prior roll shall be multiplied by the change in level of\nassessment for the current roll where it is two percent or more. (v) This value shall be multiplied by two\npercent. (vi)\n\nThis amount shall be\nsubtracted from the amount determined in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. Where the result is negative, the result is set equal to zero. (3)\n\nThe transition assessment is\nequal to the amount computed in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision, rounded to the nearest $10, except that a transition assessment is not\nestablished where it would be less than $50.
