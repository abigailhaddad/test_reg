  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 454.2 - Concepts for functional reporting\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In order to comply with the reporting requirements of the New York State\n\nDepartment of Health, residental health care facilities must adhere to the\nfollowing basic concepts. (1)\n\nResidential\nhealth care facilities must follow the uniform accounting policies and\npractices as specified in Part 452 of this Article. Items such as methods of\ncapitalization and depreciation of assets and direct charging of maintenance\nrepairs, and payroll-related benefits to using centers are examples of\nimportant policies which must be adhered to for the annual uniform financial\nreport. (2)\n\nThe principles and\nconcepts utilized in the preparation of the annual uniform financial report\nwill be based upon a portrayal of the activities on a functional basis\nregardless of third-party reimbursement practices. (3)\n\nAnother concept affecting the preparation\nof the annual uniform financial report is the requirement that costs will be\nmeasured at a level where uniformity can be obtained and a standard statistical\nmeasurement applied. For purposes of reporting, it was determined that standard\nunits of measure would not be applied to certain nonrevenue or general support\nservices; however, their total cost would be identifiable. The application of\nstandard units of measure for some support services and ancillary revenue\ncenters and all program centers would occur at the direct cost level. Standard\nunits of measure may also be applied to support services, ancillary revenue and\nprogram service centers after cost allocation. (4)\n\nUniform financial reporting for revenue\nand expense categories is divided into three categories, as follows: (i) nonrevenue support services\ncenters--includes those reporting centers which do not normally produce patient\nservice revenue and which tend to support the activities and services provided\nby the patient care services or special education, research or auxiliary\nprograms. Reporting centers representing functions not necessarily associated\nwith services would also be included in this category, such as insurance, etc; (ii)\nancillary service\ncenters--includes those reporting centers which provide diagnostic and\ntreatment services for inpatient and outpatient care; and\n(iii)\nprogram and auxiliary service\ncenters--includes those patient care, education, research and auxiliary\nprograms for which the residential health care facility is ultimately organized\nto provide. All effort within the facility is ultimately related to these final\nprogram centers. (b) Conversion from responsibility to\nfunctional reporting. (1)\nA fundamental aspect\nof the uniform financial reporting program is the portrayal of revenue and\nexpenses on a functional basis rather than following the organizational pattern\nof the specific residential health care facility. (2)\n\nThe need for uniform functional reporting\npractices occurs from the fact that facilities will identify costs and revenue\naccording to responsibility centers; that is, the reporting of costs according\nto the operating units such as departments. Because of the significant\nvariation of the size and scope of residential health care facilities, there\nmay be variation in the assignment of costs within each chart of accounts. Therefore, for uniform functional reporting of revenue and expenses, there may\nbe a need for reclassifications to convert costs from the responsibility\nreporting format to a functional reporting format. Functional reporting may be\ndefined as the reporting of costs according to the type of\nactivities. (3)\n\nCertain facilites\nwill be required to reclassify certain revenue and expenses to meet the\nspecifications for uniform reporting. Without this conversion from\nresponsibility to functional reporting, residential health care facilities\nwould not be reporting costs in a uniform manner, thus defeating the purposes\nof the uniform financial reporting requirements within the State. (4)\n\nTo achieve uniform functional reporting, all facilities will be required to reclassify revenue, expenses and statistics\naccording to the definition of the functional centers discussed in Part 455 of\nthis Article. (i) Reclassifications, as\ndiscussed in this Part are of two types: (a) To obtain the required level of reporting. This type of reclassification may be\nnecessary to reach the required level of reporting because the facility has\ncombined several departments. For instance, smaller facilities may be combining\nthe costs of housekeeping and maintenance in one reporting center. In such\ncases, it is necessary to reclassify the total direct costs into the reporting\ncenters relating to these two types of services. (b) To correct accumulation of costs. This\ntype of reclassification would be necessary when the expense associated with a\nparticular function is recorded in a reporting center different from the\nfunctional description specified in this section. For instance, a\nreclassification would be required if the Patient Food Services Department\nrecorded the costs associated with hand-feeding of patients, because these\ncosts should have been recorded in the nursing reporting center relating to\nthat patient program. (ii)\n\nThese reclassifications may be computed\non any one of the following bases: (a) analysis of direct expense, including time and cost studies; (b) ratio of total charges to charges of a\nspecific cost center; or\n(c) ratio\nof total units of service to units of service reclassified in a specific\nreporting center. (iii)\n(iii)\n(a) Reclassifications must be made for significant amounts of misplaced costs. Significant is defined, for the purposes of this section, as an amount in\nexcess of: (1)\none full-time equivalent\nemployee within the functional center transferred to or from for salary costs; or\n(2)\n10 percent of the direct\ncosts or $1,000, whichever is greater, of the functional center transferred to\nor from, for other than salary costs. (b) For the purposes of this Part, an\nestimate may be utilized to determine the limination for salary costs. This\nestimate should be based on an approximation of one employee's total paid\nworking hours during the year; e.g., 2,000 hours representing one full-time\nemployee. (c) Pursuant to the above\ncriteria, the determination of the necessity for reclassification of salary\ncosts may be made based on time studies. A time study must be made of employees\nwho are performing activities related to more than one function. Time studies\nwould be performed for such employees for a two-week period per quarter, for\nall four quarters in a year. The time study would result in a percentage of\nemployees' hours worked, by function, to total hours worked. These percentages\nwould, for each quarter, be applied to total hours paid for the same employees\nto arrive at hours paid by function. The results would be totaled for all four\nquarters and then compared to the estimate of one full-time equivalent of 2,000\nhours to determine whether or not a reclassification is required. (d) When reclassifying full-time equivalent\nemployees between cost centers, non-work hours, i.e., vacation, sick pay, etc., will also be reclassified. (e) The\ntests of significance indicated above do not apply to the areas described in\nsection 453.4 of this Article. These allocations must be classified as\ndescribed in that section. Also, in determining the segregation of costs\nbetween the Cafeteria and Patient Food Service Reporting Centers, where joint\nkitchen facilities are used, the criteria described in those functional\nreporting centers is to be utilized.
