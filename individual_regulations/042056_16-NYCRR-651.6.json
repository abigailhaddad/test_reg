Tit. 16 § 651.6 - Microform, tape and computer output certification\n\nState Regulations\n(a) As the initial recording media: (1)\n\nExcept as provided for in paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision each microform record series shall contain, at the\nbeginning, a microform introduction stating the title of the record series, the\ndate prepared, the name of the official responsible for validating the data\ncontained therein. Each microform record series shall be closed with a clear\nand standard microform notation indicating the completion of the series and the\ndate. (2)\n\nIf an official permanent\nrecord series is a computer output product ( i.e., output paper or microfilm, jacket microfiche or aperture cards), any certification that may otherwise be\nrequired under paragraph(1) of this subdivision is not required if: (i) the series is prepared in accordance with\nwritten standard procedures developed or accepted general business practices\nfollowed by the company that ensure the integrity of record series that are the\nproduct of computer output; and\n(ii)\nsuch procedures or practices include the\nname or title of the official responsible for validating or confirming the data\ncontained in the record series and confirming that a particular computer output\nrecord series was produced in accordance with the standard procedures or\npractices. (3)\n\nIf after\nvalidation, supplemental data and/or corrections (i.e., resulting from computer\nprogramming) are required, said microform may be produced separately or as a\npart of the series rerun, but shall be affixed to the original microform\ncertificate as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nEach tape record series shall be\nexternally labeled and shall include, as a basic part of the program, at the\nbeginning of that series an introduction stating the record series title, date\nprepared, the name of the official responsible for validating or confirming the\ndata contained therein and an index where appropriate. Each record series shall\nbe closed with a clear and standard notation indicating the completion of that\nseries and the date. (b) Conversion from other media: (1)\n\nEach\nmicroform record series shall include, as an integral part, a certificate(s)\nstating that the microform are direct and facsimile reproductions of the\noriginal records and that they have been made in accordance with prescribed\ninstructions. Such certificate(s) shall be executed by a person(s) having\npersonal knowledge of the facts covered thereby. (2)\n\nEach microform record series shall\ncommence and end with a statement as to the nature and arrangement of the\nrecords reproduced, and the date. Rolls of film shall not be cut, except to\nproduce jacketed microfiche. Supplemental or retaken film, whether of misplaced\nor omitted documents or of portions of microform found to be defective, shall\nbe attached to the beginning of the microform record series. However, if a\nretrieval system using such methods as, for example, image count indexing or\n\"blipping\" is used, the supplemental or retaken film may be attached at the end\nof the series, if provisions at the beginning of the series advise the viewer\nof the location of the problem frames and the location of the supplemental or\nretaken frames. If supplemental or retaken film of misplaced or omitted\ndocuments, or of portions of microform found to be defective, are attached to\nthe microform record series, the certificate described in paragraph (a)(1) of\nthis section shall cover the supplemental or retaken film and shall state the\nreasons for the attachment. (3)\n\nIf, in accordance with the provisions of section\n651.7\nof this Part, the telephone\nutility elects to convert records to the tape media, the same certification\nprovision specified in paragraph (a)(4) of this section must be provided in the\nconversion program.
