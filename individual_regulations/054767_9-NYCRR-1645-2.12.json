  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-2.12 - General ledger segregation of reserve fund investments\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor reasons of administrative facility, all reserve\nfund investments, like reserve fund cash, are pooled to the extent that all the\ninvestments are charged to the one account (account 1176, Reserve Fund\n\nInvestments) and are registered in the name of the reserve fund. Separate\naccountability of reserve fund investments by reserves, is prescribed and may\nbe accomplished by a general ledger analysis, using a columnar ledger sheet. See also sections 1645- 3.1 and 1647-5.1. A similar general ledger analysis is\nmaintained of reserve fund cash. In this manner, the assets of each reserve can\nbe accounted for, so that, at all times, each reserve may be reconciled with\nits assets. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1645-2.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
