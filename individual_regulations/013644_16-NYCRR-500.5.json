  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 500.5 - Tests of meters\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Tests to be\nmade on meters may be considered in two classes, viz.: routine tests as\nhereinbefore required and tests required upon complaint of consumers or for\nother special purposes. (b) The\nvolume of water passed must be sufficient to cause at least one revolution of\nthe pointer on the initial dial except for sensitivity test at \"minimum test\nflow\" rate when the said rate shall be maintained for at least five minutes\nduring which time the pointer on the initial dial shall show a steady uniform\nmovement. (c) Tests of meters over\ntwo inches in size may be made in place on the premises by means of an\naccurately calibrated test-meter of suitable size or by some other reliable\napparatus approved by the commission. (d) Displacement type. (1)\n\nAll routine tests of displacement type\nmeters shall be conducted by testing for accuracy of registration at not less\nthan two rates of flow within \"normal test flow limits,\" one rate to be\napproximately that at which the percentage of accuracy is a maximum and the\nother at approximately the high rate of flow, or in the case of large meters\ntested in place on premises, at as high a rate as practicable. (2)\n\nAll tests made upon complaint of\nconsumers or for other special purposes shall be conducted by testing for\naccuracy of registration at not less than three rates, namely, at the two rates\nstipulated above for routine tests and also at approximately the low rate of\nflow. (e) Current type. All routine and complaint tests of current meters shall be made within and as\nnear as practicable to the low and high rates given under \"normal test flow\nlimits\" and, if required, at intermediate rates. (f) Compound and fire-service types. The\naccuracy of compound and fire-service meters should be determined by making a\nsufficient number of tests at different rates of flow between the high and low\nrates given under \"normal test flow limits\" to permit the construction of a\nrepresentative accuracy curve; the tests should be of such scope that the rates\nof flow at the beginning and end of the \"change-over\" and the maximum error in\nregistration can readily be determined. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n500.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
