Where the Federal income tax return of an\nindividual for a taxable year, in which a change of resident status occurs, includes net income or net loss from the operation of a business or profession, a separate computation of the business net income or net loss must be made with\nrespect to each period for which a New York State personal income tax return is\nrequired under this Part. If it is not practicable to compute separate amounts\nof business net income or net loss attributable to the New York State personal\nincome tax returns, the amount reportable on the Federal income tax return for\nthe entire year may be allocated to the period prior to and the period\nsubsequent to the change of residence on the basis of the Federal gross income\nor gross receipts of the business or profession attributable to each period, provided that the results of such allocation are consistent with the business\nor professional activities actually carried on during the taxable year. The\namount computed in accordance with this subdivision is subject to the\nprovisions of section\n154.10\nof this\n\nPart regarding special accruals, to the extent such accruals relate to the\nconduct of the business or profession. (b) Gross profit (loss) and related business\nexpenses from trade or business of a trust.

The gross profit (loss) from a trade or\nbusiness and related business expenses reportable on the New York State\nfiduciary return for the remaining portion of its taxable year during which the\ntrust was a nonresident trust is determined, except for the provisions of\nsections\n154.10\nand\n154.11\nof this Part, as if its taxable year for Federal income tax purposes were\nlimited to the period of its nonresident status. However, the amounts of gross\nprofit (loss) from a trade or business and related business expenses reportable\non the New York State fiduciary return for the portion of the year during which\nthe trust was a nonresident trust must include only that portion of the amount\nof such items which is attributable to a trade or business carried on in New\n\nYork State by the trust.
