  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 2.15 - Water supply-item 8r\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe water supply shall meet the following\nrequirements: (a) Water for milkhouse\nand milking operation shall be from a supply properly located, protected and\noperated, and shall be easily accessible, adequate and of a safe, sanitary\nquality. (b) The water supply shall\ncontain an MPN (most probable number of coliform organisms) of less than 1.1\nper 100 ml by the multiple tube fermentation method, or less than 1.1 per 100\nml by the membrane filter technique, or absent (less than 1 per 100 ml) by the\nchromogenic substrate (MMO-MUG) presence-absence method. (c) No cross-connection shall exist between a\nsafe water supply and any unsafe or questionable water supply, or any other\nsource of pollution. (d) There\nshall be no submerged inlets through which a safe water supply may be\ncontaminated. (e) The well or other\nsource of water shall be located and constructed in such a manner that neither\nunderground nor surface contamination from any sewerage systems, privy or other\nsource of pollution can reach such water supply. All drilled wells constructed\nafter the effective date of this Part shall have casings extended above the\nsurface level of the surrounding ground. (f) New individual water supplies and water\nsupply systems which have been repaired or otherwise become contaminated shall\nbe thoroughly disinfected before being placed in use. The supply shall be made\nfree of the disinfectant by pumping to waste before any sample for\nbacteriological testing shall be collected. (g) Water supplies which are otherwise found\nsatisfactory but which are unable to meet the bacteriological standards set\nforth in this section shall be subjected to continuous disinfection by a method\nand with equipment acceptable to the commissioner. (h) All containers and tanks used in the\ntransportation of water shall be sealed and protected from possible\ncontamination. These containers and tanks shall be subjected to a thorough\ncleaning and a bacteriological treatment prior to filling with potable water to\nbe used at the dairy farm. To minimize the possibility of contamination of the\nwater during its transfer from the potable tanks to the elevated or groundwater\nstorage at the dairy farm, a suitable pump, hose and fittings shall be\nprovided. When the pump hose and fitting are not being used, the outlets shall\nbe capped and stored in a suitable dust-proof enclosure so as to prevent their\ncontamination. The storage tank at the dairy farm shall be constructed of\nimpervious material provided with a dustproof and rainproof cover, and also\nprovided with an approved-type vent and roof hatch. All new reservoirs or\nreservoirs which have been cleaned shall be disinfected prior to placing them\ninto service. (i) Samples for\nbacteriological examination shall be taken upon the initial approval of the\nphysical structure based upon the requirements of this Part and when any repair\nor alteration of the water supply system has been made, and at least every\nthree years; provided, that water supplies with buried well casing seals, installed prior to the adoption of this section, shall be tested at intervals\nno greater than six months apart. Whenever such samples indicate either the\npresence of bacteria of the coliform group, or whenever the well casing, pump\nor seal need replacing or repair, the well casing and seal shall be brought\nabove the ground surface and shall comply with all other applicable\nconstruction criteria of this section; provided, that when water is hauled to\nthe dairy farm, such water shall be sampled for bacteriological examination at\nthe point of use and submitted to a laboratory each month. Bacteriological\nexaminations shall be conducted in an officially designated\nlaboratory. (j) Current records of\nwater tests shall be retained on file at the dairy farm. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n2.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
