Trade\ndiscount does not include a rebate. (iv)\n\nDiscount for cash\nmeans\nany deduction from the list price of cigarettes which the manufacturer allows\nfor payment within a certain period of time.

Such costs shall\nbe effective on the dates prescribed by the department and may be used for\npurposes of complying with this Article with respect to such brands. (4)\n\"Illustration.\" This illustration is\nfundamental to this Article and will be referred to throughout in further\nexplanation of the cigarette marketing standards. For illustration purposes\nonly, the basic cost of cigarettes is assumed to be $86 per carton, computed as\nfollows: Invoice cost (per carton), less all trade\ndiscounts except discounts for cash\n$ 27.50\n\nNew York State cigarette tax\n43.50\n\nNew York City cigarette tax\n+ 15.00\n\nBasic cost of cigarettes\n$ 86.00\n(b) (1)\n\nWholesale dealer, for purposes of Article 2 of this\n\nSubchapter, means any person, other than an agent, who sells cigarettes in New\n\nYork State to retail dealers or to other persons for purposes of resale and who\nmaintains a separate warehousing facility for the purpose of receiving and\ndistributing cigarettes and conducting its wholesale business. If a wholesale\ndealer is also a retail dealer, such dealer must maintain separate premises for\nsuch retail business. A wholesale dealer shall not include a vending machine\noperator. The term wholesale dealer is also defined in article 20 of the Tax\n\nLaw with respect to the cigarette tax and the tobacco products tax (see\n\nArticles 1 and 3 of this Subchapter). Hereinafter, cigarette marketing\nstandards wholesale dealer\nor\nCMSA wholesale dealer\nshall denote wholesale dealers for purposes of the Cigarette Marketing\n\nStandards Act. (2)\n(i) A\nseparate warehousing\nfacility\nfor the purpose of receiving and distributing cigarettes and\nconducting wholesale business shall mean a warehouse, storehouse or other\ncommercial building, or a group of such buildings, wherein cigarettes are\nreceived, stored and distributed and the dealer's day-to-day wholesale business\nactivities are conducted. Such a warehousing facility must be separate and\ndistinct from any other person's facilities. A warehousing facility shall not\ninclude a mere enclosure within a larger facility, nor a means of\ntransportation (\ni.e., a truck or van). (ii)\n\nSeparate premises\nfor\nretail business shall mean any building or portion of a building where\ncigarettes are stored and sold or offered for sale to consumers and where the\nday-to-day retail business of the dealer is conducted. Such premises must be\nseparate from any space where the wholesale business activities, if any, of the\ndealer are performed. Hence, if the retail premises are part of a common\nbuilding where both wholesale and retail businesses are carried out, the retail\npremises must have a separate entrance/exit for use by consumers and such\nconsumers must be precluded from entering areas used for other than retail\npurposes. (3)\n\nEvery\nperson who qualifies as a CMSA wholesale dealer pursuant to this subdivision is\nalso a wholesale dealer for purposes of the cigarette tax and as such must\nprocure a license pursuant to section\n480\nof the Tax\n\nLaw (see Part 72 of this Title). (c) (1)\n\nChain store\nincludes certain: (i) persons who own or maintain 15 or more\nretail outlets; (ii)\nvending\nmachine operators; (iii)\ncooperative members; (iv)\nfranchisees; and\n(v) large volume\noutlet operators, as all such persons are described in this subdivision. No\nperson shall be considered to be a chain store, unless such person has been\nregistered with the Department of Taxation and Finance as provided for in\nsection\n489\nof the Tax Law (see Part 81 of this\n\nTitle). (2)\n15 or more\nretail outlets. Any person or persons who own or maintain 15 or more retail\noutlets through which cigarettes are sold at retail shall be considered to be a\nchain store, provided such retail outlets are located in New York State and\nhave a 100 percent common ownership. For purposes of this paragraph, a\n100 percent common ownership\nshall mean that, in addition to\nbeing owned by the same person or persons, if such retail outlets are owned by\nmore than one person, each person's proportionate ownership interest in any one\nretail outlet of the group must be the same as its proportionate ownership\ninterest in every other retail outlet of the group. Accordingly, should for\nexample, two persons each have a common ownership interest in 14 retail outlets\nof 50 percent of each outlet, but have ownership interests in a fifteenth\nretail outlet of 60 percent and 40 percent respectively, such persons would not\nbe considered to be a chain store. (3)\n\nVending machine operators. A vending\nmachine operator who sells cigarettes through vending machines at 15 or more\nseparate outlets which are located in New York State shall be considered to be\na chain store. A\nseparate outlet\nmeans a single marketing\nlocation. Generally, and unless a vending machine operator or the department\ncan establish otherwise, a building shall constitute a single marketing\nlocation. Thus, vending machines located in different sections of the same\nbuilding or on different floors of the same building will be deemed to be\nlocated at a single marketing location and, therefore, are considered located\nat one separate outlet. (See also, Part 73 of this Title for vending machine\nregistrations.)\n(4)\n(i) Cooperative members. Chain store includes cooperative members. A\ncooperative member\nmeans any member of a cooperative as defined in subdivision (c) of section\nthree of the Cooperative Corporation Law, that operates a distribution center\nfrom which members purchase general merchandise intended for resale and whose\nmembers sell cigarettes at retail through 15 or more separate establishments\nwhich are located in New York State. The Cooperative Corporations Law defines a\ncooperative, in pertinent part, as a corporation organized under such law or\nunder any former special or general law of the State, for the cooperative\nrendering of mutual help and service to its members. In order to qualify as a\ncooperative member for purposes of this Title, a dealer must share in the\nprofits and losses of the cooperative and must have purchased at least 25\npercent of the merchandise it purchased for resale during the preceding\ncalendar year from such cooperative, excluding cigarettes and petroleum\nproducts. Such volume of purchases will be measured by the amount paid for such\nmerchandise, prior to any patronage dividends or refunds based on\npatronage. (ii)\n\nThe registrations\nof those cooperative members registered as chain stores prior to July 22, 1990\n(the effective date of chapter 744 of the Laws of 1990) will not be revoked by\nreason of their failure to belong to a cooperative that operates a distribution\ncenter, or to share in the profits and losses of the cooperative, or to meet\nthe 25 percent purchase requirement. Upon each successive registration pursuant\nto Part 81 of this Title, such cooperative members will not be subject to such\nrequirements, but shall be subject to all other requirements of article 20-A of\nthe Tax Law. Since a chain store's registration is not assignable, the\nprovisions of this subparagraph do not apply where there has been a change in\nownership of a cooperative member on or after such effective date (see section\n81.1\n[a]\nof this Title). (5)\n\nFranchisees. Chain store includes franchisees. A\nfranchisee\nfor such purpose means any person or persons engaged in the sale of cigarettes\nas a retail dealer who is a franchisee as defined in article 33 of the General\n\nBusiness Law, and whose franchisor franchises 15 or more separate retail\nestablishments located in New York State through which cigarettes are sold at\nretail. The General Business Law defines a franchisee as a person to whom a\nfranchise is granted. As defined, in pertinent part, in article 33 of such law, a\nfranchise\nmeans a contract or agreement by which a\nfranchisee, in return for a franchise fee, is granted the right to engage in\nthe business of offering, selling or distributing: (i) goods or services under a marketing plan\nor system prescribed in substantial part by a franchisor; or\n(ii)\ngoods or services substantially\nassociated with the franchisor's trademark, service mark, trade name, logotype, advertising or other commercial symbol of the franchisor or its affiliates. A\nfranchise for purposes of article 33 of the General Business Law does not\ninclude any agreement, contract or franchise subject to the provisions of\narticle 11-B of such law, with respect to franchises for the sale of motor\nfuels, or any agreement or contract for the sale of motor fuels. Where the\nexistence of a franchise or a franchisor-franchisee relationship is in\nquestion, the department may defer to the judgment of the New York State\n\nDepartment of Law, which is charged with the administration of article 33 of\nthe General Business Law. (6)\n\nLarge volume outlet operators. Chain\nstore shall also include large volume outlet operators. A\nlarge volume\noutlet operator\nmeans any person or persons who sell cigarettes at one\nor more retail outlets, located in New York State, each of which had annual\ngross sales in this State in the previous calendar year of more than two\nmillion dollars. Gross sales\nfor purposes of this paragraph\nshall mean an individual retail outlet' s total receipts for the sale of\ntangible personal property (as defined in section\n526.8\nof this Title) other than petroleum products, exclusive of any deduction\nwhatsoever. Gross sales in any portion of the previous calendar year shall not\nbe annualized in computing the more than two-million dollar\nthreshold. (d) Retail dealer\nfor purposes of this Article means any person\nengaged in selling cigarettes at retail. The term retail dealer is also defined\nin article 20 of the Tax Law with respect to the cigarette tax and the tobacco\nproducts tax (see Articles 1 and 3 of this Subchapter).

A CMSA retail\ndealer shall include a licensed cigarette agent, a licensed CMSA wholesale\ndealer, a registered chain store or any other person with respect to their\nsales of cigarettes to consumers. (See also, Part 73 of this Title for retail\ndealer and vending machine registrations.)\n(e) For definitions of cost of the agent, cost of the CMSA wholesale dealer and cost of the CMSA retail dealer, see\nsections\n82.2\n(b), 82.3\n(b) and\n82.5\n(b), respectively, of this Title.
