  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 417.5 - Licensing of importing transporters\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 283-a\n(a) (1)\n\nThe\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, upon application of a person who or which\nhas the use or control or the right to use or control any means of\ntransportation used to transport motor fuel being imported into the State for\nuse, distribution, storage or sale in the State, may license such person as an\nimporting transporter. No person, unless so licensed, may transport motor fuel\nin the State where such fuel is being so imported. An application for a license\nas an importing transporter must be made on a form prescribed by the Department\nof Taxation and Finance for such purpose and must fully disclose all of the\ninformation requested therein. (2)\n(i) An importing transporter must immediately\ninform the Department of Taxation and Finance, in writing, of any change in its\naddress. Additionally, an importing transporter which is a corporation or a\npartnership must immediately inform the department, in writing, of any changes\nin such transporter's officers, directors or partners or any changes in such\npersons' addresses as shown in the transporter's application for a\nlicense. (ii)\n\nWhen shares of stock\nare acquired by any person such that an importing transporter which had four or\nfewer shareholders owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, the voting\nstock of such importing transporter upon such acquisition has more than four\nshareholders so owning or controlling such stock, the importing transporter\nmust immediately file a notification of such acquisitions with the department. However, if in any such acquisitions, a person not previously owning or\ncontrolling, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of the shares of\nvoting stock of such importing transporter acquires shares of stock such that\nthe person owns or controls, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of\nthe shares of voting stock of such importing transporter, such acquisition is a\ntransfer of license subject to the provisions of section\n417.7\nof this Part. (b) (1)\n\nBefore any person may be licensed as an importing transporter with the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, and at all times after the person is\nlicensed as an importing transporter, such person is required to file or\ndeposit and maintain with the department: (i) a performance bond executed by a surety company which is (\na\n)\nauthorized to transact business in this State, (\nb\n) registered\nwith and under the supervision of the Insurance Department of New York State, and (\nc\n) approved by the Superintendent of Insurance as to\nsolvency and responsibility; or\n(ii)\nsuch other acceptable security\nenumerated in section\n411.3\nof this Title (provided, however, in applying such section \"distributor\" shall\nbe read as \"importing transporter\"). Such bond or security is to secure that\nthe licensee will properly perform the duties and responsibilities of an\nimporting transporter as required pursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law, and\npursuant to articles 28 and 29 of the Tax Law with respect to motor fuel and\nrules and regulations promulgated thereunder and that such licensee will not\nsuffer or permit any violations of such provisions of the Tax Law or rules or\nregulations or give cause for the cancellation or suspension of his license. In\nthe case of an importing transporter a bond to the people of the State of New\n\nYork, or acceptable security, in the penal sum of $2,000 must be filed or\ndeposited. Provided, however, if an applicant for a license is also registered\nas a distributor of motor fuel and if the department believes that a possible\nrevocation of the registration as a distributor is sanction enough to secure\ncompliance with the Tax Law and rules and regulations adopted thereunder, the\ndepartment may dispense with the requirement that a bond or security be filed\nor deposited in respect of its activities as an importing\ntransporter. (2)\n\nIf the\nlicensee fails to perform the duties and responsibilities of an importing\ntransporter required pursuant to article 12-A and articles 28 and 29 and the\nrules or regulations relating thereto with respect to motor fuel or suffers or\npermits any violations of such provisions of the Tax Law or rules or\nregulations or gives cause for cancellation or suspension of its license, the\ndepartment may proceed to cancel or suspend such license by the issuance of a\nnotice of nonperformance or cause for cancellation or suspension. Such notice\nmust specify the violation or violations or grounds for cancellation or\nsuspension. The notice will be served in the same manner as a notice of\nproposed cancellation under section\n283 (6)\nof the Tax Law (see\nsection\n411.7\nof this Title) and all the provisions of such section 283(6) with respect to a\nnotice of proposed cancellation are applicable to a notice of nonperformance or\ncause for cancellation or suspension, including opportunity for a hearing and\ntime limits with respect thereto, with such modification as may be necessary to\nadapt the language of such provision to the notice hereunder. (c) (1)\n\nWhere a person files an application for a\nlicense as an importing transporter, the Department of Taxation and Finance in\ncircumstances described herein, may refuse to license such applicant and deny\nsuch application, without a prior hearing, pursuant to the provisions of this\nsubdivision.
