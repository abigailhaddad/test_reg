(2)\n\nRules of court; contempt. The military\njudge may: (i) subject to N.Y.R.C.M. 108, promulgate and enforce rules of court; and\n(ii)\nsubject to N.Y.R.C.M. 809, exercise\ncontempt power. (3)\n\nObtaining evidence. The court-martial may act to obtain evidence in addition to\nthat presented by the parties. The right of the members to have additional\nevidence obtained is subject to an interlocutory ruling by the military\njudge. (4)\n\nUncharged offenses. If\nduring the trial there is evidence that the accused may be guilty of an untried\noffense not alleged in any specification before the court-martial, the\ncourt-martial must proceed with the trial of the offense charged. (5)\n\nInterlocutory questions and questions of\nlaw. For purposes of this paragraph \"military judge\" does not include the\npresident of a special court-martial without a military judge. (i) Rulings by the military judge. (a) Finality of rulings. Any ruling by the\nmilitary judge upon a question of law, including a motion for a finding of not\nguilty, or upon any interlocutory question is final. (b) Changing a ruling. The military judge may\nchange a ruling made by that or another military judge in the case except a\npreviously granted motion for a finding of not guilty, at any time during the\ntrial. (c) Sessions under ML, 130.39(a). When required by this Chapter or otherwise deemed appropriate by the\nmilitary judge, interlocutory questions or questions of law must be presented\nand decided at sessions held without members under N.Y.R.C.M. 803. (ii)\n\nRulings by the president of a\nspecial court-martial without a military judge. (a) Questions of law. Any ruling by the\npresident of a special court-martial without a military judge on any question\nof law other than a motion for a finding of not guilty is final. (b) Questions of fact. Any ruling by the\npresident of a special court-martial without a military judge on any\ninterlocutory question of fact, including a factual issue of mental capacity of\nthe accused, or on a motion for a finding of not guilty, is final unless\nobjected to by a member. (c) Changing a ruling. The president of a special court-martial without a military\njudge may change a ruling made by that or another president in the case except\na previously granted motion for a finding of not guilty, at any time during the\ntrial. (d) Presence of members. Except as provided in N.Y.R.C.M. 505 and 911, all members will be present at\nall sessions of a special court-martial without military judge, including\nsessions at which questions of law or interlocutory questions are litigated. However, the president of a special court-martial without a military judge may\nexamine an offered item of real or documentary evidence before ruling on its\nadmissibility without exposing it to other members. (iii)\n\nProcedures for rulings by the president\nof a special court-martial without a military judge which are subject to\nobjection by a member. (a) Determination. The\npresident of a special court-martial without a military judge determines\nwhether a ruling is subject to objection. (b) Instructions. When a ruling by the\npresident of a special court-martial without a military judge which is subject\nto objection, the president is to so advise the members and must give such\ninstructions on the issue as may be necessary to enable the members to\nunderstand the issue and the legal standards by which they will determine it if\nobjection is made. (c) Voting. When\na member objects to a ruling by the president of a special court-martial\nwithout a military judge which is subject to objection, the court-martial must\nbe closed, and the members must vote orally, beginning with the junior in rank, and the question must be decided by a majority vote. A tie vote on a motion for\na finding of not guilty is a determination against the accused. A tie vote on\nany other question is a determination in favor of the accused. (d) Consultation. The president of a special\ncourt-martial without a military judge may close the court-martial and consult\nwith other members before ruling on a matter, when such ruling is subject to\nthe objection of any member. (iv)\n\nStandard of proof. Questions of fact in\nan interlocutory question are to be determined by a preponderance of the\nevidence, unless otherwise stated in this Chapter. In the absence of a\nsubdivision in this Chapter assigning the burden of persuasion, the party\nmaking the motion or raising the objection bears the burden of\npersuasion. (v) Scope. This\nparagraph applies to the disposition of questions of law and interlocutory\nquestions arising during trial except the question whether a challenge should\nbe sustained. (6)\n\nRulings on record. All sessions involving rulings or instructions made or given\nby the military judge or the president of a special court-martial without a\nmilitary judge are to be made a part of the record. All rulings and\ninstructions are to be made or given in open session in the presence of the\nparties and the members, except as otherwise may be determined in the\ndiscretion of the military judge. For purposes of this paragraph, \"military\njudge\" does not include the president of a special court-martial without a\nmilitary judge. (7)\n\nEffect of\nfailure to raise defenses or objections. Failure by a party to raise defenses\nor objections or to make requests or motions which must be made at the time set\nby this Chapter or by the military judge under authority or this Chapter, or\nprior to any extension thereof made by the military judge constitutes waiver\nthereof, but the military judge for good cause shown may grant relief from the\nwaiver. (b) Conferences. (1)\n\nIn general. After referral, the military\njudge may, upon request of any party or sua sponte, order one or more\nconferences with the parties to consider such matters as will promote a fair\nand expeditious trial. (2)\n\nMatters\non record. Conferences need not be made part of the record, but matters agreed\nupon at a conference are to be included in the record orally or in writing. Failure of a party to object at trial to failure to comply with this paragraph\nwaives this requirement. (3)\n\nRights\nof parties. A conference cannot proceed over the objection of any party. No\nparty may be prevented under this rule from presenting evidence or from making\nany argument, objection, or motion at trial. (4)\n\nAccused's presence. The presence of the\naccused is neither required nor prohibited at a conference. (5)\n\nAdmission. No admissions made by the\naccused or defense counsel at a conference are to be used against the accused\nunless the admissions are reduced to writing and signed by the accused and\ndefense counsel. (6)\n\nLimitations. This subdivision cannot be invoked in the case of an accused who is not\nrepresented by counsel, or in special courts-martial without a military\njudge. (c) Court-martial\nsessions without members under 130.39(a), ML. A military judge who has been\ndetailed to the court-martial may, under 130.39(a), ML, after service of\ncharges, call the court-martial into session without the presence of members. Such sessions may be held before and after assembly of the court-martial, and\nwhen authorized in these rules, after adjournment and before action by the\nconvening authority. All such sessions are a part of the trial and must be\nconducted in the presence of the accused, defense counsel, and trial counsel, in accordance with N.Y.R.C.M 804 and 805, and must be made a part of the\nrecord. For purposes of this rule \"military judge\" does not include the\npresident of a special court-martial without a military judge. (d) Presence of the accused at trial\nproceedings. (1)\n\nPresence required. The\naccused shall be present at the arraignment, the time of the plea, every stage\nof the trial including sessions conducted under 130.39(a), ML, voir dire and\nchallenges of members, the return of the findings, sentencing proceedings, and\npost-trial sessions, if any, except as otherwise provided by this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nContinued presence\nnot required. The further progress of the trial to and including the return of\nthe findings and, if necessary, determination of a sentence cannot be prevented\nand the accused must be considered to have waived the right to be present\nwhenever an accused, initially present: (i) is voluntarily absent after arraignment (where informed by the military judge\nof the obligation to remain during the trial); or\n(ii)\nafter being warned by the military judge\nthat disruptive conduct will cause the accused to be removed from the\ncourtroom, persists in conduct which is such as to justify exclusion from the\ncourtroom. (3)\n\nPersons\ncharged with absence without leave under 130.82, ML. The presence of the\naccused at any time described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision is not\nrequired at a special court-martial empowered to adjudge a bad conduct\ndischarge where, and the accused must be considered to have waived the right to\nbe present at such court-martial if such court-martial obtains in personam\njurisdiction over him by any method of personal service described in 130.3(d), ML; provided that a warning accompanies the charge sheet in substantially the\nfollowing format: \"WARNING: You have a right to be present at your\ncourt-martial. In the event you fail to appear, the court-martial may proceed\nin your absence.\"\n(4)\n\nAppearance and security of accused. (i) Appearance. The accused must be properly attired in the uniform or dress\nprescribed by the military judge. An accused service member must wear the\ninsignia of grade and may wear any decorations, emblems, or ribbons to which\nentitled. The accused and defense counsel are responsible for ensuring that the\naccused is properly attired; however, upon request, the accused's commander is\nto render such assistance as may be reasonably necessary to ensure that the\naccused is properly attired. (ii)\n\nCustody. Responsibility for maintaining custody or control of an accused before\nand during trial may be assigned, subject to N.Y.R.C.M. 304 and 305, and\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. (iii)\n\nRestraint. Physical restraint cannot be\nimposed on the accused during open sessions of the court-martial unless\nprescribed by the military judge. (e) Presence of military judge, members, and\ncounsel. (1)\n\nMilitary judge. No court-\nmartial proceeding, except the deliberations of the members, may take place in\nthe absence of the military judge, if detailed (ML, 130.26[a]). (2)\n\nMembers. Unless trial is by military\njudge alone pursuant to a request by the accused, no court-martial proceeding\nmay take place in the absence of any detailed member except: sessions under ML, 130.39(a) under N.Y.R.C.M. 803; examination of members under N.Y.R.C.M. 910(d); when the member has been excused under N.Y.R.C.M. 505 or 910(f); or as\notherwise provided in N.Y.R.C.M. 1102 (See ML, 130.29[a]). No general\ncourt-martial proceeding requiring the presence of members may be conducted\nunless at least 5 members are present and, except as provided in N.Y.R.C.M. 910(h), no special court-martial proceeding requiring the presence of members\nmay be conducted unless at least three members are present (ML, 130.29[b] and\n[c]). Except as provided in N.Y.R.C.M. 503(b), when an enlisted accused has\nrequested enlisted members, no proceeding requiring the presence of members may\nbe conducted unless at least one-third of the members actually sitting on the\ncourt-martial are enlisted persons (ML, 130.25[c][1]). (3)\n\nCounsel. As long as at least one\nqualified counsel for each party is present, other counsel for each party may\nbe absent from a court-martial session. An assistant counsel who lacks the\nqualifications necessary to serve as counsel for a party may not act at a\nsession in the absence of such qualified counsel. (4)\n\nEffect of replacement of member or\nmilitary judge. (i) Members. When after the\npresentation of evidence on the merits has begun, a new member is detailed\nunder N.Y.R.C.M. 505(c)(2)(B), trial may not proceed unless the testimony and\nevidence previously admitted on the merits, if recorded verbatim, is read to\nthe new member in the presence of the military judge, the accused, and counsel\nfor both sides; or, if not recorded verbatim, and in the absence of a\nstipulation as to such testimony and evidence, the trial proceeds as if no\nevidence has been presented (ML, 130.29[b] and [c]). (ii)\n\nMilitary judge. When, after the\npresentation of evidence on the merits has begun in trial before military judge\nalone, a new military judge is detailed under N.Y.R.C.M. 505(e)(2) trial may\nnot proceed unless the accused requests, and the military judge approves, trial\nby military judge alone, and a verbatim record of the testimony and evidence or\na stipulation thereof is read to the military judge in the presence of the new\nmilitary judge, the accused, and counsel for both sides; or the trial proceeds\nas if no evidence has been presented (ML, 130.29[d]). (f) Public trial. (1)\n\nIn general. Except as otherwise provided\nin this subdivision, courts-martial are open to the public. For purposes of\nthis subdivision, public includes members of both the military and civilian\ncommunities. (2)\n\nControl of\nspectators. In order to maintain the dignity and decorum of the proceedings or\nfor other good cause, the military judge may reasonably limit the number of\nspectators in, and the means of access to, the courtroom, exclude specific\npersons from the courtroom, and close a session; however, a session may be\nclosed over the objection of the accused only when expressly authorized by\nanother provision of this Chapter. (3)\n\nPhotography and broadcasting prohibited. Video and audio recording and the taking of photographs -- except for the\npurpose of preparing the record of trial -- in the courtroom during the\nproceedings and radio or television broadcasting of proceedings from the\ncourtroom shall not be permitted. However, the military judge may, as a matter\nof discretion permit contemporaneous closed-circuit video or audio transmission\nto permit viewing or hearing by an accused removed under N.Y.R.C.M. 804 or by\nspectators when courtroom facilities are inadequate to accommodate a reasonable\nnumber of spectators. (g) Oaths. (1)\n\nDefinition. Oath includes\n\"affirmation\". (2)\n\nOaths in\ncourt-martial. (i) Who must be sworn. (a) Court-martial personnel. The military\njudge, members of a general or special court-martial, trial counsel, assistant\ntrial counsel, defense counsel, associate defense counsel, assistant defense\ncounsel, reporter, interpreter, and escort must take an oath to perform their\nduties faithfully (130.42[a], ML). For purposes of this subdivision, \"defense\ncounsel\", \"associate defense counsel\", and \"assistant defense counsel\" include\ndetailed and individual military and civilian counsel. (b) Witnesses. Each witness before a\ncourt-martial must be examined on oath. (ML, 130.42[b]). (ii)\n\nProcedure for administering oaths. Any\nprocedure which appeals to the conscience of the person to whom the oath is\nadministered and which binds that person to speak the truth, or, in the case of\none other than a witness, properly to perform certain duties, is\nsufficient. (h) Record of trial. The trial counsel of a\ngeneral or special court-martial must take such action as may be necessary to\nensure that a record which will meet the requirements of N.Y.R.C.M. 1103 can be\nprepared. (i) Contempt proceedings. (1)\n\nIn general. Courts-martial may exercise\ncontempt power under ML, 130.48. (2)\n\nMethod of disposition. (i) Summary disposition. When conduct\nconstituting con tempt is directly witnessed by the court-martial, the conduct\nmay be punished summarily. In such cases, the regular proceedings must be\nsuspended while the contempt is disposed of. (ii)\n\nDisposition upon notice and hearing. When the conduct apparently constituting contempt is not directly witnessed by\nthe court-martial, the alleged offender must be brought before the\ncourt-martial and informed orally or in writing of the alleged contempt. The\nalleged offender must be given a reasonable opportunity to present evidence, including calling witnesses. The alleged offender must have the right to be\nrepresented by counsel and evidence, including calling witnesses. The alleged\noffender must have the right to be represented by counsel and shall be so\nadvised. The contempt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt before it may be\npunished. (3)\n\nProcedure; who may punish for contempt. (i) Members not\npresent. When the conduct allegedly constituting contempt occurs during a\nsession when the members are not present, the military judge must determine\nwhether to punish for contempt, and, if so, what the punishment is to be. The\nmilitary judge may punish summarily under subparagraph (2)(i) of this\nsubdivision only if the military judge recited the facts for the record and\nstates that they were directly witnessed by the military judge in the actual\npresence of the court-martial. (ii)\n\nMembers present. When the conduct allegedly constituting contempt occurs during\na session when the members are present, contempt proceedings may be initiated\nby the military judge or upon motion of any member, unless the military judge\nrules that as a matter of law, contempt has not been committed. If contempt\nproceedings are initiated the following procedures apply. (a) Instructions. The military judge must\ninstruct the members so that they can properly decide the questions\npresented. (b) Findings. The\nmembers must decide in a closed session, upon vote by secret written ballot\nwhether to hold an alleged offender in contempt. At least two-thirds of the\nmembers must concur in a finding of contempt to convict unless that member\ndirectly witnessed the conduct in question in the presence of the court-martial\nand finds it to be contemptuous. (c) Sentence. If the members find the\noffender in contempt, they must, without reopening the court-martial, determine\nthe punishment in accordance with the procedures in N.Y.R.C.M. 1006. (d) Announcement. After reaching findings, and, if necessary, a sentence, the court-martial must be reopened and the\nresults announced by the president. (4)\n\nRecord; review. A record of the contempt\nproceedings must be part of the record of the court-martial during which it\noccurred. If the person was held in contempt, then a separate record of the\ncontempt proceedings must be prepared and forwarded to the convening authority\nfor review. The convening authority may approve or disapprove all or part of\nthe sentence. The action of the convening authority is not subject to further\nreview or appeal. (5)\n\nSentence. A\nsentence of confinement pursuant to a finding of contempt begins to run when it\nis adjudged unless deferred, suspended, or disapproved by the convening\nauthority. The place of confinement for a civilian or military person who is\nheld in contempt and is to be punished by confinement must be designated by the\nconvening authority. A fine does not become effective until ordered executed by\nthe convening authority. The military judge may delay announcing the sentence\nafter a finding of contempt to permit the person involved to continue to\nparticipate in the proceedings. (6)\n\nInforming person held in contempt. The person held in contempt must be informed\nby the convening authority in writing of the holding and sentence, if any, of\nthe court-martial and of the action of the convening authority upon the\nsentence. (j) Procedures\nfor rehearings, new trials, and other trials. (1)\n\nIn general. (i) Rehearings in full and new or other\ntrials. In rehearings which require findings on all charges and specifications\nreferred to a court-martial and in new or other trials, the procedure is the\nsame as in an original trial except as otherwise provided in this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nRehearings on\nsentence only. In a rehearing on sentence only, the procedure is the same as in\nan original trial, except that the portion of the procedure which ordinarily\noccurs after challenges and through and including the findings is omitted, and\nexcept as otherwise provided in this subdivision. (a) Contents of the record. The contents of\nthe record of the original trial consisting of evidence properly admitted on\nthe merits relating to each offense of which the accused stands convicted but\nnot sentenced may be established by any party whether or not testimony so read\nis otherwise admissible under Mil. R. Evid. 804(b)(1) and whether or not it was\ngiven through an interpreter. (b) Plea. The accused at a rehearing only on sentence may not withdraw any plea of\nguilty upon which findings of guilty are based. However, if such a plea is\nfound to be improvident, the rehearing must be suspended and the matter\nreported to the authority ordering the rehearing. (iii)\n\nCombined rehearings. When a rehearing\non sentence is combined with a trial on the merits of one of more\nspecifications referred to the court-martial, whether or not such\nspecifications are being tried for the first time or reheard, the trial will\nproceed first on the merits, without reference to the offenses being reheard on\nsentence only. After findings on the merits are announced, the members, if any, must be advised of the offenses on which the rehearing on sentence has bean\ndirected. Additional challenges for cause may be permitted, and the sentencing\nprocedure must be the same as at an original trial, except as otherwise\nprovided in this subdivision. A single sentence must be adjudged for all\noffenses. (2)\n\nComposition. (i) Members. No member of the\ncourt-martial which previously heard the case may sit as a member of the\ncourt-martial at any rehearing, new trial, or other trial of the same case (ML, 130.62). (ii)\n\nMilitary judge. The\nmilitary judge at a rehearing may be the same military judge who presided over\na previous trial of the same case. The existence or absence of a request for\ntrial by military judge alone at a previous hearing has no effect on the\ncomposition of a court-martial on rehearing. (iii)\n\nAccused's election. The accused at a\nrehearing or new or other trial has the same right to request enlisted members\nor trial by military judge alone as the accused would have at an original\ntrial. (3)\n\nExamination\nof record of former proceedings. No member may, upon a rehearing or upon a new\nor other trial, examine the record of any former proceedings in the same case\nexcept: (i) when permitted to do so by the\nmilitary judge after such matters have been received in evidence; or\n(ii)\nthat the president of a special\ncourt-martial without a military judge may examine that part of the record of\nformer proceedings which relates to errors committed at the former proceedings\nwhen necessary to decide the admissibility of offered evidence or other\nquestions of law, and such a part of the record may be read to the members when\nnecessary for them to consider a matter subject to objection by any\nmember. (4)\n\nSentence\nlimitations. (i) In general. Except as\notherwise provided in paragraph (ii) of this paragraph, offenses on which a\nrehearing, new trial, or other trial has been ordered cannot be the basis for\npunishment in excess of or more severe than the legal sentence adjudged at the\nprevious trial or hearing, as ultimately reduced by the convening or higher\nauthority, unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory (ML, 130.62). When a rehearing on sentencing is combined with trial on new charges, the maximum punishment is the maximum punishment for the offenses being reheard\nas limited above plus the total maximum punishment under N.Y.R.C.M. 1003 for\nany new charges of which the accused has been found guilty. In the case of an\n\"other trial\" no sentence limitations apply if the original trial was invalid\nbecause a summary or special court-martial improperly tried an offense\ninvolving a mandatory punishment or one otherwise considered capital. (ii)\n\nPretrial agreement. If, after the\nearlier court-martial, the sentence was approved in accordance with a pretrial\nagreement and at the rehearing the accused fails to comply with the pretrial\nagreement, by failing to enter a plea of guilty or otherwise, the sentence as\nto the affected charges and specifications may include any otherwise lawful\npunishment not in excess of or more severe than that lawfully adjudged at the\nearlier court-martial. (5)\n\nDefinition. Other trial means another\ntrial of a case in which the original proceedings were declared invalid because\nof lack of jurisdiction or failure of a charge to state an offense. (k) Stipulations. (1)\n\nIn general. The parties may make an oral\nor written stipulation to any fact, the contents of a document, or the expected\ntestimony of a witness. (2)\n\nAuthority to reject. The military judge may, in the interest of justice, decline to accept a stipulation. (3)\n\nRequirements. Before accepting a\nstipulation in evidence, the military judge must be satisfied that the parties\nconsent to its admission. (4)\n\nWithdrawal. A party may withdraw from an agreement to stipulate or from a\nstipulation at any time before a stipulation is accepted; the stipulation may\nnot then be accepted. After a stipulation has been accepted a party may\nwithdraw from it only if permitted to do so in the discretion of the military\njudge. (5)\n\nEffect of stipulations. Unless properly withdrawn or ordered stricken from the record, a stipulation of\nfact that has been accepted is binding on the court-martial and may not be\ncontradicted by the parties thereto. The contents of a stipulation of expected\ntestimony or of a document's contents may be attacked, contradicted, or\nexplained in the same way as if the witness had actually so testified or the\ndocument had been actually admitted. The fact that the parties so stipulated\ndoes not admit the truth of the indicated testimony or document's contents, nor\ndoes it add anything to the evidentiary nature of the testimony or document. The Military Rules of Evidence apply to the contents of stipulation. (6)\n\nProcedure. When offered, a written\nstipulation must be presented to the military judge and must be included in the\nrecord whether accepted or not. Once accepted, a written stipulation of\nexpected testimony must be read to the members, if any, but cannot be presented\nto them; a written stipulation of fact or of a document's contents may be read\nto the members, if any, presented to them, or both. Once accepted, an oral\nstipulation must be announced to the members, if any. (l) Joint and common trials. In joint trials\nand in common trials, each accused must be accorded the rights and privileges\nas if tried separately. (m) Announcing personnel of the court-martial and accused. (1)\n\nOpening sessions. When the court-martial\nis called to order for the first time in a case, the military judge must ensure\nthat the following is announced: (i) the\norder, including any amendment, by which the court-martial is\nconvened; (ii)\nthe name, rank, and\nunit or address or the accused; (iii)\nthe name and rank of the military\njudge, if one has been detailed; (iv)\nthe names and ranks of the members, if\nany, who are present; (v) the names\nand ranks of members who are absent, if presence of members is\nrequired; (vi)\nthe names and ranks\n(if any) of counsel who are present; and\n(vii)\nthe names and ranks (if any) of counsel\nwho are absent; (viii)\nthe name and\nrank (if any) of any detailed court reporter. (2)\n\nLater proceedings. When the court-martial\nis called to order after a recess or adjournment or after it has been closed\nfor any reason, the military judge must ensure that the record reflects whether\nall parties and members who were present at the time of the adjournment or\nrecess, or at the time the court-martial closed, are present. (3)\n\nAdditions, replacement, and absences of\npersonnel. Whenever there is a replacement of the military judge, any member, or counsel, either through the appearance of new personnel or personnel\npreviously absent or through the absence of personnel previously present, the\nmilitary judge must ensure the record reflects the change and the reason for\nit.
