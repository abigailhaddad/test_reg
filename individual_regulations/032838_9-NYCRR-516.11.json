  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 516.11 - Post-trial procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Report of result of trial; post-trial restraint; deferment of confinement. (1)\n\nReport of the result of trial. After\nfinal adjournment of the court-martial in a case, the trial counsel must\npromptly notify the accused's immediate commander, the convening authority or\nthe convening authority's designee, and, if appropriate, the officer in charge\nof the confinement facility of the findings and sentence (See ML, 130.60[a]). (2)\n\nPost-trial\nconfinement. (i) In general. An accused may\nbe placed in post-trial confinement if the sentence adjudged by the\ncourt-martial includes confinement (ML, 130.57[b]). (ii)\n\nWho may order confinement. Unless\nlimited by superior authority, a commander of the accused may order the accused\ninto post-trial confinement when post-trial confinement is authorized under\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph. A commander authorized to order post-trial\nconfinement under this paragraph may delegate this authority to the trial\ncounsel. (iii)\n\nConfinement on other\ngrounds. Nothing in this subdivision prohibits confinement of a person after a\ncourt-martial on proper grounds other than the offenses for which the accused\nwas tried at that court-martial. (3)\n\nDeferment of confinement. (i) In general. Deferment of a sentence to\nconfinement is a postponement of the service and of the running of the sentence\n(ML, 130.57[d]). (ii)\n\nWho may\ndefer. The convening authority or, if the accused is no longer in the convening\nauthority's jurisdiction, the officer exercising general court-martial\njurisdiction over the command to which the accused is assigned, may, upon\nwritten application of the accused, at any time after the adjournment of the\ncourt-martial, defer the accused's service of a sentence to confinement which\nhas not been ordered executed. (iii)\n\nAction on deferment request. The\nauthority acting on the deferment request may, in that authority's discretion, defer service of a sentence to confinement. The accused has the burden to show\nthat the interests of the accused and the community in release outweigh the\ncommunity's interests in confinement. Factors that the authority acting on a\ndeferment request may consider in determining whether to grant the deferment\nrequest include: the probability of the accused's flight; the probability of\nthe accused's commission of other offenses, intimidation of witness, or\ninterference with the administration of justice; the nature of the offenses\n(including the effect on the victim) of which the accused was convicted; the\nsentence adjudged; the command's immediate need for the accused; the effect of\ndeferment on good order and discipline in the command; and the accused's\ncharacter, mental condition, family situation, and service record. The decision\nof the authority acting on the deferment shall be subject to judicial review\nonly for abuse of discretion. The action of the convening authority shall be\nwritten and a copy shall be provided to the accused. (iv)\n\nOrders. The action granting deferment\nmust be reported in the convening authority's action under N.Y.R.C.M. 1107(f)(4)(E) and must include the date of the action on the request when it\noccurs prior to or concurrently with the action. Action granting deferment\nafter the convening authority's action under N.Y.R.C.M. 1107 must be reported\nin orders under N.Y.R.C.M. 1114 and included in the record of trial. (v) Restraint when deferment is granted. When\ndeferment of confinement is granted, no form of restraint or other limitation\non the accused's liberty may be ordered as a substitute form of\npunishment. (vi)\n\nEnd of deferment. Deferment of a sentence to confinement ends when: (a) the convening authority takes action\nunder N.Y.R.C.M. 1107, unless the convening authority specifies in the action\nthat service of confinement after the action is deferred; (b) the confinement is suspended; (c) the deferment expires by it own terms; or\n(d) the deferment is otherwise\nrescinded in accordance with subparagraph (vii) of this paragraph. Deferment of confinement may not continue after the\nconviction is final under N.Y.R.C.M. 1209. (vii)\n\nRescission of deferment. (a) Who may rescind. The authority who\ngranted the deferment or, if the accused is no longer within that authority's\njurisdiction, the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over\nthe command to which the accused is assigned, may rescind the\ndeferment. (b) Action. Deferment of\nconfinement may be rescinded when additional information is presented to a\nproper authority which, when considered with all other information in the case, that authority finds, in that authority's discretion, is grounds for denial of\ndeferment under subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. The accused must promptly\nbe informed of the basis for the rescission and of the right to submit written\nmatters in the accused's behalf and to request that the rescission be\nreconsidered. However, the accused may be required to serve the sentence to\nconfinement pending this action. (c) Execution. When deferment is rescinded\nafter the convening authority's action under N.Y.R.C.M. 1107, the confinement\nmay be ordered executed. However, no such order may be issued within seven days\nof notice of the rescission to the accused under clause (b) of this\nsubparagraph, to afford the accused an opportunity to respond. The authority\nrescinding the deferment may extend this period for good cause shown. The\naccused must be credited with any confinement actually served during this\nperiod. (d) Orders. Rescission of a\ndeferment before or concurrently with the initial action in the case must be\nreported in the action under N.Y.R.C.M 1107(f)(4)(E), which action includes the\ndates of the granting of the deferment and the rescission. Rescission of a\ndeferment after the convening authority's action must be reported in\nsupplementary orders in accordance with N.Y.R.C.M. 1114 and must state whether\nthe approved period of confinement is to be executed or whether all or part of\nit is to be suspended. (b) Post-trial sessions. (1)\n\nIn general. Post-trial sessions may be\nproceedings in revision or sessions under ML, 130.39(a). Such sessions may be\ndirected by the military judge or the convening authority in accordance with\nthis subdivision (See ML, 130.60[e]). (2)\n\nPurpose. (i) Proceedings in revision. Proceedings in\nrevision may be directed to correct an apparent error, omission, or improper or\ninconsistent action by the court-martial, which can be rectified by reopening\nthe proceedings without material prejudice to the accused. (ii)\n\nSessions under ML, 130.39(a). A session\ncalled under ML, 130.39(a) under this subdivision may be called for the purpose\nof inquiring into, and, when appropriate, resolving any matter which arises\nafter trial and which substantially affects the legal sufficiency of any\nfindings of guilty or the sentence. (3)\n\nMatters not subject to post-trial\nsessions. Post-trial sessions may not be directed: (i) for reconsideration of a finding of not\nguilty of any specification, or a ruling which amounts to a finding of not\nguilty; (ii)\nfor reconsideration of\na finding of not guilty of any charge, unless the record shows a finding of\nguilty under a specification laid under that charge, which sufficiently alleges\na violation of some article of the code; or\n(iii)\nfor increasing the severity of the\nsentence unless the sentence prescribed for the offense is mandatory. (4)\n\nWhen directed. The military\njudge may direct a post-trial session any time before the record is\nauthenticated. The convening authority may direct a post- trial session any\ntime before the convening authority takes initial action on the case or at such\nlater time as the convening authority is authorized to do so by a reviewing\nauthority, except that no proceeding in revision may be held when any part of\nthe sentence has been ordered executed. (5)\n\nProcedure. (i) Personnel. The requirements of N.Y.R.C.M. 505 and 805 apply at post-trial sessions except that: (a) For a proceeding in revision, if trial\nwas before members and the matter subject to the proceeding in revision\nrequires the presence of members: (1)\nthe\nabsence of any members does not invalidate the proceedings if, in the case of a\ngeneral court-martial, at least five members are present, or in the case of a\nspecial court-martial, at least three members are present; and\n(2)\na different military judge may be\ndetailed, subject to N.Y.R.C.M. 502(c) and 902, if the military judge who\npresided at the earlier proceedings is not reasonably available. (b) For a session under ML, 130.39(a), a different military judge may be detailed, subject to N.Y.R.C.M. 502(c) and 902, for good cause. (ii)\n\nAction. The military judge must take\nsuch action as may be appropriate, including appropriate instructions when\nmembers are present. The members may deliberate in closed session, if\nnecessary, to determine what corrective action, if any, to take. (iii)\n\nRecord. All post-trial sessions, except\nany deliberations by the members, must be held in open session.

(7)\n\nCopies of the record of trial. (i) General and special courts-martial. (a) In general. In general and special\ncourts-martial which require a verbatim transcript under paragraphs (2) or (3)\nof this subdivision, the trial counsel must cause to be prepared an original\nand four copies of the record of trial. In all other general and special\ncourts-martial the trial counsel must cause to be prepared an original and one\ncopy of the record of trial. (b) Additional copies.

No person may be required\nto authenticate a record of trial if that person is not satisfied that it\naccurately reports the proceedings. (ii)\n\nGeneral and special courts-martial. (a) Authentication by the military judge. In\nspecial courts-martial in which a bad-conduct discharge has been adjudged and\nin general courts-martial, except as provided in clause (b) of this\nsubparagraph, the military judge present at the end of the proceedings\nauthenticates the record of trial, or that portion over which the military\njudge presided. If more than one military judge presided over the proceedings, each military judge authenticates the record of the proceedings over which that\nmilitary judge presided, except as provided in clause ( b) of this\nsubparagraph. The record of trial of special court-martial in which no\nbad-conduct discharge was adjudged is also authenticated by the military judge\nas set forth above. (b) Substitute\nauthentication. If the military judge cannot authenticate the record of trial\nbecause of the military judge's death, disability, or absence, the trial\ncounsel present at the end of the proceedings authenticates the record of\ntrial. If the trial counsel cannot authenticate the record of trial because of\nthe trial counsel's death, disability, or absence, a member authenticates the\nrecord of trial. In a court-martial composed of a military judge alone, or as\nto sessions without members, the court reporter authenticates the record of\ntrial when this duty would fall upon a member under this paragraph. A person\nauthorized to authenticate a record under this paragraph may authenticate the\nrecord only as to those proceedings at which that person was present. (iii)\n\nSummary courts-martial. The\nsummary court-martial authenticates the summary court-martial record of trial\nas prescribed in N.Y.R.C.M. 1305(a). (2)\n(i) Service. (a) Service of record of trial on\naccused. In each general and special court-martial, except as provided in\nclause (c) or (d) of this subparagraph, the trial counsel must cause a copy of\nthe record of trial to be served on the accused as soon as the record of trial\nis authenticated. (b) Proof of\nservice of record of trial on accused. The trial counsel must cause the\naccused's receipt for the copy of the record of trial to be attached to the\noriginal record of trial. If it is impracticable to secure a receipt from the\naccused before the original record of trial is forwarded to the convening\nauthority, the trial counsel must prepare a certificate indicating that a copy\nof the record of trial has been transmitted to the accused, including the means\nof transmission and the address, and cause the certificate to be attached to\nthe original record of trial. In such a case the accused's receipt must be\nforwarded to the convening authority as soon as it is obtained. (c) Substitute service. If it is\nimpracticable to serve the record of trial on the accused because of the\ntransfer of the accused to a distant place, the unauthorized absence of the\naccused, or military exigency, or if the accused so requests on the record at\nthe court-martial or in writing, the accused's copy of the record must be\nforwarded to the accused's defense counsel, if any. Trial counsel must attach a\nstatement to the record explaining why the accused was not served personally. If the accused has more than one counsel, N.Y.R.C.M. 1106(f)(2) applies. If the\naccused has no counsel and if the accused is absent without authority, the\ntrial counsel must prepare an explanation for the failure to serve the record. The explanation and the accused's copy of the record must be forwarded with the\noriginal record. The accused must be provided with a copy of the record as soon\nas practicable. (d) Classified\ninformation. (1)\n\nForwarding to convening\nauthority. If the copy of the record of trial prepared for the accused contains\nclassified information, the trial counsel, unless directed otherwise by the\nconvening authority, must forward the accused's copy to the convening\nauthority, before it is served on the accused. (2)\n\nResponsibility of the convening\nauthority. The convening authority must: (i) cause any classified information to be deleted or withdrawn from the accused's\ncopy or the record of trial; (ii)\ncause a certificate indicating that classified information has been deleted or\nwithdrawn to be attached to the record of trial; and\n(iii)\ncause the expurgated copy of the record\nof trial and the attached certificate regarding classified information to be\nserved on the accused as provided in clauses (a) and (b) of this subparagraph\nexcept that the accused's receipt must show that the accused has received an\nexpurgated copy of the record of trial. (3)\n\nContents of certificate. The certificate\nregarding deleted or withdrawn classified information must indicate: (i) that the original record of trial may be\ninspected in the files of the Adjutant General under such conditions as may\ndirected by the Chief of Staff to the Governor; (ii)\nthe pages of the record of trial from\nwhich matter has been deleted; (iii)\nthe pages of the record of trial which\nhave been entirely deleted; and\n(iv)\nthe exhibits which have been\nwithdrawn. (ii)\n\nSummary courts-martial. The summary\ncourt-martial record of trial is disposed of as provided in N.Y.R.C.M. 1305(e). Clause (d) of this paragraph applies if classified information is included in\nthe record of trial of a summary court-martial. (3)\n\nLoss of record. If the authenticated\nrecord of trial is lost or destroyed, the trial counsel must, if practicable, cause another record of trial to be prepared for authentication. The new record\nof trial becomes the record of trial in the case if the requirements of\nN.Y.R.C.M. 1103 and this subdivision are met. (4)\n\nCorrection of record after\nauthentication; certificate of correction. (i) In general. A record of trial found to be\nincomplete or defective after authentication may be corrected to make it\naccurate. A record of trial may be returned to the convening authority by\nsuperior competent authority for correction under this subdivision. (ii)\n\nProcedure. An authenticated record of\ntrial believed to be incomplete or defective may be returned to the military\njudge or summary court-martial for a certificate of correction. The military\njudge or summary court-martial must give notice of the proposed correction to\nall parties and permit them to examine and respond to the proposed correction\nbefore authenticating the certificate of correction. All parties must be given\nreasonable access to any original reporter's notes or tapes of the\nproceedings. (iii)\n\nAuthentication\nof certificate of correction; service on the accused. The certificate of\ncorrection must be authenticated as provided in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision and a copy served on the accused as provided in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision. The certificate of correction and the accused's receipt for\nthe certificate of correction must be attached to each copy of the record of\ntrial required to be prepared under N.Y.R.C.M. 1103(g). (5)\n\nForwarding. After every court-martial, including a rehearing and new and other trials, the authenticated record must\nbe forwarded to the convening authority for initial review and action, provided\nthat in case of a special court-martial in which a bad-conduct discharge was\nadjudged or any court-martial in which confinement at hard labor was adjudged\nor a general court-martial, the convening authority must refer the record to\nthe staff judge advocate or legal officer for a recommendation under N.Y.R.C.M. 1106 before the convening authority takes action (ML, 130.60[d]). (e) Matters submitted by the\naccused. (1)\n\nIn general. After a sentence is\nadjudged in any court-martial, the accused may submit matters to the convening\nauthority in accordance with this subdivision (ML, 130.60). (2)\n\nMatters which may be submitted. The\naccused may submit to the convening authority any written matters which may\nreasonably tend to affect the convening authority's decision whether to\ndisapprove any findings of guilty or to approve the sentence. Such matters are\nnot subject to the Military Rules of Evidence and may include: (i) allegations of errors affecting the\nlegality of the findings or sentence; (ii)\nportions or summaries of the record and\ncopies of documentary evidence offered or introduced at trial; (iii)\nmatters in mitigation which were not\navailable for consideration at the court-martial; and\n(iv)\nclemency recommendations by any member, the military judge, or any other person. The defense may ask any person for\nsuch a recommendation. (3)\n\nTime periods. (i) General courts-martial and special\ncourts-martial in which a bad-conduct discharge was adjudged. After a general\ncourt-martial or after a special court-martial in which a bad-conduct discharge\nwas adjudged, the accused may submit matters under this subdivision within 30\ndays after the sentence was announced or within seven days after a copy of the\nrecord of trial is served on the accused under N.Y.R.C.M. 1104(b)(1), whichever\nis later. The convening authority may, for good cause, extend the 30-day period\nfor not more than 20 additional days or the seven-day period for not more than\n10 additional days. (ii)\n\nOther\nspecial courts-martial. After a special court-martial in which a bad-conduct\ndischarge was not adjudged, the accused may submit matters under this\nsubdivision within 20 days after the sentence is announced or within seven days\nafter a copy of the record of trial is served on the accused under N.Y.R.C.M. 1104(b)(1), whichever is later. The convening authority may, for good cause, extend either period for not more than 10 additional days. (iii)\n\nSummary courts-martial. After a summary\ncourt-martial the accused may submit matters under this subdivision within\nseven days after the sentence is announced. The convening authority, for good\ncause, may extend this period for not more than 10 additional days. (iv)\n\nPost-trail sessions. A post-trial\nsession under N.Y.R.C.M. 1102 has no effect on the running of any time period\nin this subdivision, except when such session results in the announcement of a\nnew sentence, in which case the period runs from that announcement. (v) Good cause. For purposes of this\nsubdivision, good cause for an extension ordinarily does not include the need\nfor securing matters which could reasonably have been presented at the\ncourt-martial. (4)\n\nWaiver. (i) Failure to submit matters. Failure to submit matters within the time prescribed by this subdivision is a\nwaiver of the right to submit such matters. (ii)\n\nSubmission of matters. Submission of any\nmatters under this subdivision is a waiver of the right to submit additional\nmatters unless the right to submit additional matters within the prescribed\ntime limits is expressly reserved in writing. (iii)\n\nWritten waiver. The accused may\nexpressly waive, in writing, the right to submit matters under this\nsubdivision. Once filed, such waiver may not be revoked (ML, 130.60[b][4]). (iv)\n\nAbsence of the\naccused. If, as a result of the unauthorized absence of the accused, the record\ncannot be served on the accused in accordance with N.Y.R.C.M. 1104(b)(1) and if\nthe accused has no counsel to receive the record, the accused is deemed to have\nwaived the right to submit matters under this subdivision within the time limit\nwhich begins upon service on the accused of the record of trial. (f) Recommendation of\nthe staff judge advocate or legal officer. (1)\n\nIn general. Before the convening authority takes action under N.Y.R.C.M. 1107\non a record of trial by general court-martial or a record of trial by special\ncourt-martial which includes a sentence to a bad-conduct discharge or any\ncourt-martial in which confinement of hard labor, that convening authority's\nstaff judge advocate or legal officer must, except as provided in paragraph (3)\nof this subdivision, forward to the convening authority a recommendation under\nthis subdivision (ML, 130.60[d]). (2)\n\nDisqualification. No person who has acted\nas member, military judge, trial counsel, assistant trial counsel, defense\ncounsel, associate or assistant defense counsel, or investigating officer in\nany case may later act as a staff judge advocate or legal officer or any\nreviewing or convening authority in the same case. (3)\n\nWhen the convening authority has no staff\njudge advocate. (i) When the convening\nauthority does not have a staff judge advocate or legal officer or that person\nis disqualified. If the convening authority does not have a staff judge\nadvocate or legal officer, or if the person serving in that capacity is\ndisqualified under paragraph (2) of this subdivision or otherwise, the\nconvening authority must: (a) request the\nassignment of another staff judge advocate or legal officer to prepare a\nrecommendation under this subdivision; or\n(b) forward the record for action to any\nofficer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction as provided in N.Y.R.C.M. 1107(a). (ii)\n\nWhen the\nconvening authority has a legal officer but wants the recommendation of a staff\njudge advocate. If the convening authority has a legal officer but no staff\njudge advocate, the convening authority may, as a matter of discretion, request\ndesignation of a staff judge advocate to prepare the recommendation. (4)\n\nForm and content of\nrecommendation. (i) In general. The purpose\nof the recommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer is to assist\nthe convening authority to decide what action to take on the sentence in the\nexercise of command prerogative. The staff judge advocate or legal officer must\nuse the record of trial in the preparation of the recommendation. (ii)\n\nForm. The recommendation of the staff\njudge advocate or legal officer must be a concise written\ncommunication. (iii)\n\nRequired\ncontents. Except as provided in paragraph (5) of this subdivision, the\nrecommendation of the staff judge advocate or legal officer must include\nconcise information as to: (a) the findings\nand sentence adjudged by the court-martial; (b) a summary of the accused's service\nrecord, to include length and character of service, awards and decorations\nreceived, and any records of non-judicial punishment and previous\nconvictions; (c) a statement of the\nnature and duration of any pretrial restraint; (d) if there is a pretrial agreement, a\nstatement of any action the convening authority is obligated to take under the\nagreement or a statement of the reasons why the convening authority is not\nobligated to take specific action under the agreement; and\n(e) a specific recommendation as to the\naction to be taken by the convening authority on the sentence. (iv)\n\nLegal errors. The staff judge\nadvocate or legal officer is not required to examine the record for legal\nerrors. However, when the recommendation is prepared by a staff judge advocate, the staff judge advocate must state whether, in the staff judge advocate's\nopinion, corrective action on the findings or sentence should be taken when an\nallegation of legal error is raised in matters submitted under N.Y.R.C.M. 1105\nor when otherwise deemed appropriate by the staff judge advocate. The response\nmay consist of a statement of agreement or disagreement with the matter raised\nby the accused. An analysis or rationale for the staff judge advocate's\nstatement, if any, concerning legal errors is not required. (v) Optional matters. The recommendation of\nthe staff judge advocate or legal officer may include, in addition to matters\nincluded under subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph, any additional\nmatters deemed appropriate by the staff judge advocate or legal officer. Such\nmatters may include matters outside the record. (vi)\n\nEffect of error. In case of error in the\nrecommendation not otherwise waived under subparagraph (6)(vi) of this\nsubdivision, appropriate corrective action must be taken by appellate\nauthorities without returning the case for further action by a convening\nauthority. (5)\n\nNo\nfindings of guilty. If the proceedings resulted in an acquittal of all charges\nand specifications or if, after the trial began, the proceedings were\nterminated without findings and no further action is contemplated, a\nrecommendation under this subdivision is not required. (6)\n\nService of recommendation on defense\ncounsel; defense response. (i) Service of\nrecommendation on defense counsel. Before forwarding the recommendation and the\nrecord of trial to the convening authority for action under N.Y.R.C.M. 1107, the staff judge advocate or legal officer must cause a copy of the\nrecommendation to be served on counsel for the accused (ML, 130.60\n[d]). (ii)\n\nCounsel for the accused. The accused may, at trial or in writing to the staff judge advocate or legal\nofficer before the recommendation has been served under this subdivision, designate which counsel (detailed, individual military, or civilian) will be\nserved with the recommendation. In the absence of such designation, the staff\njudge advocate or legal officer must cause the recommendation to be served in\nthe following order of precedence, as applicable, on: (a) civilian counsel; (b) individual military counsel; or\n(c) detailed defense counsel. If\nthe accused has not retained civilian counsel and the detailed defense counsel\nand individual military counsel, if any, have been relieved or are not\nreasonably available to represent the accused, substitute military counsel to\nrepresent the accused must be detailed by an appropriate authority. Substitute\ncounsel must enter into an attorney-client relationship with the accused before\nexamining the recommendation and preparing any response. (iii)\n\nRecord of trial. The staff judge\nadvocate or legal officer must, upon request of counsel for the accused served\nwith the recommendation, provide that counsel with a copy of the record of\ntrial for use while preparing the response to the recommendation. (iv)\n\nResponse. Counsel for the accused may\nsubmit, in writing, corrections or rebuttal to any matter in the recommendation\nbelieved to erroneous, inadequate, or misleading, and may comment on any other\nmatter. (v) Time period. Counsel\nfor the accused has five days from receipt in which to submit comments on the\nrecommendation. The convening authority may, for good cause, extend the period\nin which comments may be submitted for up to 20 additional days (ML, 130.60[d]). (vi)\n\nWaiver. Failure of\ncounsel for the accused to comment on any matter in the recommendation or\nmatters attached to the recommendation in a timely manner waives later claim of\nerror with regard to such matter in the absence of plain error. (vii)\n\nNew matter in addendum to\nrecommendation. The staff judge advocate or legal officer may supplement the\nrecommendation after counsel for the accused has been served with the\nrecommendation and given an opportunity to comment. When new matter is\nintroduced after counsel for the accused has examined the recommendation, however, counsel for the accused must be served with the new matter and given a\nfurther opportunity to comment. (g) Action by convening authority. (1)\n\nWho may take action. The convening\nauthority must take action on the sentence and, in the discretion of the\nconvening authority, the findings, unless it is impracticable. If it is\nimpracticable for the convening authority to act, the convening authority must\nforward the case to an officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction\nwho may take action under this subdivision. (2)\n\nGeneral considerations. (i) Discretion of convening authority. The\naction to be taken on the findings and sentence is within the sole discretion\nof the convening authority. Determining what action to take on the findings and\nsentence of a court-martial is a matter of command prerogative. The convening\nauthority is not required to review the case for legal errors or factual\nsufficiency (ML, 130.60[c]). (ii)\n\nWhen action may be taken. The convening authority may take action only after\nthe applicable time periods under N.Y.R.C.M. 1105(c) have expired or the\naccused has waived the right to present matters under N.Y.R.C.M. 1105(d), whichever is earlier. (iii)\n\nMatters\nconsidered. (a) Required matters. Before\ntaking action, the convening authority must consider: (1)\nthe result of trial; (2)\nthe recommendation of the staff judge\nadvocate or legal officer under N.Y.R.C.M. 1106, if applicable; and\n(3)\nany matters submitted by the accused\nunder N.Y.R.C.M. 1105 or, if applicable, N.Y.R.C.M. 1106(f). (b) Additional matters. Before\ntaking action the convening authority may consider: (1)\nthe record of trial; (2)\nthe personnel records of the accused; and\n(3)\nsuch other matters as the\nconvening authority deems appropriate. However, if the convening authority\nconsiders matters adverse to the accused from outside the record, with\nknowledge of which the accused is not chargeable, the accused must be notified\nand given an opportunity to rebut. (iv)\n\nWhen proceedings resulted in a finding\nof not guilty or there was a ruling amounting to a finding of not guilty. The\nconvening authority cannot take any action approving or disapproving a finding\nof not guilty or a ruling amounting to a finding of not guilty. (v) Action when accused lacks mental\ncapacity. The convening authority may not approve a sentence while the accused\nlacks mental capacity to understand and to conduct or cooperate intelligently\nin the post-trial proceedings. In the absence of substantial evidence to the\ncontrary, the accused is presumed to have the capacity to understand and to\nconduct or cooperate intelligently in the post-trial proceedings. If a\nsubstantial question is raised as to the requisite mental capacity of the\naccused, the convening authority may direct an examination of the accused in\naccordance with N.Y.R.C.M. 706 before deciding whether the accused lacks mental\ncapacity, the examination may be limited to determining the accused's present\ncapacity to understand and cooperate in the post-trial proceedings. The\nconvening authority may approve the sentence unless it is established, by a\nprepondarance of the evidence--including matters outside the record of\ntrial--that the accused does not have the requisite mental capacity. Nothing in\nthis paragraph prohibits the convening authority from disapproving the findings\nof guilty and sentence. (3)\n\nAction on findings. Action on the\nfindings is not required. However, the convening authority may, in the\nconvening authority's sole discretion: (i) Change a finding of guilty to a charge or specification to a finding of guilty\nto an offense that is a lesser included offense of the offense stated in the\ncharge or specification; or\n(ii)\n\nSet aside any finding of guilty and: (a) dismiss the specification and, if appropriate, the charge; or\n(b) direct a rehearing in accordance with\nparagraph (5) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nAction on the sentence. (i) In general. The convening authority may\nfor any or no reason disapprove a legal sentence in whole or in part, mitigate\nthe sentence, and change a punishment to one of a different nature as long as\nthe severity of the punishment is not increased. The convening or higher\nauthority may not increase the punishment imposed by a court-martial. The\napproval or disapproval must be explicitly stated. (ii)\n\nDetermining what sentence should be\napproved. The convening authority must approve that sentence which is warranted\nby the circumstances of the offense and appropriate for the accused. When the\ncourt-martial has adjudged a mandatory punishment, the convening authority may\nnevertheless approve a lesser sentence. (iii)\n\nLimitations on sentence based on record\nof trial. If the record of trial does not meet the requirements of N.Y.R.C.M. 1103(b)(2)(B) or (c)(1), the convening authority may not approve a sentence in\nexcess of that which may be adjudged by a special court-martial, or one which\nincludes a bad-conduct discharge. (5)\n\nOrdering rehearing or other trial. (i) Rehearing. (a) In general. Subject to clause (b) through\n(e) of this subparagraph, the convening authority may in the convening\nauthority's discretion order a rehearing. A rehearing may be ordered as to some\nor all offenses of which findings of guilty were entered and the sentence, or\nas to sentence only (ML, 130.60[e]). (b) When the convening authority may order a\nrehearing. The convening authority may order a rehearing: (1)\nwhen taking action on the court-martial\nunder this subdivision; (2)\nin\ncases subject to review by the Board of Military Review, before the case is\nforwarded under N.Y.R.C.M. 1111(a)(1) or (b)(1), but only as to any sentence\nwhich was approved or findings of guilty which were not disapproved in any\nearlier action. In such a case, a supplemental action disapproving the sentence\nand some or all of the findings, as appropriate, must be taken; or\n(3)\nwhen authorized to do so by superior\ncompetent authority. If the convening authority finds a rehearing as to any\noffenses impracticable the convening authority may dismiss those specifications\nand, when appropriate, charges. (c) Limitations. (1)\n\nSentence approved. A rehearing cannot be\nordered if, in the same action, a sentence is approved. (2)\n\nLack of sufficient evidence. A rehearing\ncannot be ordered as to findings of guilty when there is a lack of sufficient\nevidence in the record to support the findings of guilty of the offense charged\nor of any lesser included offense. A rehearing may be ordered, however, if the\nproof of guilt consisted of inadmissible evidence for which there is available\nan admissible substitute. A rehearing may be ordered as to any lesser offense\nincluded in an offense of which the accused was found guilty, provided there is\nsufficient evidence in the record to support the lesser included\noffense. (3)\n\nRehearing on sentence\nonly. A rehearing on sentence only cannot be referred to a different kind of\ncourt-martial from that which made the original findings. (d) Additional charges. Additional charges\nmay be referred for trial together with charges as to which a rehearing has\nbeen directed. (e) Lesser included\noffenses. If at a previous trial the accused was convicted of a lesser included\noffense, a rehearing may be ordered only as to that included offense or as to\nan offense included in that found. If, however, a rehearing is ordered\nimproperly on the original offense charged and the accused is convicted of that\noffense at the rehearing, the finding as to the lesser included offense of\nwhich the accused was convicted at the original trial may nevertheless be\napproved. (ii)\n\"Other\"\ntrial. The convening or higher authority may order an \"other\" trial if the\noriginal proceedings were invalid because of lack of jurisdiction or failure of\na specification to state an offense. The authority ordering an \"other\" trial\nmust state in the action the basis for declaring the proceedings\ninvalid. (6)\n\nContents of\naction and related matters. (i) In general. The convening authority must state in writing the convening authority's\ndecision as to the sentence, whether any findings of guilty are disapproved, and orders as to further disposition. The action must be signed personally by\nthe convening authority. The convening authority's authority to sign must\nappear below the signature. (ii)\n\nModification of initial action. The convening authority may recall and modify\nany action taken by that convening authority at any time before it has been\npublished or before the accused has been officially notified. In addition, in\nany special court-martial not involving a bad-conduct discharge or any summary\ncourt-martial, the convening authority may recall and correct an illegal, erroneous, incomplete, or ambiguous action at any time before completion of\nreview under N.Y.R.C.M. 1112, as long as the correction does not result in\naction less favorable to the accused than the earlier action. When so directed\nby a higher reviewing authority or the State judge advocate, the convening\nauthority must modify any incomplete, ambiguous, void, or inaccurate action\nnoted in review of the record of trial under ML, 130.63, 130.65, or 130.66 or\nexamination of the record of trial under ML, 130.68. The convening authority\nmust personally sign any supplementary or corrective action. (iii)\n\nFindings of guilty. If any findings of\nguilty are disapproved, the action must so state. If a rehearing is not\nordered, the affected charges and specifications must be dismissed by the\nconvening authority in the action. If a rehearing or other trial is directed, the reasons for the disapproval must be set forth in the action. (iv)\n\nAction on sentence. (a) In general. The action must state whether\nthe sentence adjudged by the court-martial is approved. If only part of the\nsentence is approved, the action must state which parts are approved. A\nrehearing may not be directed if any sentence is approved. (b) Execution; suspension. The action must\nindicate, when appropriate, whether an approved sentence is to be executed or\nwhether the execution of all or any part of the sentence is to be suspended. No\nreasons need be stated. (c) Place\nof confinement. If the accused waives his right to appellate review or\nwithdraws an appeal under N.Y.R.C.M. 1110 and if the convening authority orders\na sentence of confinement at hard labor into execution, the convening authority\nmust designate the place of confinement in the action. If the accused does not\nso waive or withdraw and if a sentence of confinement is ordered into execution\nafter the initial action of the convening authority, the authority ordering the\nexecution must designate the place of confinement (ML, 130.69). (d) Deferment of service of sentence to\nconfinement. Whenever the service of the sentence to confinement is deferred by\nthe convening authority under N.Y.R.C.M. 1101(c) before or concurrently with\nthe initial action in the case, the action must include the date on which the\ndeferment became effective. The reason for the deferment need not be stated in\nthe action. (e) Credit for illegal\npretrial confinement. When the military judge has directed that the accused\nreceive credit under N.Y.R.C.M. 305(k), the convening authority must so direct\nin the action. (f) Reprimand. The\nconvening authority must include in the action any reprimand which the\nconvening authority has ordered executed. (v) Action on rehearing or new or other\ntrial. (a) Rehearing or other trial. In\nacting on a rehearing or other trial the convening authority is subject to the\nsentence limitations prescribed in N.Y.R.C.M. 810(d). Except when a rehearing\nor other trial is combined with a trial on additional offenses and except as\notherwise provided in N.Y.R.C.M. 810(d), if any part of the original sentence\nwas suspended and the suspension was not properly vacated before the order\ndirecting the rehearing, the convening authority must take the necessary\nsuspension action to prevent an increase in the same type of punishment as was\npreviously suspended. The convening authority may approve a sentence adjudged\nupon a rehearing or other trial regardless of whether any kind or amount of the\npunishment adjudged at the former trial has been served or executed. However, in computing the term or amount or punishment to be actually served or executed\nunder the new sentence, the accused must be credited with any kind or amount of\nthe former sentence included within the new sentence that was served or\nexecuted before the time it was disapproved or set aside. The convening\nauthority must, if any part of a sentence adjudged upon a rehearing or other\ntrial is approved, direct in the action that any part or amount of the former\nsentence served or executed between the date it was adjudged and the date it\nwas disapproved or set aside must be credited to the accused. If, in the action\non the record of a rehearing, the convening authority disapproves the findings\nof guilty of all charges and specification which were tried at the former\nhearing and that part of the sentence which was based on these findings, the\nconvening authority must, unless a further rehearing is ordered, provide in the\naction that all rights, privileges, and property affected by any executed\nportion of the sentence adjudged at the former hearing must be restored. The\nconvening authority must take the same restorative action if a court-martial at\na rehearing acquits the accused of all charges and specifications which were\ntried at the former hearing. (b) New trial. The action of the convening authority on a new trial must insofar as\npracticable, conform to the rules prescribed for rehearings and other trials in\nclause (a) of this subparagraph. (7)\n\nIncomplete, ambiguous, or erroneous\naction. When the action of the convening or of a higher authority is\nincomplete, ambiguous, or contains clerical error, the authority who took the\nincomplete, ambiguous, or erroneous action may be instructed by an authority\nacting under ML, 130.63, 130.65, and 130.68 to withdraw the original action and\nsubstitute a corrected action. (8)\n\nService on accused. A copy of the convening authority's action must be served\non the accused or on defense counsel. If the action is served on defense\ncounsel, defense counsel must, by expeditious means, provide the accused with a\ncopy. (h) Suspension of\nexecution of sentence; remission. (1)\n\nIn\ngeneral. Suspension of a sentence grants the accused a probationary period\nduring which the suspended part of an approved sentence is not executed, and\nupon the accused's successful completion of which the suspended part of the\nsentence is remitted. Remission cancels the unexecuted part of a sentence to\nwhich it applies. (2)\n\nWho may\nsuspend and remit. The Chief of Staff to the Governor and, when designated by\nhim the Vice Chief of Staff to the Governor, Adjutant General, State judge\nadvocate, or commanding officer may remit or suspend any part or amount of the\nunexpired part of any sentence, including all uncollected forfeitures other\nthan a sentence approved by the Governor (ML, 130.72[a]). (3)\n\nConditions of suspension. The authority\nwho suspends the execution of the sentence of a court-martial must: (i) specify in writing the conditions of the\nsuspension; (ii)\ncause a copy of\nthe conditions of the suspension to be served on the probationer; and\n(iii)\ncause a receipt to be secured from the\nprobationer for service of the conditions of the suspension. Unless otherwise stated, an action suspending a sentence\nincludes as a condition that the probationer not violate any punitive article\nof the code. (4)\n\nLimitations on suspension. (i) In general. Suspension must be for a stated period of time until the occurrence of an\nanticipated future event. The period cannot be unreasonably long. The convening\nauthority must provide in the action that unless the suspension is sooner\nvacated, the expiration of the period of suspension remits the suspended\nportion of the sentence. An appropriate authority may, before the expiration of\nthe period of suspension, remit any part of the sentence, including a part\nwhich has been suspended; reduce the period of suspension; or, subject to\nN.Y.R.C.M. 1109, vacate the suspension in whole or in part. (ii)\n\nSuspending the execution of forfeiture. If a sentence includes a forfeiture in addition to confinement not suspended, such forfeiture may apply to pay or allowances accruing to the accused on and\nafter the date the convening authority approves such a sentence and to any pay\nor allowances accrued before such date, unless the convening authority, at the\ntime he approves the sentence, suspends the execution of that portion of the\nsentence pertaining to forfeitures (see ML, 130.57[a]). However, in a case\ninvolving an approved sentence of confinement and forfeiture if the convening\nauthority does not desire to suspend the execution of the confinement or the\nforfeiture, but determines that the circumstances of the case warrant\ncontinuation of the accused in a pay status pending completion of appellate\nreview, he may provide in his action that the application of the forfeiture\nshall be deferred until such time as the sentence as a whole is carried into\nexecution. When the approved sentence includes a forfeiture in addition to\nconfinement not suspended, the convening authority, unless he orders the\nexecution, suspends the execution, or defers the applicability of the\nforfeitures, should include in his action on the case a statement that the\napproved forfeiture will apply to pay or allowances accruing to the accused on\nand after a certain date (naming the date) see Appendix L-2(A11), modified as\nabove set forth. This statement will aid disbursing and personnel officers in\ndetermining the effect of the approval by the convening authority of a sentence\nwhich includes a forfeiture. (5)\n\nTermination of suspension by remission. Expiration of the period provided in the action suspending a sentence or part\nof a sentence remits the suspended portion unless the suspension is sooner\nvacated. Death or separation which terminates status as a person subject to the\ncode results in remission of the suspended portion of the sentence. (i) Vacation of suspension of\nsentence. (1)\n\nIn general. Suspension of\nexecution of the sentence of a court-martial may be vacated for violation of\nthe conditions of the suspension provided in this subdivision (ML, 130.70). (2)\n\nTimeliness. (i) Violation of conditions. Vacation must be\nbased on a violation of the conditions of suspension which occurs within the\nperiod of suspension. (ii)\n\nVacation\nproceedings. Vacation proceedings under this subdivision must be completed\nwithin a reasonable time. (iii)\n\nOrder vacating the suspension. The order vacating the suspension must be issued\nbefore the expiration of the period of suspension. (iv)\n\nInterruptions to the period of\nsuspension. Unauthorized absence of the probationer or the commencement of\nproceedings under this subdivision to vacate suspension interrupts the running\nof the period of suspension. (3)\n\nConfinement of probationer pending\nvacation proceedings. (i) In general. A\nprobationer under a suspended sentence to confinement may be confined pending\naction under subparagraph (4)(ii) of this subdivision in accordance with the\nprocedures in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nWho may order confinement. Any person\nwho may order confinement under N.Y.R.C.M. 304(b) may order confinement of a\nprohationer under a suspended sentence to confinement. (iii)\n\nBasis for confinement. A probationer\nunder a suspended sentence to confinement may be ordered into confinement upon\nprobable cause to believe the probationer violated any conditions of the\nsuspension. (iv)\n\nReview of\nconfinement. Unless proceedings under subparagraph (4)(i) or paragraph (5) of\nthis subdivision are completed within seven days of imposition of confinement\nof the probationer (not including any delays requested by probationer), a\npreliminary hearing must be conducted by a neutral and detached officer\nappointed in accordance with these regulations. (a) Rights of accused. Before the preliminary\nhearing, the accused shall be notified in writing of: (1)\nthe time, place, and purpose of the\nhearing, including the alleged violation(s) of the conditions of\nsuspension; (2)\nthe right to be\npresent at the hearing; (3)\nthe\nright to be represented at the hearing by civilian counsel provided by the\nprobationer or, upon request, by military counsel detailed for this purpose; and\n(4)\nthe opportunity to be\nheard, to present witnesses who are reasonably available and other evidence, and the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses unless the\nhearing officer determines that this would subject these witnesses to risk or\nharm. For purposes of this paragraph, a witness is not reasonably available if\nthe witness requires reimbursement by the State for any cost incurred in\nappearing, cannot appear without unduly delaying the proceedings, or, if a\nmilitary witness, cannot be excused from other important duties. (b) Rules of evidence. Except for\n\nMil. R. Evid. section V (Privileges) and Mil. R. Evid. 302 and 305, the\n\nMilitary Rules of Evidence do not apply to matters considered at the\npreliminary hearing under this subdivision. (c) Decision. The hearing officer must\ndetermine whether there is probable cause to believe that the probationer\nviolated the conditions of the probationer's suspension. If the hearing officer\ndetermines that probable cause is lacking, the hearing officer must, in\nwriting, order the probationer released from confinement. If the hearing\nofficer determines that there is probable cause to believe that the probationer\nviolated the conditions of suspension, the hearing officer must set forth in a\nwritten memorandum the decision, the reasons for the decision, and the\ninformation relied on. The hearing officer must forward the original memorandum\nor release order to the probationer's commander and forward a copy to the\nprobationer and the officer in charge of the confinement facility. (4)\n\nVacation of\nsuspended general court-martial sentence or of a suspended special\ncourt-martial sentence including a bad-conduct discharge or of any\ncourt-martial which, as approved, includes confinement at hard labor. (i) Action by officer having special\ncourt-martial jurisdiction over probationer. (a) In general. Before vacation of the\nsuspension of any general court-martial sentence, or of a special court-martial\nsentence which, as approved, includes a bad-conduct discharge, or of any\ncourt-martial which, as approved, includes confinement at hard labor, the\nofficer having special court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer must\npersonally hold a hearing on the alleged violation of the conditions of\nprobation. If there is no officer having special court-martial jurisdiction\nover the accused who is subordinate to the officer having general court-martial\njurisdiction over the accused, the officer exercising general court-martial\njurisdiction over the accused must personally hold the hearing under this\nsubparagraph. In such cases clause (d) of this subparagraph shall not\napply. (b) Notice to probationer. Before the hearing the authority conducting the hearing must cause the\nprobationer to be notified of: (1)\nthe time, place, and purpose, of the hearing; (2)\nthe right to be present at the\nhearing; (3)\nthe alleged violations\nof the conditions of probation and the evidence expected to be relied\non; (4)\nthe right to be represented\nat the hearing by civilian counsel provided by the probationer or, upon\nrequest, by military counsel detailed for this purpose; and\n(5)\nthe opportunity to be heard, to present\nwitnesses and other evidence, and the right to confront and cross-examine\nadverse witnesses unless the hearing officer determines that there is good\ncause for not allowing confrontation and cross-examination. (c) Hearing. The procedure for the\nvacation hearing must follow that prescribed in N.Y.R.C.M. 405(g), (h)(1), and\n(i). (d) Record; recommendation. The officer who conducts the vacation proceeding must make a summarized record\nof the proceeding and forward the record and that officer's recommendation\nconcerning vacation to the officer exercising general court-martial\njurisdiction over the probationer. (e) Release from confinement. If the special\ncourt-martial convening authority finds there is not probable cause to believe\nthat the probationer violated the conditions of the suspension, the special\ncourt-martial convening authority must order the release of the probationer\nfrom any confinement ordered under paragraph (3) of this subdivision. The\nspecial court-martial convening authority must, in any event, forward the\nrecord and recommendation under clause (d) of this subparagraph. (ii)\n\nAction by officer exercising\ngeneral court-martial jurisdiction over probationer. (a) In general. The officer exercising\ngeneral court-martial jurisdiction over the probationer must, based upon the\nrecord produced by and the recommendation of the officer exercising special\ncourt-martial jurisdiction over the probationer, decide whether the probationer\nviolated a condition of suspension, and, if so, whether to vacate the suspended\nsentence. If the officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction decides\nto vacate, that officer must prepare a written statement of the evidence relied\non and the reasons for vacating. (b) Execution. Any unexecuted part of a\nsuspended sentence ordered vacated under this subdivision must, subject to\nN.Y.R.C.M. 1113(C), be ordered executed. (5)\n\nVacation of a suspended special\ncourt-martial sentence not including a bad-conduct discharge or confinement at\nhard labor or of a suspended summary court-martial sentence not including\nconfinement at hard labor. (i) In general. Before vacation of the suspension of a special court-martial sentence not\nincluding a bad-conduct discharge, confinement at hard labor or of a summary\ncourt-martial sentence not including confinement at hard labor, the officer\nhaving authority to convene for the command in which the probationer is serving\nor assigned the same kind of court-martial which imposed the sentence must\ncause a hearing to be held on the alleged violation(s) of the conditions of\nsuspension. (ii)\n\nNotice to\nprobationer. The person conducting the hearing must notify the probationer\nbefore the hearing of the rights specified in subclauses (4)(i)(b) (1),(2),(3)\nand (4) of this subdivision. The authority conducting the hearing must also\nnotify the probationer that the probationer has the right to civilian counsel\nprovided by the probationer or, upon request counsel detailed for that purpose, if the probationer was entitled to such counsel under N.Y.R.C.M. 506(a) at the\ncourt-martial which imposed the sentence. (iii)\n\nHearing. The procedure for the vacation\nhearing must follow that prescribed in N.Y.R.C.M. 405(g), (h)(1), and\n(i). (iv)\n\nRecord; recommendation. If the hearing is not held by the commander with authority to vacate the\nsuspension, the person who conducts the vacation proceeding must make a\nsummarized record of the proceeding and forward the record and that officer's\nwritten recommendation concerning vacation to the commander with authority to\nvacate the suspension. (v) Decision.

(6)\n\nAction by officer exercising general\ncourt-martial jurisdiction. (i) Action. The\nofficer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction who receives a record\nunder paragraph (5) of this subdivision may: (a) disapprove or approve the findings or\nsentence in whole or in part; (b) remit, commute, or suspend the sentence in whole or in part; (c) except where the evidence was\ninsufficient at the trial to support the findings, order a rehearing on the\nfindings, on the sentence, or on both; or\n(d) dismiss the charges.

(7)\n\nForwarding following review under this\nsubdivision. (i) Records forwarded to the\n\nState judge advocate. If the judge advocate who reviews the case under this\nsubdivision states that corrective action is required as a matter of law, and\nthe officer exercising general court-martial jurisdiction does not take action\nthat is at least as favorable to the accused as that recommended by the judge\nadvocate, the record of trial and the action thereon must be forwarded to the\n\nState judge advocate for review under N.Y.R.C.M. 1201(b)(2). (ii)\n\nSentence including dismissal. If the\napproved sentence includes dismissal, the record must be forwarded to the Chief\nof Staff to the Governor (see ML, 130.69[a]). (iii)\n\nOther records. Records reviewed under\nthis subdivision which are not forwarded under subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph be disposed of as prescribed by regulations. (m) Execution of sentences. (1)\n\nIn general. No sentence of a\ncourt-martial may be executed unless it has been approved by the convening\nauthority. (2)\n\nPunishments which\nthe convening authority may order executed in the initial action. Except as\nprovided in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, the convening authority may\norder all or part of the sentence of a court-martial executed when the\nconvening authority takes initial action under N.Y.R.C.M. 1107 (see ML, 130.69[b][2]). (3)\n\nPunishments\nwhich the convening authority may not order executed in the initial action. A\ndishonorable or bad-conduct discharge may be ordered executed only by: (i) the officer who reviews the case under\nN.Y.R.C.M. 1112(f), as part of the action approving the sentence, except when\nthat action must be forwarded under N.Y.R.C.M. 1112(g)(1); or\n(ii)\nthe officer then exercising general\ncourt-martial jurisdiction over the accused. A dishonorable or a bad-conduct discharge may be ordered\nexecuted only after a final judgment within the meaning of N.Y.R.C.M. 1207 has\nbeen rendered in the case. If more than six months have elapsed since approval\nof the sentence by the convening authority, before a dishonorable or a\nbad-conduct discharge may be executed, the officer exercising general\ncourt-martial jurisdiction over the accused must consider the advice of that\nofficer's staff judge advocate as to whether retention of the service member\nwould be in the best interest of the service. Such advice must include: the\nfindings and sentence as finally approved; whether the service member has been\non active State duty since the court-martial, and, if so, the nature and\ncharacter of that duty; and a recommendation whether the discharge should be\nexecuted. (4)\n\nOther considerations concerning the execution of certain sentences. (i) Confinement. (a) Effective date of confinement. Any period\nof confinement included in the sentence of a court-martial begins to run from\nthe date the sentence is adjudged by the court-martial, but the following are\nexcluded in computing the service of the term of confinement: (1)\nperiods during which the sentence to\nconfinement is suspended or deferred; (2)\nperiods during which the accused is in\ncustody of civilian authorities under ML, 130.14 from the time of the delivery\nto the return to military custody, if the accused was convicted in the civilian\ncourt; (3)\nperiods during which the\naccused has escaped or is absent without authority, or is absent under a parole\nwhich proper authority has later revoked, or is erroneously released from\nconfinement through misrepresentation or fraud on the part of the prisoner, or\nis erroneously released from confinement upon the prisoner's petition for a\nwrit of habeas corpus under a court order which is later reversed; and\n(4)\nperiods during which\nanother sentence by court-martial to confinement is being served. When a\nprisoner serving a court-martial sentenced to confinement is later convicted by\na court-martial of another offense and sentenced to confinement, the later\nsentence interrupts the running of the earlier sentence. Any unremitted\nremaining portion of the earlier sentence will be served after the later\nsentence is fully executed. (b) Nature of the confinement. The omission\nof \"hard labor\" from any sentence of a court-martial which has adjudged\nconfinement does not prohibit the authority who orders the sentence executed\nfrom requiring hard labor as part of the punishment (ML, 130.58[b]). (c) Place of confinement. The authority who\norders a sentence to confinement into execution must designate the place of\nconfinement. A sentence or confinement is adjudged by a court-martial or other\nmilitary tribunal, regardless of whether the sentence includes a punitive\ndischarge or dismissal has been executed, may be ordered to be served in any\nplace of confinement under the control of any of the forces of the organized\nmilitia or in any jail, penitentiary, or prison designated for that purpose as\nprescribed in ML, 130.11. Persons so confined in such a jail, penitentiary, or\nprison are subject to the same discipline and treatment as persons confined or\ncommitted by the courts of the State or of any political subdivision thereof\n(ML, 130.58[a]). When the service of a sentence to confinement has been\ndeferred and the deferment is later rescinded, the convening authority must\ndesignate the place of confinement in the initial action on the sentence or in\nthe order rescinding the deferment. No member of the organized militia may be\nplaced in confinement in immediate association with enemy prisoners or other\nforeign nationals not members of the organized militia. (ii)\n\nConfinement in lieu of fine. Confinement\nmay not be executed for failure to pay a fine if the accused demonstrates that\nthe accused has made good faith efforts to pay but cannot because of\nindingency, unless the authority considering imposition of confinement\ndetermines, after giving the accused notice and opportunity to be heard, that\nthere is no other punishment adequate to meet the government's interest in\nappropriate punishment. (n) Promulgating order. (1)\n\nIn general. (i) Scope of rule. Orders promulgating the\nresult of trial and the actions of the convening or higher authorities on the\nrecord shall be prepared, issued, and distributed as prescribed in this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nPurpose. A\npromulgating order publishes the result of the court-martial and the convening\nauthority's action and any later action taken on the case. (iii)\n\nSummary courts-martial.

The order\npromulgating the result of trial and the initial action of the convening\nauthority is issued by the convening authority. (ii)\n\nOrders issued after the initial action. Any action taken on the case subsequent to the initial action shall be\npromulgated in supplementary orders. The subsequent action and the\nsupplementary order may be the same document signed personally by the\nappropriate convening or higher authority. (a) When the Governor or the Chief of Staff\nto the Governor has taken final action. General court-martial orders publishing\nthe final result in cases in which the Governor or the Chief of Staff to the\n\nGovernor has taken final action shall be promulgated as prescribed by these\nregulations. (b) Other cases. In\ncases other than those in clause (a) of this subparagraph, the final action may\nbe promulgated by an appropriate convening authority. (3)\n\nContents. (i) In general.

Subsequent actions must recite, verbatim, the action or order of the\nappropriate authority, or a summary thereof. (ii)\n\nDates. A promulgating order must bear\nthe date of the initial action, if any, of the convening authority. An order\npromulgating an acquittal, a court-martial terminated before findings, or\naction on the findings or sentence taken after the initial action of the\nconvening authority must bear the date of its publication.
