Tit. 10 § 80.13 - Minimum security standards for nonpractitioner handling; schedule i and ii controlled substances\n\nState Regulations\n\nSchedule I and II raw materials, bulk materials awaiting further processing, and finished products shall be stored in one of the following secure storage areas: (a) Where small quantities permit, in a safe of GSA class 5 rated or equivalent. If the safe weighs less than 750 pounds it shall be bolted or cemented to the floor or wall in such a way that it cannot readily be removed. The safe shall, where required by the commissioner, be equipped with tamper-proof closed circuit alarm system approved by Underwriter's Laboratories, which when unauthorized entry is attempted, transmits a signal directly to a central protection company, a local police agency which has a legal duty to respond or a 24-hour control station operated by the registrant. (b) A vault constructed or under construction before April 1, 1973 and approved by the commissioner which is of substantial construction with a steel door, combination or key lock and an alarm system. (c) A vault constructed on or after April 1, 1973 which meets the following specifications or their equivalent as determined by the commissioner: (1)\n\nWalls, floors and ceilings constructed of at least eight inches of reinforced concrete or other substantial masonry, reinforced vertically and horizontally with one-half inch steel rods tied six inches on center, or the structural equivalent to such reinforced walls, floors and ceilings. (2)\n\nThe door of the vault shall contain a multiple-position combination lock or the equivalent, a relocking device or equivalent and steel plate with a thickness of at least one-half inch. (The GSA class 5 rated steel door meets all of the qualifications for the vault door.)\n(3)\n\nThe vault, if operations require it to remain open for frequent access shall be equipped with a \"day gate\" or the equivalent, which is self-closing and self-locking. If the operation requires only that the vault be opened infrequently, such as to remove raw material in the morning and return raw material at night, and is always relocked immediately after use, a \"day gate\" is not required. (4)\n\nThe walls or perimeter of the vault shall be equipped with a tamper-proof closed circuit alarm approved by Underwriter's Laboratories which, when unauthorized entry is attempted, transmits a signal directly to a central station protection company, a local police agency which has a legal duty to respond or a 24-hour control station operated by the registrant. If necessary, due to local conditions or other problems, holdup buttons shall be placed at strategic points of entry to the perimeter area of the vault. (5)\n\nThe vault door shall be equipped with a contact switch. (6)\n\nThe vault shall have one of the following: (i) complete electrical lacing of the walls, floor and ceiling; (ii)\nsensitive ultrasonic equipment within the vault; (iii)\nsensitive sound accumulator system; or\n(iv)\nsuch other device designated to detect illegal entry as may be approved by the department.
