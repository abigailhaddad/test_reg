Example 2:A resident of a county with a combined State and\nlocal tax rate of 7% purchases a television in a county with a combined State\nand local tax rate of 5%, and subsequently returns with the television to the\ncounty of residence. The resident is required to file a Purchaser's Report of\n\nSales and Use Tax and pay the additional tax (based on the difference in the\ntax rates) within 20 days from the date the property was brought into the\ncounty of residence.

(h) Part R3 of chapter 62 of the Laws of\n2003, as amended by part V of chapter 686 of the Laws of 2003, directed the\n\nCommissioner of Taxation and Finance to insert new lines in such personal\nincome tax forms and other tax forms as the commissioner deems appropriate to\nreport unpaid sales and compensating use tax. Therefore, notwithstanding any\nother provision of this Title, unpaid sales and compensating use taxes may be\nreported and paid to the department as prescribed in such personal income tax\nforms or other tax forms as the commissioner deems appropriate.
