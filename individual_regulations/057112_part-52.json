  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 52 - Ex Parte Requests For Judicial Accommodations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) With respect to an accommodation that can\nbe granted only by a judge or judicial officer, a person with a disability, as\ndefined by the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 USC, ch\n126, § 12101 et\nseq.), may apply for one on an ex parte basis. An ex parte application for a\nreasonable accommodation shall: (1)\nbe in\nwriting; (2)\nstate the disability\nand explain how it limits the person's ability to meaningfully participate in\nthe proceeding; (3)\nstate the\naccommodation sought and explain why the accommodation is needed; (4)\nin no manner refer to the subject matter\nor merits of the proceeding that is before the court in which the accommodation\nis sought; (5)\ncontain an\nacknowledgement that the requestor is aware that if upon reviewing the ex parte\napplication the court finds that subsection (d)(1) of this Part applies to the\nrequest, some disability-related information will need to and shall be\ndisclosed to other parties as a result of making the application, even if the\napplication is withdrawn prior to being decided by the court; and\n(6)\nas provided for by CPLR 2217(b), be\naccompanied by an affidavit stating the result of any prior application for\nsimilar relief and specifying the new facts, if any, that were not previously\nshown. (b) An ex parte\napplication for an accommodation under this rule may be made by: a party, subject, or attorney on their own behalf; an attorney on behalf of a party or\nsubject; a party, subject, or attorney on behalf of a witness or other\nparticipant in the proceeding; or a person who has a court-designated legal\nrole or relationship with respect to a party or subject, or is an attorney or\nparalegal providing a party or subject with limited-scope legal assistance, on\nbehalf of the party or subject. Individuals who, because of a disability, are\nunable to put their request in written form may obtain help in doing so from\ncourt personnel. (c) In its\ndiscretion and only as may be reasonably necessary to determine the\napplication, the court may require the applicant to provide the court with\nadditional information about the person's disability and how it limits\nparticipation in the proceeding. (d) The ex parte application and all material\nsubmitted in support shall be kept confidential by the court and not be\ndisclosed by the court to other participants in the proceeding or the public, except in the following limited circumstances and under the following\nconditions: (1)\nthe ex parte application or\nsupporting material contains information about a party's disability that: (i) the court believes is both germane to and\nnecessary for the court to consider in determining the merits of the underlying\nmatter before it; and\n(ii)\nis not\notherwise part of, nor likely to become part of, the record before it. In this circumstance, disclosure by the court to other\nparties and counsel is required, but shall be limited to the existence of the\napplication and the pertinent information, and shall not entitle any other\nparty to be heard on the accommodation application itself; or\n(2)\nthe court has determined that\nthe person for whom the accommodation is sought has a qualifying disability, and the accommodation being sought is an extension of time to submit papers, an\nadjournment, permission to participate remotely, or any other accommodation\nthat, if granted, could potentially unduly prejudice the rights of another\nparty to a fair or timely resolution of the matter. If the court reasonably\nbelieves that granting the requested accommodation will be unduly prejudicial, the court shall disclose only the fact that an ex parte ADA accommodation\napplication has been made and the particular accommodation the application\nseeks. Information pertaining to the nature of the disability, including a\ngeneral description of or any details about the type of disability and the\nlimitations it imposes, shall not be disclosed. Following disclosure, the court shall permit timely\nresponding submissions by affected parties. The arguments raised shall be\nlimited to whether the proposed accommodation would so intrude upon the rights\nof the opponent to a fair or timely resolution of the matter that the nature of\na court proceeding would thereby be fundamentally altered; or\n(3)\nconfidentiality is waived in whole or\npart by the applicant. (e) Once an ex parte accommodation\napplication has been made pursuant to this Part, the court may, on an ex parte\nbasis, engage in discussions with the applicant and/or the person for whom the\naccommodation is sought regarding the application. Such discussions shall be\nkept confidential by the court and not disclosed except as may be provided for\nin subsection (d)(1) of this Part. (f) Provided that the ex parte application\ncomplies with the requirements of this rule and except for what has been\ndisclosed pursuant to subsection (d)(1) of this Part, the court shall find good\ncause to direct that the written application and any supporting material be\nfiled under seal. (g) The court's\ndecision to grant or deny, in whole or in part, the ex parte application shall\nbe issued promptly and memorialized in a written order. (1)\n\nThe order shall: (i) recite the accommodation(s)\nsought; (ii)\nif the application is\ndenied, in whole or in part, explain the reason(s) for denial; (iii)\nif the application is granted, in whole\nor in part, state the accommodation(s) that will be provided and the duration\nof its provision; and\n(iv)\nstate\nthe date upon which the order is provided to the applicant. (2)\n\nThe order shall not contain\ninformation about the person's disability or limitations it imposes unless such\ninformation is redacted and an unredacted copy is filed under seal. If no such\ninformation is contained in the order, all parties shall receive a copy. If any\nsuch information is contained in the order, the applicant shall be provided\nwith both a redacted and unredacted copy of the order, but all other parties\nshall receive only a redacted copy. (h) This rule shall only apply to requests\nfor accommodations acted upon by a judge or judicial officer acting in a\njudicial capacity; it shall not apply to requests for accommodations acted upon\nby court administrators. (i) This\nrule shall not preclude a party or attorney from making an oral or written\napplication for an accommodation on notice. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
