(b) (1)\n\nIf the department proposes to deny an environmental laboratory's application for a certificate of approval, the laboratory shall be given written notice of the proposed denial, stating the reason or reasons for such proposed denial. Such notice shall be sent by certified mail and shall be a final determination to be effective 30 days from the date of the notice, unless reconsideration is requested. (2)\n\nIf the department gives notice of proposed denial, the laboratory may request reconsideration of the proposed denial by submitting a written request for reconsideration to the department within 30 days of the date of the notice of proposed denial. Submission of a request for reconsideration within 30 days shall stay any action to deny a laboratory's application for a certificate of approval, pending the department's decision regarding such request for reconsideration. (3)\n\nThe written request for reconsideration shall be signed by the owner(s) and technical director(s), and shall include all information of the owner(s) and technical director(s) wish to be considered, including any written documentation that would controvert the reason(s) for the denial or disclose that the denial was based upon a mistake of fact. (4)\n\nIf the laboratory properly seeks reconsideration of the proposed denial, the department shall review its proposed denial and shall issue a written determination after reconsideration. The determination after reconsideration may affirm, revoke or modify the proposed denial, allow issuance of a certificate of approval conditional on maintenance of corrective action, or require that the laboratory take corrective action. Such determination shall be the final decision of the department. (c) (1)\n\nAn environmental laboratory's certificate of approval shall be suspended automatically upon a change in laboratory ownership, technical direction, or location. However, provided re-application has been made in writing to the department within 30 calendar days of the change, the department may extend an environmental laboratory's certificate of approval for a period not to exceed 90 calendar days after any change in laboratory ownership, technical direction or location, in order to permit the department to evaluate, as applicable, the character and competence of the new technical director(s) and/or new owner(s) considering requirements in section\n55-2.4\n(b) of this Subpart; the qualifications of the new technical director(s); and/or the effect of the change in location on the environmental laboratory's ability to produce accurate and reliable analytical data. (2)\n\nAn environmental laboratory's certificate of approval shall be suspended automatically upon failure to remit at least the quarterly payment of the annual approval fee pursuant to Subpart 55-3 of this Part, unless otherwise expressly authorized by the department. (3)\n\nAn environmental laboratory's certificate of approval shall be suspended automatically, in affected analytes and/or categories, for failure to maintain a record of at least two satisfactory proficiency testing (PT) events within the three most recent PT events. (4)\n(i) The department may suspend an environmental laboratory's certificate of approval, in affected analytes and/or categories, for reasons including: (a) a pattern of deficiencies on on-site assessment or other demonstration that the laboratory lacks an effective quality system for planning and assessing work performed by the laboratory, and for conducting required quality assurance and quality control procedures to promote and maintain the accuracy and reliability of test results; and\n(b) failure to notify the department of any change in major analytical instrumentation within 30 calendar days of the change. (ii)\n\nIf the department proposes to suspend a laboratory's certificate of approval, the laboratory shall be given written notice of the proposed suspension, stating the reason or reasons for such proposed suspension. Such notice shall be sent by certified mail and shall be a final determination to be effective 10 days from the date of the notice, unless reconsideration is requested.
