(i) When a college, as defined under Section\n2\nof the Education\n\nLaw, is a Client organization, the members of the college's governing board, the president or chief executive, and the provost or chief academic officer are\n\nHigh-Level Individuals. 4)\n\nIntended to be performed or\nprovided\nmeans the goods, services or anything of value have not yet\nbeen performed or provided, but the Lobbyist or Client, as applicable, reasonably anticipates such goods, services, or value to be performed or\nprovided in the future. 5)\n\nLobbyist\nincludes the lobbying firm or organization (the\n\nPrincipal Lobbyist for filing purposes) and every person identified on a\n\nStatement of Registration, as well as any equity partners, officers, or\ndirectors of the organization who operate out of the same geographic office as\nany person identified on a Statement of Registration. 6)\n\nPerformed or provided\nmeans that a State Person or an entity in which the State Person has the\n\nRequisite Involvement either actually performed or provided the goods, services, or anything of value, or had a significant, but not necessarily\nexclusive or primary role, in performing or providing the goods, services or\nanything of value. 7)\n\nReason to know\nmeans a Lobbyist or Client has reason to know\nthat an individual is a State Person or that a State Person has the Requisite\n\nInvolvement with an entity because a reasonable person, based on the totality\nof the facts and circumstances, would conclude that the Lobbyist or Client\nshould know such fact. The following factors may be considered to determine\nwhether a Lobbyist or Client had reason to know: (i) Origins of the relationship between the\nparties; (ii)\n\nLength of such\nrelationship; (iii)\n\nThe type and\nactual value of the goods, services or items provided; and/or\n(iv)\n\nWhether the fact that the individual is\na State Person or the Requisite Involvement of the State Person with the entity\nat issue is generally known to the public. A Lobbyist or Client will be deemed to have had reason to\nknow if such lack of knowledge results from willfully ignoring information that\nwould lead a reasonable person to (i) conclude that the individual was a State\n\nPerson, or that a State Person had the Requisite Involvement, or, (ii)\nundertake further research to determine whether either fact\nexists. 8)\n\nReportable Business Relationship\nmeans a relationship that\nmeets all the criteria listed in Part 943.14(c)(1). 9)\n\nReportable Business Relationship\n\nForm\nmeans the form so entitled available on the Commission's\nwebsite. 10)\n\nRequisite\n\nInvolvement\nin an entity means when a State Person is a proprietor, partner, director, officer, or manager of a non-governmental entity, or owns or\ncontrols 10% or more of the stock of a non-governmental entity (or 1% in the\ncase of a corporation whose stock is regularly traded on an established\nsecurities exchange). 11)\n\nState Person\nincludes: (i) statewide elected officials; (ii)\nmembers of the legislature or legislative employees; (iii)\nheads of State departments and their\ndeputies and assistants, other than members of the board of regents of the\nuniversity of the State of New York who receive no compensation or are\ncompensated on a per diem basis; (iv)\nofficers and employees of statewide\nelected officials; (v) officers and\nemployees of State departments, boards, bureaus, divisions, commissions, councils, or other State agencies; and\n(vi)\nemployees of public authorities (other\nthan multi-state authorities), public benefit corporations and commissions at\nleast one of whose members is appointed by the governor, and members or\ndirectors of such authorities, corporations, and commissions who are\ncompensated other than on a per diem basis.

Such threshold is met once more than\n$1000 in Compensation is: (a) Paid or owed to\nsuch State Person or entity for services Performed or Provided or Intended to\nbe Performed or Provided. 2)\n\nAggregation of Compensation. If a Lobbyist or Client has multiple business relationships\nwith the same State Person, the same entity or entities in which a State Person\nhas the Requisite Involvement, then the value of the Compensation paid for\ngoods, services or anything of value relating to such relationships must be\naggregated. If the aggregated value of such Compensation is more than $1,000\nwithin a Calendar Year, then\neach\nrelationship is a Reportable\n\nBusiness Relationship assuming all other criteria are\nsatisfied. 3)\n\nHow and When\nto Report. Once a Reportable Business Relationship exists a Lobbyist or\n\nClient must complete a Reportable Business Relationship Form and submit it to\nthe Commission within 10 days of the Reportable Business Relationship's\nexistence.

In accordance with sections 1-e and 1-j of the Lobbying Act, which requires Lobbyists and Clients to disclose Reportable Business\n\nRelationships within their respective filings, a Reportable Business\n\nRelationship Form shall be considered a part of the Lobbyist's Statement of\n\nRegistration or the Client's Semi-Annual Report, as applicable. Certain\nentities file both Lobbyist Statements of Registration and Client Semi-Annual\n\nReports as they are considered both a Lobbyist and Client. These entities shall\nonly be required to file the Lobbyist Reportable Business Relationship Form to\ncomply with the filing requirement. 5)\n\nInformation Required in a Reportable\n\nBusiness Relationship Form. For each Reportable Business Relationship, a Lobbyist or\n\nClient must provide the following information within the Reportable Business\n\nRelationship Form: (i) The name and\npublic office address of the State Person or entity with which the State Person\nhas the Requisite Involvement; (ii)\nA description of the general subject or subjects of the transactions between\nthe Lobbyist or Client and the State Person (or the entity with which the State\n\nPerson has the Requisite Involvement); and\n(iii)\n\nThe actual or anticipated amount of\n\nCompensation, including reimbursable Expenses, to be paid and paid to the State\n\nPerson (or entity with which the State Person has the Requisite Involvement) by\nvirtue of the business relationship. 6)\n\nReportable Business Relationships of\n\nHigh-Level Individuals of Client Organizations. For organizations that constitute a Client of a Lobbyist, each Reportable Business Relationship of its High-Level Individuals must be\nreported by the Client organization if: (i) The High-Level Individual entered in to\nthe Reportable Business Relationship in his or her personal capacity; or\n(ii)\n\nAnother entity entered in\nto the Reportable Business Relationship at the direction or request of the\n\nHigh-Level Individual. For example: As a Client organization's\n\nHigh-Level Individuals have significant influence over decisions made by the\norganization, any Reportable Business Relationships under the personal control\nor direction of such High-Level Individuals should also be\ndisclosed. 7)\n\nReportable Business Questionnaire. A Lobbyist or Client organization may use, and rely upon in\ngood faith, the responses to a questionnaire provided by the Commission to send\nto its equity partners, officers, directors or High Level Individuals, as\napplicable, to determine whether such persons have business relationships that\nmust be reported. 8)\n\nDuty to\n\nAmend Report.
