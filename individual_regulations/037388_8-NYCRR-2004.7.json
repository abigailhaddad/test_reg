  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 2004.7 - Application for reinstatement\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn institution or lender against which a final adverse\ndecision has been issued under this Part may at any time request reinstatement\nof its eligibility (or portion thereof) and may submit to the president such\nmaterial as it wishes, or as the president requests, to demonstrate that the\nbasis for such decision has been remedied and is unlikely to recur. The\npresident shall respond to such request within 30 days and, if he denies the\nrequest, shall provide reasons for such denial. An institution or lender whose\nrequest has been denied shall be given an opportunity to show cause why such\nrequest should not be denied. However, the president need not consider a\nrequest to remove a limitation or termination or grant an opportunity to show\ncause if such a request is submitted within six months of a previous denial. The reinstatement of an institution or lender which has been terminated may be\nsubject to reasonable and appropriate conditions or limitations relating to the\ngrounds for such termination. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8\n§\n2004.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
