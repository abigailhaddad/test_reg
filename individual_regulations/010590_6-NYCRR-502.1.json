Tit. 6 § 502.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Recurrent\nflooding of large areas of the State presents serious hazards to, and causes\nadverse effects upon, the health, safety, welfare and property of the people of\nthe State, both within and outside flooded areas. These adverse effects include\nloss of life; loss and damage to private and public property; disruption of\nlives and livelihoods; interruption of commerce, transportation, communication\nand governmental services; and unsanitary and unhealthful living and\nenvironmental conditions. Floodplain management is, therefore, a matter of\n\nState concern and the establishment of improved floodplain management practices\nis important to the health, safety and welfare of all of the State. (b) The implementation of this Part, by all\n\nState agencies will insure that the use of State lands and the siting, construction, administration and disposition of State-owned and State-financed\nfacilities are conducted in ways that will minimize flood hazards and losses. The regulations are required for the State of New York to continue its\nqualification as a participating community in the National Flood Insurance\n\nProgram administered by the Federal Insurance Administration of the Department\nof Housing and Urban Development. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n502.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
