  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-1.3 - Lump sum payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When\na sale is comprised of both a digital product and a digital service, both of\nwhich are apportioned under Subpart 4-3 of this Part, the receipt cannot be\ndivided into separate components for purposes of the application of the rules\nin such Subpart and is considered to be one receipt, regardless of whether the\ncomponents are separately stated for billing purposes. (b) Except as provided in subdivision (a) of\nthis section, in the case of the sale of multiple assets or services in one\ntransaction, the proceeds from the sale shall be reasonably divided among the\ntypes of assets or services sold by the corporation and the receipts or net\ngains from each type must be apportioned using the applicable rule in section\n210-A and the applicable rules in this Subchapter. If the receipt or net gain\ncannot be reasonably divided, the corporation should use the rule that is the\nmost reflective for the type of income generated. A corporation cannot use the\nrules for intermediary transactions provided for in sections\n4-3.8\nand\n4-4.8\nof this Subpart unless\nalmost all of the activities carried on under the agreement are intermediary\ntransactions. Full details regarding the sale and the division of the proceeds\nand gain must be submitted with the corporation's report. (c) Examples. Example 1: Corporation B sells all the assets of one of\nits divisions for a gain, which is properly reported as business income. The\nassets sold consisted of real property, tangible personal property, and\ngoodwill. The portion of the gain attributable to the sale of tangible personal\nproperty shall be apportioned to New York State using the rules for net gains\nfrom the sale of tangible personal property in section\n4-2.1\nof this Part, the portion\nattributable to the sale of real property shall be apportioned to New York\n\nState using the rules for net gains from the sale of real property in section\n4-2.2\nof this Part, and the\nportion attributable to the sale of goodwill shall be apportioned to New York\n\nState using the rules for other services and other business receipts in Subpart\n4-4 of this Part. Example 2: Book Corp sells electronic books and physical\nbooks through its website. Customers purchase a bundle of both an electronic\nand physical book, the price of which includes a discounted price of the\nelectronic and physical book, but the breakdown is not separately stated. For\nbundled purchases, the electronic book is available for immediate download by\nthe customer and the physical book is shipped from Book Corp to the customer. Customer B, with a New York billing address, purchases a bundled purchase of an\nelectronic and a physical book commingled into one receipt. As the receipt\ncannot be reasonably divided between the electronic book and the physical book, the entire receipt should be sourced as a sale of tangible personal\nproperty. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
