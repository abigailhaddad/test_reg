Tit. 9 § 1.15 - Executive order no. 15: relating to procedures for the submission and settlement of grievances of state employees\n\nState Regulations\nBY VIRTUE of the authority vested in me by the Constitution\nand Laws of the State of New York, it is hereby Ordered as Follows: I. Preamble. In order to establish a more\nharmonious and cooperative relationship between the State and its employees, it\nis hereby declared to be the policy of this Administration and the purpose of\nthis Order to provide for the settlement of differences through an orderly\ngrievance procedure. It is also the policy of this Administration to assure to\n\nState employees the right to full freedom of association, self-organization and\ndesignation of representatives of their own choosing for the purpose of\nadjustment of their grievances, free from interference, restraint, coercion, or\nreprisal. All the provisions of this Order shall be liberally construed for the\naccomplishment of this purpose. II. Basic standards and principles. 1. Every\nemployee shall have the right to join or to continue as a member of any\nemployee association or labor organization; provided, however, that no employee\nshall organize or help to organize or become a member of any society or group\nof persons which teaches or advocates that the government of the United States\nor of any State or of any political subdivision thereof shall be overthrown by\nforce or violence, or by any unlawful means. 2. Every employee shall have the right to\npresent his grievance in accordance with the procedures prescribed hereunder, with or without a representative of his own choosing, free from interference, coercion, restraint, discrimination or reprisal. There shall be no\ndiscrimination against any employee because such employee has formed, joined, or chosen to be represented by any employee organization for the purposes of\nthis Order. 3. It is a fundamental\nresponsibility of supervisors at all levels to consider, and, commensurate with\nauthority delegated by the head of the department or agency, to take\nappropriate action promptly and fairly on a grievance of any subordinate\nemployee or employees. To this end appropriate authority shall be delegated to\nsupervisors by heads of departments and agencies. 4.

Proposed new rules or modifications of existing rules governing working\nconditions should, wherever practicable, be announced in advance and discussed\nin conference with employee representatives before they are established. Employees are encouraged to contribute their experiences and their ideas to the\nsolution of problems in the public service and to acquire a feeling of\nidentification with the objectives of their department or agency. 6. Informal resolution of differences prior\nto initiation of action under the formal grievance procedure is\nencouraged. III. Grievances; procedural requirements. 1. Departmental procedures. The head of each State department or agency shall, subject to the approval of the Grievance Appeals Board established pursuant to\nthis Order, establish formal procedures for submission of grievances by\nemployees and for prompt and orderly consideration and determination of such\ngrievances by supervisors and the department or agency head. Wherever\npracticable, with due consideration to organization, size and geographic spread\nof a department or agency, procedures for such department or agency shall\nprovide for no more than two procedural stages, as follows: The first stage shall consist of the employee's\npresentation of his grievance to his immediate supervisor who shall, to the\nextent necessary or appropriate, consult with and permit the employee to\nconsult with any of his higher ranking supervisors indirect line below the\nlevel of the department or agency head, or his designated representative, or\nwith the agency personnel officer. Discussion and resolution of grievances in\nthe first stage shall be on an oral basis. Group grievances should be presented\nin the first instance to the lowest ranking supervisor common to all employees\nin the group. The final departmental stage shall be a determination by\nthe department or agency head or, at his election, by a duly designated\nrepresentative with full responsibility for determination of grievances in the\nfinal departmental stage. If a grievance is not satisfactorily settled at a\nlower stage the employee may request a review and determination thereof by the\nhead of the department or agency or his designated representative. The specific\nnature of the grievance and the facts relating thereto shall be reduced to\nwriting jointly or separately by the employee and by the appropriate\nsupervisor. The head of the department or agency, or his designated\nrepresentative, shall, on request of the employee, hold an informal hearing at\nwhich the employee and his representative may appear and present oral\nstatements, or he may designate one or more officers or employees of the\ndepartment or agency to conduct such informal hearing and to submit a report\nthereon with recommendations. The final determination of such grievance shall\nbe made by the head of the department or agency or his designated\nrepresentative. Wherever it is not practicable to limit departmental or agency\nprocedures to two stages, such additional intermediate stages as may be\nnecessary and the procedures applicable thereto may be established, subject to\nthe approval of the Grievance Appeals Board. 2. Representation. An employee shall be\nentitled to a representative of his own choosing in the presentation and\nprocessing of a grievance at all stages under this Order. 3. Time limitations.
