Tit. 6 § 608.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Banks means\nthat land area immediately adjacent to, and which slopes toward, the bed of a\nwatercourse, and which is necessary to maintain the integrity of a watercourse. For purposes of this Part, a bank will not be considered to extend more than 50\nfeet horizontally from the mean highwater line; with the following exception: where a generally uniform slope of 45 degrees (100 percent) or greater adjoins\nthe bed of the watercourse, the band is extended to the crest of the slope or\nthe first definable break in slope, either a natural or constructed (i.e. road\nor railroad grade) feature, lying generally parallel to the\nwatercourse. (b) Bed means that\nland area of a watercourse covered by water at mean high water. (c) Breach of a dam shall have the meaning\nset forth in Part 673 of this Title. (d) Commissioner means the Commissioner of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation or a duly authorized designee. (e) Construct means to build. With respect to\na dam, construct shall have the meaning set forth in Part 673 of this\n\nTitle. (f) Dam shall have the\nmeaning set forth in Part 673 of this Title. (g) Department means the Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation. (h) Docking facility means any marina, boat basin, marine terminal, and any other\nareas on navigable waters containing a single structure or a collection of\nrelated structures, such as docks, piers, platforms, bulkheads, breakwaters, and pilings, used for the reception, securing, and protection of boats, ships, barges or other water craft. (i) Emergency Action Plan shall have the meaning set forth in Part 673 of this\n\nTitle. (j) Engineer, with respect\nto the requirements of this Part that are applicable to dams, shall have the\nmeaning set forth in Part 673 of this Title.

(l) Erect, as used in ECL article 15 section\n0503, with respect to a dam, means to construct a new dam. (m) Fill means any solid or semi-solid, organic or inorganic material including. but not limited to, earth, clay, silt, sand, gravel, stone, rock, shale, concrete, ashes, cinder, slag, metal, stumps, solid waste as defined in Part 360 of this Title, or any other similar\nmaterial, whether or not enclosed or contained by a structure. (n) Height, with respect to a dam, is the\nvertical dimension from the downstream toe of a dam at its lowest point to the\ntop of a dam. (o) Indirect\nplacement of fill means positioning material landward and in close proximity to\nthe mean high water elevation of a waterbody such that the material is\nintroduced into the waterbody by natural erosive forces thereby creating a fill\nbelow the mean high water elevation. (p) Local public corporation means any\nmunicipal corporation or district corporation, as is set forth in ECL article 1\nsection 0303 subdivision 15, and further defined in the General Construction\n\nLaw section 66 subdivisions 2 and 3. (q) Maximum impoundment capacity is the\nvolume of water that is impounded when the water level is at the top of a\ndam. (r) Mean low water or mean\nhigh water means, respectively, the approximate average low water level or high\nwater level for a given body of water at a given location, that distinguishes\nbetween predominantly aquatic and predominantly terrestrial habitat as\ndetermined, in order of use by the following: (1)\navailable hydrologic data, calculations, and other relevant information concerning water levels (e.g., discharge, storage, tidal, and other recurrent water elevation data); (mean high water\nelevations are established, using this method, for certain waterbodies as\npresented in section\n608.11\nof this Part); (2)\nvegetative characteristics (e.g., location, presence, absence or destruction of terrestrial or aquatic\nvegetation); (3)\nphysical\ncharacteristics (e.g., clear natural line impressed on a bank, scouring, shelving, or the presence of sediments, litter or debris); and\n(4)\nother appropriate means that consider the\ncharacteristics of the surrounding area. (s) Moorings means a float, buoy, chain, cable, rope, pile, spar, dolphin or any other device or combination of devices\nthat are anchored or fixed in navigable waters of the State to which a vessel\ncan be made fast. (t) Mooring area\nmeans a collection of individual moorings located within a definable area of\nnavigable waters of the State and under single private ownership or\ncontrol. (u) Navigable waters of\nthe State means all lakes, rivers, streams and other bodies of water in the\n\nState that are navigable in fact or upon which vessels with a capacity of one\nor more persons can be operated notwithstanding interruptions to navigation by\nartificial structures, shallows, rapids or other obstructions, or by seasonal\nvariations in capacity to support navigation. It does not include waters that\nare surrounded by land held in single private ownership at every point in their\ntotal area. (v) Ordinary\nmaintenance, with respect to a dam, means work that does not affect the\nstructural integrity or function of a dam or an aspect of the safety of the\ndam. Ordinary maintenance is work involved in the routine or regular upkeep of\na dam, and includes, by way of example only, activities such as debris removal, mowing grass, cleaning trash racks, and exercising valves. (w) Owner, with respect to a dam, shall have\nthe meaning set forth in Part 673 of this Title. (x) Perimeter means a boundary of a docking\nfacility or mooring area consisting of a series of connected imaginary lines on\na plan or map, encompassing all related structures such as docks, bulkheads, breakwaters, pilings, piers, platforms or moorings and the travel lanes and\nberthing areas that function together to create a facility or area at which\nvessels may be docked or moored. (y) Person means any individual, firm, copartnership, association or corporation, other than the State or a public\ncorporation. (z) Platform means a\ngenerally horizontal, flat surface located in, on or over a waterbody, on which\nstructures can be constructed or any activities can be conducted. (aa)\n\nProtected stream means any stream or\nparticular portion of a stream for which there has been adopted by the\ndepartment or any of its predecessors any of the following classifications or\nstandards: AA, AA(t), A, A(t), B, B(t), or C(t).

(ab)\n\nPublic corporation means a municipal or\ndistrict corporation, a city, town, village or school district or a public\nbenefit corporation. (ac)\n\nRemoval\nof a dam means eliminating a dam to the approximate original topographic\ncontours.

Repair or reconstruction includes, by way of example only, activities such as changing the spillway elevation or spillway capacity of the\ndam. Repair or reconstruction does not include ordinary maintenance. (ae)\n\nSingle private ownership means the\nownership by a person, joint ownership by more than one person or a single\nnongovernmental entity such as an association, corporation, trust or estate.

A stream does not include a pond or lake having a\nsurface area of greater than 10 acres at mean low water level. (ag) Substantial reconstruction of structures, other than\ndams, means restoration or rebuilding involving 50 percent or more of an\nexisting fixed structure's surface area. (ah)\n\nWatercourse means that area of land\nwithin which or upon which the flow of water is ordinarily confined due to\nexisting topography. (ai)\n\nWater-dependent use means an activity that can only be conducted on, in, over\nor adjacent to a waterbody because such activity requires access to water, and\ninvolves the use of water as an integral part of the activity.
