  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 6-3.11 - Treatment\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll spray grounds shall be equipped with a recirculation system which includes filtration and disinfection facilities to provide water quality consistent with the bacteriological, chemical and physical standards required in Section\n6-3.19\nof this Subpart. The filtration and chemical treatment systems for the spray pad treatment tank must operate 24 hours a day. (a) Recirculation rate. The spray pad treatment tank water must be re-circulated and treated in accordance with the approved design rates. (b) Filtration. (1)\n\nSand filters. (i) High-rate sand filters (pressure or vacuum) can be operated at a filter rate up to 15 gallons per minute (gpm)/square foot (sf). (ii)\n\nFilter air release valves shall be opened daily or more frequently if necessary to remove air, which collects in the filters. (iii)\n\nSand filters shall be backwashed at a flow rate of 12 to 15 gpm/sf or at the design rate recommended by the manufacturer. (2)\n\nDiatomaceous earth filters. (i) Diatomaceous earth filters shall be properly maintained and operated according to the manufacturer's instructions and at a filter rate not to exceed two gpm/sf with body feed or 1.5 gpm/sf without body feed. (ii)\n\nDiatomaceous earth filter backwash water must discharge to the sewer system through a separation tank. The separation tank sludge shall be disposed of or treated as a solid waste material in accordance with local and State laws, rules and regulations. (3)\n\nCartridge filters. (i) Cartridge filters shall be operated at a filter rate not to exceed a maximum of 0.375 gpm/sf. (ii)\n\nCleaning of cartridge filters must be in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. One complete spare set of cartridges shall be available at all times to facilitate cleaning. (4)\n\nFlow measurement. All flow meters shall be maintained in accordance with provisions in section\n6-3.24\n(f)(8)\nof this Subpart. (c) Disinfection/chemical treatment. An automatic controller is required for monitoring and adjusting the level of free residual disinfectant and pH in the spray pad treatment tank. The following chemical disinfectants have been approved for use in spray grounds: (1)\n\nDisinfection with chlorine. When calcium hypochlorite or sodium hypochlorite are used to disinfect a spray pad and the spray pad treatment tank the dose of chlorine or chlorine compound shall be sufficient to maintain a concentration of at least 2.0 mg/l free chlorine throughout the system including the treatment tank and water emanating from the spray features. A free chlorine residual of 10.0 mg/l shall not be exceeded in any spray pad treatment tank during use. All chlorine solutions shall be added to the spray pad water by chemical feed equipment conforming with standards contained in section\n6-3.24\n(h)(1)\nof this Subpart. (i) Handling of calcium hypochlorite. When calcium hypochlorite is used as a disinfectant, extreme caution must be taken in the handling and mixing of the chemical to avoid possible fire and explosion hazards. A dry, aboveground, locked storage area shall be provided. Clean inert materials shall be used, and mixing must be by pouring the chemical into water and never by pouring water into the chemical. (2)\n\nDisinfection with bromine. When bromine is used as the disinfectant, the following shall be followed: (i) bromine shall be fed on a continuous basis; (ii)\na concentration of at least 4.4 mg/l bromine residual shall be maintained throughout the system including the spray pad treatment tank water and water emanating from the spray features; and\n(iii)\nsolid-stick or tablet-type bromine (brom-chlor-dimethyl-hydantoin) shall be used with feed equipment conforming to the standards contained in section 6- 3.24(h)(iv) of this Subpart. (3)\n\nDisinfection with ultraviolet light. Ultraviolet light disinfection is required in addition to an approved chemical disinfectant listed in this section and shall be used as follows, unless another treatment process has been approved in accordance with section\n6-3.24\n(h)(3)(i)\nof this Subpart: (i) ultraviolet light shall be used to disinfect water provided to the spray pad in accordance with the approved plans and specifications; (ii)\nultraviolet light disinfection systems shall have a properly calibrated light intensity meter, automatic water flow shutoff in the event the light intensity decreases below the manufacturer's recommended level for the flow rate and an alarm to advise the attendant of a system malfunction; (iii)\nthe ultraviolet light units shall be cleaned in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations; (iv)\nthe ultraviolet light unit's ultraviolet light intensity meter reading shall be monitored and recorded as least two times daily. When the output intensity falls below the setpoint intensity, conditions causing decreased ultraviolet light intensity at the sensor shall be evaluated and corrected. The ultraviolet lamp(s) shall be replaced when the decreased ultraviolet light intensity is due to lamp failure; (v) an operation log shall be maintained at the facility and entries shall be made for dates and type of maintenance and repair, including cleaning, lamp replacement, etc.; and\n(vi)\nlamps shall be replaced in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations. (4)\n\nPositive feed equipment shall be provided for pH control and the spray pad treatment tank water pH shall be maintained between 7.2 and 7.8. (5)\n\nOther disinfectants. Disinfectants other than those listed above may be used only if the State Commissioner of Health determines they are safe and effective when used in accordance with the manufacturer's directions. (6)\n\nTest kits/testing. DPD test kits with reagents no more than one year old capable of measuring pH and chlorine or bromine residuals, shall be available at each spray ground. Tests shall be conducted and recorded for pH and free and total chlorine or bromine residual at the beginning, during, and at the end of each use period. Where required, reagents for alkalinity and hardness tests shall be available. Where ozone generating equipment is installed, ozone testing shall be conducted in accordance with section\n6-3.24\n(h)(5)(i)\nof this Subpart. (d) Chemicals. Only chemicals approved for water supply use by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, as food additives by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or by the State Commissioner of Health, shall be used in spray grounds. Where equipment for chemical addition is required, it shall be installed and operated in accordance with section\n6-3.24\n(h) of this Subpart. All chemical containers, including those used with chemical feeders, must be clearly labeled regarding their contents. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n6-3.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
