  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-8.3 - Special provisions for tower cranes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Tower crane erection. (1)\n\nEvery tower crane used in construction\nshall be erected in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations and\nunder the supervision of a competent, designated person experienced in tower\ncrane erection. (2)\n\nPrior to the\nerection of any tower crane the ability of the supporting system, including\nslabs, foundations and the underlying soil to support the loads intended to be\nimposed thereon shall be certified by a professional engineer licensed to\npractice in the State of New York. (3)\n\nTower cranes shall be erected so that the\njibs and counterweights can swing 360 degrees without striking any building, structure or any other object. (4)\n\nPrior to initial use, a newly erected tower crane shall undergo a static\noverload test in the direction of least stability. Such test shall consist of\nsuspending a load at the rated load and at the maximum radius for a period of\nat least one hour. Subsequent to such test, settlement of the equipment and\nload-bearing foundation shall be within the limits specified by the tower crane\nmanufacturer. A written report of such test shall be kept on the job site\navailable for examination by the commissioner. (b) Tower crane capacity chart. Every tower\ncrane shall be provided with a capacity chart which shall be posted and\nmaintained legible in the cab of the crane clearly visible to the operator from\nhis operating position. Where a remote control stand is used a duplicate of\nsuch capacity chart shall be affixed to such control stand. Such capacity chart\nshall be furnished by the manufacturer of the crane and shall include a full\nand complete range of crane load ratings at all stated operating radii for each\nallowable speed and for each recommended counterweight loading. (c) Tower crane construction. (1)\n\nLimit switches. Limit switches which\nshall be sealed against unauthorized tampering shall be provided as follows: (i) To limit trolley travel at either end of\nthe jib. (ii)\n\nTo limit load block\nupward motion to prevent two-blocking. (iii)\n\nTo limit the load being lifted to no\nmore than 110 percent of the rated load upon completion of the static overload\ntest as specified in paragraph (a) (4) of this section\n23-8.3, above. (2)\n\nCabs and remote control\nstations. (i) Tower crane cabs and remote\ncontrol stations for such cranes shall be protected from falling objects and\nmaterial and from the elements. (ii)\n\nCab windows shall be constructed of\ntransparent safety glazing material and shall provide clear visibility in all\ndirections. (iii)\n\nCabs and remote\ncontrol stations for tower cranes shall be heated to a temperature of at least\n60 degrees Fahrenheit during cold weather whenever occupied. (iv)\n\nCabs and remote control stations for\ntower cranes shall be adequately ventilated. (3)\n\nAccessibility. Adequate and safe means of\naccess to and egress from the cabs and machinery platforms of tower cranes\nshall be provided. Where it is necessary to inspect the jib attachments located\non the jib of any tower crane, a footwalk with suitable handrails shall be\nprovided for such inspections. (4)\n\nBrakes. In addition to the hoisting brakes required by this Subpart, tower\ncranes shall be provided with the following: (i) Slewing brake. Every tower crane shall be\nprovided with a brake having adequate holding power in either direction to\nprevent movement of the jib when desired during normal crane operation. Such\nbrake shall be capable of being set in the holding position and kept there\nwithout attention from the operator. (ii)\n\nTrolley brake. The trolley of every\ntower crane shall be provided with an automatic brake or device capable of\nstopping movement of the trolley in case of trolley rope breakage. (5)\n\nElectrical equipment. (i) All electrical equipment of tower cranes\nshall be grounded. (ii)\n\nAll tower\ncranes shall be provided with lightning protection. (iii)\n\nAll controls of tower cranes shall be\nof the deadman type. (iv)\n\nIn the\nevent of power failure, all tower crane brakes shall be set\nautomatically. (6)\n\nClimbing jacks. Where climbing jacks are provided for tower cranes such jacks\nshall be equipped with over-pressure relief valves, pressure gages and check\nvalves designed to retain pressure in case of hydraulic line failure. (7)\n\nWind velocity device. Every tower crane\nshall be provided with a device for measuring wind velocity. The sensing\nportion of every such device shall be mounted on the highest point of the crane\nwhile the readout of every such device shall be located in the cab or remote\ncontrol station of the tower crane. (8)\n\nCounterweights. Counterweights used on\ntower cranes shall be in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations. Counterweights shall be securely fastened to the counter jib to prevent pieces\nfrom being accidentally dislodged. (d) Inspection and maintenance. (1)\n\nTower cranes shall be inspected and\nmaintained in accordance with the manufacturers' recommendations. (2)\n\nWhere the mast of any tower crane runs\nthrough floor openings in the building or other structure in which the crane is\nmounted and the mast is secured by wedges or braces, such wedges or braces\nshall be inspected for tightness and dislocation at least twice each working\nday. (e) Operation of\ntower cranes. (1)\n\nOperators. Tower cranes\nshall be operated only by persons who are qualified in accordance with the\nprovisions of section\n23-8.5\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nOperation in windy conditions. Tower\ncranes shall not be operated when the wind speed is at any time greater than 30\nmiles per hour. Tower cranes shall not be raised to new operating levels when\nthe wind speed exceeds 20 miles per hour. (3)\n\nOperation without counterweight\nprohibited. No tower crane shall be operated without the full amount of ballast\nor counterweight in place as specified by the manufacturer or builder of the\ncrane or by a professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of New\n\nYork. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n23-8.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
