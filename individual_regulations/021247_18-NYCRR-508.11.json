(b) Except for\nexaminations covered under subdivision (a) of this section, the reimbursable\nfees for services performed under the C/THP will be those established by the\n\nState Department of Health and approved by the Division of the Budget. The\nC/THP fee for a private physician will be based upon a complete physical\nexamination performed according to the periodicity schedule.

However, private physicians are eligible to\nseek reimbursement for ancillary services (e.g., Mantoux test, immunizations)\non a fee-for-service basis, regardless of date of service. Notes\nN.Y.
