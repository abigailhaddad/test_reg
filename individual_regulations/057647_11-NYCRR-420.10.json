(2)\n\nOpt out definition. Opt out means a direction by the consumer that the licensee not disclose nonpublic personal financial information about that consumer to a nonaffiliated third party, other than as permitted by section\n420.13, 420.14 or\n420.15\nof this Part. (3)\n\nExamples of reasonable opportunity to opt out. A licensee provides a consumer with a reasonable opportunity to opt out if: (i) By mail. The licensee mails the notices required in paragraph (1) of this subdivision to the consumer and allows the consumer to opt out by mailing a form, calling a toll free telephone number, or any other reasonable means within 30 days from the date the licensee mailed the notices. (ii)\n\nBy electronic means. A customer opens an on-line account with the licensee and agrees to receive the notices required in paragraph (1) of this subdivision electronically, and the licensee allows the customer to opt out by any reasonable means within 30 days after the date that the customer acknowledges receipt of the notices in conjunction with opening the account. (iii)\n\nIsolated transaction with consumer. For an isolated transaction, such as providing the consumer with an insurance quote, a licensee provides the consumer with a reasonable opportunity to opt out if the licensee provides the consumer the notices required in paragraph (1) of this subdivision at the time of the transaction and requests that the consumer decide, as a necessary part of the transaction, whether to opt out before completing the transaction. (b) Application of opt out to all consumers and all nonpublic personal financial information.

(2)\n\nUnless a licensee complies with this section, the licensee may not, directly or through any affiliate, disclose any nonpublic personal financial information about a consumer that the licensee has collected, regardless of whether the licensee collected it before or after receiving the direction to opt out from the consumer. (c) Partial opt out. A licensee may allow a consumer to select certain nonpublic personal financial information or certain nonaffiliated third parties with respect to which the consumer wishes to opt out. Notes\nN.Y.
