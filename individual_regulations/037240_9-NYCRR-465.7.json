  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 465.7 - Conciliation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Endeavors. (1)\n\nThe division, may, at any time after the\nfiling of the complaint, endeavor to eliminate the unlawful discriminatory\npractice complained of by conference, conciliation and persuasion. (2)\nA conciliation proceeding, to be attended\nby the parties, should be convened in all appropriate cases by the division, prior to a determination after investigation, in an attempt to resolve the\nparties' differences. Reasonable adjournments of such conciliation proceeding\nmay be given at the discretion of the investigator or the regional director. Failure of a party to attend the proceeding or cooperate with the investigator\nmay result in a determination based on the material already in the record, with\nthe party who absented him or herself for insufficient reasons barred from\nsubmitting additional evidence prior to the determination of cause or no\ncause. (3)\n\nOffers of conciliation\nby respondent shall be reviewed by the regional director to determine whether\nsuch conciliation offer is substantial enough to require a determination, in\nthe public interest, to terminate the proceeding, on notice to complainant, if\nthe complainant unreasonably refuses to accept the conciliation. The following\ncriteria are among those which should be considered: (i) probability of success after full\ninvestigation; (ii)\nreasonableness\nof offer; (iii)\nreasonableness of\ncomplainant's refusal, if any; (iv)\nthe amount of the complainant's economic loss and respondent's degree of\nresponsibility therefor; (v) in\nappropriate cases, the evidence of the amount of complainant's mental pain and\nsuffering; (vi)\nthe egregiousness\nof the discrimination charged; and\n(vii)\nwhether the public interest is best\nserved by the continuation of the proceedings. (4)\n\nObjections by a complainant to a proposed\nconciliation agreement must be written and shall be delivered or mailed within\n15 days of the service of the proposed agreement by the division upon\ncomplainant, or earlier, i.e., if made in the context of a conciliation\nproceeding where both parties or their representatives are present. If the\nagreement was served by mail, the time for objections shall be extended by five\ndays. The objections shall be specific and in detail. (5)\n\nWhere the regional director finds the\nterms of the proposed conciliation agreement to be in the public interest, and\nthat the complainant's objections to the proposed conciliation agreement are\nwithout substance, he or she may: (i) dismiss\nthe complaint for administrative convenience; (ii)\ntake other appropriate action pursuant\nto section\n297.3\n(c) of\nthe law; or\n(iii)\nupon request of\nrespondent, issue an recommended equitable order, for consideration by the\ncommissioner, providing that the respondent will pay the complainant the amount\nproposed in the conciliation agreement and dismissing the complaint on the\nmerits. (6)\nA special\nconciliation calendar shall be maintained to schedule all pre-determination\nconciliations. (7)\n\nNotice of\nconciliation hearings shall be accompanied by a statement advising complainant\nof a possible waiting period before the case is heard by an administrative law\njudge, based upon then current division statistics, updated every six\nmonths. (b) Terms. The\nterms of a conciliation agreement shall include provisions requiring the\nrespondent to refrain from the commission of unlawful discriminatory practices\nin the future, and may contain such further provisions as may be agreed upon by\nthe regional director and the respondent. (c) Nondisclosure. The division shall not\ndisclose what has transpired in the course of its endeavors at conciliation and\npersuasion, except to the parties and their representatives. (d) Successful conciliation. (1)\n\nIf the respondent agrees to the terms of\nconciliation, as prepared by the regional director, then the regional director\nshall serve them upon the complainant. (2)\n\nIf the complainant agrees to the terms of\nthe agreement, or fails to object to such terms within 15 days after its\nservice, the division may formally enter into the proposed conciliation\nagreement by issuing an order embodying such conciliation agreement. The\ndivision shall serve a copy of such order upon all parties to the\nproceeding. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
