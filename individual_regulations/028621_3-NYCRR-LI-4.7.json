  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.7 - Conflict of interest-mortgage loans by savings bank on real estate sold by trustee of the savings bank\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was presented with the following facts: A\ntrustee of a savings bank is the owner of a real estate business (hereinafter\nthe company). Since his election to the board of trustees over two years ago, one-third of all the mortgage loans made by the savings bank were made to\npurchasers of properties sold by the company. The purchasers made their\nmortgage applications to the savings bank at the suggestion of the trustee. Neither the trustee nor the company received any commission or fee for the\nplacement of the mortgage. On the above facts, it was asked whether a conflict of\ninterest problem existed because of the trustee's interest in the realty firm. The department responded that for many years it had taken the position that\nactivity of the sort described above would be inconsistent with section\n247\n(2)(a)\nof the Banking Law and article 10, section 3 of the New York State Constitution. It stated that the essential\nrationale for its position was that the only practical way for the department\nto keep a savings bank trustee to the highest standard in this area is by\nassuring that he does not place himself in a position where he might have to\nexplain away his acts. Continuing to believe that the above reasoning was\nsound, the department concluded that, on the facts presented, a conflict of\ninterest existed. DATED: August 1, 1969\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp.
