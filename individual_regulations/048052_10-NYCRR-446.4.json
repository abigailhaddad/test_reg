  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 446.4 - Alternative cost allocation bases-sequence of allocation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Effective dates. (1)\n\nFor cost reporting periods ending\n\nDecember 31, 1981 and before, alternative cost allocation bases/sequence of\nallocation may be utilized without the prior approval of the Medicare fiscal\nintermediary. When utilizing an alternative cost allocation base or sequence of\nallocation, full documentation as to the necessity, appropriateness, and\nmethodology utilized must be provided. The criteria in subdivision (d) of this\nsection must be met. This requirement applies to all third-party\npayors. (2)\n\nFor cost reporting\nperiods beginning on January 1, 1982 and thereafter, when a hospital wishes to\nchange its allocation basis for a particular cost center or the order in which\nthe cost centers are allocated, because it believes the change will result in\nmore appropriate and more accurate allocations, the hospital must make a\nwritten request to its Medicare fiscal intermediary for approval of the change\nand submit reasonable justification for such change no later than 90 days prior\nto the beginning of the cost reporting period for which the change is to apply. This requirement will apply to all cost-finding methods and all third-party\npayors. (b) The Medicare\nfiscal intermediary's approval of a hospital's request will be furnished to the\nhospital in writing. Where the Medicare fiscal intermediary approves the\nhospital's request for an alternative basis or sequence of allocation, the\nchange must be applied to the cost reporting period for which the request was\nmade and to all subsequent cost reporting periods unless the intermediary\napproves a subsequent request for change by the hospital. The effective date of\nany change of basis or sequence of allocation will be the beginning of the\nfirst cost reporting period for which the request has been made. (c) In reviewing the hospital's request, the\n\nMedicare fiscal intermediary will apply the following criteria: (1)\n\nBasis of allocation. (i) The hospital must agree to maintain and\nreport all statistics needed for the recommended basis of allocation as well as\nthe alternative basis of allocation. The hospital will report the recommended\nbasis on an additional completed Worksheet, prominently marked at the top\n\"Original Recommended Basis\". For New York State reporting purposes, this\nrequirement is effective for cost reporting periods beginning in 1980. For\n\nMedicare reporting purposes, this requirement is effective for cost reporting\nperiods beginning in 1981. (ii)\n\nAny\nalternative basis of allocation expressed solely in terms of percentages will\nbe not acceptable. (iii)\n\nAny\nalternative basis of allocation must be supported by auditable statistics that\nare maintained on a regular basis. (iv)\n\nThe alternative basis of allocation must\ndirectly relate to the provision of services by the affected cost\ncenter. (v) The alternative basis\nof allocation must produce a clearly more accurate allocation of cost than the\nrecommended basis of cost. For example, the recommended basis of allocation for\ncafeteria costs is full-time equivalent employees. If the provider chooses to\nmaintain an alternative basis of allocation of sales value of meals served to\nemployees by functional cost center, a more accurate allocation would result. Alternatively, the recommended basis of allocation for laundry is pounds of\nlaundry; however, the use of the number of items issued would not result in a\nmore accurate allocation of costs. (vi)\n\nOnly one statistical basis of allocation\nmay be used for each cost center. (2)\n\nSequence of allocation. The sequence of\nallocation of step-down cost finding is based upon the assumption that a cost\ncenter furnishes more services to the cost centers that follow it in the\nsequence of allocation than it receives from the cost centers that precede it\nin the sequence of allocation, and that a cost center receives more services\nfrom the cost centers that precede it in the sequence of allocation than it\nfurnishes to the cost centers that follow it in the sequence of allocation. In\norder to justify the use of an alternative sequence of allocation, a provider\nmust establish through auditable records that the dollar value of goods and\nservices exchanged among cost centers is different than that contemplated in\nthe sequence recommended in the cost reporting forms. (d) Alternative cost allocation bases or the\nsequence of allocation, utilized in accordance with this section, must be\nutilized across all third-party payors. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
