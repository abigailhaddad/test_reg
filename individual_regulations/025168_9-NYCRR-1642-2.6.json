  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-2.6 - Unvouchered disbursements\n\nState Regulations\n\nExceptions to the rule that all disbursements of a\nlocal agency shall be vouchered and shall (with the exception of petty cash\nitems) be made by check arise as follows: (a) Bank debits. Bank debits include service\ncharges made by banks and bad checks, and are supported by debit memos included\nwith the bank statements and, in the case of a bad check, by the check itself, to which is ordinarily attached a slip stating the reason the check is\nreturned. Bank debits are recorded in the cash disbursements-voucher register\n(see par. 303.5 [FN*]), account 1122, Tenants Accounts Receivable, being\ncharged therein for bad checks received from tenants and for charges made by\nthe bank in connection with such check and the applicable cost or expense\naccount being charged for other bank debits representing service charges. No\naccounts payable vouchers are prepared for bank debits, inasmuch as no checks\nare to be drawn by the local agency. The supports for the entry in the cash\ndisbursements-voucher register shall be the bank debit memo filed with the bank\nstatement for the particular month. (b) Proceeds of temporary loan note issue. In\nconnection with the refinancing of a temporary loan note issue (see Part 1643, Financing) the paying agent will ordinarily apply the proceeds of the new issue\ndirectly to the payment of principal and interest on the maturing issue in\naccordance with the authorization contained in a letter of instruction. In such\nevent, the proceeds applied will not pass through the local agency's bank\naccount and no accounts payable vouchers are prepared inasmuch as no checks are\nto be drawn by the local agency. The entries to record the direct application\nof the proceeds of an issue of temporary loan notes are described in Part 1643, Financing, and are supported by the underlying financing documents, bank\nstatements, correspondence, etc. (c) Proceeds of bond issue. The proceeds of a\nbond issue and premiums thereon, if any, may, similarly, be applied by the\n\nState Comptroller directly to the payment of principal and interest on maturing\ntemporary indebtedness. In such event, similarly, no accounts payable vouchers\nare prepared inasmuch as no checks are to be drawn by the local agency. The\nentries to record the direct application by the Comptroller of the proceeds of\na bond issue and the premium thereon, if any, are described in Part 1643, Financing, and are supported by the underlying contract for State aid and\ncorrespondence and authorization from the division. [FN*] So in original. Should probably refer to \"§\n1642-3.3\n\". Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-2.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
