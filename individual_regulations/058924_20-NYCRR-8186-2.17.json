  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-2.17 - Determination of the full value of assessing units which do not implement revaluation or updates\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For\nmarket value surveys with valuation dates on or after January 1, 1996, in order\nto determine the full value of assessing units which do not complete\nrevaluation or update projects which are the basis of estimates of aggregate\nfull value measurement as provided in section\n8186-2.15\nof this Subpart, the following apply. (b) Preparation and stratification of\nmeasured rolls. (1)\n\nThe measured roll is the\nassessment roll for the year immediately preceding the calendar year of the\nvaluation date of the market value survey, except as provided in the procedures\nfor the appropriate market value survey. (2)\n\nThe measured roll is collected by ORPTS\nand prepared for use as provided in the procedures for the appropriate market\nvalue survey. (3)\n\nProperty to be\nisolated from the measured roll is identified and removed. (4)\n\nThe measured roll is stratified into\nsurvey units, major types or classes, and intervals. (5)\n\nLarge units are identified. (c) Determination of sample\nparcels. (1)\n\nThe number of initial sample\nparcels for each interval is determined. (2)\n\nThere may be no initial sample parcels\nrequired in particular major types if the criteria regarding the size of the\nmajor type in the procedures for the market value survey are met. (3)\n\nThe required initial sample parcels are\nselected through a random selection process contained in the procedures for the\nappropriate market value survey. These procedures may provide for the\nsubstitution of alternative parcels for initial sample parcels. (4)\n\nSales may be used as provided in the\nprocedures for the appropriate market value survey. These sales must meet the\nrequirements in Subpart 8191-4 of this Title. These sales may either\nsupplement, or substitute for, the initial sample parcel selections as provided\nin the procedures for the appropriate market value survey. (d) Determination of the full value. (1)\n\nAs provided in the procedures for the\nappropriate market value survey, sales may be substituted for initial sample\nparcels. Large units and the remaining initial sample parcels are appraised, and sales may be used to supplement these appraisals, as provided in the\nprocedures for the appropriate market value survey. The appraisals reflect the\ncondition of the parcel on taxable status date of the measured assessment roll\nand the value of the parcel as of the valuation date of the market value\nsurvey. (2)\n\nThe estimated full\nvalue is determined using the appraised values and sale prices, along with the\ncorresponding assessed values of the properties from the measured assessment\nroll. (3)\n\nNothing herein prevents\nORPTS from either including, or deleting, appraisals or sales from the data\nused to estimate the full value. (e) The procedures for a particular market\nvalue survey may provide for use of one or more alternative methods of\nmeasuring the full value of an assessing unit or one or more classes within an\nassessing unit as provided in section\n8186-1.16\nof this Part.
