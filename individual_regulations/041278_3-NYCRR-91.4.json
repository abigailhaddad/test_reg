  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 91.4 - Index\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General\nprovisions. A single index for the credit account shall be chosen from among\nthe indices approved by the Superintendent of Banks pursuant to Part 334 of\nthis Title. The rate for the credit account may be based directly on the index\nvalues or on the index values plus or minus additional percentage points; provided, however, that variations in the rate shall correspond directly to\nmovements in the index. This Part imposes no requirement on creditors to place\nlimitations on the adjustment in the rates for the credit account, as such\nadjustment would otherwise be allowed by movements in the index. However, any\ncreditor which adopts limitations of any kind on changes in the rate shall\nprovide for equal limitations on both increases and decreases. Similarly, rate\nadjustments may be rounded to the nearest percentage point or fraction thereof\nas determined by the creditor, provided that rounding applies equally to\ndecreases and increases in rates. Subject to the rounding provisions, increases\nin the index need not be used at each rate calculation date but may be\naccumulated once to the next rate calculation date, but decreases in the index\nmust be reflected at each rate calculation date. (b) Changes in the index or changes in the\nspread between the index values and the actual rate charged. A creditor may\nprovide for a substitute index similar to the chosen index only in the event\nthat the initial index becomes unavailable. In any other case, if the creditor\nproposes to change the index used for the credit account or to change the\npercentage spread between the index values and the rate charged on the account, application in letter form for permission to do so must be made to the Banking\n\nBoard, and, in the case of approval for such change, a notification of the\nchange must be sent to customers at least 30 days prior to the change. In the\ncase of a change in the percentage spread between the index values and the\nactual rate charged, Banking Board permission need only be obtained where the\nchange would be adverse to the account customer. (c) Information and disclosures with respect\nto the history of the index. The disclosure shall identify the index and shall\ncontain a statement that past changes in the index are not necessarily\npredictive of future changes in the index. The retail seller shall provide the\nhigh and low figures for the index and the dates at which these levels were\nreached, for each of the three calendar years preceding the calendar year in\nwhich the credit account is opened or when a variable rate provision is added\nto an existing account. In addition, if a credit account is opened after August\n31st of any calendar year or a variable rate provision is added to become\neffective after August 31st of any calendar year, the disclosure shall include\nthe high and low figures for the index's performance through June 30th of that\nyear, and such disclosure may be used as the disclosure of the high and low in\nindex performance for the calendar year next preceding the calendar year in\nwhich the credit account is opened or a variable rate provision becomes\neffective, prior to March 1st of that year.
