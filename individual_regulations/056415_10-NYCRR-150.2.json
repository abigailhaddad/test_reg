  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 150.2 - Cornell university at ithaca\n\nState Regulations\n(a) [Application.] The rules and regulations hereinafter given, duly made and enacted in accordance with the provisions of sections 70, 71 and 73 of chapter 45 of the Consolidated Laws (Public Health Law), as amended by chapter 395 of the Laws of 1928, shall apply to all natural and artificial reservoirs on Fall Creek and to all watercourses and drainage areas tributary thereto or ultimately discharging into said reservoirs, these bodies of water being sources of the public water supply of Cornell University at Ithaca, Tompkins County, New York. (b) [Definitions.]\n(1)\n\nThe term reservoir wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to the impounding reservoir on Fall Creek, which is tributary to or which serves as a source of this public water supply and to any additional reservoir which may be constructed or used for the purpose of this public water supply. (2)\n\nThe term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and include every spring, pond (other than artificial reservoirs and filter basins), stream, ditch, gutter or channel of any kind, the waters of which, when running whether continuously or occasionally, eventually flow or may flow into the public water supply of Cornell University. (3)\n\nWherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a reservoir or from a watercourse is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (c) Privies adjacent to any reservoir or watercourse. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind, placed or used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta, shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 50 feet of any reservoir or 15 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University, except a properly constructed and operated sewage disposal plant as hereinafter set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) provided, however, that the property on which the privy, privy vault, pit or any other receptacle intended for the deposit of human excreta is built or is to be built, is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distance above named can be obtained within the limits of such property. (2)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle used or intended for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta and built on property which is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distance named in paragraph (1) of this subdivision cannot be obtained within the limits of such property shall be placed as far as possible from any reservoir or watercourse and specially constructed of masonry, concrete or metal to form a watertight receptacle from which no outward percolation can take place. Where removable watertight containers are provided, they shall be located as far as practicable from any reservoir or watercourse. All privies or receptacles referred to in this paragraph shall be constructed or installed only with the approval and under the supervision of the board of trustees of Cornell University and so located that the tops of such receptacles shall be above the highest known water level of the reservoirs or watercourses. (3)\n\nWhenever a privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind or any vessel, can or other container, used for either the temporary storage or the permanent disposal of human excreta, is specially constructed and made watertight and located nearer any reservoir or watercourse than the distances named in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, such receptacle shall be emptied at regular intervals and disinfected as often as may be necessary to maintain them in a proper sanitary condition and effectually to prevent any overflow. The work of emptying and disinfecting these receptacles shall be done under the supervision of or in accordance with the directions of the board of trustees of Cornell University and in such manner as to effectually prevent any pollution of the water supply of the university. (4)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or other receptacle which is not watertight, placed or used for the permanent deposit of human excreta, shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of any reservoir or within 50 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University. (5)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind, placed or used for the temporary storage of human excreta, located between the limiting distances prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distances prescribed by paragraph (4) of this subdivision, shall be arranged in such a manner that all excreta shall be received in a suitable watertight receptacle or removable container which shall be emptied as set forth in paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subdivision. (6)\n\nWhenever the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers become filled within six inches of the top, said receptacles or containers shall be emptied or removed and the contents disposed of as hereinafter provided in order to maintain the privy or receptacle in proper sanitary condition and effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal, the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transported from the privy or receptacle to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents or the removable containers while being transported be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises and the adjacent premises. (7)\n\nUnless otherwise specifically ordered or permitted by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers permitted under paragraph (5) of this subdivision shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits and covered with not less than 12 inches of soil in such a manner as effectually to prevent their being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at a distance of not less than 200 feet from any reservoir or 100 feet from any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University. (8)\n\nWhenever it shall be found that, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or owing to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local conditions, excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal may, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, be washed over the surface of the ground or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any reservoir or watercourse, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the said trench or place of disposal shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health. (d) Sewage, sink wastes, garbage, etc. (1)\n\nNo bath water, laundry wastes, sewage or other excremental matter from any water closet, privy, cesspool or other source, except the effluent from a properly constructed and operated sewage disposal plant, as hereinafter provided by paragraph (2) of this subdivision, shall be thrown, placed, led, conducted, discharged or allowed to escape or flow in any manner either directly or indirectly into any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University, nor shall any such liquid or solid matters be thrown, placed, led, conducted, discharged or allowed to escape or flow upon the surface of the ground or into the ground beneath the surface (except into watertight receptacles, the contents of which are to be removed as provided by paragraphs [6] and [7] of subdivision [c]) within 100 feet of any reservoir or within 50 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University. (2)\n\nNo sewage disposal plant, the effluent from which is to be discharged or allowed to flow directly or indirectly into Fall Creek or any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University, shall be constructed, enlarged, altered or put in operation until plans for the same have been approved and a permit issued by the State Commissioner of Health and a copy of the plans, as approved, filed with the board of trustees of Cornell University. (3)\n\nNo garbage, putrescible matter, kitchen or sink wastes, refuse or waste matter from any garage, dairy or cheese factory nor water in which milk cans, utensils, clothing, bedding, carpets or harness have been washed or rinsed nor any polluted water or liquid of any kind, except the effluent from a properly constructed and operated sewage disposal plant as provided by paragraph (2) of this subdivision, shall be thrown or discharged directly or indirectly into any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University nor shall any such liquid or solid refuse or waste matter be thrown or discharged upon the surface of the ground or into the ground beneath the surface (except into watertight containers, the contents of which are to be removed as provided by paragraphs [6] and [7] of subdivision [c]) within 25 feet of any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University. (4)\n\nNo clothing, bedding, carpet, harness, vehicle, receptacle, utensil nor anything that pollutes water shall be washed, rinsed or placed in any reservoir tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University. (e) Bathing, animals, manure, compost, etc. (1)\n\nNo person shall be allowed to bathe nor shall any animal or poultry be allowed to stand, wallow, wade or swim nor be washed or watered in any reservoir of the public water supply of Cornell University. No watering place shall be maintained in such a way as to pollute with muddy leachings or excremental matter any stream tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University. (2)\n\nNo stable for cattle or horses, no barnyard, hogyard, pigpen, poultry house or yard, no hitching place or standing place for horses or other animals and no manure pile or compost heap shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 25 feet of any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University and none of the above named objects or sources of pollution shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain where or in such a manner that the drainings, leachings or washings from the same may enter any reservoir or watercourse without first having passed over or through such an extent of soil as to have been properly purified, and in no case shall it be deemed that proper purification has been secured unless the aforesaid drainings, leachings or washings shall have percolated over or through the soil in a scattered, dissipated form and not concentrated in perceptible lines of drainage for a distance of not less than 25 feet from any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University. (3)\n\nNo human excreta and no compost or other matter containing human excreta shall be thrown, placed or allowed to escape into any reservoir or watercourse nor be placed, piled or spread upon the surface of the ground at any point on the watershed tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University, nor shall such human excreta or compost or other matter containing human excreta be buried in the soil unless covered with not less than 12 inches of soil or within a distance of 100 feet of any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University; and no manure or compost of any kind shall be placed, piled or spread upon the ground within a distance of 25 feet of any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of Cornell University.
