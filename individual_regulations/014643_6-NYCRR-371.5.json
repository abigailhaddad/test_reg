  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 371.5 - Exclusions/exemptions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) [\nReserved\n]. (b) Conditional exclusion for used, broken cathode ray tubes (CRTs) and\nprocessed CRT glass undergoing recycling. Used, broken CRTs are not solid wastes if they are managed\nin accordance with the following criteria. If the criteria are not met, the\nused, broken CRTs are solid waste, and hazardous waste if the definition of\nhazardous waste is met. (1)\n\nPrior to\nprocessing: these materials must be destined for recycling and the following\nrequirements met: (i) Storage. The broken\nCRTs must be either: (a) Stored in a building\nwith a roof, floor, and walls; or\n(b) placed in a container\n(\ni.e., a package or a vehicle) that is constructed, filled, and closed to minimize releases to the environment of CRT glass (including fine\nsolid materials or their constituents). (ii)\n\nLabeling. Each container in which the\nused, broken CRT is contained must be labeled or marked clearly with one of the\nfollowing phrases: \"Used cathode ray tube(s)-contains leaded glass\" or \"Leaded\nglass from televisions or computers.\" It must also be labeled: \"Do not mix with\nother glass materials.\"\n(iii)\n\nTransportation. The used, broken CRTs must be transported in a container\nmeeting the requirements of section\n371.4\n(j)(1)(i)\n(\nb\n) and 371.4(j)(1)(ii) of this Part. (iv)\n\nSpeculative accumulation and use\nconstituting disposal. The used, broken CRTs are subject to the limitations on\nspeculative accumulation as defined in section\n371.1\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Part. If they are used in a manner constituting disposal, they must comply\nwith the applicable requirements of section\n374-1.3\nof this Title instead of\nthe requirements of this subdivision. (v) Exports. In addition to the applicable\nconditions specified in subparagraph (1)(i) through (iv) of this subdivision, exporters of used, broken CRTs must comply with the requirements of\n40\nCFR\n261.39(a)(5)\nas\nimplemented by USEPA (see section 370.1[e] of this Title). (a) Notification of intent to export, required to be submitted to USEPA under\n40\nCFR\n261.39(a)(5)\n(see\nsection 370.1(e) of this Title), must also be submitted to the\ndepartment. (2)\n\nRequirements for used CRT processing: Used, broken CRTs undergoing CRT processing as defined in subdivision\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle must be managed in accordance with the following criteria: (i) Storage. Used, broken CRTs undergoing CRT\nprocessing are subject to the requirement of subparagraph (1)(iv) of this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nProcessing. (a) All activities specified in subparagraphs\n(ii) and (iii) of the definition of\nCRT processing\nin section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle must be performed within a building with a roof, floor, and walls; and\n(b) No activities may be\nperformed that use temperatures high enough to volatilize lead from\nCRT\n(3)\n\nProcessed CRT glass sent to CRT glass making or lead smelting: glass from used\nCRTs that is destined for recycling at a CRT glass manufacturer or a lead\nsmelter after processing is not a solid waste unless it is speculatively\naccumulated as defined in section\n371.1\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Part. (4)\n\nUse constituting\ndisposal: Glass from used CRTs that is used in a manner constituting disposal\nmust comply with the requirements of section\n374-1.3\nof this Title, instead of\nthe requirements of this subdivision. (c) Conditional exclusion for used, intact cathode ray tubes (CRTs) exported for recycling. Used, intact CRTs exported for recycling are not solid\nwastes if they meet the notice and consent conditions of subparagraph (j)(1)(v)\nof this section, and if they are not speculatively accumulated as defined in\nsection\n371.1\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Part. (d) Notification and recordkeeping for used, intact cathode ray tubes (CRTs)\nexported for reuse. CRT exporters who export used, intact CRTs for reuse must\ncomply with the notification and recordkeeping requirements of\n40\nCFR\n261.41\nas implemented by USEPA (see\nsection 370.1(e) of this Title). Notification of intent to export, required to\nbe submitted to EPA under\n40\nCFR\n261.41(a)\n(see section\n370.1[e] of this Title), must be submitted to the department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
