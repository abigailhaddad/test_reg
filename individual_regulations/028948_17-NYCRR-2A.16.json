  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2A.16 - Standardization of Location\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE Paragraph 10. INSERT the following paragraphs: Guidance: 06A Sign installations should be at least 200 feet apart\nwhere possible. 06B Where physical conditions limit visibility, the sign\nlocation should be suitably adjusted. Support: 06C As an example, a ground-mounted sign placed immediately\nbeyond an overpass may not be sufficiently visible. Placing the sign just\nbefore, or well beyond, the overpass could improve its visibility. Guidance: 09A Except on freeways, warning signs should generally take\nprecedence over regulatory and guide signs, with a warning message for a\ngreater hazard taking priority over one for a lesser hazard. Regulatory signs\nshould be next in importance, with the sign posting the most important\nregulation superseding others. Guide signs should normally be the lowest in\npriority, as their locations are generally more flexible than those for other\ntypes of signs. Community wayfinding and acknowledgment guide signs should have\na lower priority as to placement than other guide signs. Information of a less\ncritical nature should be moved to less critical locations or omitted. 09B On freeways, guide signs should have highest priority, followed by warning and regulatory signs. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2A.16\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
