Tit. 13 § 16.9 - Sources of distributions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Beginning November 1, 1963, all partnerships, corporations, trusts, joint ventures, associations and other\ngroups or entities, persons and offerors who were required heretofore since January 1, 1961 or who hereafter are required by article 23-A of the\n\nGeneral Business Law to file an offering statement under section 352-e thereof, or who have obtained an exemption therefrom under section 352-g of\narticle 23-A, or are granted such exemption hereafter, are hereby required to transmit to each of the then owners of securities of said issuer, who\nare residents of this State, at the end of each quarter thereafter of its respective fiscal year, but not later than 60 days from such date, a\nstatement to be known as a \"Source of Distribution Statement\", when such owners have been paid distributions from any source by such issuer for or\nduring such quarterly period, which shall indicate clearly to each investor in the manner and form set forth in form SD-1 issued by the\n\nAttorney-General: (1)\n\nWhether or not any payments of cash to any investors, partners, stockholders, etc., were made\nfrom any of the following sources, and the amounts thereof with full details: (i) borrowed monies (secured or\nunsecured); (ii)\nloans or additional contributions from officers or partners or other principals or\nagents thereof; (iii)\nproceeds from the sale, transfer, option, exchange or other disposition (including\ninvoluntary conversion and insurance proceeds) of property or other assets, contracts, etc. (including monies received as deposit on contracts, returnable and nonreturnable). In the determination of such \"proceeds\", deferred payments and purchase money mortgages should be treated on the basis\nof accepted installment accounting principles; (iv)\nfunds generated from operations, which funds should\nbe defined to include net income as ascertained through the use of standard accounting practices adjusted so that depreciation allowances are not\ntreated as an expense and payment of principal due on debt is deducted. However, in the case of motels, hotels, nursing homes, furnished apartment\nhouses and similar properties, personalty recurrently acquired for use in connection with real property should be deducted as an expense; (v) monies paid to the issuer by lessees or other obligors as a result of a transaction where rent or other\nobligations due are intended to be made primarily from the operations of a particular property or properties where the issuer or any principal of the\nissuer has a material direct or indirect interest in the lessees or obligors when it is known to the issuer or principal thereof that all or part of\nsuch monies emanated from sources other than recurrent business earnings of such obligors or lessees in connection with the operation of the\nparticular property or properties concerned. (2)\n\nIn the event any payments of distributions\nwere made solely from current or retained earnings (or similar classifications) for a prior fiscal or calendar year, the information required by\nparagraph (1) need not be given. In the determination of current or retained earnings for this purpose deferred payments and purchase money mortgages\nshould be treated on the basis of accepted installment accounting principles. (3)\n\nIn the preparation of\nthe information called for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above it may be assumed that such payments were made first from current earnings for the period\ninvolved to the extent available; secondly from retained earnings to the extent available; and thirdly from funds generated from operations to the\nextent available. In regard to distributions from sources in excess of funds generated from operations, the specific sources should be\ndetermined. (4)\n\nWhether during the aforesaid period of time there has been any material default by the\nissuer in payment of any mortgage, taxes, interests or other obligation or obligations on secured or unsecured debt. If not, no express\nrepresentation need be made. (5)\n\nWhether any reserve set up for a purpose other than the payment of\ndistributions to investors has been reduced or terminated by application of funds therein for purposes materially different from that for which said\nreserve was established. If not, no express representation need be made. (6)\n\nWhether the principal\nofficers or directors of the issuer have received any notice from any lessee or other person or firm of a material fact which may substantially\naffect future distributions. If not, no express representation need be made. (7)\n\nWhether any loans or\nadvances have been made to officers, partners, or directors of the issuer during the reporting period of time, indicating the authority upon which\nsuch monies were disbursed, and the full terms of such loans or advances. If not, no express representation need be made. (8)\n\nWhether any general partner, officer, director or other principal has pledged or collateralized any of his\nstock, shares or interests in the issuer during the reporting period of time. Any such general partner, director or other principal shall provide\nsuch information to the issuer not later than 30 days from the end of each quarter of the issuer's fiscal year. If no such pledge or\ncollateralization has taken place, no express representation need by made. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. &\nRegs.
