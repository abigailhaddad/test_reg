  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2376.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definition and\nnature of advisory opinions. An advisory opinion is a written statement, issued\npursuant to the provisions of this Part, applying the pertinent statutory and\nregulatory provisions of a tax administered by the Commissioner of Taxation and\n\nFinance to a specific set of facts. Advisory opinions are issued at the request\nof any person who is or may be subject to a tax or liability under the Tax Law\nor claiming exemption from such a tax or liability, and are binding upon the\ncommissioner for that person only. Advisory opinions may, in the discretion of\nthe commissioner, be issued to any non- taxpayer, including but not limited to\na local official, petitioning on behalf of a local jurisdiction, and the head\nof a State agency, petitioning on behalf of the agency. Advisory opinions will\nnot be issued to any person or entity acting on behalf of an unidentified or\nhypothetical person or entity. Advisory opinions are issued on behalf of the\ncommissioner by any person to whom the commissioner delegates this\nauthority. (b) Subjects on which\nadvisory opinions may be requested. A petitioner may request an advisory\nopinion about any tax or program administered by the commissioner. Taxes\ninclude not only those imposed under the Tax Law, but various other taxes, such\nas New York City's Personal Income Tax on Residents, the City of Yonkers'\nIncome Tax Surcharge on Residents and the City of Yonkers' Earnings Tax on\n\nNonresidents, as well as the sales and use taxes imposed by various localities\nthroughout the State. The School Tax Relief (STAR) rebate program is an example\nof a program administered by the commissioner. An advisory opinion may be\nrequested about a substantive question, such as whether a specific transaction\ngives rise to a tax liability, or a procedural one, such as whether withholding\nof income tax is required under specified circumstances. Advisory opinions may\nbe requested about questions arising in the course of an audit or an\nexamination of a tax return, or about questions relating to a taxpayer's claim\nfor refund, credit or reimbursement. They may also be requested about a\nhypothetical or projected future set of facts. (c) (1)\n\nAn\nadvisory opinion will not be issued where the petition for advisory opinion\nrelates to a pending question raised by the petitioner in: (i) a petition for a decision or\ndetermination by the Division of Tax Appeals pursuant to Part 3000 of this\n\nTitle, or any appeals therefrom; (ii)\na request for a conciliation conference\nand issuance of a conciliation order by the Division of Taxation's Bureau of\n\nConciliation and Mediation Services pursuant to Part 4000 of this Title, unless\nall of the parties to the conciliation conference consent to the issuance of an\nadvisory opinion; or\n(iii)\na\npetition for a declaratory ruling by the commissioner pursuant to section\n2375.3\nof\nthis Title. (2)\n\nAn\nadvisory opinion will not be issued about a matter for which a statutory notice\nhas been issued when the petition for advisory opinion is filed after the\nissuance of the statutory notice and the time period for filing a petition for\na decision or determination or requesting a conciliation conference as\ndescribed in subparagraphs (1)(i) and (ii) of this subdivision is still open or\nany proceeding commenced by the petitioner regarding the statutory notice is\nstill pending, except as provided in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision. The term statutory notice means any written notice of the commissioner that\nadvises a person of a tax deficiency, determination of tax due, assessment, or\ndenial of a refund, credit or reimbursement application, or of cancellation, revocation, suspension or denial of an application for a license, permit or\nregistration, where that notice gives the person a right to a hearing in the\n\nDivision of Tax Appeals. (3)\nA\npetitioner may withdraw a petition and timely use an alternative procedure. Draft advisory opinions prepared in response to petitions that are withdrawn\nmay be published as New York tax guidances when, in the opinion of the\ncommissioner, publication would provide guidance to other similarly situated\ntaxpayers (see section\n2375.7\nof this Title). (4)\n\nThe petitioner\nmay elect to reserve the right to apply for the Voluntary Disclosure and\n\nCompliance (VDC) program pursuant to Tax Law section 1700 with respect to the\nsubject of the advisory opinion request when submitting a petition for an\nadvisory opinion. If an audit or investigation begins while a petition for\n\nAdvisory Opinion is under consideration, the electing petitioner will not be\nprohibited from participating in the VDC program with regard to the subject of\nthe advisory opinion, however, the audit or investigation will proceed. If the\nelecting petitioner chooses to participate in the VDC program by then\nsubmitting an application, the department will extend to that petitioner the\nbenefits of the VDC program as long as the petitioner meets all other\nqualifications for the program.
