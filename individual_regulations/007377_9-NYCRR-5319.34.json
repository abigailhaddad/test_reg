  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.34 - Game selection process\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\npossible permutation or combination of game elements that produces a winning or\nlosing game outcome shall be available for random selection at the initiation\nof each play, unless otherwise denoted by the game. (b) After selection of the game outcome, a\ngaming device shall not make a variable secondary decision that affects the\nresult shown to the player. For instance, if the random number generator\nchooses an outcome that the game will be a loser, the game shall not substitute\na particular type of loser to show to the player, thus eliminating the\npossibility of simulating a near-miss scenario where the odds of the top award\nsymbol landing on the pay line are limited, but appear frequently above or\nbelow the pay line. (c) A gaming\ndevice shall use appropriate protocols to protect the random number generator\nand random selection process from influence by associated equipment that may be\ncommunicating with such gaming device. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5319.34\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 16, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 46, eff. 11/16/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
