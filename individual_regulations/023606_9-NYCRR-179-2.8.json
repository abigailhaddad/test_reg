  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 179-2.8 - Procedure of time allowance committees\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The file of each resident who is serving\nan indeterminate sentence and who is entitled to be considered for good\nbehavior allowance shall be considered at least once a year during the time of\nhis confinement. All jail and/or detention time and other credits against the\nsentence shall be calculated as part of the first one-year period. Where the\nincident leading to the credit occurs at a subsequent time, the credit shall be\ncalculated as part of the first year following the occurrence of such\nincident. (b) Irrespective of when\nthe last consideration of the file of a resident serving an indeterminate\nsentence occurred, the file of a resident shall be considered during the third\nmonth preceding the month of the earliest possible date he would be entitled to\nconsideration for parole or conditional or other release if that date depends\nupon the amount of good behavior allowance to be granted, based upon the\nassumption that he has earned all the good behavior allowances that can be\ngranted. In any case, where the annual review would occur within six months of\nthe review required by this section, the annual review need not be\nconducted. (c) Where a resident is\nserving a definite sentence of imprisonment with a term of one year or less, the committee shall review his file not more than six nor less than two weeks\nbefore the earliest possible date he would be entitled to release if he had\nearned all the good behavior allowances that can be granted. (d) The committee shall consider the entire\nfile of the resident and then shall decide upon a recommendation as to the\namount of good behavior allowance to be granted, applying the criteria set\nforth in sections 179-2.5 and\n179-2.6\nof this Subpart. Where the\ncommittee does not recommend granting the total good behavior allowance\nauthorized, they shall proceed as provided in section 179- 2.9 of this\n\nSubpart. (e) The committee shall\nnot recommend the granting of the total allowance authorized by law or the\nwithholding of any part of the allowance in accordance with any automatic rule, but shall appraise the entire facility experience of the resident and make its\nown determination. (f) The\ncommittee shall promptly report the results of its deliberations in writing to\nthe facility director. Such report shall set forth the committee's\nrecommendation of the good behavior allowance to be granted for the period\nunder consideration and the reasons for the recommendation. (g) Where a period of good behavior allowance\nhas been declared lost in a determination of a facility director's proceeding, such time shall be excluded from the amount the committee is authorized to\nrecommend for allowance, but on the last consideration to occur before the\nearliest parole or conditional or other release date, the committee shall\nconsider and set forth its recommendation as to whether the resident's\nsubsequent behavior merits restoration of all or part of the lost allowance and\nits reasons therefor. The committee shall evaluate the following factors in\ndetermining whether to restore the lost allowance: (1)\nthe number of facility director's\nproceedings held, the time span over which they occurred and the disposition of\neach; (2)\nthe misbehaviors for\nwhich the facility director's proceedings were held; (3)\nthe duration and recency of the\nmisbehavior free periods; and\n(4)\nthe resident's effort to change and the degree of change indicated. (h) Recommendations of the\ncommittee shall be pursuant to a decision of a majority of the members, but any\nmember who disagrees shall note his recommendations and the reasons therefor on\nthe report of the committee. Where a majority of the members are unable to\nagree upon a recommendation, the chairperson shall report such fact and each\nmember shall report his recommendation and his reasons in the report made by\nthe chairperson. (i) Where the time\nallowance committee has recommended an allowance which will extend the period\nof the resident's confinement beyond the earliest or any previously established\nrelease date, the resident shall be scheduled to reappear before the time\nallowance committee at a hearing in accordance with the direction of the\ndirector of the division.
