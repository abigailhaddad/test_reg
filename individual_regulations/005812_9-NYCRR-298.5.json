  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 298.5 - Financing and service charges\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Financing. (1)\n\nAn annual internal service\nfund appropriation is made by the State Legislature to the Office of General\n\nServices to provide funding for the SASP. (2)\n\nAll program expenditures and\ndisbursements of the SASP are made by the Office of Financial Administration as\napproved by OGS in accordance with FMR 102-37.55, 102-37.275 through\n102-37.285, 102-37.495, 102-37.500, 102-37.505 and Education Law section\n3712. (3)\n\nAll revenue generated by\nthe SASP through the assessment and collection of service charges is deposited\ninto this fund to annually offset all direct and reasonable indirect program\nexpenditures of the SASP. Service charge receipts from donees are accepted only\nin the form of organizational checks or official State vouchers, and are\ndeposited and credited by the Office of Financial Administration. (4)\n\nIn the event that funds from service\ncharges are received in excess of the total of all program expenditures, these\nfunds may be put in a reserve account for up to three previous years of\noperational expenses. Any subsequent service charges to donees will be reduced\nto the extent necessary to offset any excess income. If this three year amount\nis exceeded, we will lower the five percent service charge that is now in place\nto two percent until such a time that the reserve account is back to the three\nyear limit. (b) Service\ncharges. (1)\n\nService charges assessed by the\nSASP shall be fair and equitable in relation to all costs, both direct and\nindirect, incidental to each transfer and the service performed, and\nsubsequently necessary to be performed by the SASP. Service charges assessed by\nthe SASP, however, shall be adequate to assure full recovery of all costs\nannually incurred in the administration and operation of the SASP program. Service charges in general are assessed as per the following guidelines: (i) item screened in usable condition with a\nrealistic acquisition cost will be assessed with an approximate five percent\nservice charge; (ii)\nitems screened\nin usable condition with an unrealistic acquisition cost will be assessed with\nan approximate five percent service charge based on comparable acquisition\ncosts researched from the intranet. This could result in either a higher or\nlower service charge; (iii)\nitems\nscreened in new condition may be assessed a higher percent service charge -\nthis higher percent shall not exceed 10 percent; (iv)\nitems screened in poor condition, yet\nusable or repairable by a donee may be assessed a lower percentage service\ncharge; (v) items screened in poor\ncondition, yet requested by a donee for cannibalization purposes will be\nassessed a lower service charge not to exceed two percent; (vi)\nitems screened and requested which will\nrequire extensive transportation and handling costs by the donee may receive a\nlower service charge based on the normal five percent; (vii)\nitems screened and requested by schools\nor hospitals for educational purposes may be exempt or assessed a lower service\ncharge; and\n(viii)\nitems screened\nand requested by entities that service homeless provider programs will, at\nmaximum, be assessed only nominal fees. (2)\n\nTotal SASP costs to administer and\noperate the program include, but are not limited to, the following basic cost\nareas: (i) personnel costs, consisting of\nsalaries, wages, fringe benefits, and prorated OGS Human Resource Department\nrelated costs; (ii)\ntransportation\ncosts, including purchase, operations and maintenance of cars and\ntrucks; (iii)\ntelephone\ncommunications; (iv)\nadministrative\nand accounting costs; (v) printing\nand media distribution, including postage; (vi)\nsupplies and equipment, including\ncomputers, paper, tags, forms, etc.; (vii)\nvehicular insurance; and\n(viii)\ntravel expenses and per\ndiem. (3)\n\nThe source of\nfunding for the operations of the Bureau of Federal Property Assistance program\nis the service charge assessed to items of property that are distributed\nthrough the program. Therefore, the financing of the program is entirely\ndependent upon service charges which are paid by donee receiving the property. These charges are designed to cover expenditures of operating the unit. Recipients are responsible for arranging the pickup of items they are awarded\nand pay for all transportation, packing, crating, and handling related costs. Furthermore, these revenues may be used for but are not limited to the purchase\nof necessary equipment and supplies, maintaining a three year financial reserve\nand rehabilitation, repairing or replacing parts of Federal property. The\nprogram overhead includes but is not limited to general operating expenses of\nthe program such as screening cost, personnel, utilities/communications, fuel, compliance costs, accounting/billing, insurance, printing, data processing and\ndepreciation. These service charges are assessed on a fair and equitable basis\nto recover the program's monthly operating expenditures from the monthly\nproperty receipts unless the program is maintaining excessive operating\nreserves. If excessive operating reserves are developed, service charges will\nbe adjusted to meet the financial precepts as stated. (4)\n\nSince Public Law\n94-519\nallows for\ndifferent levels of service to be provided to the recipients of Federal\nproperty, the method of determining service charges varies depending on the\nlevel of service actually being provided to the recipient of the property. These general types of service levels are currently provided to the donee: (i) property specifically screened by the\ndonee's representatives and directly shipped to its location; and\n(ii)\nproperty directly shipped to the donee's\nlocation but not screened by the donee's representatives. (5)\n\nWhen the property is screened\nspecifically by donees, the cost would be for the document(s) processing charge\nat the time of donation transfer, plus any other direct costs to the SASP\nassociated with the property during its period of compliance. These direct\ncosts include but are not limited to transportation expense for the transfer, additional processing charges for item overages and field compliance\ninspections. The compliance inspections cost includes prorated program costs, transportation costs and other travel expenses incurred during the compliance\nreview(s). (6)\n\nIn the determination\nof the normal service charges, all of the direct charges associated with the\nobtaining of the property are assessed to each shipment of property. Upon final\ninspection of the property, these costs plus a representative portion of the\nprograms indirect costs are prorated among the individual items in the\nshipment. The basis of this proration is the current condition, value, fragility, quantity, anticipated future storage needs and the compliance\ncosts.Note: (7)\n\nThe above methods\nof financing the SASP activities and determining service charges are consistent\nwith the financial precepts of the SASP program which are: (i) each source of revenue is self-supporting\nand receives an equitable share of the total program overhead; (ii)\nfinancial reserves shall not exceed the\nthree previous years of operating expenses; (iii)\noperating expenses shall not exceed 15\npercent of the acquisition cost of the property received on an annual basis; and\n(iv)\nthe total service charge\nreceipts for any given calendar year will not exceed 15 percent of the original\ngovernment acquisition cost of the property donated. (c) Federal property inventory\nsystem. (1)\n\nAccountable items are those items\nof property with an original government acquisition cost or fair market value\nof $5,000 or more and any passenger vehicles. For all accountable items of\nproperty, comprehensive transactional records are maintained. (2)\n\nAs an operating unit of the Office of\n\nGeneral Services, the SASP is required to use generally acceptable accounting\npractices. An appropriation account is assigned to the program and is the\nofficial record of its financial activities. Expense transactions are processed\nusing the internal control system enacted by OGS. Purchases require preapproval\nby OGS' purchasing unit prior to SASP purchase. Payments are processed by OGS'\nclaims unit, following processes compliant with guidance established by the New\n\nYork State Comptroller's Office and the State Finance Law. (3)\n\nExceptions. Special or extraordinary\ncosts may be added to the appropriate service charge as follows: (i) Rehabilitation property. Direct costs for\nrehabilitating property. (ii)\n\nOverseas property. Additional direct costs for returning the property (from\noverseas bases). (iii)\n\nLong-haul\nproperty. Charges for major items with unusual delivery costs. Any such costs\nwhich are anticipated will be discussed with the donee prior to\nshipment. (iv)\n\nSpecial handling. For dismantling, packing, crating, shipping, delivery and other extraordinary\nhandling charges. (v) Screening. Extraordinary costs incurred in screening property. (4)\n\nMinimum service charges are assessed in\ncases where the State agency provides minimum services, and no other direct\ncosts are involved. They reflect the basic costs of document processing and the\nadministrative and overhead costs of the State agency, prorated by the number\nof documents processed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
