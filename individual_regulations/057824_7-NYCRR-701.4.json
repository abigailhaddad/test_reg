  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 701.4 - Inmate grievance resolution committee (igrc)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Composition. Pursuant to section\n139\nof the Correction Law, a facility's IGRC\nmust be a five-member body consisting of two voting inmates, two voting staff\nmembers, and a non-voting chairperson. The non-voting chairperson may be an\ninmate, staff member, or a volunteer associated with the facility's program. There shall be at least two alternate inmate representatives, two alternate\nstaff representatives, and four non-voting chairpersons in each facility. (1)\n\nFrom time to time, or prior to the\nestablishment of a new IGRC, the superintendent shall determine whether an\ninstitution's size warrants additional alternates or non-voting\nchairpersons. (2)\n\nThe IGP\nsupervisor supervises and coordinates the IGP activities of each inmate and\nstaff representative, clerk and chairperson. (b) IGRC inmate representatives and clerks. (1)\n\nMinimum qualifications. (i) An inmate must have completed high school\nor obtained a G.E.D. equivalency certificate to be eligible to function as an\nIGRC representative or clerk. (ii)\n\nAn inmate testing above the eighth grade level is eligible to participate as an\nIGRC representative or clerk as long as he or she is enrolled in one unpaid\nmodule of school and remains enrolled in school until a G.E.D. certificate is\nearned. (2)\n\nSelection of\ninmate representatives. The inmate representatives and alternates shall be\nelected by their peers. (i) The IGP\nsupervisor shall submit a nomination and election procedure for his/her\nfacility to the director, IGP, for approval. (ii)\n\nThe approved nomination and election\nprocedure shall be conspicuously posted five working days prior to nominations\nbeing held. (3)\n\nFilling\nvacancies between elections. (i) Alternate\ninmate representatives (those placing third or fourth in the most recent\nelection) will be used to fill vacancies between elections. (ii)\n\nWhen there is a need for additional\ninmate representatives or alternate representatives to complete a term until\nthe next regular election, the supervisor has the option of: exhausting the\nmost recent election list in numerical sequence for representatives; having the\ncurrent IGRC agree upon the appointment of a new representative who meets with\nthe approval of the superintendent; or holding another election. (4)\n\nInmate representative's\ntenure. An inmate representative's term shall be six months. Representatives\nwho are unseated will return to their former job assignments whenever feasible. However, leave of absence from a former job assignment may not exceed seven\nmonths. The inmate representative's position is a full-time assignment unless\notherwise authorized in writing by the director, IGP. (c) Removal of inmate representatives. (1)\n\nBefore an elected inmate representative\nor an inmate representative who has permanently replaced an elected\nrepresentative of the IGRC may be removed from his/her position on the\ncommittee or transferred to another facility, a limited due process hearing\nmust be held. When the inmate is served with the notice of charges, the notice\nmust indicate that the affirmation of these charges may result in removal from\nthe IGRC. This hearing may be a disciplinary Tier III hearing or an IGRC\nimpeachment hearing (procedurally the same as a Tier III hearing; see Part 254\nof this Title). The hearing determines whether or not the representative should\nbe removed from his/her representative position and for how long he/she should\nbe precluded from holding a representative position. Although other sanctions\nmay result from a disciplinary Tier III hearing, no other sanctions may result\nfrom an IGRC impeachment hearing. (2)\n\nIf an elected inmate representative or\ninmate representative who has permanently replaced an elected representative of\nthe IGRC requests a transfer out of his/her facility or reassignment to another\nprogram, the inmate must sign a resignation vacating the protection afforded\nthe representatives prior to realizing that transfer or reassignment. (3)\n\nIn order to prevent improper transfers of\nIGRC representatives, the following identification procedures must be followed: (i) The IGP supervisor or the superintendent\nshall notify the following within 24 hours of an inmate's election or\nappointment as an IGRC representative: (a) director of the IGP; (b) superintendent; (c) first deputy\nsuperintendent; (d) all deputy\nsuperintendents; (e) inmate records\ncoordinator; (f) review officer -\ndisciplinary. (ii)\n\nTo\nidentify an inmate as an IGRC representative and alert any reader that this\ninmate may not be transferred without a due process hearing, a conspicuous\nnon-permanent marker shall be attached to or provided for: (a) the guidance and counseling unit\nfolder; (b) the inmate records\ncoordinator's office folder/card; and\n(c) the disciplinary office. (iii)\n\nWhen an inmate is no longer\na full-time representative, the IGP supervisor or the superintendent is\nresponsible for notifying the individuals listed in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, and for removing the identifying marker from the locations listed in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, within 24 hours. (iv)\n\nIf an inmate representative's presence\nor conduct at a facility creates an emergency and transfer is immediately\nnecessary to protect the facility or its personnel, the superintendent shall\nnotify the superintendent of the receiving facility of the need to conduct the\nlimited due-process hearing as soon as practicable, shall provide the\nsuperintendent of the receiving facility with all documentation necessary to\nhold such a hearing and shall notify the director of the IGP, of the transfer. These actions shall be taken within 24 hours of the inmate representative's\ntransfer. (d) Staff IGRC representatives. Staff representatives and alternates shall be\nselected by the superintendent from an established list of personnel who have\nsuccessfully completed a training course designed specifically for individuals\nwho will be serving as IGRC representatives. In order for the IGP to function\neffectively and in accordance with specified time limits, the superintendent\nmust ensure that trained staff coverage is made available to the IGP. (e) Representatives' job duties. Both the\ninmate and staff IGRC representatives are responsible for the job duties\nenumerated in the IGP Training Manual under the supervision of the IGP\nsupervisor. (f) IGRC chairperson\nselection. Chairpersons for IGRC hearings shall be selected by the IGP\nsupervisor from a list submitted by the IGRC representatives. (g) Grievance clerks. (1)\nA grievance clerk and such additional\nclerks as may be needed shall be selected by the IGP supervisor after\nconsultation with the superintendent. (2)\n\nAt the conclusion of their IGP\nassignments, clerks will be reinstated to their former job assignments whenever\nfeasible. Clerks may be reasonably assured of reinstatement for a period of 12\nmonths. (3)\n\nThe clerks shall report\nto and take direction from the IGP supervisor. (4)\n\nIf the supervisor has personal knowledge\nor reliable information of adverse behavior on the part of a clerk, he/she\nshall recommend dismissal setting forth the reasons in writing to the\nsuperintendent. The superintendent shall forward a recommendation, accompanied\nby a copy of the supervisor's report, to the director of the IGP. The clerk\nwill be suspended pending the director's decision.
