Tit. 18 § 434.3 - Persons entitled to a hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A subject of a report of child abuse or\nmaltreatment has a right to a hearing pursuant to section\n422\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law to determine whether the record of the report in the\n\nStatewide Central Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment should be amended\nor, if the report was received by the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse\nand Maltreatment prior to February 12, 1996, amended or expunged on the grounds\nthat it is inaccurate or is being maintained in a manner inconsistent with\ntitle 6 of article 6 of the Social Services Law. The burden of proof at such\nhearing is on the office, appropriate local child protective service or the\n\nCommission on Quality of Care and Advocacy for Persons with Disabilities, as\nthe case may be. The issues at the hearing are: (1)\nwhether the subject has been shown by a\nfair preponderance of the evidence to have committed the act or acts of child\nabuse or maltreatment giving rise to the indicated report, where it has been\ndetermined at the administrative review that the act or acts of child abuse or\nmaltreatment giving rise to the indicated report would not be relevant and\nreasonably related to the employment of the subject by provider agencies or the\napproval or disapproval of applications which would be submitted by the subject\nto licensing agencies; or\n(2)\nwhether the subject has been shown by a fair preponderance of the evidence to\nhave committed the act or acts of child abuse or maltreatment giving rise to\nthe indicated report and, if there is a finding of a fair preponderance of the\nevidence, whether such act or acts are, based on guidelines developed by the\noffice, relevant and reasonably related to the employment of the subject by\nprovider agencies, or the approval or disapproval of applications which would\nbe submitted by the subject to licensing agencies. (b) Any person who has been informed by a\nlicensing or provider agency that he or she has been denied employment, discharged from employment, not used as a volunteer or not hired as a\nconsultant or informed that an application for a permit or license has been\ndenied based in whole or in part on the fact that such person is the subject of\nan indicated report of child abuse or maltreatment may request a hearing\npursuant to section\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law. The request for a hearing must be made within 90 days\nof the receipt of notice of denial of an application by a provider or licensing\nagency which indicates that the denial was based in whole or in part on the\nexistence of the indicated report. Any hearing requested under this paragraph\nmust be held within 30 days of the request unless the hearing is adjourned for\ngood cause shown. Any subsequent adjournment for good cause shown must be\ngranted only upon consent of the person who requested the hearing. At any such\nhearing, the sole question to be decided is whether the subject has been shown\nby a fair preponderance of the evidence to have committed the act or acts of\nchild abuse or maltreatment giving rise to the indicated report. In such\nhearings the burden of proof on the issue of whether an act of child abuse or\nmaltreatment was committed is upon the department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
