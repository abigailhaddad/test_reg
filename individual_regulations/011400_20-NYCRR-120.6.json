  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 120.6 - Credit against separate tax on the ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 620-A\n(a) General. A resident individual, estate or trust is entitled to a\ncredit under this section against the separate tax imposed by section\n603\nof the Tax Law on the ordinary income\nportion (or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution. This credit is allowable\nwith respect to any income tax imposed for the taxable year by another state of\nthe United States, a political subdivision of such state, the District of\n\nColumbia, or a province of Canada on such ordinary income portion (or part\nthereof) of a lump sum distribution which is derived from a business, trade, profession, occupation or from personal services as an employee within such\ntaxing jurisdiction and is subject to tax under section\n603\nof the Tax Law. (See subdivision [b] of\nthis section for the determination of income tax imposed by another\njurisdiction.) However, no credit is allowable under this section if no income\ntax is actually due to the other jurisdiction with respect to the ordinary\nincome portion (or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution. Further, no credit\nis allowable if the other jurisdiction provides an exemption of its income tax\non the ordinary income portion (or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution to\na New York State resident subject to the New York State separate tax on such\nincome. (b) Determination of income tax imposed by another jurisdiction. (1)\n\nWhere the ordinary income portion (or\npart thereof) of a lump sum distribution is subject to separate income taxation\nby another state of the United States, a political subdivision of such state, the District of Columbia, or a province of Canada, the amount of separate tax\nimposed on such income by such jurisdiction (reduced by any applicable credits\nof such jurisdiction, exclusive of prepayments) is the amount which constitutes\nthe income tax imposed on the ordinary income portion (or part thereof) of a\nlump sum distribution by such other jurisdiction. (2)\n\nWhere such ordinary income portion (or\npart thereof) of a lump sum distribution is not subject to separate income\ntaxation by such other taxing jurisdiction, but is included as income in\ndetermining the income tax imposed by such jurisdiction, the portion of such\nincome tax which constitutes the income tax imposed on the ordinary income\nportion (or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution is determined by\nmultiplying the entire income tax payable to the other taxing jurisdiction by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the ordinary income portion (or part\nthereof) of the lump sum distribution included in the income subject to tax by\nsuch jurisdiction and the denominator of which is all the income subject to\nsuch tax by such jurisdiction. See sections\n120.1\nthrough\n120.5\nof this Part for the resident credit allowable against ordinary tax for the\nbalance of the income tax imposed by such other taxing jurisdiction which does\nnot constitute the income tax imposed on the ordinary income portion (or part\nthereof) of a lump sum distribution. (c) Method of claiming credit. (1)\n\nIf a resident individual, estate or trust\nclaims a credit under this section for income taxes imposed by another\njurisdiction (determined in accordance with the provisions of subdivision [b]\nof this section), a completed New York State credit claim form must be attached\nto the New York State personal or fiduciary income tax return filed for the\ntaxable year. (2)\n(i) If two or more taxing jurisdictions (as\ndefined in this paragraph) impose income taxes on the same or different amounts\nof the ordinary income portion (or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution\nderived from sources within such other jurisdictions, a separate credit claim\nform must be completed for each jurisdiction for which credit is claimed and\nattached to the taxpayer's New York State personal or fiduciary income tax\nreturn. In order to determine the income tax imposed by another jurisdiction to\nbe reported on the separate credit claim forms, see subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nThe term\ntwo\nor more taxing jurisdictions\nas used in this section means any\ncombination of states (other than New York State), political subdivisions of\ndifferent states (other than both a state and one or more of its political\nsubdivisions as provided in subdivision [e] of this section), the District of\n\nColumbia, and provinces of Canada. (3)\n\nIf both a state (other than New York\n\nState) and one or more of the political subdivisions of such state impose\nincome taxes on the same or different amounts of the ordinary income portion\n(or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution derived from sources within such\nstate and one or more of its political subdivisions, the sum of such income\ntaxes imposed by the state and its political subdivisions (determined in\naccordance with the applicable provisions of subdivision [b] of this section)\nmust be reported on a single credit claim form. The single credit claim form\nmust be filed with the taxpayer's New York State personal or fiduciary income\ntax return. (d) Limitations. The amount of credit against the separate tax on the\nordinary income portion (or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution for income\ntaxes imposed by another jurisdiction on such income is subject to the three\nlimitations provided in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this subdivision. Where\ncredit is claimed against such separate tax for income taxes imposed on the\nordinary income portion (or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution by two or\nmore taxing jurisdictions as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of\nthis section, these three limitations must be applied separately to each\njurisdiction for each credit being claimed. See subdivision (e) of this section\nfor the limitations in cases where such credit is claimed for income taxes\nimposed by both a state and one or more of its political subdivisions on the\nordinary income portion (or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution. (1)\n\nThe credit allowable under this section\ncannot exceed the income tax imposed by another jurisdiction (as determined in\naccordance with the provisions of subdivision [b] of this section) on the\nordinary income portion (or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution. If a\ntaxpayer claims a credit against the separate tax in accordance with the\nprovisions of this section for the income tax or taxes (or any portion thereof)\nimposed by another jurisdiction on the ordinary income portion (or part\nthereof) of a lump sum distribution, and it is later determined that the amount\nof such tax or taxes (or the portion for which the credit was claimed) is more\nor less than the amount of credit claimed with respect to such tax or taxes on\nthe taxpayer's New York State personal or fiduciary income tax return, the\ntaxpayer (or fiduciary in the case of a fiduciary return) must file an amended\n\nNew York State return at the address indicated on the form and in the\ninstructions. (2)\n\nThe credit\nallowable under this section cannot exceed the amount obtained by multiplying\nthe separate tax due under section\n603\nof the Tax Law by a percentage\ndetermined by dividing the portion of the ordinary income portion of the lump\nsum distribution taxable both under section\n603\nof the Tax Law and by such other\njurisdiction (the numerator) by the total amount of the ordinary income portion\nof the lump sum distribution taxable under such section (the\ndenominator). (3)\n\nThe credit\nallowable under this section cannot reduce the separate tax due under section\n603\nof the Tax Law to an amount less than\nwould have been due if the part of the ordinary income portion of the lump sum\ndistribution taxable both under section\n603\nof the Tax Law and by such other\njurisdiction were excluded from the computation of the separate tax due under\nsuch section. (e) Limitations where credit is claimed under this section for income taxes\npaid to both a state and also to one or more of its political\nsubdivisions. Where both a state and one or more of its political\nsubdivisions impose income taxes on the same or different amounts of a resident\ntaxpayer's ordinary income portion (or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution\nderived from sources within such state and political subdivision (which income\nis also subject to the separate tax under section\n603\nof the Tax Law), the maximum credit\nallowable is the lowest of the amounts determined after computing the following\nthree limitations: (1)\n\nThe credit\ncannot exceed the total of the income taxes payable by such taxpayer to the\nother state and the other political subdivision or subdivisions on the ordinary\nincome portion (or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution (determined\nseparately for the other state and its subdivision [s] in accordance with the\nprovisions of paragraph [b][1] and/or [2] of this section and then combined). For notification of a change of income tax payable to the other state or a\nsubdivision thereof, see paragraph (d)(1) of this section. (2)\n\nThe credit cannot exceed the amount\nobtained by multiplying the New York State separate tax payable by the taxpayer\non the ordinary income portion (or part thereof) of a lump sum distribution by\nthe percentage determined by dividing the taxpayer's portion (or part thereof)\nof such income subject to taxation by such other jurisdiction (the numerator)\nby the taxpayer's portion (or part thereof) of such income subject to the New\n\nYork State separate tax imposed thereon by section\n603\nof the Tax Law (the denominator). Where\ndifferent amounts of the ordinary income portion (or part thereof) are subject\nto taxation by both the other state and by one or more of its subdivisions, the\nlarger amount of such income subject to tax by either the state or one or more\nof its subdivisions must be used in the numerator of this\ncomputation. (3)\n\nThe credit for the\ntotal income taxes paid by the taxpayer to both another state and one or more\nof its political subdivisions on the ordinary income portion (or part thereof)\nof a lump sum distribution cannot reduce the New York State separate tax\npayable under section\n603\nof the Tax Law to an amount less than\nwould have been due under such section if the ordinary income portion (or part\nthereof) of the lump sum distribution subject to taxation by the other\njurisdictions (or where different amounts of such income are subject to\ntaxation by the other jurisdictions, the larger of such amounts) were excluded\nfrom the ordinary income portion (or part thereof) of the lump sum distribution\nreported in accordance with section\n603\nof the Tax Law.
