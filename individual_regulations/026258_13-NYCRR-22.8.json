I am fully familiar with the provisions of Article 23-A of the General\n\nBusiness Law and the regulations promulgated by the Attorney General in Part 22. I prepared (or reviewed) all legal documents necessary to form an HOA\nand, in my opinion, the HOA is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing. [If the HOA is not in existence at the time the application is\nsubmitted, state that counsel will cause the HOA to be formed in conformity with applicable law.] I have prepared the application based on\ninformation from the sponsor. I expressly disclaim any responsibility to have made an independent inspection of the property or investigation of the\ninformation furnished to me by sponsor. I have no actual knowledge of any violation of Article 23-A of the\n\nGeneral Business Law or Part 22 of the regulations promulgated by the Department of Law, nor do I have actual knowledge of any material fact omitted\nor any untrue statement of a material fact included in the application.\"\n(vii)\nA check in the\namount required by General Business Law section 352-e(7)(a) made payable to the Department of Law.

(3)\n\nThe issuance of a no-action letter is based\nsolely on the information provided in the application. Any material misstatement or omission of material fact required by this Part may render the\nno-action letter void\nab initio. (4)\n\nThe issuance of a no-action letter shall not be\nconstrued to be a waiver of or limitation on the Attorney General's authority to take enforcement action pursuant to article 23-A of the General\n\nBusiness Law and other applicable provisions of law except as expressly stated in such letter. (5)\n\nThe\nissuance of a no-action letter by the Department of Law shall have no value as precedent and may not be relied upon in the submission of any other\napplication for such letter.
