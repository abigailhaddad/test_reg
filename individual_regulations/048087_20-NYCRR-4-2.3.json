  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-2.3 - Receipts from rents and royalties\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A(3))\n(a) (1)\n\nReceipts from rentals of real and tangible personal property located in New\n\nYork State are included in New York receipts. 100% of receipts from rentals of\nreal and tangible personal property are included in everywhere\nreceipts. (2)\n\nReceipts from rentals\ninclude all amounts received by the corporation for the use of or occupation of\ntangible personal property or real property, whether or not such property is\nowned by the corporation. (3)\n\nGross\nreceipts from real and tangible personal property that is subleased from the\ncorporation must be included in the BAF. (4)\n\nThe amount of receipts from the rental of\nmotor vehicles and other rolling stock, such as trucks or construction\nequipment, included in New York receipts is the product of such receipts and a\nfraction. Such fraction may be based on miles operated in New York State\ncompared to total miles operated, time operated in New York State compared to\ntotal time operated, number of pickup and delivery locations in New York State\ncompared to the total of such locations, or any other method that fairly\napportions such receipts to New York State. 100% of the receipts from the\nrental of motor vehicles and other rolling stock, such as trucks or\nconstruction equipment, are included in everywhere receipts. Omnibus operations\nwhile engaged in school bus operations must be disregarded in computing the\namount of New York receipts and everywhere receipts. (5)\n\nExamples. Example 1: Corporation W receives $20,000 from its\ncustomer to provide transportation by omnibus from a location in New York State\nto a location outside of New York. Such transportation is not for school bus\noperations. 25% of the miles traveled by Corporation W's omnibus are in New\n\nYork, 5 miles in New York State out of a total 20 miles. Corporation W must\ninclude $5,000 in New York receipts (25% x $20,000). $20,000 is included in\neverywhere receipts. Example 2: Corporation X receives $500 from customer A\nand $300 from customer B for short-term automobile rentals. Customer A picks up\nthe automobile at Corporation X's New York location and returns it to such\nlocation. As both the pickup and return locations are in New York State for\ncustomer A, the $500 from customer A is included in New York receipts and\neverywhere receipts. Customer B picks up the automobile at Corporation X's New\n\nYork location but returns it to Corporation X's location outside of New York\n\nState. As half of the pickup and return locations are in New York State, half\nof the receipts from customer B, $150, is included in New York receipts and\n$300 is included in everywhere receipts. Corporation X has a total of $650 of\n\nNew York receipts, $500 from customer A and $150 from customer B. It has $800\nin everywhere receipts, $500 from customer A and $300 from customer B. (b) (1)\n\nReceipts from the use in New York State\nof patents, copyrights, trademarks, licenses, and similar intangibles are\nincluded in New York receipts. 1 0 0 % of receipts from the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, licenses, and similar intangibles are included in\neverywhere receipts. (2)\n\nThese\nreceipts include, but are not limited to: (i) all amounts received by the corporation for the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks, licenses, and similar intangibles, whether or not such patents, copyrights, trademarks, licenses, and similar intangibles were issued to or are\nowned by the corporation and whether or not characterized as royalties; and\n(ii)\namounts received from the\nuse of copyrights for audio works, audiovisual works, visual works, graphic\nworks, or games by whatever means delivered. (3)\nA patent, copyright, trademark, license, and similar intangible is used in New York State to the extent that the\nactivities generating the fees paid for the use of the patent, copyright, trademark, license, or similar intangible are carried on in New York State. If, after exercising due diligence, the corporation lacks sufficient information in\nits books and records to determine where the activities are carried on, it may\nuse a reasonable method to estimate such location based on third party\ninformation (if available) or population. (4)\n\nExamples. Example 1: Network Corp sells a license to broadcast its\nnetwork to Cable Corp for a set fee. Under the licensing agreement, Cable Corp\nis allowed to bundle Network Corp's network with other content and sell the\nbundle to individual subscribers for a monthly fee set by Cable Corp. Even\nthough the content is digitally delivered to Cable Corp by Network Corp, the\ndelivery means is incidental to the sale of a license to distribute, broadcast\nor sublicense. As such, Network Corp's receipts are apportioned under this\nsection to the location where the license is used, which is presumed to be the\nlocation where the network is available for viewing. Network Corp's books and\nrecords indicate the location of Cable Corp's viewers. The amount of New York\nreceipts is determined by multiplying such receipts by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the number of subscribers in New York State and the\ndenominator of which is the total number of subscribers within and without New\n\nYork State. Example 2: Network Corp sells a license to distribute its\nmovie to Streaming Corp for a set fee. Under the licensing agreement, Streaming\n\nCorp is allowed to add the movie to its library of movies and other programming\noffered by the streaming service. Streaming Corp sells monthly subscriptions to\nview all of its content to individual viewers for a fee set by Streaming Corp. Although the movie is digitally delivered by Network Corp to Streaming Corp, the means of delivery is incidental to the sale of a license to distribute, broadcast or sublicense the movie. As such, Network Corp's receipts are\napportioned under this section to the location where the license is used, which\nis presumed to be the location where the movie is available for viewing. If\n\nNetwork Corp's books and records do not indicate the location of Streaming\n\nCorp's viewers, it must use a reasonable method to approximate the subscriber\nlocation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
