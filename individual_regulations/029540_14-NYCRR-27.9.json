  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 27.9 - Surgery and certain other treatments\n\nState Regulations\n\nElectro-convulsive therapy, surgery, major medical\ntreatment or the use of experimental drugs or procedures may be administered to\nany patient only upon the informed consent of the patient or of a person\nauthorized to act on his or her behalf after a full and comprehensive\ndisclosure of potential benefits and the potential of harm. Aversive or noxious\nstimuli shall not be included as part of any patient's individual service plan\nunless all conditions for obtaining consent as otherwise set forth in this\nsection are met. Before such stimuli may be included in any service plan, such\nprocedures shall be evaluated by a suitable committee responsible for reviewing\nand approving the efficacy and humaneness of this element of the patient's\nservice plan. Patients are presumed to have sufficient mental capacity to give\nconsent unless there are facts and substantial reasons to the contrary. The\nfollowing conditions shall apply: (a) If a patient is under 18 years of age, consent shall be obtained from the\nparents or legal guardian. If no parent or legal guardian is available or if\nsuch a patient having mental capacity to understand the procedure objects or\none of the parents objects to the proposed procedure, the director may not\ninitiate the procedure without a court order authorizing it, except in the case\nwhere surgery is indicated by significant danger to life or limb of the patient\nif the procedure is delayed. (b) If\na patient is 18 years or older but in the opinion of the chief of the service\ndoes not have sufficient mental capacity to give consent, authorization for the\nprocedure in question must be obtained from the spouse, a parent, an adult\nchild, or a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this section shall\nprevent the director from giving consent to surgical procedure under emergency\nconditions where there appears to be significant danger to life or limb of the\npatient if the procedure is delayed. (c) If a patient is 18 years or older and has\nsufficient mental capacity to give consent, the procedures may be initiated\nonly with the patient's consent. The patient shall have the right, upon his or\nher request, to have a person of her or his choice present when consent is\nsought. In cases where a patient withholds consent to a procedure necessary for\nprotection of life or limb, the director shall notify the Mental Health\n\nInformation Service and may apply for court authorization. (d) If it is not clear that the patient has\nsufficient mental capacity to give consent, an independent opinion about the\npatient's mental capacity must be obtained from a qualified consultant who is\nnot an employee of the facility. After considering the opinion of the\nconsultant, the director will decide whether the patient does or does not have\nthe capacity to give consent and the director may then proceed in accordance\nwith the other provisions of this section. The director shall enter in the\npatient's clinical record the reasons for this decision. (e) Each facility director shall develop\nstandard procedures to evaluate the decisions made on the mental capacity of\nindividual patients to give consent. A qualified consultant who is not an\nemployee of the facility shall be a member of the review process. (f) All patients who object shall have\nrecourse to the procedures for objection and appeal stipulated in section\n27.8\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
