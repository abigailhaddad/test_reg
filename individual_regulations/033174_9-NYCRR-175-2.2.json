A juvenile delinquent may be\ntransferred if his behavior indicates that he is exceptionally dangerous to\nhimself, to other youth or staff members in the facility, or to persons in the\ncommunity. Exceptionally dangerous behavior may include, but is not limited to: serious intentional assaults on other persons, sexual assaults on other youth\nor setting fires; or\n(b) the\njuvenile delinquent has demonstrated by a pattern of behavior at the school or\ncenter that he needs a more structured setting.
