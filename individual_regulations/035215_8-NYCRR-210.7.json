  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 210.7 - Supplemental relocation payments\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to other payments and benefits authorized by\n\nState law, individuals and families displaced from dwellings on real property\nacquired by the commissioner and on which title vested in the State on or after\n\nMay 14, 1970, are entitled to supplementary relocation payments in accordance\nwith the following criteria and eligibility standards. (a) Owner-occupant (over one year). (1)\n\nEligibility. (i) The owner-occupant must have owned and\noccupied the dwelling for at least one year immediately prior to the start of\nnegotiations for the acquisition of such. This time is calculated from the date\nof the first contact at which a money offer is extended to the owner for the\nacquisition of the property, or the delivery of the 90 day notice of the\n\nState's intention to acquire the property, whichever occurs later. (ii)\n\nThe owner-occupant displaced must have\nactually resided in the dwelling for this one year eligibility\nperiod. (iii)\n\nThe building owned\nand occupied is limited to a one, two or three family dwelling. (iv)\n\nThe owner-occupant must have purchased\nand occupied a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling within one year\nsubsequent to the date on which he was required to move from the dwelling unit\nacquired. (v) The date required to\nmove is here defined, and elsewhere in this section as the date of title\nvesting in the State plus 90 days, or the date of surrender of possession of\nacquired improvements, whichever occurs later. (2)\n\nComparability standards.If the above\nbasic eligibility standards are met, the owner-occupant is eligible for a\nsupplemental relocation payment not to exceed $5,000, representing the\ndifference between the acquisition price paid or approved by the State and the\namount necessary to purchase a comparable decent, safe and sanitary dwelling as\ndefined in section\n210.2\nof this Part. A comparable\ndwelling is one which, when compared with the dwelling being taken, is\nsubstantially equal regarding all major characteristics and functionally\nequivalent with respect to: the number of rooms; the area of living space; the\nsame type of construction; age; state of repair; same type of neighborhood; equally accessible to public services and places of employment and is adequate\nto accommodate the displaced owner and is available on the private\nmarket. (3)\n\nCalculation of\npayments.The average price of a comparable dwelling, shall be established by\none of the two following methods: (i) For\nlarge projects: a locality-wide study developing the average market selling\nprice of various classes of comparable dwelling units. The average prices\nderived from such a study shall be used in establishing a schedule of payments\nto owner-occupant. (ii)\n\nIn lieu of\nthe above method, the State may make a determination on an individual parcel\nbasis by selecting comparable dwellings meeting, as far as possible, the above\ndefined comparability criteria. The arithmetic average of the probable selling\nprices of the comparable dwellings selected shall be used in establishing the\namount of supplement payment. (4)\n\nSpecial computation for supplemental\nrelocation payments to rural property owners.In sparsely settled rural areas\nwhere it is not feasible or possible to establish the average price of a\ncomparable dwelling by either the locality-wide or individual comparable basis, one of the following methods may be used at the option of the commissioner: (i) If other housing is available in the area\n(that is comparable except that it is not decent, safe and sanitary), the\nsupplementary relocation payment may be determined by estimating the cost to\ncorrect the decent, safe and sanitary deficiencies, adding this amount to the\nprobable selling price of the replacement housing which is not decent, safe and\nsanitary, and comparing this amount with the amount paid the relocatee for his\ndwelling together with an area of land typical in size for a rural homesite in\nthe general area. (ii)\n\nWhen there\nis no other housing available in the area and the owner elects to retain his\ndwelling which is not decent, safe and sanitary, the supplemental relocation\npayment may be determined by estimating the amount paid for the dwelling at the\npresent location together with an area of land typical in size for a rural\nhomesite in the general area and deducting this amount from the estimated\nselling price of the dwelling, corrected to decent, safe and sanitary\nstandards, on a comparable rural homesite. (iii)\n\nWhere there is no other housing\navailable for comparison and the owner elects to retain and move a decent, safe\nand sanitary dwelling, the supplemental relocation payment may be determined by\nestimating the amount paid for the dwelling at the present location together\nwith an area of land typical in size for a rural homesite in the general area\nand deducting this amount from the estimated selling price of the dwelling\nrelocated on a comparable rural homesite. (iv)\n\nThe maximum supplemental relocation\npayment allowable under any of the circumstances mentioned in this subdivision\nis $5,000. (5)\n\nSelling\nprices.All calculations or supplemental relocation payments are to be\npredicated on the probable selling prices of the available comparable housing, not the asking prices. (6)\n\nInspections of replacement dwelling.In order to be eligible for and receive the\nsupplemental relocation payment, the owner-occupant must purchase and occupy a\ndecent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling. The replacement dwelling must\nbe inspected by representatives of the commissioner and a determination made\nthat it meets the standards for decent, safe and sanitary housing as defined in\nsection\n210.2\nof this Part. In any\napplication for supplemental relocation payments under this section, the\nindividual or individuals or family must attest that, to the best of his or\ntheir knowledge and belief, the replacement dwelling meets the standards for\ndecent, safe and sanitary housing as defined in section\n210.2\nof this Part. (7)\n\nPurchase of \"comparable\" dwelling not\nrequired.The displaced owner-occupant is not required to purchase a\n\"comparable\" dwelling to qualify for supplemental relocation payments. Comparability is used as a standard in determining the amount to which he is\nentitled for supplemental relocation payments. In any event, any dwelling\npurchased must be decent, safe and sanitary in order to qualify for\npayment. (b) Owner-occupant (90 days but under one year); tenants, owner-occupant electing\nnot to repurchase. (1)\n\nEligibility. (i) Persons claiming eligibility under these\nprovisions must have lawfully occupied the dwelling acquired for at least 90\ndays prior to initiation of negotiations for such property. This time is\ncalculated from the date of the first contact with the owner of the property at\nwhich a money offer is extended for the acquisition of the property, or the\ndate of delivery of the 90 day notice to the State's intention to acquire the\nproperty, whichever occurs later. (ii)\n\nPersons otherwise eligible under this\nsection must rent or purchase a dwelling unit that meets the standards of\ndecent, safe and sanitary housing in order to qualify for a supplemental\nrelocation payment. (2)\n\nThe maximum payment authorized under (b) of this section for an owner-occupant\n(90 days but under one year), tenants and an owner-occupant electing not to\nrepurchase is $1,500. (i) In calculating such\nsupplemental relocation payments for a tenant, the specific payment is the\ndifferential between the amount necessary to rent a decent, safe and sanitary\ndwelling unit for the next two years minus 24 times the amount of rent paid for\nthe last month immediately before being required to move, or 24 times the\neconomic rent of the dwelling, whichever is the lesser. Economic rent shall be\nestablished by the State's appraisal process. Where rent is being paid to a\n\nState or political subdivision thereof, economic rent shall be used in\ndetermining the amount of payment of which the relocatee is entitled. When a\ndisplaced individual rents only a sleeping room and is otherwise eligible, the\nsupplemental relocation payment not to exceed $1,500 shall be based on the rent\nfor a comparable sleeping room. The standards for decent, safe and sanitary\nhousing shall also apply. (ii)\n\nIn\ncalculating such supplemental relocation payments for an owner-occupant who is\nnot eligible for payment because he had not actually owned and occupied his\ndwelling for at least one year prior to the acquisition of that property by the\n\nState or has elected not to purchase a new property, the payment shall be\ncalculated as follows: the difference between the cost of renting for the next\ntwo years a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling adequate to accommodate him and\nhis family in an area not generally less desirable in regard to public\nutilities and commercial facilities than the area from which he was displaced, and 12 percent of the acquisition price of the property acquired, not exceeding\n$1,500. (iii)\nA person eligible for\nsupplemental relocation payments under (b) of this section who elects to make a\ndown payment on a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling is entitled to receive the\namount necessary to make the down payment, up to a maximum of $1,500. The\namount \"necessary\" for such down payment is based on the amount that the\nrelocatee would have to pay if the purchase of replacement housing was financed\nby a conventional loan. (c) Owner-occupant: prohibition on double\npayments. If an owner-occupant eligible for the maximum of $5,000 payment\nelects initially not to repurchase a replacement dwelling, but rather to claim\nbenefits on the two year rent differential basis, he cannot receive double\npayment in excess of $5,000 if he later decides (within the allowable period)\nto purchase a replacement house. The amount of any payment made on the rent\ndifferential basis is to be deducted from the calculated differential necessary\nto purchase a replacement dwelling. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
