Tit. 18 § 368.13 - Determination of continuing eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A recipient of AABD shall complete and\nsign a certification of need (Form DSS-1229) and shall submit such form by mail\nor in person at least once a year. The determination of continuing eligibility\nshall include reconsideration of all variable factors of need and eligibility. Particular attention shall be given to any changes in coverage or amounts of\nbenefits, such as disability insurance payments, retirement and disability\nannuities, veterans' compensation and pensions and workmen's compensation, and\nto any change in the contributions or ability to contribute of legally\nresponsible relatives. (b) Change\nof residence or absence from the district of administration. When a recipient\nleaves the district of administration the agency shall determine if such\nabsence is temporary or permanent and shall determine its continuing\nresponsibility for the recipient. (c) Reclassification of blindness. (1)\n\nWhere medical treatment or surgery may\nhave resulted in the partial restoration of vision of a blind recipient, a\nreexamination may be indicated. The report of such examination of Form DSS-542\nshall be submitted to the Commission for the Visually Handicapped for\nreclassification. (2)\n\nWhere an eye\ncondition of a recipient who has not been classified as blind, increases in\nseverity, or a recommendation of a review team or other evidence raises a\npresumption of blindness, an eye examination shall be completed to determine\nwhether or not the recipient is legally blind. (d) Permanent and total disability. Periodic\nredetermination and recertification of permanently and totally disabled status\nshall be made in accordance with department regulations and procedural\ninstructions. (1)\n\nFor Group I cases, the\nstatus of permanently and totally disabled shall not be considered a factor\nsubject to change. Therefore, the determination of continuing eligibility shall\nbe made by the agency without new medical evidence and without referral again\nto the review team unless new medical or social evidence indicates improvement\nor recovery. (2)\n\nFor Group II\ncases, the status of permanently and totally disabled shall be considered a\nvariable factor of eligibility and shall be subject to redetermination for\ncontinuing eligibility certification by the review team each 12 months unless\nprior to the recall date there is evidence of change in the person's\ncondition.
