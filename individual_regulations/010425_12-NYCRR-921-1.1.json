  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 921-1.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nAs used in this Part (rule), Act shall mean the New York\n\nState Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act (article 25-A of\nthe New York State Labor Law). Additionally, the terms have the following\nmeanings: (a) Affected employee means\nan employee, whether full-or part-time, who, at the time notice is required to\nbe given, may reasonably be expected to experience an employment loss as a\nresult of a proposed plant closing, mass layoff, relocation, or covered\nreduction in hours by the employer and is therefore entitled to notice. The\nterm affected employee also includes employees who will likely lose their jobs\nbecause of bumping rights or other factors, to the extent that such individual\nemployees reasonably can be identified at the time notice is required to be\ngiven. The term affected employee includes a managerial and supervisory\nemployee, but does not include an officer, director, shareholder, member of an\nLLC, or business partner with a 10 percent or greater ownership interest, or a\nconsultant or contract employee who has a separate employment relationship with\nanother employer and is paid by that employer or who is\nself-employed. (b) Consolidation of\nall or part of a business means the combining of two or more branches, units, divisions, or like parts of an employer's business operations. (c) Date of layoff means the last day an\nemployee is eligible or permitted to work for their employer. The fact that an\nemployer continues to pay an employee after the date of the layoff does not\nchange the employee's employment status for purposes of this Part. Payments to\nan employee subsequent to the date of layoff, whether continuing to pay an\nemployee's normal weekly wage, or for severance pay, vacation pay, personal\nleave, and other similar benefits, shall not extend the employee's date of\nlayoff. (d) Days means calendar\ndays. (e) Employer. (1)\n\nEmployer means any business enterprise, whether for-profit or not-for-profit, that employs 50 or more employees (see\nparagraph (7) of subdivision (e) of this section) within New York State, excluding part-time employees, or 50 or more employees including part-time\nemployees within the state that work in aggregate at least 2,000 hours per\nweek. For purposes of this Part: (i) The\ncalculation of total weekly hours shall include overtime hours earned on a\nregular basis; (ii)\n\nOvertime hours\nearned on a regular basis shall mean any overtime hours worked by an employee\nwhen such employee has worked overtime in seven or more weeks out of the twelve\nweeks immediately prior to the date upon which notice was required under the\n\nAct. (2)\n\nIndependent\ncontractors, and subsidiaries that are wholly or partially owned by a parent\ncompany, may be treated as separate employers depending on the degree of their\nindependence from the parent. Some of the factors to be considered in making\nthis determination include, but are not limited to: (1)\ncommon ownership; (2)\ncommon directors and/or\nofficers; (3)\nde facto exercise of\ncontrol; (4)\nunity of personnel\npolicies emanating from a common source; and\n(5)\nthe dependency of operations. (3)\nA receiver, trustee, debtor-in-possession, or other fiduciary, where those terms are applicable\nunder the provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (Title 11 of the United States\n\nCode), or any other provision of federal or state law where such party is\nresponsible for continuing operations of the business entity, is considered an\nemployer under this Part. (4)\n\nWhere\na client-employer of a professional employer organization (PEO) has worksite\nemployees under article 31 of the Labor Law, such employees, with the exception\nof the client-employer's officers, directors, shareholders or partners, are\nemployees of the client-employer for purposes of this Part. (5)\n\nAn employer may have one or more sites of\nemployment under common ownership or control. (6)\n(i) The\nterm employer shall not include the federal or state government or any of their\npolitical subdivisions, including any unit of local government or any school\ndistrict, any public authority, public benefit corporation, board, or\ncommission, or any federally recognized Indian tribal government. (ii)\n\nPrivate for-profit and not-for-profit\nbusinesses contracting with such exempted governmental entities are\nemployers. (7)\n\nNumber of\nemployees: In reaching a determination whether an employer meets the threshold\nof 50 employees for purposes of establishing coverage as an employer under this\nrule: (i) All individuals employed at a\nsingle site of employment, including individuals who work remotely but are\nbased at the employment site, other than part-time employees, are counted as\nemployees for purposes of determining coverage as an employer. (ii)\n\nIndividuals on temporary layoff or on\nleave who have a reasonable expectation of recall, other than part-time\nemployees, are counted as employees. An employee has a reasonable expectation\nof recall when the employer can demonstrate that it notified the employee that\ntheir employment has been temporarily interrupted and that the employee will be\nrecalled to the same or a similar job, or when the employee is notified through\nindustry practice. (iii)\n\nThe point\nin time at which the number of employees is to be measured for the purpose of\nestablishing coverage is the date the first notice is required to be\ngiven. (f) Employment loss. (1)\n\nThe term employment loss\nmeans: (i) An employment termination, other\nthan a discharge for cause, voluntary departure, or retirement; (ii)\nA mass layoff, as defined in subdivision\n(i) of this section, that exceeds six months in duration; or\n(iii)\nA reduction in hours of work of more\nthan 50 percent during each month of any consecutive six-month period: (a) For either: (1)\n\nAt least 25 employees constituting at\nleast 33 percent of the employees at the site (excluding part-time employees); or\n(2)\n\nAt least 250 employees\n(excluding part-time employees) regardless of whether they comprise 33 percent\nof the employees at the site (excluding part-time employees). (b) For purposes of this\nprovision, a reduction in hours of work shall not be deemed to have occurred\nduring any week that the employee is receiving unemployment insurance benefits\nas a partial wage replacement for lost hours of work through the employer's\nparticipation in a shared work program under Title 7-A of article 18 of the New\n\nYork Labor Law, provided however, that should the employer become aware at any\npoint during its participation in the shared work program that an employment\nloss not subject to this exception will occur, the employer shall provide as\nmuch notice of the employment loss as is practicable accompanied by a statement\nof the basis for reducing the notice period. (c) For purposes of this provision, the\nconsecutive six-month period shall begin with the first month in which the\nemployee experiences a reduction of more than 50 percent and shall continue for\na period of 26 weeks beginning with the first week in which there was a\nreduction in hours compared with the previous week. (d) For purposes of this provision, a\ntemporary layoff is a mass layoff with a duration of less than a consecutive\nsix-month period and a planned return of employees after the layoff period\nends, which will not be deemed to be subject to the notice requirements set\nforth in this Part. A permanent layoff is a mass layoff that extends beyond a\nconsecutive six-month period for which the employer must comply with the notice\nrequirements in this Part from the time of the employment loss. (iv)\nA plant closing as defined in\nsubdivision (m) of this section affecting 25 or more employees, excluding\npart-time employees. (v) A\nrelocation as defined in subdivision (n) of this section affecting 25 or more\nemployees, excluding part-time employees. (2)\n\nAn employee does not suffer an employment\nloss while the employee is reassigned or transferred to an employer-sponsored\nprogram, such as retraining or job search activities, as long as the\nreassignment does not constitute a constructive discharge or other involuntary\ntermination, or otherwise trigger an employment loss as set forth\nabove. (3)\n\nEmployment loss shall\ninclude a plant closing, mass layoff, covered reduction in work hours, or\nrelocation that is a result of a bankruptcy filing or the sale of a business\n(see subdivision\n921-2.1\nof section (b) of this\n\nPart). (g) Facility\nmeans a building or other location in which the business operations of an\nemployer takes place. (h) Hours of\nwork shall generally mean the average hours of work per week for each employee\nduring the previous calendar year. If the employee did not work for at least 90\ndays during the previous calendar year, hours of work shall mean the average\nhours of work per week for the 90-day period prior to the date on which notice\nwas due. Overtime hours will be included, if applicable, as described in\nsubdivision (e)(1) of this section. (i) Mass layoff means a reduction in\nworkforce that: (1)\n\nIs not the result of a\nplant closing; and\n(2)\n\nResults in\nan employment loss at a single site of employment during any 30-day period, beginning on the date of the first employment loss, for either: (i) At least 25 employees (excluding\npart-time employees) constituting at least 33 percent of the employees at the\nsite (excluding part-time employees); (ii)\n\nAt least 250 employees (excluding\npart-time employees) regardless of whether they comprise 33 percent of the\nemployees at the site. (j) Merger means a combination of all or part\nof the business operations of two separate employers. (k) Operating unit means an organizationally\nor operationally distinct product, operation, or specific work function within\nor across facilities at a single site of employment. (l) Part-time employee means an employee who\nis employed for an average of fewer than 20 hours per week or who has been\nemployed for fewer than six of the 12 months preceding the date on which notice\nis required. Part-time employees for purposes of this Part may include\nemployees who have worked full-time for fewer than six of the 12 months\npreceding the date on which notice is required. In determining whether an\nemployee worked an average of fewer than 20 hours per week, the shorter of the\nactual period the employee was employed or the 90 day period immediately prior\nto the date on which the notice is required shall be used. (m) Plant closing means the permanent or\ntemporary shutdown of a single site of employment, or one or more facilities or\noperating units within a single site of employment, if the shutdown results in\nan employment loss during any 30-day period at such site for 25 or more\nemployees, excluding any part-time employees. An employment action that results\nin the effective cessation of production or of the work performed by a unit, even if a few employees remain, is a shutdown. A temporary shutdown triggers\nthe notice requirement if the minimum number of terminations, layoffs exceeding\nsix months, or reductions in work hours constitute an employment loss under the\n\nAct. (n) Relocation means the\nremoval of all or substantially all of the industrial or commercial operations\nof an employer to a different location fifty miles or more away from the\noriginal site of operation where 25 or more employees, excluding part-time\nemployees, suffer an employment loss. For the purposes of this Part, relocation\nof substantially all of the operations of an employer shall include the\nrelocation of an entire unit, product line, division or other segment of the\nemployer's operation. (o) Employee\nrepresentative means an exclusive representative of employees within the\nmeaning of section 9(a) or 8(f) of the National Labor Relations Act\n(29 U.S.C. 159(a), 158(f)\n), section\n2 of the Railway Labor Act (45 U.S.C. 152\n), or the New York\n\nLabor Relations Act (New York Labor Law sec. 700 et seq.). Where an event\nrequiring notice occurs at an employment site involving employees represented\nby more than one bargaining unit, notice must be sent to each bargaining unit\nrepresenting employees affected by the plant closing, mass layoff, relocation\nor covered reduction in work hours. (p) Single site of employment. (1)\n\nFor the purposes of this Part, the\nfollowing shall apply to the determination of whether an employment loss\ninvolves a single site of employment: (i) Several single sites of employment within a single building may exist if\nseparate employers conduct activities within the building. For example, an\noffice building housing 50 different businesses will contain 50 single sites of\nemployment. (ii)\nA single site of\nemployment may refer to either a single location or a group of contiguous\nlocations in proximity to one another even though they are not directly\nconnected to one another. For example, groups of structures which form a campus\nor industrial park or separate facilities across the street from one another\nowned by the same employer may be considered a single site of\nemployment. (iii)\n\nSeparate\nbuildings or facilities which are not physically connected or are not in\nproximity to one another may be considered a single site of employment if they\nare in reasonable geographic proximity, are used by the employer for the same\npurpose, and share the same staff or equipment. Where an employer has two\nseparate locations in the geographic area and the purpose of one location is to\nsupport the operations of the other location, and this support requires travel\nbetween the two locations, the two locations will be considered a\nsingle-site. (iv)\n\nContiguous\nbuildings occupied by the same employer that have separate management, produce\ndifferent products or provide different services, and have separate workforces\ndo not constitute a single site of employment. (v) Non-contiguous sites in the same\ngeographic area that have separate management, produce different products or\nprovide different services, and have separate workforces do not constitute a\nsingle site of employment. (vi)\n\nThe\nsingle site of employment for employees whose primary duties require travel\nfrom point to point, who are out-stationed, or whose primary duties involve\nwork outside any of the employer's regular employment sites (e.g., railroad\nemployees, bus drivers, salespersons), shall be the site to which they are\nassigned as their employer's home base, from which their work is assigned, or\nto which they report. (q) Local board means a Local Workforce\n\nInvestment Board as defined by the Workforce Investment Act, or a Local\n\nWorkforce Development Board as defined by the Workforce Innovation and\n\nOpportunity Act, or any similar local workforce board defined under a federal\nlaw which amends or supersedes the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act or\nits successors.
