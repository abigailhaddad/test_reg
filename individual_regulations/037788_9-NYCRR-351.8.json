  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 351.8 - Interstate and intrastate transfer cases\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf a probationer requests an interstate or an intrastate\ntransfer of supervision during the term of probation, the probation department\nshall adhere to applicable state law governing interstate or intrastate\ntransfer, the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision or the\n\nInterstate Compact for Juveniles and their respective governing rules, where\napplicable, and additional regulatory requirements set forth in Part 349 of\nthis Title with respect to the Interstate and Intrastate Transfer of Probation\n\nSupervision for Adults and Juveniles. A review of the probationer's compliance\nwith conditions of probation and his/her progress in meeting the goals of the\ncase plan should be considered before a transfer is recommended or initiated. For criminal court cases, where a probationer is granted permission to move or\ntravel outside the court's jurisdiction, he/she shall sign a written waiver of\nextradition agreeing to waive extradition proceedings where such proceedings\nare the result of the issuance of a warrant by the court pursuant to Criminal\n\nProcedure Law section 410.40(2), based upon an alleged violation of probation. Where an interstate case has been accepted for supervision by another state, the contact requirements herein shall be satisfied through the rules of the\napplicable Interstate Compact and the supervision requirements of the receiving\nstate until such time as a return or retaking.
