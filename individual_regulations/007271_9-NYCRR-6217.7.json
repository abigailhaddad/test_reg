The NYSVoter system shall allow all\ninformation associated with the registration to be viewed by the \"to\"\ncounty. (f) NYSVoter shall notify\nthe \"from county\" if a voter has moved their voter registration between\ncounties. In such cases, the \"from county,\" upon determining that such records\nare for the same voter, shall cancel the voter record in their county and\nprovide the required cancellation notice to the voter pursuant to Election Law, section 5-402. I n such cases where the \"from county\" is unable to determine\nthat the proposed duplicate records are from the same voter, after providing\nthe required notice to the voter, the \"from county\" shall place such voter in\ninactive status. (g) NYSVoter shall\nfacilitate the move process if the \"to county\" has been informed of the\nregistrant's \"from county\" on the voter registration form or from the\nregistrant. (h) The moving of voters\nfrom one county to another may occur as a result of a new voter registration\nform being processed or by any mechanism provided for in Election Law §\n5-208. (i) Applicable to Transfers. Any board of elections which receives information that a voter has moved to an\naddress in another county in New York State which would have permitted such\n\"from county\" board to transfer the voter registration address within the\ncounty if the address indicated was an in-county change of address, shall send\na copy of the address transfer information, including a voter registration\nnumber to the \"to county\" board of elections where the voter has moved. The \"to\ncounty\" shall, using such voter's information contained in NYSVoter, including\nenrollment and signature exemplar, along with the new address information, place the voter at the new address pursuant to Election Law § 5-208 and provide\nnotice to the voter in the manner provided in this section. When the \"from\ncounty\" forwards transfer information to another county board of elections for\nfurther processing, the \"from county\" shall send a confirmation notice in a\nform approved by the State Board to the prior address of such voter in the\n\"from county.\" Further list maintenance steps as required by this Part shall be\nundertaken upon notification by NYSVoter that the voter is registered at an\naddress in another county in New York or upon notification received from the\nvoter. (j) If such registration or\nchange of address information effectuating such transfer also reflects a change\nof enrollment as evidenced by the NYSVoter record, the \"to county\" Board of\n\nElections shall also treat such as an application for a change of enrollment\npursuant to Election Law 5-304.
