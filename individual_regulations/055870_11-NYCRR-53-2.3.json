If you are healthy enough to qualify as a \"standard\" risk, premiums would likely have been lower if you had applied for a fully underwritten policy.\"\n(2)\n\nSuch prominent notice may be included as part of a sales illustration summary, if such summary is adopted by the insurer as the preliminary information. (b) Policy summary.
