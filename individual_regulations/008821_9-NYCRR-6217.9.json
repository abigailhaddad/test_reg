Tit. 9 § 6217.9 - Voter registration status\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each voter maintained in NYSVoter will be\nassigned a voter registration status by the county board which will determine\nthe voter's eligibility to vote. The voter registration status will be updated\nafter an application is processed and an application disposition has been\nassigned. The discreet voter registration statuses and their definitions to be\nstored by NYSVoter are described below. (1)\n\nActive. The voter is properly registered and is eligible to vote in elections. There are several categories of active voters, as specified below: (i) active; (ii)\nactive miliary; (iii)\nactive UOCAVA; (iv)\nactive special presidential; and\n(v) active special\n\nFederal. (2)\n\nInactive. The voter is still eligible to vote in elections, but is not included in the\npoll book. NYSVoter shall allow a county election official to designate a voter\nas inactive, noting the reason for the designation, such as \"election material\nmailed to registrant returned as undeliverable\" or \"moved with an out of county\nforwarding address\", \"affidavit ballots\". (3)\n\nPurged. The voter is no longer eligible\nto vote in an election, and will not appear in the list of registered voters.
