  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 240-2.8 - Specific procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Model\nevaluation and selection: (1)\nNYSDOT shall\nconsult with involved agencies to select the air quality model inputs and\nparameters to use for MPO transportation plan and TIP conformity\ndeterminations; (2)\nNYSDOT shall\nconsult with the department, USDOT, and EPA to select the air quality models\nand parameters to use for regionally significant project conformity\ndeterminations and hot spot analyses; (3)\naffected MPOs and NYSDOT shall develop\nprocedures for transportation models and transportation inputs and parameters\nin consultation with the department, affected local air and transportation\nagencies, USDOT, and EPA; and\n(4)\nthe department shall select air quality models and develop non-transportation\nrelated inputs and parameters used to develop the emissions budget in the\napplicable SIP revision during the SIP revision process in consultation with\ninvolved agencies. (b) Regional significance and significant project changes. The affected MPOs and\nNYSDOT shall, in consultation with the department, determine which\ntransportation projects, other than exempt projects, constitute regionally\nsignificant projects. Where the regional significance of a project is in\nquestion, the following criteria shall be considered by the involved agencies\nto evaluate whether the project is regionally significant: (1)\n\nThe following list includes, but is not\nlimited to, thresholds which shall be used to foster concurrence between MPOs, the department and NYSDOT as to whether the subject project constitutes a\nregionally significant project: (i) highway/roadway projects: (a) new\nconstruction on new alignment of roadways classified as principal arterial or\nhigher, one mile or longer; (b) widening of principal arterials or higher class roads to provide additional\nthrough-traffic lanes one mile or longer in total; (c) widening of roadways classified as\nprincipal arterial or higher to provide a new continuous turn lane, two miles\nor longer, or affecting five or more signalized intersections; (d) widening or reallocation of lane use by\nhigh occupancy vehicles (HOVs) or as a high occupancy toll (HOT) lane on\nroadways classified as principal arterials or higher, one mile or\nlonger; (e) additional\ngrade-separated ramps or new interchanges on roadways classified as principal\narterials or higher; and\n(f) widening or changes, as indicated above in clauses (a) through (e) of this\nsubparagraph, to any roadway determined by the MPO to serve regional\ntransportation needs (e.g., minor arterial or higher classification), and\nincluded in the MPO's regional transportation forecasting model. If a regional\ntransportation forecasting model is not used, widening or changes, as indicated\nabove in clauses (a) through (e) of this subparagraph, on any roadway that has\nbeen determined by the MPO or NYSDOT, through the interagency consultation\nprocess, to serve regional transportation needs. (ii)\ntraffic signalization projects: (a) coordination or upgrade of signal systems\non roadways classified as principal arterials or higher, encompassing at least\n10 signalized intersections and at least 2.5 miles of highway; (b) coordination and upgrade of traffic\nsignal systems on facilities indicated in clause (i)(f) of this paragraph for\nhighways or roadways, encompassing at least 10 signalized intersections and at\nleast 2.5 miles of highway; (iii)\ntransit/rail projects: (a) new passenger rail or bus service and\nextensions of existing service, five miles or longer, including new rail\nstations and new or expanded rail/bus connections to provide new regional\ntransit service; (b) purchase of\nadditional (not replacement) rolling stock to support increased frequency and\nhigher ridership; (c) new or\nexpanded exclusive park-and-ride facilities resulting in at least 100 new\nparking spaces; (iv)\nother projects: (a) automated toll collection\nfacilities (electronic toll and traffic management or automatic vehicle\nidentification) with impacts on regional travel; (b) transportation system improvements using\nintelligent transportation system (ITS) technologies that affect regional\ntravel on a daily or routinely recurring interval; (v) air quality or emissions impact. Any\ntransportation project that the commissioner of the department identifies, after consultation with NYSDOT and the affected MPO, as having the potential to\naffect air quality on a regional basis. (2)\n\nAffected MPOs and NYSDOT shall, in\nconsultation with the department, determine which minor arterials and transit\nprojects, if any, have the principal purpose of serving regional transportation\nneeds. Such minor arterials and transportation projects shall be included in\nthe regional emissions analysis as required in this Part. (3)\n\nThe MPO shall, in consultation with the\ndepartment and NYSDOT, determine which projects, based on information provided\nby the project sponsor, have undergone a significant change in design concept\nand scope from the MPO transportation plan and MPO TIP. (4)\nNYSDOT shall, in consultation with the\nappropriate affected local transportation and air agencies, make the\ndeterminations required under paragraphs (1)-(3) of this subdivision for\narterials and projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas outside MPO\nboundaries. (5)\n\nIn the event that\nthe department, NYSDOT, and the affected MPOs cannot reach agreement as to\nwhich projects are regionally significant, the matter shall be resolved in\naccordance with the procedures in section\n240-2.9\nof this Subpart. (c) Procedures for the evaluation\nof certain exempt projects. (1)\n\nThe affected\nMPOs and NYSDOT shall, in consultation with the department, determine which\nexempt projects under\n40 CFR\n93.126\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title) and\n40 CFR\n93.127\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this\n\nTitle) should be treated as non-exempt due to significant emissions\nimpacts. (2)\nNYSDOT shall, in\nconsultation with the department and affected local air and transportation\nagencies, make the determination required under paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision for projects in nonattainment and maintenance areas outside MPO\nboundaries. (d) Timely\nTCM implementation. (1)\nNYSDOT, the\ndepartment, and the affected MPOs shall cooperatively determine: (i) whether TCMs specifically identified in\nthe applicable SIP revision are being implemented as scheduled; (ii)\nwhether State and local agencies with\nthe appropriate authority are giving maximum priority, consistent with\n40 CFR\n93.113\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this\n\nTitle), to approving or funding of TCMs specifically identified in the\napplicable SIP revision; and\n(iii)\nwhether delays in implementing TCMs specifically identified in the applicable\nSIP necessitate revision of the SIP. (e) Procedures for projects in\nPM\n10\nand/or PM\n2.5\nnonattainment\narea. (1)\n\nThe lead conformity agency shall\ndetermine through interagency consultation if projects located in\nPM\n10\nand/or PM\n2.5\nnonattainment\nareas require a quantitative PM\n10\nand/or\nPM\n2.5\nhot-spot analysis in accordance with\n40\nCFR\n93.123(b)(1)\n(see Table\n1, section 200.9 of this Title). (f) Procedures for notification of MPO\ntransportation plan or MPO TIP amendments adding or deleting only exempt\nprojects. (1)\n\nEach affected MPO shall\ndetermine, in consultation with NYSDOT, whether MPO TIP or MPO transportation\nplan amendments solely concern the addition or deletion of exempt projects\nlisted in\n40 CFR\n93.126\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title) and\n40 CFR\n93.127\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this\n\nTitle). (2)\nNYSDOT shall make the\ndetermination required under paragraph (1) of this subdivision for projects\noutside MPO boundaries in nonattainment or maintenance areas. (3)\n\nThe department, NYSDOT, USDOT, EPA and, as appropriate, affected local air and transportation agencies, shall be\nnotified in writing of any determinations made pursuant to this subdivision\nwithin 30 days of such determination. (g) Procedures for events triggering new\nconformity determinations. NYSDOT shall, in consultation with the department\nand affected MPOs, identify instances when new conformity determinations are\nrequired, in addition to those determinations required by\n40 CFR\n93.104\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this\n\nTitle). (h) Procedures for\ntransportation activities crossing MPO or nonattainment areas boundaries. NYSDOT, in consultation with the department and affected MPOs, shall coordinate\nemissions analyses where a non-exempt transportation project crosses the border\nof nonattainment or maintenance areas or MPO boundaries. (i) Nonattainment or maintenance areas not\nentirely included in a single MPO boundary. (1)\nNYSDOT shall make, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Part, air quality analyses in nonattainment or maintenance\nareas that do not include any MPO boundaries. (2)\nNYSDOT shall make, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Part, air quality analyses in nonattainment or maintenance\nareas which are not entirely included in MPO boundaries. The results of any\nregional emissions analysis outside the MPO boundary shall be coupled with the\nMPO analysis for the remainder of the nonattainment or maintenance area, as\nappropriate, to allow a conformity determination based on the entire\nnonattainment or maintenance area. (3)\n\nIf more than one MPO is within the same\nnonattainment or maintenance area, NYSDOT shall coordinate the conformity\ndeterminations, in accordance with the provisions of this Subpart. (j) Isolated rural nonattainment or\nmaintenance areas. In isolated rural nonattainment and maintenance areas, NYSDOT shall coordinate, in accordance with the provisions of this section, the\npreparation of conformity determinations and air quality analysis. As required\nby\n40\nCFR\n93.109(l)\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title), the conformity analysis to be used must be\ndetermined through consultation with all involved agencies. (k) Consideration of regionally significant\nprojects that are not FHWA/FTA projects. (1)\n\nThe affected MPOs and NYSDOT, as appropriate, shall work with the department to\nidentify regionally significant projects that are not FHWA/FTA projects so that\nproper project information is included in the regional emissions analysis. The\nMPO shall solicit the necessary information from agencies that are recipients\nof Federal funding under title\n23 U.S.C. or the Federal Transit Act for any\nregionally significant projects, regardless of the project funding source, in\nconjunction with MPO transportation plan and MPO TIP updates. In non-attainment\nand maintenance areas outside of MPO boundaries, NYSDOT shall solicit such\ninformation. (2)\n\nIf during the\npublic participation process, or interagency consultation process, other\nregionally significant projects are identified, or there are changes in the\ndesign concept and scope of a regionally significant project that would affect\nthe air quality analysis, the NYSDOT or affected MPO shall appropriately refine\nthe conformity analysis in accordance with the provisions of this\nsection. (l) Criteria and\nprocedures: Localized CO, PM\n10, and\nPM\n2.5\nviolations (hot-spots). (1)\n\nThe FHWA/FTA or regionally significant\nproject must not cause or contribute to any new localized CO, PM\n10, and/or PM\n2.5\nviolations, increase the frequency or severity of any existing CO, PM\n10, and/or PM\n2.5\nviolations, or\ndelay timely attainment of any NAAQS or any required interim emission\nreductions or other milestones in CO, PM\n10, and\nPM\n2.5\nnonattainment and maintenance areas. This\ncriterion is satisfied without a hot-spot analysis in\nPM\n10, and PM\n2.5\nnonattainment and\nmaintenance areas for FHWA/FTA or regionally significant projects that are not\nidentified in\n40\nCFR\n93.123(b)(1)\n(see Table\n1, section 200.9 of this Title). This criterion is satisfied for all other\nFHWA/FTA or regionally significant projects in CO, PM\n10, and PM\n2.5\nnonattainment and maintenance areas if it is\ndemonstrated that during the time frame of the transportation plan no new local\nviolations will be created and the severity or number of existing violations\nwill not be increased as a result of the project and the project has been\nincluded in a regional emissions analysis that meets applicable requirements in\n40 CFR\nsections\n93.118\nand/or 93.119 (see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title). The demonstration must be performed according to\nthe consultation requirements in section 242-2.8 of this Part and the\nmethodology requirements of\n40\nCFR\n93.123\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of\nthis Title). (2)\n\nThis paragraph\napplies for CO nonattainment areas as described in\n40\nCFR\n93.109(f)(1)\n(see Table\n1, section 200.9 of this Title). Each FHWA/FTA or regionally significant\nproject must eliminate or reduce the severity and number of localized CO\nviolations in the area substantially affected by the project. This criterion is\nsatisfied with respect to existing localized CO violations if it is\ndemonstrated that during the time frame of the transportation plan (or regional\nemissions analysis) existing localized CO violations will be eliminated or\nreduced in severity and number as a result of the project. The demonstration\nmust be performed according to the consultation requirements of section 242-2.8\nof this Part and the methodology requirements of\n40\nCFR\n93.123\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of\nthis Title). (m) Criteria\nand procedures. Compliance with PM\n10\nand\nPM\n2.5\ncontrol measures. The regionally significant\nproject must comply with any PM\n10\nand\nPM\n2.5\ncontrol measures in the applicable implementation\nplan. The project-level conformity determination must contain a written\ncommitment from the project sponsor to include in the final plans, specifications, and estimates for the project those control measures (for the\npurpose of limiting PM\n10\nand\nPM\n2.5\nemissions from the construction activities and/or\nnormal use and operation associated with the project) that are contained in the\napplicable implementation plan. (n) Research and data collection and transportation model development. The affected\nMPOs shall consult with NYSDOT, the department, and affected local air and\ntransportation agencies before formally adopting initiatives related to\nresearch and data collection efforts in support of regional transportation\nmodel development. (o) Provision of\nfinal documents. (1)\n\nThe affected MPOs shall\nprovide a final copy of the MPO transportation plans, MPO TIPs and associated\nMPO transportation plan and MPO TIP conformity determinations with pertinent\nsupporting materials to involved agencies. (2)\nNYSDOT shall provide a final copy of\nprogram of transportation projects conformity determinations with pertinent\nsupporting materials for nonattainment or maintenance areas outside MPO\nboundaries to the involved agencies. (3)\n\nThe department shall provide a final copy\nof all applicable SIP revisions and pertinent supporting materials to involved\nagencies. (4)\n\nIn the event that the\nfinal documents and supporting materials to be provided pursuant to this\nparagraph are excessively voluminous, the agency providing such documentation\nmay provide a list of pertinent supporting documents necessary to analyze the\nfinal materials. Upon request the agency shall make the documents\navailable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
