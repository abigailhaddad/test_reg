(j) A continuing care retirement community shall not make any investment unless authorized or approved by its board of directors or a committee thereof responsible for supervising or making such investment. The committee's minutes of such authorization or approval shall be recorded and a report of such investment activity submitted to the board of directors at its next meeting for ratification. (k) Assets supporting reserve liabilities on the actuarial balance sheet included in the actuarial study shall consist of the assets specified in subdivisions (a), (c) and (e) of this section, except that the aggregate value of these assets need not exceed the minimum reserve liability determined pursuant to section\n350.3\nof this Part.

(l) A continuing care retirement community shall not convert an asset that is eligible to support reserve liabilities into an asset that at the time of investment is not eligible to support reserve liabilities except pursuant to section\n350.7\n(d) of this Part. (m) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a continuing care retirement community may retain, and need not divest itself of, an investment that was permissible under this Part as of December 31, 2017 and the asset shall be eligible to support the reserve liabilities on the actuarial balance sheet of the actuarial study.
