  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 368.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn October 1990 the Federal Older Workers' Benefit Protection\n\nAct (hereinafter \"OWBPA\") was signed into law. OWBPA essentially requires the\nelimination of certain aged-based discriminatory distinctions in death benefits\nprovided by employers. OWBPA applies to death benefits payable by the\n\nRetirement System on account of all deaths which occurred on or after October\n16, 1992 and all disability retirement benefits which became effective on or\nafter such date. OWBPA does not mandate specific death or disability benefit\ncalculation formulas. Rather it provides conceptual guidelines under which such\ncalculation formulas must comply. Accordingly, in order to bring the Retirement\n\nSystems' death benefit calculation structures into compliance with OWBPA, it\nwas first necessary to review and analyze the several death and disability\nbenefit provisions of the Retirement and Social Security Law and the provisions\nof OWBPA. This was necessary in order to assess the extent and manner in which\nthe Retirement and Social Security Law benefit provisions were violative of\nOWBPA and the manners in which the benefit formulas/structures could be changed\nin a manner which would satisfy the requirements of OWBPA and fulfill the\n\nComptroller's fiduciary responsibilities as Trustee of CRF. In furtherance of the Comptroller's intention to bring the\n\nRetirement Systems' death benefit structure into compliance with OWBPA, the\n\nComptroller, in 1992, commissioned Buck Consultants, Inc. (hereinafter \"Buck\")\nto analyze such death benefit structure to determine whether and to what extent\nsuch structure violated OWBPA. Under this engagement, Buck was also asked to\nrecommend the best approaches to amending the benefit structure to comply with\nOWBPA in a manner consistent with the Comptroller's fiduciary responsibilities\nas Trustee of CRF. The results of Buck's efforts were summarized in a document\nentitled \"Report on the Impact of the Older Workers' Benefit Protection Act on\nthe New York State and Local Employees' and Fire Retirement Systems\"\n(hereinafter the \"Buck Report\") issued on January 18, 1993. The Buck Report\ncontained a recommendation as to how the Retirement System's death benefit\nstructure should be revised so as to comply with OWBPA. Under article 5, section 7 of the New York State\n\nConstitution, members' rights in the Retirement System must be considered\ncontractual rights of employment which may not be diminished or impaired. Accordingly, the death benefit formulas could not have been restructured so as\nto not be age discriminatory by reducing the benefits payable on account of the\ndeaths of younger members, without violating the State Constitution. Rather, in\norder to comply with both OWBPA and the New York State Constitution, the death\nbenefit structure had to be revised in a manner which increased benefits\npayable on account of the deaths of older members (without decreasing amounts\npayable on account of younger members). There are two ways under which an employer may provide\nemployee disability and death benefit plans which comply with OWBPA. The first\nof the two -- the \"equal benefits\" approach is to provide benefits under which\nthe calculations and eligibility requirements do not contain age-based\ndistinctions. The second means of compliance is commonly referred to as the\n\"equal costs\" method, under which the costs of providing benefits to different\naged individuals are equal. To use the more common terminology, a benefit plan\nwith age-based distinctions may comply with OWBPA if the age-based distinctions\ncan be \"cost-justified.\"\nIn view of the State Constitution's mandate that the\n\nRetirement System bring its death and disability benefit structure in\ncompliance with OWBPA without reducing the benefits payable to or on account of\nthe death of younger members, it was less costly for the Retirement Systems to\nadopt and implement \"cost-justified\" death and disability retirement benefit\nstructures than it would have been to implement \"equal benefits\" structures. However, minimizing the cost of complying with OWBPA, while important, is not\nthe only reason that a cost-justified approach was utilized by the Retirement\n\nSystems. The Comptroller had a fiduciary obligation to accomplish compliance in\na manner which followed the existing state statutory benefit structure as\nclosely as possible. Accordingly, the fact that the existing provisions of the\nRSSL make aged-based distinctions in benefit calculations required adoption of\na \"cost-justified\" benefit structure. The Comptroller has directed the Retirement Systems to\ncommence paying disability and death benefits under calculation formulas that\nhave been restructured, pursuant to the recommendations in the Buck Report, to\ncomply with OWBPA in the manner that is both the least costly means of\ncompliance and which adheres most closely to the formulas provided in the\n\nRetirement and Social Security Law. The Retirement Systems have been paying all\nnew death and disability benefits under such OWBPA-complying formulas and are\napproaching completion of paying additional recalculated benefits to all death\nbenefit beneficiaries and disability pensioners who originally were paid\nnon-complying amounts since the October 1992 compliance date. This Part is promulgated for the purposes of publishing the\ndisability and death benefit formulas that have been restructured as required\nby OWBPA. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
