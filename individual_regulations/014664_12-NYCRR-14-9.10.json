  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.10 - Safety valve connections\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When two or more safety valves are used on a boiler, they may be mounted either\nseparately or as twin valves made by placing individual valves on Y bases, or\nduplex valves having two valves in the same body casing. Twin valves made by\nplacing individual valves on Y bases, or duplex valves having two valves in the\nsame body, shall be of approximately equal capacity. When not more than two\nvalves of different sizes are mounted singly, the relieving capacity of the\nsmaller valve shall be not less than 50 percent of that of the larger valve. When a boiler is fitted with two or more safety valves or safety relief valves\non one connection, this connection to the boiler shall have a cross sectional\narea not less than the combined areas of inlet connections of all the safety\nvalves with which it connects and shall also meet the requirements of section\n14-9.10\n(b) of\nthis Subpart. (b) The safety valve\nor safety relief valve or valves shall be connected to the boiler independent\nof any other steam connection, and attached as close as possible to the boiler\nor normal steam flow path, without any unnecessary intervening pipe or fitting. Such intervening pipe or fitting shall be not longer than the face-to-face\ndimension of the corresponding tee fitting of the same diameter and pressure\nunder the corresponding American National Standard. Every safety valve shall be\nconnected so as to stand in an upright position, with spindle vertical. On high\ntemperature water boilers of the watertube forced circulation type, the valve\nshall be located at the boiler outlet. Safety valves may be attached to drums\nor headers by welding provided the welding is done in accordance with Code\nrequirements. Safety valves may be attached to drums or headers provided the\nwelding is done in accordance with the requirements of this Part. (c) (1)\n\nThe\nopening or connection between the boiler and the safety valve shall have at\nleast the area of the valve inlet. No valve of any description shall be placed\nbetween the required safety valve or safety relief valve or valves and the\nboiler, nor on the discharge pipe between the safety valve or safety relief\nvalve and the atmosphere. When a discharge pipe is used, the cross-sectional\narea shall be not less than the full area of the valve outlet or of the total\nof the areas of the valve outlets discharging thereinto and shall be as short\nand straight as possible and so arranged as to avoid undue stresses on the\nvalve or valves. (2)\n\nAll safety\nvalve or safety relief valve discharges shall be so located or piped as to be\ncarried clear from running boards or platforms. Ample provision for gravity\ndrain shall be made in the discharge pipe at or near each safety valve, and\nwhere water of condensation may collect. Each valve shall have an open gravity\ndrain through the casing below the level of the valve seat. For iron and\nsteel-bodied valves exceeding 21/2inch size the drain hole shall be tapped not\nless than three-eighths inch pipe size. (3)\n\nDischarge piping from safety relief\nvalves on high temperature water boilers shall be provided with adequate\nprovisions for water drainage as well as the steam venting. The installation of\ncast iron bodied safety relief valves for high temperature water boilers is\nprohibited. (4)\n\nThe discharge of\nsafety valves or safety relief valves shall be located so as to prevent\nscalding. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
