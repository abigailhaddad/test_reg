  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.22 - Related organizations\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1430 ]\nA hospital itself may be\nsubsidiary to or under the control of a larger organization such as a\nuniversity, governmental entity or parent corporation. It is typical in such\nsituations for hospitals to receive services from these related organizations. Examples of services received are administration, purchasing, general\naccounting and menu planning. In addition, related organizations lease\nproperty, plant and equipment to hospitals as well as paying for various other\nitems such as insurance. The related organization then usually charges for the\nservice either directly or through a management fee. For uniform reporting\npurposes, the direct charges must be reported as purchased services in the\nappropriate functional cost centers as billed, and the management fee must be\nreported in the functional cost centers in amounts relative to the services\nreceived for which the fee is paid. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n442.22\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
