Tit. 16 § 603.3 - Metrics and performance thresholds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section sets forth the metrics and\nperformance thresholds that each service provider is expected to meet or exceed\nrelated to maintenance service, installations, network performance and answer\ntime. (b) (1)\n\nCustomer trouble report rate. This is composed of two metrics. The first metric is\ndefined as the number of initial customer trouble reports per hundred access\nlines per month and has a performance threshold of 5.5 or less for each central\noffice. The second metric is applicable to service providers with 7 or more\ncentral offices, and is defined as the percentage of a service provider's total\ncentral office entities that perform at or below 3.3, and has a performance\nthreshold of at least 85 percent. (2)\n\nReports included in the customer trouble\nreport rate are limited to troubles associated with the regulated components of\nresidential, business, Centrex and pay telephone service of the service\nprovider's customers, and also includes all regulated features associated with\nthese services except voice mailboxes. (3)\n\nCustomer trouble reports received as a\nresult of any network failure are included in the report rate. (4)\n\nSeparate trouble reports should be\nrecorded and included in the customer trouble report rate for multiple-line\ncustomers, for each access line identified by the customer. (c) (1)\n\nPercent out-of-service over 24 hours. This metric is defined as the monthly percentage of customer trouble reports\nclassified as out-of-service which are not cleared within 24 hours. The\nperformance threshold for each maintenance administrative entity is 20 percent\nor less. (2)\n\nOnly trouble reports\nincluded in the customer trouble report rate shall be used to determine the\npercent out-of-service over 24 hours. (d) (1)\n\nPercent service affecting over 48 hours. This metric is defined as the monthly\npercentage of customer trouble reports classified as service affecting which\nare not cleared within 48 hours. The performance threshold for each maintenance\nadministrative entity is 20.0 percent or less. (2)\n\nOnly trouble reports included in the\ncustomer trouble report rate shall be used to determine the percent service\naffecting over 48 hours. (e) Percent initial basic local\nexchange service line installations completed within five days. This metric is defined as the monthly percentage of initial\nbasic local exchange service line installations completed within five working\ndays (following the day the order is received) and has a performance threshold\nof 80.0 percent or greater for each installation administrative entity.

(f) (1)\n\nPercent installation commitments missed. This metric is defined as the\npercentage of installation commitments missed per month and has a performance\nthreshold of 10.0 percent or less for each installation administrative\nentity. (2)\nA missed installation\ncommitment occurs when initial basic local exchange service is not provided to\nthe consumer's interface on or before the end of the day of the appointment\ninterval with the customer except when due to consumer fault or other condition\nas defined in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nFor purposes of this section, the terms\nconsumer fault\nand\nother\nare defined to\ninclude the following: (i) Consumer fault\noccurs when during the appointment interval, the consumer is not ready, there\nis not access to or there exists unsafe conditions at the consumer's premises, or on or before the commitment date the consumer requests a later\ndate. (ii)\n\nOther circumstances such\nas set forth in section\n603.1\n(c) of this\n\nPart or the need to reassign a significant portion of the service provider's\ninstallation work force in order to re- establish service to existing customers\nwho lost service as a result of circumstances set forth in section\n603.1\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (g) Percent final trunk group blockages. This metric is defined as the monthly percentage of blocked\ncalls on any local, toll and local operator final trunk groups and has a\nperformance threshold of 3.0 percent or less for each final trunk group. (h) (1)\n\nBusiness office answer time. This metric\nis defined as the monthly percentage of consumer calls of the business office\nanswered within 30 seconds. The performance threshold for each administrative\nentity is 80.0 percent or greater. (2)\n\nCalls answered, 15 percent of calls\nabandoned, and 10 percent of calls blocked or routed to an intercept message\nare to be included when determining the total number of calls to be\nanswered. (i) (1)\n\nRepair office answer time. This metric is\ndefined as the monthly percentage of consumer calls for repair office service\nanswered within 30 seconds. The performance threshold for each administrative\nentity is 80.0 percent or greater. (2)\n\nCalls answered, 15 percent of calls\nabandoned, and 10 percent of calls blocked or routed to an intercept message\nare to be included when determining the total number of calls to be\nanswered.

(1)\n\nThis metric is defined as the monthly\npercentage of calls for operator assistance service answered within 10 seconds. The performance threshold for each administrative entity is 90.0 percent or\ngreater. (2)\n\nThis metric is defined\nas the monthly average speed of answer of calls for operator assistance.
