Tit. 14 § 527.10 - Visiting at facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Subject to\nthe provisions of section\n527.12\nof this Part, residents of\nfacilities operated or licensed by the Office of Mental Health have a right to\nreceive visitors at reasonable times, to have privacy when visited, to\nauthorize those family members and other adults who will be given priority to\nvisit, and to communicate freely with persons within or outside the\nfacility. (b) Visiting rights at\nfacilities. (1)\n\nRecognizing that, in general, having visitors and visiting outside of the facility is part of the recovery\nprocess which maintains ties with family and the rest of the community, all\nfacilities shall establish visiting hours and policies which are designed to\nfacilitate the exercise of the right to receive visitors. Such policies: (i) must not be unduly onerous to\nresidents; (ii)\nmust be as flexible\nas administratively feasible; (iii)\nshall not require prior notification or request by either the resident or the\nvisitor, except when such visits would interfere with the regularly scheduled\ntherapeutic activities in which patients are engaged, or as provided in section\n527.12\nof this Part; (iv)\nshould, in order to preserve the\ntherapeutic environment of the facility, be tailored in a manner that\nfacilitates visiting while avoiding interference with the regularly scheduled\nactivities in which residents are engaged, such as school attendance, program\nparticipation, and mealtime, by ensuring that in individual cases where an\naccommodation can be made without compromising the clinical care of the\nresident or other residents, facilities shall make reasonable efforts to do\nso; (v) shall require the\nestablishment of regular visiting hours during every day and every evening of\nthe week, provided, however, that facilities operated by the office shall\nestablish regular visiting hours based on the facility's security needs and the\nneeds of the specific population served (i.e., adults, children, or persons\nresiding in forensic or secure treatment facilities), their families, and the\ncommunity, as well as all other requirements of this subdivision; and\n(vi)\nwith respect to facilities which serve\nminors 18 years of age or under, may require prior authorization of visitors by\nthe person or entity with legal authority to consent to treatment for such\nminor, if in the best clinical interests of the resident. (2)\n\nEach facility shall establish a space\nwhere visitors may meet with residents in comfortable surroundings with a\nreasonable degree of privacy. Visitors should be encouraged to visit in the\nliving, dining, and recreational areas with patients, as well as to visit\noutside the facility with the resident. (3)\n\nIn exceptional instances, it may be\nnecessary to restrict a resident's visiting right. Such restriction can only be\nimposed in accordance with section\n527.12\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y.
