  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 37.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Chapter 413 of\nthe Laws of 1991 added a new section 54.90 to the Local Finance Law. This\nstatute authorizes counties, cities, towns and villages (hereinafter\n\"municipalities\") to issue, until June 30, 1994, bonds or notes that bear\nvariable rates of interest in accordance with the requirements of that section. Among other things, section 54.90 requires, in certain instances, that the\nissuer enter into one or more letter of credit or liquidity facility\nagreements. It also permits the issuer to enter into an agreement for the\nremarketing or repurchasing of its bonds or notes. Section\n54.90\nof\nthe Local Finance Law also permits the issuer of variable rate obligations, subject to rules promulgated by the State Comptroller, to: (1)\narrange for the underwriting of such\nobligations at private sale through a negotiated agreement with the\ncompensation for such underwriting to be provided either by the payment of a\nnegotiated fee to the underwriter or by the sale of such obligations to the\nunderwriter at a discount; or\n(2)\narrange for the private sale of such obligations through negotiated agreement\nwith the compensation for such sale to be provided by negotiated fee. (b) Chapter 413 also amended\nparagraph e of section\n57.00\nof\nthe Local Finance Law to provide that, for the three-year period commencing\n\nJuly 1, 1991, a municipality, school district or district corporation may sell\nits bonds at public sale at a price of less than the par value of the issue of\nbonds provided that: (1)\nsuch bonds are sold\nat a price not less than seventy-five percentum of such par value less the cost\nof issuance of such issue of bonds; and\n(2)\nthat the average life of the issue of\nsuch bonds shall not be greater as a result of such sale at a discount than it\nwould be if the issue were sold at its par value in an amount equal to the\namount actually received by the municipality, school district or district\ncorporation. (c) Chapter\n413 also added a new paragraph f to section 57.00. This new paragraph provides\nthat, to facilitate the marketing of any bonds issued pursuant to paragraph e\nof section 57.00, the municipality, school district or district corporation\nmay, subject to rules promulgated by the State Comptroller: (1)\narrange for the underwriting of such\nbonds at private sale through a negotiated agreement with the compensation for\nsuch underwriting to be provided either by the payment of a negotiated fee to\nthe underwriter or by the sale of bonds to the underwriter at a discount; or\n(2)\narrange for the private sale\nof such bonds through negotiated agreement with the compensation for such sale\nto be provided by negotiated fee. (d) Section\n57.10\nof\nthe Local Finance Law, also enacted by Chapter 413 of the Laws of 1991, requires the State Comptroller to promulgate rules governing the negotiated\nsale of bonds or notes authorized by sections 54.90 and 57.00 and provides that\nno municipality, school district or district corporation shall sell bonds or\nnotes on a negotiated basis without prior approval of the State Comptroller\nexcept as provided in such rules. These rules are expressly required to set\nforth the circumstances under which the State Comptroller's prior approval will\nnot be required. (e) The State\n\nComptroller believes that competitive sale of municipal bonds and notes in a\nstable market with a normal yield curve generally produces the lowest interest\ncost to issuers and provides an equal opportunity for potential purchasers to\nobtain an award of obligations. For these reasons, the State Comptroller has\nconsistently favored the competitive sale of obligations unless an issuer would\nhave difficulty utilizing competitive sale because of one or more of the\nfollowing factors: (1)\nunstable or volatile\nmarket conditions; (2)\nconditions\nof fiscal stress or negative credit factors being experienced by the\nissuer; (3)\nthe large dollar amount\nof the proposed issue; or\n(4)\nthe\ncomplexity of the proposed issue. (f) The complexity of variable rate debt\ntransactions may warrant the use of negotiated sales. The State Comptroller\nbelieves that the authorization and issuance of all debt obligations is, in the\nfirst instance, the responsibility of the municipal issuer and its local\nofficials. Therefore, these regulations permit a municipality to make its own\ndetermination whether to sell variable rate obligations at negotiated sale. To\nhelp ensure that the negotiated sale of variable rate debt is in the best\ninterests of the issuer and that the procurement of the professional services\nnecessary to conduct the sale is accomplished in an open and competitive\nmanner, any municipality choosing to sell its variable rate obligations at\nnegotiated sale shall be required to comply with, and make the determinations\nrequired by, the policies and procedures contained in section\n37.5\nof this Part. (g) The State Comptroller does not believe\nthat there is anything inherent in the sale of bonds at a discount that\nrequires the use of negotiated sales. As noted, however, the State Comptroller\ndoes recognize that unstable or volatile market conditions, conditions of\nfiscal stress or negative credit factors being experienced by an issuer, the\nlarge dollar amount of the proposed issue, or the complexity of an issue may\nrender the sale of bonds at competitive sale impractical or impossible. Therefore, if a municipality, school district or district corporation believes\nthat one or more of these factors will make it difficult to sell a proposed\nissue at competitive public sale, it may seek approval of the State Comptroller\nto sell such bonds on a negotiated basis pursuant to sections\n57.00\n(f) and\n57.10\nof\nthe Local Finance Law. Where such a negotiated sale of bonds has been approved\nby the State Comptroller, the municipality, school district or district\ncorporation shall be required to sell those bonds in accordance with the\npolicies and procedures contained in section\n37.5\nof this Part.
