Tit. 14 § 578.8 - Computation of rate of payment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The rate of\npayment shall consist of an operating cost per diem and a capital cost per\ndiem, computed from allowable costs and subject to cost category standards. The\nrate year shall be the 12-month period from July 1st through June 30th. The\nrate of payment effective July 1, 1995 through June 30, 1996 shall be a\ncontinuance of the rate of payment effective July 1, 1994 through June 30, 1995. The rate of payment effective July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012, and\n\nJuly 1, 2012 through June 30, 2013, shall be a continuance of the rate of\npayment in effect on June 30, 2011, except to the extent necessary to adjust\nsuch payments pursuant to the provisions of section\n578.14\n(o) of this\n\nPart. (1)\n\nAllowable costs shall be determined\nfrom the cost report as submitted pursuant to section\n578.5\nof this Part for the base\nyear which is the fiscal year two years prior to the rate year, and are subject\nto principles of reimbursement pursuant to section\n578.14\nof this Part. The\ncommissioner may determine that a provider has inadequate cost experience for\nthe base year and may select an alternate cost report period, in which case the\ncosts will be adjusted to reflect the costs in the base year. (2)\n\nCost category standards (i.e., screens or\nthe maximum amount that will be reimbursed for a specific expense or group of\nexpenses) shall be considered when calculating the total reimbursable costs to\nbe included in the operating component for reimbursable services for\nresidential treatment facilities. (i) A cost\ncategory standard shall be determined for combined administration, support and\nmaintenance services. Reimbursable cost per diem shall be the lesser of the\nstandard or the allowable administrative, support and maintenance cost per\ndiem. The administration, support and maintenance services standard is computed\nseparately for upstate and downstate facilities. The standard is computed from\nthe base year using a combination of 50 percent of the average allowed per diem\ncost for the applicable region and 50 percent of the statewide average per diem\ncost, plus seven and one-half percent. (ii)\n\nThe reimbursable costs for the\nmedical/clinical services including nursing, shall be the lesser of the\nallowable costs reported on the base year cost report or the medical/clinical\nscreen multiplied by the FTE standard, as determined by the commissioner. The\nmedical/clinical screen is computed separately for upstate and downstate\nfacilities. The screen is computed from the base year using a combination of 50\npercent of the average allowed per diem cost for the applicable region and 50\npercent of the statewide average per diem cost, plus seven and one-half\npercent. (iii)\n\nDownstate facilities\nare defined as those facilities in the following counties: Bronx, Kings, New\n\nYork, Putnam, Queens, Richmond, Rockland, Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk. Upstate facilities are all those facilities located in the remaining counties\nof New York State. (3)\n\nThe purchase of health services category shall include all allowable costs\npursuant to section\n578.14\nof this Part as defined\npursuant to section\n584.11\n(d) of this\n\nTitle. The services allowable in the purchase of health services category shall\nbe approved by the commissioner. (4)\n\nThe allowable costs, as set forth in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, that meet the requirements stated in\nparagraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, shall be trended by the applicable\n\nMedicare inflation factor for hospitals and units excluded from the prospective\npayment system except for the rate periods effective July 1, 1996 through June\n30, 1997, and July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010, where the inflation factor\nused to trend costs will be limited to the inflation factor for the first year\nof the two-year period. No trend shall be applied to allowable costs for the\nrate period effective July 1, 2013 through June 30, 2014, and July 1, 2014\nthrough December 31, 2014. (5)\n\nThe\ncapital cost per diem shall be determined from the base year cost report as\nsubmitted pursuant to section\n578.5\nof this Part, and subject to\nthe principles of reimbursement pursuant to section\n578.14\nof this Part.
