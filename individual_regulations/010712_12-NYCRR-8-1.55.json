  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 8-1.55 - Interlock\n\nState Regulations\n(See definition §\n8-1.1.)\n(a) The functioning of an interlock to\nprevent the movement of the car shall not be dependent upon the closing of an\nelectric circuit. (b) Any force or\nforces used to perform any interlocking function shall be so arranged that\ntheir failure to cause the interlocking action will prevent the movement of the\ncar. Interlocks employing springs, gravity or a combination of the two forces, may be used when approved by the Industrial Commissioner if the device is found\nto be safe, practical and reliable. These forces, however, are not considered\ndesirable if they are arranged so that their failure would create an unsafe\ncondition. Note: Helical tension springs are considered\nparticularly undesirable. (c) The force or forces used to perform any\ninterlocking function to prevent the movement of the car shall be such that\neven without lubrication the intended functioning of the interlock shall be\ncompletely performed. (d) Interlocks shall be so designed and installed as to prevent, as far as\npossible, being tampered with or intentionally rendered inoperative (except as\nnoted in §\n8-1.57\ncovering emergency\nrelease). (See also §§\n8-1.6, 8-1.58, 8- 1.59.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n8-1.55\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
