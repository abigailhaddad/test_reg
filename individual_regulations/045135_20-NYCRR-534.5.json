  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 534.5 - Refund or credit based on the use of tangible personal property in certain services or based on a retail sale by a contractor\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1119(c)\n(a) Used in certain services. (1)\n\nAuthorization. A refund or credit is allowable to the purchaser of\ntangible personal property for any New York State or local sales or\ncompensating use tax paid thereon where such tangible personal property is\nlater used by such purchaser in the rendering of a service subject to sales tax\nunder paragraph (1), (2), (3) or (5) of subdivision (c) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law, or the compensating\nuse tax under section\n1110\nof the Tax Law which is limited\nto: (i) furnishing information services\n(Tax Law, § 1105[c][1]), see section\n527.3\nof this Title; (ii)\nthe services of\nproducing, fabricating, processing, printing, or imprinting tangible personal\nproperty (Tax Law, § 1105[c][2]), see section\n527.4\nof this Title; (iii)\ninstalling, maintaining, servicing, or repairing tangible personal property (Tax Law, §\n1105[c][3]), see section\n527.5\nof this Title; (iv)\nmaintaining, servicing, or repairing real property or land (Tax Law, § 1105[c][5]), see\nsection\n527.7\nof this Title. (2)\n\nLimitations. However, a refund or credit of tax paid on tangible\npersonal property by the purchaser rendering the services outlined in\nsubparagraphs (i) through (iv) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision is only\nallowable where: (i) the tangible\npersonal property has become a physical component part of the property being\nserviced; or\n(ii)\nthe tangible\npersonal property has been transferred to the purchaser of the service in\nconjunction with the rendering of the service subject to tax. Example 1: A retail merchant pays sales tax on its purchases of\nstationery for its own use. Part of the stationery is used to transmit credit\ninformation reports about customers to anyone desiring such information. The\nsale of the credit information reports is a taxable information service under\nsection\n1105 (c)(1)\nof the Tax Law, and the retail merchant is entitled to a refund or credit for any tax paid on\nthe stationery transferred to the purchaser of the reports. Example 2: Company A maintains a repair shop to service its own\nvehicles and pays sales tax on all repair parts purchased. Company A, as a\nconvenience, agrees to repair a disabled vehicle of Company B for a charge. The\nrepair of Company B's vehicle is a taxable service, under section\n1105 (c)(3)\nof the Tax Law, and Company A is entitled to a refund or credit for the tax it paid on repair\nparts which become a part of Company B's vehicle. Example 3: Corporation A maintains a large in-house printing unit. It\nagrees to do some printing, which is taxable under section\n1105 (c)(2)\nof the Tax Law, for firm B which will furnish the paper. In providing the printing service, Corporation A uses ink on which it paid tax. Corporation A may claim a refund\nor credit for the tax paid on the ink used in the taxable printing\nservice. Example 4: A heating repairman paid tax on his purchase of parts to be\nused in servicing his customer's heating equipment. When he performs repair\nwork subject to tax using such parts, he is entitled to a refund or credit of\nthe tax he paid. (b) Contractor retail sales. A contractor, subcontractor or repairman who makes a retail\nsale of tangible personal property upon which tax was required to be paid when\npurchased by the contractor, subcontractor or repairman pursuant to the\nprovisions of section\n1101 (b)(4)\nof the Tax Law\nmay apply for a credit or refund of such tax. Example 5: Construction contractor A has surplus roofing shingles on\nwhich tax has been paid. Contractor B purchases the surplus shingles at retail\nfrom contractor A and pays sales tax. Contractor A is entitled to a refund or\ncredit for the tax paid by him on the shingles sold to B. (c) No refund or credit is allowable for tax\npaid on tangible personal property purchased by a person performing a\nnontaxable service. Example 6: A contractor enters into an agreement for interior floor\ncleaning and maintenance service for a period in excess of 30 days. Under\nsection\n1105 (c)(5)\nof the Tax Law, there is no sales tax on interior cleaning and maintenance service performed on\na regular contractual basis for a term of 30 days or more except window\ncleaning, rodent and pest control and trash removal services. Tangible personal\nproperty purchased, such as floor cleanser and polish, even though transferred\nin conjunction with the service, is taxable to the contractor, and no refund is\nallowable to him on such purchases. (d) No refund or credit is allowable for tax\npaid on tangible personal property purchased by a person performing a taxable\nservice where such person is the user of the property and such property is not\ntransferred to the purchaser of the service in conjunction with the performance\nof the service subject to tax. For example, the transfer of such property\nthrough abandonment by the user at the site where the service was performed, or\nthe transfer of such property to the purchaser of the service, as a means of\ndisposition of such used property, is not deemed to be a transfer in\nconjunction with the rendering of a taxable service. Example 7: A house painter abandons his drop cloths on the job site. The drop cloths are not considered to be transferred in conjunction with the\ntaxable service of painting the house even though the painter may separately\nbill the customer for supplies used in the performance of his contractual\nagreement. Consequently, a refund or credit for tax paid on the drop cloths is\nnot allowable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
