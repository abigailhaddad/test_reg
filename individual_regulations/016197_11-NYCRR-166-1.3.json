  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 166-1.3 - Profitability data averaged\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Profitability data shall be averaged over a six-year period. (b) In measuring profitability from all sources of income, including capital gains, investment income and underwriting income, it is desirable to use a base of several years in order to minimize volatility in the results. The business cycle in insurance is believed to be approximately six years in length. While little can be deduced from the volatile results of a single year, an excess profit over a six-year period would be good evidence that the forces of competition have been insufficient to exercise a natural control over the prices and profits of insurers. (c) See section\n166-2.3\nof this Part for discussion of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n166-1.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
