A contractor may purchase the service of trash or\ndebris removal without payment of tax as a purchase for resale provided that: (1)\nthe contractor generated the trash or\ndebris being removed from real property, property or land as a result of the\ncontractor's performance of the service of maintaining, servicing or repairing\nsuch real property, property or land; (2)\nthe contractor's agreement with the owner\nor authorized occupant of such real property, property or land for whom the\ncontractor performed such service provides that the contractor is responsible\nto have such trash or debris removed; and\n(3)\nthe contractor furnishes to the person\nperforming such trash or debris removal service a properly completed\ncontractor's exempt purchase certificate. In such circumstances, the contractor's total charges to\nsuch owner or authorized occupant for such service of maintaining, servicing or\nrepairing such property and for such trash or debris removal service are\nsubject to tax. However, if the purchaser is an exempt organization described\nin section\n1116 (a)\nof the Tax Law and\ngives the contractor a properly completed exempt organization certification, then such service would be exempt. (b) Capital improvements. A contractor may\npurchase the service of trash or debris removal without payment of tax where: (1)\nthe contractor performs work which\nconstitutes a capital improvement, to real property, property or\nland; (2)\nthe contractor generated\nthe trash or debris to be removed from such real property, property or land as\na result of such work; (3)\nthe\ncontractor obtains a properly completed certificate of capital improvement from\nthe contractor's customer; and\n(4)\nthe contractor or such customer furnishes a copy of such certificate to the\nperson performing such trash or debris removal service. Since the contractor's purchase of the trash or debris\nremoval service is in conjunction with the performance of a capital\nimprovement, the contractor's total charge to its customer for the capital\nimprovement is not subject to tax.
