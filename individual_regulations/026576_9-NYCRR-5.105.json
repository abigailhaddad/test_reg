Tit. 9 § 5.105 - Executive order no. 105: establishing a task force for the creation of an institute for river and estuary research and education in the hudson river valley\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, Americans have been learning from the majestic\n\nHudson River since before they had a nation to call their own. No other river\nis more deeply connected to our country's heritage. It has played critical\nroles in the exploration, settlement, freedom and prosperity of this state and\nnation. Today, the Hudson River continues to be an important commercial and\nrecreational waterway, and one of the jewels of New York State; WHEREAS, among many things, the Hudson River inspired an\nimportant American art movement, which took its name from the river. Efforts to\nprotect the Hudson were central to the development of the modern American\nenvironmental movement, leading to landmark legislation such as the National\n\nEnvironmental Policy Act. In recognition of its importance to our state and\nnation, the federal government designated the Hudson River as one of the first\n\nAmerican Heritage Rivers on July 30,1998; WHEREAS, New Yorkers have made a substantial financial\ncommitment to understand, restore and protect the Hudson River and its estuary\nthrough many public programs, including the Hudson River Estuary Management\n\nProgram, the Environmental Protection Fund and the Clean Water/Clean Air Bond\n\nAct of 1996. This commitment, along with the work of many institutions and\norganizations, has produced a tremendous improvement in water quality and has\ncontributed new knowledge to the practice of environmental management to\nrestore ecosystems and provide for their public use, understanding and\nenjoyment; WHEREAS, the Hudson River, like other American Heritage\n\nRivers, continues to inspire us and to warrant our unwavering commitment to\nunderstand, restore and protect it. Just as it has taught and inspired us, it\nhas the capacity to teach and inspire others around the world, so that they\nwill also share in an understanding of ecosystem processes of rivers and their\nestuaries, and help us develop basic and applied science and technology tools\nfor river and estuary protection and restoration; and\nWHEREAS, the time has come for New York State and the many\nprivate and public organizations and institutions that work to better\nunderstand, protect and restore rivers and estuaries to join forces in the\ncreation of a new institute for river and estuary research and education, to be\nlocated in the Hudson River Valley, which will expand and export our efforts\nfor the benefit of the people of New York and the world.
