  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4410.3 - Off-track pick four pool conducted solely off-track\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When approved by the commission after\nfiling of the required written consent of the track affected, an off-track\nbetting pool designated a pick four pool may be conducted by one or a\ncombination of off-track betting corporations in a single off-track pool, which\npool is not combined with any pool at a track. (b) The pick four (or other approved name) is\na form of pari-mutuel wagering conducted by an off-track betting corporation on\nfour races run at any track specifically designated as the pick four races by\nthe commission. Each bettor selects, in order, the first placed horse in each\nof the four races designated and advertised by the corporation as the pick four\nraces, in the race order so designated by the commission. (c) The pick four is not a parlay and has no\nconnection with nor relation to the other betting pools for the respective\nraces. The pick four pool shall be held entirely separate from all other pools\nand is no part of a daily double, exacta, triple or other wagering\npool. (d) Resale of pick four\ntickets from one individual to another is prohibited, shall be grounds for\nejection, and may be deemed illegal gambling. (e) Races in which pick four pools shall be\nconducted shall be approved by the commission and shall be clearly designated\nin the program and racing cards issued by the corporation. (f) The design of the pick four tickets shall\nbe clearly and immediately distinguishable from other pari-mutuel\ntickets. (g) Scratched horses and\nnonstarters. At any time after wagering begins on the pick four pool, should an\nentire betting entry or field be scratched or declared a nonstarter in any pick\nfour race, no further tickets selecting such betting entry or field shall be\nissued, and wagers upon such betting entry or field, for purposes of the pick\nfour pool, shall be deemed wagers upon the betting entry or field (designated\nhorse) upon which the most wagering money has been registered at the site of\nthe statewide interface in the win pool at the close of win pool betting for\nsuch race. (In the event of a money tie, the tied betting entry or field with\nthe lowest program number shall be designated.) Wagers in the pick four pool\nupon an entry or field of horses from which a starter or starters may have been\nscratched will, in the case of such entry or field, be deemed wagers upon the\nhorse or horses remaining in such entry or field; except that if totalisator\ncapability to record wagers selecting a coupled entry (or field) and wagers\nselecting any individual constituent horses therein (merging such wagers for\nodds display and payoff purposes), is employed, then the wagers upon scratched\nconstituent horses will be deemed wagers upon the \"designated horse\" in such\nrace. In case no starter remains representing any betting entry or field, wagers upon such entry or field, shall be deemed wagers upon the \"designated\nhorse\" in the race affected by the scratch. Should the balance of a betting\nentry or field race as a nonbetting starter for purposes of other pari-mutuel\npools at the site of the statewide interface, wagers upon such entry or field\nshall be deemed wagers upon the \"designated horse\" for such race. Should a\nprogrammed starter be scratched or declared a nonstarter in any pick-four race\nprior to the start of the first leg, the betting operator shall be authorized\nto refund any tickets designating betting entries affected thereby prior to\nsuch first leg. (h) Failure to\nselect a winning combination. (1)\n\nIf no pick\nfour ticket is sold combining the winners of the four pick four races, all pick\nfour tickets designating three winners shall be considered winning tickets and\nthe net pool distributed equally to holders of said tickets. (2)\n\nIf no pick four ticket is sold combining\nthe winners of either four or three races of the four pick four races, all pick\nfour tickets designating two winners shall be considered winning tickets and\nthe net pool distributed equally to holders of said tickets. (3)\n\nIf no pick four ticket is sold combining\nthe winners of either four, three or two races of the four pick four races, all\npick four tickets designating one winner shall be considered winning tickets\nand the net pool distributed equally to holders of said tickets. (4)\n\nIf no pick four ticket is sold\ndesignating any winner to win in the designated pick four races, the pick four\nshall be declared off and the gross pool refunded. (5)\n\nIf any of the designated races are\ncancelled or declared \"no race,\" the pick four will be determined by the\nwinners of the remaining race or races. (i) Dead heats. In the event of a dead heat\nfor win in any or all pick four races, all pick four tickets designating either\nhorse to win in said race or races shall be eligible for participation in the\nremaining pick four races, and the net pool shall be equally distributed to the\nwinners, that is, the net pool will be divided by the total amount represented\nby all winning tickets and the resulting price, per dollar, and after breakage, shall be the payoff price, which shall be uniform for any winning\ncombination. (j) In the event of\noccurrences not encompassed with the explicit provisions of this section, distribution shall be formulated on the basis of established pari-mutuel\npractice and in accordance with the distribution philosophy set forth in this\nsection; provided, nevertheless, that if full distribution of the pool is made\non the basis of outstanding tickets, the method of formulation announced by the\ncorporation, and upon which basis payments have been made, shall be deemed\nconclusively correct and not subject to review. (k) Copies of this section shall be made\navailable free of charge to the public in each betting facility of the\ncorporation. (l) Placing of horses\nshall follow the official placing for betting purposes at the track, and such\nplacing shall be conclusive for distribution purposes herein. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
