The principal function of the hearing is\nto resolve disputed issues of fact. It is the policy of the department to\nensure that the public hearings it conducts provide a fair and efficient\nmechanism for the development of a factual record for the decision on a permit\nand, to that end, that all statements and testimony be relevant and directed\ntoward achieving that goal. The process described in the following text may\ninvolve a legislative hearing session on a draft environmental impact\nstatement, an adjudicatory hearing session with sworn testimony and\ncross-examination, formal filing of documents, and expenses to the applicant\nfor a hearing room, stenographic services and public notice. This Part also\ncontains provisions for subpoenas, stipulations, conferences, standards and\nevidence, and exchange of information by\nparties. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
