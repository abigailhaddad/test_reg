Tit. 9 § 5319.13 - Program storage device requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe term program storage device means the media or an\nelectronic device that contains the critical control program components. Device\ntypes include, without limitation, EPROMs, compact flash cards, optical disks, hard drives, solid state drives, USB drives or other storage technology that\nmay evolve. Each program storage device shall: (a) be housed within a fully enclosed and\nlocked logic compartment; (b) be\nclearly marked with sufficient information to identify the software and\nrevision level of the information stored in the device. In the case of media\ntypes on which multiple programs may reside, it is acceptable to display this\ninformation via the attendant menu; (c) validate itself during each processor\nreset; and\n(d) validate itself the\nfirst time such storage device is used. In addition, CD-ROM, DVD and other optical-disk-based\nprogram storage shall not be a re-writeable disk and the \"session\" shall be\nclosed to prevent any further writing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
