  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 166-1.2 - Aggregate industry data used\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Aggregate industry data shall be used in testing profitability, rather than individual- insurer results. (b) The aggregate industry data approach has been adopted to minimize random fluctuations, to avoid unfair treatment of insurers with differing financial makeup, and to permit the selection of one relatively low and logically defensible excess profit point. (c) See section\n166-2.2\nof this Part for discussion of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n166-1.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
