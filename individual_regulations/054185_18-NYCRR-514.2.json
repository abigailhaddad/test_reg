Tit. 18 § 514.2 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The department\nhas established an electronic eligibility verification system whereby a\nprovider may determine the eligibility status of any person seeking care, services or supplies under the MA program before furnishing care, services or\nsupplies to such person. (b) The\nsystem was designed to assure that a provider can verify the current MA\neligibility of persons seeking medical or dental care, services or supplies\nand, thus, be assured that legitimate claims submitted to the department for\nservices rendered to eligible recipients will be paid. (c) If, on the date of service, the provider\nverifies eligibility in accordance with the verification procedures of this\n\nPart, payment will not be denied because the recipient was not MA eligible on\nthe date that the care, services or supplies were furnished. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n514.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
