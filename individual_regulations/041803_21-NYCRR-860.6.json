  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 860.6 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Biochemical\noxygen demand. Biochemical oxygen demand as determined under standard\nlaboratory procedures for 5 days at 20° C. (b) Carbonaceous oxygen demand. That part of\nthe ultimate oxygen demand associated with biochemical oxidation of\ncarbonaceous, as distinct from nitrogenous material. (c) Effective disinfection. The destruction\nof pathogenic organisms in such manner and under such controls as shall be\nprescribed by commission regulations. (d) Secondary treatment. (1)\n\nThe removal of practically all suspended\nsolids at all times. (2)\n\nThe\nreduction of the biochemical oxygen demand by at least 85 percent; the 85\npercent reduction may be modified, upon application for dilute industrial\nprocess wastewater. (3)\n\nMay include\nthe in-plant control of industrial wastes as prescribed by the\ncommission. (e) River\nmile. The distance, in statute miles, of a location or item measured from \"mile\nzero.\"\n(1)\n\nDelaware Bay and River. (i) Mile zero is located at the intersection\nof the centerline of the navigation channel and a line between the Cape May\n\nLight and the tip of Cape Henlopen. (ii)\n\nDistances from mile zero are measured\nessentially along the centerline of the navigation channel up to the\n\nTrenton-Morrisville Toll Bridge (RM 133.4) and above that point along the State\nboundary line as shown on published quadrangle maps of the United States\n\nGeological Survey. (2)\n\nTributaries. (i) Mile zero is located at the\nintersection of the centerline of the tributary and a line joining the opposite\nbanks at its mouth. (ii)\n\nDistances\nfrom mile zero are measured along the centerline of the tributary. (f) Intermittent\nstreams. A stream is intermittent when it meets either of the following\nconditions: (1)\na stream with less than a 0.1\ncfs minimum consecutive 7-day natural flow with a 10-year recurrence interval; or\n(2)\na ditch, canal or natural\nwatercourse which serves only to convey runoff during and after a\nstorm. (g) Background, total dissolved solids. The observed concentration of total dissolved solids\nduring low flow conditions or, in the absence thereof, an estimate acceptable\nto the commission. (h) IRIS The\n\nIntegrated Risk Information System established and maintained by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. An electronic data base containing information\non the toxicity and carcinogenicity of individual substances which can be\naccessed by regulatory agencies and the public. (i) Carcinogen. A substance for which there\nis no level of exposure that does not pose a small, finite probability of\ninducing benign or malignant tumors. (j) Systemic toxicant. A substance having a\nthreshold exposure which must be exceeded before deleterious effects (other\nthan cancer) are observed in organ systems. (k) Acute effects. Effects (including but not\nlimited to lethality) due to exposure to a toxicant over a short time\nperiod. (l) Chronic effects. Effects\n(including but not limited to reduced reproduction, reduced growth and\nlethality) due to exposure to a toxicant over a relatively long period of time\nrelative to the life span of the exposed organism. (m) Cancer potency factor (CPF). The slope of\nthe dose response curve in the low dose region expressed as the risk per\nmilligram of a toxic substance per kilogram of body weight per day\n(mg/KG/day)-1. (n) Reference dose\n(RfD). The daily exposure to a substance that is likely to be without an\nappreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime expressed as\nmilligram of the substance per kilogram of body weight per day\n(mg/KG/day). (o) Maximum contaminant\nlevel (MCL). The maximum permissible level of a contaminant in water which is\ndelivered to any user of a public water system. (p) Stream quality objectives. Numeric values\nfor specific pollutants and narrative descriptions of the quality of a\nwaterbody that will assure that the designated uses of the waterbody, including\nthe protection of aquatic life and human health, are\nachieved. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n860.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
