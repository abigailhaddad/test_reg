  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 648.3 - Payment of tax after mortgage for an indefinite amount is recorded\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 256\n(a) If for any reason the payment of the taxes described in Part 642 of this Title\nis first tendered after such a mortgage has been recorded, the amount of taxes\ndue must be computed based upon the higher of: (1)\nthe fair market value of the mortgaged\nproperty on the date that the mortgage was executed; or\n(2)\nthe portion of the amount secured by the\nmortgage on the date that the mortgage was executed which is determinable by\nthe terms of the mortgage; unless the commissioner grants an order authorizing the use\nof a sworn statement of maximum amount, as described in subdivision (b) of this\nsection. Provided, however, in no event shall such maximum amount set forth in\nsuch statement be less than the amount described in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (b) Where the commissioner finds that the failure to pay such taxes was due to an\nhonest misconception on the part of the recording officer or the mortgagor or\nmortgagee as to the nature of such instrument and its taxability, such as\nwhereby the instrument was not recognized as a mortgage at the time it was\nrecorded or was recognized as a mortgage but not a mortgage for an indefinite\namount, the commissioner may grant an order expressly authorizing use of a\nsworn statement of maximum amount for the purpose of computing the taxes due. The maximum amount set forth in such sworn statement must be such amount\nsecured or which under any contingency may be secured by the mortgage as of the\ndate the mortgage was executed. Provided, however, such amount cannot be less\nthan that portion of the amount secured on the date the mortgage was executed\nwhich is determinable by the terms of the mortgage. The amount due must include\nthe applicable interest and penalties as provided in Part 653 of this\n\nTitle. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
