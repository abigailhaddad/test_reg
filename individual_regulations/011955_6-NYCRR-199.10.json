This memorandum shall become part of the\napproved management plan. (b) If\nthe parties cannot agree, the owner has the right to request in writing a\nhearing within this initial 30-day period. If the owner does not request a\nhearing within 30 days of receipt of the notice provided for in this\nsubdivision, then such failure will be deemed a waiver of the right to a\nhearing and the department may proceed to issue a notice of violation to the\nowner and to the county. If the owner does request a hearing, the matter will\nbe referred to an Administrative Law Judge for scheduling a hearing in\naccordance with procedures of the State Administrative Procedure Act and Part\n622 of this Title. The owner and assessor or assessors shall be given notice of\nsuch hearing and an opportunity to be heard.

(d) Notwithstanding the finding of an\noccurrence described in paragraph (2), (3) or (4) of subdivision (c) of this\nsection, the department may determine that a violation has not occurred if the\nfailure to comply was due to reasons beyond the control of the owner and such\nfailure can be corrected forthwith without significant effect on the overall\npurpose of the management plan. (e) A notice of violation issued under this section shall be given by the\ndepartment to the owner, to the appropriate assessor(s), and to the county\ntreasurer of the county or counties in which such tract is located.
