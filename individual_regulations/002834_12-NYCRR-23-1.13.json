  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-1.13 - Electrical hazards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Operations subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission. None\nof the provisions of this section shall apply to or in connection with\noperations conducted by employers, owners, contractors and their agents subject\nto the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission. (b) General. (1)\n\nPrecautions. All power lines and power\nfacilities around or near construction, demolition and excavation sites shall\nbe considered as energized until assurance has been given that they are\notherwise by qualified representatives of the owners of such power lines or\npower facilities. (2)\n\nDetermination\nof voltages. Before work is begun at any construction, demolition or excavation\nsite, the employer shall determine the voltage levels of all energized power\nlines and power facilities around or near such site. Where two or more voltages\nare available at a job site, all electrical equipment and circuits shall be\nappropriately identified. Such identification shall include voltage level and\nphase. (3)\n\nInvestigation and\nwarning. Before work is begun the employer shall ascertain by inquiry or direct\nobservation, or by instruments, whether any part of an electric power circuit, exposed or concealed, is so located that the performance of the work may bring\nany person, tool or machine into physical or electrical contact therewith. The\nemployer shall post and maintain proper warning signs where such a circuit\nexists. He shall advise his employees of the locations of such lines, the\nhazards involved and the protective measures to be taken. (4)\n\nProtection of employees. No employer\nshall suffer or permit an employee to work in such proximity to any part of an\nelectric power circuit that he may contact such circuit in the course of his\nwork unless the employee is protected against electric shock by de-energizing\nthe circuit and grounding it or by guarding such circuit by effective\ninsulation or other means. In work areas where the exact locations of\nunderground electric power lines are unknown, persons using jack hammers, bars\nor other hand tools which may contact such power lines shall be provided with\ninsulated protective gloves, body aprons and footwear. (5)\n\nGuarding of switches or other circuit\ninterrupting devices. If protection for employees consists of de-energizing\ncircuits, employers shall cause open switches or other circuit interrupting\ndevices to be guarded against inadvertent closing until such employees are no\nlonger exposed. (6)\n\nNotifying\nutility company. At least five normal working days before work is begun within\n10 feet of any live overhead power line or before any excavation work is\nperformed which might contact or disturb a live underground power line, the\nemployer shall notify in writing the utility whose power line may be\naffected. (7)\n\nGenerators. Portable\nelectric power generators on any construction, demolition or excavation job\nsite shall have the frames and one pole of the electrical outputs\ngrounded. (8)\n\nDefective insulation. Any wiring found to have cracked insulation or insulation deteriorated in any\nother way shall be immediately removed from service and discarded. (c) Temporary electric power\ncircuits at construction, demolition or excavation job sites. (1)\n\nTemporary electric wiring. (i) All temporary wiring shall be supported\non proper insulators and not looped over nails or brackets. No bare wires or\nother unprotected current-carrying parts shall be located within eight feet\nabove any surface where persons may work or pass unless completely guarded by a\nfence or other barrier. Exception:Where qualified persons must make adjustments\nor measurements on an electrical device or circuit. (ii)\n\nElectrical systems and current-carrying\nequipment shall be properly grounded except as provided for blasting circuits\nin this Part (rule). Where it is necessary to lay electrical wiring on the\nground, such wiring shall be of the weather-proof type and heavy enough to\nwithstand the wear and abuse to which it may be subjected. No conductor shall\nbe used to carry a higher voltage than the manufacturer's rating. (iii)\n\nElevated power lines shall have\nsufficient vertical clearance where they cross highways, access roads or areas\ntraveled by trucks, cranes, shovels or other similar equipment. In no case\nshall such vertical clearance be less than 18 feet. (iv)\n\nFuses and other automatic cut-outs shall\nnot exceed a size that will cause open circuits at points lower than the\ncarrying capacities of the protected conductors or equipment or their\ninsulation. (d) High-voltage power circuits (over 300\nvolts to ground) at construction, demolition and excavation sites. (1)\n\nAt any construction, demolition or\nexcavation site where any person or equipment is required to approach nearer\nthan 10 feet to any overhead energized high-voltage power line or power\nfacility, such approach shall not be made unless or until the following\nprocedure has been complied with: (i) The\nowner of such power line or power facility shall be notified in writing by the\nemployer that such an approach is to be made. (ii)\n\nIn not more than one normal working day\nfollowing the receipt of such written notice, the owner of the high-voltage\npower line or power facility shall advise and make recommendations for the\nprocedure to be followed in performing any work nearer than 10 feet to such\npower line or power facility. Exception:In an emergency situation involving imminent\ndanger to the life, health or safety of any person the employer is not required\nto comply with this provision. (iii)\n\nThe employer shall follow the procedure\nrecommended by the owner of the high-voltage power line or power facility in\nperforming any work within 10 feet of such power line or power\nfacility. (2)\n\nThe\nprocedure outlined in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii), above, shall be\nfollowed whenever any excavation work is to be performed in any area where\nunderground high-voltage power circuits are known or expected to\nexist. (3)\n\nAny equipment used on a\nconstruction, demolition or excavation site which could approach nearer than 10\nfeet of an energized electric power line or power facility, located overhead or\nunderground, shall be effectively grounded as follows: (i) Any such equipment shall be provided with\na permanent clamp or other means for convenient and effective attachment to a\ngrounding conductor. (ii)\n\nThe cable\nconnecting the clamp to the ground shall be equivalent to a No. 1 AWG or larger\nsingle conductor, extraflexible, rope-stranded copper, with 600-volt covering\nfor abrasive protection, and with terminal parts that insure a proper\nconnection with hand-type screw clamps. (iii)\n\nAn effective ground for such equipment\nshall be one having a measured resistance of 25 ohms or less, or a connection\nto a continuous underground metallic water piping system. (4)\n\nAny machinery or equipment used on a\nconstruction, demolition or excavation site which has a boom or similar moving\nextension shall be provided with a durable warning sign posted and maintained\nin such a location as to be clearly visible to the operator of such machinery\nor equipment from his operating position. Every such warning sign shall bear\nthe following legend in black letters on a yellow background: Image\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
