Tit. 18 § 516.3 - Effect and enforcement of the penalty\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThe\nimposition of a penalty under this Part does not preclude the recovery of an\noverpayment or the imposition of any other penalty authorized by Federal or\n\nState law or regulation. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding the imposition of any penalty under this Part, the department\nmay also sanction a person pursuant to Part 515 of this\n\nTitle. (b) Collection of\npenalties. (1)\n\nWhen the person against whom a\npenalty was imposed does not pay the penalty, the department may recover the\namount of the penalty in the same manner as the recovery of an overpayment as\nset forth in Part 518 of this Title or by any other means authorized by\nstatute, or the rules and regulations of the department. (2)\n\nInterest will accrue on the amount of the\npenalty commencing on the 90th day after the date of OMIG's notice of agency\naction. Interest will accrue at the rate set forth in section\n518.4\n(c) of this\n\nTitle. Interest may be waived in whole or in part when OMIG determines the\nimposition of interest would effect an unjust result, would unduly burden the\nprovider or would substantially delay the prompt and efficient resolution of an\noutstanding audit or investigation.
