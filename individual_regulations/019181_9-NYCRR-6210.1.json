  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6210.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept to the extent set forth below, the definitions\ncontained in section 6209 of this Title shall apply in this section\n(a) Pre-qualification test\nis a test prescribed by the State Board, conducted immediately prior to the\nvoting systems' use in an election in which a predetermined set of votes are\ncast which will ensure that all voting positions for each ballot configuration\nare tested. Such votes shall be entered into the voting system in the same\nmanner as they will be entered by voters during an election. If a voting system\noffers several methods for votes to be entered, such as touch-screen, push-button, or other electronic mechanism, a key pad and/or pneumatic switch\nfor voters with disabilities, or alternate language displays, then a\npre-determined set of votes shall be entered separately using each method and\nlanguage display. The results of the casting of said votes and all voting\nsystem logs shall be extracted from the system as though during normal use in\nan election, and the results and logs shall be compared to the predetermined\nresults of the test votes and vote totals prepared pursuant to regulations and\nprocedures of the State Board. (b) Printout\nmeans either the printed copy of zero totals, candidate names and offices and other information produced by the voting\nequipment prior to the official opening of the polls or the printed tabulation\nreport of votes cast for each candidate and question, the names of candidates\nand the offices for each candidate and other information provided after the\nofficial closing of the polls. (c) Election mode. An operational setting and/or functional level of a voting\nsystem that would allow the user, under the required conditions stated by law, to make selections, and/or cast a ballot, and which also uniquely provides the\npotential to have a marked ballot officially accepted for counting at the time\nof a defined election. Note: This mode of operation may also\nbe synonymous with the term \"live vote mode\" or similar. This mode may also be\nrun at any time, either for the running of realistic simulations for testing, and/or after various maintenance activities. This mode is specifically required\nto be run in the conduct of an official election. (d) Test mode. An operational setting and/or functional level of a voting\nsystem that would allow the user to specify/select, access, and/or test various\nlevels/areas of the device, either, for example, during possible upgrades, diagnostic testing, and/or specific maintenance activities that may not require\nfull functional simulation, or capabilities at that time. Note: This mode of operation is a separate option from\nelection mode, and is prohibited from being run in the conduct of an official\nelection. (e) Closed\nnetwork. A closed network is a stand-alone server that is used for a\nspecific purpose, such as an election management system (EMS), and to which\naccess is restricted to specific workstations and users and not connected to\nany other internal or external network.
