  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 34-1.6 - Disclosure form\n\nState Regulations\nNOTICE TO PATIENTS\nBecause of concerns that there may be a conflict of interest when a physician refers a patient to a health care facility in which the physician has a financial interest, New York State passed a law. The law prohibits me, with certain exceptions, from referring you for clinical laboratory services, pharmacy services, radiation therapy, or X-ray or imaging services to a facility in which I or any of my immediate family members have a financial interest. If certain of the exceptions in the law apply, or if I am referring you for other than clinical laboratory, pharmacy, radiation therapy services, or x-ray or imaging services, I can make the referral under one condition. The condition is that I disclose this financial interest and tell you about alternative providers where you may go to obtain these services. This disclosure is intended to help you make a fully informed decision about your health care. I or my immediate family members have a financial relationship with the following providers: __________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________\n__________________________________________________\nFor more information about alternative providers, please ask me or my staff. We will provide you with names and addresses of providers best suited to your individual needs that are nearest to your home or place of work. Name of Physician\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n34-1.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
