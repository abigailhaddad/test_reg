(b) Upon\nrequest, an appellant or the contractor may have the fair hearing rescheduled\nto another date upon a showing of good cause. (c) The hearing officer may adjourn the\nhearing when he/she believes that due process rights of an appellant would best\nbe served by adjourning the fair hearing or if there are special circumstances\nwhich make proceeding with the case fundamentally unfair. (d) Requests to adjourn a fair hearing made\nprior to the date of the fair hearing must be made to the department in\naccordance with the instructions in the notice of fair hearing. Requests for\nadjournments made on the day of the fair hearing must be made on the record to\nthe hearing officer. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
