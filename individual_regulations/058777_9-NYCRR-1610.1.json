  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1610.1 - The site\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Selection\nand conformity with a plan. Sites for projects are selected with regard to municipal\nplans, where such exist. They are to be developed \"in conformity with a plan or\nundertaking for the clearance, replanning, reconstruction or rehabilitation of\na substandard and insanitary area or areas and for recreational and other\nfacilities incidental or appurtenant thereto\". (b) Zoning. The project shall comply with all required zoning. (c) Utilities. (1)\n\nInsofar as possible, projects must make\nuse of existing services and utilities; if these are not adequate, consult the\nprovisions of the loan and subsidy contract. (2)\n\nStorm and sanitary sewers or combined\nsewers shall be accessible to the site, or other acceptable provisions shall be\nmade for the disposition of storm water and sewerage. (3)\n\nAn adequate supply of water for drinking, household and fire protection purposes at adequate pressure must be available\nor must be made available to the project site. (4)\n\nStreet and yard lighting must be such as\nwill provide for safety and convenience. (d) Traffic and access. (1)\n\nIt is not desirable that the site be\ndivided by heavy traffic arteries. (2)\n\nRoads within a project site should be so\nlaid out as to insure privacy and discourage through traffic, while adequate\nfor necessary circulation and services. They should be designed and constructed\nso that they may be dedicated to the municipality for maintenance. (3)\n\nVehicular access ways may be not more\nthan 200 feet from the entrance to a building or dwelling unit. Access for\nfire-fighting equipment must be provided. Approval of the number and locations\nof, and access to, hydrants must be obtained from the local department having\njurisdiction before final site plans will be approved. (4)\n\nAdequate parking space must be provided. Parking shall be in accordance with local laws and ordinances. (5)\n\nIncinerators are not recommended except\nfor apartment buildings at least three stories in height. Row houses shall have\ngarbage stations with proper access roads. (e) Coverage and density. (1)\n\nCoverage must not exceed 30 per cent of\nthe net area within property lines of land acquired for immediate development. (Net site area\nis the area in square feet of the property\nproposed to be acquired, together with the area of the streets to be closed and\nother public properties incorporated in the project, but excluding streets to\nbe left open, proposed new streets and land to be ceded or reserved for street\nwidening or other purposes.)\n(2)\n\nIn\ndetermining density, consideration should always be given to all factors\naffecting the amenity value of space within or surrounding the project. The\ndensity to which a site may be developed will depend on its relation to\nexisting population densities and the nature of surrounding improvements. The\npreference of the division is for the lowest density compatible with an\neconomical use of land. In the case of a given site, decisions as to how many\nfamilies can best be housed per acre, and as to the use of single family houses\nand row houses, flats or multiple dwellings, should be made with reference to\nthe city plan as a whole, as well as with reference to the land cost per\ndwelling unit of the site. (3)\n\nOn\ninexpensive land, with good topography, and without water or rock conditions, single family houses and row houses usually are preferable; on other sites, multi-story structures are recommended. (f) Minimum distances between\nbuildings. (1)\n\nColumn (A)-: Minimum distances between parallel longitudinal\nwalls. Column (B)-: Minimum distances between longitudinal walls and end\nwalls; two end walls; corners of adjacent buildings; and between longitudinal\nwalls and interior lot lines. (2)\n\nWhen longitudinal walls are not parallel, the walls nearest to each other shall be required to be separated by the\nminimum distances in column (B), but the average distance between such walls\nshall be not less than column (A). For structures of different heights, these\ndistances shall be averaged. Story height\nA\nB\n1\n46\n31\n2\n50\n34\n3\n54\n36\n4\n58\n39\n5\n62\n41\n6\n66\n44\n7\n70\n47\n8\n74\n50\n9\n78\n52\n10\n82\n55\n11\n86\n58\n12\n90\n60\n13\n94\n63\n14\n98\n66\n15\n102\n68\n16\n106\n71\n17\n110\n74\n18\n114\n76\n19\n118\n79\n20\n122\n82\n21\n126\n84\n(3)\n\nOrientation for sun and prevailing summer\nwinds should be given due consideration. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n1610.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
