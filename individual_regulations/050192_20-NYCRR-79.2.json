Provided, however, if a package of cigarettes contains more than 20 cigarettes, the rate of tax on those cigarettes in excess of 20 increased from 683/4 cents\nto $1.0875 for each five cigarettes or fraction thereof. (b) Every dealer of cigarettes, including\nagents licensed to purchase and affix stamps, shall take a physical inventory\nof all cigarettes possessed in this State as of the close of business on June\n30, 2010. In addition, every dealer who is a licensed agent shall take a\nphysical inventory of all unaffixed cigarette tax stamps possessed as of the\nclose of business on such date. Because it may be impossible to take a physical\ninventory of cigarettes in all vending machines that are on location throughout\nthe State, a dealer may take as many physical inventories of the contents of\nsuch machines as is possible with available personnel. For those machines that\ncannot be physically inventoried as of the close of business on June 30, 2010, cigarettes may be accounted for at one-half of the normal fill capacities of\nsuch machines, as reflected in the individual inventory records maintained for\nsuch machines. (c) Returns\nand payments. (1)\n\nOn or before\n\nSeptember 20, 2010, every such dealer shall file a return with the Department\nof Taxation and Finance, on a form prescribed by the department for such\npurpose, showing the quantity of all cigarettes and unaffixed stamps possessed\nas of the June 30, 2010, close of business inventory. Such return must reflect\nthe entire wholesale and/or retail inventories of the dealer within the State, as required by the department, regardless of the number of business locations\nof the dealer. Every dealer must pay, with the filing of such return, an\nadditional amount of tax for all cigarettes in such inventory which are\ncontained in packages bearing stamps evidencing tax payment at the rates in\neffect prior to July 1, 2010, and for all unaffixed cigarette tax stamps in\nsuch inventory evidencing tax payment at such rates. The additional amount of\ntax shall be paid at the rate of $1.60 for each 20 cigarettes or fraction\nthereof unless cigarettes are contained in packages of more than 20, in which\ncase the additional amount of tax for those cigarettes in excess of 20 shall be\nat the rate of 40 cents for each five cigarettes or fraction thereof ($2.00 per\npackage of 25 cigarettes). Such tax shall be paid regardless of whether the\naffixed or unaffixed stamps show payment of the New York State tax or both the\n\nNew York State and City of New York taxes. (2)\n\nThe additional amount of tax due on\ninventory based on the increased cigarette tax must be paid by check or money\norder, payable to NYS Cigarette Tax. (d) Failure to file a return on cigarette and\ncigarette tax stamp inventory or to pay the additional amount of tax due\nthereon, or failure to comply with any provision of this section may result in\ncivil or criminal sanctions, or both.
