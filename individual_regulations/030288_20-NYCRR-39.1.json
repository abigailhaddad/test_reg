  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 39.1 - Recordkeeping\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nEvery taxpayer must keep complete and\nadequate records as may be necessary in order to determine the proper tax\nand/or fee due and/or to determine the information required to be reported. Such records must be retained so long as they may be or may become material in\nthe administration of article 9, 9-A, 13, 32, 33 or 33-A of the Tax Law. The\nterm taxpayer as used in this section means a person, within the meaning of\nsection\n1080 (b)(3)\nof the Tax Law, subject to a tax and/or fee imposed by article 9, 9-A, 13, 32, 33 or 33-A of\nthe Tax Law and/or required to file a return of information as provided for by\nany such article. (2)\n\nEvery\ntaxpayer must keep permanent books of account or records, including inventories\nand other pertinent data, as are sufficient to establish the amount of\nreceipts, premiums, gross income, assets, capital, gain, loss, deductions, credits or other matters required to be shown by such taxpayer in any report or\nreturn required by any such article. Such records must be dated, legible and\nmaintained and preserved in such manner as to disclose in readily accessible\nand verifiable detail the basis and accuracy of the entries reported. All\nretained records must be clearly labeled and should be stored in a secure\nenvironment. A taxpayer may elect to retain records as hard-copy records, electronic records, or both. See Part 2402 of this Title for taxpayer record\nretention formats. Additional requirements are provided for in subdivision (b)\nof this section for taxpayers which maintain or process records on an Automated\n\nData Processing (ADP) system. References to ADP systems include all accounting\nsystems and/or financial systems and subsystems which process all or part of a\ntaxpayer's transactions, records or other pertinent data by other than manual\nmethods. (3)\nA taxpayer may retain\nthe records described in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, that are created or\nreceived in the ordinary course of business, on microfilm (including\nmicrofiche) provided the following requirements are met: (i) the procedures governing the\nestablishment of a microfilm system and the individuals who are responsible for\nmaintaining and operating the microfilm system, with appropriate authorization\nfrom the Board of Directors, general partner(s), or owner, whichever is\napplicable, must be set forth in writing; (ii)\nthe microfilm system must be complete\nand must be used consistently in the regularly conducted activity of the\nbusiness; (iii)\nprocedures with\nappropriate documentation must be established so the original document can be\nfollowed through the micrographic system; (iv)\ninternal procedures for inspection and\nquality assurance must be established; (v) the taxpayer is responsible for the\neffective identification, processing, storage, and preservation of microfilm, making it readily available for as long as the contents may become material in\nthe administration of article 9, 9- A, 13, 32, 33 or 33-A of the Tax\n\nLaw; (vi)\na record must be kept of\nwhere, when, by whom, and on what equipment the microfilm was\nproduced; (vii)\nwhen displayed on a\nmicrofilm reader (viewer) or reproduced on paper, the material must exhibit a\nhigh degree of legibility and readability. For this purpose, legibility is\ndefined as the quality of a letter or numeral that enables the observer to\nidentify it positively and quickly to the exclusion of all other letters or\nnumerals. Readability is defined as the quality of a group of letters or\nnumerals being recognizable as words or complete numbers; (viii)\na detailed index of all microfilmed\ndata must be maintained and arranged in a manner that permits the immediate\nlocation of any particular record; and\n(ix)\nthe taxpayer must make available upon\nrequest a reader/printer in good working order at the examination site for\nreading, locating and reproducing any record maintained on microfilm. (4)\n\nEvery taxpayer should make\nperiodic checks on all records being retained for use by the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance. If any records required to be retained are subsequently\nlost, destroyed, damaged, or found to be incomplete or materially inaccurate, the taxpayer must recreate the files within a reasonable period of\ntime. (5)\n\nEvery taxpayer must make\navailable to the Department of Taxation and Finance upon request any records\ndescribed in this section, together with tax returns, including supporting\nschedules, filed with the Federal government, and supporting documents related\nthereto. Additionally, every taxpayer must provide the representative of such\ndepartment with suitable facilities for conducting an audit or\nexamination. (6)\n\nThe Commissioner\nof Taxation and Finance may enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to modify\nor waive any or all of the specific requirements of this section if hardship is\nshown in an application filed pursuant to this paragraph and the recordkeeping\nunder such agreement permits the taxpayer and the department to accurately\ndetermine the taxpayer's tax liability. Such taxpayer remains subject to all\nrequirements of this section that are not specifically modified or waived by\nsuch agreement. A request for modification or waiver shall be in writing and\nmust be filed at least 90 days before the beginning of the taxable year for\nwhich such modification or waiver is requested. In determining whether hardship\nhas been shown, the principal factor to be taken into account will be the\namount by which the cost of recordkeeping in accordance with this section\nexceeds the cost of recordkeeping employed or proposed to be employed by the\ntaxpayer. Additional factors to be considered include, but are not limited to: the presence of a pre-existing agreement between the taxpayer and the Internal\n\nRevenue Service regarding record retention for Federal income tax purposes and\nany unusual circumstances. If the commissioner grants a modification or waiver, the commissioner shall specify the period of time to which it applies and shall\nalso prescribe the method of recordkeeping to be utilized. (b) Records prepared by ADP systems. (1)\n\nThis subdivision applies to taxpayers\nthat process or maintain records on ADP systems. These specific provisions\nsupplement Part 2402 of this Title concerning taxpayer record retention\nformats. (i) (a) This subdivision applies to taxpayers\nwhich process or maintain records on an ADP system if: (1)\nthe assets (valued at cost) of the\ntaxpayer equal $10,000,000 or more at any time during the previous taxable\nyear; or\n(2)\nsuch level of assets\nis not reached but either of the conditions provided for in subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph are met. (b) In the case of a group of corporations\nwhich file a combined report, this subdivision also applies to the taxpayers in\nsuch combined group which process or maintain records on an ADP system if: (1)\nthe assets (valued at cost) of the\ncombined group of corporations when aggregated equal $10,000,000 or more at any\ntime during the previous taxable year; or\n(2)\nsuch level of assets is not reached by\nthe combined group of corporations but either of the conditions provided for in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph are met. (ii)\n\nTaxpayers which process or maintain\nrecords on an ADP system and do not have assets (valued at cost) equal to\n$10,000,000 or more at any time during the previous taxable year or are members\nof a combined group whose assets when aggregated do not reach such level shall\ncomply with the provisions of this subdivision if either of the following\nconditions exist: (a) information required by\nsubdivision (a) of this section is not in the hard- copy books and records, but\nis available in machine-sensible records; or\n(b) machine-sensible records were used for\ncomputations that cannot be reasonably verified or recomputed without using a\ncomputer (e.g., Last-In, First-Out [LIFO] inventories). (2)\n\nAll machine-sensible records\nmust be retained and such records must be in a retrievable format that provides\nthe information necessary to determine the proper tax and/or fee due and/or to\ndetermine the information required to be reported. The utilization of a service\nbureau, time-sharing service or value added network does not relieve the\ntaxpayer of its responsibilities as described in this subdivision. (3)\n(i) Documentation that provides a complete description of the ADP portion of the\naccounting system, including all subsystems and files that feed into the\naccounting system, must be retained and made available to the department upon\nrequest. Statements and illustrations as to the scope of the operations should\nbe sufficiently detailed to indicate: (a) the\napplication being performed; (b) the procedures employed in each application; (c) the controls used to ensure accurate and\nreliable processing; and\n(d) the\ncontrols used to prevent the unauthorized addition, alteration, or deletion of\nretained records. (ii)\n\nThe following specific documentation for all retained files shall also be kept: (a) record formats (including the meaning of\nall \"codes\" used to represent information); (b) flowcharts for a system and a\nprogram; (c) label\ndescriptions; (d) source program\nlistings of programs that created the retained files; (e) detailed charts of accounts (for specific\nperiods); (f) evidence that\nperiodic checks of the retained records that are prescribed in paragraph (a)(4)\nof this section were performed; and\n(g) evidence that the retained records\nreconcile to the books and the tax report or return. This reconciliation shall\nestablish the relationship between the total of the amounts in the retained\nrecords by account to the account totals in the books and to the tax report or\nreturn. (4)\n\nAny change to the ADP system which affects the accounting system and/or\nsubsystems, together with their effective dates, shall be documented in order\nto preserve an accurate chronological record. This record should include any\nchanges to software or systems and any changes to the formats of\nfiles. (5)\n\nEvery taxpayer must be\nable to process the retained records at the time of a department examination. Processing shall include the ability to print a hardcopy of any record. When\nthe data processing system that created the records is being replaced by a\nsystem with which the records would be incompatible, the taxpayer shall convert\npre-existing records to a format that is compatible with the new\nsystem. (6)\n\nEvery taxpayer shall\nprovide the department, at the time of an examination, with computer resources\n(e.g., terminal access, computer time and personnel) that are necessary for the\nprocessing of the retained records. (7)\n\nEvery taxpayer which utilizes a Data Base\n\nManagement System (DBMS), a software system that creates, controls, retrieves, and provides accessibility to data stored in a data base, must create a\nsequential file(s) that contains all the detail necessary to identify the\nunderlying source documents. In addition to the documentation described in\nparagraphs (3) and (4) of this subdivision, the following documentation\npertaining to each DBMS system must be retained: (i) Data Base Description (DBD); (ii)\nrecord layout of each segment with\nrespect to the fields in the segment; (iii)\nsystems control language; (iv)\n\nProgram Specification Block (PSB); and\n(v) Program Communication Block\n(PCB). (8)\n(i) Every taxpayer which utilizes Electronic\n\nData Interchange (EDI) technology, the computer-to-computer exchange of\nbusiness information, must retain machine-sensible records that, in combination\nwith any other records (e.g., the underlying contracts, price lists, and price\nchanges), contain all of the detailed information required by subdivision (a)\nof this section. The extent of the detail in the retained electronic and other\nrecords, if any, must be equivalent to the level of detail contained in an\nacceptable paper record. For example, the retained records for an electronic\ninvoice must contain identification of the vendor by name, invoice date, product description, quantity purchased and price. The taxpayer may capture\nthis information at any level within the accounting system provided the audit\ntrail, authenticity, and integrity of the retained records can be\nestablished. (ii)\n\nHardcopy records\ngenerated at the time of a transaction (e.g., credit card receipts) need not be\nretained if all the details relating to the transaction are subsequently\nreceived by the taxpayer in an EDI transaction and are retained by the taxpayer\nin accordance with this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n39.1\n\nThis section shall take effect immediately, except that\nthe specific requirements contained in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3), and\nsubdivision (b) shall take effect on January 1, 1993. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
