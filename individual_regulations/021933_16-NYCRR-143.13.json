Tit. 16 § 143.13 - Survey of residential customers previously disconnected for nonpayment or theft of service\n\nState Regulations\n\nNot earlier than September 1 nor later than November 1 of\nevery year, each electric corporation and gas and electric corporation shall\nconduct a survey of all former residential customers whose electric service was\nused for heating the premises or operating a heating system, was terminated for\nnonpayment, meter or service lateral tampering, or theft of service during the\n12-month period ending on November 1 of that year, and has not been restored. The purpose of the survey is to determine whether a continued lack of service\nmay expose the former customer or other person residing in the premises to a\nserious impairment to human health as defined in subdivision (b) of section\n143.12\nof this Part. If the\ncorporation determines that a former residential customer or other person\nresiding in the premises may be exposed to a serious impairment to human health\nas defined in subdivision (b) of section\n143.12\nof this Part, it shall\nrestore the electric service immediately, unless the customer refuses to permit\nsuch corporation to restore service or, in theft or tampering situations, unless it is impractical for the corporation to eliminate an unsafe condition, and the requirements of subdivision (b) of section\n143.12\nof this Part shall apply. If the corporation is unable to obtain personal contact with the customer or an\nadult residing on the premises or the customer refuses to permit service\nrestoration, it shall immediately refer the name and address of the former\ncustomer to the local commissioner of social services in accordance with the\nprocedures set forth in paragraph (b)(3) of section\n143.12\nof this Part, unless the\ncorporation has reasonable grounds to believe that the former customer has\npermanently vacated the premises.
