Part 38)\n\nIntroduction\n\nFor each radionuclide, Table I indicates the chemical form\nwhich is to be used for selecting the appropriate ALI or DAC value. The ALIs\nand DACs for inhalation are given for an aerosol with an activity median\naerodynamic diameter (AMAD) of 1 1/4m, (micron) and for three classes (D,W,Y)\nof radioactive material, which refer to their retention (approximately days, weeks or years) in the pulmonary region of the lung. This classification\napplies to a range of clearance half-times for D if less than 10 days, for W\nfrom 10 to 100 days, and for Y greater than 100 days. Table II provides\nconcentration limits for airborne and liquid effluents released to the general\nenvironment. Table III provides concentration limits for discharges to sanitary\nsewerage. Note: The values in Tables I, II and III are\npresented in the computer \"E\"notation. In this notation a value of 6E-02\nrepresents a value of 6 ×10\n-2\nor 0.06, 6E\n+2\nrepresents 6 × 10\n2\nor 600, and 6E + 0 represents 6\n×10\n0\nor 6. TABLE I \"OCCUPATIONAL VALUES\"\nNote that the columns in Table I of this Appendix captioned\n\"Oral Ingestion ALI,\" \"Inhalation ALI,\" and \"AC,\"are applicable to occupational\nexposure to radioactive material. The ALIs in this Appendix are the annual intakes of given\nradionuclide by \"Reference Man\" which would result in either (1) a committed\neffective dose equivalent of 0.05 Sv (5 rem), stochastic ALI, or (2) a\ncommitted dose equivalent of 0.5 Sv (50 rem) to an organ or tissue, nonstochastic ALI. The stochastic ALIs were derived to result in a risk, due to\nirradiation of organs and tissues, comparable to the risk associated with deep\ndose equivalent to the whole body of 0.05 Sv (5 rem). The derivation includes\nmultiplying the committed dose equivalent to an organ or tissue by a weighting\nfactor, w\nT. This weighting factor is the proportion of\nthe risk of stochastic effects resulting from irradiation of the organ or\ntissue, T, to the total risk of stochastic effects when the whole body is\nirradiated uniformly. The values of w\nT\nare listed under\nthe definition of weighting factor in section\n38.3\nof this Part (Rule). The\nnonstochastic ALIs were derived to avoid nonstochastic effects, such as prompt\ndamage to tissue or reduction in organ function. A value of w\nT\n= 0.06 is applicable to\neach of the five organs or tissues in the \"remainder\" category receiving the\nhighest dose equivalents, and the dose equivalents of all other remaining\ntissues may be disregarded. The following portions of the GI tract-stomach, small intestine, upper large intestine, and lower large intestine-are to be\ntreated as four separate organs. Note that the dose equivalents for an extremity, skin, and lens\nof the eye are not considered in computing the committed effective dose\nequivalent, but are subject to limits that must be met separately. When an ALI is defined by the stochastic dose limit, this value\nalone is given. When an ALI is determined by the nonstochastic dose limit to an\norgan, the organ or tissue to which the limit applies is shown, and the ALI for\nthe stochastic limit is shown in parentheses. Abbreviated organ or tissue\ndesignations are used: LLI wall = lower large intestine wall; St wall =stomach wall; Blad wall = bladder wall; and Bone surf =bone surface. The use of the ALIs listed first, the more limiting of the\nstochastic and nonstochastic ALIs, will ensure that nonstochastic effects' are\navoided and that the risk of stochastic effects is limited to an acceptably low\nvalue. If, in a particular situation involving a radionuclide for which the\nnonstochastic ALI is limiting, use of that nonstochastic ALI is considered\nunduly conservative, the licensee may use the stochastic ALI to determine the\ncommitted effective dose equivalent. However, the licensee shall also ensure\nthat the 0.5 Sv (50 rem) dose equivalent limit for any organ or tissue is not\nexceeded by the sum of the external deep dose equivalent plus the internal\ncommitted dose equivalent to that organ, not the effective dose. For the case\nwhere there is no external dose contribution, this would be demonstrated if the\nsum of the fractions of the nonstochastic ALIs (ALI\nns\n)\nthat contribute to the committed dose equivalent to the organ receiving the\nhighest dose does not exceed unity, that is, [SIGMA] (intake (in µCi) of\neach radionuclide/ALI\nns\n) <= 1.0. If there is an\nexternal deep dose equivalent contribution of H\nd, then\nthis sum must be less than 1- (H\nd\n/50), instead of <=\n1.0. The derived air concentration (DAC) values are derived limits\nintended to control chronic occupational exposures. The relationship between\nthe DAC and the ALI is given by: DAC =ALI (in µCi)/(2000 hours per working year × 60\nminutes/hour ×2 × 10\n4\nml per minute) =\n[ALI/2.4 ×10\n9\n] µCi/ml, where 2 ×10\n4\nml per minute is the volume of air\nbreathed per minute at work by Reference Man under working conditions of light\nwork. The DAC values relate to one of two modes of exposure: either\nexternal submersion or the internal committed dose equivalents resulting from\ninhalation of radioactive materials. DACs based upon submersion are for\nimmersion in a semiinfinite cloud of uniform concentration and apply to each\nradionuclide separately. The ALI and DAC values include contributions to exposure by the\nsingle radionuclide named and any in-growth of daughter radionuclides produced\nin the body by decay of the parent. However, intakes that include both the\nparent and daughter radionuclides should be treated by the general method\nappropriate for mixtures. The values of ALI and DAC do not apply directly when the\nindividual both ingests and inhales a radionuclide, when the individual is\nexposed to a mixture of radionuclides by either inhalation or ingestion or\nboth, or when the individual is exposed to both internal and external\nirradiation. See section\n38.18\n(b) of this\n\nPart (Rule). When an individual is exposed to radioactive materials which fall\nunder several of the translocation classifications of the same radionuclide, such as, Class D, Class W, or Class Y, the exposure may be evaluated as if it\nwere a mixture of different radionuclides. It should be noted that the classification of a compound as\n\nClass D, W, or Y is based on the chemical form of the compound and does not\ntake into account the radiological half-life of different radionuclides. For\nthis reason, values are given for Class D, W, and Y compounds, even for very\nshort- lived radionuclides. TABLE II \"EFFLUENT CONCENTRATIONS\"\nThe columns in Table II of this Appendix captioned \"Effluents,\"\n\"Air\"and \"Water\" are applicable to the assessment and control of dose to the\npublic, particularly in the implementation of the provisions of section\n38.19\n(b) of this\n\nPart (Rule). The concentration values given in Columns 1 and 2 of Table II are\nequivalent to the radionuclide concentrations which, if inhaled or ingested\ncontinuously over the course of a year, would produce a total effective dose\nequivalent of 0.50 mSv (0.05 rem). Consideration of nonstochastic limits has not been included in\nderiving the air and water effluent concentration limits because nonstochastic\neffects are presumed not to occur at or below the dose levels established for\nindividual members of the public. For radionuclides, where the nonstochastic\nlimit was governing in deriving the occupational DAC, the stochastic ALI was\nused in deriving the corresponding airborne effluent limit in Table II. For\nthis reason, the DAC and airborne effluent limits are not always\nproportional. The air concentration values listed in Table II, Column 1 were\nderived by one of two methods. For those radionuclides for which the stochastic\nlimit is governing, the occupational stochastic inhalation ALI was divided by\n2.4 ×10\n9, relating the inhalation ALI to the\nDAC, as explained above, and then divided by a factor of 300. The factor of 300\nincludes the following components: a factor of 50 to relate the 0.05 Sv (5 rem)\nannual occupational dose limit to the 0.1 rem limit for members of the public, a factor of 3 to adjust for the difference in exposure time and the inhalation\nrate for a worker and that for members of the public; and a factor of 2 to\nadjust the occupational values, derived for adults, so that they are applicable\nto other age groups. For those radionuclides for which submersion, that is external\ndose, is limiting, the occupational DAC in Table I, Column 3 was divided by\n219. The factor of 219 is composed of a factor of 50, as described above, and a\nfactor of 4.38 relating occupational exposure for 2,000 hours per year to full-\ntime exposure (8,760 hours per year). Note that an additional factor of 2 for\nage considerations is not warranted in the submersion case. The water concentrations were derived by taking the most\nrestrictive occupational stochastic oral ingestion ALI and dividing by 7.3\n× 10\n7. The factor of 7.3 × 10\n7\n(ml) includes the following\ncomponents: the factors of 50 and 2 described above and a factor of 7.3\n×10\n5\n(ml) which is the annual water intake\nof Reference Man. Note 2 of this Appendix provides groupings of radionuclides\nwhich are applicable to unknown mixtures of radionuclides. These groupings, including occupational inhalation ALIs and DACs, air and water effluent\nconcentrations and releases to sewer, require demonstrating that the most\nlimiting radionuclides in successive classes are absent. The limit for the\nunknown mixture is defined when the presence of one of the listed radionuclides\ncannot be definitely excluded as being present either from knowledge of the\nradionuclide composition of the source or from actual measurements. TABLE III \"RELEASES TO SEWERS\"\nThe concentration values contained in Table III were derived by\ntaking the most restrictive occupational stochastic oral ingestion ALI and\ndividing by 7.3 × 10\n6\n(ml). The factor of 7.3\n× 10\n6\n(ml) is composed of a factor of 7.3\n× 10\n5\n(ml), the annual water intake by\n\nReference Man, and a factor of 10, such that the concentrations, if the sewage\nreleased by the licensee were the only source of water ingested by a Reference\n\nMan during a year, would result in a committed effective dose equivalent of 0.5\nrem.

The total effective dose\nequivalent received during operations with these radionuclides might include a\nsignificant contribution from external exposure. The DAC values for all\nradionuclides, other than those designated Class \"Submersion,\" are based upon\nthe committed effective dose equivalent due to the intake of the radionuclide\ninto the body and do\nNOT\ninclude potentially significant\ncontributions to dose equivalent from external exposures. The licensee may\nsubstitute 1E-7 1/4Ci/ml for the listed DAC to account for the submersion dose\nprospectively, but should use individual monitoring devices or other radiation\nmeasuring instruments that measure external exposure to demonstrate compliance\nwith the limits. (See §\n38.18\n(c).)\n3\n\nFor soluble mixtures of U-238, U-234, and U-235 in air, chemical toxicity may be the limiting factor (see\n§\n38.18\n(a)(5)\n). If\nthe percent by weight (enrichment) of U-235 is not greater than 5, the\nconcentration value for a 40-hour workweek is 0.2 milligrams uranium per cubic\nmeter of air average. For any enrichment, the product of the average\nconcentration and time of exposure during a 40-hour workweek shall not exceed\n8E-3 (SA) 1/4Ci-hr/ml, where SA is the specific activity of the uranium\ninhaled. The specific activity for natural uranium is 6.77E-7 curies per gram\nU. The specific activity for other mixtures of U-238, U-235, and U-234, if not\nknown, shall be: SA = 3.6E-7 curies/gram U -depleted\nSA = [0.4 + 0.38 (enrichment) + 0.0034\n(enrichment)\n2\n] E-6, enrichment e0.72\nwhere enrichment is the percentage by weight of U-235, expressed as percent. NOTE: 1. If the identity of each radionuclide in a mixture is known\nbut the concentration of one or more of the radionuclides in the mixture is not\nknown, the DAC for the mixture shall be the most restrictive DAC of any\nradionuclide in the mixture. 2.

If a mixture of radionuclides consists of uranium and its\ndaughters in ore dust (101/4m AMAD particle distribution assumed) prior to\nchemical separation of the uranium from the ore, the following values may be\nused for the DAC of the mixture: 6E-11 1/4Ci of gross alpha activitity from\nuranium-238, uranium-234, thorium-230, and radium-226 per milliliter of air; 3E-11 1/4of natural uranium per milliliter of air; or 45 micrograms of natural\nuranium per cubic meter of air. 4. If the identity and concentration of each radionuclide in a\nmixture are known, the limiting values should be derived as follows: determine, for each radionuclide in the mixture, the ratio between the concentration\npresent in the mixture and the concentration otherwise established in Appendix\nB for the specific radionuclide when not in a mixture. The sum of such ratios\nfor all of the radionuclides in the mixture may not exceed \"1\"(i.e., \"unity\"). Example: If radionuclides \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" are present in\nconcentrations C\nA, C\nB, and\nC\nC, and if the applicable DACs are\nDAC\nA, DAC\nB, and\nDAC\nC, respectively, then the concentrations shall be\nlimited so that the following relationship exists: C\nA\n/DAC\nA\n+\nC\nB\n/DAC\nB\n+\nC\nC\n/DAC\nC\n<= 1\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
