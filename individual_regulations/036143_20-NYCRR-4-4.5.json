  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-4.5 - Reasonable approximation based on customer information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where a corporation's books and records\nkept in the ordinary course of business and reasonable inquiries to the\ncustomer when required do not provide adequate information for apportionment of\na receipt from a service or other business activity, then reasonable\napproximation must be used to determine where the benefit is\nreceived. (b) Definition. Reasonable approximation based on customer information is an alternative method\nused to determine the location or locations at which a customer receives the\nbenefit of a service or other business activity in instances in which: (1)\n(i) the\nlocation or locations where the benefit is received and/or the percentage of\nbenefit actually received in each location as a share of the total benefit\nreceived cannot be determined, or\n(ii)\nobtaining the location or locations\nwhere the benefit is received and/or the percentage of benefit received in each\nlocation as a share of the total benefit received would require the corporation\nto expend undue effort and expense beyond the due diligence required by this\n\nSubpart; and\n(2)\nthe\ncorporation has sufficient information to reasonably approximate the location\nor locations where the benefit is received and/or the percentage of benefit\nreceived in each location as a share of the total benefit received. (c) Application of reasonable\napproximation based on customer information. (1)\nA corporation must use all available\ninformation in its books and records, including information obtained upon\nreasonable inquiries where required, and information publicly available about\nthe location or locations where its actual customers receive the benefit of the\nservice or other business activity. (2)\n\nWhen a corporation is required under this\nsection to reasonably approximate, the corporation must use a method that is\nintended to approximate where the customer receives the benefit from the\nservice or other business activity. (3)\n\nSourced receipts method. In any instance\nwhere a corporation can ascertain the location or locations where a substantial\nportion of similar receipts are sourced ('sourced receipts\"), but not all of\nsuch receipts, and the corporation reasonably believes, based on all available\ninformation, that the geographic distribution of the remainder of such receipts\nis substantially similar to that of the sourced receipts, it may source such\nreceipts in the same proportion as its sourced receipts (\"the sourced receipts\nmethod\"). If the corporation reasonably believes, based on all available\ninformation, that the geographic distribution of the remainder of such receipts\nis different from that of the sourced receipts, and the corporation otherwise\nlacks sufficient information to use reasonable approximation either under this\nsection or section\n4-4.6\nof this Subpart, it must\nnext attempt to apportion such receipts using the delivery destination method\n(see section\n4-4.7\nof this Subpart). (4)\n\nIn any case in which a corporation uses a\nmethod of approximation to apportion its receipts and the commissioner\ndetermines that the method of approximation employed by the corporation is not\nreasonable, the commissioner may substitute a method of approximation that the\ncommissioner determines is appropriate. In this instance, the corporation bears\nthe burden of demonstrating that the method the commissioner prescribes is not\nreasonable. (5)\n\nIn any case in\nwhich the commissioner determines that a corporation's method of approximation\nis reasonable, but that it has not been applied in a consistent manner with\nrespect to similar transactions, the commissioner may require that the\ncorporation apply its method of approximation in a consistent manner. (6)\n\nIn any case in which, after reasonable\ninquiries are made when required, the corporation does not have sufficient\ninformation based on its actual customers to use reasonable approximation, the\ntaxpayer must next attempt to determine where the benefit is received using the\nrules for reasonable approximation based on general information.
