  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 554.3 - Cable tool drilling practices\n\nState Regulations\n(a) On all wells where cable tools are\nemployed, the surface casing shall be tested by bailing to insure a shutoff\nbefore drilling below the casing point proceeds. (b) Wellhead connections adequate to control\nblowouts will be employed. (c) Any\noil or gas encountered above the ultimate objective in sufficient quantities as\nto constitute a hazard or waste if permitted to escape must be shut off before\ndrilling proceeds deeper. Shutoff may be accomplished either by mudding, cementation or by the running of a string of casing. The hole must be tested by\nbailing to insure shutoff before drilling is resumed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n554.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
