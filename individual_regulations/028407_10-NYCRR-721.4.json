(iii)\n\nExcept in\nunusual circumstances, smaller and more premature infants shall be delivered at\nhigher level hospitals; if such an infant is born at a Level I perinatal care\nhospital, he/she shall be transferred promptly after birth. (iv)\n\nWomen and neonates who have relatively\nminor problems that do not require advanced laboratory, radiologic, or\nconsultation services may remain in the Level I perinatal care\nhospital. (v) When it is known that\nthe newborn may require immediate complex care, it shall be delivered at a\n\nLevel III perinatal care hospital or an RPC whenever possible. (vi)\n\nLevel I perinatal care hospitals shall\nalso provide care for convalescing babies who have been transferred from Level\nII, Level III and RPC perinatal care hospitals. (2)\nA Level II perinatal care services\nhospital shall: (i) provide the Level I\nperinatal care services described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision and be\ncapable of providing care for moderately high-risk women, fetuses and newborns\nand moderately ill women and newborns who have problems that do not require\nhighly specialized care; (ii)\nstabilize ill women and newborns and women whose fetuses are expected to need\ncomplex care, consult with a higher level hospital and arrange for timely\ntransfer to a hospital that provides the appropriate level of perinatal\ncare; (iii)\n\nLevel II perinatal care\nhospitals are qualified to deliver infants with an anticipated delivery at 30\nweeks gestation or later and with an anticipated birthweight of 1,250 grams or\nmore; and\n(iv)\nexcept in unusual\ncircumstances, infants smaller and more premature than is described at\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph shall be delivered at Level III hospitals\nor RPCs.

(5)\n\nThe transfer and consultation criterion\nincluded in the affiliation and transfer agreements can be customized to\nreflect the RPC's knowledge and the capabilities of each affiliate hospital. Any variation in transfer of patients to a higher level perinatal care service\nhospital as specified in this section must be in accordance with generally\naccepted standards of professional practice and criteria established in the\naffiliation agreement with each hospital's respective RPC. (b) Ventilation for distressed newborns. Resuscitation and ventilation of neonates who require cardiorespiratory\nassistance shall be performed at each level of perinatal care and in the\nfollowing ways: (1)\nat a Level I perinatal\ncare services hospital the ventilation of distressed newborns shall be\nimmediate resuscitation after birth as appropriate, stabilization, and assisted\nventilation of newborns until timely transfer to a hospital that provides a\nhigher level of perinatal care; (2)\nat a Level II perinatal care hospital the ventilation of a distressed newborn\nshall be as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision and, in addition, standard short-term mechanical ventilation. A Level II perinatal care hospital\nmay care for infants requiring mechanical ventilation and/or 50 percent or more\noxygen for no more than four days. By the fourth day of a newborn's receipt of\nassisted ventilation or oxygen at 50 percent or more, the Level II hospital\nshall consult with its designated RPC regarding the status of the newborn and\ndetermine whether to transfer the newborn to a higher level hospital. If after\nsuch consultation the neonate stays at the Level II hospital, that hospital may\nretain the neonate for no more than a total of seven days on assisted\nventilation or oxygen at 50 percent and must then transfer the neonate to a\n\nLevel III hospital or to an RPC unless the hospital's RPC is consulted and\nagrees that the neonate's care is appropriate and in accordance with current\nstandards of professional practice and remaining at the Level II hospital is in\nthe best interests of the neonate; and\n(3)\nat Level III perinatal care services\nhospitals and RPCs the ventilation of a distressed newborn shall be as\ndescribed in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision and, in addition, may\nalso include long-term standard mechanical ventilation and complex ventilation\ntechniques, such as high-frequency ventilation and extracorporeal membrane\noxygenation (ECMO). (c) Transfers. (1)\n\nAll patient care and transfers\nshall be in accordance with generally accepted professional standards and be\nconsistent with section\n405.21\n(g) and\nthis Title. Requirements for consultation and for transfer to a higher level of\nperinatal care and transfer back to the referring hospital or other hospital\nproviding a lower level of care, shall be described in any transfer agreement\nnegotiated between Level I, II and III perinatal care hospitals, and in\ntransfer provisions in the perinatal affiliation agreements between Level I, II\nand III perinatal care hospitals and their RPCs. (2)\n\nWhen a newborn and/or mother requires\ntransfer, care shall be provided at a hospital providing the appropriate level\nof perinatal care which is, whenever feasible, accessible and convenient to the\nmother's place of residence.

Level III hospitals and RPCs shall return a newborn to the sending hospital\nwhen the condition has been stabilized and return is medically\nappropriate. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
