  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 360-5.4 - Reapplication\n\nState Regulations\n\nReapplication for MA as disabled is processed as any\nother reapplication. (a) When an\nindividual reapplies after he/she has been certified as disabled by an MA-only\ndisability review team, group I or group II, and his/her case is closed for\nreasons unrelated to a change in disability (e.g., increased pension or other\nbenefits), there is no need for a disability review team evaluation unless: (1)\n12 months or more have elapsed since date\nof last case closing; (2)\nthe\nindividual has, in the interim, engaged in a useful occupation; and\n(3)\nthe individual has, in the interim, had a\nsignificant change in treatment such as major surgery, a stay in a\nrehabilitation center or a period of diagnostic hospitalization. (b) Cases reopened as group II in\naccordance with the instruction listed in this section, without review team\nreview, must be reviewed on the date which had been set before the case was\nclosed. If reapplication of group II cases occurs subsequent to the date set\nfor review by the review team, the agency must secure and transmit any\nadditional data requested at previous review and all required forms previously\nsubmitted. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§§\n360-5.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
