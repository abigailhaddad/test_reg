  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 52.29 - Rules relating to the replacement of accident and health insurance coverage with individual long term care insurance, nursing home insurance only, home care insurance only, or nursing home and home care insurance policies and the purchase of multiple accident and health policies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Application forms shall include a question designed to elicit information as to whether a long term care insurance, nursing home insurance only, home care insurance only, or nursing home and home care insurance policy is intended to replace any other accident and health insurance policy presently in force. The application form must require a list of all existing accident and health insurance policies and require identification of those being replaced. (b) The application for long term care insurance, nursing home insurance only, home care insurance only, or nursing home and home care insurance, taken by an agent shall include, or have attached thereto, a statement signed by the agent as follows: \"I have reviewed the current accident and health insurance coverage of the applicant and find that the indicated replacement, or the additional coverage of the type and amount applied for, is appropriate for the applicant's needs.\"\n(c) Upon determining that a sale will involve replacement, an insurer, other than a direct response insurer, or its agent, shall furnish the applicant, prior to issuance or delivery of the long term care insurance, nursing home insurance only, home care insurance only, or nursing home and home care insurance policy, a notice regarding replacement of accident and health insurance coverage. One copy of such notice shall be provided to the applicant and an additional copy signed by the applicant shall be retained by the insurer. A direct response insurer shall deliver to the applicant at the time of the issuance of the policy the notice regarding replacement of accident and health insurance coverage. (d) The notice required by subdivision (c) of this section for an insurer, other than a direct response insurer, shall be provided in substantially the following form: NOTICE TO APPLICANT REGARDING REPLACEMENT OF ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE\nAND THE PURCHASE OF MULTIPLE ACCIDENT AND HEALTH POLICIES\nAccording to (your application) (information you have furnished), you intend to lapse or otherwise terminate existing accident and health insurance and replace it with a policy to be issued by (Company Name) Insurance Company. Your new policy provides (insert appropriate number) days within which you may decide without cost whether you desire to keep the policy. For your own information and protection, you should be aware of and seriously consider certain factors which may affect the insurance protection available to you under the new policy. 1. Health conditions which you may presently have may be considered preexisting conditions and may not be immediately or fully covered under the new policy. This could result in denial or delay of a claim for benefits under the new policy, whereas a similar claim might have been payable under your present policy (this paragraph may be modified if preexisting conditions are covered under the new policy). 2. You should be aware that the premium rate for the replacement policy may be higher than what you are paying for the existing policy that you plan to replace. If the premium for your existing policy is based on your age when it was issued, you have built up equity in that policy which may be lost if you terminate it. 3. You may wish to secure the advice of your present insurer or its agent regarding the proposed replacement of your present policy. This is not only your right, but it is also in your best interest to make sure you understand all the relevant factors involved in replacing your present coverage. 4. If, after due consideration, you still wish to terminate your present policy and replace it with new coverage, be certain to truthfully and completely answer all questions on the application concerning your medical/health history. Failure to include all material medical information requested on an application may provide a basis for the company to deny any future claims and to refund your premium as though your policy had never been in force. After the application has been completed and before you sign it, reread it carefully to be certain that all information has been properly recorded. The above \"Notice to Applicant\" was delivered to me on: __________\n(Date)\n__________\n(Applicant's Signature)\nI have reviewed the current health insurance coverage of the applicant and find that replacement and/or additional coverage of the type and amount applied for is appropriate for the applicant's needs. __________\n(Agent's Signature)\n(e) The notice required by subdivision (c) of this section for a direct response insurer shall be as follows: NOTICE TO APPLICANT REGARDING REPLACEMENT OF ACCIDENT AND HEALTH INSURANCE\nAccording to (your application) (information you have furnished) you intend to lapse or otherwise terminate existing accident and health insurance and replace it with the policy delivered herewith issued by (Company Name)\n\nInsurance Company. Your new policy provides thirty (30) days within which you may decide without cost whether you desire to keep the policy. For your own information and protection, you should be aware of and seriously consider certain factors which may affect the insurance protection available to you under the new policy. 1. Health conditions which you may presently have may be considered preexisting conditions and may not be immediately or fully covered under the new policy. This could result in denial or delay of a claim for benefits under the new policy, whereas a similar claim might have been payable under your present policy (this paragraph may be modified if preexisting conditions are covered under the new policy). 2. You should be aware that the premium rate for the replacement policy may be higher than what you are paying for the existing policy that you plan to replace. If the premium for your existing policy is based on your age when it was issued, you have built up equity in that policy which may be lost if you terminate it. 3. You may wish to secure the advice of your present insurer or its agent regarding the proposed replacement of your present policy. This is not only your right, but it is also in your best interest to make sure you understand all the relevant factors involved in replacing your present coverage. 4. (To be included only if the application is attached to the policy.)\n\nIf, after due consideration, you still wish to terminate your present policy and replace it with new coverage, read the copy of the application attached to your new policy and be sure that all questions are answered fully and correctly. Omissions or misstatements in the application could cause an otherwise valid claim to be denied. Carefully check the application and write to (Company\n\nName and Address) within ten (10) days if any information is not correct and complete. __________\n(Company Name)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp.
