  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-3.6 - Journal voucher\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll postings to the general ledger other than those\nmade from the books of original entry shall originate from journal vouchers. Postings may be made directly from the journal vouchers, the bound vouchers\nthen serving in lieu of a journal voucher register, or, alternatively, a bound\njournal voucher register may be maintained as the posting medium. Typical\ntransactions requiring the use of journal vouchers include accruals of\nexpenses, write-offs of deferred charges to cost or expense, adjustments of\ninventories, distribution of payroll expense, establishment of reserves, authorization for the issuance of evidences of indebtedness, awards of\ncontracts, and similar entries which do not originate from one of the books of\noriginal entry. Journal vouchers shall not be used as a medium of entry for the\ntransfer of cash, the accounts payable voucher having been provided for such\npurpose. Journal vouchers shall be prepared in an original only. The former\nrequirement for transmittal of a duplicate copy to the division has been\neliminated. All journal vouchers shall be approved by a responsible official of\nthe local agency other than the person preparing the voucher. The official\ndesignated to approve journal vouchers should be a check signer. Each journal\nvoucher shall contain a full and complete explanation of the transaction to be\nrecorded. Reference should be made in the explanation to schedules, correspondence, or other evidence supporting the entry. If the entry results\nfrom formal action taken by the members of the local agency, specific reference\nto the minutes or resolutions, including the dates thereof, shall be included. Journal vouchers recording contract awards shall include reference to the date\nof communication from the division approving the contract. Journal vouchers\nshall indicate the amount or amounts to be charged and credited, and the\naccounts, including both general ledger and subsidiary ledger accounts, to be\nso charged and credited. Journal vouchers shall be numbered consecutively, a\nseparate series of journal vouchers being maintained for each general ledger. A\nspecimen journal voucher form is shown as Exhibit 11 of Appendix S-8. These\nforms are supplied by the local agency and should be printed. The forms should\nnot, however, be prenumbered. A standard stock form which provides the required\ninformation may be used. The use of a colored paper stock to distinguish\njournal vouchers from accounts payable vouchers is recommended. The specimen\nform exhibited can be adapted for use for a multiple development project where\nseparate accountability is prescribed or desired, by substituting for the\nproject name and number in the heading, a column for entering the project\nnumbers of the various sites. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-3.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
