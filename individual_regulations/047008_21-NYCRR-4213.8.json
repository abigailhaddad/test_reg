  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 4213.8 - Application and review\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All persons\nupon request therefor shall receive an information package including a copy of\nan informational bulletin describing the program and the forms of program\nassistance available. (b) To apply\nfor assistance from the loan fund, a potential applicant should request an\napplication from: Director, Minority and Women Business Development and\n\nRevolving Loan Fund, New York State Urban Development Corporation, 1515\n\nBroadway, New York, NY 10036-8960, (212) 930-0209. The potential applicant will\nthen be sent a formal application. Program applications require that the\nfollowing information, as applicable to a particular project, be submitted: (1)\ninformation about the company, including\nits history, ownership, size, primary products or services rendered, major\ncustomers, and major assets; (2)\ninformation about the proposed project, including a proposed budget setting\nforth total project cost, total assistance requested, proposed uses of the loan\nfunds and other proposed sources of funding; the number of jobs to be created\nor retained; and the current status of the project; (3)\na description of the need for the\nrequested funds, a specific justification of the loan request, a description of\nthe expected impact of the requested program assistance on the company and the\ncommunity, and an indication of the reason for seeking State\nassistance; (4)\ninformation about\nthe applicant's previous business activities; (5)\ninformation with respect to the site of\nthe project and the impact, if any, on the environment and any landmark or\nhistoric properties; (6)\ncopies of\nthe schematic architectural drawings, scope of work descriptions, site\ninvestigation reports and construction cost estimates; (7)\nresumes of principal officers, a list of\nowners, shareholders or partners; (8)\na complete set of financial statements\nfor at least the three preceding fiscal years; (9)\na business plan, including a market\nanalysis, description of marketing strategy and operating pro forma financial\nstatements going forward five years, including underlying assumptions based on\nthe business plan, income statements, balance sheets and cash flow\nstatements; (10)\na list of proposed\ncollateral, with appraisals or other documentation of the value of the proposed\ncollateral; (11)\nletters of\ncommitment from other financing sources involved in the project; (12)\na copy of the executed or proposed\npurchase option or contract for sale; (13)\na legal description and survey of the\nproperty; (14)\na\nconstruction-to-occupancy schedule; and\n(15)\nsuch additional information as the\ncorporation may determine to be necessary for a complete funding analysis to be\nmade. (c) The program\napplication is divided into two sections. Section I requests basic information, from the categories of information set forth in subdivision (b) of this\nsection, regarding the applicant and the proposed project which will enable\ncorporation staff to determine the eligibility of the applicant and the\nproposed project for program funding, to make a preliminary determination of\nthe feasibility of the proposed project and the creditworthiness of the\napplicant and to determine whether technical assistance in the structuring of\nthe transaction may be necessary or desirable. Section II requests more\ndetailed information which will permit corporation staff to perform a full\ncredit analysis and to determine the proposed project's compliance with program\nrequirements and its feasibility, so as to formulate a funding\nrecommendation. (d) Program\napplicants have the option of completing both sections of the program\napplication and submitting them simultaneously to the corporation for a full\nreview. Alternatively, program applicants may complete Section I and obtain a\npreliminary determination by the corporation regarding eligibility and\nfeasibility. (e) If an applicant\nopts to submit Section I for preliminary analysis, the corporation will review\nthe information for completeness, eligibility, preliminary feasibility and the\nneed for technical assistance. If staff determine that the project appears to\nbe eligible for funding, and that funding for such project appears to be\nfeasible, the applicant will receive a written invitation to submit Section II\nof the application. If staff determine that the project is either ineligible, not developed fully enough to merit funding consideration at that time or that\nit would be unfeasible to fund such project, the applicant will receive a\nletter advising him or her of other available sources of funding, or\nrecommending technical assistance which, in many cases, is available through\nthe corporation and other State-funded organizations. Projects referred for\ntechnical assistance may be eligible for consideration for program assistance\nagain once the technical assistance is obtained. (f) Each applicant will receive written\nacknowledgment by the corporation of its receipt, within 20 days thereof, of\neither Section II from an applicant that has received a preliminary\ndetermination of eligibility and feasibility or of Sections I and II from an\napplicant opting to submit them simultaneously. The acknowledgment will comment\nspecifically on the completeness of the information submitted. Applicants that\nhave not supplied all of the required information will be notified of what is\nmissing and asked to provide it. (g) Upon receipt of a complete Section II, or combined Section I and II, as the\ncase may be, a project team will be assigned to review the project. The\napplicant will be informed that the application is under consideration and that\na decision will be made, generally within 45 days, as to whether, and if so, in\nwhat amount the application will be presented for approval by the\ncorporation. (h) If a proposal is\ndetermined to be appropriate for funding under the criteria set forth in this\n\nPart, it will be presented to the corporation's directors for approval. The\ndirectors generally meet once a month. Loans in an amount of less than $100,000\nmay be authorized by the president and chief executive officer of the\ncorporation, acting on behalf of the corporation, subject to such\nauthorization's being ratified by the directors of the corporation prior to\nsubmission of the prospective financing to the State Public Authorities Control\n\nBoard (\"PACB\") for approval, if necessary. In the event a project is approved\nor ratified by the directors, in the manner required for the particular\nproject, it will, if necessary, then be reviewed by the PACB, which also\ngenerally meets once a month. (i) Upon the completion of the approval process, the corporation will issue, by\nletter, a commitment of limited time duration for approved program assistance. The commitment letter will set forth the terms and conditions for the\nauthorized assistance and will specify the date by which such assistance must\nbe closed or the commitment therefor will expire. At the discretion of the\ncorporation, the commitment expiration date may be extended. Projects for which\na commitment expiration date may be extended shall include, but not be limited\nto: (1)\nprojects which experience a delay in\nobtaining financing or equipment required to be obtained prior to the making of\nthe proposed program loan; (2)\nprojects which experience a delay in construction and/or renovation required to\nbe completed prior to the making of the proposed program loan; and\n(3)\nin the case of proposed government\ncontractor loans and government-sponsored residential construction loans, projects in which the eligible enterprise experiences a delay in the\ncommencement of its work pursuant to the government contract. (j) Notwithstanding the foregoing, all applications for program assistance will be reviewed, upon submission, to\nidentify manufacturing and industrial firms that may be eligible for industrial\ntechnology extension service (\"ITES\") assistance. Upon determination that an\napplicant may be eligible for participation in the ITES, the application will\nbe forwarded to the director of the ITES with a request that the firm's\neligibility be evaluated by ITES and, if determined to be eligible, that\ninformational materials be sent directly to the prospective ITES\nparticipant.
