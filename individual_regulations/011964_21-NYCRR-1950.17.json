  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1950.17 - Cross-connection prevention program\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The water board policy is to protect the\npublic water supply against actual or potential cross-connections by isolating\nwithin the premises contamination that may occur because of some undiscovered, or unauthorized cross-connection of the premises. This policy incorporates the\nelimination of existing connections between drinking water systems and other\nsources of water that are not approved as safe and potable for human\nconsumption. The policy also encompasses the elimination of cross-connections\nbetween drinking water supply. The policy extends to the prevention of the\nmaking of cross-connections in the future. The policy encourages the exclusive\nuse of public sources of water supply. (b) Except when the water board determines\nthat no significant hazard is posed by the premises served, the water board\nshall take such actions as it deems necessary and appropriate to protect the\npublic water system from existing or potential contamination by containing\nwithin or limiting the existing or potential contamination to the premises or\nthe user including, but not limited to: (1)\nby requiring an acceptable air gap, reduced pressure zone device, double-check\nvalve assembly or equivalent protective device acceptable to the director\nconsistent with the degree of hazard posed by the premises served by the\nconnection; (2)\nby requiring the\nusers of such connections to submit plans for the installation of protective\ndevices, to the supplier of water and the State for approval. Such submission\nshall be accompanied with as plan review fee as identified in the board\nschedule of rates; and\n(3)\nby\nassuring that all protective devices be inspected and tested at least annually\nby the user. The records of such inspections and tests shall be made available\nto and maintained by the water board. (c) The water board shall not allow a user to\nestablish a separate source of water. However, if the user justifies the need\nfor a separate source of water, the water board shall take such action as it\ndeems necessary and appropriate to protect the public water system from a user\nwho has a separate source of water and does not pose a hazard as provided in\nthis subdivision, including, but not limited to: (1)\nby requiring the user to regularly\nexamine the separate water source as to its quality; (2)\nby reviewing and approving the use of\nonly those separate water sources which are properly developed, constructed, protected, and found to meet the requirements of the State Health Code. Applicants shall submit plans for construction thereof to the director together\nwith a plan review fee as identified in the board schedule of rates; and\n(3)\nby filing such approvals\nwith the water board annually. (d) All users of public water system shall\nprevent cross-connections between the potable water piping system and any other\npiping system within the premises. (e) The user on any premises where backflow\nprotective devices are installed shall conduct competent inspections at least\nonce a year, or more often in those instances where successive inspections\nindicate repeated failure, and the director has established a more frequent\nschedule. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the\nexpense of the user whenever they are found to be defective. These tests shall\nbe performed in the presence of a certified backflow prevention device tester, and all test results shall be forwarded within 25 days to the director and the\n\nNiagara County Health Department. In the event that the test report is not\nreceived by the director within 25 days of the appropriate schedule, an order\nto comply will be issued. The city or water board will make its certified\nbackflow prevention device tester available for inspections and testing on\nschedules established by the city in conjunction with the water board, and at\nthe expense of the user. The director shall have access to any test being\nconducted. (f) Inspection requests\nshall be as follows: (1)\n\nUpon request of any\nproperty owner or his or her agent, the cross-connection inspector shall make\nan inspection of water connections to determine compliance or non-compliance\nwith this Part and the State Plumbing Code. A property owner or his agent shall\nsubmit with any inspection request an inspection fee as identified in the board\nschedule of rates to cover the cost of such inspections; provided, however, that if the inspection fee has been paid and an inspection reveals any\nnon-compliance with this Part or the State Plumbing Code, a request for\nre-inspection made within 120 days of the last inspection maybe made and will\nbe provided without payment of any additional fee. (2)\n\nUpon completion of any inspection or\nre-inspection, the cross-connection inspector shall issue or cause to be issued\na letter stating compliance or non-compliance with this Part and the State\n\nPlumbing Code.
