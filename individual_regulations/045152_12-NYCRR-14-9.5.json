  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.5 - Power actuated pressure relieving devices\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor a forced-flow steam generator with no fixed steam\nand waterline, equipped with automatic controls and protective interlocks\nresponsive to steam pressure, safety valves may be provided in accordance with\nsection\n14-9.9\nof this Subpart or the\nfollowing protection against over-pressure shall be provided: (a) One or more power-actuated pressure\nrelieving valves [FN3] shall be provided in direct communication with the\nboiler when the boiler is under pressure and shall receive a control impulse to\nopen when the maximum allowable working pressure at the superheater outlet, as\nshown in the master stamping, is exceeded. The total combined relieving\ncapacity of the power-actuated relieving valves shall be not less than 10\npercent of the maximum design steaming capacity of the boiler under any\noperating condition as determined by the manufacturer. The valve or valves\nshall be located in the pressure part system where they will relieve the\noverpressure. An isolating stop valve of the outside-screw-and-yoke type may be\ninstalled between the power-actuated pressure relieving valve and the boiler to\npermit repairs provided an alternate power-actuated pressure relieving valve of\nthe same capacity is so installed as to be in direct communication with the\nboiler in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph. Power-actuated\npressure relieving valves discharging to intermediate pressure and incorporated\ninto bypass and/or startup circuits by the boiler manufacturer need not be\ncapacity certified. Instead, they shall be marked by the valve manufacturer\nwith a capacity rating at a set of specified inlet pressure and temperature\nconditions. Power-actuated pressure relieving valves discharging directly to\natmosphere shall be capacity certified and ASME Code stamped. (b) Spring-loaded safety valves shall be\nprovided, having a total combined relieving capacity, including that of the\npower-actuated pressure relieving capacity installed under subdivision (a) of\nthis section, of not less than 100 percent of the maximum designed steaming\ncapacity of the boiler, as determined by the manufacturer, except when the\nalternate provisions of subdivision (c) of this section are satisfied. In this\ntotal, no credit in excess of 30 percent of the total required relieving\ncapacity shall be allowed for the power-actuated pressure relieving valves\nactually installed. Any or all of the spring-loaded safety valves may be set\nabove the maximum allowable working pressure of the parts to which they are\nconnected, but the set pressures shall be such that when all of these valves\n(together with the power-actuated pressure relieving valves) are in operation\nthe pressure will not rise more than 20 percent above the maximum allowable\nworking pressure of any part of the boiler, except for the steam piping between\nthe boiler and the prime mover. (c) The total installed capacity of spring-loaded safety valves may be less than\nthe requirements of subdivision (b) of this section provided all of the\nfollowing conditions are met: (1)\n\nThe boiler\nshall be of no less steaming capacity than 1,000,000 lb/hr and installed in a\nunit system for power generation (i.e., a single boiler supplying a single\nturbine-generator unit). (2)\n\nThe\nboiler shall be provided with automatic devices, responsive to variations in\nsteam pressure, which include no less than all the following: (i) a control capable of maintaining steam\npressure at the desired operating level and of modulating tiring rates and\nfeedwater flow--in proportion to a variable steam output; and\n(ii)\na control which overrides subparagraph\n(i) of this paragraph by reducing the fuel rate and feedwater flow when the\nsteam pressure exceeds the maximum allowable working pressure by 10 percent; and\n(iii)\na direct-acting\noverpressure-trip-actuating mechanism, using an independent pressure sensing\ndevice, that will stop the flow of fuel and feedwater to the boiler, at a\npressure higher than the set pressure of subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, but less than 20 percent above the maximum allowable working\npressure. (3)\n\nThere\nshall be not less than two spring-loaded safety valves and the total rated\nrelieving capacity of the spring-loaded safety valves shall be not less than 10\npercent of the maximum designed steaming capacity of the boiler as determined\nby the manufacturer. These spring-loaded safety valves may be set above the\nmaximum allowable working pressure of the parts to which they are connected but\nshall be set such that the valves will lift at a pressure no higher than 20\npercent above the maximum allowable working pressure. (4)\n\nAt least two of these spring-loaded\nsafety valves shall be equipped with a device that directly transmits the valve\nstem lift action to controls that will stop the flow of fuel and feedwater to\nthe boiler The control circuitry to accomplish this shall be arranged in a\n\"fail-safe\" manner (see Note). Note:\"Fail-safe\" shall mean a circuitry arranged as\neither of the following: Note: (1)\n\nEnergize to trip: There shall be at least two separate and independent trip\ncircuits served by two power sources, to initiate and perform the trip action. One power source shall be a continuously charged DC battery. The second source\nshall be an AC-to-DC converter connected to the DC system to charge the battery\nand capable of performing the trip action. The trip circuits shall be\ncontinuously monitored for availability. It is not mandatory to duplicate the\nmechanism that actually stops the flow of fuel and feedwater. Note: (2)\n\nDe-energize to trip: If the circuits are\narranged in such a way that a continuous supply of power is required to keep\nthe circuits closed and operating and such that any interruption of power\nsupply will actuate the trip mechanism, then a single trip circuit and single\npower supply will be enough to meet the requirements of this\nsubparagraph. (5)\n\nThe\npower supply for all controls and devices required by this subdivision shall\ninclude at least one source contained within the same plant as the boiler and\nwhich is arranged to actuate the controls and devices continuously in the event\nof failure or interruption of any other power sources. (d) When stop valves are installed in the\nwater-steam flow path between any two sections of a forced-flow steam generator\nwith no fixed steam and waterline: (1)\nthe\npower-actuated pressure relieving valve(s) required by subdivision (a) of this\nsection shall also receive a control impulse to open when the maximum allowable\nworking pressure of the component, having the lowest pressure level upstream to\nthe stop valve, is exceeded; and\n(2)\nthe spring-loaded safety valves shall be\nlocated to provide the pressure protection requirements in subdivision (b) or\n(c) of this section. (e) A reliable pressure-recording device shall always be in service and records\nkept to provide evidence of conformity to the above requirements. [FN3] The power-actuated pressure relieving valve is\none whose movements to open or close are fully controlled by a source of power\n(electricity, air, steam, or hydraulic). The valve may discharge to atmosphere\nor to a container at lower pressure. The discharge capacity may be affected by\nthe downstream conditions, and such effects shall be taken into account. If the\npower-actuated pressure relieving valves are also positioned in response to\nother control signals, the control impulse to prevent overpressure shall be\nresponsive only to pressure and shall override any other control\nfunction.
