  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-3.2 - Determination of eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In\ndetermining the eligibility of expenditures, both the purpose for which the\nexpenditure was made and the amount of the expenditure and the manner in which\nit was made, are examined. An expenditure may, thus, be declared ineligible\neven if it is for an authorized or approved purpose, if it is in excess of an\napproved amount, or has been made without the required approvals or\nauthorizations on the part of either the local agency, or the division, or\nboth. In certain cases, expenditures to be eligible, require the specific\napproval or authorization of the division, in others, the priorapproval or\nauthorization of the division is required, and, in some cases, the approval or\nprior approval or authorization of the division of the commitment for the\nexpenditure is required as well. The division's requirements with respect to\napprovals are contained in the manuals of procedure[FN*]. (b) The more important standards used to test\nthe eligibility of expenditures are here summarized for the information and\nguidance of local agencies. Details will be found, by subject, in other\nsections of this Subchapter. (1)\n\nDirect\nconnection. Expenditures may be declared ineligible because they are not an\nessential cost or expense directly connected with the development or operation\nof a specific project under the terms of the contract for State aid for that\nproject. (2)\n\nStatutory provisions. Expenditures may be declared ineligible because of the operation of specific\nprovisions of the Public Housing Law. The more important of these provisions\nrelate to the compensation of members of a local housing authority, administrative expenses of an authority, and tax exemptions. Applicable\nprovisions of other statutes, such as the exemption from Federal income and\nexcise taxes granted by the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, may also operate to\nrender expenditures ineligible. (3)\n\nMingling of funds. Expenditures may be declared ineligible because they\nconstitute a mingling of funds, as defined in Subpart 1640-2, supra. (4)\n\nRules and regulations. Expenditures may\nbe declared ineligible for failure to comply with the rules and regulations of\nthe division and various instructions and directives issued by the division, and having the effect of rules and regulations. Such rules, regulations, instructions and directives may specify the purpose for which the expenditure\nis made, limit the amount which may be expended, and prescribe the manner in\nwhich the expenditure may be made. The latter refers to procedures in\nconnection with the letting of contracts, requirements for approval or prior\napproval, etc. In some cases, notably in connection with land acquisition, the\nrequirements for approval reach beyond the expenditure itself to require prior\napproval or authorization by the division of the commitment for the\nexpenditure. (5)\n\nContract for State\naid. Expenditures may be declared ineligible for failure to comply with the\nterms of the contract for State aid. The contract for State aid incorporates, by reference, the application for financial assistance, and expenditures, to be\neligible, must also comply with the terms of the application. In a contract for\nthe advance of loan funds by the State, it is evident that the maximum amount\nof the loan operates as a limit on the total amount of eligible expenditures\npossible. (6)\n\nBudgetary and\nextra-budgetary limitations. Expenditures in excess of amounts budgeted for the\nvarious eligible purposes may be declared ineligible. Expenditures for\ndevelopment purposes are controlled by a development cost budget which forms\npart of the application for financial assistance. Expenditures during the\noperating period, are, similarly, controlled by an operating budget submitted\nannually. Overruns of the amounts budgeted for the various eligible purposes\nmay, however, be authorized by the division under certain conditions. The\namount of the overrun which may be authorized for a particular item is limited\nby regulation of the division and there are some budget items for which no\noverruns will be authorized because of extra-budgetary limitations reflected in\nthe contract for State aid, in the application for financial assistance, in\ninstructions and directives of the division, in rulings of the commissioner, or\nin supplementary agreements between the division and the local agency. Land\nacquisition costs are a common example of the application of extra-budgetary\nlimitations. (7)\n\nInternal approvals\nand authorizations. Expenditures may be declared ineligible for failure to\ncomply with the requirements for internal approval and authorization by the\nlocal agency. Certain requirements for internal approval and authorization may\nbe set up by the division, as in the case of the requirement that all\nexpenditures shall be properly vouchered; other requirements may be set up on\nthe initiative of the local agency. A great deal, of course, depends on the\nsize and organization of the local agency. Some expenditures may require only\nthe approval of appropriate officers or employees of the local agency; others\nmay require appropriate resolution of the governing and policy-making body of\nthe local agency; still others may require authorization, by the appropriate\nbody of the local agency, of the commitment to make the expenditures, as\nwell. (8)\n\nExamples of ineligible\nexpenditures. Exhibit 9 of Appendix S-6 lists typical ineligible expenditures\nwhich will not be allowed as project costs or expenses. Revisions will be made\nfrom time to time, as the need may arise. [FN*] See Subchapter C of this\n\nChapter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
