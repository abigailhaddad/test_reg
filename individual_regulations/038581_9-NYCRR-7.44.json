Tit. 9 § 7.44 - Executive order no. 44: directing the reallocation of deemed waived recovery zone facility bond allocations\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the Federal government enacted the American\n\nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (\"ARRA\") in order to stimulate the\nnational economy and increase employment; and\nWHEREAS, the ARRA created the Recovery Zone Facility Bond\n(\"RZFB\") program in order to support private business development projects and\ntrade activity in designated economically distressed areas termed \"Recovery\n\nZones\"; and\nWHEREAS, pursuant to the ARRA and as described in Notice\n2009-50 of the Internal Revenue Service (Notice 2009-50), the State of New York\n(\"State\") received an allocation of RZFB Volume Cap of $555,147,000; Notice\n2009-50 further required that such allocation be initially allocated among\ncounties and certain large municipalities (\"Original Allocation Recipients\") in\nthe amounts as provided therein (\"Original Allocations\"); and\nWHEREAS, to advance the State's economic development\nefforts, Empire State Development Corporation (\"ESDC\") and the Department of\n\nEconomic Development (\"DED\") distributed a memorandum on December 29, 2009\nrequesting information from Original Allocation Recipients about their issuance\nplans for RZFBs and use of the Original Allocations and requested the delivery\nof express and affirmative waivers to ESDC of all or part of their Original\n\nAllocations in the event such allocations would not be used, attaching a form\nto be used for such purpose; and\nWHEREAS, under ARRA, RZFB's must be issued before January\n1, 2011 (the \"Expiration Date\"); and\nWHEREAS, the State, through the efforts of ESDC and DED, has provided extensive guidance about RZFBs to Original Allocation Recipients, including outreach and assistance to elected officials and economic developers\nrelated to projects and reallocation requests; and\nWHEREAS, in November 2010, the Chair of the New York State\n\nEconomic Recovery and Reinvestment Cabinet, which I created to manage the\ndevelopment of State and local infrastructure projects financed through ARRA, issued a request for RZFB waivers, which noted FSDC's authorization to act for\n\nState regarding RZFB guidance and included the waiver form previously\ndistributed by ESDC; and\nWHEREAS, it is critical that the State and its localities\ntake advantage of the RZFB program to create jobs, foster economic development, and develop critical infrastructure, and therefore, to the extent any Original\n\nAllocations will not be used by the Original Allocation Recipients, it is\nimperative to provide for the re-allocation of such unused allocations to\nprojects that would promote economic recovery of the State prior to the\n\nExpiration Date; and\nWHEREAS, there is no reasonable basis to assume that such\n\nExpiration Date will be extended by the Federal government; and\nWHEREAS, the ARRA and Notice 2009-50 provide that all or\nany portion of the Original Allocations may be waive or deemed waived by the\n\nOriginal Allocation Recipients and upon such waiver, a state shall be\nauthorized to re-allocate the waived allocation in any reasonable manner as it\nshall determine in good faith in its discretion; NOW, THEREFORE, I, David A.
