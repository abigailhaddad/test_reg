  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 528.14 - Tangible personal property sold through coin operated vending machines\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1115(a)(13), (13-a)\n(a) Tangible personal property sold\nthrough coin operated vending machines at 10 cents or less. Exemption-Tangible personal property sold through coin\noperated vending machines at 10 cents or less is exempt from the sales and use\ntax when the vending machine operator: (1)\nis primarily engaged in making sales of\ntangible personal property through vending machines at 10 cents or less; and\n(2)\nmaintains records\nsatisfactory to the Department of Taxation and Finance. (See section\n533.2\nof this\n\nTitle.)\n\nCross reference: See section\n527.8\n(g)-(h)\nof this Title for sales of food through coin operated vending machines at 10\ncents or less. (b) Tangible personal property sold\nthrough coin operated bulk vending machines at 25 cents or less. (1)\n\nExemption. Tangible personal property sold through coin operated bulk\nvending machines at 25 cents or less is exempt from the sales and use tax when\nthe vending machine operator: (i) is\nprimarily engaged in making sales of tangible personal property through bulk\nvending machines at 25 cents or less; and\n(ii)\nmaintains records satisfactory to the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. (See section\n533.2\nof this\n\nTitle.) Food or drink sold through a coin operated bulk vending machine at 25\ncents or less is exempt only when the bulk vending machine is located on\npremises which have no facilities provided for customers for on premises\nconsumption. (2)\n\nBulk\nvending machine. As used in this section, bulk vending machine\nmeans a vending machine, containing unsorted merchandise, which, upon insertion\nof a coin, dispenses such merchandise in approximately equal portions, at\nrandom and without selection by the customer. Gumballs, candy and various toys\nor trinkets in plastic capsules are typical of the merchandise typically\ndispensed in bulk vending machines. (c) Primarily. The term\nprimarily, as used in this\nsection, means 50 percent or more. (1)\n\nFor purposes of subdivision (a) of this section, 50 percent or more of the\nvending machine operator's total receipts from all sources must be derived from\nsales of tangible property sold through vending machines at 10 cents or less. Example 1: A vending machine operator's schedule of receipts\nshows: Price\n\nItems sold\n\nReceipts\n10¢\n1,000\n$100. 50¢\n200\n100. $200. As the receipts from sales of items priced at 10 cents are\n50 percent or more of the total receipts, such sales are not subject to tax. The receipts from the sales of items at 50 cents are taxable. Example 2: A vending machine operator's schedule of receipts\nshows: Price\n\nItems sold\n\nReceipts\n10¢\n400\n$40. 50¢\n100\n50. $90. Although the number of items sold at 10 cents is 50 percent\nor more of the total number of items sold, the receipts from such sales are\nless than 50 percent of the total receipts. Therefore, total receipts, including those sold at 10 cents are subject to tax. Example 3: A supermarket has vending machines which dispense candy and\ntrinkets for 10 cents. The receipts in a given period from the machines are\n$200 and the receipts from the remainder of the business are $5,000. The\nsupermarket is not primarily engaged in making sales at 10 cents or less\nthrough coin operated vending machines and the receipts therefrom must be\nincluded in the supermarket's taxable receipts when computing the tax\ndue. (2)\n\nFor purposes of\nsubdivision (b) of this section, 50 percent or more of the bulk vending machine\noperator's total receipts from all sources must be derived from sales of\ntangible personal property sold through coin operated bulk vending machines at\n25 cents or less. Example 1: A bulk vending machine operator's schedule of receipts\nshows: Price\n\nItems sold\n\nReceipts\n25¢\n1,000\n$250. 50¢\n200\n100. $350. As the receipts from sales of items priced at 25 cents are\n50 percent or more of the total receipts, such sales are not subject to tax. The receipts from the sales of items at 50 cents are taxable. Example 2: A bulk vending machine operator's schedule of receipts\nshows: Price\n\nItems sold\n\nReceipts\n25¢\n1,000\n$250. 50¢\n800\n400. $650. Although the number of items sold at 25 cents is 50 percent\nor more of the total number of items sold, the receipts from such sales are\nless than 50 percent of the total receipts. Therefore, total receipts, including those sold at 25 cents are subject to tax. Example 3: A supermarket has bulk vending machines which dispense\ncandy and trinkets for 25 cents or less. The receipts in a given period from\nthe machines are $200 and the receipts from the remainder of the business are\n$5,000. The supermarket is not primarily engaged in making sales at 25 cents or\nless through coin operated bulk vending machines and the receipts therefrom\nmust be included in the supermaket's taxable receipts when computing the tax\ndue. (d) Taxable sales. (1)\n\nSales through coin\noperated vending machines (which are not bulk vending machines) subject to the\nsales and use tax are: (i) tangible personal\nproperty sold at an amount in excess of 10 cents; Example 1: The sale of a photocopy at 15 cents through a coin operated\nmachine is a taxable sale of tangible personal property. (ii)\ntangible personal property sold at 10\ncents or less when the vending machine operator is not primarily engaged in\nmaking such sales (see Example 3 of paragraph [b][1] of this\nsection); (iii)\nservices to\ntangible personal property; Example 2: Laminating services provided by coin operated vending\nmachines are taxable. Example 3: The cleaning of a bowling ball by a coin operated vending\nmachine is taxable. (iv)\nfood and drink sold at an amount in excess of 10 cents. (See section\n527.8\n[g] and\n[h]\nof this Title for sales of food and drink\nat 10 cents or less.)\n(2)\n\nSales through coin operated bulk vending\nmachines subject to the sales and use tax are: (i) tangible personal property sold at an\namount in excess of 25 cents; (ii)\ntangible personal property sold at 25 cents or less when the vending machine\noperator is not primarily engaged in making such sales; (iii)\nservices to tangible personal\nproperty; (iv)\nfood and drink sold\nat 11 cents or more when the bulk vending machine is located on premises\nconsidered to be eating establishments selling food or drink for on premises\nconsumption; and\n(v) food and drink\nsold at an amount in excess of 25 cents. (e) (1)\n\nCollection of tax. Vending machine operators are required to collect the tax\nin accordance with the tax bracket schedules on sales of tangible personal\nproperty sold at an amount in excess of 10 cents and on taxable services to\ntangible personal property. Bulk vending machine operators are required to\ncollect the tax in accordance with the tax bracket schedules on sales of\ntangible personal property sold at an amount in excess of 25 cents. (See Part\n530 of this Title.)\n(2)\n\nWhen\nsales of tangible personal property are made through vending machines at 10\ncents or less, or through bulk vending machines at 25 cents or less, by a\nvending machine operator or bulk vending machine operator who is not primarily\nengaged in making such sales, the operator is liable for the payment of the tax\non his sales even though the tax is in an amount which cannot be collected from\nthe purchaser. (See section\n533.4\nof this Title for payment of tax.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n528.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
