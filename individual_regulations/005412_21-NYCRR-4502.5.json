Except when\nthe contract payment is of the type where the facts and conditions are as\ndefined pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, payments shall be made by\nthe payment due dates specified in accordance with the contract. (b) RIOC shall have 15 calendar days after\nreceipt of an invoice at the designated payment office to notify the contractor\nof: (1)\ndefects in the delivered goods, property or services; (2)\ndefects\nin the invoice; (3)\nsuspected\nimproprieties of any kind.

(c) RIOC\nmay justify extension of the contract payment date in order for RIOC not to\nbecome liable for interest payments in accordance with section\n4502.6\nof this Part. The bases for\nextension may include, but shall not be limited to, the following when: (1)\nin accordance with specific statutory or\ncontractual provisions, payment must be preceded by an inspection period or by\nan audit to determine the resources applied or used by a contractor in\nfulfilling the terms of the contract; (2)\nthe necessary State government\nappropriation required to authorize payment has yet to be enacted; (3)\na proper invoice must be examined by the\n\nFederal government prior to payment; and\n(4)\nsuch date by which contract payment must\nbe made is modified in accordance with this subdivision.
