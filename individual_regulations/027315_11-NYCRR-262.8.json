  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 262.8 - Policy limits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A policy providing legal services insurance may establish separate dollar limits for services provided under the coverage. (b) Legal services insurance that is written as part of a policy of liability insurance may not reduce the limits of liability under the liability insurance coverage except as permitted by the provisions of Part 71 of this Title (Regulation 107). (c) A policy providing legal services insurance may include a reasonable deductible for such services but when the coverage is written as part of a policy of liability insurance, the deductible shall be separate and apart from any deductible under any liability insurance policy of which it is part. To the extent that the legal services provided under the coverage relate to legal services for a claim under the liability coverage for which a deductible applies, then the services shall be applied to both deductibles.
