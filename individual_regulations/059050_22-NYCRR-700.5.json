Tit. 22 § 700.5 - Obligations of the judge\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In the administration of justice\nthe judge shall safeguard the rights of the parties and the interests of the\npublic. The judge at all times shall be dignified, courteous, and considerate\nof the parties, attorneys, jurors, and witnesses. In the performance of his\nduties, and in the maintenance of proper court decorum the judge is in all\nrespects bound by the canons of judicial ethics. (b) The judge shall use his\njudicial power to prevent disruptions of the trial. (c) A judge before whom a case\nis moved for trial shall preside at such trial unless he is satisfied, upon\nchallenge or sua sponte, that he is unable to serve with complete impartiality, in fact or appearance, with regard to the matter at issue or the parties\ninvolved. (d) Where\nthe judge deems it appropriate in order to preserve or enhance the dignity, order and decorum of the proceedings, he shall prescribe and make known the\nrules relating to conduct which the parties, attorneys, witnesses and others\nwill be expected to follow in the courtroom. (e) The judge should be the exemplar of\ndignity and impartiality. He shall suppress his personal predilections, control\nhis temper and emotions, and otherwise avoid conduct on his part which tends to\ndemean the proceedings or to undermine his authority in the courtroom. When it\nbecomes necessary during trial for him to comment upon the conduct of\nwitnesses, spectators, counsel, or others, or upon the testimony, he shall do\nso in a firm and polite manner, limiting his comments and rulings to what is\nreasonably required for the orderly progress of the trial, and refraining from\nunnecessary disparagement of persons or issues. (f) The judge is not relieved\nof these obligations by what he may regard as a deficiency in the conduct of\nany attorney who appears before him; nor is he relieved of these obligations by\nwhat he believes to be the moral, political, social, or ideological\ndeficiencies of the cause of any party.
