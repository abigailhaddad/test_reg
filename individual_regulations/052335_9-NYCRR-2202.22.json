(b) Where: (1)\nno registration statement has been filed\nunder the Federal Act, or the State Rent Act, or the City Rent Law, as required\nby these regulations; or\n(2)\nno\nproper or timely registration statement has been filed as required by these\nregulations; or\n(3)\nno statement\nhas been filed as required by section\n2203.9\nof this Title; or\n(4)\nno proper or timely statement has been\nfiled as required by said section; or\n(5)\nthe administrator in a proceeding\npursuant to subdivision (a) of this section is unable to otherwise determine\nthe maximum rent; or\n(6)\nthe\nmaximum rent must be fixed or established by the administrator; he may issue an order fixing or establishing the maximum\nrent, having regard for the maximum rents for comparable housing accommodations\nor any other factors bearing on the equities involved, consistent with the\npurpose of the Rent Law, including but not limited to the factor that such\nhousing accommodations were created from housing accommodations which were\nvacated, on or after November 22, 1963, other than by voluntary surrender of\npossession or in the manner provided by Part 2204 of this Title.
