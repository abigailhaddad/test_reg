  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 352.5 - Energy assistance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Tenant and customer of record\nrequirements. Prior to granting energy assistance under subdivisions\n(b) through (g) of this section, it must be documented that the\napplicant/recipient/grantee is the tenant and customer of record. A\ntenant of record\nis a person who has primary responsibility\nfor payment of the monthly rent or mortgage for the dwelling unit. Individuals\nwho contribute a portion of the monthly rent/mortgage to a person responsible\nfor payment of the monthly rent/mortgage for the dwelling unit will not be\nconsidered a tenant of record. A\ncustomer of record\nis a\nperson who has an account in his or her name with a home energy vendor. An\nindividual who is not the tenant and customer of record is considered to meet\nthe tenant and customer of record requirement(s) when such individual is the\nspouse of the tenant and customer of record who is living in the same household\nor who is the surviving spouse of a deceased spouse who was the tenant and\ncustomer of record. The term\nhome energy vendor\nmeans an\nindividual or entity engaged in the business of selling electricity, natural\ngas, oil, propane, kerosene, coal, wood, or any other fuel used for residential\nheating and/or domestic (lights, cooking, hot water) energy. (b) Fuel for heating allowances. Each social services district must grant an allowance for\nfuel for heating to a public assistance applicant/recipient or self-maintaining\ngrantee in receipt of public assistance for a dependent child or children when\nit is documented that the applicant/recipient/grantee is the tenant of record, as defined in subdivision (a) of this section, with primary responsibility for\npayment of the residential heating costs. A fuel for heating allowance must\nalso be granted to a public assistance applicant/recipient/grantee whose\nutility heating bill may include costs for service for the\napplicant/recipient/grantee's own residential unit and for space outside that\nunit or whose non-utility heating bill includes costs for the\napplicant/recipient/grantee's own residential unit and for other residential\nunits when it is documented that the applicant/recipient/grantee is the tenant\nand customer of record as defined in subdivision (a) of this section. When a\nfuel for heating allowance is granted to an applicant/recipient/grantee who is\nthe customer of record for a utility bill which may include costs for service\nfor the applicant/recipient/grantee's own residential unit and for space\noutside that unit, the social services district must determine whether a\nreferral for a shared meter investigation, in accordance with the provisions of\nsection\n52\nof the\n\nPublic Service Law, is appropriate. To have primary responsibility for the\npayment of residential heating costs, the applicant/recipient/grantee must be\nthe customer of record, as defined in subdivision (a) of this section, for the\nresidential heating bill with a home energy vendor. Fuel for heating allowances\nmust be provided on a 12-month heating season (October 1st- September 30th) in\naccordance with the following schedules and must be based upon the\napplicant/recipient/grantee's primary residential heating source: SCHEDULE SA-6a MONTHLY ALLOWANCES FOR FUEL FOR\nHEATING BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 1987: Oil, Kerosene, Propane\n\nCounties of: Nassau, New York City, Suffolk, Westchester\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$70\n70\n70\n73\n77\n82\n88\n93\n\nCounties of: Chautauqua, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Ulster\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$68\n68\n68\n71\n74\n80\n85\n91\n\nCounties of: Columbia, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Onondaga, Ontario, Orleans, Oswego, Wayne\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$69\n69\n69\n72\n75\n81\n87\n92\n\nCounties of: Albany, Cayuga, Chemung, Greene, Schenectady, Schuyler, Seneca, Tompkins, Yates\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$69\n69\n69\n72\n75\n81\n87\n92\n\nCounties of: Allegany, Broome, Cattaraugus, Chenango, Cortland, Delaware, Fulton, Jefferson, Madison, Montgomery, Otsego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schoharie, Steuben, Sullivan, Tioga, Warren, Washington, Wyoming\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$72\n72\n72\n75\n78\n84\n90\n96\n\nCounties of: Clinton, Lewis, Oneida, St. Lawrence\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$71\n71\n71\n74\n78\n83\n89\n95\n\nCounties of: Essex, Franklin, Hamilton, Herkimer\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$77\n77\n77\n80\n84\n90\n96\n102\nSCHEDULE SA-6b MONTHLY ALLOWANCES FOR FUEL FOR\nHEATING BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 1987: Natural Gas, Coal, Wood, Municipal Electric\n\nUtilities not Regulated by the Public Service Commission, Any Other Fuel not\n\nCovered by SA-6a and SA-6c\n\nCounties of: Nassau, New York City, Suffolk, Westchester\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$56\n56\n56\n58\n61\n65\n69\n74\n\nCounties of: Chautauqua, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Ulster\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$55\n55\n55\n57\n60\n64\n68\n73\n\nCounties of: Columbia, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Onondaga, Ontario, Orleans, Oswego, Wayne\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$54\n54\n54\n56\n58\n63\n67\n71\n\nCounties of: Albany, Cayuga, Chemung, Greene, Schenectady, Schuyler, Seneca, Tompkins, Yates\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$58\n58\n58\n60\n63\n68\n72\n77\n\nCounties of: Allegany, Broome, Cattaraugus, Chenango, Cortland, Delaware, Fulton, Jefferson, Madison, Montgomery, Otsego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schoharie, Steuben, Sullivan, Tioga, Warren, Washington, Wyoming\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$58\n58\n58\n60\n63\n67\n72\n77\n\nCounties of: Clinton, Lewis, Oneida, St. Lawrence\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$55\n55\n55\n57\n60\n64\n69\n73\n\nCounties of: Essex, Franklin, Hamilton, Herkimer\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$66\n66\n66\n68\n71\n77\n82\n87\nSCHEDULE SA-6c MONTHLY ALLOWANCES FOR FUEL FOR\nHEATING BEGINNING OCTOBER 1, 1987: Public Service Commission\"\"Regulated Electric\n\nUtilities, Village of Greenport Electric\n\nCounties of: Nassau, New York City, Suffolk, Westchester\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$90\n90\n90\n94\n99\n106\n113\n120\n\nCounties of: Chautauqua, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Ulster\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$105\n105\n105\n109\n114\n123\n131\n139\n\nCounties of: Columbia, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Onondaga, Ontario, Orleans, Oswego, Wayne\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$107\n107\n107\n111\n117\n125\n134\n142\n\nCounties of: Albany, Cayuga, Chemung, Greene, Schenectady, Schuyler, Seneca, Tompkins, Yates\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$120\n120\n120\n125\n131\n140\n150\n160\n\nCounties of: Allegany, Broome, Cattaraugus, Chenango, Cortland, Delaware, Fulton, Jefferson, Madison, Montgomery, Otsego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schoharie, Steuben, Sullivan, Tioga, Warren, Washington, Wyoming\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$122\n122\n122\n127\n133\n142\n152\n162\n\nCounties of: Clinton, Lewis, Oneida, St. Lawrence\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$122\n122\n122\n127\n133\n143\n153\n163\n\nCounties of: Essex, Franklin, Hamilton, Herkimer\n\nNumber of persons\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8+\n12 month\n$140\n140\n140\n146\n153\n164\n175\n186\n(c) Payment essential to obtain\nnonutility heating fuel for an applicant for aid to dependent children, home\nrelief, veteran assistance or emergency public assistance. The district must authorize a nonrecoupable payment to an\napplicant for aid to dependent children, home relief, veteran assistance or\nemergency public assistance for nonutility (other than natural gas or\nelectricity) heating fuel, including an applicant whose nonutility heating bill\nincludes costs for the applicant's own residential unit and for other\nresidential units, provided such payment is necessary to obtain nonutility\nheating fuel essential for the applicant's residential heating purposes. Such\npayment may only be made when it is documented that the applicant is the tenant\nof record and the customer of record, as defined in subdivision (a) of this\nsection, and alternative payment or housing accommodations cannot be arranged\nand the applicant is without liquid resources to pay for such nonutility\nheating fuel. Such payment must not exceed the cost of nonutility heating fuel\nrequired to meet the applicant's immediate need. However, once an initial\npayment has been authorized for an applicant whose nonutility heating bill\nincludes costs for the applicant's own residential unit and for other\nresidential units, subsequent emergency payments to obtain nonutility heating\nfuel for that applicant may only be authorized for deliveries made on an\nalternate basis with the other unit(s) sharing the fuel source. Prior to\nissuing payment for each subsequent delivery, it must be documented that\nheating fuel in amounts reasonably comparable to the most recent delivery paid\nfor by the social services district has been provided by or on behalf of the\nother unit(s) sharing the fuel source. When the alternate delivery requirement\nhas not been met or cannot be documented, the social services district must\naddress the applicant's heating emergency with alternative methods. These\nmethods include, but are not limited to, the following: referrals to services\nand/or other agencies; exploration of alternative housing; exploration of other\nfunding sources (including HEAP); or the lending of safe supplemental heating\ndevices. Documentation of need for the social services district payment must be\nfully recorded in the applicant's case file. (d) Payment essential to obtain\nnonutility heating fuel. This subdivision applies to recipients of aid to\ndependent children, home relief, veteran assistance, or self-maintaining\ngrantees in receipt of aid to dependent children or home relief on behalf of\ndependent children and in receipt of fuel for heating allowances as outlined in\nsubdivision (b) of this section. An advance allowance subject to recoupment, in\naccordance with section\n352.11\nof this Part, must be\nauthorized for such recipient or grantee when it is documented that the\nrecipient/grantee is the tenant and customer of record for the residential\nheating bill, as defined in subdivision (a) of this section, and when the\nrecipient/grantee has made a request in writing for such an allowance and also\nhas requested in writing that the monthly grant be reduced to recover the\nadvance allowance. This provision is applicable in those cases where the\nrecipient/grantee's nonutility heating bill includes costs for the\nrecipient/grantee's own residential unit and for other residential units. Once\nan initial payment has been authorized for a recipient/grantee whose nonutility\nheating bill includes costs for the recipient/grantee's own residential unit\nand for other residential units, subsequent payments to obtain nonutility\nheating fuel for that recipient/grantee may only be authorized for deliveries\nmade on an alternate basis with the other unit(s) sharing the fuel source. Prior to issuing payment for each subsequent delivery, it must be documented\nthat heating fuel in amounts reasonably comparable to the most recent delivery\npaid for by the social services district has been provided by or on behalf of\nthe other unit(s) sharing the fuel source. When the alternate delivery\nrequirement has not been met or cannot be documented, the social services\ndistrict must address the recipient/grantee's heating emergency with\nalternative methods. These methods include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing: referrals to services and/or other agencies; exploration of\nalternative housing; exploration of other funding sources (including HEAP); or\nlending of safe supplemental heating devices. (e) Payment essential to continue or\nrestore utility service for an applicant for family assistance, safety net\nassistance, veteran assistance or emergency public assistance. A payment must be made for utilities previously provided\nto an applicant for family assistance, safety net assistance, veteran\nassistance or emergency public assistance if such payment is essential to\ncontinue or restore utility service. Payment essential to continue or restore\nutility service may be provided to an applicant whose utility bill includes\ncosts for service for the applicant's own residential unit and for space\noutside that unit. Payment may only be made when it is documented that the\napplicant is the tenant of record and the customer of record, as defined in\nsubdivision (a) of this section, and alternative payment or housing\naccommodations cannot be made and the applicant is without liquid resources to\ncontinue or restore utility service. Payment must not exceed the cost of\nutilities provided to the applicant during the four most recently completed\nmonthly billing periods or two most recently completed bi-monthly billing\nperiods for which a bill has been issued immediately preceding the date of\napplication for such assistance. Payment is limited to the applicant's\nproportionate share of the cost of service for the most recently completed four\nmonthly or two most recently completed bi-monthly billing periods for which a\nbill has been issued immediately preceding the date of application for such\nassistance when the applicant's utility bill includes costs for service for the\napplicant's own residential unit and for space outside that unit. Payment must\nnot exceed the balance due on the account. In a shared meter situation subject\nto the provisions of section\n52\nof the\n\nPublic Service Law, the proportionate share is to be determined by the utility\ncompany's apportionment of retroactive charges upon completion of a shared\nmeter investigation and determination. As a condition of receiving such\nassistance, an applicant not in receipt of recurring public assistance or\nsupplemental security income whose gross monthly household income on the date\nof application exceeds the public assistance standard of need for the same size\nhousehold must sign an agreement to repay the assistance within two years of\nthe date of the payment. A household consists of all persons who occupy a\nhousing unit. A house, an apartment or other group of rooms, or a single room\nis regarded as a housing unit when it is occupied or intended for occupancy as\nseparate living quarters. A household includes related family members and all\nunrelated persons, if any, such as lodgers, foster children, wards, or\nemployees who share the housing unit. A person living alone, or a group of\nunrelated persons sharing a housing unit as partners, also constitutes a\nhousehold. The public assistance standard of need is determined by applying the\nfollowing statewide standards of need in accordance with office regulations: the pre-add allowance as set forth in Schedule SA-2a of section\n352.3\nof this Part; the shelter\nallowance as paid, but not to exceed the maximum allowance set forth in section\n352.3\nof this Part; the fuel\nallowance set forth in Schedule SA-6a, SA-6b or SA-6c of section\n352.5\nof this Part, if the\napplicant is the tenant of record and customer of record for the residential\nheating bill; the home energy and supplemental home energy payments (HEA and\nSHEA) as set forth in schedule SA-2b or SA-2c of section\n352.1\nof this Part; and, if\napplicable, the additional cost of meals for persons unable to prepare meals at\nhome as set forth in schedule SA-5 of section\n352.7\nof this Part. The repayment\nagreement must set forth a schedule of payments that will assure repayment\nwithin two years of the date of payment. Subsequent assistance to continue or\nrestore utility service must not be provided unless any prior utility arrearage\npayments have been repaid or are being repaid in accordance with the schedule\nof payments contained in each prior repayment agreement as of the date of\napplication for such subsequent assistance, or unless the enforcement of such\nprior repayment agreement(s) is suspended by the local social services district\nduring a period of cold weather, defined, for these purposes, as the time\nperiod from November 1st of each year and ending April 15th of the following\nyear. Repayment agreements under this subdivision may be enforced in any manner\navailable to a creditor, in addition to any other remedy the district may have\npursuant to the Social Services Law. (f) Payment essential to continue or restore\nutility service for a recipient of aid to dependent children, home relief, veteran assistance, or self-maintaining grantee in receipt of public assistance\nfor dependent children and in receipt of a home energy allowance and\nsupplemental home energy allowance (HEA and SHEA) and/or a fuel for heating\nallowance, as defined in subdivision (b) of this section. For purposes of this\nsubdivision, the term\nrecipient\nis defined as: a recipient of\naid to dependent children, home relief, veteran assistance, or a\nself-maintaining grantee in receipt of public assistance on behalf of dependent\nchildren and in receipt of a HEA and SHEA and/or a fuel for heating allowance, as defined in subdivision (b) of this section. (1)\nA payment must be made for utilities\npreviously provided to a recipient of aid to dependent children, home relief, veteran assistance or grantee in receipt of public assistance for dependent\nchildren and in receipt of a HEA and SHEA and/or a fuel for heating allowance, as defined in subdivision (b) of this section if such payment is essential to\ncontinue or restore utility service. Payment essential to continue or restore\nutility service may be provided to a recipient whose utility bill includes\ncosts for service for the recipient's own residential unit and for space\noutside that unit. Payment may only be granted when it is documented that the\nrecipient/grantee is the tenant and customer of record, as defined in\nsubdivision (a) of this section and when alternative payment or housing\naccommodations cannot be made and the recipient is without liquid resources to\ncontinue or restore utility service. Payment must not exceed the cost of\nutilities provided to the recipient for the four most recently completed\nmonthly billing periods or two most recently completed bi-monthly billing\nperiods in which service was rendered within the 10 monthly or five bi-monthly\nmost recently completed billing periods immediately preceding the date of\nrequest for such assistance. When the recipient's utility bill includes costs\nfor service for the recipient's own residential unit and for space outside that\nunit, payment is limited to the recipient's proportionate share of the cost of\nservice for the time frames outlined above. In a shared meter situation subject\nto the provisions of section\n52\nof the\n\nPublic Service Law, the proportionate share is to be determined by the utility\ncompany's apportionment of retroactive charges upon completion of a shared\nmeter investigation and determination. Payment must not exceed the balance due\non the account and must be provided in accordance with the provisions of\nparagraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nPayment must be provided as a\nnonrecoupable grant when it is documented that during the period specified in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision the recipient has fully applied the public\nassistance grant to purposes intended to be included in such grant. Such\ndocumentation for recipients must include proof of payment of: an amount at\nleast equal to the combined Home Energy Allowance and Supplemental Home Energy\n\nAllowance (HEA and SHEA) budgeted in the public assistance grant to domestic\n(lights, cooking, hot water) energy costs; the monthly fuel for heating\nallowance budgeted in the public assistance grant to incurred heating costs; and the monthly shelter allowance budgeted in the public assistance grant to\nshelter costs. In addition, there must be no other evidence of\nmismanagement. (3)\n\nIf such\nrecipient is not eligible for a nonrecoupable grant pursuant to paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision, or for other available nonrecoupable grants including Home\n\nEnergy Assistance Program benefits, payment must be provided as an advance\nallowance subject to recoupment in accordance with section\n352.11\nof this Part. (4)\n\nWhenever a social services district makes\nan arrearage payment to continue or restore the utility service of a public\nassistance recipient, the district must also, prospectively for a period of six\nmonths or until the case is closed, whichever occurs first, act as a guarantor\nof the recipient's future utility bills or place the recipient on voucher\npayment. When the recipient is the customer of record for a utility bill which\nincludes costs for service for the recipient's own residential unit and for\nspace outside that unit, only the recipient's proportionate share of the bill\nis the prospective responsibility of the social services district. (5)\n\nIf the agency uses a voucher payment to\nmeet the prospective responsibility for an ADC recipient the agency must be\nable to document recipient mismanagement. For the purposes of this subdivision, mismanagement is determined in accordance with the provisions outlined in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. In such cases, amounts not to exceed the\nfollowing are restricted from the recipient's grant: (i) if the recipient's utility bill\nrepresents \"heat only,\" the recipient's monthly fuel for heating allowance is\nremoved from the recipient's monthly grant. Heating costs paid by the district\nwhich exceed the amount removed from the recipient's grant are considered to be\noverpayments subject to recoupment in accordance with section\n352.31\n(d) of this\n\nPart; (ii)\nif the recipient's\nutility bill represents domestic costs only (lights, cooking, hot water), the\nrecipient's Home Energy Allowance and Supplemental Home Energy Allowance (HEA\nand SHEA) or the average monthly cost of the recipient's domestic utility\nservice, whichever is less, is removed from the recipient's grant. Domestic\nenergy costs paid by the district which exceed the amount removed from the\ngrant must be considered to be overpayments subject to recoupment in accordance\nwith section\n352.31\n(d) of this\n\nPart; (iii)\nif the recipient's\nutility bill represents heat and domestic costs, a combination of the amounts\noutlined in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph is removed from the\ngrant. If the recipient's combined heat and domestic costs exceed the amounts\nremoved from the recipient's grant, the balance must be considered an\noverpayment subject to recoupment in accordance with section\n352.31\n(d) of this\n\nPart. (6)\n\nIf the agency\nuses a vendor payment to meet the prospective responsibility for an HR\nrecipient, the agency may do so in accordance with section\n381.3\n(c)(2)\nof\nthis Title. (7)\n\nWhen a recipient\nhas been placed on vendor payment, whereby the social services district pays\nthe energy vendor directly, as a result of mismanagement by the recipient or\nfor administrative ease, the district must at least annually, at case closing, and upon termination of the vendor payment arrangement, determine if there has\nbeen an under/overpayment. Identified underpayments/overpayments are to be\nreconciled in accordance with section\n352.31\n(d), (e), and/or (f) of this Part. (g) (1)\n\nFor\nrecipients with heating costs in excess of their annual allowance provided\npursuant to the schedules set forth in this section, the district should\nexplore the possibility of alternative housing (renters only) and/or\nweatherization/conservation services. (2)\n\nRecipients who retain responsibility for\nthe payment of their own heating bills should be made aware of and encouraged\nto use budget billing programs offered by their heating vendors. (3)\n\nWhen the heating and/or domestic energy\nbill of a public assistance recipient/grantee has been placed on vendor payment\nas a result of a mismanagement determination, voluntary request, or\nadministrative ease provision, the district must determine if there has been an\nunder/overpayment. This reconciliation must be conducted at least annually, at\ncase closing, and upon termination of the vendor payment arrangement. Identified under/overpayments are to be reconciled in accordance with section\n352.31\n(d), (e), and/or (f) of this Part. (h) The social services official must\ndesignate a staff member to function as a liaison to energy vendors, other\nagencies, and to individuals seeking energy-related information and/or\nassistance. (i) The social services\nofficial must ensure that 24-hour/seven-day-a-week referral capability exists\nfor receipt of referrals from energy vendors, outside agencies, and individuals\nwith energy- related emergencies. The official may either designate social\nservices district staff to be available on a 24-hour, seven days a week basis\nor may choose to designate an agency/organization in the community which agrees\nto accept calls after normal business hours and on weekends and to assist a\nreferred household in the temporary alleviation of a life-threatening energy\nemergency until the household can make application for financial assistance on\nthe next normal business day.
