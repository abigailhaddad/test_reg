  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 50.21 - Method of valuation\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following method shall be used in the valuation of\ninvestments: (a) Investments shall be\nvalued by reference to appropriate valuations applied by a generally accepted\npricing service, or by the methods set forth below. All estimates, quotation\nsheets and valuations used for valuations shall be retained in the records of\nthe mutual trust investment company. (b) (1)\n\nIn\nthe case of an obligation of the United States, or of an obligation for which\nthe faith of the United States is pledged for the payment of the interest and\nprincipal, the mutual trust investment company shall use for the valuation of\nsuch investment the mean of the most recent dealer bid and asked prices\nappearing within the five business days next preceding the valuation date in\nnewspapers or general circulation published in the City of New York, in\nstandard financial periodicals or in current dealer communications. Obligations\nof the United States which may be redeemable at less than par prior to maturity\nor which are not saleable without exchange shall be valued at par. (2)\n\nIn the case of a security listed on a\nnational securities exchange registered under section 6 of the Federal\n\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, or on the NASDAQ National Market, the mutual\ntrust investment company shall use for the valuation thereof the last reported\nsale price, unless there have been no reported sales within the five business\ndays preceding the valuation date in which event the most recent bid price\nshall be used. For the purpose of this paragraph, reported sales prices and bid\nprices shall be those appearing in newspapers of general circulation published\nin the city of New York, in standard financial periodicals, or on the records\nof a registered national exchange or the National Association of Securities\n\nDealers. If the mutual trust investment company believes that the last reported\nsales price or bid price does not fairly represent the values of the security, then the company may, after expressing that view in writing for its records\nalong with the reasons for it, use as an alternative the valuation method in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nIf neither recorded sales nor bid and\nasked prices are available as provided above, and in the case of all\ninvestments other than those mentioned above, except investments in mortgages, the mutual trust investment company shall obtain from not less than two\nbankers, brokers, dealers or other persons qualified in the opinion of the\nmutual trust investment company to give an opinion as to the value of the\ninvestment in question a written estimate of the value of such investment as of\nthe close of business on the last business day prior to the valuation date. The\naverage of such estimates shall be used, and each such estimate shall be\nretained in the records of the mutual trust investment company. (c) For the purposes of this Part, a business day shall mean a day when the New York Stock Exchange or the\n\nAmerican Stock Exchange is open for business. (d) In the case of investments in mortgages, the mutual trust investment company shall secure, prior to any valuation date, from not less than two persons qualified in the opinion of the mutual trust\ninvestment company to give an opinion as to the value of the mortgage in\nquestion, a written estimate of the value of such mortgage. At least one of the\npersons making such valuation shall not have participated in the making of the\nlast preceding valuation. The average of such estimates shall be used and each\nsuch estimate shall be retained in the records of the mutual trust investment\ncompany. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the mutual trust\ninvestment company shall have in its files such a written estimate of value\nmade within one year of the valuation date, such estimate may be used. The real\nestate securing each such mortgage investment shall be appraised at least once\nevery three years by two persons, one of whom shall not have participated in\nthe last preceding appraisal of such real estate. Such persons shall be\nappointed by the mutual trust investment company and shall, in the opinion of\nsuch mutual trust investment company, be familiar with real estate values in\nthe vicinity in which such real estate is situated and qualified to make such\nappraisals. The persons so appointed shall actually inspect such real estate\nand shall so certify in a written certificate of appraisal, which shall be\nfiled and preserved in the records of the mutual trust investment company. In\npreparing a written estimate of the value of any mortgage, due consideration\nshall be given, by the persons making such valuation, to the last written\ncertificate of appraisal of the property covered by such mortgage. (e) In the case of a stock where a dividend\nhas been declared but has not been paid and the amount of such dividend has\nbeen considered as income under the bylaws of the mutual trust investment\ncompany, the amount of such dividend shall be deducted from the price of the\nstock in determining its value unless such price shall be an ex-dividend\nprice. (f) An investment purchased\nand awaiting payment against delivery shall be included for valuation purposes\nas a security held, and the cash amount shall be adjusted to reflect the\npurchase price, including brokers' commissions and other expenses incurred in\nthe purchase thereof but not disbursed as of the valuation date. (g) An investment sold but not delivered\npending receipt of proceeds shall be valued at the net sales price. (h) For the purpose of valuation of an\ninvestment, except an investment sold but not delivered, it shall not be\nnecessary to deduct from the value ascertained, as provided above, brokers'\ncommissions or other expenses which would be incurred upon a sale\nthereof. (i) There shall be\ndeducted from any gross asset value, computed as aforesaid, the amount of all\nexpenses incurred and accrued and unpaid, such reserves as may be set up to\ncover taxes and any other liabilities, and such other deductions as in the\nopinion of the board of directors are in accordance with sound accounting\npractices.
