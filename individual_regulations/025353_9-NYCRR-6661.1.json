  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6661.1 - Purpose and scope\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Chapter sets forth procedures for administering, on a pilot basis, the\n\nCombined Senior Citizen Services Center, Residential Health-Care Facility and\n\nChild Day-Care Center Community Grants Program within New York State under\nchapter 841 of the Laws of 1987. (b) There is a continuing need for\nmaintaining the aged in the mainstream of society by providing services and\nopportunities for socialization and meaningful activity. It has been the policy\nof the State of New York to increase the level of safe, efficient and\nhigh-quality child-care services. The maintenance of qualified personnel in\nresidential health-care facilities has been of concern to the State; day-care\ncenters in the workplace have served as a means for acquiring and retaining\npersonnel. Therefore, this coordinated and combined approach to these services\nis intended to assist the State in addressing the need for such services in a\nmanner that would be cost-efficient and of social benefit to the clients they\nserve. The purpose of this program is to promote innovative and cost-effective\nmeans of providing existing or proposed senior citizen services centers or\nresidential health-care facilities and child day-care centers in a combined\ncenter. (c) In accordance with this\nlegislative purpose, the Office shall determine and take appropriate action to\nensure that adequate notice is given to the public concerning the availability\nof funds for this program. (d) This\n\nChapter shall expire and be of no further force or effect upon the expiration\nof chapter 841 of the Laws of 1987. At the time these regulations were\npromulgated, such chapter was scheduled to expire on December 31, 1990. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n6661.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
