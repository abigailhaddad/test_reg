  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 380-11.3 - Table I Occupational Values\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Note that the columns in Table I of section\n380-11.7\nof this subpart captioned\n\"Oral Ingestion ALI,\" \"Inhalation ALI,\" and \"DAC,\" are applicable to\noccupational exposure to radioactive material. (b) The ALIs in section\n380-11.7\nof this Subpart are the\nannual intakes of given radionuclide by \"Reference Man\" which would result in\neither\n(1)\na committed effective dose\nequivalent of five rems (stochastic ALI) or\n(2)\na committed dose equivalent of 50 rems to\nan organ or tissue (non-stochastic ALI). The stochastic ALIs were derived to\nresult in a risk, due to irradiation of organs and tissues, comparable to the\nrisk associated with deep dose equivalent to the whole body of five rems. The\nderivation includes multiplying the committed dose equivalent to an organ or\ntissue by a weighting factor, Wt. This weighting factor is the proportion of\nthe risk of stochastic effects resulting from irradiation of the organ or\ntissue, T, to the total risk of stochastic effects when the whole body is\nirradiated uniformly. The values of Wt are listed under the definition of\nweighting factor in section\n380-2.1\nof this Part. The\nnon-stochastic ALIs were derived to avoid non-stochastic effects, such as\nprompt damage to tissue or reduction in organ function. (c) A value of Wt = 0.06 is applicable to\neach of the five organs or tissues in the \"remainder\" category receiving the\nhighest dose equivalents, and the dose equivalents of all other remaining\ntissues may be disregarded. The following parts of the GI tract -- stomach, small intestine, upper large intestine, and lower large intestine -- are to be\ntreated as four separate organs. (d) Note that the dose equivalents for\nextremities (hands and forearms, feet and lower legs), skin, and lens of the\neye are not considered in computing the committed effective dose equivalent, but are subject to limits that must be met separately. (e) When an ALI is defined by the stochastic\ndose limit, this value alone, is given. When an ALI is determined by the\nnon-stochastic dose limit to an organ, the organ or tissue to which the limit\napplies is shown, and the ALI for the stochastic limit is shown in parentheses. (Abbreviated organ or tissue designations are used: LLI wall = lower large\nintestine wall; St. wall = stomach wall; Blad wall = bladder wall; and Bone\nsurf = bone surface.)\n(f) The use\nof the ALIs listed first, the more limiting of the stochastic and\nnon-stochastic ALIs, will ensure that non-stochastic effects are avoided and\nthat the risk of stochastic effects is limited to an acceptably low value. If, in a particular situation involving a radionuclide for which the non-stochastic\nALI is limiting, use of that non-stochastic ALI is considered unduly\nconservative, the licensee may use the stochastic ALI to determine the\ncommitted effective dose equivalent. However, the licensee shall also ensure\nthat the 50-rem dose equivalent limit for any organ or tissue is not exceeded\nby the sum of the external deep dose equivalent plus the internal committed\ndose to that organ (not the effective dose). For the case where there is no\nexternal dose contribution, this would be demonstrated if the sum of the\nfractions of the nonstochastic ALIs (ALIns) that contribute to the committed\ndose equivalent to the organ receiving the highest dose does not exceed unity\n(i.e., [SIGMA]; (intake (in µCi) of each\nradionuclide/ALI\nins\n) < 1.0). If there is an external\ndeep dose equivalent contribution of Hd then this sum must be less than one -\n(Hd/50) instead of being < 1.0. (g) The derived air concentration (DAC)\nvalues are derived limits intended to control chronic occupational exposures. The relationship between the DAC and the ALI is given by: DAC = ALI(in\nµCi)/(2000 hours per working year x 60 minutes/hour x 2 x\n10\n4\nml per minute) = (ALI/2.4 x\n10\n9\n) µCi/ml, where 2 x\n10\n4\nml per minute is the volume of air breathed per\nminute at work by reference man under working conditions of light work. (h) The DAC values relate to one\nof two modes of exposure: either external submersion or the internal committed\ndose equivalents resulting from inhalation of radioactive materials. Derived\nair concentrations based upon submersion are for immersion in a semi-infinite\ncloud of uniform concentration and apply to each radionuclide\nseparately. (i) The ALI and DAC\nvalues relate to exposure to the single radionuclide named, but also include\ncontributions from the ingrowth of any daughter radionuclide produced in the\nbody by the decay of the parent. However, intakes that include both the parent\nand daughter radionuclides should be treated by the general method appropriate\nfor mixtures. (j) The value of ALI\nand DAC do not apply directly when the individual both ingests and inhales a\nradionuclide, when the individual is exposed to a mixture of radionuclides by\neither inhalation or ingestion or both, or when the individual is exposed to\nboth internal and external irradiation. When an individual is exposed to\nradioactive materials which fall under several of the translocation\nclassifications (i.e., Class D, Class W, or Class Y) of the same radionuclide, the exposure may be evaluated as if it were a mixture of different\nradionuclides. (k) It should be\nnoted that the classification of a compound as Class D, W, or Y is based on the\nchemical form of the compound and does not take into account the radiological\nhalf-life of different radioisotopes. For this reason, values are given for\n\nClass D, W, and Y compounds, even for very short-lived radionuclides. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
