  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1500.5 - Electrical requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nNew electrically operated\ninterior fire alarm systems shall be constantly supervised by the continuous\nflow of an electric current through the system. Any interruption of electric\ncurrent through the system or any circuit trouble shall cause a trouble signal\nto be sounded which is audible to an authorized person satisfactory to the\ndepartment. Such trouble signal shall sound until silenced by manual means or\nrestoration of supervisory current flow by correction of circuit trouble. Silencing of trouble signal by manual means shall automatically transfer such\nsignal to a red lamp. Trouble signal shall be operated from the auxiliary\nsource of power, except that where a single source of power is permitted, the\ntrouble signal shall be operated from a side or phase of the power supply\nseparate from that operating the signaling system. Sounding devices not readily\nsusceptible to electrical supervision, such as vibrating bells, will not be\nrequired to be so supervised provided such sounding devices are alternately\nconnected to separate circuits and are approximately equally distributed\nthroughout the building. (2)\n\nNew\nelectric equipment shall be designed and constructed to operate satisfactorily\nat voltages of 25 per cent above or below normal, or in accordance with\ngenerally accepted standards as set forth in the appendix to these\nrules.[FN*]\n(3)\n\nCircuits used for\nthe transmission of alarms shall be used for fire protection purposes only and\nshall be arranged and installed so that there can be no interference with the\noperation of the sounding devices. (b) Electrical wiring. (1)\n\nNew electrical wiring for fire alarm\nsystems shall have a rating of not less than 300 volts, except that on systems\ndesigned for operation at 50 volts or less, electrical wiring having a rating\nof not less than 150 volts may be used for circuits where the input is limited\nto 100 volt-amperes with current not exceeding five amperes. (2)\n\nSizes of such electrical wiring shall be\nin accordance with generally accepted standards as set forth in the appendix to\nthese rules. *\n(3)\n\nNew electrical\nwiring shall be satisfactorily protected against damage due to corrosion, moisture or mechanical injury. (4)\n\nNew electrical wiring shall be protected by a metallic raceway or armor, except\nthat such raceway or armor shall not be required for wiring installed at least\nseven feet above the floor for circuits where the input is limited to 100\nvolt-amperes with current not exceeding five amperes on systems designed for\noperation at 50 volts or less. (5)\n\nNew raceways, boxes, fittings and cabinets containing fire alarm conductors\nshall not contain wiring used for any purpose other than fire\nprotection. (c) Power\nsupply. (1)\nA new fire alarm system shall be\nsupplied with electrical energy from a main source and, in case of failure of\nthe main source, from an auxiliary source, except that where electric service\nof three, four, or five-wire type is obtained from a reliable underground\nnetwork distribution system, the auxiliary source shall not be required. The\nfollowing are acceptable sources for main and auxiliary power supplies: central\nelectric power station (local utility company) and an electric generator or one\nset of storage battery units continually charged; two electric generators; two\nsets of storage battery units continually charged; one electric generator and\none set of storage battery units continually charged. A sufficient number of\nheavy duty primary batteries of suitable type and of adequate capacity shall be\npermitted as the auxiliary source of power supply when approved by the\ndepartment. (2)\n\nOne source of power\nshall be connected to the fire alarm system at all times. The auxiliary source\nshall be automatically controlled so that when the primary source fails, the\nauxiliary source will be connected automatically to the system and the transfer\nshall be indicated by a signal. Immediate steps shall be taken to return the\nsystem to the primary source of supply. (3)\nA new fire alarm service connection to a\ncentral power station supply shall be made as close as practicable to the main\nservice entrance with either of the following arrangements: connection made on\nthe street side of the service switch, or connection made on the house side of\nthe meter and as close to the meter as possible without intervening\ninterrupting devices. (4)\n\nBetween\nfire alarm service connection, as described in paragraph (3) above, and the\ncontrol board, only one set of protective devices will be permitted; no\nadditional devices are permitted. (5)\nA new fire alarm service connection to a\npower supply other than that from a central power station shall be made with\nonly one set of protective devices in addition to any set of devices used to\nprotect the main source of supply. (6)\n\nFire alarm system protective devices\nshall be contained in a locked or sealed metal cabinet which shall be\nconspicuously identified. The use of open link or screw plug fuses shall not be\npermitted. [FN*] See Appendix S-2. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n1500.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
