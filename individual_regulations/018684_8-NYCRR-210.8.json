  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 210.8 - General and miscellaneous provisions for supplemental relocation payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applications\nfor supplemental relocation payment. Applications for all supplemental\nrelocation pavments must be made and filed with the commissioner no later than\n18 months after the date on which the displaced person was required to vacate\nthe dwelling acquired, or six months after final award determination in a case\nlitigated in the courts of the State, whichever is the later. (b) Payments on assignments described herein\nmay be made, upon a written instruction and assignment from the displaced\nperson, directly to a lessor for rent or to a seller for application on a\npayment for a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling. (c) Partial takings. In the instance where\nthe dwelling and homesite are only a part of the total taking from the same\nproperty, the value of the dwelling and the necessary supporting homesite are\nto be segregated from the total appraised compensation in calculating any\nsupplemental relocation payment. (d) Dwellings in excess of three units. Where\nthe real property being acquired is improved by a dwelling having more than\nthree dwelling units, the owner is not eligible for the supplemental relocation\npayment of the $5,000 maximum, but if he occupies one of the dwelling units, he\nis eligible to receive the up-to $1,500 payment if other eligibility\nrequirements are met. (e) Mobile\nhomes. A mobile home may be considered a replacement dwelling providing it\nsubstantially meets requirements for decent, safe and sanitary dwellings. (1)\n\nIn the instance where a determination has\nbeen made that a mobile home to be acquired is classified as real property, and\nthe occupant owns both mobile home and site, the following supplemental\nrelocation payments apply: (i) If the one\nyear residency requirement is met, the supplemental relocation payment would be\ncomputed on the basis of the difference between the amount paid for the mobile\nhome and site and the estimated cost of acquiring a comparable mobile home and\nsite, up to a maximum of $5,000. (ii)\n\nIf the one year residency requirement is\nnot met, but the 90 day residency requirement is met or if the owner elects not\nto purchase a replacement dwelling, the supplemental relocation payment would\nbe calculated as follows: the difference between the cost of renting an\nadequate, comparable, decent, safe and sanitary mobile home for the next two\nyears and 12 percent of the acquisition price of the property acquired, up to a\nmaximum of $1,500. This payment may be used as a rent supplement or for the\ndown payment on the purchase of replacement housing. (2)\n\nMobile home tenants.If an occupant does\nnot own a mobile home, such displaced tenant of the mobile home would be\nentitled to receive a rent differential payment of up to $1,500 as in the case\nof any other residential tenant, assuming all other eligibility standards have\nbeen met. (3)\n\nWhen a comparable\nmobile home dwelling is not available, the supplemental relocation payment is\nto be calculated on the basis of the next higher type dwelling that is\navailable and meets the applicable requirements and standards, i.e., a higher\ntype mobile home or a conventional dwelling. (4)\n\nThe one year and 90 day occupancy\nrequirements are to be calculated on the basis of the time the owner or tenant\nhas occupied the mobile home on the site from which he is displaced. (5)\n\nWhere the commissioner determines that a\nsufficient portion of a mobile home park is taken to justify the operator of\nsuch park to move his business or go out of business and the operator does in\nfact move or go out of business, the owners and occupants of the mobile home\ndwellings not within the actual taking but who are forced to move are eligible\nto receive the same payments as though their dwellings were within the actual\ntaking.
