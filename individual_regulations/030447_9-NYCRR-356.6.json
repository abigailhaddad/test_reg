  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 356.6 - Probation Intake\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prior to\ncommencing eligibility and suitability determination, probation shall review\nthe complaint to determine whether it is within the scope of FCA article\n3. (b) Eligibility Criteria: Cases\nwithin the scope of FCA article 3 shall be considered eligible for adjustment\nservices, except when one or more of the below-listed exclusionary criteria are\npresent: (1)\nthe potential respondent insists\nupon accessing the presentment agency for the purpose s of having a petition\nfiled, or declines, or is unavailable to participate in the adjustment\nprocess; (2)\nthe presentment agency\nand the family court have not given written approval for adjustment, where such\napproval is required by the FCA §308.1 (4); (3)\nthe family court has not given written\napproval where the alleged conduct of the potential respondent would constitute\na designated felony act as defined by FCA §\n301.2\n(8), as required by FCA\n§308.1(3); and\n(4)\nthe family court\nhas not given written approval for adjustment where the alleged conduct of the\npotential respondent, if committed by an adult, would constitute a class A or B\nfelony which is not a designated felony act. (c) Suitability Criteria: In order to\ndetermine whether the case is suitable for the adjustment process, the\nprobation service shall: (1)\nconsider the\nviews of the complainant and the impact of the alleged act or acts of juvenile\ndelinquency upon the complainant and upon the community; and\n(2)\nconsider the provisions of the URFC\n§205.22(c). (d) Detention\n\nCases: (1)\n\nCoordinate local efforts for the\nscreening of appropriate cases for release, identifying alternative to\ndetention programs and services, and communication with law enforcement and the\ndetention agency. When a youth is detained and the facility is located outside\nof the county of jurisdiction, the probation department in the jurisdiction\nwhere the youth is detained may assist in screening the youth for consideration\nfor release; (i) Determine eligibility for\nprobation intake and adjustment services in accordance with FCA\nprovisions; (ii)\n\nMake a\ndetermination as to whether alternatives to detention are appropriate to avoid\nremand of a youth; (iii)\n\nDetermine\nsuitability for probation intake and adjustment services in accordance with\nURFC provisions; (iv)\n\nConsider the\nresults of a completed state-approved detention risk assessment instrument on\nthe instant offense; (2)\n\nThe fact that a youth is detained prior to the filing of a petition shall not, where authorized, preclude the probation department from adjusting a case. Where feasible, the probation department shall coordinate with the detention\nadministrator to have the youth released on an appearance ticket when screened\nand determined to be eligible and suitable for adjustment services under\n\nArticle 3 of the Family Court Act unless the youth is remanded on a Family\n\nCourt order; (3)\n\nWhen a youth is\nreleased from detention before filing of a petition, and probation operates the\ndetention facility, the agency responsible for operating a detention facility\nshall issue a Family Court Appearance Ticket to the youth and the person\nlegally responsible for the youth's care, in accordance with FCA §§ 307.1 and\n307.3(3). Such Family Court Appearance Tickets shall be issued unless special\ncircumstances exist which require the detention of the youth, including: (i) there is a substantial probability that\nthe youth will not appear or be produced at the appropriate probation\ndepartment at a specified time and place; or\n(ii)\nthere is a serious risk that, before the\npetition is filed, the youth may commit an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime. (4)\n\nWhen a youth is being considered for\nrelease from detention before filing of a petition, and probation does not\noperate the detention facility, Probation shall: (i) Seek the release of detained youth\neligible and suitable for Probation intake and adjustment services; (ii)\n\nSeek the issuance of a Family Court\n\nAppearance Ticket from the agency responsible for operating a detention\nfacility in accordance with FCA §§ 307.1 and 307.3(3). A Family Court\n\nAppearance Ticket shall be issued unless special circumstances exist which\nrequire the detention of the youth, including: (a) there is a substantial probability that\nthe youth will not appear or be produced at the appropriate probation\ndepartment at a specified time and place; or\n(b) there is a serious risk that, before the\npetition is filed, the youth may commit an act which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime. (5)\n\nIf a youth is detained or about to be\ndetained, and the Probation Department's initial review reveals the case may be\nappropriate for release or alternative to detention, the Probation Department\nshall conduct a screening interview with the youth alleged to be a juvenile\ndelinquent to determine eligibility and suitability for adjustment services. i. Screening and interviewing to determine\nsuitability for intake and adjustment services shall take place at the earliest\npossible time after arrest. ii. Probation shall deploy staff and services in a manner consistent with achieving\nthe earliest possible intervention and release. iii. The interview should take place as soon\nas possible to affect the earliest possible release decision. For youth\ndetained after regular business hours, such interviews shall take place within\ntwo (2) business days of detention. (e) Where it is determined that the complaint\nis within the scope of FCA article 3, and both eligible and suitable for\nadjustment services probation shall conduct an initial conference and provide\nsuch services in accordance with URFC. This shall include: (1)\n\nMaking reasonable efforts to confer with\nany persons seeking to have a juvenile delinquency petition filed, the\npotential respondent and other interested persons including the victim or\ncomplainant, on the same day that such persons appear at the probation\ndepartment concerning the advisability of requesting that a juvenile\ndelinquency petition be filed and in order to gather information needed for a\ndetermination of the suitability of the case for adjustment; (2)\n\nPermitting any youth who is represented\nby an attorney to be accompanied by the attorney at any preliminary\nconference; (3)\n\nAscertaining from\nthe complainant pursuant to URFC, a brief statement of the underlying events\nand a brief statement of factors, if known to that person that would assist the\ncourt in determining whether the potential respondent should be detained or\nreleased in the event that a petition is filed; (4)\n\nPromptly informing the complainant, the\npotential respondent, parent or other person legally responsible for his/her\ncare, or any other interested person(s) at the first conference regarding the\npetition and Family Court processes as set forth in the URFC and explain the\nbenefits of probation intake and adjustment and the services that may be made\navailable to address the needs of the youth, as compared to proceeding directly\nto petition; and\n(5)\n\nFor youth\ndetermined to be eligible and suitable for adjustment services, the probation\ndepartment may conduct a pre-screen assessment at the Initial Intake Conference\nusing a state approved, risk and need assessment instrument that measures the\nrisk of recidivism. This assessment may be completed by a Probation Assistant, Probation Officer, or an employee of the Probation department specially trained\nand approved by the Probation Director, and under the direct oversight and\nreview by a Probation Supervisor. (6)\n\nInforming the complainant where it\nappears to probation that the court would not have jurisdiction over the case, and such case is thereby excluded from any opportunity for adjustment. In such\ninstances, the juvenile delinquency complaint filed may be referred to a\npresentment agency for the purpose of requesting that a petition be filed with\nthe court. The reason for excluding the complaint for consideration for\nadjustment shall be documented in the case record. The record shall contain all\nrequired documentation, including a statement of the grounds for not commencing\nadjustment, and a copy of the written notification to the complainant, pursuant\nto URFC.
