  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1647-3.4 - Computation and recording\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Average annual estimate for quarter exceeds actual expense. (1)\n\nAssuming that the average annual\nestimated amount required to be set aside is $9,600, the quarterly amount\nrequired would be $2,400. Assume further that the actual expense incurred for\npainting and decorating during the current quarter amount to $700. Using these\namounts, the computation for the quarter would be as follows: Established quarterly amount allocated for\npainting and decorating\n$2,400\n\nLess: Actual painting and decorating expense for\ncurrent quarter, account 4430\n700\n\nProvision to be made for painting and\ndecorating\n$1,700\n(2)\n\nThe journal voucher recording this\ntransaction on the books of account would be prepared at the end of the quarter\nto read as follows: Debit: Account 4894, Provision for Painting and\n\nDecorating $1,700\n\nCredit: Account 2530, Painting and Decorating Reserve\n$1,700\n(b) Actual expense exceeds average annual estimate for quarter. (1)\n\nUsing the same amounts as in subdivision\n(a) of this section for the established quarterly amount allocated for painting\nand decorating and assuming that the actual expense for painting and decorating\nfor the quarter was $2,800, the computation would be as follows: Established quarterly amount allocated for\npainting and decorating\n$2,400\n\nLess: Actual painting and decorating expense for\ncurrent quarter, account 4430\n2,800\n\nAmount deductible from Painting and Decorating\n\nReserve\n($400)\n(2)\n\nThe journal voucher recording this\ntransaction on the books of account would be prepared at the end of the quarter\nto read as follows: Debit: Account 2530, Painting and Decorating Reserve\n$400\n\nCredit: Account 4894, Provision for Painting and\n\nDecorating $400\n(c) Excess of actual expense over\naverage annual estimate for the quarter exceeds balance in reserve\naccount. (1)\n\nUsing the same figures as\nin subdivision (a), above, for the established quarterly amount allocated for\npainting and decorating, assume that the actual expense for painting and\ndecorating for the quarter to be $4,300. Assume further that at the end of the\nprevious quarter the balance in account 2530, Painting and Decorating Reserve, was $1,500. Using these amounts, the computation would be as follows: Established quarterly amount allocated for\npainting and decorating\n$2,400\n\nLess: Actual painting and decorating expense for\ncurrent quarter, account 4430\n4,300\n\nAmount computed as being deductible from Painting\nand Decorating Reserve\n($1,900)\n\nBalance available in Painting and Decorating\n\nReserve, account 2530\n$1,500\n\nAmount deductible from Painting and Decorating\n\nReserve\n$1,500\n(2)\n\nThe journal voucher recording this\ntransaction on the books of account would be prepared at the end of the quarter\nto read as follows: Debit: Account 2530, Painting and Decorating\n\nReserve............................................................................................. $1,500............................................................................................. Credit: Account 4894, Provision for Painting and\n\nDecorating $1,500.............. (3)\n\nAs a result of the entry, account 2530, Painting and Decorating Reserve would have a zero balance. (d) Re-establishment of reserve\nfollowing complete exhaustion of balance. The effect of the provisions of section\n1647-3.2\nis to ensure that, after\nthe reserve has been depleted, excesses of actual expenses over the average\nannual estimate for a quarter because of depletion of the reserve will be\nabsorbed by the excess of the average annual estimate over actual expenses in\nsubsequent quarters of the fiscal year before further provision is made for the\nreserve. Excesses of actual expenses over average annual estimates not charged\nagainst the reserve shall not, however, be carried forward into subsequent\nfiscal years. The operation of these provisions is illustrated in the following\nexample: Quarter\nending\n\nActual P&D\nexpense\n\nAverage annual\nestimate\n\nDifference\nP&D Reserve Acct. 2530\n\nBalance as of March 31, 1948\n$2,000\n6/30/48\n$7,400\n$5,000\n($2,400)\n(2,000)\n\nDepleted\n9/30/48\n6,000\n5,000\n(1,000)\n-0-\n12/31/48\n3,500\n5,000\n1,500\n100\n\nRe-established\n$16,900\n$15,000\n$1,900\n$100\n(1)\n\nThis\nexample shows that the reserve was depleted at the end of the first quarter of\nthe fiscal year and that only $2,000 of the $2,400 excess of actual expense\nover the average annual estimate could be charged against the reserve leaving a\nbalance of $400 not charged against the reserve. In the second quarter, the\nactual expense exceeded the average annual estimate by $1,000, but since the\nreserve had been depleted in the previous quarter, no part of this excess could\nbe charged against the reserve. The total excess not charged against the\nreserve now aggregates $1,400 for the half-year. In the third quarter, the\naverage annual estimate exceeded the actual expense by $1,500. In\nre-establishing the reserve, the $1,500 excess of the average annual estimate\nover actual expenses for the quarter would first be applied to meeting the\n$1,400 excess expenses not charged against the reserve and only the balance of\n$100 would be set aside in the reserve. The journal voucher at December 31, 1948 would be prepared to read as follows: Debit: Account 4894, Provision for Painting and\n\nDecorating................................................................................................... $100................................................................................................... Credit: Account 2530, Painting and Decorating\n\nReserve... $1,500........................... (2)\n\nIf, at the end of the fiscal year, there\nremained excess expenses not charged against the reserve, because of depletion\nthereof, such excess would not be used to reduce the amount by which the\nreserve would otherwise be established in the subsequent fiscal year, as\nillustrated in the following example: Quarter\nending\n\nActual P&D expense\n\nAverage annual estimate\n\nDifference\nP&D Reserve Acct. 2530\n\nBalance December 31, 1948\n$100\n3/31/49\n$5,200\n$5,000\n($200)\n(100)\n\nEnd of fiscal year\n-0-\n6/30/49\n$4,900\n$5,000\n$100\n$100\n\nRe-established\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
