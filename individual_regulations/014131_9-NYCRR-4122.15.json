  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4122.15 - Payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Payments due on\nall wagers shall be made in conformity with well-established practice of the\npari-mutuel system. The practice is to work in dollars and not in the number of\ntickets. Money wagered on winning tickets is returned in full plus the profits. In all cases of a winning mutuel pool, each association must redistribute not\nless than $1.05 on each $1 wager and $2.10 on each $2 wager. (b) Payments on all winning pari-mutuel\ntickets and tickets refundable according to rules shall be made only on\npresentation and surrender of appropriate ticket. Mutilated tickets and those\nwhose validity are questioned shall be submitted to the New York State Tax\n\nCommission for inspection. (c) In\nthe discretion of management or by direction of the commission, payments may be\nmade by cash or check to the holder of a winning pari-mutuel ticket from whom\nidentification may be required. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4122.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
