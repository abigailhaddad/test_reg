In addition, no person shall import or move captive cervids into the\n\nState or within the State for any purpose, including slaughter unless a\nmovement permit authorizing such movement has been obtained from the department\nprior to such movement. An application for movement permit may be obtained by\ncalling the department during normal business hours and, when submitted for a\nherd located within the State, must be accompanied by the most recent\n\nInspection Report. In the event that an applicant for a movement permit is\nrequired to but does not possess the most recent Inspection Report, the\ndepartment will replace the Inspection Report upon payment of an amount\ncommensurate with the department's cost in doing so. Except for cervids moving\ndirectly to slaughter, movement permits shall be issued only for captive\ncervids that meet the New York State animal health requirements for captive\ncervids of this Part. All cervids to be moved, other than cervids moving\ndirectly to slaughter, must have approved, unique and tamper evident\nidentification prior to movement. The removal or alteration of any official\nform of animal identification without the prior permission of the department is\nprohibited. (d) Enforcement.

Capture and restraint of captive cervids shall\nbe the responsibility of the owner. (f) Fencing. All captive cervid operations shall establish a continuous\nbarrier fence designed and constructed to prevent the escape of captive cervids\nand the entry of free ranging cervids.

Separate herd inventories, biosecurity, records, working\nfacilities, watering facilities, equipment and land use shall be maintained for\neach distinct herd for which an individual CWD or tuberculosis status is\nsought, irrespective of ownership. No commingling of animals shall occur\nbetween distinct herds with individual disease status unless program movement\nrequirements for herd status are met. Movement of animals between such herds\nshall be recorded as if they were separately owned herds. (h) Sample collection. Individuals who have passed State or USDA approved sample\ncollection training may collect and submit samples to support tuberculosis and\nCWD program requirements. (i) Premises location. All captive cervid locations shall be identified by a\n\nFederal premises identification number issued by the department and USDA/APHIS.
