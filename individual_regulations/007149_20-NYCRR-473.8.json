  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 473.8 - Lessee as carrier\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 501(5)\n(a) Many motor vehicles subject to the\nprovisions of article 21 of the Tax Law are leased to others for varying\nperiods of time. There immediately arises the question of whether the owner or\nthe lessee of the motor vehicle should obtain the permit. (b) Under the law every lessee having direct\ncontrol of a motor vehicle is a carrier thereof. However, to avoid the issuance\nof numerous permits for the same motor vehicle, if the owner has already\nsecured a permit for a particular vehicle, a lessee under a lease for 30 days\nor less may, but is not required to, obtain a permit. Therefore, only a lessee\nunder a lease or agreement covering a period of more than 30 consecutive days\nis required to obtain a permit; provided, however, that if such vehicle is not\nto be operated in this State for more than 10 days during such period, such\nlessee need not obtain a permit if a permit has been issued to the\nowner. (c) Where an owner has\nsecured a permit for a vehicle, a lessee of such vehicle under a lease for an\nindefinite period of time is not required to obtain a permit unless the lease\nextends beyond 30 days. Where a lessee obtains the permit such permit is valid\nonly during the term of the lease. Example 1: If A, the owner of the motor vehicle, leases it to B for\na two-week period, either A or B may obtain the permit. If B obtains the\npermit, it is only valid for two weeks. Example 2: If C rents a motor vehicle to D on a trip-lease basis, C\nshould obtain the permit. However, D may obtain the permit, in which event such\npermit is only valid for the one trip. Example 3: If E leases a motor vehicle from F under a lease or\nagreement giving him direct control thereof for a period of six months, E must\nobtain the permit even though a permit had previously been issued to\nF. (d) A lessee is deemed to\nhave direct control of a motor vehicle if he is actually in control of the\noperation of the vehicle. A lessee is generally in control of the operations\nwhere an employer-employee relationship exists between the lessee and the\ndriver of the vehicle. (e) The\nfollowing are some tests for determining whether an employer-employee\nrelationship exists: (1)\n\nThe lessee has the\nright to hire and discharge the driver. (2)\n\nThe lessee pays the driver's wages and\nfurther pays all State and Federal unemployment insurance taxes, old age\npensions, social security taxes, and provides workers' compensation\ncoverage. (3)\n\nThe lessee has the\nright to supervise the driver and direct the manner of his operation of the\nmotor vehicle. (f) Such\nsupervision and direction over the driver exists where the lessee has the right\nto control the driver in some or all of the following respects: (1)\nrequiring physical examination of the\ndriver; (2)\nrequiring the driver to\nkeep logs and file daily reports; (3)\nrequiring the driver to submit\nexplanations of delay and details of expense; (4)\nrequiring the driver to observe the\nstatutes and regulations of the various commissions, such as the Interstate\n\nCommerce Commission and the State Department of Transportation; (5)\nsupervision over the hours of\nwork; (6)\ninspection and\nmaintenance of equipment; (7)\nsupervision over the methods of handling shipments, if any; (8)\nchecking the time of the driver; and/or\n(9)\nprescribing schedules\nand routes to be followed and the speed at which the motor vehicle is to be\ndriven. (g) Where a\nlessee merely has the right to instruct the driver with respect to the\ndestination of the motor vehicle, the lessee would not generally be considered\nto have the right of direction and supervision over the driver. (h) It should be observed that an\nemployer-employee relationship may exist where the lessee has the right to\nexercise supervision and direction over the driver of the motor vehicle, even\nthough he may not exercise that right. Example: A leases a motor vehicle for more than 30 days from B\nunder an agreement providing that B is to furnish a driver who will be paid by\nA and who is subject to supervision by A. Although A has the right to supervise\nthe driver's operation of the motor vehicle, at times the driver selects his\nown routes and his own hours of driving. A nevertheless has direct control of\nthe motor vehicle. (i) The\nforegoing tests for determining direct control also apply to a motor vehicle\nleased from an owner-operator who reserves the right to either drive the motor\nvehicle himself or hires others to drive it. Thus, an owner-operator or a\ndriver hired by him may be an employee of the lessee depending upon the\nlessee's right of control over the driver. However, when the lessee's control\nin such a case relates only to instructions as to the destination of the motor\nvehicle and the owner-operator retains control of the driver and the details of\nthe driver's performance, the owner-operator may be deemed to have direct\ncontrol, requiring him to obtain the permit. (j) The application of the above provisions\nwill necessarily result in borderline cases. Whether the degree of control\nnecessary to establish an employer-employee relationship is present in any\ngiven case will depend upon the particular facts. Example 1: A leases a motor vehicle from B without a driver for more\nthan 30 consecutive days. A has direct control of the motor vehicle and must\nobtain the permit. Example 2: C leases a motor vehicle from D for more than 30\nconsecutive days, and the motor vehicle is operated by an employee of C\nselected by C and carried on C's payroll. D agrees to reimburse C for wages\npaid. C has direct control of the motor vehicle and must obtain the\npermit. Example 3: E leases a motor vehicle from F for more than 30\nconsecutive days and it is registered in E's name. F drives the motor vehicle\nas an employee of E and is carried on E's payroll. E has direct control of the\nmotor vehicle and must obtain the permit. Example 4: G enters into an agreement with H to deliver its\nproducts. G merely indicates to H where deliveries are to be made. G is not in\ndirect control of the motor vehicle operated by H. H therefore must obtain the\npermit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
