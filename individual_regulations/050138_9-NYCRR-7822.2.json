Tit. 9 § 7822.2 - Calculation procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For\nexisting buildings for which a comprehensive lighting energy analysis was\nconducted prior to September 1, 1980, the building lighting power budget and\nbuilding lighting load shall be the figures calculated in the course of such\ncomprehensive lighting energy analysis. (b) For all other existing buildings, the\nbuilding lighting power budget and the building lighting load shall be\ncalculated in accordance with the following procedures: (1)\ncalculate the building lighting power\nbudget by summing the lighting power budgets determined for each space in the\nexisting building, and multiplying this sum by 1.1. The lighting power budget\nfor each space shall be calculated in accordance with the following procedure: (i) determine the primary space use, and\nselect the appropriate space use factor from the Space Use Table contained in\nsubdivision (c) of this section (Table 1.1). Do not calculate a lighting power\nbudget for any space which is not listed in the Space Use Table; (ii)\ndetermine the predominant type of\nfixture in the space, other than specialized lighting fixtures. Select a\nfixture factor of either 1.0 if the predominant type of fixture uses\nfluorescent lamps, or 1.4 if the predominant type of fixture uses incandescent\nor mercury vapor lamps. When a space contains only specialized lighting\nfixtures, do not calculate a lighting power budget for such space; (iii)\ndetermine length, width, and area of\nthe space, and the fixture height (the distance between the bottom of the\nfixture and the floor); (iv)\nselect\nthe lighting power density corresponding to the length and width of the space\nand the fixture height from the Space Power Table contained in subdivision (d)\nof this section (Table 1.2); and\n(v) multiply the space use factor selected\nunder subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, times the fixture factor selected\nunder subparagraph (ii), times the area determined under subparagraph (iii), times the lighting power density selected under subparagraph (iv). The product\nis the lighting power budget for that space; and\n(2)\ncalculate the building lighting load by\nsumming the lighting load for each space for which a lighting power budget has\nbeen calculated. The lighting load for each space shall be calculated by\nsumming the wattage of all lamps installed in permanently mounted fixtures in\nsuch space, other than specialized lighting fixtures. The lighting load shall\ninclude the ballast loss for fluorescent and mercury vapor\nfixtures. (c) TABLE\n1.1-SPACE USE TABLE. SPACE USE SPACE USE\nFACTOR\nA. General Building Spaces\n1.
