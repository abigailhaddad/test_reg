Sections 316 and 318 of the model version of\nUIFSA contain specific provisions that allow a tribunal to receive evidence\nfrom another State and to obtain discovery through a tribunal of another\n\nState. When a jurisdiction receives a CSE\nTransmittal #3-Request for Assistance/Discovery from another jurisdiction, it\nshould not open a IV-D case; it should only provide the limited assistance\nrequested. By contrast, the CSE Transmittal #1-Initial Request is designed for\nuse when the initiating State is requesting the responding State to open a IV-D\ncase. Note that under current Federal policy, a\n\nState is not required to provide assistance requested via a CSE Transmittal #3. However, a State may choose to provide such assistance, particularly in the\ninterest of avoiding an interstate referral that would require the State to\nwork the whole case. HEADING/CAPTION (Pages 1 & 2): The\njurisdiction requesting assistance determines the heading. Note that the\nheading appears on both page 1 of the Child Support Enforcement Transmittal #3\nand on page 2, the Acknowledgment page. Identify the petitioner and respondent in\nthe appropriate spaces. Include full name and Social Security Numbers for both\nparties. Include a verified address for the respondent. Check the appropriate space to identify\nthe type of case: IV-D Non Public Assistance; IV-D Non Public Assistance\n\nMedicaid (indicate whether receiving Full Services or Medical Services Only); IV-D Public Assistance; IV-E Foster Care; or Non IV-D. IV-D means the case is\nbeing worked by the State or local child support enforcement agency (i.e., IV-D\nagency). Public Assistance means the obligee's family receives IV-A cash\npayments [IV-A was formerly called Aid to Families with Dependent Children\n(AAFDC) and is now called Temporary Family Assistance]. A IV-D Non Public\n\nAssistance Medicaid case is a case where the obligee's family receives Medicaid\nbut does not receive Public Assistance (IV-A cash payments). In the space marked \"To:\", list the name\nand address (street, city, State, and zip code) of the agency or court where\nyou are sending the CSE Transmittal #3. In the appropriate spaces, if applicable\nand if known, enter the Responding jurisdiction's FIPS code, State, IV-D case\nnumber, and docket number. Under \"docket number\", you may enter the docket\nnumber, cause number, or any other appropriate reference number that the\nresponding State may use to identify the case, if known. The \"responding\"\njurisdiction is the jurisdiction that receives the request for\nassistance. In the space marked \"From:\", list a\ncontact person, agency name, address (street, city, State, zip code), phone\nnumber (including extension), fax number, and Internet address. In the appropriate spaces, enter the\n\nInitiating jurisdiction's FIPS code, State, IV-D case number, and docket\nnumber. Under \"docket number\", you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other appropriate reference number which the initiating tribunal or\nagency has assigned to the case. The \"initiating\" jurisdiction is the\njurisdiction that is requesting assistance. ____________\nInstructions for Child Support Enforcement\n\nTransmittal #3-Request for Assistance/Discovery--Page 1\n\nCheck the appropriate box to indicate\nwhether the initiating jurisdiction uses the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of\n\nSupport Act (URESA) or the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act\n(UIFSA). In the designated space, note the State\nwhich you believe has continuing exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ), if known. Under\nUIFSA, a State that issues a child support order maintains CEJ as long as the\nobligor, obligee, or child(ren) reside in that State, or until each party files\nwritten consent allowing another State to assume CEJ. If there are multiple\norders governing the same obligor, obligee, and child(ren), UIFSA contains\nrules for determining which order is controlling. The tribunal that issued the\ncontrolling order has CEJ as long as the conditions for CEJ are met. CEJ means\nthe authority to modify the order. In the space marked \"Response Needed by\"\nenter the date by which a response is needed. SECTION I, ACTION: Check the appropriate\nbox(es) to indicate which actions are requested. Multiple actions may be\nrequested, as appropriate. Check item 1 \"Provide/Obtain Copies of\n\nDocumentation\" to request copies of documentation. Check appropriate box(es) to\nindicate the type of documentation: certified copies of orders, payment\nrecords, financial statement, or other (describe on blank line). In Section II\n\"Additional Information\", describe your request and provide background\ninformation necessary to identify the requested documents. If your are\nrequesting documents issued by a tribunal, contact the tribunal directly rather\nthan the IV-D agency. Check item 2 \"Provide Assistance with\n\nService of Process\" if you are requesting assistance with service of process. You may directly contact (via phone, fax, or other means) the sheriff, or other\nappropriate official, in another jurisdiction to request personal service of\nprocess. Send the Request for Assistance/Discovery only if such attempts have\nbeen unsuccessful. Check item 3 \"Provide Assistance with\n\nGenetic Testing\" if you are requesting assistance with genetic testing. Include\nin section II or attach any necessary information or materials, including names\nof genetic testing laboratories, protocols to be followed, testing kits, etc. Check item 4 \"Obtain Answers for\n\nInterrogatories\" if you are requesting completion of interrogatories. Attach\nthe interrogatories. Check item 5 \"Provide Assistance with\n\nTeleconference for Hearing or Deposition\" if you are requesting assistance in\nscheduling a teleconference for a hearing or deposition. Attach copy of hearing\nnotice or deposition. Check item 6 \"Obtain Financial Data/Proof\nof Respondent's Income\" if you are requesting financial data or proof of the\nrespondent's income. Explain your request in Section II or an\nattachment. Check item 7 \"Obtain Party Signature on\n\nAttached Form\" if you are requesting assistance in obtaining a signature. Attach forms which require signatures. Request assistance with obtaining a\nsignature only after you have attempted and failed to obtain the signature\nyourself. ____________\nInstructions for Child Support Enforcement\n\nTransmittal #3-Request for Assistance/Discovery--Page 2\n\nCheck item 8 \"Other\" if the reason you are\nrequesting assistance or discovery is not listed above. On the blank line, indicate the assistance needed; be as specific as possible. If you are requesting only \"quick locate\", do not use this form. Instead, use the Locate Data Sheet, or CSENet if you are\nusing an electronic format. If you are requesting that the tribunal in\nthe other State compel a person over whom it has jurisdiction to respond to a\ndiscovery order issued by a tribunal of another State (in accordance with\nsection 318 of the model version of UIFSA), attach certified copies of the\ndiscovery order. SECTION II, ADDITIONAL INFORMATION: In a\nnarrative format, indicate any other information that will be useful in\nprocessing your request. Provide any necessary identifying information and\nbackground information about why the request is being made, including: (1)\ninformation on the nature of the pending action (e.g., paternity, support, modification, enforcement, etc.) and (2) the reason assistance for the other\njurisdiction is needed. At the bottom of page 1, provide a\nspecific worker's name, a direct telephone number (with extension if necessary)\nand fax number to expedite communications between jurisdictions. PAGE 2, ACKNOWLEDGMENT: Upon receiving a\nrequest for assistance on a CSE Transmittal #3, the receiving State completes\nthe Acknowledgments section on page 2. The Acknowledgment can be used to\nprovide information in response to a request received via the CSE Transmittal\n#3, or to indicate when (how may days or on what date) the requested\ninformation/action will be provided. The jurisdiction sending the\n\nAcknowledgment should indicate where the case has been referred for action, and\nthe name, telephone and fax number of a contact person. **************************************************\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis information collection is conducted\nin accordance with\n45 CFR\n303.7\nof the child support enforcement\nprogram.
