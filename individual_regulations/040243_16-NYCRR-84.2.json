  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 84.2 - Long-range right-of-way management plan for electric transmission systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each member\nsystem of the New York Power Pool, except the Power Authority of the State of\n\nNew York, shall, by March 31, 1981, submit for review and approval by the New\n\nYork State Public Service Commission a long-range right-of-way (ROW) management\nplan for each respective electric transmission system comprised of transmission\nfacilities of 34 kv and above, except where located entirely on public streets\nor roads. The plan, shall, at a minimum, describe each company's structure and\norganization for ROW management planning and program operation. The plan, with\nappropriate maps, charts and text, shall describe the ROW system in general\nterms, its location, extent, components by voltage class, ROW widths and\ngeneral conditions. A statement shall be included explaining the rationale for\nselecting the time frame which the plan encompasses. (b) The plan shall describe the functions of\nkey positions in ROW management, including provisions and responsibilities for\nestablishing and achieving long-range ROW management goals and annual\nright-of-way maintenance objectives. (c) The plan should include a brief history\nof past and present ROW management policies and practices that would influence\nfuture management policies and practices. The management issues that the plan\nwill address should be discussed along with the plan's goals and objectives\nthat are established as a response to the issues. (d) The plan should describe landowner or\nland-user notification procedures and restrictions concerning company ROW\nmanagement plans and practices. The utilities should explain how they receive\nand handle restrictions and requests which modify management practices and\nprocedures, especially those involving chemical treatments. Procedures for\nidentifying, evaluating, reporting and responding to ROW maintenance problems\nshould be described. Determinations of appropriate ROW treatments and\nmaintenance schedules or cycles should be described, showing their relationship\nto long-range management goals and more immediate program objectives for both\nthe ROW's as a whole and vegetation in particular. (e) The plan should list the various ROW\nmanagement techniques used by the utility and the conditions under which a\ngiven mechanical, chemical or other technique is normally considered\nappropriate. There should be a discussion of the clearance standards sought, costs, effectiveness, environmental impacts, and other relevant concerns\nassociated with use of the techniques. For chemical treatments the section\nshould also include a discussion of combinations of treatment methods and\nmaterials, follow-up treatments, and the influence of accessibility, vegetation\ndensity, type and height, and other physical factors not described\nelsewhere. (f) The approach to\npreparation of annual maintenance plans and schedules for individual ROW's and\nthe steps to implement them to achieve the long-range plan goals should be\ndiscussed. The approaches that are used to determine work force size, type\n(e.g., company versus contractor) and capability, equipment and materials, and\na description of training needs, budgets, specifications for treatments, and\nmethods of program monitoring and evaluation should be included. Examples of\nforms, reports, records, etc., particularly those for cost accounting, should\nbe provided in the plan or in appendices. (g) The plan should contain a summary of\nthose ROW management issues that have not yet been resolved and which are\nincluded in present or anticipated research activities involving ROW\nmaintenance. Areas of any needed research which have not been undertaken should\nbe briefly described. (h) A\ndiscussion of regulations, licensing and permits should identify any needs\nthere are for such authorizations to conduct ROW management\noperations. (i) The plan should\ndescribe approximate funding levels that are needed to accomplish annual and\nmulti-year ROW management planning goals. Any strategies involving significant\nincreases in annual or multi-year funding levels that are deemed necessary to\nadvance the achievement of plan goals should be included. (j) The final section should describe\nprovisions for periodically reviewing, evaluating and revising the long-range\nplan, and the time interval for such revisions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n84.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
