  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 246.9 - Missing data procedures and out of control periods for continuous monitoring systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Whenever any\nmonitoring system fails to meet the quality-assurance and quality-control\nrequirements or data validation requirements of 40 CFR part\n75, data shall be\nsubstituted using the applicable missing data procedures in 40 CFR\n75\nsubpart\nD. (b) Audit decertification. Whenever both an audit of a monitoring system and a review of the initial\ncertification or recertification application reveal that any monitoring system\nshould not have been certified or recertified because it did not meet a\nparticular performance specification or other requirement under section\n246.8\nof this Part or the\napplicable provisions of 40 CFR part\n75, both at the time of the initial\ncertification or recertification application submission and at the time of the\naudit, the department will issue a notice of disapproval of the certification\nstatus of such monitoring system. For the purposes of this subdivision, an\naudit shall be either a field audit or an audit of any information submitted to\nthe department or the administrator. By issuing the notice of disapproval, the\ndepartment revokes prospectively the certification status of the monitoring\nsystem. The data measured and recorded by the monitoring system shall not be\nconsidered valid quality-assured data from the date of issuance of the\nnotification of the revoked certification status until the date and time that\nthe owner or operator completes subsequently approved initial certification or\nrecertification tests for the monitoring system. The owner or operator shall\nfollow the applicable initial certification or recertification procedures in\nthis section for each disapproved monitoring system. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n246.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
