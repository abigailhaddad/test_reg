  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1644-3.7 - Interest on State Housing Fund investments\n\nState Regulations\n\nInterest received by the State Comptroller on State\n\nHousing Fund investments (see Part 1645, Investments) will ordinarily be paid\ninto the State Housing Debt Fund and applied to the payment of interest on\nhousing bonds outstanding in the same manner as premiums received on the sale\nof bonds. The recording of interest on State Housing Debt Fund investments is\non a cash basis, that is, the interest earned is not periodically accrued, as\nis the case with interest on other investments, but the entry is made whenever\nthe local agency is notified by the division as to the amount of the interest\nreceived by the Comptroller. Upon receipt of such notice, a journal entry is\nmade charging account 1124, State Housing Debt Fund, with the amount of the\ninterest received by the Comptroller, and crediting the applicable development\ncost or operating income account, as described in Part 1645, Investments. As\nwith the premium on State housing bonds, the division will then notify the\nlocal agency, in advance of the date the local agency is called upon to remit\nthe interest on the bond issue for deposit in the State Housing Debt Fund, as\nto how much of the interest on State Housing Fund investments, if any, the\n\nComptroller intends to apply to the payment of the interest on the bonds and\nthe local agency will then remit the difference between the scheduled interest\nand the interest on State Housing Fund investments applied. The actual amount\nremitted will be paid in the manner previously described (see entry [1], §\n1644-3.5\nabove) and account 1124, State Housing Debt Fund, is charged. On the date the interest is due to be paid\nto the bondholders, entry (2) above (§\n1644-3.5\n) is made, charging the\nfull scheduled amount of the interest payment, before the deduction for the\ninterest on State Housing Fund investments applied, to the accrued interest\npayable account and crediting account 1124, State Housing Debt Fund. Note that\nthe amount of the quarterly accrual for the interest on the bonds, computed as\nper section\n1644-3.3, is not affected by either\nthe receipt or the application of the interest on State Housing Fund\ninvestments. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1644-3.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
