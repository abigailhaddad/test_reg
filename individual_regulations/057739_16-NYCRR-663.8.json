  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 663.8 - Work order system required\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\ncompany shall record all changes in telecommunications plant by means of a work\norder system which shall include a work order estimate and a work in progress\nrecord, and all installations, additions, retirements and replacements of\nretirement units (note the Retirement Units List at the end of this system of\naccounts) shall be covered thereby. Standing work orders (sometimes known as\nroutine estimates) may be used (1) by Class A companies, for plant changes of\nlike character whose estimated gross additions or retirements for an individual\nproject are less than $100,000, and (2) by Class B companies, for plant changes\nof like character whose estimated gross additions or retirements for an\nindividual project are less than $10,000. These limits may be modified by order\nof this commission, upon application, when warranted by particular\ncircumstances. Note: When work is to be done for which a work order\nestimate is not used and when part or all of the cost will be ultimately billed\nto others, the records shall be kept so that details of the costs, including an\nallowance for funds used during construction, can be readily ascertained. (This\ntype of order is commonly known as custom work order or keep cost order and\nshould be identified by a series of distinctive designations.)\n(b) The work order estimate shall\ninclude the following: (1)\nA designation\nnumber or letter and the signature of the officer or employee who authorized\nthe work, purchase or sale, and the date of such authorization. If the\nauthorization is by the board of directors or another body or committee, the\nproper officer shall so state over his signature. In case a new set of numbers\nis started at the beginning of each calendar or fiscal year, the designation\nshall identify each estimate so that it will not be confused with other\nestimates bearing the same number\n(2)\nA description and the location of the\nwork to be done (or the purchase, or retirement to be made) and the dates\nbetween which it is proposed to progress the project, the date when work was\nbegun and the date when completed. The date when any major portion or complete\nassembly is placed in or discontinued from service shall be shown consistently\neither in the work order estimate or in the work in progress record\n(3)\n\nDetailed estimates of the cost of the\nproject to be supported by maps, plans, diagrams, specifications, etc., applicable\n(4)\n\nThe account or\naccounts to which the cost of the project is to be distributed and retirements\ncredited, and the amount estimated for each such account\n(5)\n\nAny variations between estimates and the\nactual cost of the project\n(6)\n\nWhen\na project involves changes in existing telecommunications plant, the work order\nestimate or the work in progress record shall show the year or period of\ninstallation of the property retired or otherwise affected, and shall show or\nrefer to other records which cover the book cost (estimated if not known, with\nthe basis of the estimate stated) and the name and page of the accounting and\nengineering books and records covering such installation and the cost\nthereof\n(c) The work in\nprogress record shall contain the following: (1)\nA designation number or letter which\nshall correspond to the number or letter on the work order estimate covering\nthe same project. When more than one work in progress record covers the\nexpenditures on a work order estimate, each shall be numbered or lettered so as\nto be readily identifiable with the work order estimate for that\nproject\n(2)\n\nThe accumulated charges\nand credits applicable to each project, the total cost of the complete project, the cost of removal and value of salvage recovered shall be shown together with\nthe quantity of material installed or retired and, so far as practicable, the\nnumber of retirement units installed or retired. When any project involves\namounts distributable to more than one telecommunications plant or other\naccount, the work in progress record shall be kept so as to show the amount\napplicable to each account. Every charge or credit on a work in progress record\nshall be readily verifiable from detailed underlying sources. Indirect\nconstruction costs (see section\n663.3\n[b][13]\nof\nthis Part) shall be separately stated for each account by classes. Credits\nrepresenting contributions toward construction shall be recorded so as to show\nname of contributor and a distribution by plant accounts of the amount\nreceived. (Note section\n663.1\n[b]\nof this\n\nPart.)\n(d) Amounts on\nopen work orders shall support accounts 2003 and 2004, Telecommunications Plant\n\nUnder Construction--Short Term and Long Term respectively, and account 3100.01, Retirement Work In Progress, (note also account 3100, subdivision C), except\nthat standing work orders (routine estimates) may reflect expenditures on short\nterm construction or retirement projects which are not carried through those\naccounts. Upon coming into service, completed portions involving additions to\nplant accounts shall be transferred to appropriate accounts although other\nportions of the work covered by the same order are not yet completed and the\nwork order has not been closed. Maintenance costs initially charged to a work\norder shall be cleared monthly. When use of a retirement unit ceases, the book\ncost thereof, estimated if not known, shall be credited to the proper account\neven though the plant has not been actually dismantled. (Note also section\n663.5\nof this Part.)\n\nNote A:Requirement of the use of the work order system\nhere outlined may be suspended by order of this commission when a company\nsatisfies this commission that the procedure which it follows gives equivalent\ndetail of changes in telecommunications plant accounts in substantially the\nsame form and with the promptness which the accounting system contemplates. The\nidentification of expenditures with property must be completed and clear and\nthe detail of each project must be readily available\n\nNote B:The work order system is required to record\nchanges, both additions and retirements, in plant used wholly or partly, in\ntelecommunications operations. Its use is recommended, however, in recording\nother expenditures such as repairs and research projects, plant changes in\nother departments, and custom, construction or maintenance work for\nothers. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n663.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
