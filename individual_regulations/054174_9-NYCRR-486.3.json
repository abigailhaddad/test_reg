  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 486.3 - New york statewide police information network (nyspin) standards governing system access and information dissemination\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The NYSPIN Code of Ethics. (1)\n\nConflicts of interest. No member or\nemployee authorized to access information available via NYSPIN should have any\ninterest, financial or otherwise, direct or indirect, or engage in any business\nor transaction or professional activity or incur any obligation of any nature, which is in substantial conflict with the proper discharge of his duties\nassociated with accessing NYSPIN. (2)\n\nMembers and employees of an agency\nauthorized to access NYSPIN information should not: (i) accept any employment or engage in any\nbusiness or professional activity which will require them to disclose\nconfidential information they have gained through NYSPIN; (ii)\ndisclose confidential criminal justice\ninformation acquired by them in the course of their official duties, nor use\nsuch information to further their personal interests; (iii)\nuse or attempt to use the ability to\naccess NYSPIN to secure unwarranted privileges or exemptions for themselves or\nothers; or\n(iv)\nby their conduct, give reasonable basis for the impression that any person can improperly\ninfluence them or unduly enjoy their favor in the performance of their official\nduties associated with NYSPIN, or that they are affected by the kinship, rank, position or influence of any party or person. (b) The NYSPIN system is for official use\nonly and may only be used for criminal justice purposes. Messages of a private, personal or social nature are prohibited. Transmissions of judicial or other\nsubpoenae are prohibited. Death notification and funeral arrangement messages\nmay be sent if the following conditions are met: (1)\n\nDeath notification or funeral arrangement\nmessages may only be sent for active and retired criminal justice\nofficers. (2)\n\nGenerally, such\nmessages should be restricted to the region of origin, unless the message is of\nspecific interest to other areas of the State. (3)\n\nNotifications may not be sent outside New\n\nYork State except for police officers killed in the line of duty, in accord\nwith NLETS policy (part 1, section\n5.2\n). (4)\nA copy of all death\nnotification and funeral arrangement messages must be sent to SP Albany NY\n(QHQT). (c) Messages may\nonly be sent and inquiries may only be made on the authority of a member of an\nagency assigned an agency identifier (ORI). (d) Inquiries to NYSPIN may only be made for\ncriminal justice purposes. (e) No\nprinted material obtained via NYSPIN (or copies thereof) may be delivered to\npersons or agencies outside criminal justice except as directed by an\nappropriate court or other proper legal authority. Requests for printed\nmaterial (or copies thereof) pursuant to the Public Officers Law, article 6\n(the Freedom of Information Law) need not be delivered to persons or agencies\noutside criminal justice if exemptions listed under section 87, subdivision\n2(a-i) of such law apply. If you have any doubt that the Freedom of Information\n\nLaw request is valid, assistance is available from the New York State Police, Records Access Officer (Assistant Deputy Superintendent--Administration), Building 22, State Campus, Albany, NY 12226. (f) All requests for information stored in\nthe NYSPIN computer, the NYSPIN Operating Manual, interim NYSPIN Operating\n\nManual revisions, and NYSPIN operational aids pursuant to the Public Officers\n\nLaw, article 6 (the Freedom of Information Law) must be referred, in writing, to the Superintendent of State Police. All requests for CHRI under either the\n\nFreedom of Information Law or the Public Officers Law, article 6-A (Personal\n\nPrivacy Protection Law), must be referred to the commissioner of\nDCJS. (g) It is recognized that in\nthe normal course of official duty it may become necessary to lawfully\ndisseminate information (other than CHRI) received from NYSPIN to persons or\nagencies not associated with the administration of criminal justice, including\nprivate citizens. In all instances, such dissemination must be secondary\ndissemination from an official agency report or record, including blotter\nentries but not printed material (or copies thereof), as described in\nsubdivision (e) of this section. Some examples of authorized secondary\ndissemination include, but are not limited to: (1)\nrelease of registrant information\nobtained from NYSPIN to a towing company when a vehicle was impounded at police\nrequest; (2)\nrelease of operator or\nregistrant information obtained via NYSPIN from an MV-104 police accident\nreport; and\n(3)\nthe release to\nhospital officials of information relating to insurance company information\nobtained via NYSPIN. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that any information\nobtained from NYSPIN, but disseminated outside criminal justice, comes from an\nofficial report or record to prevent unauthorized persons from accessing\ncriminal justice information by means of fraud or deceit. (h) All operating instructions\ndescribed in the official NYSPIN Operating Manual published by the Division of\n\nState Police must be followed. Messages must be originated in the form\ndescribed therein, and should be as brief as possible. Requirements for message\nconstruction are waived for those instances when only an entry or update to the\ncomputer is made and there is no need for other users to receive copies of the\nmessage. (i) All agencies on the\nsystem shall accept without charge message and inquiry requests from members of\nother authorized criminal justice agencies. (j) Sale of information or receiving a\nbenefit for information received via NYSPIN is prohibited and may constitute\nofficial misconduct or other crimes. Dissemination of criminal justice\ninformation obtained via NYSPIN to unauthorized persons or agencies that may\nuse such information commercially, such as private investigators, process\nservers, bail bondsmen or their agents, and private security agencies is\nstrictly prohibited. (k) All NYSPIN\nand non-NYSPIN participants must enter into a use and dissemination agreement\nwith the Division of State Police certifying that all agency employees\nauthorized to access information available from NYSPIN will comply with NYSPIN\nrules and operating instructions governing the use and dissemination of\ninformation obtained from the system. (l) All news releases relating to the NYSPIN\nsystem, including those of a local level, must be approved in advance by the\n\nDivision of State Police. (m) NYSPIN participants must establish procedures for appropriate training and\ncertification of NYSPIN operators as described in the NYSPIN Operating Manual. Only certified operators may operate the terminal device. Operators must be\nlimited to members or specific employees of the agency who are designated to\nsupport members using NYSPIN. (n) Positive NYSPIN, DCJS and NCIC responses, as well as messages from NYSPIN\nparticipants, could be used as information relevant to the arrest of a person\nwho has committed or is committing an offense. Criminal Procedure Law\nprovisions defining \"reasonable cause\" and \"arrest without a warrant\" always\napply to NYSPIN information. Information obtained through NYSPIN must be\nindependently evaluated to determine what, if any, action is authorized based\nthereon. To prevent the unnecessary detention or false arrest of innocent\nparties, both NYSPIN and non-NYSPIN participants must establish minimum\ntraining standards for their criminal justice employees who ultimately use the\ninformation obtained from the NYSPIN system. (o) NYSPIN assumes no responsibility for the\nunlawful or unauthorized use of information derived from the system. (p) When property that was reported stolen\nand subsequently entered into NYSPIN or NCIC is recovered, the agency\nrecovering the property must, before the property is released, confirm removal\nof the record by means of an inquiry, regardless of any correspondence received\nfrom the originator of the record. This will help to prevent the unnecessary\ndetention or arrest of an innocent person. (q) Whenever an agency receives a positive\nresponse to an inquiry and the person or property is identical to the positive\nresponse and the originating agency confirms the property is stolen or the\nperson is wanted or missing, a locate message must be transmitted. (r) If an agency is not staffed 24 hours a\nday, it must have in place suitable arrangements for \"hit\" confirmation\ndescribed in the NYSPIN Operating Manual if records are entered on the NYSPIN, NCIC or DCJS files. Contact the NYSPIN staff at 1-800-372-3675 for suggested\nways to provide 24-hour \"hit\" confirmation. (s) The NYSPIN Operating Manual contains\ninformation, procedures and instructions which are required to access the\nNYSPIN computer. To prevent unauthorized electronic access to NYSPIN or\nsabotage to the system or files, the NYSPIN Operating Manual, with the\nexception of this Part (rule), is considered to be confidential and is not a\npublic record. No part of the NYSPIN Operating Manual may be reproduced without\nthe express written authorization of the Superintendent of State Police. All\nrequests for copies of the manual must be made by subpoena duces tecum served\nupon the Superintendent of State Police, Building 22, State Campus, Albany, NY\n12226. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
