A chart, table or mathematical\ncalculation presented to demonstrate possible results based upon a combination of variables (such as multiples of price and quantity to reflect gross\nsales) is an earnings claim subject to this item. An earnings claim limited solely to the actual operating results of a specific unit being offered\nfor sale need not comply with this Item if it is given only to potential purchasers of that unit and is accompanied by the name and last known\naddress of each owner of the unit during the prior three years. ii. Supplemental earnings claim: If a\nfranchisor has made an earnings claim in accordance with this Item, the franchisor may deliver to a prospective franchisee a supplemental earnings\nclaim directed to a particular location or circumstance, apart from the offering circular. The supplemental earnings claim must be in writing, explain the departure from the earnings claim in the offering circular, be prepared in accordance with this Item, and be left with the prospective\nfranchisee. iii.

An earnings\nclaim shall include a description of its factual basis and the material assumptions underlying its preparation and presentation. These shall include, but not be limited to, the data, methods and computations on which any estimated or projected earnings claim is based. i. Factual Basis: The factual basis of an earnings claim includes significant matters upon which a franchisee's\nfuture results are expected to depend. This includes, for example, economic or market conditions which are basic to a franchisee's operation, and\nencompasses matters affecting or likely to affect, among other things, a franchisee's sales, the cost of goods or services sold and operating\nexpenses. In the absence of an adequate operating experience of its own, a franchisor may base an earnings claim upon the results of operations of a\nsubstantially similar business of a person affiliated with the franchisor, or franchisees of that person, provided that disclosure is made of any\nmaterial differences in the economic or market conditions known to, or reasonably ascertainable by, the franchisor. ii. Basic Disclosures: The earnings claim must set forth: (a) Material\nassumptions, other than matters of common knowledge, underlying the claim; (b) Whether or not it is based\non the actual experience of franchised units.

Additionally, the affiliated company must file with the Secretary of State a consent to service of process in New York State. C. Consolidated and separate statements: i. A franchisor's financial statements\nshall be integrated with that of its subsidiaries to reflect the companies' consolidated financial condition. ii.
