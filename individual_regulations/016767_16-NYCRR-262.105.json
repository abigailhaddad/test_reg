  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 262.105 - Drug tests required\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach operator shall conduct the following drug tests for\nthe presence of a prohibited drug: (a) Pre-employment testing. No operator may hire or contract for the use of any\nperson as an employee unless that person passes a drug test or is covered by an\nanti-drug program that conforms to the requirements of this Part. (b) Post-accident test. As soon as possible\nbut no later than 32 hours after an accident, an operator shall drug test each\nemployee whose performance either contributed to the accident or cannot be\ncompletely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. An operator may\ndecide not to test under this paragraph but such a decision must be based on\nthe best information available immediately after the accident that the\nemployee's performance could not have contributed to the accident or that, because of the time between that performance and the accident, it is not likely\nthat a drug test would reveal whether the performance was affected by drug\nuse. (c) Random testing. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraphs (2)\nthrough (4) of this subdivision, the minimum annual percentage rate for random\ndrug testing shall be 50 percent of covered employees. (2)\n\nThe administrator's decision to increase\nor decrease the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is based\non the reported positive rate for the entire industry. All information used for\nthis determination is drawn from the drug Management Information System (MIS)\nreports required by part\n199\nof title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations (\n49\nCFR\n). In order to ensure reliability of the data, the administrator considers\nthe quality and completeness of the reported data, may obtain additional\ninformation or reports from operators, and may make appropriate modifications\nin calculating the industry positive rate. Each year, the administrator will\npublish in the Federal Register the minimum annual percentage rate for random\ndrug testing of covered employees. The new minimum annual percentage rate for\nrandom drug testing will be applicable starting January 1st of the calendar\nyear following publication. (3)\n\nWhen the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 50 percent, the administrator may lower this rate to 25 percent of all covered employees if\nthe administrator determines that the data received under the reporting\nrequirements of\n199.119\nof title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations (\n49 CFR\n)\nfor two consecutive calendar years indicate that the reported positive rate is\nless than 1.0 percent. (4)\n\nWhen the\nminimum annual percentage rate for random drug testing is 25 percent, and the\ndata received under the reporting requirements of\nsection\n199.119\nof title 49 of the Code of Federal\n\nRegulations (\n49 CFR\n) for any calendar year indicate that the\nreported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent, the\nadministrator will increase the minimum annual percentage rate for random drug\ntesting to 50 percent of all covered employees. (5)\n\nThe selection of employees for random\ndrug testing shall be made by a scientifically valid method, such as a random\nnumber table or a computer-based random number generator that is matched with\nemployees' Social Security numbers, payroll identification numbers, or other\ncomparable identifying numbers. Under the selection process used, each covered\nemployee shall have an equal chance of being tested each time selections are\nmade. (6)\n\nThe operator shall\nrandomly select a sufficient number of covered employees for testing during\neach calendar year to equal an annual rate not less that the minimum annual\npercentage rate for random drug testing determined by the administrator. If the\noperator conducts random drug testing through a consortium, the number of\nemployees to be tested may be calculated for each individual operator or may be\nbased on the total number of covered employees covered by the consortium who\nare subject to random drug testing at the same minimum annual percentage rate\nunder this Part or any DOT drug testing rule. (7)\n\nEach operator shall ensure that random\ndrug tests conducted under this Part are unannounced and that the dates for\nadministering random tests are spread reasonably throughout the calendar\nyear. (8)\n\nIf a given covered\nemployee is subject to random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more\nthan one DOT agency for the same operator, the employee shall be subject to\nrandom drug testing at the percentage rate established for the calendar year by\nthe DOT agency regulating more than 50 percent of the employee's\nfunction. (9)\n\nIf an operator is\nrequired to conduct random drug testing under the drug testing rules of more\nthan one DOT agency, the operator may: (i) establish separate pools for random selection, with each pool containing the\ncovered employees who are subject to testing at the same required rate; or\n(ii)\nrandomly select such\nemployees for testing at the highest percentage rate established for the\ncalendar year by any DOT agency to which the operator is subject. (d) Testing based on\nreasonable cause. Each operator shall drug test each employee when there is\nreasonable cause to believe the employee is using a prohibited drug. The\ndecision to test must be based on a reasonable and articulable belief that the\nemployee is using a prohibited drug on the basis of specific, contemporaneous\nphysical, behavioral, or performance indicators of probable drug use. At least\ntwo of the employee's supervisors, one of whom is trained in detection of the\npossible symptoms of drug use, shall substantiate and concur in the decision to\ntest an employee. The concurrence between the two supervisors may be by\ntelephone. However, in the case of operators with 50 or fewer employees subject\nto testing under this Part, only one supervisor of the employee trained in\ndetecting possible drug use symptoms shall substantiate the decision to\ntest. (e) Return to duty testing. A\ncovered employee who refuses to take or has a positive drug test may not return\nto duty in the covered function until the covered employee has complied with\napplicable provisions of DOT procedures concerning substance abuse professional\nand return-to-duty process. (f) Follow-up testing. A covered employee who refuses to take or has a positive\ndrug test shall be subject to unannounced follow-up drug tests administered by\nthe operator following the covered employee's return to duty. The number and\nfrequency of such follow-up testing shall be determined by a substance abuse\nprofessional, but shall consist of at least six tests in the first 12 months\nfollowing the covered employee's return to duty. In addition, follow-up testing\nmay include testing for alcohol as directed by the substance abuse\nprofessional, to be performed in accordance with 49 CFR part\n40. Follow-up\ntesting shall not exceed 60 months from the date of the covered employee's\nreturn to duty. The substance abuse professional may terminate the requirement\nfor follow-up testing at any time after the first six tests have been\nadministered, if the substance abuse professional determines that such testing\nis no longer necessary.
