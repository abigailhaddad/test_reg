  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1262.45 - Grounding and bonding of tank and refueling service vehicles required\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All tank\nvehicles and refueling service vehicles shall be fitted with means of bonding\nand grounding. The maximum resistance of any static grounding or bonding\ncircuit (bounding clips through the grounding cable, reels and chassis to the\nground point) shall not exceed 100 ohms. Prior to any transfer and during\nrefueling or defueling of aircraft, the fueling dispensing hose, nozzle, tank\nvehicle and the aircraft shall be bonded and grounded to a point or points of\nzero electrical potential, (the electrical potential of the earth in the\nvicinity of aircraft and fuel tank vehicle). Bonding of an underwing refueling\nnozzle to the aircraft is not required when a metal to metal clamping contact\nbetween the nozzle and the filler connection is affected. (b) Grounding will be accomplished by\nattaching the ground conductor, on the tank vehicle and refueling vehicle, to a\nproper grounding rod and to the aircraft by use of either a \"Y\" connection or\nsecond grounding cable device. (c) Bonding the aircraft and the dispensing nozzle or coupler connection by use of\nthe clamp and bonding wire device attached to the nozzle prior to opening the\naircraft tank and disconnecting after the aircraft tank is filled and the\nfiller opening is closed. Underwing nozzles only require bonding devices when\nof insulated construction preventing a firm metal to metal\ncontact. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n1262.45\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
