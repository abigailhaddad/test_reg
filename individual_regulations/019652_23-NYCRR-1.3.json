  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 23 § 1.3 - Disclosures for debts in which the statute of limitations may be expired\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A debt\ncollector must maintain reasonable procedures for determining the statute of\nlimitations applicable to a debt it is collecting and whether such statute of\nlimitations has expired. (b) If a\ndebt collector knows or has reason to know that the statute of limitations for\na debt may be expired, before accepting payment on the debt, the debt collector\nmust provide the consumer with clear and conspicuous notice, in the same medium\n(such as via telephone or electronic communication) by which the debt collector\nwill accept payment, that: (1)\nthe debt\ncollector believes that the statute of limitations applicable to the debt may\nbe expired; (2)\nsuing on a debt for\nwhich the statute of limitations has expired is a violation of the Fair Debt\n\nCollection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. section\n1692\net seq.; (3)\nif the consumer is sued on a debt for\nwhich the statute of limitations has expired, the consumer may be able to stop\nthe lawsuit by responding to the court that the statute of limitations has\nexpired; (4)\nthe consumer is not\nrequired to provide the debt collector with an admission, affirmation, or\nacknowledgment of the debt, a promise to pay the debt, or a waiver of the\nstatute of limitations; and\n(5)\nif\nthe consumer makes any payment on a debt for which the statute of limitations\nhas expired or admits, affirms, acknowledges, or promises to pay such debt, the\nstatute of limitations may restart. (c) The following language satisfies the\nnotice requirement contained in section\n1.3\n(b) of this\n\nPart: \"We are required by regulation of the New York State\n\nDepartment of Financial Services to notify you of the following information. This information is NOT legal advice: Your creditor or debt collector believes that the legal time\nlimit (statute of limitations) for suing you to collect this debt may have\nexpired. It is a violation of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. §\n1692\net seq., to sue to collect on a debt for\nwhich the statute of limitations has expired. However, if the creditor sues you\nto collect on this debt, you may be able to prevent the creditor from obtaining\na judgment against you. To do so, you must tell the court that the statute of\nlimitations has expired. Even if the statute of limitations has expired, you may\nchoose to make payments on the debt. However, be aware: if you make a payment\non the debt, admit to owing the debt, promise to pay the debt, or waive the\nstatute of limitations on the debt, the time period in which the debt is\nenforceable in court may start again. If you would like to learn more about your legal rights and\noptions, you can consult an attorney or a legal assistance or legal aid\norganization.\"\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
