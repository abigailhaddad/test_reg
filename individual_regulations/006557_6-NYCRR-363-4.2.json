  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-4.2 - Engineering drawings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Maps\nand drawings. Maps and drawings using the following format and containing the\nfollowing information must be submitted: (1)\na regional map that provides the location of the facility and the location of\nand distance to any airports located within six miles of the\nfacility; (2)\na vicinity map that\ndelineates zoning and land use, communities of disproportionate impact, residences, principal aquifers, primary aquifers, surface waters, access roads, and other existing and proposed features on the facility and within one mile of\nthe facility; and a wind rose identifying the prevailing wind direction based\non the nearest local source of meteorological data; and\n(3)\na site plan and drawings of the facility\nthat show: (i) property boundaries; (ii)\noff-site and on-site utilities, including electric, gas, stormwater and sanitary systems; (iii)\nright-of-way easements including noise\neasements; (iv)\nthe names and\naddresses of contiguous property owners; (v) the location of soil borings, excavations, test pits, gas venting structures, wells, piezometers, environmental and facility monitoring points and devices, benchmarks and\npermanent survey markers. With the exception of benchmarks and permanent survey\nmarkers, each location must be identified in accordance with a numbering system\nacceptable to the department. All horizontal locations must be accurate to the\nnearest tenth of a foot and all vertical locations must be accurate to the\nnearest 100th of a foot as measured from the ground surface and top of well\ncasing; (vi)\na delineation of the\ntotal facility area, including planned staged development of the landfill's\nconstruction and operation, and the lateral and vertical limits of previously\nfilled areas (if applicable); (vii)\nthe location and identification of on-site sources of cover\nmaterials; (viii)\nthe location and\nidentification of special waste (such as, alternative operating cover materials\nor select fills) handling areas; (ix)\non-site buildings, leachate storage and\nconveyance systems, landfill gas management system components, roads, and\nparking areas; and\n(x) site\ntopography with five-foot minimum contour intervals. (b) Engineering drawings of the\nlandfill in both plan and cross-sectional views, depicting: how the facility\nwill be constructed, operated and closed; areas of potential environmental\nimpact; and the ability of the design, construction, operation, and closure of\nthe facility to comply with the applicable requirements of this Part. If the\nlandfill is to be constructed in stages, the initial permit application must\ncontain the conceptual design for the entire landfill and the detailed\nconstruction drawings for the initial stage to be constructed. The engineering\ndrawings must include, at a minimum: (1)\nthe\noriginal undeveloped site topography before excavation or placement of waste, if available; (2)\nthe existing site\ntopography (if different from the original undeveloped site topography)\nincluding the location and approximate thickness and nature of any existing\nwaste; (3)\nthe elevations of the\nknown or interpolated seasonal high groundwater table, and the wells from which\ndata were taken to establish the seasonal high groundwater table, using a\n100-foot square grid, including surface elevation, bedrock elevation, depth to\nbedrock, and groundwater flow direction at each well; (4)\nthe known and interpolated bedrock\nelevations, the upper and lower limits of any confining overburden deposits, and all boreholes, test pits, wells, and other points used to supply this\ninformation using a 100-foot square grid; (5)\nthe proposed limits of excavation\ndelineating the base elevations of the liner and leachate collection and\nremoval system and pore pressure relief system if present, using a 100-foot\nsquare grid; (6)\nthe details for\nall components of the final cover and the final cover elevations for each\n100-foot square grid intersection; (7)\nthe details for all components of the\nliner system, anchor trenches and leachate collection and removal system, including all critical grades and elevations of collection pipe inverts and\ndrainage envelopes, manholes, cleanouts, valves, sumps, leachate flow control\nand metering devices, and drainage blanket thicknesses; (8)\nthe berms, dikes, ditches, drainage\nswales, culverts, sedimentation ponds, recharge basins and other devices used\nto divert, collect or control surface water run-on or run-off; (9)\nthe groundwater dewatering\nsystems; (10)\nthe landfill gas\nmanagement system used for collecting, treating, venting and monitoring the\ndecomposition gases generated within the landfill, including any active\nlandfill gas collection system components, including the condensate conveyance\nlines and storage facilities. Detailed plans of any active gas collection\nsystem must adequately delineate, in plan and in cross-sectional views, the\nlocation and grades of all landfill gas collection lines and landfill gas\ncontrol lines, locating and showing all critical elevations of the collection\npipe inverts, cleanouts, condensate knockout sumps, and valves. Layout of the\nsystem structure must be included, showing equipment locations; sampling\nlocations; on-site drainage structures; and extraction well location, depth of\nplacement, and construction materials; (11)\nthe location of groundwater monitoring\nwells; (12)\nthe location of\ngeophysical and geochemical monitoring devices or structures, if needed; (13)\nthe location of leachate\nstorage, treatment and disposal system including the leachate conveyance\nnetwork and secondary containment system required in section\n363-6.20\nof this Part; and\n(14)\nthe plans detailing the\nconstruction staging area if proposed, and facility entrance area including\ngates, fences and signs. (c) Operational drawings for the facility\ndepicted in plan and cross-sectional views, showing: (1)\ngeneralized fill progression drawings\ndepicting fill progression for the life of the facility, identifying the depth, location and sequence of fill progression, and including the elevation of the\nliners, leachate collection and removal system, landfill gas management system\nand projected final waste mass; (2)\ndetailed fill progression drawings depicting fill progression for the first\noperational phase, identifying the placement of waste including special waste\nareas, lift thickness, and compacted thickness of operating and final cover; landfill gas management system; and on-site roadways and traffic patterns; and\n(3)\na survey control drawing\ndepicting a method of survey baseline and elevation control and identifying the\nlocation and description of a permanent surveying benchmark and other critical\nfacility monitoring locations and appurtenances for each 25 acres of the\ndeveloped facility.
