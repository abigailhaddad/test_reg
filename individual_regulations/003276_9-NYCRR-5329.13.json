After licensing of an operator, commission approval\nis required before such operator is permitted to offer any type of wager not\npreviously offered by such operator, or an existing wager type for a sport, league, association or organization on whose contests the commission has not\npreviously authorized wagering. To obtain commission approval, an operator\nshall specify the underlying sport and sports league, association or\norganization upon which the proposed type of wager is based, provide rules for\nthe wager and demonstrate that the new type of wager will comply with Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law section 1367 and this Part. Following\nreview of the proposed wager type, the commission shall inform all operators\nwhether the proposed wager type is approved or denied or whether additional\ninformation from such operator is required.

(c) Variations on wager types. An operator may introduce variations of permissible types\nof wagers by seeking commission approval. An operator is not required to amend\na previously approved submission to describe a variation if approved by the\ncommission. (d) Conditions placed on wager type. The commission may approve conditionally a wager type or\nthe use of a wager type for a particular sport, league, association or\norganization as the commission may deem advisable, such as establishing a\nlimited trial period for a type of wager or imposing limits on a particular\nwager, to protect the wagering public, the integrity of wagers, the integrity\nof the sports event upon which a wager is based, in whole or in part, or for\nany other reason consistent with the policies underlying article 13 of the\n\nRacing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law or this Title. (e) Withholding of approval. The commission may, in the exercise of discretion, withhold approval of any proposed wagering type that directly or indirectly\nviolates any requirement for permissible wagers or that the commission\ndetermines to be contrary to public policy.
