  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 617.6 - Initial review of actions and establishing lead agency\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Initial review of actions\n(1)\n\nAs early as possible in an agency's\nformulation of an action it proposes to undertake, or as soon as an agency\nreceives an application for funding or for approval of an action, it must do\nthe following: (i) Determine whether the\naction is subject to SEQR. If the action is a Type II action, the agency has no\nfurther responsibilities under this Part; (ii)\n\nDetermine whether the action involves a\nfederal agency. If the action involves a federal agency, the provisions of\nsection\n617.15\nof this Part apply; (iii)\n\nDetermine whether the action may involve one or more other agencies; and\n(iv)\n\nMake a preliminary\nclassification of an action as Type I or Unlisted, using the information\navailable and comparing it with the thresholds set forth in section\n617.4\nof this\n\nPart. Such preliminary classification will assist in determining whether a full\nEAF and coordinated review is necessary. (2)\n\nFor Type I actions, a full EAF (see\nsection\n617.20, Appendix A, of\nthis Part) must be used to determine the significance of such actions. The\nproject sponsor must complete Part 1 of the full EAF, including a list of all\nother involved agencies that the project sponsor has been able to identify, exercising all due diligence. The lead agency is responsible for preparing\nparts 2 and 3. (3)\n\nFor Unlisted\nactions, the short EAF (see section\n617.20, Appendix B, of\nthis Part) must be used to determine the significance of such actions. However, an agency may instead use the full EAF for Unlisted actions if the short EAF\nwould not provide the lead agency with sufficient information on which to base\nits determination of significance. The lead agency may require other\ninformation necessary to determine significance. (4)\n\nFor state agencies only, determine\nwhether the action is located in the coastal area. If the action is either Type\nI or Unlisted and is in the coastal area, the provisions of 19 NYCRR\n600\nalso\napply. This provision applies to all state agencies, whether acting as a lead\nor involved agency. (5)\n\nDetermine\nwhether the Type I or Unlisted action is located in an agricultural district\nand comply with the provisions of subdivision (4) of section 305 of article\n25-AA of the Agriculture and Markets Law, if applicable. (b) Establishing lead agency. (1)\n\nWhen a single agency is involved, that\nagency will be the lead agency when it proposes to undertake, fund or approve a\n\nType I or Unlisted action that does not involve another agency. (i) If the agency is directly undertaking the\naction, it must determine the significance of the action as early as possible\nin the design or formulation of the action. (ii)\n\nIf the agency has received an\napplication for funding or approval of the action, it must determine the\nsignificance of the action within 20 calendar days of its receipt of the\napplication, an EAF, or any additional information reasonably necessary to make\nthat determination, whichever is later. (2)\n\nWhen more than one agency is involved: (i) For all Type I actions and for\ncoordinated review of Unlisted actions involving more than one agency, a lead\nagency must be established prior to a determination of significance. For\n\nUnlisted actions where there will be no coordinated review, the procedures in\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision must be followed. (ii)\n\nWhen an agency has been established as\nthe lead agency for an action involving an applicant and has determined that an\nEIS is required, it must, in accordance with section\n617.12\n(b) of this Part, promptly notify the applicant and all other involved agencies, in\nwriting, that it is the lead agency, that an EIS is required and whether that\nscoping will be conducted. (iii)\n\nThe lead agency will continue in that role until it files either a negative\ndeclaration or a findings statement or a lead agency is re-established in\naccordance with paragraph (6) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nCoordinated review. (i) When an agency proposes to directly\nundertake, fund or approve a Type I action or an Unlisted action undergoing\ncoordinated review with other involved agencies, it must, as soon as possible, transmit Part 1 of the EAF completed by the project sponsor, or a draft EIS and\na copy of any application it has received to all involved agencies and notify\nthem that a lead agency must be agreed upon within 30 calendar days of the date\nthe EAF or draft EIS was transmitted to them. For the purposes of this Part, and unless otherwise specified by the department, all coordination and filings\nwith the department as an involved agency must be with the appropriate regional\noffice of the department. (ii)\n\nThe\nlead agency must determine the significance of the action within 20 calendar\ndays of its establishment as lead agency, or within 20 calendar days of its\nreceipt of all information it may reasonably need to make the determination of\nsignificance, whichever occurs later, and must immediately prepare, file and\npublish the determination in accordance with section\n617.12\nof this Part. (iii)\n\nIf a lead\nagency exercises due diligence in identifying all other involved agencies and\nprovides written notice of its determination of significance to the identified\ninvolved agencies, then no involved agency may later require the preparation of\nan EAF, a negative declaration or an EIS in connection with the action. The\ndetermination of significance issued by the lead agency following coordinated\nreview is binding on all other involved agencies. (4)\n\nUncoordinated review for Unlisted actions\ninvolving more than one agency. (i) An agency\nconducting an uncoordinated review may proceed as if it were the only involved\nagency pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section unless and until it\ndetermines that an action may have a significant adverse impact on the\nenvironment. (ii)\n\nIf an agency\ndetermines that the action may have a significant adverse impact on the\nenvironment, it must then coordinate with other involved agencies. (iii)\n\nAt any time prior to its final decision\nan agency may have its negative declaration superseded by a positive\ndeclaration by any other involved agency. (5)\n\nActions for which lead agency cannot be\nagreed upon: (i) If, within the 30 calendar\ndays allotted for establishment of lead agency, the involved agencies are\nunable to agree upon which agency will be the lead agency, any involved agency\nor the project sponsor may request, by certified mail or other form of\nreceipted delivery to the commissioner, that a lead agency be designated. Simultaneously, copies of the request must be sent by certified mail or other\nform of receipted delivery to all involved agencies and the project sponsor. Any agency raising a dispute must be ready to assume the lead agency functions\nif such agency is designated by the commissioner. (ii)\n\nThe request must identify each involved\nagency's jurisdiction over the action, and all relevant information necessary\nfor the commissioner to apply the criteria in subparagraph (v) of this\nparagraph, and state that all comments must be submitted to the commissioner\nwithin 10 calendar days after receipt of the request. (iii)\n\nWithin 10 calendar days of the date a\ncopy of the request is received by them, involved agencies and the project\nsponsor may submit to the commissioner any comments they may have on the\naction. Such comments must contain the information indicated in subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph. (iv)\n\nThe\ncommissioner must designate a lead agency within 20 calendar days of the date\nthe request or any supplemental information the commissioner has required is\nreceived, based on a review of the facts, the criteria below, and any comments\nreceived. (v) The commissioner\nwill use the following criteria, in order of importance, to designate lead\nagency: (a) whether the anticipated impacts\nof the action being considered are primarily of statewide, regional, or local\nsignificance (i.e., if such impacts are of primarily local significance, all\nother considerations being equal, the local agency involved will be lead\nagency); (b) which agency has the\nbroadest governmental powers for investigation of the impact(s) of the proposed\naction; and\n(c) which agency has\nthe greatest capability for providing the most thorough environmental\nassessment of the proposed action. (vi)\n\nNotice of the commissioner's designation\nof lead agency will be mailed to all involved agencies and the project sponsor. (6)\n\nRe-establishment of\nlead agency. (i) Re-establishment of lead\nagency may occur by agreement of all involved agencies in the following\ncircumstances: (a) for a supplement to a\nfinal EIS or generic EIS; (b) upon\nfailure of the lead agency's basis of jurisdiction; or\n(c) upon agreement of the project sponsor, prior to the acceptance of a draft EIS. (ii)\n\nDisputes concerning re-establishment of\nlead agency for a supplement to a final EIS or generic EIS are subject to the\ndesignation procedures contained in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. (iii)\n\nNotice of re-establishment of lead\nagency must be given by the new lead agency to the project sponsor within 10\ndays of its establishment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
