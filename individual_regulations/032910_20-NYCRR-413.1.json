In addition, the distributor must report such further information as the\ndepartment may require, including the extent of the distributor's sales, transfers, uses or other dispositions of motor fuel in New York State during\nthe period covered by the return. Where a distributor purchased motor fuel upon\nwhich the tax imposed pursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law was paid and in\neach instance the tax was included in the price of such fuel, a credit against\nsales, transfers, uses and other distributions of such fuel is allowed to the\nextent such motor fuel was so purchased.
