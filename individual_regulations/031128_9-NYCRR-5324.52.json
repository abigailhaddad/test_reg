If such a player rejects the dice, the\nstickperson shall offer the dice to each of the other players in turn, clockwise around the table until one of the players accepts the dice. (2)\n\nThe mini craps dealer or the optional\nmini craps stickperson shall offer the set of dice to the player immediately to\nthe dealer's left at the table. If such player rejects the dice, the dealer or\nstickperson shall offer the dice to each of the other players in turn, clockwise around the table until one of the players accepts the dice. (3)\n\nThe first player to accept the dice when\noffered shall become the shooter, who shall select and retain two of the dice\noffered. The remaining dice shall be returned to the dice cup and: (i) in craps, be placed immediately in front\nof the craps stickperson; and\n(ii)\nin mini craps, be placed immediately in front of the mini craps dealer or\nstickperson. (g) Throw of the dice. Prior to the selection\nof the dice, the shooter shall make a pass or don't pass bet, after which the\nshooter shall throw the two selected dice so that the dice leave the shooter's\nhand simultaneously and in a manner calculated to cause the dice to strike the\nend of the table farthest from the shooter. (h) Point throw; settlement of wagers. (1)\n\nWhen the dice come to rest from a valid\nthrow, the craps stickperson or the mini craps dealer or stickperson shall call\nout the sum of the numbers on the high or uppermost sides of the two dice. Only\none face on each die shall be considered skyward. (i) When either die does not, or both of the\ndice do not, land flat on the table (for example, one edge of a die is resting\ncocked on a stack of chips), the side directly opposite the side that is\nresting on the chips or other object shall be considered uppermost and skyward. If more than one side of a die is resting on a stack of chips or other object, the roll shall be void and the dice shall be re-rolled. (ii)\n\nIf there is a dispute as to which face\nis uppermost: (a) in craps, the boxperson\nshall have discretion to determine which face is uppermost or shall void the\nthrow and order the dice to be re-rolled; and\n(b) in mini craps, the floorperson shall have\ndiscretion to determine which face is uppermost or shall void the throw and\norder the dice to be re-rolled. (2)\n\nIn craps, after calling the throw, the\nstickperson shall collect the dice and bring the dice to the center of the\ntable between the stickperson and the boxperson. All wagers decided by such\nthrow shall then be settled, following which the stickperson shall pass the\ndice to the shooter for the next throw. When collecting the dice and passing\nthe dice to the shooter, the stickperson shall use a stick designed for such\npurpose. (3)\n\nIn mini craps, after\ncalling the throw, the dealer or stickperson shall collect the dice and bring\nthe dice to the center of the table. All wagers decided by such throw then\nshall be settled, following which the dealer or stickperson shall pass the dice\nto the shooter for the next throw. When collecting the dice and passing the\ndice to the shooter, the dealer or stickperson shall use a stick designed for\nsuch purpose. (i) Continuation of shooter as such; selection of new shooter. (1)\n\nIt shall be the option of the shooter\nafter any roll to either to pass the dice or remain the shooter, except: (i) the shooter shall pass the dice upon\nthrowing a loser 7; and\n(ii)\nthe\ncraps boxperson or the mini craps dealer may order the shooter to pass the dice\nif the shooter unreasonably delays the game, repeatedly makes invalid rolls or\nviolates the provisions of this section. (2)\n\nIf, after making the come out point, the\nshooter elects not to place a pass or don't pass bet, and other wagers remain\non the table with respect to come and/or don't come numbers, the craps\nstickperson or the mini craps dealer or stickperson shall offer the dice to the\nplayer immediately to the left of the previous shooter, as provided for in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision. If there are no other players at the table, or if no other players at the table elect to make a pass or don't pass bet in\norder to shoot the dice and continue the game, the previous shooter shall be\nallowed to shoot the dice without a pass or don't pass bet only for the purpose\nof effecting a decision on the remaining come and/or don't come wagers. The\non/off marker shall be placed on the don't pass line in the off position in\nfront of the shooter in order to indicate that the shooter is rolling the dice\nonly to effectuate a decision for those wagers remaining on the layout. Once\nthe remaining come and/or don't come wagers have been decided or a player\nwishes to place a pass or don't pass bet, the game shall proceed. (3)\n\nWhenever a voluntary or compulsory\nrelinquishment of the dice occurs by the shooter, the craps stickperson or the\nmini craps dealer or stickperson shall offer the complete set of five or more\ndice to the player immediately to the left of the previous shooter and, if such\nplayer does not accept, to each of the other players in turn clockwise around\nthe table. (4)\n\nThe first player to\naccept the dice when offered shall become the new shooter who shall select and\nretain two of the dice offered. The remaining dice shall be returned to the\ndice cup, which shall be placed in front of the craps stickperson or the mini\ncraps dealer or stickperson. (j) Additional procedures and rules for the\nfire bet. (1)\n\nIf a gaming facility elects to\noffer the fire bet in the game of craps as set forth in paragraph (40) of\nsubdivision (c) of this section, subparagraphs (i) through (x) of this\nparagraph shall apply.

(ii)\n\nWhenever there is a voluntary or\ncompulsory surrender of the dice by a shooter pursuant to paragraph (3) of\nsubdivision (j) of this section prior to the throwing of a loser 7, any pending\nfire bet shall be settled upon the successor shooter throwing a loser\n7. (iii)\n\nOnce all fire bets are\nplaced, the dealer shall bring in each fire bet in numerical order and place\nsuch bet on the corresponding number of the designated area in front of the\ncraps bank of chips, where such bets shall remain until such bets are either\nlost or paid. (iv)\n\nWith each\nindividual point made by a shooter, the dealer shall place a fire bet point\nmarker inscribed with the total number of different points made by the shooter\nin the area of the table layout containing the number of the point (4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10) that was just made. Each fire bet point marker shall be visually\ndistinguishable from and have a diameter larger than any authorized chip. Fire\nbet point markers shall be maintained by the boxperson at the craps\ntable. (v) Fire bets shall be\ncollected or paid, as applicable, upon a shooter throwing a loser 7. (vi)\n\nOnce four different points are made, the\ngaming facility's surveillance department shall be notified for the purpose of\nconfirming all fire bets and payouts. (vii)\n\nThe minimum wager shall be $1 and the\nmaximum wager shall be $5 and all wagers shall be made in increments of one\ndollar.

(3)\n\nThe\ncall of \"no roll\" under either subparagraphs (i), (ii) or (vi) of paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision shall, whenever possible, be made before both dice come to\nrest. (4)\nA throw of the dice that\nresults in the die or dice coming into contact with any wagering instrument on\nthe table, other than the craps bank of chips located in front of the\nboxperson, shall not be a cause for a call of \"no roll.\"\n(5)\n\"No roll\" may be called: (i) in craps, by a boxperson or stickperson, as designated by the gaming facility; and\n(ii)\nin mini-craps, by the dealer, stickperson or floorperson, as designated by the gaming facility.
