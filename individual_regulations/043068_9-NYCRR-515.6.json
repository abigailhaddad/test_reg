  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 515.6 - Rights warnings given to the accused\n\nState Regulations\n(See chapter 2, FM 27-1, Legal Guide for\n\nCommanders.)\n(a) Section 130.31 of the\n\nNew York Military Law is the equivalent of article 31 of the UCMJ. This section\nrequires that no person subject to this code may compel any person to answer\nany question which may tend to incriminate himself. Accordingly, no questioning\nof any accused or person suspected of an offense may take place without that\nperson having been advised of the following: (1)\nthe nature of the accusation; (2)\nthat he has a right to remain\nsilent; (3)\nthat if he gives up the\nright to remain silent, any statement he makes may be used against him as\nevidence in a court-martial. (b) Although not specifically referred to in\nsection 130.31, the suspect or accused shall also be further advised that he\nhas a right to consult with counsel before answering any questions or deciding\nwhether he should answer any questions. He should be further advised that he\nmay seek the assistance of counsel at any stage of questioning should he\nconsent to be questioned. (c) Where\nthe suspect or accused requests counsel, a judge advocate shall be provided by\nthe State at no expense to the person and without regard to his indigence or\nlack thereof before the interrogation proceeds. In addition, the suspect or\naccused may retain civilian counsel at no expense to the State. (d) After receiving section 130.31 warnings, the suspect may indicate that he wishes to waive his rights to remain silent\nand to consult with a lawyer. These rights must be waived freely, knowingly, and intelligently. The suspect may then be questioned concerning the offense. If the suspect indicates that he wishes to consult a lawyer, the accused should\nnot be questioned until a lawyer is present. See Appendix L-2 Procedural Rights\n\nWarning Form, DMNA form 1061. (e) If the accused or suspect indicates that he does not wish to answer questions, no questions should be asked. In any case, it is essential that the commander\nnot use a tone of voice which could lead the suspect to believe that he is\nbeing threatened or which plays down the importance of the warning. If this is\ndone, it may later be held that the suspect's agreement to answer questions was\ngained by coercion or improper inducement. The statement would then be\ninadmissible in a trial by court-martial. A company commander may decide not to\nquestion a suspect if other evidence is available. (f) If the person being interviewed is not\nsuspected of having committed an offense, but is merely a witness to the\noffense or has knowledge of it, there is no legal requirement to give the\nindividual a rights warning. During the questioning, the commander may begin to\nsuspect that the witness was involved in the offense. This may happen when it\nappears that the witness was actually an accomplice or an accessory to the\ncrime. The commander should then stop the questioning, inform the witness of\nthe offense of which he is now suspected, and advise him of the rights\npreviously described. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
