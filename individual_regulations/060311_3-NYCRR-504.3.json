BSA/AML detection scenarios with threshold values and amounts designed to\ndetect potential money laundering or other suspicious or illegal\nactivities; 5. end-to-end, pre-and\npost-implementation testing of the Transaction Monitoring Program, including, as relevant, a review of governance, data mapping, transaction coding, detection scenario logic, model validation, data input and Program\noutput; 6. documentation that\narticulates the institution's current detection scenarios and the underlying\nassumptions, parameters, and thresholds; 7. protocols setting forth how alerts\ngenerated by the Transaction Monitoring Program will be investigated, the\nprocess for deciding which alerts will result in a filing or other action, the\noperating areas and individuals responsible for making such a decision, and how\nthe investigative and decision-making process will be documented; and\n8. be subject to an on-going analysis to\nassess the continued relevancy of the detection scenarios, the underlying\nrules, threshold values, parameters, and assumptions.

(c) Each Transaction Monitoring\nand Filtering Program shall require the following, to the extent applicable: 1. identification of all data sources that\ncontain relevant data; 2. validation of the integrity, accuracy and quality of data to ensure that\naccurate and complete data flows through the Transaction Monitoring and\n\nFiltering Program; 3. data\nextraction and loading processes to ensure a complete and accurate transfer of\ndata from its source to automated monitoring and filtering systems, if\nautomated systems are used; 4. governance and management oversight, including policies and procedures\ngoverning changes to the Transaction Monitoring and Filtering Program to ensure\nthat changes are defined, managed, controlled, reported, and audited; 5. vendor selection process if a third party\nvendor is used to acquire, install, implement, or test the Transaction\n\nMonitoring and Filtering Program or any aspect of it; 6. funding to design, implement and maintain\na Transaction Monitoring and Filtering Program that complies with the\nrequirements of this Part; 7. qualified personnel or outside consultant(s) responsible for the design, planning, implementation, operation, testing, validation, and ongoing analysis\nof the Transaction Monitoring and Filtering Program, including automated\nsystems if applicable, as well as case management, review and decision making\nwith respect to generated alerts and potential filings; and\n8. periodic training of all stakeholders with\nrespect to the Transaction Monitoring and Filtering Program. (d) To the extent a Regulated\n\nInstitution has identified areas, systems, or processes that require material\nimprovement, updating or redesign, the Regulated Institution shall document the\nidentification and the remedial efforts planned and underway to address such\nareas, systems or processes. Such documentation must be available for\ninspection by the Superintendent. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
