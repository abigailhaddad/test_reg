  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 220-1.6 - Source monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The owner or operator of a portland\ncement kiln or clinker cooler must maintain a file of daily clinker production\nrates, kiln feed rates, and any particulate emission measurements. The\nproduction and feed rates must be summarized monthly. The records and summary\nmust be retained for atleast five years following the date of such records and\nsummaries and must be made available for inspection by the department during\nnormal business hours. (b) PM\nemissions tests, The owner or operator of a kiln and clinker cooler subject to\nlimitations on PM emissions shall demonstrate initial compliance by conducting\na performance test using Method 5 or Method 5I in appendix A-3 of 40 CFR Part\n60. The owner must also monitor performance through use of a PM continuous\nparametric monitoring system (PM CPMS), in accordance with\n40 CFR\n63.1349(b)(1). (c) The owner or operator of a portland\ncement kiln shall demonstrate compliance with the\nNO\nx\nRACT emission limit(s) established in section\n220-1.6\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart by measuring NO\nx\nemissions with a continuous\nemissions monitoring system (CEMS). The CEMS shall comply with the requirements\nof subdivision (d) of this section or with equivalent requirements approved by\nthe department. Any approved equivalent CEMS requirement will be submitted by\nthe department to the United States Environmental Protection Agency for\napproval as separate State Implementation Plan revisions. (d) 'CEMS requirements'. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of a portland\ncement kiln shall install, calibrate, evaluate, operate, and maintain a CEMS, in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR part\n60, Appendix F for measuring\nNO\nx\nat locations approved in the CEMS certification\nprotocol under paragraph (3) of this subdivision, and shall record the output\nof the system. (2)\n\nAs part of its\napplication for a permit or permit modification, the owner or operator of a\nportland cement kiln shall submit for department approval a CEMS monitoring\nplan that complies with the provisions of 40 CFR part\n60, Appendix F. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator of a portland\ncement kiln shall submit for department approval a CEMS certification protocol\nat least 60 days prior to CEMS certification testing. The certification\nprotocol shall include the location of and specifications for each instrument\nor device, as well as procedures for calibration, operation, data evaluation, and datareporting. (4)\n\nThe\nprocedures in subparagraphs (i) through (v) of this paragraph shall be used for\ndetermining compliance with the NO\nx\nRACT emission limit\nestablished under subdivision\n220-1.6\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (i) The owner or operator of a\nportland cement kiln shall determine compliance daily on a 30 day rolling\naverage basis. The 30 day rolling averages shall be calculated by dividing 30\nday total NO\nx\nemissions by 30 day total clinker\nproduction. Only days when the kiln operates shall be included in the 30 day\nrolling averages. (ii)\n\nAlong with\nany specific additional data requirements mandated by the department for a\nparticular portland cement kiln, annual re-certifications, quarterly accuracy, and daily calibration drift tests shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR\npart\n60, Appendix F. (5)\n(i) The owner or operator of a portland\ncement kiln shall notify the department of the planned initial start-up date of\nany new CEMS. (ii)\n\nEmissions, monitoring, and operating parameter records or measurements required by this\n\nSubpart and any additional parameters required by the department shall be\nmaintained for at least five years and made available to the department upon\nrequest. (iii)\n\nOn a semi-annual\nbasis, the owner or operator of a portland cement kiln shall tabulate and\nsummarize applicable emissions, monitoring, and operating parameter\nmeasurements recorded during the preceding six months, and submit these\nrecordsto the department. These records shall be submitted in a format\nacceptable to the department and shall include: ('a')\nthe 30 day rolling average\nNO\nx\nemissions as specified under paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision; ('b')\nidentification\nof the operating hours when NO\nX\nemissions data are not\nincluded in a calculation of the 30 day rolling average emissions and the\nreasons for not including that data; ('c')\na comparison of the\nNO\nx\nemissions to the NO\nX\nRACT\nemissions limit(s); ('d')\ntype and\namount of fuel burned on a daily basis and the as burned heat content of the\nfuel; ('e')\nthe total daily\nNO\nx\nemissions and total daily clinker production; and\n('f')\nthe results of CEMS\naccuracy assessments as required by 40 CFR part\n60, Appendix F and any\nadditional data quality information required by the\ndepartment. (e) Protocols, reports, summaries, schedules, and any other information required to be submitted to the department under\nprovisions of this Subpart must be sent (in either hardcopy or electronically)\nas follows: (1)\none copy to the Division of\n\nAir Resources, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, 625\n\nBroadway, Albany, New York 12233; and\n(2)\none copy to the regional air pollution\ncontrol engineer at the appropriate regional office of the\ndepartment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n220-1.6\n\nRenumbered from 220-1.7\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register August 21, 2024/Volume XLVI, Issue 34, eff. 9/5/2024\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. (a) The\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nmay purchase and use\nfuel\nwith a sulfur content exceeding the\nfuel\nsulfur limitations required by Subpart 225-1\nof this Title, provided that the burning of such\nfuel\nwill not result in emissions of sulfur compounds (expressed as sulfur dioxide) to the\noutdoor atmosphere\nat a rate greater than would result through the use of fuels otherwise mandated by Subpart 225-1. (b) The\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nmust submit a\nreasonably available control technology (RACT)\nanalysis to the\ndepartment\nfor emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO\nx\n) from the kiln that proposes a RACT\nemission\nlimit(s), and identifies the procedures and monitoring equipment to be used to demonstrate compliance with the proposed RACT\nemission\nlimit(s). The RACT emissions limit(s) shall be expressed in pounds of NO\nx\nper ton of\nclinker\nproduced. (1)\n\nBy December 1, 2010 the\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nthat was in operation prior to the effective date of this Subpart must submit a RACT analysis, and an application for a permit\nmodification\nin accordance with the provisions of Subpart 201-6\nof this Title\nunless the existing NO\nx\ncontrol equipment and\nemission\nlimit(s) are determined to be RACT. RACT, as approved by the\ndepartment, must be implemented by July 1, 2012. (2)\n\nThe\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nthat was not in operation prior to the effective date of this Subpart must submit a RACT analysis prior to start up of the kiln. RACT, as approved by the\ndepartment, must be implemented upon start up. (3)\nRACT analyses must include the available NO\nx\ncontrol technologies, the projected effectiveness of the technologies considered, the costs for installation and operation for each of the technologies, and the technology and the appropriate\nemission\nlimit(s) selected as RACT considering the costs for installation and operation of the technology. For a\nportland cement kiln\nthat was in operation prior to the effective date of this Subpart and for which the existing NO\nx\ncontrol equipment has been determined to not be RACT, the RACT analysis must also include a schedule for installation of control equipment. (4)\n\nApproved RACT determinations will be submitted by the\ndepartment\nto the United States Environmental Protection Agency for approval as separate\n\nState Implementation Plan\nrevisions. (c) The\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nmay opt to comply with subdivision (b) of this section and section\n220-1.7\n(c) of this Subpart by shutting down the kiln. An\nowner\nor\noperator\nchoosing this option shall submit an application for a\nfederally enforceable\npermit\nmodification\nby December 1, 2010 wherein the\nowner\nor\noperator\ncommits to permanently shut down the kiln by July 1, 2012.
