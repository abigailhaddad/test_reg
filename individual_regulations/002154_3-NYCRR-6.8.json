The Office of the Comptroller of\nthe Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, in interpreting these\nsections, permit national banks and Federal savings associations, respectively, to impose greater daily charges in connection with overdraft protection\nprograms than is otherwise allowed under New York Banking Law for banks and\ntrust companies, savings banks and savings and loan associations.
