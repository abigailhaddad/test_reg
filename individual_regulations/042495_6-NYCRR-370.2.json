(208)\n\nUniversal waste\nmeans\nany of the following hazardous wastes that are managed under the universal\nwaste requirements of Subpart 374-3 of t his Title: (i) batteries as described in section\n374-3.1\n(b) of this\n\nTitle; (ii)\npesticides as described\nin section\n374-3.1\n(c) of this\n\nTitle; (iii)\nmercury-containing\nequipment as described in section\n374-3.1\n(d) of this\n\nTitle; (iv)\nlamps as described in\nsection\n374-3.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle; (v) aerosol cans as\ndescribed in section\n374-3.1\n(f) of this\n\nTitle; and\n(vi)\npaint as described\nin section\n374-3.1\n(g) of this\n\nTitle. (209)\n\nUniversal waste handler: (i) means: ('a')\na generator (as defined in this\nsubdivision) of universal waste; or\n('b')\nthe owner or operator of a facility, including all contiguous property, that receives universal waste from other\nuniversal waste handlers, accumulates universal waste, and sends universal\nwaste to another universal waste handler, to a destination facility, or foreign\ndestination; (ii)\ndoes\nnot mean: ('a')\na person who treats, disposes\nof, or recycles universal waste (except as provided in 374-3.2(d) and\n374-3.3(d)); or\n('b')\na person\nengaged in the off-site transportation of universal waste by air, rail, highway, or water, including a universal waste transfer\nfacility.
