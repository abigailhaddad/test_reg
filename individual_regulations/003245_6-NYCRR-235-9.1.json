  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 235-9.1 - Test methods\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Testing to\ndetermine compliance with the requirements of this Part, shall be performed\nusing CARB Test Method 310, Determination of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC)\nin Consumer Products (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). For the\npurposes of this Subpart, CARB Test Method 310 reference to Executive Officer\nwill be replaced by director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation. Alternative methods which are shown to accurately\ndetermine the concentration of VOCs in a subject product or its emissions may\nbe used upon approval of the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation. When approved by the director, Division of Air\n\nResources, Department of Environmental Conservation, the alternative test\nmethod will be submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency\nas a State Implementation Plan revision for approval. Information submitted to\nthe director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental\n\nConservation may be claimed as confidential; such information will be handled\nin accordance with the confidentiality procedures specified in applicable New\n\nYork State laws and regulations. (b) 'VOC content determinations using product formulation and records'. Testing to\ndetermine compliance with the requirements of this Part may also be\ndemonstrated through calculation of the VOC content from records of the amounts\nof constituents used to make the product pursuant to the following criteria: (1)\n\nCompliance determinations based on these\nrecords may not be used unless the manufacturer of a consumer product keeps\naccurate records for each day of production of the amount and chemical\ncomposition of the individual product constituents. These records must be kept\nfor at least three years. (2)\n\nIf\nproduct records appear to demonstrate compliance with the VOC content limits, but these records are contradicted by product testing performed using CARB Test\n\nMethod 310 (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), the results\nof CARB Test Method 310 shall take precedence over the product records and may\nbe used to establish a violation of the requirements of this Part. (c) 'Determination of liquid or\nsolid'. Testing to determine whether a product is a liquid or solid shall be\nperformed using ASTM D 4359-90 (2000)el (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). (d) 'Compliance determinations for charcoal\nlighter material products'. Testing to determine compliance with the\ncertification requirements for charcoal lighter material shall be performed\nusing the procedures specified in the South Coast Air Quality Management\n\nDistrict Rule 1174 Ignition Method Compliance Certification Protocol (see Table\n1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). (e) Testing to determine distillation points\nof petroleum distillate-based charcoal lighter materials shall be performed\nusing ASTM D 86-90 (September 28, 1990) (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). (f) No person shall create, alter, falsify, or otherwise modify records in such a way that the records do not accurately\nreflect the constituents used to manufacture a product, the chemical\ncomposition of the individual product, and any other test, processes, or\nrecords used in connection with product manufacture.
