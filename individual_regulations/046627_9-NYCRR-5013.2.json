  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5013.2 - Quick Draw game play\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Game components\nand draws. Each Quick Draw game shall have a base-wager component and, if the\ncommission so chooses to offer, a Money Dots wager component. A Quick Draw game\ndraw shall comprise the drawing of the Quick Draw base-wager winning numbers, followed by the drawing on the Money Dots wager winning number, if the\ncommission elects to offer such wager. Each Quick Draw game shall be assigned a\nunique multi-digit consecutive number by the central computer system, which\ncorresponds to a particular draw. Draws will be held daily at intervals during\nthe hours designated by the commission. If for any reason a draw cannot be\nheld, the next draw will take place at the next scheduled draw time and any\nissued bet ticket for the draw not held instead shall be valid for the next\nscheduled and completed draw. (b) Wager types. (1)\n\nQuick Draw base wager. (i) To make a Quick Draw base wager, a player\nselects: (a) a quantity of spots, from 1 to\n10; (b) a wager of $1, $2, $3, $4, $5 or $10 per draw; (c) the number\nof consecutive draws the player wishes to play, beginning with the next\nscheduled draw; (d) numbers from a\nfield of 80 numbers in the same quantity of spots selected, or chooses a Quick\n\nPick option, in which the commission's central computer system randomly selects\nthe numbers for the player after the player designates the quantity of spots to\nplay. (ii)\n\nThe total\nwager amount allowed on a single Quick Draw play card may be capped, with the\nallowable total wager designated by the commission on the Quick Draw play\ncard. (iii)\nA single-draw Quick\n\nDraw bet ticket may be cancelled at the same computer terminal from which such\nticket was issued, but only on the day of purchase and prior to the draw. A\nmultiple-draw ticket may be cancelled only prior to the first draw stated on\nsuch ticket. (iv)\n\nIf a player\nredeems a winning Quick Draw base-wager ticket prior to all draws referred to\nthereon having been completed, an exchange ticket shall be issued, indicating\nthe remaining draws to which the wager applies. An exchange ticket cannot be\ncancelled. (v) For each draw, a\nrandom-number generator shall select 20 numbers from a field of 80 numbers to\nconstitute the Quick Draw base-wager winning numbers. (vi)\n\nPrizes for winning Quick Draw base\nwagers will be awarded for tickets on which various numbers of player\nselections match the winning numbers drawn for the assigned drawing, with\nprizes and payouts as set forth in section\n5013.3\nof this Part. (vii)\n\nThe commission may offer a Quick Draw\n\nExtra feature as an addition to a player's Quick Draw base wager. (a) A Quick Draw Extra wager shall double the\ncost of the Quick Draw base wager. For example, if a player purchases a $1\n\nQuick Draw base wager and Quick Draw Extra is also played, the total cost of\nthe wager shall be $2 ($1 for the Quick Draw base wager and $1 for Quick Draw\n\nExtra). (b) When this feature is\nactive, the randomly selected Extra symbol, with odds of selection as set forth\nin item (c) of this subparagraph, shall appear on the video monitor immediately\nfollowing selection of the winning Quick Draw base-wager numbers. (c) A player who has made a Quick Draw Extra\nwager shall win only the player's base-wager prize, if any, when the \"No extra\"\nsymbol is selected. A player who has made a Quick Draw Extra wager shall win a\nmultiple of the player's base-wager prize, if any, in the multiple indicated by\nthe number associated with the symbol, when one of the following symbols is\nselected: 2X, 3X, 4X, 5X or 10X. Symbol\n\nOdds of selection, 1 in\n\nNo extra\n2.5\n2X\n2.35\n3X\n16\n4X\n16\n5X\n26.67\n10X\n80\n(2)\n\nMoney Dots wager. The rules set forth in\nthis paragraph shall apply when the commission chooses to offer a Money Dots\nwager within a Quick Draw game. If a Money Dots wager is offered, a player may\nmake the wager separate from a Quick Draw base wager. (i) To make a Money Dots wager, a player\ncompletes a Money Dots play card to select the number of consecutive draws such\nplayer desires to play or requests manual entry. The commission may choose to\noffer a Quick Draw play card that contains a designated area for a player to\nmake a Money Dots wager, instead of completing a Money Dots play\ncard. (ii)\n\nPlay on a Money Dots\nwager occurs with the next Quick Draw game that is not already in progress at\nthe time the Money Dots wager is registered on the commission's central\ncomputer system. (iii)\n\nThe price of\neach bet for a Money Dots wager is $1 per draw. (iv)\nA player making a Money Dots wager shall\nbe issued a bet ticket on which eight randomly assigned numbers from the Quick\n\nDraw field of 80 are displayed. (v) After the 20 Quick Draw base-wager winning numbers are drawn in a Quick Draw\ngame, dollar values of $5, $10, $20 or $50 shall be randomly assigned to each\nof the remaining 60 numbers that were not selected as base-wager winning\nnumbers for that Quick Draw game, consistent with the odds set forth in\nparagraph (2) of subdivision (a) of section\n5013.3\nof this Part. (vi)\n\nAfter the 60 remaining numbers in the\n\nQuick Draw game (which have not been selected as base-wager winning numbers)\nhave been assigned dollar values, a randomly selected Money Dots winning number\nshall be displayed. A player wins a Money Dots bet, in the dollar amount\nassigned to the winning number pursuant to subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, if the Money Dots winning number drawn matches one of the numbers assigned to\nthe player's Money Dots bet ticket for the assigned drawing pursuant to\nsubparagraph (iv) of this subdivision. (c) Price fixed by commission. No person\nshall sell a Quick Draw bet ticket at a price greater than those fixed by the\ncommission. (d) Minimum age. (1)\n\nNo Quick Draw bet ticket shall be sold to\na person under the age of 18 years. On the premises of a licensee who holds a\nlicense issued pursuant to the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law to sell alcoholic\nbeverages for consumption on the premises, no Quick Draw bet ticket shall be\nsold to a person under the age of 21 years and no person under the age of 21\nyears may participate in a Quick Draw game. (2)\n\nThe commission shall penalize a licensee\nfound to have violated paragraph (1) of this subdivision according to the\nprovisions of paragraph (2) of subdivision (c) of section\n5001.27\nof this Chapter. (e) Premises. Quick Draw bet\ntickets may be purchased only at a licensed Quick Draw agent location. Quick\n\nDraw tickets shall be sold only on premises satisfying the following, as\nrequired by Tax Law section 1612(a)(1)(A): (1)\n\nIf the premises are not used for the sale\nof alcoholic beverages for consumption on the premises, the lottery sales agent\nmust have certified in writing that the premises comprise an area greater than\n2,500 square feet.
