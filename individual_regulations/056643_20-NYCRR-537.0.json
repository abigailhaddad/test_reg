  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 537.0 - General information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Purpose of this section. The general information contained in this section\nhighlights and summarizes the rights, obligations and liabilities of both\npurchasers and sellers in a bulk sale transaction. This general information\ndoes not supplant the provisions of the subsequent sections of this Part, which\ncontain fully detailed information and examples with respect to bulk\nsales. (b) Filing requirements. (1)\nA person who purchases in bulk the whole\nor any part of the business assets of a person required to collect tax must, at\nleast 10 days before taking possession of such assets or paying for the same, whichever comes first, file with the Department of Taxation and Finance a\nnotice of bulk sale. A form for this purpose may be obtained from the Taxpayer\n\nAssistance Bureau, Department of Taxation and Finance, State Campus, Albany, NY\n12227, or from the Taxpayer Assistance Bureau at any district office of the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. (2)\n\nIn addition, every such purchaser who\nintends commencing business or opening up a new place of business, and who will\nbe required to collect any sales and compensating use tax or who will sell\ntangible personal property for resale must, at least 20 days prior to\ncommencing business or opening a new place of business or purchasing business\nassets or making payment for the same, whichever comes first, file a\ncertificate of registration with the department. Such certificate of\nregistration form can be obtained from the Taxpayer Assistance Bureau, Department of Taxation and Finance, State Campus, Albany, NY 12227 or from the\n\nTaxpayer Assistance Bureau at any district office of the Department of Taxation\nand Finance. (See section\n533.1\nof\nthis Title for more information on vendor registration.)\n(c) Purchaser's rights and liabilities. (1)\n\nIf the purchaser files a proper and\ntimely notice of bulk sale with the Department of Taxation and Finance and the\n\nDivision of Taxation gives notice to the purchaser of a possible claim for\ntaxes due, the purchaser is forbidden to transfer any funds or property due the\nseller except the portion of such funds in excess of the State's\nclaim. (2)\n\nFailure to file a proper\nand timely notice of bulk sale by a purchaser will result in personal liability\nof the purchaser for taxes due from the seller, limited to the purchase price\nor the fair market value of the business assets sold, whichever is\nhigher. (3)\n\nWithin 90 days of the\nnotice of bulk sale, the Division of Taxation will give notice of the actual\namount of taxes due from the seller to both the seller and the purchaser. Upon\nreceipt of such notice, the purchaser may pay the amount of such claim to the\n\nState and be relieved of all further liability with respect to such amounts to\nthe seller. If the Division of Taxation does not give notice within 90 days of\nthe total amount of taxes due, the purchaser, after such 90-day period, may\nrelease the funds to the seller, and the purchaser is relieved from both his\nobligation to further withhold such funds and his liability for the taxes due\nfrom the seller (except for any sales and use taxes due on the transfer of\ntangible personal property from the seller to the purchaser). (4)\n\nIf the seller makes payment of taxes due\nand such payment reduces the liability of the seller to an amount which is less\nthan the amount for which the purchaser was derivatively liable, this\nderivative liability of the purchaser is reduced to the extent of the\ndifference in such amounts and the purchaser will be notified accordingly. (See\nsection\n537.4\n[i]\nof this Part for examples of this general statement.)\n(d) Seller's rights and liabilities. (1)\nA seller who ceases the conduct of a\nbusiness must file a final return within 20 days after ceasing such conduct of\nthe business, and is required to pay all taxes due to the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance with such return. In addition, the seller must surrender\nhis certificate of authority to do business by attaching the certificate to and\nsubmitting the same with the final return. (See section\n533.3\n[e]\nof this Title for more information on filing final returns.)\n(2)\nA seller is entitled to have the tax due\nfinally and irrevocably fixed in accordance with the provisions of subdivision\n(c) of section\n1138\nof the Tax Law. (3)\nA seller shall give each prospective bulk\npurchaser of the business assets a copy of the notice to prospective purchasers\nrelating to the purchaser's bulk sale notice requirements. Copies of such\nnotice may be obtained from the Taxpayer Assistance Bureau, Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance, State Campus, Albany, NY 12227, or from the Taxpayer\n\nAssistance Bureau at any district office of the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. (4)\n\nPrior to the bulk\nsale, a seller may request and the Division of Taxation may, in its discretion, perform an audit of the books and records of the seller to determine his tax\nliability up to the date of sale of his business assets. The request for such\nan audit must be made to the Bulk Sales Unit and must include a showing that a\nsale is actually intended. Each seller is limited to one such request during\nany three-year period. Despite the request, the seller will remain liable for\ntaxes due from him to the Department of Taxation and Finance. (5)\n\nThe seller also remains liable for taxes\ndue and owing from him, whether or not the purchaser has been relieved of his\nobligation to pay the taxes due from the seller. (e) Uniform Commercial Code requirements. Where applicable, the purchaser and the seller are also subject to their rights\nand liabilities under article 6 of the Uniform Commercial Code, relating to\ntransfers in bulk. (f) Purchaser's\nrights to a hearing. (1)\nA purchaser is\nentitled to a hearing with the Division of Tax Appeals or a conference with the\n\nBureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services of the Division of Taxation to\nreview his liability for the payment of taxes determined to be due from the\nseller, whether or not the seller's liability has been finally and irrevocably\nfixed, provided the purchaser applies for said hearing or conference within 90\ndays of the mailing by the Division of Taxation of the notice to the purchaser\nof the total amount of taxes claimed to be due from the seller. (2)\nA purchaser is entitled to a hearing with\nthe Division of Tax Appeals or a conference with the Bureau of Conciliation and\n\nMediation Services of the Division of Taxation to review a denial of his\napplication for refund of tax determined to be due from the seller, whether or\nnot the seller's liability has been finally and irrevocably fixed, where the\nfollowing conditions are satisfied: (i) the\npurchaser has paid the tax to the Department of Taxation and Finance; (ii)\nthe purchaser has filed his application\nfor a refund within two years after the giving of notice by the Division of\n\nTaxation to such purchaser of the total amount of the tax which the State\nclaims to be due from the seller; and\n(iii)\nthe purchaser has applied for said\nhearing or conciliation conference within 90 days from the date of denial of\nhis application for a refund. (3)\n\nThe purchaser may obtain a copy of the\npertinent portion of returns or other pertinent information taken from the\nreturns of the seller filed with the department for the periods for which the\npurchaser is being held personally liable. (g) Additional liability of the purchaser and\nthe seller arising from a bulk sale transaction. The sales tax is imposed upon\nthe receipts from the transfer of all tangible personal property from the\nseller to the purchaser which is included in the property sold in bulk, except\nproperty sold for resale as such and except the tangible personal property\nwhich is exempt from the tax. The tax is not imposed on real property or on\nintangible personal property such as good will or accounts receivable. The tax\ndue is required to be paid by the seller as part of his final return or, in the\nalternative, may be paid by the purchaser with a casual sale return. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
