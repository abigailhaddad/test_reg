  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 383-10.4 - Environmental monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Requirements for environmental monitoring. (1)\n\nThe applicant must submit an environmental monitoring plan as part of the\ncomplete permit application. (2)\n\nThe permittee must establish and conduct an environmental monitoring program as\nrequired by this section and in accordance with the environmental monitoring\nplan approved by the department in the permit. The permittee must conduct the\nenvironmental monitoring program from the effective date of the initial permit\nuntil the end of the institutional control period. (3)\n\nThe permittee must design the\nenvironmental monitoring program to provide data that can be used to: (i) detect the movement of radionuclides or\nother contaminants out of the disposal units; (ii)\nevaluate the potential health and\nenvironmental impacts that may arise during operation of the land disposal\nfacility; (iii)\nprovide reasonable\nassurance that the land disposal facility meets the performance\nobjectives; (iv)\nevaluate the\npotential for long-term adverse effects caused by the land disposal facility\nand the need for mitigative measures; (v) evaluate the accuracy of, and need for\nrevision of, the environmental monitoring program; (vi)\nmake a comparison with the data\ncollected during pre-operational monitoring (through such measures as the use\nof the same sampling locations, frequencies, and analyses), where practicable\nand where such measures would not conflict with meeting the other requirements\nof this Subpart; (vii)\nmake a\ncomparison between the properties of the soils and earthen material excavated\nwith design assumptions; and\n(viii)\nduring the operation period, provide data that can be used to assess the\nadequacy and appropriateness of the closure plan. (4)\n\nThe environmental monitoring program must\ninclude: (i) monitoring of direct radiation, including regular surveys to detect surface contamination outside of\nbuildings; (ii)\nmonitoring of air, groundwater, surface water and drainage systems, soil, flora, and fauna for the\nradionuclides in the waste disposed of on the site; (iii)\nmonitoring for seismic activity; and\n(iv)\nevery five years, or as\ndeemed necessary by the department, an aerial radiation survey of the disposal\nsite and the land within a five-mile radius of the disposal site, with the\nresults of the on-site survey referenced to the site grid system required by\nsection\n383-11.2\n(c) of\nthis Part. (5)\n\nMonitoring stations used in the environmental monitoring program must be\nlocated to collect data that will be representative of what is being\nmonitored. (6)\n\nFor the monitoring\nrequired by paragraph (4) of this subdivision, at least one monitoring station\nmust be at each of the following locations: (i) on the disposal site; (ii)\nat the boundary of the site; (iii)\noff-site, but within one mile of the\nsite boundary; and\n(iv)\nat a\nlocation sufficiently removed from the land disposal facility to provide\nbackground data. (7)\n\nThe\nenvironmental monitoring program must have sufficient redundancy and overlap in\nequipment used and media monitored and sampled to provide reasonable assurance\nthat the monitoring requirements of paragraphs (3) and (4) of this subdivision\nwill be met in the event of the failure, loss, or malfunction of individual\nmonitoring stations or equipment. (8)\n\nThe environmental monitoring program must\nbe capable of providing sufficient warning of significant releases of\nradionuclides and other contaminants from the disposal units. Significant\nreleases to the ground, groundwater, or surface water must be detected in\nsufficient time to allow the permittee adequate time to respond before the\nreleased substances reach other disposal units or the site boundary. (9)\n\nThe permittee must periodically evaluate\nall environmental monitoring data to assure the early detection of any\nsignificant releases of radionuclides and other contaminants from the disposal\nunits to allow the permittee adequate time to respond before the released\nsubstances reach the site boundary. (10)\n\nIn addition to the requirements of this\n\nPart, the monitoring requirements of Part 373 of this Title for hazardous\nwastes must be satisfied for the treatment, storage, and disposal of mixed\nwastes. (b) Review and\nrevision of the plan for the environmental monitoring program. The permittee\nmust review the environmental monitoring program plan at least annually and\nrevise it as necessary, subject to the approval of the department. At a\nminimum, the plan must be revised when the permittee or the department\ndetermines that: (1)\nsite characteristics, designs, or operations have changed and the environmental monitoring program is\nno longer appropriate for the changed conditions; (2)\nthe environmental monitoring program is\nno longer sufficient to accurately demonstrate that the performance objectives\nare being met; (3)\nthe\nenvironmental monitoring program is no longer able to provide early warning of\nreleases of radionuclides and other contaminants from the disposal\nsite; (4)\nchanges in conditions of\nthe site have significantly affected or altered the functioning of the\nenvironmental monitoring program; or\n(5)\nthe environmental monitoring program no\nlonger meets the requirements of this Subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n383-10.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
