This Part shall be inapplicable to\nordinary operating refunds that are not attributable to negotiation or to new\nlegislation, adjudication or rulemaking (such as refunds for overpayment of\nestimated taxes, and carry-backs of net operating losses and investment tax\ncredits). For purposes of this Part, a refund is deemed to occur when the\nearlier of the following events occurs, regardless of the possibility of\nsubsequent audit or litigations: (1)\nthe\nrefund is authorized by decision of a competent agency or court; or\n(2)\nthe utility receives it or uses it as an\noffset to liability. (b) The utility shall notify the cormmission within 60 days after the refund occurs\nif the refund: (1)\nexceeds $1,500,000; or\n(2)\nexceeds $1,000 and exceeds\n0.2 percent of the utility's operating revenues for the most recent calendar\nyear that ends more than four months before the refund occurs. (c) In determining whether a\nrefund exceeds 0.2 percent of operating revenues for purposes of paragraph\n(b)(2) of this section: (1)\nin the case of a\ngas, electric, steam or combination utility, operating revenues shall be\nreduced by the amounts properly chargeable to the functional group of\nproduction operation and maintenance expense accounts; (2)\nin the case of a combination utility, the\nrefund shall be deemed to exceed 0.2 percent of operating revenues if, after\nthe refund is allocated among the gas, electric and steam departments in a\nmanner reflecting insofar as possible the extent to which the refund is related\nto each department's activities, one or more of the portions thus allocated\nexceeds 0.2 percent of the operating revenues of the department to which it is\nallocated; (3)\nin the case of a\nwater utility, operating revenues shall be reduced by the amounts properly\nchargeable to the functional groups of source of supply, and pumping operation\nand maintenance, expense accounts; and\n(4)\nin the case of a telephone utility, operating revenues shall not include interstate revenues. (d) In determining whether a refund meets the\ncriteria stated in subdivision (b) of this section, multiple refunds shall be\ntreated as a single refund if they share a common cause such as a common act of\nnegotiation, legislation, adjudication or rulemaking. (e) If a refund does not meet the criteria\nstated in paragraph (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, it shall be reported and\nitemized in the utility's annual report to the commission for the year in which\nthe refund occurs. (f) When giving\nthe commission any notification or report pursuant to this Part, the utility\nalso shall either propose a method of distributing to its customers the entire\namount refunded, or show why it should not make such a distribution.
