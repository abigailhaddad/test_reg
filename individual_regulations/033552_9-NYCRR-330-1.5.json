  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 330-1.5 - Requests for public access to records\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where a request for records is required, such request shall be in writing. (b) (1)\n\nWithin five business days of the receipt of a written request for a record\nreasonably described, the records access officer shall make such record\navailable, deny the request in writing, or furnish a written acknowledgment of\nthe receipt of such request and a statement of the approximate date, which\nshall be reasonable under the circumstances of the request, when such request\nshall be granted or denied, including, where appropriate, a statement that\naccess to the records will be determined in accordance with section\n330-1.7\nof this Subpart. If the\n\nOffice of General Services determines to grant a request in whole or in part, and if circumstances prevent disclosure to the person requesting the record or\nrecords within 20 business days from the date of the acknowledgment of the\nreceipt of the request, the agency shall state, in writing, both the reason for\nthe inability to grant the request within 20 business days and a date certain\nwithin a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances, when the request\nwill be granted in whole or in part. Failure of the Office of General Services\nto conform to the provisions of this subdivision shall constitute a denial of\naccess to records subject to appeal pursuant to section\n330-1.8\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n\nFollowing the issuance\nof such acknowledgment, the records access officer shall grant or deny such\nrequest expeditiously in view of the factual and legal issues relating to the\nrequest, the need for consultation relating to the protection of personal\nprivacy, the volume of the records sought, the search techniques needed to\nlocate the records and the time needed to review them. (c) A request for access to records should be\nsufficiently detailed to identify the records. Where possible, the requester\nshould supply information regarding dates, titles, file designations or other\ninformation which may help identify the records. However, a request for any or\nall records falling within a specific category conforms to the standard that\nrecords be identifiable. (d) (1)\nA current list, by subject matter, of all\nrecords maintained by the agency shall be available for public inspection and\ncopying. The list shall be sufficiently detailed to permit the requester to\nidentify the file category of the record sought. (2)\n\nThe subject matter list shall be updated\nperiodically and the date of the most recent updating shall appear on the first\npage. The updating of the subject matter list shall not be less than\nsemiannual. (e) No\nrecords may be removed by the requester from the office where the record is\nlocated. (f) Records which have\ncopyright protection may unless otherwise exempt from disclosure, be examined\nand viewed but may not be reproduced by or on behalf of the requesting\nparty. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n330-1.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
