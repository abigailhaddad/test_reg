  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-2.1 - Elements to be accounted for\n\nState Regulations\n\nEvery transaction involving investments can be broken\ndown into component elements, such as purchase or sales price, accrued interest\npurchased or sold, expense of acquisition or disposition, etc. Some or all of\nthese elements will be present in every investment transaction. For example, some securities are bought and sold on the open market. Some may be bought\nthrough brokers who charge a commission, others may be bought through banks\nwhich may not charge a commission. Others, like certain U.S. bonds, are not\ntraded on the open market, but may only be bought from, or redeemed by, the\nissuer or its agents. The agents, in the latter case, may or may not be\nentitled to compensation. Some securities may be bought and sold, or redeemed, at face value, with or without accrued interest; other transactions may involve\ndiscounts from face value, or premiums; interest may be receivable periodically\non some securities, on others the interest may merely accrue and be reflected\nin increased redemption values, etc. The elements to be accounted for, some or\nall of which will occur in every investment transaction, are summarized as\nfollows: (a) Acquisition of\ninvestment.
