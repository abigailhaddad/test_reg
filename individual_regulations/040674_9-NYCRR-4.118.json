I. INTEGRATED ENERGY RESOURCE PLAN\nThe integrated energy resource plan, and updates thereof, to be issued jointly by the Commissioner of the State Energy Office, the\nchairman of the Department of Public Service and the Commissioner of the\n\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation pursuant to this Executive Order, shall include the following: a. demand\nforecasts for electricity, gas, coal and petroleum products, including\ntransportation fuels, over forecast periods of not less than 15 years, for the\nservice areas of the State's major electric and gas utilities and/or for the\n\nState as a whole, as appropriate, taking into account reasonably expected\nchanges in demographic and economic activity and other similar factors, and\nenergy conservation, load management and other demand-reducing measures\nreasonably expected to occur which will affect future end- use energy\nrequirements over the forecast periods; b. energy supply requirements needed to\nsatisfy forecasted demand for electricity, gas, coal and petroleum products, including transportation fuels, for the service areas of the State's major\nelectric and gas utilities and for the State as a whole, as appropriate, over\nthe forecast periods, including with respect to electricity, the amount of\ncapacity needed to provide adequate reserve margins and the amount of electric\nenergy needed to compensate for transmission and distribution losses, and to\nmeet out-of-state sales commitments and internal use and, with respect to gas, the amount of gas needed to compensate for lost and unaccounted for gas, and to\nmeet out-of-state sales commitments and internal use; c. assessments of the ability of the existing\nenergy supply sources and the existing transmission or fuel transportation\nsystems, to satisfy, together with those sources or systems reasonably certain\nto be available, the resource supply requirements for electricity, gas, coal\nand petroleum products, including transportation fuels, over the forecast\nperiods; d. projections of energy\nprices over the forecast periods; e. identification of the extent to which\nadditional energy conservation, load-management and other demand-reducing\nmeasures can be achieved over the forecast periods beyond those measures whose\nimpact has been incorporated into the demand forecasts for electricity, gas, coal and petroleum products, including transportation fuels; f. identification of the reasonable\nalternative energy supply sources which can become available over the forecast\nperiods beyond those identified in subparagraph c above; g. analysis of the costs, risks, benefits and\nuncertainties of alternative energy supply sources and additional\ndemand-reducing measures for satisfying resource supply requirements over the\nforecast periods which are not reasonably certain to be met by the energy\nsupply sources included in the assessment under subparagraph c above. This\nanalysis shall include an analysis of the environmental impacts of the\nalternative means of addressing increased transportation demands and mitigation\nmeasures available to minimize potential adverse impacts, including further\ndiversification of transportation fuels, mass transportation options and\nalternative automotive engine design technology; and a specific analysis of the\nenvironmental impacts of alternative electricity supply scenarios, including\nenergy generated from resource recovery, and mitigation measures available to\nminimize potential adverse impacts; h. a statement of energy policies and\nlong-range energy planning objectives and strategies appropriate to achieve, among other things, the least cost integration of energy supply sources and\ndemand-reducing measures for satisfying resource supply requirements, giving\ndue regard to such factors as security and diversity of fuel supplies and\ngenerating modes, protection of public health and safety, preservation and\nenhancement of the environment, and conservation of energy and energy\nresources; i. recommendations, as\nappropriate and desirable, for administrative and legislative actions to\nimplement such policies, objectives and strategies; j. an analysis of the probable impacts of the\nimplementation of such recommendations upon economic development within the\n\nState, consumer energy costs, specifically including low-income consumers, the\nhealth, safety and welfare of the people of the State, and the quality of the\n\nState's environment; k. an\nidentification and analysis of emerging trends related to energy supply, price\nand demand; and l. such other information as is deemed appropriate. II. ENERGY PLANNING PROCESS\na. The staffs of the State Energy Office, the\n\nDepartment of Public Service and the Department of Environmental Conservation\nshall consult regularly among themselves in connection with the development of\nthe integrated energy resource plan, and updates thereof. The staffs shall seek\nto maximize input from other State departments, agencies and authorities, as\nwell as other private and public entities, with respect to assumptions and\nalternate resource supply scenarios analyzed in the development of the\nintegrated energy resource plan, consistent with the need to issue a plan and\nupdates thereto within the specified time frames; b. The commissioner of the State Energy\n\nOffice, the chairman of the Department of Public Service and the Commissioner\nof the Department of Environmental Conservation shall meet and confer as\nnecessary to issue the first integrated energy resource plan pursuant to this\n\nExecutive Order on or about July 31, 1989. At least 90 days prior to its\nissuance a draft plan, including accompanying environmental reports, shall be\nmade publicly available for comment. Public hearings shall be held in\nconnection therewith not sooner than 30 days after the issuance of such\nmaterials for public comment; and c. After the issuance of an integrated energy\nresource plan pursuant to this Executive Order, the State Energy Office, the\n\nDepartment of Public Service and the Department of Environmental Conservation\nshall initiate a review of such plan in such fashion as shall enable an update\nto be issued no later than two years after the issuance of the prior plan. The\nreview and update of the plan may be undertaken within a shorter time frame\nupon the agreement of the commissioner of the State Energy Office, the chairman\nof the Department of Public Service and the commissioner of the Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation. Issuance of an initial update, and succeeding\nupdates, shall proceed in accordance with the provisions of this Executive\n\nOrder. III. STATE\nACTIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PLAN\na. The\n\nPublic Service Commission shall give due deference to the findings contained in\nthe most recent integrated energy resource plan with respect to demand\nforecasts, energy supply requirements, energy supply assessments and energy\nprice forecasts, and the policies and long-range energy planning objectives and\nstrategies, in each of its energy-related decisions or programs; b. The Department of Public Service, the\n\nState Energy Office and the Department of Environmental Conservation shall\nimmediately provide, through a memorandum of understanding or other appropriate\nmeans, for the effective coordination of efforts to assure that the first\nutility bidding programs receive as much guidance as possible, consistent with\ntheir timely implementation, from the initial stages of the planning process. The Department of Public Service, the State Energy Office and the Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation shall further provide, through memoranda of\nunderstanding or other appropriate means, for coordinating the effective\nintegration of the findings, policies and long-range energy planning objectives\nand strategies contained in the plan, and its updates, with the Department of\n\nPublic Service's further efforts with respect to utility bidding programs and\nwith respect to other efforts undertaken to implement laws and programs\npursuant to the Public Service Commission's jurisdiction, including but not\nlimited to proceedings pursuant to Article VII of the Public Service Law, such\nother approval or permitting proceedings as shall be applicable to the\nconstruction or operation of electric generating facilities, proceedings for\nthe determination of long-run avoided costs, and proceedings with respect to\nutility demand-side management programs. c.
