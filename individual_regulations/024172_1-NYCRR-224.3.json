(2)\n\nGasoline-alcohol\nblends. (i) Gasoline-ethanol blends greater\nthan 15 percent by volume and less than 51 percent by volume ethanol are\nprohibited. Only gasoline-butanol blends may contain 16 percent alcohol by\nvolume. (ii)\n\nWhen methanol is\nblended with gasoline in quantities greater than three-tenths (0.3) percent by\nvolume, the finished blend shall contain at least an equal amount of butanol or\nhigher molecular weight alcohol, or other approved co-solvent.

All blends of ethanol flex fuel shall meet the following\nrequirements: (1)\n\nEthanol flex fuels\ncontaining 51 to 83 percent ethanol by volume shall meet the requirements in\nASTM D5798-21. (2)\n\nEthanol flex\nfuels containing more than 10 percent but not greater than 15 percent ethanol\nby volume shall meet the requirements in ASTM D4814-24a. (f) Butanol. All butanol intended for blending with gasoline shall meet\nthe requirements in ASTM D7862-21. (g) Butanol blends. Blends of butanol and gasoline that contain less than or\nequal to 16 percent butanol by volume, shall meet the requirements in ASTM\nD4814-24a. (h) Biodiesel. All biodiesel intended for blending with diesel fuel shall\nmeet the requirements in ASTM D6751-24. (i) Biodiesel blends. All blends of biodiesel and diesel fuel shall meet the\nfollowing requirements: (1)\n\nBlends\nthat contain 5 percent or less biodiesel by volume shall meet the requirements\nin ASTM D975-24a. (2)\n\nBlends that\ncontain more than 5 percent biodiesel by volume but 20 percent or less\nbiodiesel by volume shall meet the requirements in ASTM D7467-23. (3)\n\nWhen blends that contain more than 20\npercent biodiesel are offered for sale, the diesel fuel used in the blend shall\nmeet ASTM D975-24a and the biodiesel blend stock shall meet ASTM\nD6751-24.

Tit. 1\n§\n224.3\n\nAmended\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 20, 2019/Volume XLI, Issue 47, eff. 11/20/2019\n\nAmended\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register April 23, 2025/Volume XLVII, Issue 16, eff. 4/23/2025\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. The following products when sold, offered for sale or when used in this State shall meet the following requirements: (a) Automotive gasoline. All automotive gasoline shall meet the requirements in\nASTM\nD 4814-18a, except as noted below. (1)\n\nVapor pressure. Vapor pressure standards set forth in 6 NYCRR Subpart\n225-3, or exceptions granted thereto by the\n\nCommissioner\nof Environmental Conservation, shall supersede those in this section. (2)\n\nGasoline-alcohol blends. (i) Gasoline-ethanol blends greater than 15 percent by volume and less than 51 percent by volume ethanol are prohibited. Only gasoline-butanol blends may contain 16 percent alcohol by volume. (ii)\n\nWhen methanol is blended with gasoline in quantities greater than three-tenths (0.3) percent by volume, the finished blend shall contain at least an equal amount of butanol or higher molecular weight alcohol, or other approved\nco-solvent. The maximum methanol content of any gasoline shall not exceed five percent by volume. (3)\n\nMotor octane number.
