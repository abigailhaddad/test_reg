  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1200.5.8 - Contractual relationship between lawyers and nonlegal professionals\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The practice of law has an essential tradition of complete independence and\nuncompromised loyalty to those it serves. Recognizing this tradition, clients\nof lawyers practicing in New York State are guaranteed \"independent\nprofessional judgment and undivided loyalty uncompromised by conflicts of\ninterest.\" Indeed, these guarantees represent the very foundation of the\nprofession and allow and foster its continued role as a protector of the system\nof law. Therefore, a lawyer must remain completely responsible for his or her\nown independent professional judgment, maintain the confidences and secrets of\nclients, preserve funds of clients and third parties in his or her control, and\notherwise comply with the legal and ethical principles governing lawyers in New\n\nYork State. Multi-disciplinary practice between\nlawyers and nonlawyers is incompatible with the core values of the legal\nprofession and therefore, a strict division between services provided by\nlawyers and those provided by nonlawyers is essential to protect those values. However, a lawyer or law firm may enter into and maintain a contractual\nrelationship with a nonlegal professional or nonlegal professional service firm\nfor the purpose of offering to the public, on a systematic and continuing\nbasis, legal services performed by the lawyer or law firm as well as other\nnonlegal professional services, notwithstanding the provisions of Rule 1.7(a), provided that: (1)\nthe\nprofession of the nonlegal professional or nonlegal professional service firm\nis included in a list jointly established and maintained by the Appellate\n\nDivisions pursuant to Section\n1205.3\nof the Joint Appellate\n\nDivision Rules; (2)\nthe lawyer or law firm neither grants to the nonlegal professional or nonlegal\nprofessional service firm, nor permits such person or firm to obtain, hold or\nexercise, directly or indirectly, any ownership or investment interest in, or\nmanagerial or supervisory right, power or position in connection with the\npractice of law by the lawyer or law firm, nor, as provided in Rule 7.2(a)(1), shares legal fees with a nonlawyer or receives or gives any monetary or other\ntangible benefit for giving or receiving a referral; and\n(3)\nthe fact that the\ncontractual relationship exists is disclosed by the lawyer or law firm to any\nclient of the lawyer or law firm before the client is referred to the nonlegal\nprofessional service firm, or to any client of the nonlegal professional\nservice firm before that client receives legal services from the lawyer or law\nfirm; and the client has given informed written consent and has been provided\nwith a copy of the \"Statement of Client's Rights In Cooperative Business\n\nArrangements\" pursuant to section\n1205.4\nof the Joint Appellate\n\nDivisions Rules. (b) For purposes of paragraph (a): (1)\neach profession on the\nlist maintained pursuant to a Joint Rule of the Appellate Divisions shall have\nbeen designated sua sponte, or approved by the Appellate Divisions upon\napplication of a member of a nonlegal profession or nonlegal professional\nservice firm, upon a determination that the profession is composed of\nindividuals who, with respect to their profession: (i) have been awarded a bachelor's\ndegree or its equivalent from an accredited college or university, or have\nattained an equivalent combination of educational credit from such a college or\nuniversity and work experience; (ii)\nare licensed to practice the\nprofession by an agency of the State of New York or the United States\n\nGovernment; and\n(iii)\nare required under penalty of\nsuspension or revocation of license to adhere to a code of ethical conduct that\nis reasonably comparable to that of the legal profession; (2)\nthe term \"ownership or\ninvestment interest\" shall mean any such interest in any form of debt or\nequity, and shall include any interest commonly considered to be an interest\naccruing to or enjoyed by an owner or investor. (c) This Rule shall not apply\nto relationships consisting solely of non-exclusive reciprocal referral\nagreements or understandings between a lawyer or law firm and a nonlegal\nprofessional or nonlegal professional service firm.
