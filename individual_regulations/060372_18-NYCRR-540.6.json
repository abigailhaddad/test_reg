(e) (1)\n\nAs\na condition of payment, all providers of medical assistance must take\nreasonable measures to ascertain the legal liability of third parties to pay\nfor medical care and services. (2)\n\nNo claim for reimbursement shall be submitted unless the provider has: (i) investigated to find third-party\nresources in the same manner and to the same extent as the provider would to\nascertain the existence of third-party resources for individuals for whom\nreimbursement is not available under the medical assistance program; and\n(ii)\nsought reimbursement from\nliable third parties. (3)\n\nEach medical assistance provider shall: (i) request the medical assistance recipient\nor his representatives to inform the provider of any resources available to pay\nfor medical care and services; (ii)\nmake claims against all resources indicated on a Medicaid identification card\nor communicated to the provider via the electronic Medicaid eligibility\nverification system, via the medical assistance information and payment system\n(MMIS) toll-free inquiry telephone number of via the MMIS transaction telephone\nsystem, and all resources which the provider has discovered, prior to\nsubmission of any claim to the medical assistance program; (iii)\ncontinue investigation and attempts to\nrecover from potential third-party resources after submission of a claim to the\nmedical assistance program to at least the same extent that such investigations\nand attempts would occur in the absence of reimbursement by the medical\nassistance program; (iv)\nif the\nprovider is informed of the potential existence of any third-party resources by\nan official of the medical assistance program, or by any other person who can\nreasonably be presumed to have knowledge of a probable source of third-party\nresources, investigate the possibility of making a claim to the liable third\nparty and make such claim as is reasonably appropriate; and\n(v) take any other reasonable measures\nnecessary to assure that no claims are submitted to the medical assistance\nprogram that could be submitted to another source of reimbursement. (4)\n\nAny reimbursement the provider\nrecovers from liable third parties shall be applied to reduce any claims for\nmedical assistance submitted for payment to the medical assistance program by\nsuch provider or shall be repaid to the medical assistance program within 30\ndays after third-party liability has been ascertained; when a claim has been\nsubmitted to a third party whose liability was ascertained after submission of\na claim to the medical assistance program the provider must make reimbursement\nto the medical assistance program within 30 days after the receipt of\nreimbursement by the provider from a liable third party. (5)\nA provider of medical assistance shall\nnot deny care or services to a medical assistance recipient because of the\nexistence of a third-party resource to which a claim for payment may be\nsubmitted in accordance with this subdivision. (6)\nA provider of medical assistance must\nreview and examine information relating to available health insurance and other\npotential third-party resources for each medical assistance recipient to\ndetermine if a health insurance identification card or any other information\nindicates that prior or other approval is required for nonemergency, post-emergency, nonmaternity, hospital, physician or other medical care, services or supplies. If approval is required as a condition of payment or\nreimbursement by an insurance carrier or other liable third party, the provider\nmust obtain for the recipient, or ensure that the recipient has obtained, any\nnecessary approval prior to submitting any claims for reimbursement from the\nmedical assistance program. The provider must comply with all Medicare or other\nthird-party billing requirements and must accept assignment of the recipient's\nright to receive payment or must acquire any other rights of the recipient\nnecessary to ensure that no reimbursement is made by the medical assistance\nprogram when the costs of medical care, services or supplies could be borne by\na liable third party. If a provider fails to comply with these conditions, any\nreimbursement received from the medical assistance program in violation of the\nprovisions of this paragraph must be repaid to the medical assistance program\nby such provider. No repayment will be required if the provider can produce\nacceptable documentation to the department that the provider reasonably\nattempted to ascertain and satisfy any conditions of approval or other claiming\nrequirements of liable third-party payors in the same manner and to the same\nextent as the provider would for individuals for whom reimbursement is not\navailable under the medical assistance program, as described in paragraphs (1)\nthrough (5) of this subdivision,. (7)\nA provider of medical assistance who\nbecomes aware, or reasonably should have become aware, of available health\ninsurance or other potential third party resources that can be claimed from a\nliable third party by the provider as an agent of a social services official in\naccordance with the provisions of Part 542 of this Title, must submit a claim\nfor such payment to the liable third party in the manner described in Part 542, except that a provider will not be required to submit such a claim to a liable\nthird party when the claim is for prenatal care for pregnant women or\npreventive pediatric services (including early and periodic screening, diagnosis and treatment services). If a provider fails to submit such a claim\nas required by this paragraph, reimbursement for such claim will not be made by\nthe medical assistance program and any reimbursement received in violation of\nthe provisions of this paragraph must be repaid to the medical assistance\nprogram by such provider. If a provider has satisfied the requirements\ndescribed in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this subdivision, no repayment will\nbe required if the provider can produce documentation acceptable to the\ndepartment that the provider reasonably attempted to ascertain whether such\nclaim could be submitted in the manner described in Part 542 of this Title. If\na provider submits a claim in accordance with the provisions of Part 542 of\nthis Title and all or a portion of such claim is rejected by the liable third\nparty through no fault of the provider, that portion of the claim that is so\nrejected may be submitted to the medical assistance program for\npayment.
