Tit. 9 § 3.96 - Executive order no. 96: creating the new york state council on housing and community development\n\nState Regulations\n\nThere are in the State of New York a number of public\nagencies which have been created to encourage and assist in community\ndevelopment activities and to provide safe, sanitary and adequate housing for\npersons and families of low or moderate income by developing, financing, preserving, maintaining and supervising such housing. These agencies include\nthe New York State Housing Finance Agency, the New York State Project Finance\n\nAgency, the New York State Urban Development Corporation and its subsidiary, the Mortgage Loan Enforcement and Administration Corporation, the State of New\n\nYork Mortgage Agency, the New York State Department of State, and the New York\n\nState Division of Housing and Community Renewal (herein collectively referred\nto as the \"agencies\").
