One way for parties to express their consent to this accelerated\nadjudication process is by using specific language in a contract, such as: \"Subject to the requirements for a case to be heard in the Commercial Division, the parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Commercial\n\nDivision, New York State Supreme Court and to the application of the Court's\naccelerated procedures, in connection with any dispute, claim or controversy\narising out of or relating to this agreement, or the breach, termination, enforcement or validity thereof.\"\n(b) In any matter proceeding through the\naccelerated process, all pre-trial proceedings, including all discovery, pre-trial motions and mandatory mediation, shall be completed and the parties\nshall be ready for trial within nine months from the date of filing of a\n\nRequest of Judicial Intervention (RJI). (c) In any accelerated action, the court\nshall deem the parties to have irrevocably waived: (1)\nany objections based on lack of\npersonal jurisdiction or the doctrine of forum non conveniens; (2)\nthe right to trial by\njury; (3)\nthe right\nto recover punitive or exemplary damages; (4)\nthe right to any interlocutory\nappeal; and\n(5)\nthe\nright to discovery, except to such discovery as the parties might otherwise\nagree or as follows: (i) there\nshall be no more than seven interrogatories and five requests to\nadmit; (ii)\nabsent a\nshowing of good cause, there shall be no more than seven discovery depositions\nper side with no deposition to exceed seven hours in length.

(d) In any accelerated action, the\ndescription of custodians shall be narrowly tailored to include only those\nindividuals whose electronic documents may reasonably be expected to contain\nevidence that is material to the dispute. In other respects, electronic\ndiscovery shall proceed as set forth in Rule 11-c. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\nr. 202.70.9.
