  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 670.6 - End stage renal dialysis service\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This\nmethodology will be utilized in the evaluation of certificate of need\napplications involving the construction or establishment of new or replacement\ndialysis stations used in the treatment of end stage renal disease. It is the\nintent of the Public Health Council that this methodology, when used in\nconjunction with the planning standards and criteria set forth in section\n670.1\nof this Part, become a\nstatement of basic principles and planning/decisionmaking tools for guiding and\ndirecting the development of dialysis stations for end stage renal disease\nservices throughout the State. Additionally, it is intended that the\nmethodology will provide the health systems agencies and potential applicants\nwith sufficient flexibility to consider the unique characteristics of their\nrespective areas in determining need. The goals and objectives of the\nmethodology expressed herein are expected to ensure that an adequate supply of\ndialysis stations are available to provide access to care to all those in need\nof in-facility dialysis. (b) The\nfactors to be considered in determining the public need for dialysis stations\nshall include, but not be limited to, the following: (1)\nevidence that the proposed dialysis\nservices capacity proposed will be utilized sufficiently to be financially\nfeasible as demonstrated by a five-year analysis of projected costs and\nrevenues associated with the program; (2)\nevidence that the proposed service or\nadditional capacity will enhance access to services by patients including\nmembers of medically underserved groups which have traditionally experienced\ndifficulties in obtaining equal access to health services (for example, low-income persons, racial and ethnic minorities, women and handicapped\npersons), and/or appropriate rural populations; (3)\nevidence that the facilities hours of\noperation and admission policies will promote the availability of services\nwhich are acceptable to those in need of such services, in particular, operational hours that permit individuals in dialysis to continue\nemployment; (4)\nthe facility's\nwillingness and ability safely to serve dialysis patients; and\n(5)\nevidence, derived from analysis of\nfactors including, but not necessarily limited to, patient referral and use\npatterns of existing dialysis facilities and services and projected referral\nand use patterns of both the proposed facility, and of existing facilities or\nservices within the applicant's planning area which would result from approval\nof the proposed facility, indicating that approval of the proposed facility\nwill not jeopardize the quality of services provided at or the financial\nviability of such existing facilities or services. However, a finding that the\nproposed facility will jeopardize the financial viability of one or more\nexisting facilities will not of itself require a recommendation of disapproval\nof the proposed application. (c) Public need for a proposed facility or\nstation shall be deemed to exist, when review and consideration of evidence\nconcerning each of the five factors set forth in subdivision (b) of this\nsection results in an affirmative finding. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n670.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
