  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 4-5.15 - Low water cutoffs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Devices required. Each automatically fired steam or vapor system boiler, regardless of date of installation, and each automatically fired hot water\nboiler installed after January 1, 1966, shall be equipped with an automatic low\nwater fuel cutoff, so located as to automatically cut off the fuel supply when\nthe surface of the water falls to the lowest safe water line. If a water\nfeeding device is installed, it shall be so constructed that the water inlet\nvalve cannot feed water into the boiler through the float chamber and it shall\nbe so located as to supply the requisite feedwater. The lowest safe water line\nshall be not lower than the lowest visible part of the water glass. (b) Attachment. Such a fuel or feedwater\ncontrol device may be attached direct to a boiler, or to the tapped openings\nprovided for attaching a water glass direct to a boiler, provided that such\nconnections from the boiler are nonferrous tees or Y's not less than 1/2 inch\npipe size between the boiler and the water glass, so that the water glass is\nattached direct and as close as possible to the boiler. The straightway tapping\nof the Y or tee shall take the water glass fittings, and the side outlet of the\nY or tee shall take the fuel cutoff or the water feeding device. The ends of\nall nipples shall be reamed to full-size diameter. (c) Drain pipe. Designs embodying a float and\nfloat bowl shall have a vertical straightway valved drain pipe at the lowest\npoint in the water equalizing pipe connections by which the bowl and the\nequalizing pipe can be flushed and the device tested. (d) Boilers consisting of continuous piping\naffording no reservoir or water level practicable for the operation of a low\nwater cutoff may be equipped with a flow valve or other suitable control which\nhas been tested and approved in accordance with a code or standard commonly\napplied in the industry, e.g., AGA or UL. (e) Heat generating apparatus shall be\nregarded as a new installation and subject to all applicable provisions\nrelating to installations made after January 1, 1966 whenever both an existing\nburner and controls are replaced by a new burner and controls.
