  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 220.11 - File Retention\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Ensuring accurate recordkeeping procedures are in place is essential to\nmaintaining the integrity of the FRP. Therefore, whenever an incarcerated\nindividual transfers to a facility that has the Family Reunion Program, the FRP\nORC at the sending facility will forward the FRP file to the FRP ORC at the\nreceiving facility. In maintaining this chain of custody, the sending FRP ORC\nwill confirm this transaction via a chronological entry in the Guidance and\n\nCounseling folder. The receiving FRP ORC will acknowledge receipt of the file\nvia a chronological entry in the Guidance and Counseling folder. If the incarcerated individual is transferred to a facility\nthat does not have the Family Reunion Program, the sending facility will ensure\nthat a copy of every central office decision, whether approved or denied, is\nfiled in the program services section of the incarcerated individual's guidance\nfile. The entire FRP file will be maintained at the participating FRP site for\nseven years from the date of the last FRP visit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n220.11\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register August 4, 2021/Volume XLIII, Issue 31, eff. 8/4/2021\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
