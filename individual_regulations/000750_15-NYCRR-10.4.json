(d) The sponsor must not disclose or\notherwise make available to any person or entity any personal information, as\ndefined in Article 12-D of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, obtained by such\nprovider about any student who registers for such course. The sponsor must also\nadhere to the Department's policies regarding the protection and non-disclosure\nof students' personal information. (e) An applicant must demonstrate that the\ninternet pre-licensing course can validate: (1)\n\nStudent identity at registration and\nthroughout the course; (2)\n\nParticipation throughout the course; (3)\n\nThat the time requirements of the course\nare met; and\n(4)\n\nThat the student\nsuccessfully completed the course. (f) Applicants may apply to become sponsors\nimmediately upon the date this Part takes effect. No course will be approved\nuntil the completed application is received, reviewed by the Department, and a\ndetermination to approve the application has been made. (g) An application to administer the internet\npre-licensing course may be denied if adverse material is uncovered during the\napplication review process indicating that the sponsor is not of the high moral\nand financial character required to operate an internet course. (h) For an application to be approved by the\n\nCommissioner: (1)\n\nApplicants must establish\nthat the proposed sponsor owns or has a right to use all aspects of the\ninternet pre-licensing course that they plan to deliver in New York State (e.g. if using proprietary biometric technology to validate identity and\nparticipation, sponsor must provide evidence that the sponsor has rights to use\nthat proprietary technology for this purpose). Once approved, that internet\npre-licensing course may not be delivered in New York State by any other\nsponsor. (2)\n\nThe course must\nprovide a minimum of two hundred seventy (270) minutes of instruction. The\ninstruction must include active learning techniques (i.e. requiring student\nparticipation). The minimum two hundred seventy (270) minutes shall only count\ntoward time spent instructing the student and shall not count toward time spent\non log-in procedures, administrative tasks, help functions, validation\nprocesses, audio/visual media download times and reading and responding to\ncontent questions. (3)\n\nThe course\nmust include all education components required under section\n502\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law and any content required by the\n\nCommissioner. (4)\n\nApplicants must\nprovide a detailed transcript of the course, including all content, sections, logical breaks, internal controls, proposed audio and video clips (including\ntime duration). Course topic sequencing may be different from the course\ncurriculum (MV-277) established by the Department as long as it does not\ndetract from the logical flow and educational value of the course. (5)\n\nApplicants must provide test questions to\nthe Commissioner. (6)\n\nThe course\nmust meet all of the technical specifications prescribed by the\n\nCommissioner. (7)\n\nApplicants must\nprovide information on when validation will occur and what validation methods\nthey propose to use. (8)\n\nApplicants\nmust submit no more than one internet pre-licensing course for approval at a\ntime. If the applicant's primary internet pre-licensing course has been\nreviewed and denied, by the Department, the applicant may submit a separate new\napplication for the revised internet pre-licensing course in accordance with\nthe standards set forth in this Part. (9)\n\nSponsors must not display advertising\nduring any part of the internet pre-licensing course, including the\nregistration, instruction, testing, validation, or completion periods, nor\nshall sponsors display any distracting material that is not related to the\ntopic being presented. (10)\n\nApplicants must provide the Department with appropriate access to the course\nfor the purposes of reviewing the materials and internal controls. Sponsors\nmust obtain approval of all changes to course material in accordance with the\nchange control requirements of this Part, prior to implementation by the\nsponsor. Once changes are approved, the sponsor must provide a new course\ntranscript to be used in the monitoring of the course. (11)\n\nApplicants must provide the following: (i) A non-refundable application fee of seven\nthousand five hundred dollars ($7,500.00) must be submitted with each\napplication in the form of a certified check. (ii)\n\nAn initial bond, or a letter of credit, separate and apart from any bond or letter of credit required under Part 141 of\nthe Commissioner's Regulations, in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars\n($100,000.00) naming the Department as the beneficiary, which would be paid to\nthe sponsor in the event of a security or data breach or to the Department in\nthe event the sponsor ceases doing business in NYS during the pilot period, and/or to reimburse fees paid by students in cases where the sponsor is unable\nto provide the course. Payment of the bond must not be contingent upon\nsponsor's approval. Applicants need not provide the bond or letter of credit\nwith their initial application materials, though this requirement must be\nsatisfied before the Department will grant final approval to conduct an\ninternet pre-licensing course. The sponsor must then submit the bond or letter\nof credit in order to be finally approved. The Department will notify the\nsponsor when course delivery may commence. The sponsors must submit proof of\nbond renewal on an annual basis. (i) Disqualifying application information. (1)\n\nAn application will be denied or prior\napproval will be suspended or revoked if any manager, owner, operator, officer, partner, or employee of the sponsor has been convicted of a felony or any other\ncrime involving fraudulent activity. At the discretion of the Department, after\na review of the felony or any other crime and the factors that lead to any such\nconviction, the Department may issue a waiver. (2)\n\nIf it is established that any information\nprovided in the application is fraudulent, the application will be denied, or, if previously approved, sponsor approval will be revoked. In either case, the\napplicant will not be permitted to file an application for ten (10) years from\nthe date of denial or revocation. (j) Non-transferability. Sponsor approval to\nconduct an internet pre-licensing course is not transferable under any\ncircumstances. Both the sponsor approval and internet pre-licensing course\napproval are tied directly to the sponsor business named on the application\nform, including all ownership information. An organization that acquires\nanother sponsor's course must submit an application and seek approval in\naccordance with the standards set forth in this Part. (k) Change of officers, contact persons, contact information or address.

(2)\n\nSponsors must notify\nthe Department in writing within ten (10) days of any changes in any owners, operators, managers, partners, officers, directors, or controlling shareholders\nof the sponsor. (3)\n\nFailure to\nnotify the Department of such changes shall be grounds for immediate suspension\nof sponsor approval. (4)\n\nTransfer\nof ownership will require the new owner(s) to file a new application with the\n\nDepartment in accordance with the eligibility requirement and approval\nstandards set forth in this section. The transferred course may not be\ndelivered until the Commissioner has approved the new application.
