  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 107.7 - Erroneous refund\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For\npurposes of section\n683 (c)(5)\nand section\n684 (j)\nof the Tax Law, the\nterm erroneous refund means a refund which is issued as a result of an error\nmade by an employee of the Department of Taxation and Finance, including an\nerror made in an audit of a New York State income tax return. However, a refund\nin the amount requested by a taxpayer on a New York State income tax return, including a refund of such amount issued after verification of such return for\na mathematical error by an employee of the department, is not an erroneous\nrefund as defined in this subdivision, up to or in any part of the amount\nclaimed, since such refund is issued relying entirely on the claims made\ntherein by the taxpayer. (b) Examples of the application of the erroneous refund concept under subdivision\n(a) of this section include, but are not limited to, the following: Example 1:Taxpayer A claims a New York itemized deduction\nof $6,900 on A's 1987 New York State personal income tax return. Upon\nprocessing, the itemized deduction claimed is entered on the Department's\ncomputer as $9,600 and the Department increases the refund requested by A. At a\nlater date, within the statute of limitations under section\n683\nof the Tax Law, the Department discovers\nits error and issues a deficiency for the portion of the refund issued in\nerror. Since such portion of the refund previously issued occurred as a result\nof an error made by an employee of the Department, such portion is an erroneous\nrefund and interest will not be imposed on the deficiency pursuant to section\n684 (m)\nof the Tax Law where\nsuch deficiency is paid within the time prescribed. Example 2:Taxpayer C files a timely 1987 New York State\npersonal income tax return requesting a refund. C receives a refund in the\namount requested. Upon audit, within the statute of limitations under section\n683\nof the Tax Law, an item claimed on such\nreturn is disallowed and a deficiency for additional New York State personal\nincome tax due is issued. Since the Department relied entirely on the claims\nmade by C on the New York State personal income tax return in issuing the\nrefund in the amount requested by C, such refund is not an erroneous refund and\ninterest will be computed on the additional New York State personal income tax\ndue pursuant to section\n684 (a)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw.
