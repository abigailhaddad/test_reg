  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5317.38 - Voucher validation system requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Voucher validation system. A voucher\nvalidation system may be integrated entirely into a MCS or exist as an entirely\nseparate system. (b) Payment by\nvoucher printer. Payment by voucher printer as a method of credit redemption on\na gaming device is permissible only when the gaming device is linked to an\napproved validation system or MCS that allows validation of the printed\nvoucher. Validation information shall come from the validation system or MCS\nusing a secure communication protocol. For support of offline voucher issuance, the gaming device shall be linked to an approved validation system or MCS that\nallows validation of the printed voucher, but does not have to be in constant\ncommunication for the issuance of voucher to be permissible. (c) Voucher Issuance. The voucher validation\nsystem shall be able to communicate the following voucher data to the gaming\ndevice to print on the voucher: (1)\ngaming\nfacility name and site identifier; (2)\nindication of an expiration period from\nthe date of issuance, or the date and time the voucher will expire (24-hour\nformat that is understood by the local date and time format), if\napplicable; (3)\nsystem date and\ntime (24-hour format that is understood by the local date and time format); and\n(4)\nvoucher validation number\nfor the gaming device to generate the validation number. (d) Algorithm for generating voucher\nvalidation numbers or seeds. (1)\n\nSystem\nvalidation. The algorithm or method used by the validation system or MCS to\ngenerate the voucher validation number shall guarantee an insignificant\npercentage of repetitive validation numbers. (2)\n\nGaming-device-generated validation number\n(system seed). The validation system shall send a unique seed to the gaming\ndevice upon enrolling the gaming device as voucher-printing-capable. The system\nsubsequently may send a new seed to the gaming device after a voucher is\nprinted. The algorithm or methods used to determine the seed shall guarantee an\ninsignificant percentage of repetitive validation numbers. (e) Algorithm for generating offline voucher\nauthentication identifiers. If supported, the offline authentication identifier\nshall be of a unique value that is derived by a hash, or other secure\nencryption method of at least 128 bits, that uniquely will identify the wager\ninstrument, verify that the redeeming system was also the issuing system and\nvalidate the amount of the voucher. The following minimum set of input shall be\nused to create the authentication identifier: (1)\nslot machine identifier; (2)\nvalidation number; (3)\nvoucher amount; and\n(4)\nsecure seed, key, etc. provided by the\nvalidation system or MCS to the gaming device. (i) Secure seeds, keys, etc. as assigned\nshall be sufficiently random. Measures to avoid predictability will be reviewed\nby the licensed independent testing laboratory pursuant to Part 5318 of this\n\nSubchapter on a case-by-case basis. (ii)\n\nThe minimum length for any secure seeds, keys, etc. employed by the validation system or MCS shall be chosen from a pool\nof the variable type specified by the communication protocol used. The pool\nshall comprise at least 10 to the power of 14 randomly distributed\nvalues. (f) System voucher records. (1)\n\nThe validation\nsystem shall retrieve the voucher information correctly based on the secure\ncommunication protocol implemented and store the voucher information into a\ndatabase. (2)\n\nThe voucher record on\nthe host system shall contain at a minimum the following voucher information: (i) validation number; (ii)\ndate and time the gaming device printed\nthe voucher (24-hour format that is understood by the local date and time\nformat); (iii)\ntype of transaction\nor other method of differentiating voucher types (assuming multiple voucher\ntypes are available); (iv)\nnumeric\nvalue of voucher in dollars and cents; (v) status of voucher (i.e., valid, unredeemed, pending, void, invalid, redemption in progress, redeemed, etc.); (vi)\ndate and time the\nvoucher will expire (24-hour format that is understood by the local date and\ntime format or expiration period from date of issuance), if\napplicable; (vii)\n\nMachine number\n(or cashier or change booth location number, if voucher creation outside the\ngaming device is supported) that identifies the location from which the voucher\nwas issued. (g) System requirements for offline ticketing\nsupport. Offline ticketing shall: (1)\nsupport\nthe identification and redemption of offline vouchers through a system provided\napplication; (2)\nlog all access and\noperations of users of the application described in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision for 14 days through archived data or restoration from backup where\nmaintaining such data on a live database is deemed inappropriate; (3)\nthe validation system or MCS shall set a\nmaximum expiration length of no more than 30 gaming days for all provided and\nstill-unused validation numbers and seed, key, etc. values; (4)\nexpired validation numbers and seed, key, etc. values shall be discarded in a way that prevents the re-use of unique\ncombinations of validation numbers and seed, key, etc. values for a sufficient\nperiod of time on the system. (h) Voucher printing during loss of\ncommunication with validation system. For validation systems that communicate\nto a gaming device through an interface board (also called a system machine\ninterface board), if any links between the interface board and the MCS database\ngo down, the interface board shall: (1)\nnot\nrespond to the validation request from the gaming device and stop voucher\nprinting; (2)\nprevent the gaming\ndevice from further voucher issuance; and\n(3)\nnot read or store any further voucher\ninformation generated by the gaming device. A maximum of two vouchers directly after loss of\ncommunication is acceptable, in cases where the interface element already has\nbeen seeded by the system, so long as the voucher issuance information is sent\nimmediately, when communication is reestablished. (i) Online voucher redemption. Vouchers can\nbe redeemed at a gaming device, cashier or change booths or other approved\nvalidation terminals (kiosks), so long as such locations are enrolled for\nvoucher validation with a validation system. (1)\n\nThe validation system shall process\nvoucher redemption correctly according to the secure communication protocol\nimplemented; (2)\n\nThe validation\nsystem shall update the voucher status on the database during each phase of the\nredemption process accordingly, so that whenever the voucher status changes, the system updates the database. Upon each status change, the database shall\nindicate the following information: (i) date\nand time of status change; (ii)\nvoucher status; (iii)\nvoucher\nvalue; (iv)\nmachine number or\nsource identification from where the voucher information came from. (j) Offline voucher\nredemption. If supported, offline vouchers can be redeemed at a cashier or\nchange booth, so long as such locations are enrolled for voucher validation\nwith a validation system. (1)\n\nThe validation\nsystem at a minimum shall support the identification and redemption of offline\nvouchers through a system-provided application. (2)\n\nThe validation system shall process\noffline voucher redemption correctly according to the secure communication\nprotocol implemented. (3)\n\nThe\nvalidation system shall update the voucher status on the database during each\nphase of the redemption process accordingly. In other words, whenever the\nvoucher status changes, the system shall update the database. Upon each status\nchange, the database shall indicate the following information: (i) date and time of status change; (ii)\nticket/voucher status; (iii)\nticket/voucher value; (iv)\nmachine number or source identification\nfrom where the voucher information came. (k) Cashier and change booth operation. All\nvalidation terminals shall be user-controlled and password-controlled. When a\nvoucher is presented for redemption, a cashier: (1)\nshall scan the bar code via an optical\nreader or equivalent; or\n(2)\nshall\ninput the voucher validation number manually; and\n(3)\nmay print a validation receipt, after the\nvoucher is electronically validated, if applicable. (l) Validation receipt information. Any\nvalidation receipt, at a minimum, shall contain the following printed\ninformation: (1)\nmachine number; (2)\nvalidation number; (3)\ndate and time paid; (4)\namount; and\n(5)\ncashier or change booth\nidentifier. (m) Invalid\nvoucher notification. The validation system or MCS shall have the ability to\nidentify the following occurrences and notify the cashier that one of the\nfollowing conditions exists: (1)\nvoucher\ncannot be found on file (e.g., stale date, forgery, etc.); (2)\nvoucher has already been paid; or\n(3)\namount of voucher differs\nfrom amount on file. This requirement of this paragraph can be met by display\nof the voucher amount for confirmation by cashier during the redemption\nprocess). (n) Voucher\nredemption during communication loss. If the online data system temporarily\ngoes down and validation information cannot be sent to the validation system or\nMCS, an alternate method of payment shall be provided either by the validation\nsystem possessing unique features (e.g., validity checking of voucher\ninformation in conjunction with local database storage), to identify duplicate\nvouchers and prevent fraud by reprinting and redeeming a voucher that was\npreviously issued by the gaming device; or use of an approved alternative\nmethod as designated by the commission that will accomplish the same. A maximum\nof two vouchers directly after loss of communication is acceptable, in cases\nwhere the interface element has already been seeded by the system, so long as\nthe voucher issuance information is sent immediately, when communication is\nreestablished. This subdivision does not apply to systems employing an approved\noffline voucher routine. (o) Redemption terminals (kiosks). Refer to Part 5316 for technical standards for\nredemption terminals. (p) Reporting\nrequirements. The following reports shall be generated at a minimum and\nreconciled with all validated/redeemed vouchers: (1)\nvoucher issuance report; (2)\nvoucher redemption report; (3)\nvoucher liability report; (4)\nvoucher drop variance report; (5)\ntransaction detail report, which shall be\navailable from the validation system that shows all vouchers generated by a\ngaming device and all vouchers redeemed by the validation terminal or other\ngaming device; and\n(6)\ncashier\nreport, which shall detail individual vouchers, the sum of the vouchers paid by\na cashier or change booth or redemption terminal. The requirements set forth in paragraphs (2) and (4) of\nthis subdivision shall not apply where two-part vouchers exist for the gaming\ndevice wherein the first part is dispensed as an original voucher to the patron\nand the second part remains attached to the printer mechanism as a copy (on a\ncontinuous roll) in such gaming device. (q) Database and validation component\nsecurity. Once validation information is stored in the database, such data\nshall not be altered in any way. The validation system database shall be\nencrypted or password-protected and shall possess a non-alterable user audit\ntrail to prevent unauthorized access. The normal operation of any device that\nholds voucher information shall not have any options or method that may\ncompromise voucher information. Any device that holds voucher information in\nits memory shall not allow removing of the information unless it has first\ntransferred that information to the database or other secured component, or\ncomponents, of the validation system.
