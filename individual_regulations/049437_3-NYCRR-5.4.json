Tit. 3 § 5.4 - Internal audits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The superintendent encourages all foreign bank offices to employ qualified\ninternal auditors as an important aspect of adequate internal control. The\nsuperintendent may, in his or her discretion, require a foreign bank office to\nfollow requirements similar to those set forth in paragraph (b) of this\nsection. (1)\n\nInternal auditors, whether head\noffice, resident or regional, are expected to be well-qualified to perform\ntheir duties. Qualified internal auditors should possess significant experience\nin bank accounting, auditing and control functions, and attend relevant\nprofessional education courses on an annual basis. (b) Foreign bank offices with a composite\nROC-A rating of four or worse, and an \"O\" rating of four or worse, and, on a\ncase-by-case basis as determined by the superintendent, foreign bank offices\nwith an \"O\" rating of three or worse, regardless of the composite rating, must\nhave comprehensive on-site internal audits performed annually by either the\nforeign banking corporation's head office internal auditors or foreign bank\noffice resident or regional internal auditors who report directly to the head\noffice. (1)\nA \"comprehensive internal audit\"\nshall include the performance of annual detailed internal audit procedures on\nall high risk areas which represent significant potential exposure to the\nforeign bank office. The designation of high risk areas will require the\ninternal auditor's judgment, and will be reviewed during examinations of the\noffice. (2)\n\nForeign bank office\nresident or regional internal auditors should be hired with the approval of the\nforeign banking corporation's head office and be authorized to communicate\ndirectly with the head office without any foreign bank office management\nintervention. The superintendent requires such resident or regional internal\nauditors to remain independent of foreign bank office management. (c) The superintendent may, in his\nor her discretion, require foreign bank offices subject to subdivision (b) of\nthis section to have the comprehensive on-site internal audits performed\nannually by part-time or full-time regional or resident internal auditors who\nreport directly to head office. The superintendent shall decide whether the\ninternal auditors shall be part-time or full-time, taking into consideration\nthe size and activities of the foreign bank office. Any such internal audit\nshall follow the requirements described in subdivision (b) of this section. In\naddition, at the time of each onsite examination, the foreign bank office shall\npresent to the examiner in charge the formal qualifications of the internal\nauditors and the internal auditors' actual work plan since the previous\nexamination and the internal auditors' program for the next 12 month\nperiod. (d) Reports of internal\nauditors required under this Part together with supporting workpapers must be\nin English. Workpapers shall be made available to the superintendent upon\nrequest. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n5.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
