  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 71.1 - Application\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The provisions\nof this Part shall apply to the filing, processing, hearing, consideration and\ndetermination of an appeal from minimum wage compliance orders pursuant to\narticle 19-A. (b) See Part 65 of\nthis Title for general rules of procedure and practice not specified in this\n\nPart. (c) Article 19-A provides\nthat minimum wage standards shall apply to farm workers. Minimum wage orders\nand regulations established by the Commissioner of Labor pursuant to articles\n19 and 19-A of the Labor Law are administered and enforced by the Commissioner\nof Labor through the Division of Labor standards of the Department of Labor. In\norder to effectuate those functions, the division is required to make an\ninitial determination respecting the interpretation and application of the\nprovisions of an applicable wage order and regulations. If the division\nconcludes that an employer has failed to conform with a minimum wage order or a\nregulation, or with a provision of article 19-A, it serves an order directing\nthe employer to comply therewith and, when pertinent, to make payment to the\n\nCommissioner of Labor, who will disburse according to law, any underpayment of\nwages alleged to be due to employees named in a schedule annexed to the\ncompliance order. If a party deems that such an order is incorrect, redress is\navailable by filing a petition under section 677 as prescribed in this\n\nPart. (d) The board's procedure in\nthese matters approximates that of a judicial proceeding. Customarily, a\nhearing is held at which the Commissioner of Labor, represented by counsel, appears as a defending party. The hearing is de novo (original) in nature. The\npetitioner and the Commissioner of Labor may submit oral or documentary\nevidence which is material and relevant to the issues. The board will not take\ncognizance of any evidence submitted to any unit or division of the Department\nof Labor prior to the petition, unless it is introduced and accepted in the\nrecord of the proceeding or is a matter of which it may properly take official\nnotice. (e) The commencement of\nsuch a proceeding does not stay an order to comply involving an alleged\nunderpayment of wages, unless the employer provides security or obtains a\nwaiver of security as prescribed in section 657 or 676.
