  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 385.13 - Voluntary termination of employment and voluntary reduction of earning capacity (voluntary quit)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Public assistance. (1)\n\nFor purposes of this section, the term\nvoluntary quit means voluntary termination of employment and/or a reduction in\nearning capacity for the purpose of qualifying for initial or increased public\nassistance. Such term shall include individuals who provoke their own\ntermination from employment or provoke an employer to reduce their work\nhours. (2)\n\nAn individual will be\ndisqualified from receiving public assistance for a period specified in this\nsubdivision if the social services official determines that such individual\nvoluntarily quit his/her job. (3)\n\nPublic assistance will not be denied to a public assistance applicant or\ndiscontinued for a recipient of such public assistance who requests an increase\nin benefits, unless he/she has been provided a reasonable opportunity to\nexplain why he/she terminated his/her employment or reduced his/her earning\ncapacity or otherwise demonstrated that he/she did not terminate employment or\nreduce earning capacity for the purpose of qualifying for initial or increased\npublic assistance. (4)\n\nIt is the\nresponsibility of the applicant or recipient to provide reasons or otherwise\ndemonstrate that his/her voluntary quit was not for the purpose of qualifying\nfor initial or increased public assistance. (5)\n\nUpon determining that the applicant or\nrecipient voluntarily quit his/her job, the social services district must\ninform the individual that: (i) he/she will\nbe provided a reasonable opportunity to explain his/her reasons for such action\nor otherwise demonstrate that such action was not taken for the purpose of\nqualifying for initial or increased public assistance; and\n(ii)\nit is his/her responsibility to provide\nreasons or otherwise demonstrate that such action was not taken for the purpose\nof qualifying for initial or increased public assistance. (6)\n\nIf the applicant or recipient provides\nreasons or other relevant information regarding his/her voluntary termination\nof employment or reduced earning capacity, the social services official must\ndetermine if the information is sufficient to conclude that the applicant or\nrecipient did not terminate employment or reduce earning capacity to qualify\nfor initial or increased assistance. (i) If\nthe information is determined to be sufficient, the applicant or recipient will\nreceive or continue to receive public assistance if all other eligibility\nconditions are met. (ii)\n\nIf the\ninformation is determined not to be sufficient, the applicant or recipient will\nreceive a notice of denial or intent to reduce or discontinue the public\nassistance benefits. (7)\n\nIf the applicant or recipient provides no reasons for his/her voluntary\ntermination of employment or reduction in earning capacity, then the social\nservices official must conclude that such action was taken with the intent to\nqualify for initial or increased public assistance. (8)\n\nAn applicant or recipient who has been\ndetermined by the social services official to have voluntarily terminated\nhis/her employment or reduced his/her earning capacity for the purpose of\nqualifying for public assistance or increasing his/her public assistance\nbenefits will be disqualified from receiving assistance as follows: (i) as an applicant, for 90 days from the\ndate of voluntary termination or reduced earning capacity; (ii)\nas a recipient, such disqualification\nwill be in accordance with the sanctions prescribed for noncompliance with\nemployment requirements as specified in section\n385.12\n(d) of this\n\nPart. (b) Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. (1)\n\nVoluntary quit: If an individual who is subject to SNAP work requirements\nvoluntarily quits his/her job as described in this section without good cause, he/she is not eligible to participate in the SNAP program. Disqualification\nfrom participation must be in accordance with the provisions of this section\nfor a SNAP applicant and section\n385.12\n(e) of this\n\nPart for a SNAP recipient. This provision applies if the employment involved 30\nhours or more per week or the weekly earnings were equivalent to the federal\nminimum wage multiplied by 30 hours, and the individual voluntarily quit\nhis/her job within 30 days prior to the date of application for SNAP benefits\nor any time thereafter. (2)\n\nReduction of work effort: The reduction of work effort provision applies if, before the reduction, the individual was employed 30 hours or more per week and\nreduced his/her earnings to less than 30 hours multiplied by the federal\nminimum wage; the reduction occurred within a period of 30 days prior to the\ndate of application for SNAP benefits or any time thereafter; and the reduction\nwas voluntary and without good cause. (3)\n\nMinor variations in an individual's work\nhours or weekly minimum wage equivalent wages must be taken into consideration\nwhen assessing a SNAP recipient's compliance with work rules. Minor variations\nthat are not expected to be of an ongoing nature shall not be considered a\nreduction in work effort or result in an individual who is exempt due to the\nhours of employment or minimum wage becoming a work registrant. (4)\n\nBenefits may not be delayed beyond the\nnormal processing times as specified in section\n387.14\nof this Title pending the\noutcome of the determination of whether the applicant voluntarily quit his/her\njob. (5)\n\nIn the case of a SNAP\napplicant household, it must be determined if any household member subject to\nSNAP work requirements voluntarily quit his or her job or reduced his or her\nwork effort without good cause within a period of 30 days prior to the date of\napplication. (6)\n\nIn the case of a\nSNAP applicant household, if the household has lost a source of income or\nexperienced a reduction in income after the date of application, but before the\nhousehold is certified, it must be determined whether a voluntary quit or\nreduction in work effort occurred. (7)\n\nIn the case of a SNAP applicant household\nwhere a voluntary quit without good cause by a household member has been\nestablished, the household member must be disqualified from the SNAP program\nfor a period of time as outlined below, provided, however, that the time period\nof such disqualification shall begin on the date of the application for SNAP\nbenefits. (i) For the first instance of\nvoluntary quit or reduction in work effort without good cause, a period of 30\ndays and thereafter until the individual complies with the requirements of this\nsection as determined by the social services district. (ii)\n\nFor the second instance of voluntary\nquit or reduction in work effort without good cause, a period of 90 days and\nthereafter until the individual complies with the requirements of this section\nas determined by the social services district. (iii)\n\nFor the third and all subsequent\ninstances of voluntary quit or reduction in work effort without good cause, a\nperiod of 180 days and thereafter until the individual complies with the\nrequirements of this section as determined by the social services\ndistrict. (8)\n(i) In the case of a SNAP recipient where a\nwillful and without good cause voluntary quit or reduction in work effort by an\nindividual has been established, including where the voluntary quit by the\nindividual occurred prior to application or between application and\ncertification, but which was discovered after certification, the individual\nmust be disqualified from participation in accordance with the provisions of\nsection\n385.12\n(e) of this\n\nPart; provided, however, that the period of disqualification begins with the\nfirst month after all normal procedures for taking adverse action have been\nfollowed unless a fair hearing is requested and the household requests that\nSNAP benefits be continued without change. In such case, the disqualification\nperiod may not begin until the fair hearing request is withdrawn, the\nindividual fails to appear or a fair hearing decision upholding the social\nservices district's action is issued. An individual whose voluntary quit occurs\nor is determined in the last month of his/her certification period must be\ndenied recertification for a disqualification period established pursuant to\nthe provisions of section\n385.12\n(e) of this\n\nPart beginning with the first month after the certification period ends. If\nsuch individual does not recertify, the disqualification period begins with the\nmonth after the month in which the voluntary quit occurred, and a claim must be\nestablished for any benefits received by the household during that period of\nineligibility. (ii)\n\nIn the case of\na recipient where a voluntary quit by a member of the household has been\nestablished, the provisions of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph apply, and\nthe sanction will only apply to the needs of the disqualified member. (9)\nA household member who is an\nemployee of any federal, State or local government who is dismissed from\nhis/her job due to participation in a strike is deemed to have voluntarily quit\nhis/her job. The social services official must evaluate such a voluntary quit\nin accordance with the requirements of this subdivision. However, terminating a\nself-employment enterprise or resigning a job at the employer's demand cannot\nbe considered a voluntary quit for purposes of this subdivision. In addition, for an individual who quits a job, secures new and comparable employment, but\nthrough no fault of his/her own, loses the new job, the earlier quit must not\nbe considered a voluntary quit. (10)\n\nPersons who, at the time they terminated\nemployment were exempt from the requirement to participate in SNAP work\nrequirements pursuant to section\n385.3\nof this Part, are exempt\nfrom the voluntary quit provisions. (11)\n\nApplicants and recipients must be\nprovided with appropriate notice as specified in section\n387.20\nof this Title if they are\ndisqualified from participation due to a determination of voluntary quit. Such\nnotification must contain the proposed period of disqualification, notice of\nthe household's or a household member's right to reapply in order to resume\nparticipation at the end of the disqualification period established pursuant to\nthe provisions of section\n385.12\n(e) of this\n\nPart, and notice of such person's right to a fair hearing. (12)\nA person who has been disqualified for a\nvoluntary quit and who joins a new household remains ineligible for the\nremainder of the disqualification period. (13)\n\nIf an application is filed in the last\nmonth of disqualification, the social services official must use the same\napplication for the denial of benefits in the remaining month of\ndisqualification and for certification for any subsequent month(s) if all other\neligibility criteria are met. (14)\n\nGood cause for leaving employment or reducing work hours. (i) Prior to any action to deny or terminate\neligibility, the social services official must determine whether there was good\ncause for terminating employment or reducing the hours of work to a total of\nless than 30 hours per week. In determining whether or not good cause exists, the social services official must consider all relevant facts and\ncircumstances, including information submitted by the individual who quit or\nreduced his/her hours and by the current or former employer of such member. A\ndetermination of good cause will be made where the social services official\nfinds that employment was terminated due to: (a) discrimination by an employer based on\nage, race, sex, color, handicap, religious beliefs, national origin or\npolitical beliefs; (b) work demands\nor conditions that rendered continued employment unreasonable, such as not\nbeing paid on schedule; (c) acceptance by the individual of employment or enrollment of at least half-time\nin any recognized school, training program or institution of higher education, that required the individual to leave employment; (d) acceptance by any other household member\nof employment or enrollment at least half-time in any recognized school, training program or institution of higher education in another county or\nsimilar political subdivision which required the household to move and thereby\nrequired the individual to leave employment; (e) resignations by persons under the age of\n60 which are recognized by the employer as retirement; (f) acceptance of a bona fide offer of\nemployment of 30 hours per week or which on a weekly basis yields earnings of\nat least 30 times the federal minimum wage but which, because of circumstances\nbeyond the individual's control, subsequently did not materialize or which\nresulted in employment of less than 30 hours per week or which pays less than\n30 times the federal minimum wage on a weekly basis; (g) leaving a job in connection with patterns\nof employment in which workers frequently move from one employer to another\nsuch as migrant farm labor or construction work; and\n(h) resignation from a job which is\nunsuitable pursuant to the criteria specified in paragraph (15) of this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nQuestionable information pertaining to a voluntary quit must be verified. The\nsocial services district must offer assistance to the household in order to\nassist it to obtain needed verification. Whenever documentary evidence cannot\nbe obtained, the social services district must substitute a possible collateral\nsource. If the household and social services district are unable to obtain the\nrequested verification because the voluntary quit resulted from circumstances\nthat for good reason cannot be verified (such as a resignation from employment\ndue to discrimination practices, unreasonable demands by an employer, or\nbecause the employer cannot be located), the household cannot be denied access\nto or terminated from participation in the program. (15)\n\nAny SNAP employment is considered\nunsuitable if: (i) the wage offered is less\nthan the highest of the applicable Federal minimum wage, the applicable State\nminimum wage, or 80 percent of the Federal minimum wage, if neither the Federal\nnor State minimum wage is applicable; (ii)\nthe employment is offered on a\npiece-rate basis and the average hourly yield the employee can reasonably\nexpect to earn is less than the applicable hourly wages as specified in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph; (iii)\nthe household member, as a condition of\nemployment, must join, resign from, or refrain from joining a legitimate labor\norganization; or\n(iv)\nthe work is\nat a site subject to a strike or lockout at the time of the offer, unless the\nstrike has been enjoined under section\n208\nof the\n\nLabor-Management Relations Act, commonly known as the Taft-Hartley Act, or\nunless an injunction has been issued under section 10 of the Railway Labor\n\nAct. (16)\n\nIn addition, employment is suitable unless the household member involved demonstrates or the\nsocial services district otherwise becomes aware that: (i) the degree of risk to health and safety\nis unreasonable; (ii)\nmedical\nevidence or other reliable information documents that the individual is\nphysically or mentally unfit to perform the job; (iii)\nthe employment offered is not within\nthe individual's major field of experience; however, this provision only\napplies during the first 30 days after the date of registration; (iv)\nthe distance from the individual's home\nto the place of employment is unreasonable. In determining reasonability, the\nsocial services district shall consider the expected wage and the time and cost\nof commuting. Employment must not be considered suitable if daily commuting\ntime exceeds two hours per day, not including the time involved in transporting\nof a child to and from a child care facility. Employment may also be considered\nunsuitable if the distance to the place of employment makes walking prohibitive\nand neither public nor private transportation is available; (v) the working hours or type of employment\nconflicts with the individual's religious observance, convictions or beliefs; or\n(vi)\nthe individual lacks\nadequate child care for children in the household who are under age\n13. (17)\n\nEnding a\nvoluntary quit or reduction in hours disqualification. (i) An individual may reestablish eligibility\nafter the end of his/her disqualification period if he/she applies and is\notherwise eligible, and if he/she: (a) complies with the requirements of this section and of this Part as determined\nby the social services district, or\n(b) secures new employment which is\ncomparable in salary or hours to the job which was quit; however, comparable\nemployment may entail fewer hours or lower net salary than the job which was\nquit; or\n(c) becomes exempt from\nSNAP work requirements pursuant to section\n385.3\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nEligibility may be\nreestablished during a disqualification, and the individual, if otherwise\neligible, may be permitted to resume participation if the individual becomes\nexempt from SNAP work requirements pursuant to the provisions of section\n385.3\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (iii)\n\nExcept in cases of\npermanent disqualification, following the end of a disqualification, if an\napplication for SNAP benefits is filed in the final month of the mandatory\ndisqualification period, the social services district shall use the same\napplication for the denial of benefits in the remaining month of\ndisqualification and for the certification for any subsequent month(s) if all\nother eligibility criteria are met.
