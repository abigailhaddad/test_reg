  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 5014.6 - Compliance with IRC section 401(a)(9)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The system shall comply with IRC section\n401(a)(9). (b) The entire interest\nof a member shall be distributed: (1)\nto the\nmember not later than the required beginning date; or\n(2)\nin accordance with IRC section 401(a)(9), over the life of the member or over the lives of the member and a designated\nbeneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the\nmember or the life expectancy of the member and a designated\nbeneficiary). (c) Where\ndistributions have begun under paragraph (b)(2) of this section and the member\ndies before his entire interest is distributed to such member, the remaining\nportion of such interest shall be distributed at least as rapidly as under the\nmethod of distribution being used under paragraph (b)(2) of this section as of\nthe date of death. (d) If the member\ndies before the distribution of the member's interest has begun, the entire\ninterest of the member, if any, shall be distributed within five years after\nthe member's death, except that, if any portion of the member's interest is\npayable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary and such portion will\nbe distributed (in accordance with such regulations) over the life of such\ndesignated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life\nexpectancy of such beneficiary) and such distributions begin not later than one\nyear after the date of the member's death (or such later date as may be\npermitted by the United States Secretary of the Treasury), such portion shall\nbe treated as distributed on the date such distributions began. (e) For these purposes: (1)\nthe term required beginning date means\n\nApril 1st of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in\nwhich the member attains age 701/2 or the calendar year in which the member\nretires; (2)\nthe term designated\nbeneficiary mean any individual designated as a beneficiary by the\nmember; (3)\nthe term entire\ninterest of the member does not include ancillary benefits (such as lump sum\ndeath benefits) which are in no event available to the member; and\n(4)\nthe term IRC section 401(a)(9) means\nsection\n401(a)(9)\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code of 1986, as amended and as hereafter may be amended, and any\nregulations promulgated thereunder, if and to the extent applicable to the\nsystem. (f) Any\ndistribution required under the incidental death benefit requirements of IRC\nsection 401(a) shall be treated as a distribution subject to IRC section\n401(a)(9). (g) No option shall be\npermitted whereby a member would receive in retirement less than 50 percent of\nthe actuarial equivalent of the member's retirement allowance without optional\nmodification during the member's life expectancy, provided, however, that the\nforegoing shall not apply if the surviving beneficiary is the retiree's\nspouse. (h) Nothing herein shall be\nconstrued to require the system to provide any benefit not permitted under the\nlaws governing the system. (i) In\ncases where the sole beneficiary of the option designated at retirement is the\nmember's spouse, a member will not be permitted to elect an option otherwise\npermitted under this Part which provides for a guaranteed payment for a period\nof years that exceeds the greater of: (1)\nthe\njoint and last survivor life expectancy of the member and the member's spouse; or\n(2)\nthe distribution period for\nrequired minimum distributions permitted under regulations of the United States\n\nDepartment of Treasury implementing IRC section 401(a)(9). In cases where the sole beneficiary of the option designated\nat retirement is not the member's spouse, a member will not be permitted to\nelect an option otherwise permitted under this Part which provides for a\nguaranteed payment for a period of years that exceeds the distribution period\nfor required minimum distributions permitted under regulations of the United\n\nStates Department of Treasury implementing IRC section\n401(a)(9).
