  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 141.14 - Appendix A\nState Regulations\nIPIRP Specification Document\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nNew York State (NYS) Vehicle & Traffic Law (V&T)\nwas amended to allow the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to conduct a 5-year\npilot program to assess the delivery of the Motor Vehicle Accident Prevention\n\nCourse, commonly referred to as Point and Insurance Reduction Program (PIRP)\nvia Alternate Delivery Methods (ADMs). Approved NYS classroom PIRP Sponsors may\nparticipate in the IPIRP pilot by meeting state requirements, included herein, and adhering to regulations set forth in Part 141 of the Commissioner's\nregulations. To distinguish the current classroom based program from the\n\nAlternate Delivery Method (ADM) Program, NYS is naming this pilot program\n\"IPIRP\", to specifically reference the internet as described in the enabling\nlegislation. NYS is not limiting the pilot methods to the internet, in the\n\nCommissioner's discretion, so long as providers can ensure that all the pilot\nprogram requirements are met. NYS has 13 approved public sponsors delivering\nclassroom training. Only approved providers can participate in the IPIRP; although new sponsors wishing to participate can apply to be a IPIRP provider\nat any time. Application processing preference may be given to existing, approved classroom sponsors. Requirement Overview\n\nThe enabling legislation, Chapter 751 of the Laws\nof 2005, charged DMV with developing a pilot program that\nensures: * Student identity is validated at registration. * Student participation is validated throughout the\ncourse. * The 320 minute time requirement for the course is\nmet. * Students successfully complete the course. The DMV has established the following general\nrequirements: * Only approved, existing classroom sponsors will be\neligible to participate in the pilot program. * Approved sponsors want to participate in the pilot must\nfollow the proposed application process. * Sponsors shall have the responsibility of identity\nvalidation, as well as validating course participation. * Sponsors shall be required to meet information security\nguidelines. * IPIRP course delivery shall have specific\nrequirements. * IPIRP pilot review and study evaluation shall be\nrequired. Goals of the Pilot\n\nThe success of the pilot will be based on the following\nthree goals of the program; Interactive Interface, Expansion of Traffic Safety\n\nAwareness and Use of Identification Technologies. Each of these goals shall\nhave several measures to evaluate the effectiveness of alternate delivery\nmethods, as described below. Sponsors will use a common set of questions\ndeveloped by DMV to collect this information from students. Interactive Interface shall assess whether a course\ndelivered in a non-classroom environment can engage the course participant. This goal shall be measured as follows: * Participant satisfaction with the course. This will be\nmeasured using a Likert based scale where success will be determined when a\nparticipant rates the course good or excellent. Overall, it is expected that\nthis rating will occur at least 80% of the time. * Participant believes course was interesting. Without an\ninstructor to engage the student, the course material presentation becomes very\nimportant. This shall be measured when the participant rates the course as\ninteresting or very interesting using a Likert based scale. Overall, it is\nexpected that this rating will occur at least 80% of the time. * Participant believes ADM course was easy to use and\ninstructions understandable. Given the independent nature of the course\ndelivery, overall participant satisfaction will be impacted by how easy and\ntrouble free the learning experience was. This will be measured using a Likert\nscale and success will be measured when the participant selects easy or very\neasy to use. Overall, it is expected that this rating will occur at least 80%\nof the time. The goal of Expansion of Traffic Safety Awareness\nrecognizes that if a course is made available using alternate technology and it\nis convenient for the participant, there will be an increase in the number of\ncompleters of Accident Prevention Courses. This goal will be measured as\nfollows: * Number of New Completers. This will be measured based on\nthe number of actual completers of alternate technology. This shall be measured\nby the number of completers for each sponsor for both ADM and classroom based\nofferings. A measure of success shall be that the ADMs experience double digit\ngrowth (as a % of all offerings) each year they are available. * Impact of Course. This will be measured by the\ncompleter's opinion on whether the course is likely to influence how they will\ndrive in the future. This will be measured using a Likert based scale where\nsuccess is determined when a participant indicates the course will improve\ntheir driving some or very much. Overall, it is expected that this rating will\noccur at least 80% of the time. DMV shall develop a uniform survey instrument\nfor this purpose that all sponsors shall use. * Impact/Improvement. This shall be measured by the\nsponsors when they complete their PIRP effectiveness studies at the end of the\n5-year pilot, or when due, depending upon the requirements spelled out in this\n\nPart, in Vehicle & Traffic Law, article 12-B and also in Commissioner\n\nRegulations, section 138. Each sponsor will be required to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of its ADM course, as is also required for classroom courses, by\nmeasuring a significant impact in accident and conviction reduction in the 18\nmonths after completing the course. Depending upon the number of completers, DMV may accept a smaller population than is required in the regulations if an\ninsufficient number of completers is available. The goal of Evaluate Identification Technologies is to\nmeasure usage with a variety of alternate instructional delivery methods. DMV\nshall measure this goal as follows: * Number of alternate techniques employed. This shall be\nmeasured based on the number of different types of technologies employed by the\nvarious sponsors. Technology usage shall cover both the delivery method\n(internet, CD, etc.) as well as types of validation techniques used by each\nsponsor. A measure of success shall be the number of multiple media and\nvalidation techniques employed by all sponsors. The more variation employed by\nsponsors, the more successful the pilot will be deemed in terms of this\nmeasure. * Robustness/reliability of various methods. This shall be\nmeasured based on whether the sponsor continues to offer a particular media or\ntechnique from the beginning of the pilot, until the end of the pilot and shall\nbe partially based on consumer use and satisfaction. If a technology is robust\nenough, it is likely to be continued throughout the pilot period and over time, have more and more participants being drawn to the technology. Overall, it is\nexpected that all approved pilot programs continue for the 5 year pilot as\ninitially approved (except for content updates), and that consumer satisfaction\nwith alternate techniques does not decline over the 5-year period. Both the state and the sponsors will compile these measures\nduring and at the conclusion of the pilot as appropriate. These goals and\nmeasures shall be the basis for the DMV's report to the Legislature and\n\nGovernor at the conclusion of the pilot. Data/Security Requirements\n\nGeneral Requirements\n\nThe data security of the administration of the overall\n\nMotor Vehicle Accident Prevention Course program in NYS is guided by a variety\nof regulations at both the Federal and State level. Generally all of the\nregulations and standards are consistent with each other. In any instance where\nthey may be disparate, the more stringent standard will preempt the lesser\nstandard. Recognizing that technology and standards evolve over time, NYS shall\nrequire sponsors to adhere to promulgated rules and regulations and state\nstandards governing the program and strive to adhere to national standards and\nguidance documents related to this program. The actual standards that apply\nshall be based on each individual sponsor's solution. In the event conflicting\nrequirements appear or sponsors require additional guidance as to which\nstandards apply specifically to their solution, contact Driver Program\n\nRegulation (see contact information in closing section) for\nclarification. Federal Regulations\n\nFederal regulations detailing the Driver's Privacy\n\nProtection Act are contained under\n18 USC §\n2721\net. seq., which are available on DMV's\nwebsite at\nwww.nysdmv.com. These rules\ndetail permissible uses of personal information that is disclosed for use in\nmotor vehicle accident prevention courses, as well as other uses. All sponsors\nand their agents participating in the program shall be required to execute a\n\nNon-Disclosure Affidavit with DMV as part of the application process. Federal regulations related to fraud and related activity\nin connection with computers are contained under Title 18 of the United States\n\nCode, Part 1, Chapter 47, section 1030. These rules detail types of computer\nrelated offenses that will be punishable if found to occur during the pilot\nperiod. National Standards\n\nNational organizations that promulgate standards related to\nthis pilot program, and specific standards, include, but are not limited\nto: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)\nwww.nist.org\n800-76\n\nBiometric Data Specification for Personal Identity\n\nCertification\n\nInter National Committee For Information Technology\n\nStandards (INCITS)\nwww.incits.org\n377\n\nInformation Technology-Finger Pattern Based\n\nInterchange Format\n379\n\nInformation Technology-Iris Image Interchange\n\nFormat\n385\n\nInformation Technology-Face Recognition Format for\n\nData Interchange\n395\n\nInformation Technology-Biometric Data Interchange\n\nFormats-Signature/Sign Data (Project 1603)\n396\n\nInformation Technology-D Hand Geometry Format for\n\nData Interchange (Project 1643)\n398\n\nInformation Technology-Common Biometric Exchange\n\nFormats Framework (Project 1622)\n409.1:200x\n\nInformation Technology-Biometric Performance Testing\nand Reporting-Part 1: Principles and Framework (Project 1602)\n409.2:200x\n\nInformation Technology-Biometric Performance Testing\nand Reporting-Part 2: Technology Testing and Reporting (Project 1602)\n409.3:200x\n\nInformation Technology-Biometric Performance Testing\nand Reporting-Part 3: Scenario Testing and Reporting (Project 1602)\n\nState Laws - DMV\nThe general legal authority for the Department of Motor\n\nVehicles to require and implement the IPIRP pilot exists under article 12-C\n(Accident Prevention Course Internet Technology Pilot Program) of the New York\n\nState Vehicle and Traffic Law (V&T). Given the use of personal\nidentification information, sponsors shall also be subject to New York State\n\nTechnology Law § 208, the Information Security Breach and Notification Act, which requires notification when a person without valid authorization has\nacquired personal information. State Regulations - DMV\nThe NYS Department of Motor Vehicles regulations are\nreferred to as 15 NYCRR Part\n138, related to the classroom course and 15 NYCRR\nPart\n141, the PIRP Internet/ADM pilot. State Standards - OFT & CSCIC\nThe NYS Office for Technology (OFT) and NYS Office of Cyber\n\nSecurity and Critical Infrastructure Coordination have established Information\n\nTechnology and Security policies and standards as they relate to developed\nsystems in NYS, whether done in-house or by an outside entity. OFT policies can be found at the following URL: www.oft.state.ny.us\nand include the\nfollowing: G02-001-Guidelines for Internet Privacy\nP04-002-Statewide Technology Policy - Accessibility of\n\nState Agency Web-based Intranet/Internet Information and Applications\nS04-001-NYS Mandatory Technology Standard - Accessibility\nof State Agency Web-based Intranet/Internet Information and Applications\nCSCIC policies can be found at the following URL: http://www.cscic.state.ny.us/lib/policies/\nand include the following: P03-002 v.2.1 \"Information Security Policy\"\nSponsors participating in the pilot shall comply with the\nentire Information Security Policy, and the DMV policies listed below, except\nfor those elements that clearly apply to state employees only. DMV will provide\ncopies of the confidential DMV policies to sponsoring agencies upon receipt of\na signed Non-Disclosure Affidavit, so as to ensure confidentiality of\ninformation contained in these polices. DMV Policies\n\nThe following is a summarized list of confidential DMV\npolicies that shall be adhered to by the sponsors. DMV may, over the course of\nthe pilot, add other DMV or NYS security requirements as new related and\napplicable policies are issued. These documents are not to be shared outside of\nthe sponsor's organization or to be used for any other purpose than\nIPIRP. Modem Policy\n\nConnecting a dial-up modem (a device computers use to\ntransfer data using telephone lines) to a computer system on the DMV network, even when approved, can be a potential security risk. When modem usage is\napproved certain guidelines must be followed when technically feasible. Exemption from these guidelines may be approved in writing when it is not\ntechnically feasible to follow. This will apply to transmission of completer\ndata if File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is utilized during phase 2 (see later\nsection on data transmission). Equipment Disposal Policy\n\nThere is a risk of disclosure of sensitive\ninformation through careless disposal or re-use of equipment. Storage devices\nsuch as tape, diskettes or CDs, containing sensitive information must be\nphysically destroyed or securely overwritten to prevent the unauthorized\ndisclosure of sensitive DMV information, depending on the sensitivity level of\nthe data stored thereon. Storage Devices at the very minimum must be\nre-formatted before disposal or reuse by another user. User Password Security Policy\n\nPassword protection ensures the integrity of the\nfiles and applications by protecting against unauthorized access to programs\nand data. Example: If a\nPC is left unprotected, unauthorized persons gaining access could read, add, delete, or change data records or make changes to the data files or\napplications. It is the responsibility of each sponsor to\nreasonably protect against unauthorized activities performed by their\nemployees' user IDs. Each user is responsible for the data that resides on\nhis/her computer and for any activities performed through use of that computer\nor other password protected device.

unique questions asked during the course, where\nrequired. As per section\n141.5\nand\n141.8\nof this Part, each\nsponsoring agency application must include a specific plan for how instruction\ntime will be calculated. A record of such calculations, including all\ninstruction time, will be recorded and stored by the sponsor and made available\nto the third party monitor and the Department for monitoring and quality\ncontrol purposes. This information, as part of each student's completion\nrecord, must clearly differentiate actual interactive instruction time from\nnon-instruction time such as log-in procedures, administrative tasks, help\nfunctions, validation processes, and audio/visual media download times. Such\nrecord shall be maintained for five years. Data Submission\n\nIn the event a student begins, but does not complete the\ncourse, sponsors will complete as much information as possible (for example, start date and start time). DMV strongly recommends that sponsors DO NOT\ncollect social security numbers, as they are not needed to match to the license\nrecord. As part of pilot participation, sponsors will be expected to transmit\nthe required data either to DMV and/or a third party under contract to DMV. Data transmission is to be achieved in a manner and frequency to be determined\nby DMV. A sponsor's ability to properly collect, store and report this data\nshall be validated during the sponsor IPIRP curriculum review and approval\nprocess. Depending upon the format selected by the sponsor (internet, DVD or\nother), sponsors shall be required to capture, store and report additional\ninformation such as student footprint data or monitored exam data. DMV\nanticipates the process for completer data transmission to be implemented in a\nphased approach as follows: Phase 1 - The completer data will be sent in the existing\n(pre-IPIRP) format either via existing methods or via Secure FTP. The elements\nsubmitted to the DMV will be the same elements that are currently submitted to\nthe DMV. However, the entirety of the elements listed above under \"IPIRP\nStudent Completer Information\" must be retained. Sponsors shall use a unique\ndelivery agent code to delineate the IPIRP completer from the traditional\nclassroom completer. Failure to correctly delineate the IPIRP completer from\nthe traditional classroom completer may result in sponsor suspension. Phase 2 - The completer data will be submitted to the DMV\nor a third party approved by DMV. The elements of the data that need to be\nsubmitted shall conform to ALL of the elements listed under \"IPIRP Student\n\nCompleter Information\". The format and data transmission specifics will be\npublished by DMV under a separate \"Technical Interface\" document prior to Phase\n\nTwo to all participating IPIRP sponsors. Student Footprint Logs\n(Internet/Phone Based\n\nOnly)\n\nTo facilitate DMV's ability to audit the 320 minute time\nrequirement, sponsors that offer computer based training shall be required to\ncollect and store logs of student activity as they progress through the\ntraining. Data stored for each student, during each session must\ninclude: Data/Column Name\n\nData Type - Length -\nValue\n\nDescription\n\nMotorist Client ID\nChar (9)\nID from NYS driver's license\n\nStart Date\n\nChar (10) (mm/dd/yyyy)\n\nDate Motorist Started Course\n\nStart Time\n\nChar (6) (hhmm AM/PM)\n\nStart Time of IPIRP Course\n\nEnd Date\n\nChar (10) (mm/dd/yyyy)\n\nDate Motorist Ended Course\n\nEnd Time\n\nChar (6) (hhmm AM/PM)\n\nEnd Time of IPIRP Course\n\nTotal Time\n\nChar (5)\n\nCalculated based on End Date/Time\n- Start Date/Time. Captures overall\ntime from registration through completion, including\nproctored testing if required. Last Module Completed\n\nChar (2)?\nSponsor designated code for where in application\nstudent ended session\n\nTotal Instruction Time in Minutes\n\nChar (3)\n\nCalculated based on sponsor's approved calculation\nmethod. Excludes non-instruction time such as log-in procedures, administrative\ntasks, help functions, validation processes and audio/visual media download\ntimes. Sponsors will not be required to transmit this data, but\nare expected to store it and make it available to DMV, upon request, as needed. The logs must be stored in the format above and must be human readable.

These materials shall be made available to DMV and their\nrepresentatives upon request. Data Security\n\nRequirements\n\nPersonal Identification Information\n\nInformation that is considered personal information\nincludes, but is not limited to, participant name, address, date of birth, motorist identification number, client identification number, social security\nnumber (if collected), credit card information, answers to personal and content\nquestions and biometric samples. Computer systems storing this information\nshall be protected against data theft and loss. Financial transactions shall be\nconducted securely, so that theft of personal identification information is\nunlikely. In the event this information becomes compromised, sponsors are\nrequired to investigate the incident and determine what data has been\ncompromised. Suspected or confirmed inappropriate access to or disclosure of\npersonal identification data collected for IPIRP shall be reported to DMV's\n\nDirector of Audit Services or designees by phone within 1 hour of detection. This notification shall be followed up in writing by fax or e-mail within 24\nhours of detection. The sponsor shall fully investigate the compromise and\nreport the circumstances as well as the steps taken or proposed to be taken to\nprevent similar instances in the future. Failure by the sponsor to notify DMV\nof disclosure of participant personal information, as specified, will result in\n\nSponsor suspension or revocation. Notification must be made to the following\nindividuals: DPR - Director, Driver Program Regulation (518)\n486-5572\n\nField Audit - Director or designee (518) 474-0881\n\nIf personal identification information has been\ncompromised, the sponsor must provide assistance and information regarding\nidentity theft, how the student can monitor their credit report and what\nresources exist for preventing and/or identifying and reporting any potential\nidentity theft. In the event of a security breach, DMV will allow sponsors\naccess to their bond for the purposes of breach notification and necessary\nfollow through. Security Reviews\n\nSponsors shall be required to undergo a security review as\npart of the sponsor approval process. DMV personnel will complete this security\nreview, and it will involve a site visit and a series of interviews via\ntelephone and/or e-mail. The Division of Field Investigation site visit will focus\non a review of physical security and computer system access. The sponsor shall\npay all costs for travel and lodging incurred by the Department of Motor\n\nVehicles in connection with all security reviews. The Information Security Office interviews will, at a\nminimum, review: * System Description\n\nDiagrams of the system, including data connections. Where and how any custom source code is stored and\nsecured. An inventory of data stores, such as files and\ndatabases. An inventory of sensitive or confidential data that is\nstored, processed or transmitted by the system. * Security and Risk\nA list of the DMV and vendor contacts in case of a security\nincident. An inventory of the system vulnerabilities and what\nprotection will be in place for each of the vulnerabilities. Review of how DMV private or sensitive data is\nsecured. Procedures if secured DMV data is compromised or\nlost. * Backup and Recovery\n\nReview of the vendor's backup plan. Procedure for reconstructing data from other sources, if\navailable. Estimate of the recovery time from a disaster (\"how soon do\nthey need to come back up?\") and the recovery steps. The business continuity plan. The disaster recovery plan for this application. * Disposal\n\nProcedures for disposing of confidential information, both\npaper and electronic. The security review may include the release of sensitive\ninformation (e.g., a description and diagram of your system) as\napplicable. Sponsors shall be provided with an opportunity to correct\nsignificant security vulnerabilities noted during the security review and a\nfollow-up visit and/or type of confirmation will occur to confirm that\ndeficiencies have been remediated. Sponsors that do not pass a security review shall not be\nallowed to offer courses via IPIRP/ADM until they do pass a security review. DMV reserves the right, over the course of the pilot, to conduct follow-up\nreviews to ensure that security standards identified during the original review\ncontinue to be maintained. User Interface Requirements\nNYS desires IPIRP courses that engage the user in the\nlearning experience. Courses that are reviewed which do not require the student\nto \"participate\" in some fashion will not be approved. The user's graphical\ninterface must be user friendly, which is demonstrated through: * Ease of use. * Length of time it takes for pages to load. * Ability to play multimedia during the course (assuming\nstudent has appropriate hardware and software installed). * Ability to log on and off the course site (or stop and\nstart computer or video based courses), and navigate easily and freely to\nmaterial previously covered. * Easily understood policies & procedures regarding\ncourse and usage during the signup process. * Scrolling should be limited to up and down where\nappropriate, versus also requiring the user to scroll left to right. * No advertisements (including pop-ups) will be allowed\nduring the entire course (including sign up, login and course\ncompletion). In an effort to encourage innovation and alternative\nmethods, NYS will allow sponsors to choose which mandatory elements they will\nincorporate in their course delivery, within certain parameters, as defined\nbelow: Audio/Visual\n\nRequirements\n\nParticipants will have varying internet connection\nbandwidth rates, which must be taken into account in the overall ratio of\nmultimedia to alternate content delivery (e.g., chart with text), where\npossible. Timing requirements, as outlined in the table below, are\nbased on successful completion of the minimum course duration of 320 minutes. DMV anticipates the course to be broken into 6-10 sections that can be\ncompleted at a reasonable pace. These sections would be logical groupings of\nmaterial from the approved classroom curriculum. Minimum content will be\ndetermined based on the following methods as described below: Timing of Content to Determine Minimum Time\n\nRequirements Met\n\nType of Content\n\nTypes of Material/\nSpecifications\n\nAmount of Time\n\nAllowed\n\nMultimedia\n\nAudio and/or visual clips, where possible. Audio/visual should be in sync. Each clip shall be no more than 6 minutes in\nduration, except where approved by the department. Material in written text can\nalso be available as audio (verbatim or ad lib), to be played at the students\noption, which will determine course timing. The total video should not exceed\n25% of allowed time for online courses. Audio/visual clip download time shall\nnot be unnecessarily long so as to disrupt the flow of the course or diminish\nthe student's course experience. Actual play time of all audio/visual material. Simulations & Exercises\n\nThis can be \"follow along\" video or interactive\naudio/video that engages the user to evaluate a key learning point from the\ntraining (e.g., response time, range of motion, visual acuity, etc.)\n\nActual time of simulation or exercise, allowing\nsufficient time for user to follow along at required pace. Charts & Graphs\n\nStatistics included must be the most current\navailable, and are expected to be updated annually at a minimum. Allow 1 minute for each chart or graph. Personal Questions\n\nCollected from 3rd party database, DMV license file\n(if approved), or as collected by the sponsor at time of application. Allow 45 seconds to answer each personal\nquestion. Content Questions\n\nTest bank questions are developed by the sponsor and\napproved by DMV. Allow 60 seconds to answer each content\nquestion. Written Text\n\nIncluding bulleted lists, captions, paragraphs and\nother written material. Time allowed will be a word count, when audio\naugmentation is not available, will be based on a physical word count. The word\ncount shall be divided by 100 words per minute. The result of total words divided by 100. This will\nbe the time allowed. Recognizing that material on the internet can vary widely, and that the emphasis is on student learning, DMV will consider alternate time\ncalculation methods, at their discretion, so long as sponsors can demonstrate\nthat the course meets the 320-minute requirement. The responsibility for validating student identity, as well\nas student participation, shall be with the sponsors, and their delivery\nagents, if applicable. While DMV intends to monitor sponsor compliance through\nexisting resources, and/or through a third party contractor, the sponsor shall\nbe accountable for their compliance. Given that a variety of content\ndelivery/validation methods exist today, and more are expected over the course\nof the pilot, DMV will set an initial, minimum threshold, which is as secure as\nthe existing classroom course. Customer Service\n\nRequirements\nDMV shall require that: * The cost of all services is spelled out to the motorist\nat the point of sale (course cost, customer service fees, certificate costs, technology costs, proctored exams, etc. where applicable). There shall be no\nhidden fees and fees shall not change after the student registers for the\ncourse and accepts the terms and conditions required by the regulation. * The course delivery and participation validation method, and terms and conditions of course and course payment/refund policies shall be\ndescribed to the participant prior to the sale. * Customers shall agree to the terms and conditions, including language to be provided by DMV, by typing \"I agree\" prior to the\ncourse commencing (or by signing an agreement in person either at point of sale\nor during proctored exam after identity validated). * Sponsors shall provide customer service telephone\nsupport, that is at a minimum, Monday through Saturday from 8 am to 4 pm EST. DMV will consider sponsor proposals to utilize an interactive voice message\nsystem in place of live contact or in conjunction with live contact. DMV will\nrevisit this requirement after the pilot program has been operational for 6\nmonths. * Sponsors shall incorporate the contents of the DMV C-32A\nbrochure, described in Part 138.11 of the Commissioner's regulations, into the\ncourse material. This can be covered during registration if desired. * Sponsors shall make available a printable version of key\nlearning points covered during the training to participants so that they may\nhave a ready reference if desired. Participant Validation\n\nIn order to meet the legislative intent, and to assure that\nrigorous course requirements are met (including identity validation and student\nparticipation), while allowing multiple delivery methods to be employed, DMV\nhas assigned \"point\" values to the following validation techniques: Participant Validation Technique Options Available to\n\nSponsors in Designing Program\n\nMethod of Validation\n\nExamples/Parameters of\n\nValidation Method\n\nPoints\n\nAssigned\n\nFacial Recognition\n\nBiometric-Hardware provided by sponsor and included\nin cost of course\n6\n\nFingerprint\n\nBiometric-Hardware provided by sponsor and included\nin cost of course\n6\n\nHandprint\n\nBiometric-Hardware provided by sponsor and included\nin cost of course\n6\n\nRetina or Iris Scan\n\nBiometric-Hardware provided by sponsor and included\nin cost of course\n6\n\nEar Scan\n\nBiometric-Hardware provided by sponsor and included\nin cost of course\n6\n\nKeystroke Analysis\n\nBiometric-Software provided by sponsor and included\nin cost of course\n5\n\nVoice Print\n\nBiometric-Software provided by sponsor and included\nin cost of course\n6\n\nOther Biometric\n\nPrior DMV approval required\n\nTo be determined\n\nProctored Exam\n\nStudents must pass a multiple choice test with a\ncorrect score of 75% or better in order to obtain a certificate. Students will\nbe permitted to bring in sponsor provided material into the exam. 5\n\nIn Person Contact\n\nIdentity validated at time of registration, or if set\nup as a computer based training at delivery agent site, delivery of\ntraining\n3\n\nPhone Contact\n\nPrompting student to dial an 800 number to answer\ncontent or identity questions. 2\n\nThird Party Database\n\nUsing individualized questions based on data stored\nin a credit bureau or government database (this is unrelated to and separate\nfrom a 3rd party monitoring organization)\n2\n\nOnline/Instant Message\n\nPrompting student to answer questions through an\nonline chat discussion group or when online technical assistance\nrequested. 1\n\nPersonal Questions\n\nQuestions aimed at authenticating identity. 1\n\nContent Questions\n\nQuestions aimed at determining student\nparticipation. 1\n\nPay Per View Buttons\n\nUsing features of cable TV to have user interface for\nanswering personal or content questions. 1\nE-mail\n\nSending technical assistance response or user names\nand password for site access. If both user name and password are transmitted in\nthe same email, password must be changed when the participant first logs\non. 1\n\nOther Techniques\n\nPrior DMV approval required\n\nTo be determined\n\nSponsors seeking approval for their IPIRP courses must have\na minimum of seven or more points, using two or more of these techniques, provided, however, that one point must be for content questions. The content\nquestions may be asked at random points throughout the course or at the end of\neach chapter or unit. Such questions do not need to be in the form of a final\nexam. Sponsors are free to suggest alternate techniques, although the actual\npoints assigned will be based on a determination by DMV. Depending upon the\nrobustness of the solution offered by the sponsor, DMV reserves the right to\nincrease or decrease the point values above to reflect the quality of a\nparticular sponsor's solution in meeting or exceeding the validation\nrequirements. Participant private information, as defined in the personal\nidentification section shall be encrypted. All authentication information shall\nbe protected; for example, it should not be stored or transmitted in clear\ntext. Validation Requirements\n\nThis section details requirements not otherwise detailed in\nthe previous sections, and focuses primarily on requirements for participant\nvalidation, and also data storage. Participant validation will focus on\n\nBiometrics, Proctored Exam, In Person Contact, Telephone Contact, Online\n\nChat/Discussion Group, Personal and Content Questions, Pay Per View and Email\n\nRequirements. Biometrics\nDMV shall allow a variety of Biometric Data Formats, so\nlong as initial sample collection and periodic validation of ongoing\nparticipation against the original sample occur throughout the course at random\nintervals. DMV recognizes that many biometric standards are relatively new and\nthat some available technologies in the marketplace may not strictly adhere to\nthe standards. DMV expects the ADM pilot will allow sponsors the opportunity to\nexplore alternate validation techniques, in lieu of requiring a proctored\nexam. If a sponsor selects Biometrics as a validation technique, they will be required to capture at least 7 biometric samples over the 320\nminutes of instruction. These 7 samples shall be stored for a minimum of 5\nbusiness days from course completion, and no longer than 30 calendar days from\ncourse completion, and shall be subject to DMV review. In the event DMV elects\nto review samples, the sponsor must provide the appropriate hardware and\nsoftware in which to allow DMV to verify that validation was correct. This\ninformation shall be considered \"personal information\" and must be kept\nsecurely. For each sample, the sponsor must also associate the client\nidentification number on the motorist's driver's license, date and time the\nsample was collected and by whom the sample was collected and/or verified by\n(as appropriate). Sponsors shall ensure that their biometric validation\ntechnique(s) is calibrated to be at least 90% accurate. Students who fail to\nhave their identity verified by the biometric technique after five attempts\nshall be excluded from the course. Proctored Exam\n\nUnless biometrics are used in the ADM course, or sponsors\ncan prove to DMV's satisfaction that rigorous identity validation and\nparticipation techniques are employed, a proctored exam shall be required. Requirements for the proctored exam are as follows: * Exam locations shall be approved by DMV, and can be\nprovided as part of the sponsor application process. It is preferred that tests\nbe administered at colleges, universities and other testing facilities that\nroutinely offer proctored exams, however delivery agencies may also administer\nthe proctored exam. * To the degree possible, proctors shall be independent of\nthe sponsor, as well as with those taking the test. Typically, exam proctors\nare educators, law enforcement personnel, supervisory administrative staff, lawyers, engineers, etc. that have no stake in the outcome of the exam. Delivery agencies may also administer the proctored exam. * Students taking the proctored exam must present two forms\nof identity, with one being their NYS driver's license photo identification. These must be validated against the schedule (name, motorist ID) and also\nvisually against the photograph. Students must sign in, indicating agreement\nwith the test requirements. Signatures must be validated against signatures on\nthe student IDs. Students without proper identification, or who appear to be\npresenting false identification must be refused entrance into the test. * During the exam, proctors must monitor student exam\ncompletion by either being in the room, in a different room separated by a\nglass window or via video monitoring. * The exam location must be closed to the public and be\nfree from distractions. * Students will be given a sponsor developed\nmultiple-choice exam. These exams will be uniquely generated from a random pool\nof 100 test questions, which are developed by the sponsor and approved by DMV. When submitting test questions for approval, sponsors shall identify where in\ntheir course curriculum the answer is contained. Sponsors are required to\nrefresh questions every 6-12 months. Students must receive a passing score of\n75% correct to pass the course. Students that fail the exam, will be allowed\none additional opportunity to pass the exam, which will be considered a\n\"retest\". Students will be allowed up to 60 minutes to take the exam and will\nbe allowed to bring in materials printed from the sponsor's course. * Students shall complete the proctored exam within 30\ncalendar days from completing the course, although within 1-14 days is\npreferable. Retests can be completed within 30 calendar days from the date of\ninitial completion. In Person Contact\n\nThis identity validation method refers to face-to-face\ncontact between the student and either the sponsor staff or the delivery agency\nstaff, identified in the sponsor's application. This can be at the point of\nsale or course delivery (computer based training). During this contact, sponsor\nstaff is required to: * Ask students to present two forms of identity, with one\nbeing photo identification in the form of a government issued driver's license\nor non-driver ID. * The motorist must be validated visually against the\nphotograph. * Students must sign an agreement, indicating willingness\nto comply with course guidelines. * Signatures must be validated against signatures on the\nstudent's government issued drivers license or non-driver ID. * Students without proper identification, or who appear to\nbe presenting false identification must be refused entrance into the\ncourse. Phone Contact\n\nPhone contact, for the purpose of this identity validation\nmethod, does NOT include customer service phone support described earlier in\nthis document. This phone contact is selected by the sponsor as an additional\nvalidation/participation method. This method can either be the sponsor\ncontacting the student while the course is being delivered, or by prompting the\nstudent to contact the sponsor at a toll free number. Once the student contacts the sponsor, the student's\nidentity is validated using personal questions and/or the student's\nparticipation is validated using content questions. These questions would be in\naddition to the proctored exam. In addition, the questions used for phone\nvalidation cannot be the same as those included in a proctored exam. It is\npreferred that when phone contact is initiated by the student, when prompted, that a live operator be available to answer the phone within a minute. Recognizing that 24/7 service may not be practical, sponsors can elect to\nutilize an automated service outside of the core customer service hours. See\npersonal and content questions for more guidance on these requirements. Sponsors shall be expected to capture specific data on each\nof these contacts, including participant identity information, date/time of\ncontact, operator guiding the call and answers to personal/content questions as\npart of ADM participant information. This information should be stored\nelectronically and be available for the entire 5 year pilot period. Sponsors\nshall implement security measures to ensure that personal validation\ninformation cannot be retained by operators or by contracted services, such as\noutsourcers in other countries. Third Party Database\n\nQuestions\n\nThis method refers to the sponsor's use of data elements\nfrom a third party database, primarily that of a credit bureau or a government\nagency, to develop individualized questions to be used in validating the\nidentity of a student. Data sets may be made available to the sponsor for\ndirect verification but the sponsor assumes the risks and responsibilities\nassociated with securing this data, so it is preferable that the sponsor\nutilize the services of the data provider where verification can be made\nwithout the sponsor accessing the personal data from the third party database. At least one of the national credit bureaus is known to provide an identity\nverification service where verification is made without personal information\nbeing released by the credit bureau. Sponsors are expected to capture each\nthird party validation question and whether the question was answered\ncorrectly, including a date and time stamp. Verification transaction\ninformation must be stored electronically and available to the department for\nthe five years of the pilot study. Sponsors must implement security measures to\nensure that personal validation information is secured. DMV reserves the right to review and approve the use of a\nthird party database information for the purpose of validating student\nidentity, including any contracts, agreements, security protocols and policies, and may consult the third party credit bureau or government data provider\nwithout permission from or knowledge of the sponsor. Personal/Content\n\nQuestions\n\nShould sponsors opt to utilize phone contact, online\npersonal or content questions or utilize \"pay per view\" cable buttons, students\nwill be required to answer authentication questions correctly and within the\nprescribed timeframes as follows: Proposed Validation of Student Identity &\nParticipation\n\nType of Question\n\nNumber In Test\n\nBank\n\nMinimum # in\n\nCourse\n\nCorrect Responses\n\nRequired\n\nAmount of Time to Read &\nAnswer - PC Format\n\nAmount of Time to Ask &\nAnswer - Phone Contact\n\nPersonal identity\n30\n10\n7\n45 seconds\n30 seconds\n\nContent/environment\n100\n20\n14\n60 seconds\n45 seconds\n\nPersonal questions may be asked throughout the course, and\nat a minimum, at the beginning of each session logon. Students are limited by\nthe number of times they can incorrectly answer personal identity and\ncontent/environment questions. Questions will be asked as they relate to\nmaterial presented in each section, and can either be after video clips or at\nthe end of each sub-section or section. Students that fail to answer the\nminimum number of content/environment questions correctly can have additional\nquestions asked (adding to the minimum time requirement) so as to\nproportionally be able to answer a correct number of questions in a subsequent\nattempt as appropriate. Students will have up to 3 complete opportunities (for\na total of 10 personal or 20 content questions each) in order to \"prove\"\nparticipation. E-mail Contact\n\nShould sponsors opt to use email as a validation method, they will need to confirm that the email was \"received\", by providing to the\nstudent both the hyperlink to \"confirm\" registration or to link to the course\nupon acceptance of payment. Email contact can also be used to transmit user\nsign-ons and passwords in order to access the course. The purpose of email\ncontact is to send information necessary to access the course to a participant\nprovided address. The preferred method is for the user name and password to be\ntransmitted in separate emails, but mailing both in a single email is\nacceptable if a password change is required upon initial log on to the sponsor\nsite. Online Contact\n\nIn the event sponsors wish to use some form of online\ncontact with participants, the requirements of this option are: * Participants must identify themselves in a manner that\nwill allow them to be linked to the student participation database. * Online contact can utilize participatory tools available\non the internet including but not limited to instant messaging, online\nwhiteboards and collaboration software. * During online contact, sponsors can ask personal/content\nquestions or use this to provide online help. * Sponsors must clearly demonstrate how they plan to\nimplement and use this option, as well as how they plan to protect the\ninformation that is transmitted. Sponsors must not transmit private data using\nclear text; all private data must be encrypted and secured. Web TV/Pay Per View\n\nGiven the advent of interactive TV and the ability to\n\"vote\" using digital cable, sponsors who opt to deliver their course as a pay\nper view option, can use this technology to validate participation. This can be\ndone through the remote control by having students answer multiple choice\npersonal questions or content questions. Participants must be identified in a\nmanner that will allow them to be linked to the student ADM participant\ndatabase. Sponsors can also consider participants being prompted to call a toll\nfree number to answer personal and content questions at selected intervals\nduring the course. Other Portable Devices (Cell\n\nPhones/PDA)\n\nAlthough we do not know of an accident prevention course\nbeing delivered through a PDA or cell phone, the features and functions of\ntoday's devices seem to support the delivery of a course, albeit the screen\ndisplay is limited. Sponsors that opt to deliver their courses using this\nmethodology can couple the device with interactive use of phone buttons to have\nstudents answer both personal and content questions during the course. Future Technologies\n\nRecognizing the explosion of portable personal devices, DMV\nremains open to alternate delivery methods over the duration of the pilot. DMV\nwill continue to accept sponsors' applications, including technologies not\nspecified herein, for alternate delivery methods throughout the duration of the\n5-year pilot. Sponsor Application\n\nProcess\n\nParticipation in the IPIRP is voluntary; existing sponsors\nare not required to participate in the pilot. The two-step application process\nis designed to minimize development costs and potential delays during the\nreview and approval process, while ensuring that the finished product adheres\nto the mandated requirements. Step 1\n\nApproved sponsors that desire to participate in the pilot\nmust: * Complete an IPIRP application form (to be provided by DMV\nto all approved classroom sponsors when Part 141 Commissioner's regulations are\napproved). * Include a one time, $7,500 non-refundable application fee\nin the form of a certified check or money order, payable to the Commissioner of\n\nMotor Vehicles - IPIRP Fund. * Mail the application and fee to: NYS Department of Motor Vehicles Bureau of Driver Program\n\nRegulation, Rm. 412 6 Empire State Plaza Albany, NY 12228\n\nThe application will be carefully reviewed by DMV\nassociates to ensure completeness and adherence to the IPIRP requirements. It\nis anticipated that several follow-up discussions with appropriate sponsor\nstaff will occur as a result of the application submitted and that these\nsubsequent discussions will take at least one month. NYS reserves the right to\nreturn incomplete applications to sponsors for more information. Sponsors that\nhave their application returned can resubmit their updated application at any\ntime. The $7,500 non-refundable application fee only needs to be paid once\nduring the pilot program. Step 2\n\nOnce DMV associates have reviewed the application, and all\nnecessary questions have been addressed, the DMV will notify sponsors in\nwriting that they have been approved to proceed with development. Once the\nsponsor has completed their IPIRP development, they must submit the finished\nproduct to DMV as follows: * If internet based, sponsors should submit the URL (web\naddress) of the training, and 10 unique user names and passwords that can be\nused by DMV staff to review the curriculum. * If an alternate delivery methodology is used, sponsors\nshould submit 10 copies of the alternate medium that can be used by DMV staff\nto review the curriculum. * Regardless of method, DMV will be testing the sponsors\nproposed validation and participation methodologies, so sponsors must submit\nappropriate materials (hardware, software, phone numbers, questions and\nanswers, etc.) necessary for validation by up to 10 different\nassociates. * A bond, or letter of credit, in the amount of $100,000, naming DMV as a beneficiary. Applicants need not provide the bond or letter of\ncredit with their initial application materials, though this requirement must\nbe satisfied before DMV will grant final approval to conduct an ADM course. Sponsors that do not provide the bond or letter of credit with application\nmaterials will be advised in writing by DMV when all other application\nrequirements have been satisfied and approval is imminent. The sponsor must\nthen submit the bond or letter of credit in order to be finally approved. DMV\nwill notify the sponsor when course delivery may commence. The sponsors must\nsubmit proof of bond renewal on an annual basis. * The physical location(s) of the data server used to\neither deliver the course and/or store student participation data (detailed in\ndata collection requirements section) and the responsible person (and their\ncontact information) at this location. If the data server is out of state, NYS\nreserves the right to require sponsors to reimburse the state for the cost of\ntravel to this site, and to any other site where related data may be stored, to\nverify security requirements are being met. DMV anticipates that this review and approval process could\ntake upwards of 60 days to complete. The length of time will be dependent upon\nthe number of curriculums being reviewed at one time; DMV plans to assign the\nreview to multiple individuals, and will assign based on a first in, first\nreviewed order. DMV Review & Approval\n\nProcess\n\nAll applications will be logged-in based on when received\nand tracked during the various reviews completed (curriculum, security, background, etc.). As stated previously, these will be reviewed in a first in, first out order. Cooperation by the sponsor in answering questions, scheduling\nand hosting the security review, and providing follow up or supplemental\nmaterials requested (if necessary) will assist in getting the application\nprocessed as quickly as possible. Continuous delays, errors and omissions in\nthe application package will result in the application process slowing\ndown. Communication about application and programmatic\ndeficiencies will be reported to the application contact person. If the sponsor\nwould like this communication to go to multiple people, this must be noted on\nthe application form. DMV plans to review both steps of the submission\ncompletely, and will note all items found non-compliant upon completion of the\nreview, in writing to the contact person. Once a sponsor has successfully met\nall pilot requirements described herein, DMV will provide written approval\nallowing the sponsor to start the IPIRP/ADM course. DMV reserves the right to deny participation in the ADM\npilot if adverse material uncovered during the review indicates that sponsors\nare not of the high moral and financial character required to operate an ADM\nprogram. In the event DMV reaches this decision, written notice will be\nprovided to the sponsor explaining or decision. This decision will be subject\nto appeal. Existing approved NYS sponsors are allowed to partner or\ncreate a co-venture with another company to provide the ADM course, so long as\nthey have exclusive rights to deliver the course in NYS. In the event the\npartnership is with a non-NYS approved PIRP provider, the non-NYS provider\nwould not be eligible to offer the same PIRP course, in the event they opted at\na future date to apply to become a NYS classroom and/or ADM sponsor.
