  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 50.16 - Surveys, instrumentation and inventories\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Surveys. Each person who possesses a\nregistered laser shall make, or shall cause to be made, the applicable surveys\nrequired by this section and such additional surveys as may be necessary for\nsuch person to comply with the other provisions of this Part (rule) or as the\ncommissioner may direct. Such surveys shall include: (1)\nA survey of the output power or energy\ndensity of each registered mobile laser. Such determination shall be made by\nmeasurement or by calculation based on measurements made prior to initial use. If the laser beam is passed through an optical system, such determination shall\nbe made at the point of maximum power or energy density along the path of the\nlaser beam which is exposed to view. (2)\nA survey shall be made of all laser\nprotective devices, including safety interlocks, prior to initial use to make\ncertain that such devices are in good working order and have been properly\ninstalled. Note: For lasers installed or operated prior to August 1, 1972, the surveys cited in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision which are\nrequired to be performed prior to initial laser operation, shall be performed\nprior to the registration of such lasers. (3)\n\nAn inspection shall be made at least once\nevery six month of all safety eyewear in use to make certain that the optical\ndensity and type of filter is appropriate for the laser in use and to determine\nvisually that the eyewear has no optical defects. All safety eyewear found to\nbe deteriorated or defective in any way shall be immediately withdrawn from use\nand repaired if possible or otherwise discarded. (b) Instrumentation. All the necessary\nmeasurements performed in compliance with this Part (rule) shall be made with\ninstrumentation designed and calibrated for use with the laser that is under\nsurveillance. (c) Inventories. An\ninventory shall be made of all lasers in any laser installation and all mobile\nlasers at least once a year. Such inventories shall be kept available for\nexamination by the commissioner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n50.16\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
