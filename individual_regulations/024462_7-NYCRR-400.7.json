  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 400.7 - \"in lieu of\" moving expenses for business or farm occupants\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn lieu of actual, reasonable and necessary moving expenses, searching fees and actual direct losses of tangible personal property, a\nbusiness or farm operation is eligible for a payment equal to the average\nannual net earnings of the displaced business or farm, except such payment\nshall not be less than $2,500 nor more than $10,000 providing the following\nrequirements are met: (a) Business. The owner of the business eligible for relocation expenses must submit a\nwritten application as prescribed by the commissioner, with eligibility for\npayment contingent upon the State's determination that the business: (1)\ncannot be relocated without a substantial\nloss of patronage, herein defined as the average dollar volume of business\ntransacted during the two taxable years immediately preceding the year in which\nthe business is relocated, and\n(2)\nis not part of a commercial enterprise having at least one other establishment\nwhich is not being acquired by the State or the United States and which is\nengaged in the same or similar business, and\n(3)\nthe business contributes materially to\nthe income of the displaced owner of a part-time occupation in the\nhome. (b) Farm. The\nowner of a displaced farm operation must submit a written application as\nprescribed by the commissioner, with eligibility for payment contingent upon\nthe State's determination that: (1)\n\nThe farm\noperator has discontinued or relocated his entire operation at the present\nlocation, and\n(2)\nin the case of a\npartial taking, the property remaining after the acquisition is no longer an\neconomic unit as determined by the State in its appraisal process. (c) The department will calculate\na payment in lieu of moving expenses equivalent to the average annual net\nearnings. The term average annual net earnings means one-half of any net\nearnings of the business or farm before Federal, State and local income taxes\nduring the two taxable years immediately preceding the taxable year in which\nthe business or farm is relocated. Such earnings shall include any compensation\npaid by the business or farm to the owner and his immediate family during the\nbase year period. In the case of a corporation, earnings shall include any\ncompensation paid by the corporation to the owner of a majority interest in the\ncorporation. For purposes of determining majority ownership, stock held by a\nhusband and his immediate family shall be treated as one unit. (d) If the business affected can show that it\nwas in business 12 consecutive months during the two taxable years prior to the\ntaxable year in which it is required to relocate; had income during such period\nand is otherwise eligible to receive the in lieu of payment. Where the business\nwas in operation for 12 consecutive months or more but was not in operation\nduring the entire two preceding taxable years, the payment shall be computed by\ndividing the net earnings by the number of months the business was operated and\nmultiplying by 12. A taxable year is defined as any 12 month period used by the\nbusiness in filing income tax returns. (e) For the owner of a business or farm to be\nentitled to this payment, the business or farm must provide information to\nsupport the net earnings. State or Federal income tax returns for the years in\nquestion are acceptable as evidence of earnings. Any commonly accepted method\nof verifying earnings may be offered provided it grants the State the right to\nreview the records and accounts of the business or farm. The eligible person\nwill be notified in writing by the department regarding his eligibility and the\namount of the in lieu of payment, if any, will be set forth therein. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
