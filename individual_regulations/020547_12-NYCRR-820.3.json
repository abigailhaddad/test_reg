However, if a former employee employed\nafter the effective date of Labor Law, article 28, or an employee on indefinite\nlay-off requests information pursuant to Labor Law, sections 876(7) and 880(1), about a toxic substance that was not present in the workplace at any time that\nthe employee was employed there, then the employer shall so advise the employee\nin writing.
