(4)\n\nThe aluminum equivalent of the total filtration in the useful beam shall not be less than that shown below: Operating kVp\n\nMinimum total filtration (Inherent plus added)\n\nBelow 50 kVp\n0.5 mm aluminum\n50-70 kVp\n1.5 mm aluminum\n\nAbove 70 kVp\n2.5 mm aluminum\n(5)\nA device shall be provided which terminates the exposure after a preset time interval or exposure.

If patient or films must be held by an individual, that individual shall be protected with appropriate shielding devices such as protective gloves and a protective apron of at least 0.25 mm lead equivalent. No part of the attendant's body shall be in the useful beam. The exposure of any individual used for holding patients shall be monitored. Pregnant women and persons under 18 years of age shall not hold patients under any conditions. (2)\n\nGonadal shielding of not less than 0.5 mm lead equivalent shall be used for patients who have not passed the reproductive age during radiographic procedures in which the gonads are in the useful beam, except for cases in which this would interfere with the diagnostic procedure.
