(d) Hearsay exceptions; declarant\nunavailable. (1)\n\nDefinitions of\nunavailability. Unavailability as a witness includes situations in which the\ndeclarant: (i) is exempted by ruling of the\nmilitary judge on the ground of privilege from testifying concerning the\nsubject matter of the declarant's statement; or\n(ii)\npersists in refusing to testify\nconcerning the subject matter of the declarant's statement despite an order of\nthe military judge to do so; or\n(iii)\ntestifies to a lack of memory of the\nsubject matter of the delcarant's statement; or\n(iv)\nis unable to be present or to testify at\nthe hearing because of death or then existing physical or mental illness or\ninfirmity; or\n(v) is absent from\nthe hearing and the proponent of the declarant's statement has been unable to\nprocure the declarant's attendance (or in the case of a hearsay exception under\nsubparagraph [2] [ii], [iii] or [iv] of this subdivision, the declarant's\nattendance or testimony) by process or other reasonable means; or\n(vi)\nis unavailable within the meaning of\n\nMilitary Law, section 130.49(d). A declarant is not unavailable as a witness if the\ndeclarant's exemption, refusal, claim of lack of memory, inability, or absence\nis due to the procurement or wrongdoing of the proponent of the declarant's\nstatement for the purpose of preventing the witness from attending or\ntestifying. (2)\n\nHearsay exceptions. The following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the\ndeclarant is unavailable as a witness. (i) Former testimony. Testimony given as a witness at another hearing of the same\nor different proceeding, or in a deposition taken in compliance with law in the\ncourse of the same or another proceeding, if the party against whom the\ntestimony is now offered had an opportunity and similar motive to develop the\ntestimony by direct, cross, or redirect examination. A record of testimony\ngiven before courts-martial, courts of inquiry, military commissions, other\nmilitary tribunals, and before proceedings pursuant to or equivalent to those\nrequired by N.Y.S. Military Law, section 103.32 is admissible under this\nparagraph if such a record is a verbatim record. This subparagraph is subject\nto the limitations set forth in articles 49 and 50. (ii)\n\nStatement under belief of impending\ndeath. In a prosecution for homicide or for any offense resulting in the death\nof the alleged victim, a statement made by a declarant while believing that the\ndeclarant's death was imminent, concerning the cause or circumstances of what\nthe declarant believed to be the declarant's impending death. (iii)\n\nStatement against interest. A statement\nwhich was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarant's\npecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to\ncivil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant\nagainst another, that a reasonable person in the position of the declarant\nwould not have made the statement unless the person believed it to be true. A\nstatement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to\nexculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances\nclearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement. (iv)\n\nStatement of personal or family history. (a) A statement concerning the declarant's\nown birth, adoption, marriage, divorce, legitimacy, relationship by blood, adoption, or marriage, ancestry, or other similar fact of personal or family\nhistory, even though declarant had no means of acquiring personal knowledge of\nthe matter stated; or\n(b) a\nstatement concerning the foregoing matters, and death also, of another person, if the declarant was related to the other by blood, adoption, or marriage or\nwas so intimately associated with the other's family as to be likely to have\naccurate information concerning the matter declared. (v) Other exceptions. A statement not\nspecifically covered by any of the foregoing exceptions but having equivalent\ncircumstantial guarantees of trustworthiness, if the military judge determines\nthat: (a) the statement is offered as\nevidence of a material fact; (b) the statement is more probative of the point for which it is offered than any\nother evidence which the proponent can procure through reasonable efforts; and\n(c) the general purposes of\nthese rules and the interest of justice will best be served by admission of the\nstatement into evidence. However, a statement may not be admitted under this\nexception unless the proponent of it makes known to the adverse party\nsufficiently in advance of the trial or hearing to provide the adverse party\nwith a fair opportunity to prepare to meet it, the intention to offer the\nstatement and the particulars of it, including the name and address of the\ndeclarant. (e) Hearsay\nwithin hearsay. Hearsay included within hearsay is not excluded under the\nhearsay rule if each part of the combined statements conforms with an exception\nto the hearsay rule provided in these rules. (f) Attacking and supporting credibility of\ndeclarant. When a hearsay statement, or a statement defined in Mil. R. Evid. 801(d)(2)(C), (D), or (E), has been admitted in evidence, the credibility of\nthe declarant may be attacked, and if attacked may be supported, by any\nevidence which would be admissible for those purposes if declarant had\ntestified as a witness. Evidence of a statement or conduct by the declarant at\nany time, inconsistent with the declarant's hearsay statement, is not subject\nto any requirement that the declarant may have been afforded an opportunity to\ndeny or explain. If the party against whom a hearsay statement has been\nadmitted calls the declarant as a witness, the party is entitled to examine the\ndeclarant on the statement as if under cross-examination.
