  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 25.20 - Appointment or promotion of eligibles\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Appointment or promotion from\neligible lists. (1)\n\nAppointment\nor promotion from an eligible list to a position in the competitive class shall\nbe made by the selection of one of the three persons certified by the Chief\n\nAdministrator of the Courts as standing highest on such eligible list who are\nwilling to accept such appointment or promotion; provided, however, that where\nit is necessary to break ties among eligibles having the same final examination\nratings in order to determine their respective standings on the eligible list, appointment or promotion may be made by the selection of any eligible whose\nfinal examination rating is equal to or higher than the final examination\nrating of the third highest standing eligible willing to accept such\nappointment or promotion. Appointments and promotions shall be made from the\neligible list most nearly appropriate for the position to be filled. Persons on\na certified eligible list who are considered and not selected for appointment\nor promotion pursuant to this paragraph shall, whenever another candidate is\nappointed or promoted, be given written notice of such nonselection. (2)\n\nWhenever a vacancy exists\nin a competitive class position and an open competitive examination does not\nresult in an eligible list containing the names of at least three persons\nwilling to accept appointment, a person may be nominated for noncompetitive\nexamination for such position. If such nominee shall be certified by the Chief\n\nAdministrator as qualified, he or she may be appointed to fill such vacancy. The Chief Administrator also may designate an eligible list as a continuing\neligible list in accordance with section\n25.18\nof this Part. (b) Prohibition\nagainst out-of-title work. No person shall be appointed, promoted or employed\nunder any title not appropriate to the duties to be performed and, except upon\nassignment by proper authority during the continuance of a temporary emergency\nsituation, no person shall be assigned to perform the duties of any position\nunless he or she has been duly appointed, promoted, transferred, reassigned or\nreinstated to such position in accordance with the provisions of this Part. No\ncredit shall be granted in a promotion examination for out-of-title\nwork. (c) Trainee\nappointments. The Chief Administrator may require that permanent appointments\nor promotions to designated positions shall be conditioned upon the\nsatisfactory completion of a term of service as a trainee in such a position or\nin an appropriate, lower, training title or the completion of specified\ntraining or academic courses, or both. Upon the satisfactory completion of such\ntraining term, and of specified courses if required, an appointee shall be\nentitled to full permanent status in the position for which appointment was\nmade. Any appointment hereunder shall be subject to such probationary period as\nis prescribed in this Part. The employment of such person may be discontinued\nat the end of the term of training service if his or her conduct, capacity or\nfitness is not satisfactory, or at any time if he or she fails to pursue or\ncontinue satisfactorily such training or academic courses as may be\nrequired. (d) Seasonal positions. (1)\n\nPositions in the competitive class where the nature of service is such that it\nis not continuous throughout the year, but recurs in each successive year, except as herein otherwise provided, shall be designated as seasonal positions\nand shall be subject to the provisions of this Part applicable generally to\npositions in such class. Upon the expiration of the employment season, the\nnames of all persons employed in such seasonal positions shall be entered upon\na seasonal reemployment list in the order of their first appointment to the\ntitle vacated by them at the expiration of such employment season. Such\nseasonal reemployment list shall be certified at the commencement of or during\nthe next employment season, and the persons whose names appear thereon as still\nqualified shall be entitled to reemployment in such positions in the order in\nwhich their names appear on such list. Any person may be reexamined with\nrespect to physical fitness for the performance of the duties of the position, and may be disqualified for reemployment in the same manner and for any of the\nreasons applicable to the disqualification of an eligible on an eligible list\nresulting from open competitive examination. (2)\n\nThe name of any person on such list\nwho is not reached for reemployment shall remain on such list and shall be\ncertified, in the order of the date of his or her first appointment to such\nposition, during subsequent employment seasons; provided, however, that the\neligibility for reemployment of any such person shall not continue for a period\nlonger than three years from the date of his or her separation from such\nseasonal employment. A seasonal reemployment list shall not be deemed to be a\npreferred list. (3)\n\nWhere a vacancy occurs in a full-time position having a title and duties\nsimilar to those of a seasonal position and for which no appropriate open\ncompetitive eligible list is available, it may be filled by selection from\namong seasonal employees. For that purpose, the Chief Administrator of the\n\nCourts may certify, to fill such vacancy, the names of persons holding\ncomparable seasonal positions in the order of their dates of original\nappointment in such positions or, if the vacancy occurs at a time other than\nduring the employment season, the appropriate seasonal reemployment list. In\nsuch case, appointment shall be made by the selection of a person whose date of\noriginal appointment to the seasonal position is the same as or earlier than\nthe date of original appointment of the third highest standing person certified\nwho indicates willingness to accept such appointment.
