  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 418.5 - Cancellation or suspension of a license as a terminal operator\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 283-b(4), (5)\n(a) The license of any terminal operator in\nthe circumstances described herein, may be cancelled or suspended by the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance pursuant to the provisions of this section. A determination as to whether a license should be cancelled or suspended and\nthe duration of suspension will be made by the department on the basis of the\ncircumstances in each case. The department may, in its discretion, continue\nsuch license upon such terms and conditions as it may deem necessary in\nprotection of the revenues under articles 12-A, 28 and 29 of the Tax\n\nLaw. (b) (1)\n\nGenerally, a license will not be\ncancelled nor suspended unless the licensee has had an opportunity for a\nhearing (see subdivision [c] of this section for exceptions). A license as a\nterminal operator may be cancelled or suspended upon a licensee's: (i) failure to file a bond or deposit\nacceptable security (or increase the amounts thereof) as required by the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance; (ii)\nfailure to comply with any of the\nprovisions of article 12-A of the Tax Law or article 28 of such law with\nrespect to motor fuel, or any rule or regulation pursuant to article 12-A of\nthe Tax Law or article 28 of such law in respect to motor fuel; or\n(iii)\nupon a licensee's knowingly aiding and\nabetting another person in violating any of the provisions of such articles or\nof such rules or regulations in respect to motor fuel. (2)\n(i) A\nlicense as a terminal operator may also be cancelled or suspended if it is\ndetermined that the licensee or an officer, director, shareholder, employee or\npartner of the licensee who as such is under a duty to act for such licensee: (a) commits fraud or deceit in operating as a\nterminal operator or has committed fraud or deceit in procuring a license as a\nterminal operator; (b) has been\nconvicted in a court of competent jurisdiction, either within or without the\n\nState of New York, of a felony, bearing on such terminal operator's duties and\nobligations under any article of the Tax Law; (c) has knowingly aided and abetted a person, who is not registered as a distributor, in the importation, production, refining, manufacturing or compounding of motor fuel into or within New York\n\nState; or\n(d) has knowingly aided\nand abetted the distribution of motor fuel which the licensee has knowledge of\nas being imported or caused to be imported into or produced, refined, manufactured or compounded within New York State by a person who is not\nregistered as a distributor of motor fuel pursuant to article 12-A of the Tax\n\nLaw. (ii)\n(a) A felony for purposes of clause (i)\n(\nb\n) of this paragraph includes the conviction of a felony by\nany court in this State, the United States or any other state of the United\n\nStates. Provided, however, if a crime of which a person is convicted by any\nsuch court, other than a court in this State, is a felony in such jurisdiction\nof conviction but is not a felony in the State of New York, the conviction is\nnot deemed a conviction of a felony for purposes of article 12-A of the Tax\n\nLaw. Conversely, in the event that a crime of which a person is convicted by\nany such court, other than a court in this State, is not a felony in such\njurisdiction of conviction but is a felony in New York State, the conviction is\ndeemed a conviction of a felony for purposes of article 12-A. (b) If a conviction of a felony is\nsubsequently set aside or reversed upon appeal and the accused is acquitted or\ndischarged, any license as a terminal operator which was cancelled or suspended\nbased on such conviction may be restored upon application to the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance. In addition, if a person is convicted of a crime, hereby\ndeemed to be a felony, and such person is subsequently pardoned by the governor\nof the state of conviction or by the President of the United States, or if such\nperson receives a certificate of good conduct granted by the Board of Parole\npursuant to the provisions of the Executive Law for purpose of removing the\ndisability because of such conviction, the department may, in its discretion, on application and submission of satisfactory evidence of good moral character\nand suitability, relicense the person as a terminal operator. (c) (1)\nA\nlicense as a terminal operator may be cancelled or suspended without a prior\nhearing for failure to file, within 10 days after the date prescribed for\nfiling, a return or report under article 12-A of the Tax Law or for nonpayment\nof any sums due pursuant to article 12-A and articles 28 and 29 with respect to\nmotor fuel, if such returns or reports have not been filed and/or such taxes\npaid 10 days after the date a demand therefor is sent by registered or\ncertified mail to the terminal operator at the address given in such operator's\napplication for license (as same may have been amended in accordance with\nsection\n418.4\n[a]\nof this Part). (2)\nA license as a\nterminal operator may be cancelled or suspended prior to a hearing for failure\nto continue to maintain in full force and effect at all times the bond or other\nsecurity required to be filed with the Department of Taxation and Finance. If, however, a surety bond is cancelled prior to its expiration, the department, after considering all relevant circumstances, may make such other arrangements\nand require the filing of such other bond or acceptable security as it deems\nappropriate. (3)\nA license as a\nterminal operator may also be cancelled or suspended prior to a hearing if such\nlicense is transferred without written approval of the Department of Taxation\nand Finance.
