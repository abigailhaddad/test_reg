All employee\nassisted telephone calls will be placed and verified by the employee (usually a\ncorrection officer) assigned to monitor the inmate telephone call. (2)\n\nCompleting call. Once the employee has\nmade initial contact with the recipient of a telephone call and collect charges\nhave been accepted, the employee will signal the inmate to start the\nconversation. Note: Calls to locations outside the continental United\n\nStates, Canada, U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Guam and Central Northern\n\nMarianna Islands will not be made \"collect\" but will be paid for as specified\nin section\n723.3\n(h) of this Part. (3)\n\nTime\nlimit. Conversations are not to exceed 10 minutes. The superintendent may limit\nthese calls to five minutes due to logistical constraints, with the advance\napproval of the deputy commissioner for program services. When 30 seconds\nremain on the allotted time limit, the inmate and his party will be buzzed. At\nthe end of the allotted time, the call will be disconnected. (4)\n\nAlternative calls. Inmates may select one\nalternative person to call if their initial choice is unable to accept the\ncall. (b) Telephone\ncalls involving calls to the hearing impaired. Inmates may place collect\ntelephone calls to hearing impaired persons through the assistance of a\nchaplain or family services staff person, provided the hearing impaired persons\npossess the necessary telecommunications device. (1)\n\nThe inmate must submit a written request\nto the appropriate staff person for such a telephone call. The request must\ninclude the most opportune times for the call to be placed, the number to be\ncalled, and the name of the individual to be called. The time of the call may\nnot coincide with the inmate's program hours. (2)\n\nThe staff person will arrange for the\ninmate to place the collect telephone call and, as necessary, assist the inmate\nin doing so. A local telephone directory provides instructions for planing a\ncollect call through the New York Relay Center for a non-TTY (voice) user to a\nTTY user. (3)\n\nTelephone calls to\nthe hearing impaired may be time and/or frequency limited. However, each inmate\nwho has not lost telephone privileges is entitled to a minimum of one such call\neach calendar month for a minimum duration of 10 minutes, provided (s)he\nsubmits a request and the party called accepts the charges.
