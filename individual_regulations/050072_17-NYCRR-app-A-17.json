No individual\naction shall be considered a type II action if it would be located in a\nparticularly sensitive environmental area where an otherwise insignificant\nimpact could become significant as determined by the department. 1. All actions designated as type II in 6\nNYCRR\n617.12. 2. Minor\nreconstruction of an existing highway without making major capacity\nimprovements, including such work as: shoulder widening; adding auxiliary lanes\nfor local utility such as climbing, weaving, turning and speed change; and the\ncorrection of substandard curves, grades and sight distances. These projects\nshall qualify as type II only if the project requires: less than three additional acres of right-of-way per\nmile; less than 10 units of relocation per mile; and\nno physical effect on unusual or unique areas including\n\nFederal- or State-registered historic sites, wetlands, parklands and\nfloodplains. 3. Reconditioning and preservation of an existing highway. These projects are\nessentially maintenance type work with improvements to correct substandard\nfeatures. They include minor pavement and shoulder widenings, drainage\nimprovements, resurfacing and replacement or repair of deteriorated roadway and\nstructural elements. Minor amounts of additional right-of-way may be\nrequired. 4. Spot correction of\ndeteriorated or substandard elements of existing highway. These projects\ninclude minor work to accomplish a specific objective such as rehabilitation, demolition or replacement of deteriorated bridges or culverts; correction of a\nsubstandard feature. Minor amounts of additional right-of-way may be\nrequired. 5. Installation of new or\nupgrading of existing roadside appurtenances. These projects are designed to\nmaintain the operational standards of existing parkways and include\ninstallation of impact attenuators, highway lighting, guide rails, signs, delineators, intersection signals, traffic control devices, traffic\nsurveillance systems, pavement markings, at-grade railroad protective devices, fencing, telephone communication systems and landscaping. 6. Construction or acquisition of roadside\nfacilities in isolated areas where water quality, wetlands and historical or\narcheological resources are not significantly affected. These projects are\ndesigned to increase the comfort, convenience and safety of highway users and\ninclude construction of a service area, a rest area or comfort station, purchase of scenic easements and right-of-way for sight distance\npurposes. 7. The modification, reconstruction or expansion of an existing highway maintenance facility which\nwill not increase its size or usage by more than 50 percent. 8. Reconstruction, reconditioning or\nalterations to existing toll plaza facilities which do not expand their\ncapacity by more than two toll lanes. 9.

Review of environmental impact statements prepared by others. 13. The conduct of studies and the\nestablishment of standards, including: Engineering research studies to evaluate materials, methods, equipment and procedures. Establishing quality standards for engineering materials in\naccordance with accepted engineering practices. Conducting studies to determine efficiency and safety of\nexisting transportation systems. 14. Defining the scope of services, negotiating and executing contracts with consultants for professional\nservices. 15. Issuance or approval\nof traffic regulations which do not have a statewide or regional\neffect. 16. Training and training\nprograms. 17. The conduct, preparation or review of technical, engineering, economic, planning, environmental, toll collection, feasibility or research studies, reports or\nmemoranda which are preliminary to and may support the formulation of\nproposal(s) for action(s) which do not commit to a particular course of action\ninvolving major environmental impacts. 18. Planning, budgeting, cost estimation, preparation of work programs and other project process activities which do not\ncommit to a particular course of action involving major environmental\nimpacts. 19. Stockpiling and\nstorage of chemicals and abrasives for snow and ice control, including\nconstruction of storage facilities. 20.

Codes\nR. & Regs. tit. 17, Appendices, app\nA-17\n\nWith respect to capital construction projects, many\nactivities which might have been listed in this appendix as type II actions are\nthe components of a project. These components may occur in the programming\nstage, the planning stage, the design stage or the construction stage. The\nentire project will be considered the \"action\" for the purpose of SEQR\nanalysis. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
