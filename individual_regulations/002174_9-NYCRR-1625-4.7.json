Tit. 9 §§ 1625-4.7 - Limits on annual authority travel expenditures\n\nState Regulations\n\nTotal travel expenditures during a fiscal year are\nsubject to the approved budgetary limits and, in the case of travel to NAHRO, NYSARHO and NHC conferences, to the following limits: (a) Authorities operating a State-aided\nproject or projects having a total of 500 dwelling units or\nless............$650. (b) Authorities operating a State-aided project or projects having a total of more\nthan 500 dwelling units............$750. (c) Authorities operating a State-aided\nprogram of more than 1,000 units may be authorized an additional $100 for each\nkey administrative position upon approval by the division of a request by the\nauthority listing each position they so consider. (d) Authorities which operate both Federal-\nand State-aided projects will prorate such travel charges on the basis of\ncurrent ratios but the total charged to the State program during the fiscal\nyear cannot exceed the budget allowance and, if applicable, the limits listed\nin this section. (e) Authorities\nare responsible that total annual travel expenditures are within the approved\nbudget allowance and, if applicable, within the above limits. Approval of\nindividual expense vouchers or of specific travel requests by the division does\nnot relieve the authority of this responsibility. No travel will be performed\nnor travel requests submitted for approval by the division if the estimated\ncost of such travel will place the total annual travel expenditures above the\nbudgetary or cited limits. Authorities, however, may submit a request for a\nbudget revision and, under special circumstances, for an exception to the\nstated limits. Such requests must be submitted and approval obtained prior to\nthe travel. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1625-4.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
