  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-6.4 - Quarterly charges\n\nState Regulations\n\nAt the close of each quarter, a journal voucher shall\nbe prepared in the amount of the quarterly charge indicated in the insurance\nregister, for entry in the general ledger, debiting the applicable development\ncost or operating expense account and crediting account 1211, Prepaid\n\nInsurance. The quarterly charge is equivalent to the expired portion of the\namount of the premium for each policy which was originally charged to account\n1211. The portion of the premium charged to account 1212, Anticipated\n\nReturnable Premiums, shall not be charged to cost or expense, except as noted\nin section\n1642-7.5. For example, if the\namount of the original premium for a three-year mutual policy is $12,000 and\nthe estimated expense is $7,200, account 1212, Anticipated Premium\n\nRequirements, would be charged with $7,200 which would be written off to cost\nor expense at the rate of $600 per quarter. The charge to cost or expense for\nthe first and last months of a policy effective on other than the first day of\nthe month shall be computed as one-thirtieth of the monthly charge for each day\nthe policy was in effect exclusive of the 31st day of any month and including\nthe two extra days if the first month is February, (one extra day in leap\nyears). Where a policy is cancelled, the balance due the local agency for the\nunexpired portion of the premium is to be transferred from account 1211 to\naccount 1129, Sundry Accounts Receivable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-6.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
