  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 352-1.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Certified\nreference material' means a reference material characterized by a\nmetrologically valid procedure for one or more specified properties, accompanied by a reference material certificate that provides the value of the\nspecified property, its associated uncertainty, and a statement of metrological\ntraceability. (b) 'Continuing\n\nCalibration Verification' means an assessment of an analytical instruments\ncalibration drift and memory effects over the course of an analytical\nsequence. (c) 'Correlation\n\nCoefficient' means the statistical relationship between two\nvariables. (d) 'Cosmetic product'\nmeans any article\n(1)\nintended to be rubbed, sprinkled, or sprayed on, introduced into, or otherwise applied to the human\nbody or any part thereof for beautifying, promoting attractiveness, or altering\nthe appearance, and\n(2)\nintended\nfor use as a component of any such article. The term cosmetic product shall not\ninclude any personal care product as defined in this section for which a\nprescription is required for distribution or dispensation as provided in\nsection\n281\nof the\n\nPublic Health Law or section\n6810\nof the\n\nEducation Law. (e) 'Household cleansing product' means any product, including but not limited to, soaps and detergents, which contain a surfactant as a wetting or dirt\nemulsifying agent and are used primarily for domestic or commercial cleaning\npurposes, including but not limited to, the cleansing of fabrics, dishes, food\nutensils, automobiles, and household and commercial premises. Household\ncleansing product shall not mean: (1)\nfoods, drugs, and cosmetics, and personal care products as defined in this\n\nSubpart; (2)\nproducts labeled, advertised, marketed, and distributed for use primarily as pesticides, as\ndefined in article 33 of the Environmental Conservation Law; or\n(3)\ncleansing products used primarily in\nindustrial manufacturing, production and assembling processes. (f) 'Initial Calibration' means a\nplot of instrument responses to an analyte versus known concentrations of\nanalyte from certified reference materials. The initial calibration must cover\na range containing the applicable limitation set forth in section 352-1.3 of\nthis Part. (g) 'Initial Calibration\n\nVerification' means an assessment of the reference materials used to calibrate\nan analytical instrument by analyzing certified reference materials obtained\nfrom a second source. (h) 'Internal\n\nStandard' means a chemical substance that is similar, but not identical to, the\nanalyte or analytes of interest that are added to a sample at a known\nconcentration. An internal standard is used for quantitation of 1,4-dioxane and\nto account for matrix effects or variability in instrument response by\nnormalizing the response of 1,4-dioxane, or both, thereby decreasing\nmeasurement bias to the extent that their behavior mimics that of\n1,4-dioxane. (i) 'Laboratory\n\nControl Sample or Laboratory Control Sample Duplicate' means a clean matrix\nprepared and analyzed in the same analytical batch and in exactly the same\nmanner as the other routine samples. The laboratory control sample or\nlaboratory control sample duplicate is used to assess general method\nperformance based on the ability of the laboratory to successfully recover\n1,4-dioxane from the matrix. (j) 'Limit of Detection' means the minimum concentration of an analyte that can be\nreliably detected with a signal to noise ratio of 3:1 or greater. (k) 'Limit of Quantitation' means the minimum\nconcentration of an analyte that can be reliably quantitated with defined\naccuracy and precision, and a signal to noise ratio of 10:1 or\ngreater. (l) 'Manufacturer' means\nany person who (1) manufactures, produces or substantially produces any covered\nhousehold cleansing product, personal care product or cosmetic product for sale\nin the State under its own brand name or under any other brand name for sale in\nthe State; (2) sells in the State, under its own brand name, any covered\nhousehold cleansing product, personal care product or cosmetic product; (3)\nowns a brand name that it licenses to another person for use on any covered\nhousehold cleansing product, personal care product or cosmetic product sold in\nthe State; (4) imports any covered household cleansing product, personal care\nproduct or cosmetic product for sale in the State; or (5) manufactures any\ncovered household cleansing product for sale in the State without affixing a\nbrand name. (m) 'Matrix Spike or\n\nMatrix Spike Duplicate' means samples to which known concentrations of\n1,4-dioxane have been added before extraction and analysis. (n) 'Method Blank' means a clean matrix\ncontaining only the internal standard. The method blank is used to assess\nbackground interference or contamination that exists in the analytical system\nthat might lead to the reporting of elevated concentration levels or false\npositive data. Results from tests of the method blank should be below the limit\nof quantitation. (o) 'Multiple\n\nReaction Monitoring' means a mass spectrometry scanning mode whereby a\nparticular ion mass-to-charge is selected in the first stage, fragmented in a\nsecond stage, and specific product ions resulting from the fragmentation are\ndetected in the third stage. Multiple reaction monitoring typically results in\nincreased sensitivity of the instrumentation. (p) 'Percent Recovery' means the amount of\n1,4-dioxane analyzed relative to the known amount spiked, converted to\npercentage. (q) 'Percent Relative\n\nStandard Deviation' means a statistical analysis that determines how\nmeasurements in a data set are scattered around the average. Percent relative\nstandard deviation is defined as the standard deviation of the measurements in\nthe data set divided by their average, converted to percentage. (r) 'Person' means any individual, partnership, firm or corporation, or unincorporated association. (s) 'Personal care product' means any product\nintended for cleaning or cleansing any part of the body, such as the skin and\nhair, and including, but not limited to, hair shampoo, hair conditioner, soap, bath gels, and other bath products. The term personal care product shall not\ninclude any product for which a prescription is required for distribution or\ndispensation as provided in section\n281\nof the\n\nPublic Health Law or section\n6810\nof the\n\nEducation Law. (t) 'Relative\n\nPercent Difference' means a statistical analysis between two measurements\ndefined as the absolute difference between the two measurements, divided by\ntheir average, then converted to percentage. (u) 'Selected Ion Monitoring' means a mass\nspectrometry scanning mode in which only a limited mass-to-charge ratio range\nis transmitted/detected by the instrument. Select ion monitoring typically\nresults in increased sensitivity of the instrumentation. (v) 'Signal to Noise Ratio' means a measure\nthat compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background\nnoise. (w) 'State' means the State\nof New York. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
