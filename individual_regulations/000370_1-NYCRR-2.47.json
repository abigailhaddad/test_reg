  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 2.47 - Pasteurizers employing regenerative heating-item 16p(c)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Milk-to-milk regenerative heating. Pasteurizers employing milk-to-milk regenerative heating with both sides closed\nto the atmosphere shall comply with the following or equally satisfactory\nspecifications: (1)\n\nRegenerators shall be\nconstructed, installed and operated so that pasteurized milk in the regenerator\nwill automatically be under greater pressure than raw milk in the regenerator\nat all times. (2)\n\nThe pasteurized\nmilk, between its outlet from the regenerator and the nearest point downstream\nopen to the atmosphere, shall rise to a vertical elevation of 12 inches above\nthe highest raw milk level downstream from the constant-level tank and shall be\nopen to the atmosphere at this or a higher elevation. (3)\n\nThe overflow of the top rim of the\nconstant-level raw milk tank shall always be lower than the lowest milk level\nin the regenerator. (4)\n\nNo pump or\nflow-promoting device which can affect the proper pressure relationships within\nthe regenerator shall be located between the pasteurized milk outlet from the\nregenerator and the nearest downstream point open to the atmosphere. (5)\n\nNo pump shall be located between the raw\nmilk inlet to the regenerator and the raw milk supply tank, unless it is\ndesigned and installed to operate only when milk is flowing through the\npasteurized milk side of the regenerator, and when the pressure of the\npasteurized milk is higher than the maximum pressure produced by the pump. This\nmay be accomplished by wiring the booster pump so that it cannot operate\nunless: (i) the metering pump is in\noperation; (ii)\nthe flow-diversion\ndevice is in forward-flow position; and\n(iii)\nthe pasteurized milk pressure exceeds, by at least one psi, the maximum pressure developed by the booster pump. Pressure gauges shall be installed at the raw milk inlet to the regenerator and\nthe pasteurized milk outlet of the regenerator or the outlet of the cooler. The\naccuracy of required pressure gauges shall be checked by the regulatory agency\non installation, quarterly thereafter, and following repair or\nadjustment. (6)\n\nThe\nmotor, casing and impeller of the booster pump shall be identified, and such\nrecords thereof maintained as directed by the commissioner. All electric wiring\ninterconnections should be in permanent conduit (except that rubber-covered\ncable may be used for final connections), with no electrical connections to\ndefeat the purpose of any provisions of this Part. (7)\n\nAll raw milk in the regenerator will\ndrain freely back into the constant-level raw milk tank when the raw milk\npump(s) are shut down and the raw milk outlet from the regenerator is\ndisconnected. (8)\n\nWhen vacuum\nequipment is located downstream from the flow-diversion device, means shall be\nprovided to prevent the lowering of the pasteurized milk level in the\nregenerator during periods of diverted flow or shutdown. An effective vacuum\nbreaker, plus an automatic means of preventing a negative pressure, shall be\ninstalled in the line between the vacuum chamber and the pasteurized milk inlet\nto the regenerator. (9)\n\nIn the case\nof HHST pasteurization systems utilizing the temperatures of 191° F (89° C) and\nabove and holding times of one second or less, with the flow-diversion device\nlocated downstream from the regenerator and/or cooler section, the requirement\nthat the pasteurized product from the outlet of the regenerator or cooler shall\nrise to vertical elevation of 12 inches above the highest raw product level\ndownstream from the constant-level tank and shall be open to the atmosphere at\nthis or a higher elevation, may be eliminated, provided that a differential\npressure controller is used to monitor the highest pressure in the raw product\nside of the regenerator and the lowest pressure in the pasteurized side of the\nregenerator, and the controller is interlocked with the flow-diversion device\nand is set and sealed so that whenever improper pressures occur in the\nregenerator, forward flow of product is automatically prevented and will not\nstart again until all product-contact surfaces between the holding tube and\nflow-diversion device have been held at or above the required pasteurization\ntemperature, continuously and simultaneously for at least the required\npasteurization time as defined in section\n2.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (10)\n\nWhen culinary steam is\nintroduced directly into milk or milk products, as the means of terminal\nheating to achieve pasteurization temperature, and vacuum equipment is located\ndownstream from the holding tube, the requirement that a vacuum breaker be\ninstalled at the inlet to the pasteurized side of the regenerator may be\neliminated, provided that the differential pressure controller is installed and\nwired to control the flow-diversion device as described in paragraph (9) of\nthis subdivision. (11)\n\nWhen the\ndifferential pressure controller is installed and wired to control the\nflow-diversion device as described in paragraph (9) of this subdivision, the\nraw product booster pump may be permitted to run at all times, provided that\nthe metering pump is in operation. (b) Milk-to-water-to-milk regenerative\nheating. Milk-to-water-to-milk regenerators with both the milk and the\nheat-transfer water in the raw milk section closed to the atmosphere shall\ncomply with the following or equally satisfactory specifications: (1)\n\nRegenerators of this type shall be so\ndesigned, installed and operated that the heat-transfer-medium side of the\nregenerator in the raw milk section will, automatically, be under greater\npressure than the raw side at all times. (2)\n\nThe heat-transfer water shall be a safe\nwater and the heat-transfer water shall be in a covered tank which is open to\nthe atmosphere at an elevation higher, by at least 12 inches, than any raw milk\nlevel downstream from the constant-level tank. The heat-transfer water between\nits outlet from the regenerator and the nearest point downstream open to the\natmosphere shall rise to a vertical elevation of at least 12 inches above any\nraw milk in the system and shall be open to the atmosphere at this or a higher\nelevation. (3)\n\nThe heat-transfer\nwater circuit shall be full of water at the beginning of the run, and all loss\nof water from the circuit shall be automatically and immediately replenished\nwhenever raw milk is present in the regenerator. (4)\n\nThe overflow of the top rim of the\nconstant level raw milk tank shall always be lower than the lowest milk level\nin the raw milk section of the regenerator. The regenerator shall be designed\nand installed so that all raw milk shall drain freely back to the upstream\nsupply tank when the raw milk pumps are shut down and the raw milk line is\ndisconnected from the regenerator outlet. (5)\n\nNo pump shall be located between the raw\nmilk inlet to the regenerator and the raw milk supply tank, unless it is\ndesigned and installed to operate only when water is flowing through the\nheat-transfer section of the regenerator, and when the pressure of the\nheat-transfer water is higher than the pressure of the raw milk. This may be\naccomplished by wiring the booster pump so that it cannot operate unless: (i) the heat-transfer water pump is in\noperation; and\n(ii)\nthe\nheat-transfer water pressure exceeds, by at last one pound per square inch, the\nraw milk pressure in the regenerator. Pressure gauges shall be installed at the\nraw milk inlet and the heat-transfer water outlet of the regenerator. The\naccuracy of the required pressure gauges shall be checked by the regulatory\nagency on installation, quarterly thereafter, and following repair or\nreplacement. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n2.47\n\nSee Appendix 3 of this Title for further discussion\nconcerning methods of achieving the required pressure relationships within the\nregenerator. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
