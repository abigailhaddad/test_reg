  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 617.7 - Determining significance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The lead agency must determine the significance of any Type I or Unlisted\naction in writing in accordance with this section. (1)\n\nTo require an EIS for a proposed action, the lead agency must determine that the action may include the potential for at\nleast one significant adverse environmental impact. (2)\n\nTo determine that an EIS will not be\nrequired for an action, the lead agency must determine either that there will\nbe no adverse environmental impacts or that the identified adverse\nenvironmental impacts will not be significant. (b) For all Type I and Unlisted actions the\nlead agency making a determination of significance must: (1)\nconsider the action as defined in\nsections\n617.2\n(b) and\n617.3\n(g) of this Part; (2)\nreview the EAF, the criteria contained in subdivision (c) of this section and any other\nsupporting information to identify the relevant areas of environmental\nconcern; (3)\nthoroughly analyze the\nidentified relevant areas of environmental concern to determine if the action\nmay have a significant adverse impact on the environment; and\n(4)\nset forth its determination of\nsignificance in a written form containing a reasoned elaboration and providing\nreference to any supporting documentation. (c) Criteria for determining significance: (1)\n\nTo determine whether a proposed Type I or\n\nUnlisted action may have a significant adverse impact on the environment, the\nimpacts that may be reasonably expected to result from the proposed action must\nbe compared against the criteria in this subdivision. The following list is\nillustrative, not exhaustive. These criteria are considered indicators of\nsignificant adverse impacts on the environment: (i) a substantial adverse change in existing\nair quality, ground or surface water quality or quantity, traffic or noise\nlevels; a substantial increase in solid waste production; a substantial\nincrease in potential for erosion, flooding, leaching or drainage\nproblems; (ii)\nthe removal or\ndestruction of large quantities of vegetation or fauna; substantial\ninterference with the movement of any resident or migratory fish or wildlife\nspecies; impacts on a significant habitat area; substantial adverse impacts on\na threatened or endangered species of animal or plant, or the habitat of such a\nspecies; or other significant adverse impacts to natural resources; (iii)\nthe impairment of the environmental\ncharacteristics of a critical environmental area as designated pursuant to\nsection\n617.14\n(g) of this Part; (iv)\nthe creation of\na material conflict with a community's current plans or goals as officially\napproved or adopted; (v) the\nimpairment of the character or quality of important historical, archeological, architectural, or aesthetic resources or of existing community or neighborhood\ncharacter; (vi)\na major change in\nthe use of either the quantity or type of energy; (vii)\nthe creation of a hazard to human\nhealth; (viii)\na substantial change\nin the use, or intensity of use, of land including agricultural, open space or\nrecreational resources, or in its capacity to support existing uses; (ix)\nthe encouraging or attracting of a large\nnumber of people to a place or places for more than a few days, compared to the\nnumber of people who would come to such place absent the action; (x) the creation of a material demand for\nother actions that would result in one of the above consequences; (xi)\nchanges in two or more elements of the\nenvironment, no one of which has a significant impact on the environment, but\nwhen considered together result in a substantial adverse impact on the\nenvironment; or\n(xii)\ntwo or more\nrelated actions undertaken, funded or approved by an agency, none of which has\nor would have a significant impact on the environment, but when considered\ncumulatively would meet one or more of the criteria in this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nFor the\npurpose of determining whether an action may cause one of the consequences\nlisted in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the lead agency must consider\nreasonably related long-term, short-term, direct, indirect and cumulative\nimpacts, including other simultaneous or subsequent actions which are: (i) included in any long-range plan of which\nthe action under consideration is a part; (ii)\nlikely to be undertaken as a result\nthereof, or\n(iii)\ndependent\nthereon. (3)\n\nThe\nsignificance of a likely consequence (i.e., whether it is material, substantial, large or important) should be assessed in connection with: (i) its setting (e.g., urban or\nrural); (ii)\nits probability of\noccurrence; (iii)\nits\nduration; (iv)\nits\nirreversibility; (v) its geographic\nscope; (vi)\nits magnitude; and\n(vii)\nthe number of people\naffected. (d) Conditioned negative declarations. (1)\n\nFor\n\nUnlisted actions involving an applicant, a lead agency may prepare a\nconditioned negative declaration (CND) provided that it: (i) has completed a full EAF; (ii)\nhas completed a coordinated review in\naccordance with section\n617.6\n(b)(3)\nof this Part; (iii)\nhas imposed\nSEQR conditions pursuant to section\n617.3\n(b) of this Part that have mitigated all significant environmental impacts and are\nsupported by the full EAF and any other documentation; (iv)\nhas published a notice of a CND in the\nENB and a minimum 30-day public comment period has been provided. The notice\nmust state what conditions have been imposed. An agency may also use its own\npublic notice and review procedures, provided the notice states that a CND has\nbeen issued, states what conditions have been imposed and allows for a minimum\n30-day public comment period; and\n(v) has complied with subdivision (b) of this\nsection and section\n617.12\n(a) and (b)\nof this Part. (2)\nA lead agency must rescind the CND and\nissue a positive declaration requiring the preparation of a draft EIS if it\nreceives substantive comments that identify: (i) potentially significant adverse\nenvironmental impacts that were not previously identified and assessed or were\ninadequately assessed in the review; or\n(ii)\na substantial deficiency in the proposed\nmitigation measures. (3)\n\nThe lead agency must require an EIS if requested by the applicant. (e) Amendment of a negative\ndeclaration. (1)\n\nAt any time prior to its\ndecision to undertake, fund or approve an action, a lead agency, at its\ndiscretion, may amend a negative declaration when substantive: (i) changes are proposed for the project; or\n(ii)\nnew information is\ndiscovered; or\n(iii)\nchanges in\ncircumstances related to the project arise; that were not previously considered\nand the lead agency determines that no significant adverse environmental\nimpacts will occur. (2)\n\nThe lead agency must prepare, file and publish the amended negative declaration\nin accordance with section\n617.12\nof this Part. The amended negative declaration must contain reference to the\noriginal negative declaration and discuss the reasons supporting the amended\ndetermination. (f) Rescission of negative declarations. (1)\n\nAt\nany time prior to its decision to undertake, fund or approve an action, a lead\nagency must rescind a negative declaration when substantive: (i) changes are proposed for the project; or\n(ii)\nnew information is\ndiscovered; or\n(iii)\nchanges in\ncircumstances related to the project arise; that were not previously considered\nand the lead agency determines that a significant adverse environmental impact\nmay result. (2)\n\nPrior to\nany rescission, the lead agency must inform other involved agencies and the\nproject sponsor and must provide a reasonable opportunity for the project\nsponsor to respond. (3)\n\nIf, following reasonable notice to the project sponsor, its determination is the\nsame, the lead agency must prepare, file and publish a positive declaration in\naccordance with section\n617.12\nof this Part.
