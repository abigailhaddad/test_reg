  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 4-8.7 - Gas supply lines\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Bends. Bent supply piping shall have the bends smoothly made without any\nappreciable reduction in cross-sectional area and shall have no imperfection\noccasioned by the bending process. (b) Supports. Gas supply piping, tubing and\nfittings shall be rigidly supported with pipe hooks, metal pipe straps, bands\nor hangers suitable for the size of the piping or tubing. Gas piping shall not\nbe supported by other piping. (c) Rigid assembly. Gas supply piping to which connections are made for burners, pilots, lighters or other branch supply lines shall be so assembled and rigidly\nsupported as to prevent turning or displacement in making connections to the\nbuilding piping or in the ordinary handling of the unit. (d) Joint compounds. Compounds used on\nthreaded joints of gas piping shall be resistant to the action of liquefied\npetroleum gases. (e) Location of\nthe connections. Connections for pilot gas supply lines shall be so located\nthat pilot lines of semi-rigid tubing and pilot valves will not be\nunnecessarily exposed to damage hazards. (f) Iron pipe manifolds. When iron pipe is\nused for pilot burner manifolds, its nominal size shall be not less than one\nquarter inch, and when used for individual pilot lines its nominal size shall\nbe not less than one-eighth inch. (g) Semi-rigid tubing. When semi-rigid tubing\nis employed as gas conduit, it shall be not less than nominal one quarter inch\nsize. (h) Aluminum tubing. Aluminum\nsemi-rigid tubing shall not be exposed to condensate or to temperatures in\nexcess of 700° F. Aluminum semi-rigid tubing shall not be used to pass\nthrough insulating material of other than neutral reaction unless the tubing is\nadequately protected from the insulation. (i) Union types. Unions in gas lines for use\nwith liquefied petroleum gases or LP gas-air mixtures shall be either of the\nground joint type or a flanged joint having packing resistant to the action of\nsuch gases. (j) Test gage\nconnection. A one-eighth inch I.P.S. plugged tapping accessible for test gage\nconnection shall be furnished downstream from the last main line gas control\nfor measuring gas pressure at the burner. The plug used shall not be of the\nslotted head type. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n4-8.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
