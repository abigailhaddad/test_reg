  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-7.7 - Development Cost-Budget Control Statement, form DH-213\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Form DH-213 is a two-sheet printed form\nsupplied by the division and is shown as Exhibits 24 and 25 of Appendix S-11. Form DH-213 is used by the local agency for reporting to the division all costs\nincurred, whether paid or unpaid, for the development of a project and the\ncredits related thereto. The use of form DH-213 by the local agency in\nconnection with the preparation of certificates of purposes has been described\nin subdivision (b) of section 1646- 3.2. A report on form DH-213 shall be\nincluded with each quarterly financial report submitted by the local agency\nuntil three years after the date of substantial completion. From this date\nuntil the project has been declared physically completed, the local agency\nshall submit a schedule of charges and credits to development cost quarterly\nand a form DH-213 annually. The requirement to submit form DH-213 shall cease\nwith the quarter following the date of physical completion. (b) Instructions for the preparation of form\nDH-213 follow: (1)\n\nColumn 1, account\nclassification. (i) This column and the\nadjacent column for the account numbers shall reflect the standard\nclassification of accounts as employed in the approved development cost budget\n(see Subpart 1646-2). (ii)\n\nWhere\nthe 1460 group of accounts provides an account for additions and betterments, an analysis of these expenditures shall be listed in detail by items on the\nDH-213 in the available space in column one under the 1460 group of accounts. If there is no space on the form for the analysis, attach a separate schedule\nto the DH-213. (2)\n\nColumn 2, approved budget. The amounts entered in this column shall agree with\nthe most recent approved development cost budget (see Subpart 1646-2). Indicate\nin the heading of this column the date of preparation of the budget and whether\nit is a preliminary, final, or bond sale budget. (3)\n\nColumns 3, 4 and 5, expenditures. The\namounts to be indicated hereunder shall be all costs, paid or unpaid, incurred\nto the closing date of the period for which the report is being submitted and\nrecorded on the books of account. The amounts in column 5 shall equal the sums\nof the amounts in column 3 and 4. The source of the figures to be entered in\nthese columns is the cost analysis ledger and it follows, therefore, that the\ntotals of each group of accounts must be in agreement with the respective\ncontrol accounts maintained in the general ledger and the cost analysis ledger\nand that the grand total of column 5 shall equal the total development cost to\ndate, as reflected by general ledger account 1400. (4)\n\nColumn 6, contract numbers. Enter in this\ncolumn, where applicable, the numbers assigned to the various contracts. A list\nof contract numbers is included in the definition of account 1460 in Part\n1641. (5)\n\nColumn 7 and 8, budget\ncontrol. (i) The amounts appearing in column\n8 shall represent the most recent estimate of the amounts (other than contract\nawards) required to complete each development cost item. As contracts are\nawarded, the amounts of such contracts shall be recorded in column 7, and\ncolumn 8 correspondingly reduced by the amount of the award. The amounts\nentered in column 8 shall be periodically revised to reflect the local agency's\nbest current estimate of amounts, other than contract awards, required to\ncomplete. The award of a contract will, ordinarily, be a suitable occasion for\nsuch revision. (ii)\n\nWith respect to\ndevelopment cost items to which contract awards do not apply, the amounts\nentered in column 8, as periodically revised, will be reduced by the gross\namount of such expenditures made in the intervening period since the report\nlast previously submitted. Such gross expenditures will, of course, be\nreflected in the amounts entered in column 5. (iii)\n\nThe source of the amounts to be entered\nin column 7 is the contractors ledger (see §1645-5.2). It follows\ntherefore that the grand total of column 7 will always be in agreement with the\nbalance of account 2400, Contract Awards. (6)\n\nColumn 9, total anticipated cost. The\namounts to be entered in this column are the sums of the amounts entered in\ncolumns 5, 7, and 8. (7)\n\nColumn 10, anticipated underruns or (overruns) on budget. The amounts to be entered in\nthis column are arrived at by subtracting column 9 from column 2. Overruns\nshall be indicated by parentheses. (8)\n\nSchedule A (sheet 2), application of\nfunds. This schedule shall indicate the application of the development funds\nborrowed to the closing date of the period for which the report is being\nsubmitted. The amounts to be entered in this schedule represent balance sheet\nitems made up as follows: (i) Development\ncosts paid to the closing date, as carried forward from schedule B of form\nDH-213. The method of computing this amount will be explained under \"Schedule\nB\" below. (ii)\n\nDevelopment fund\nbank balances, as of the closing date. (iii)\n\nDevelopment fund disbursements made and\nnot charged or chargeable to development costs, such as for development fund\ninvestments, petty cash fund, prepayments, ineligible expenditures not yet\nreimbursed, etc. (iv)\n\nAmounts\nreceived and deposited into the development fund, but not credited to\ndevelopment costs. The principal such items consists [sic ] of deposits on\nplans and specifications received from contractors. (v) The sum of the amounts entered in\nschedule A shall equal the total development funds borrowed to the closing date\nof the period for which the report is being submitted. (9)\n\nSchedule B (sheet 2). In this schedule, the grand total of column 5, of form DH-213, which represents the total\ndevelopment costs incurred, whether paid or unpaid, to the closing date of the\nperiod for which the report is being submitted is adjusted for payables and\naccruals of development cost charges and credits to yield the total development\ncosts actually paid to date. The adjusting items to be entered in schedule B\nrepresent balance sheet items, as follows: (i) Audited vouchers payable. This is the\nbalance of account 2111D, Vendors, and Contractors--Development. (ii)\n\nContract retentions. This is the balance\nof account 2112, Contract Retentions. (iii)\n\nOther accruals and payables\nrepresenting charges made to development costs for which development funds have\nnot yet been disbursed. Examples are accrued interest payable on loan funds, accrued workmens compensation insurance premiums payable, accrued pension\ncontributions payable, income taxes withheld, etc. (iv)\n\nAccrued receivables representing credits\nmade to development costs for which the funds have not been received. An\nexample is accrued interest receivable on development fund\ninvestments. (10)\n\nSchedule C, summary of underruns and overruns. (i) Enter by account groups in column 1 of\nthis schedule overruns on budgeted amounts which have been authorized or\napproved by the division, whether through change orders or otherwise. No\nunderruns should be shown in this column, nor should anticipated overruns which\nhave not yet been authorized or approved. The difference between the budgeted\namount for contingencies (account 1490) and the total authorized overruns will\nappear in column 1 as the balance of contingencies unauthorized and should\nrepresent a conservative statement of the balance available, before actual or\nanticipated underruns, for future contingencies. (ii)\n\nEnter in column 2 of this schedule the\nanticipated underruns or overruns, by account groups, as recorded in column 10\nof form DH-213. The overruns entered in this column will therefore include both\nauthorized and unauthorized overruns. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
