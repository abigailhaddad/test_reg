Account numbers include four digits to the left of a decimal point which\nidentify primary account classifications, and two digits to the right which\nidentify secondary account classifications. (2)\n\nThe numerical coding system also\nprovides, for daily hospital and ancillary service revenue accounts only, that\npositions seven and eight can be used for designating the program in which the\npatient is being served as defined by the second and third digits of the daily\nhospital and ambulatory services numbers. (3)\n\nThe first digit of an account designates\nthe financial statement classification of the account: (1)\n--Assets\n(2)\n--Liabilities, Equity, and Capital or\n\nFund Balances\n(3)\n--Daily Hospital\nand Ambulatory Services Revenue\n(4)\n--Ancillary Services Revenue\n(5)\n--Other Operating Revenue and Deductions from Revenue\n(6)\n--Daily Hospital and Ambulatory Services\n\nExpenses\n(7)\n--Ancillary Services\n\nExpenses\n(8)\n--Research Expenses: Education Expenses; General Services Expenses; Fiscal Service Expenses; Administrative Services Expenses; Medical Care Administration Expenses; Other\n\nOperating Expenses\n(9)\n--Non-Operating Revenue and Expenses\n(4)\n\nThe second, third and fourth digits of\nthe daily hospital services, ambulatory services and ancillary services centers\nare the same for revenue and expense.

The third and fourth digits to the right of the decimal point may be\nused to designate the program in which the patient is being served as defined\nby the second and third digits of the daily hospital and ambulatory services\ncost centers. (f) OPERATING EXPENSE\n[ 2140 ] The expense coding uses six digits--four to the left of the decimal\nand two to the right. The digits to the left of the decimal represent the cost\ncenter incurring the expense. The digits to the right of the decimal represent\nthe natural classification of expense.
