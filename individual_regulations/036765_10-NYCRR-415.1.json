  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 415.1 - Basis and scope\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Statement of\npurpose. (1)\n\nNew York's residential health\ncare facilities are responsible for the health and well-being of more than\n100,000 residents ranging from infants with multiple impairments to young\nadults suffering from the sequelae of traumatic brain injury to the frail\nelderly with chronic disabilities. For the vast majority of residents, the\nresidential health care facility is their last home. A license to operate a\nnursing home carries with it a special obligation to the residents who depend\nupon the facility to meet every basic human need. (2)\n\nEach resident comes to the nursing home\nwith unique life experiences, values, attitudes and desires, and a singular\ncombination of clinical and psychological needs. In order to assure the highest\npracticable quality of life, the individuality of the nursing home resident\nmust be recognized, and the exercise of self-determination protected and\npromoted, by the operator and staff of the facility. The physical environment, care policies and staff behavior must at once acknowledge the dependence of the\nresidents while fostering their highest possible level of\nindependence. (3)\n\nIn writing a code\nof minimum operating standards for nursing homes, it is also critical that the\nregulator recognize the infinite diversity of the nursing home population. A\ncode intended to assure the highest possible quality of care and most\nmeaningful quality of life for all residents must not only accept, but in fact\ninvite variety in nursing home environments, policies and practices, and\nencourage creativity among nursing home managers and staff. (4)\n\nIn order to meet obligations to nursing\nhome residents, this set of requirements, to the extent possible, expresses\nexpectations for facility operation in terms of performance and outcomes rather\nthan by dictating structure and process. It is the intent of these requirements\nto grant a high degree of latitude and flexibility to administrators and staff\nwhile insisting upon conformance to fundamental principles of individual rights\nand to accepted professional standards. In those areas where a detailed process\nor procedure is mandated, it is based upon a firm belief that experience has\nproven the specific practice to be necessary in all cases to assure the high\nquality of care we expect nursing homes to provide. (5)\n\nIn addition to the emphasis on\nindividuality and self-determination, the code reflects certain precepts: that\nnursing homes should be viewed as homes as much as medical institutions, with\nthe resident's psychosocial needs deserving a prominence at least equal to\nmedical condition; that clinical interventions for the nursing home resident\nmust be part of a comprehensive approach planned and provided by an\ninterdisciplinary care team, with the participation of the resident, rather\nthan through a physician-directed acute care orientation; and that quality\nassurance is a work ethic rather than an oversight method or a\ndepartment. (b) General\ninformation. (1)\n\nNursing homes, which shall\ninclude all facilities subject to article 28 of the Public Health Law and\nproviding residential skilled nursing care and services and residential\nhealth-related care and services, shall provide such care and services in a\nmanner and quality consistent with generally accepted standards of\npractice. (2)\n\nIn accordance with\narticle 28 of the Public Health Law, nursing homes, as defined in section\n415.2\nof this Part, and which\ninclude facilities referred to elsewhere in this Title as skilled nursing\nfacilities, health-related facilities or residential health care facilities, shall comply with all the requirements of this Part. (3)\n\nNursing homes shall comply with\nconstruction standards contained in Article 2 of Subchapter C of this Chapter\n(Medical Facility Construction). (4)\n\nNursing homes shall comply with all\npertinent Federal, State and local laws, regulations, codes, standards and\nprinciples including but not limited to those pertaining to nondiscrimination\non the basis of race, color, national origin, handicap, protection of human\nsubjects of research and fraud and abuse and the Public Health Law, Mental\n\nHygiene Law, Social Services Law and Education Law of the State of New\n\nYork. (5)\n\nThe provisions of Parts\n700 and 702, of Article 1 of Subchapter C of this Chapter shall not apply to\nnursing homes. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
