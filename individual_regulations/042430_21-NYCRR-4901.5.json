  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 4901.5 - Enforcement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Removal\nfrom RGRTA transit vehicles, facilities, and properties. (1)\n\nAny person engaging in prohibited conduct\nunder the provisions of section\n4901.4\nof this Part may be refused\nentrance upon or ordered to leave RGRTA transit vehicles, facilities, and\nproperties by a commissioned law enforcement official, RGRTA personnel, or\nauthorized personnel of a contracted service provider in accordance with the\nterms of the applicable service contract. Failure to comply with such a removal\norder may be grounds for arrest and prosecution. (b) Exclusion from service. Except as provided in paragraph (5) of this subdivision\nimmediate refusal or removal, RGRTA employees shall not continually refuse\nservice to anyone who has not been formally excluded from RGRTA service\npursuant to the application of RGRTA's rules of conduct or a court\norder. (1)\n\nBasis for exclusion. (i) Engaging in prohibited conduct under\nsection\n4901.4\nof this Part shall be cause\nfor excluding a person from the privilege of entering and using all or any part\nof RGRTA transit vehicles, facilities, and properties including the RTS transit\ncenter for a period as determined by RGRTA based on the number of violations in\na period of five years, and/or the severity of the violation(s). (2)\n\nNotice procedure. (i) The RGRTA chief executive officer, or\nhis/her designee, shall give written notice, by personal delivery, certified\nmail, or regular U.S. mail, addressed to the person's last known address to any\nperson to be excluded from RGRTA transit vehicles, facilities and properties. The notice shall specify the reason for exclusion, places and duration of the\nexclusion, the effective date of the exclusion, the appeal process, and provide\nthe person an opportunity to respond in person, by telephone or in writing, to\nthe proposed action within five business days of actual or constructive receipt\nof the notice by the person being excluded. (ii)\n\nExclusion shall commence on the sixth\nbusiness day after actual or constructive receipt of the notice by the person\nbeing excluded, unless the person has timely requested an administrative review\nof the notice. In the case of administrative review, the RGRTA chief executive\nofficer, or his/her designee, shall review the exclusion and shall render a\nwritten decision determining whether exclusion is warranted, within five\nbusiness days from the date of the person's request for review. The written\ndecision is sent by personal delivery, certified mail, or regular U.S. mail\naddressed to the person's last known address. (iii)\n\nIf the RGRTA chief executive officer, or his/her designee, determines that exclusion is warranted, such exclusion\nshall commence and be effective upon actual or constructive receipt of the\nwritten decision by the person to be excluded. (3)\n\nConstructive notice. Receipt of a notice is construed to have been accomplished if\nthe person knew or reasonably should have known from the circumstances that\nhe/she is excluded from RGRTA transit vehicles, facilities and properties. Receipt of a notice is also presumed to have been accomplished three business\ndays after the notice was sent by personal delivery, certified mail, or regular\nU.S. mail. (4)\n\nImmediate\nrefusal or removal. (i) The notice procedure\ndescribed in paragraph (2) of this subdivision will be inapplicable if, in\nRGRTA's discretion, immediate conditions exist that: (a) pose safety or security risks; or\n(b) interfere with or impinge on\nthe rights of others; or\n(c) impede\nthe free flow of the general public; or\n(d) impede the orderly and efficient use of\nRGRTA transit vehicles, facilities, and properties; or\n(e) otherwise interfere with or seriously\ndisrupt RGRTA's transit related activities. (ii)\n\nIn such immediate conditions, persons\nengaging in prohibited conduct under the provisions of section\n4901.4\nof this Part may be\nimmediately reseated, refused transportation, or removed from RGRTA transit\nvehicles, facilities, and properties. The notice and administrative review\nprovisions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision are only available to persons\nimmediately refused transportation or removed from RGRTA transit vehicles, facilities, and properties for periods of 31 calendar days or more. (5)\n\nRefusal to comply. The refusal to comply with an order excluding a person from\nRGRTA transit vehicles, facilities, and properties shall be grounds for arrest\nand prosecution. (6)\n\nLength\nof exclusion. The following suggested exclusion lengths are guidelines to\nbe used by RGRTA in determining the duration of a particular exclusion under\nthe provisions of section\n4901.4\nof this Part and/or the\nseverity of the violation(s). The duration of exclusion is determined by the\nnumber of violations committed over a period of five years. RGRTA reserves the\nright, however, to impose an exclusion of greater length for any violation\nwhere the severity of the violation warrants it, even if it is the first\nviolation: (i) first violation = 7 or\n30 days exclusion; (ii)\nsecond\nviolation = 30 or 60 days exclusion; (iii)\nthird violation = 90 days\nexclusion; (iv)\neach successive\nviolation occurring in a 5 year period = 180 days exclusion. (7)\n\nAppeal procedure. The\nfollowing appeal process shall be provided to any person excluded from RGRTA\ntransit vehicles, facilities or properties for a period of 31 days or more. Not\nlater than 10 calendar days after commencement of the exclusion, an excluded\nperson may appeal in writing to the RGRTA chief executive officer or his/her\ndesignee, for de novo review (a new review) of the exclusion. Commencement of\nthe exclusion shall be defined as the date upon which the exclusion became\neffective and shall be determined by RGRTA's official records. The appellant\nmay request a hearing or may request review without a hearing based on a\nwritten statement setting forth the reasons why the exclusion is invalid or\nimproper. If the excluded person is unable to respond in written format, RGRTA\nwill make reasonable accommodation to allow due process. The chief executive\nofficer shall convene a Hearing Panel comprised of three persons selected as\nfollows: (i) the director of transit center\nand field operations or designee; (ii)\nthe manager of field operations or\ndesignee; (iii)\nthe director of RTS\nbus operations or designee; or\n(iv)\na person selected from the RGRTA staff by the chief operating officer or\ndesignee. The said RGRTA staff person shall be a person other than the\nchief executive officer. The decision of the majority of the members of the\nhearing panel shall be the decision of the hearing panel. The hearing panel\nshall hear the appeal-or if no hearing is requested, review the matter based\nupon the record-and render a written decision within 20 calendar days after the\nreceipt of the appeal. The decision of the hearing panel shall be\nfinal. (8)\n\nHearing. If a hearing is requested, the hearing shall be held within 20\ncalendar days after receipt of the appeal, and a written decision shall be\nrendered within 20 calendar days after the hearing. Exclusions shall not be\nstayed during the appeal process. If an appellant requires public\ntransportation services to attend the hearing, the appellant shall contact the\nRGRTA chief executive officer, or his/her designee, five business days prior to\nthe hearing date, and RGRTA shall make arrangements to provide the necessary\npublic transportation services for the appellant. (9)\n\nOther laws not limited. The enforcement\nof this section is not intended to limit, in any manner, the enforcement of any\napplicable Federal, State or municipal laws, provided RGRTA is not authorized\nto assist a patron or employee in enforcing a court order prohibiting or\nrestricting contact with any other person other than to notify appropriate law\nenforcement personnel via RGRTA's radio control/dispatch or security. (c) Liability. Nothing in this section shall create a duty to any person on\nthe part of RGRTA or form any basis for liability on the part of RGRTA, its\nofficers, agents, or employees. The obligation to comply with this section is\nsolely that of any person entering and using RGRTA transit vehicles, facilities, and properties and RGRTA's enforcement of this section is\ndiscretionary not mandatory.
