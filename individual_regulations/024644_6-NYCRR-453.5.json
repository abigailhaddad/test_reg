  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 453.5 - Measurement procedure; stationary test\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn accordance with the rules in this Part, a measurement\nshall be made of the sound level generated by a stationary motor vehicle as\nfollows: (a) Park the motor vehicle on\nthe test site as specified in section\n453.2\nof this Part. If the motor\nvehicle is a combination of vehicles, park the combination so that the\nlongitudinal centerlines of the towing vehicle and the towed vehicle or\nvehicles are in substantial alignment. (b) Turn off all auxiliary equipment which is\ninstalled on the motor vehicle and which is designed to operate under normal\nconditions only when the vehicle is operating at a speed of five mph (eight\nkph) or less. Examples of such equipment include cranes, asphalt spreaders, liquid or slurry pumps, auxiliary air compressors, welders and trash\ncompactors. (c) If the motor\nvehicle's engine radiator fan drive is equipped with a clutch or similar device\nthat automatically either reduces the rotational speed of the fan or completely\ndisengages the fan from its power source in response to reduced engine cooling\nloads, park the vehicle before testing, with its engine running at high idle or\nany other speed the operator may choose, for sufficient time, but not more than\n10 minutes, to permit the engine radiator fan to automatically disengage when\nthe vehicle's noise emissions are measured under stationary test. (d) With the motor vehicle's transmission in\nneutral and its clutch engaged, rapidly accelerate the vehicle's engine from\nidle to its maximum governed speed with wide-open throttle. Return the engine's\nspeed to idle. (e) Observe the\nmaximum reading on the sound level measurement system during the time the\nprocedures specified in subdivision (d) of this section are followed. Record\nthat reading, if the reading has not been influenced by extraneous noise\nsources such as motor vehicles operating on adjacent roadways. (f) Repeat the procedures specified in\nsubdivisions (d) and (e) of this section until the first two maximum sound\nlevel readings that are within two dB(A) of each other are recorded. Numerically average those two maximum sound level readings. When appropriate, correct the average figure in accordance with Part 454 of this Title. (g) The average figure, corrected as\nappropriate, contained in accordance with subdivision (f) of this section, is\nthe sound level generated by the motor vehicle for the purpose of determining\nwhether it conforms to the sound level limit set forth in section 38(3)(b) of\nthe New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law. (Table 1 in section\n450.3\nlists the range of maximum\npermissible sound level readings for various test conditions.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n453.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
