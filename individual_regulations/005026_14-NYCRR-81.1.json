  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 81.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part is\nintended to promote the application of the most effective methods by which the\nmentally retarded may be helped to achieve maximum self-sufficiency while\nassuring their safety and general well-being. (b) The Mental Hygiene Law requires the\ncertification of any residential facility operated by an individual, association, corporation, or public or private agency to provide examination, diagnosis, treatment, rehabilitation or training to people with subaverage\nintellectual functioning which originates during the developmental period and\nis associated with impairment in adaptive behavior. A number of terms are in\ncommon usage to designate such facilities, among them being residential\nfacility for the mentally retarded, home for children, training center, and\nschool for exceptional children. In an effort to make more comfortable their\nutilization by the mentally retarded, some schools for the mentally retarded\nhave made use of less distinctive titles, some of which convey no indication of\ntheir purpose. (1)\n\nWhile affectionate\nattention and concern are necessary to the mentally retarded for them to\nthrive, those settings which purposefully replicate community or family living\nand provide only domestic care and comfort but no specialized programs are not\nconsidered eligible for certification under this Part. (2)\n\nWhile both mentally retarded and\nemotionally disturbed children may benefit by a number of similar methods of\ncare and treatment, and in consideration of the significant degree of\nspecificity which is equally important, the department intends this Part to\napply to facilities which provide services specifically for the mentally\nretarded. Any exceptions will be clearly specified upon the operating\ncertificate, based upon appropriate modifications in the program acceptable to\nthe department. (c) This\n\nPart prescribes standards for certification. Certification of itself does not\nconfer eligibility to receive financial support from any governmental\nsource. (d) It is the intent of\nthis Part to foster increased responsibility of schools for the mentally\nretarded to evaluate and review their own services. This Part does not\nstipulate any specific modalities of care, staff training and experience or\nnumbers, or admission criteria. They require, however, that the school prepare\nan adequate plan for services which addresses these issues and establishes\norganization policies and procedures which will facilitate implementation of\nthe plan. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14\n§\n81.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
