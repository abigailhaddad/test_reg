  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.16 - Pooling of keogh retirement accounts into a general investment pool\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Banking Department was asked whether §237(7) of the\n\nBanking Law permits a savings bank to pool the Keogh retirement accounts for\nwhich it serves as trustee into a combined \"Keogh Fund\". The assets of the Fund\nwould consist of various passbook accounts and time deposits issued by the\nsavings bank. The legislative history of § 237(7) indicates that the\nlegislature did not intend to permit savings banks which accept Keogh deposits\nto exercise any investment discretion with respect thereto and that the duties\nof the savings bank were to be strictly ministerial. In 1965, the Governor\nvetoed a bill which would have permitted savings banks to act as trustees for\n\nKeogh Retirement Plans which lacked any limitation on the investment which\ncould be made by the trustees of the Plans. Legislation empowering savings\nbanks to act as trustees for these accounts was enacted in 1966. The\ndepartmental memorandum in support of the legislation indicated that the\ntrustee's functions would consist merely of depositing the employer's annual\ncontributions in a savings account and making such distributions from the\naccount as were directed by the trust instrument. Implementation of the savings bank's proposal would result in\ngreater fiduciary responsibilities than contemplated by the Banking Law. The\nadministrator of the Fund would determine the nature and maturities of the\naccounts in which the assets of the Fund were to be invested. In so doing, it\nwould be exercising the very type of discretionary power that was denied to\nsavings banks in 1965. The 1966 legislation contemplated that a savings bank would\nbe a trustee in name only. The limited fiduciary power granted thereby was\nintended to permit individuals eligible for a Keogh plan to place their pension\ncontributions in thrift institutions. Although called a trustee, the savings\nbank was intended to serve solely as a custodian. In light of the foregoing, the Department concluded that the\nsavings bank did not have the statutory authority to pool the assets of the\nseparate Keogh accounts into a combined fund for investment purposes.
