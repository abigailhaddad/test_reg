  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 151.3 - Maximum contributions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\naggregate amount of contributions that can be made under the program for any\ndesignated beneficiary shall not exceed $100,000, the amount established by\nsection\n695-e\n(14)(a)\nof the Education Law. The qualified\nhigher education expenses of a four year undergraduate education at an\naccredited private educational institution located in New York, attendance at\nwhich is among the most costly, are currently in excess of the $100,000 limit\non contributions. If the Comptroller and HESC jointly determine that qualified\nhigher education expenses of a four year undergraduate education at an\naccredited private educational institution located in New York, attendance at\nwhich is among the most costly, are less than $100,000, they shall reduce the\nlimit on the aggregate amount of contributions to the amount so determined to\nensure continuous compliance with section 529(b)(7) of the code and the\ntreasury regulations thereunder. If the permissible aggregate amount of\ncontributions is so reduced, notice of such reduction shall be provided to\naccount owners not less than six months prior to the effective date of the\nreduction. (b) The program manager\nshall monitor contributions so as to prevent contributions to any account for a\ndesignated beneficiary when the cumulative contributions to all accounts for\nsuch designated beneficiary equal $100,000. Any amount tendered as a\ncontribution, or portion of a contribution, that if accepted as a contribution\nwould cause aggregate contributions for any designated beneficiary to be in\nexcess of $100,000 shall be rejected as a contribution, and shall be directly\nreturned by the program manager to the account owner. (c) Transfers will not be permitted to the\nextent that they would cause the aggregate contributions for all accounts for\nthe same designated beneficiary to exceed $100,000. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n151.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
