  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 360-5.7 - Pending of disability cases\n\nState Regulations\n\nDisability status must be determined within 90 days of\nthe date of application. This time standard applies except in unusual\ncircumstances (e.g., where the agency cannot reach a decision because of\nfailure or delay on the part of the applicant or an examining physician, or\nbecause of some administrative or other emergency that could not be controlled\nby the agency). This pending period for acting on applications or\nredeterminations of eligibility must not be used as a waiting period before\ngranting MA. Furthermore, if it is necessary to pend a case beyond this 90-day\nperiod, this will not be a basis for denying MA to an applicant or for\nterminating assistance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§§\n360-5.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
