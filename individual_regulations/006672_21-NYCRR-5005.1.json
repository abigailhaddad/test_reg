(b) The system\nshall not be obliged to inquire as to the competency of the member. If the\nsystem, however, receives information which, in the system's sole judgment, raises a question as to the member's competency, the system may, in its sole\ndiscretion, take such actions as it may deem appropriate including, but not\nlimited to, requiring a statement, completed by a qualified physician, attesting to the member's competence to file a retirement\napplication. (c) A duly appointed\nguardian of the person or the property of a member may file an application on\nbehalf of a member, provided such guardian has been authorized to do so by the\ncourt which appointed such guardian. A certified copy of the court order must\nbe submitted to the system.
