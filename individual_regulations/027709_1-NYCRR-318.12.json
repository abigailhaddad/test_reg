Where necessary\nto avoid adulteration of edible products, separate equipment shall be provided\nfor the uninspected article. To assure the maintenance of sanitary conditions\nin the edible product departments, the operations incident to the manufacture\nof the uninspected article will be subjected to the same sanitary requirements\nthat apply to all operations in edible product departments. The manufacture of\nthe uninspected article shall be limited to those hours during which the\nestablishment operates under inspectional supervision; and there shall be no\nhandling, other than receiving at the official establishment, of any of the\nproduct ingredient of the uninspected article, other than during the regular\nhours of inspection. The materials used in the manufacture of the uninspected\narticle shall not be used so as to interfere with the inspection of edible\nproduct or the maintenance of sanitary conditions in the department or render\nany edible product adulterated. The meat, meat by-products, and meat food\nproduct ingredients of the uninspected article may be admitted into any edible\nproducts department of an official establishment only if they are NYSDA&M\nor United States inspected and passed. Products within section 314.11 of this\n\nArticle or parts of carcasses of kinds not permitted under the regulations in\nthis Article to be prepared for human food (e.g., lungs or intestines), which\nare produced at any official establishment, may be brought into the inedible\nproducts department of any official establishment for use in uninspected\narticles under this section. The uninspected article may be stored in, and\ndistributed from, edible product departments: provided, that adequate\nfacilities are furnished, there is no interference with the maintenance of\nsanitary conditions, and such article is properly identified. (b) When dog food or similar uninspected\narticle is manufactured in a part of an official establishment other than an\nedible product department, the area in which the article is manufactured shall\nbe separated from edible product departments in the manner required for\nseparation between edible product departments and inedible product departments. Sufficient space must be allotted and adequate equipment provided so that the\nmanufacture of the uninspected articles does not interfere with the proper\nfunctioning of the other operations at the establishment. Except as provided in\nsection 314.11 of this Article, nothing in this subdivision shall be construed\nas permitting any deviation from the requirement that dead animals, condemned\nproduct, and similar materials of whatever origin, must be placed in the\ninedible product rendering equipment, and without undue delay. The manufacture\nof the uninspected article must be such as not to interfere with the\nmaintenance of general sanitary conditions on the premises, and it shall be\nsubject to inspectional supervision similar to that exercised over other\ninedible product departments. There shall be no movement of any product from an\ninedible product department to any edible product department. Trucks, barrels, and other equipment shall be cleaned before being returned to edible product\ndepartments from inedible product departments. Unoffensive material prepared\noutside edible product departments may be stored in, and distributed from, edible product departments only if packaged in clean, properly identified, sealed containers. (c) Animal food\nshall be distinguished from articles of human food, so as to avoid distribution\nof such animal food as human food.
