  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 455.44 - Acquired immune deficiency syndrome\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis functional reporting center must contain all the\nexpenses associated with the care of individuals with AIDS, AIDS-related\ncomplex, and those diagnosed with other human immunodeficiency virus-related\nillnesses in a discrete AIDS unit within a residential health care facility or\nin a free-standing designated AIDS center. Costs associated with AIDS patients\nin designated or undesignated AIDS beds in an existing non-AIDS unit will\nremain a part of that unit's costs. (a) Standard unit of measure: number of\npatient days of care for all patients admitted to this unit. Include the day of\nadmission, but not the day of discharge or death. If both admission and\ndischarge or death occur on the same day, the day is considered a day of\nadmission and counts as one patient day. (b) Data source. The number of patient days\nshall be taken from daily census counts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n455.44\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
