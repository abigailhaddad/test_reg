When an eligible list has been in existence for less than one year\nand contains the names of fewer than three persons willing to accept\nappointment, and a new list for the same position or group of positions is\nestablished, the names of the persons remaining on the old list shall have\npreference in certification over the new list until such old list is one year\nold, and during such period such names shall be certified along with enough\nnames from the new list to provide the appointing officer with a sufficient\nnumber of eligibles from which selection for appointment may be made. Where an\nold list which has been in existence for one year or more is continued upon the\nestablishment of a new list which contains fewer than three names, the Chief\n\nAdministrator of the Courts may certify the names on the old list along with\nenough names from the new list to provide the appointing officer with a\nsufficient number of eligibles from which selection for appointment may be\nmade. (b) Certification on basis of sex. The Chief Administrator may limit certification\nfrom an eligible list to one sex when the duties of the position involved\nrequire sex selection as a bona fide occupational qualification. (c) Certification of lists for\ncourt positions. (1)\n\nCertifications for appointments to positions in the court service, regardless\nof the location thereof, shall be made from statewide lists of\neligibles. (2)\n\nThe\n\nChief Administrator of the Courts shall determine the eligible list most nearly\nappropriate for the position to be filled, and shall certify a sufficient\nnumber of eligibles from which selection for appointment may be made. When the\nname of any eligible is included in a certification for appointment, the names\nof all other eligibles on the list having the same final rating as such\neligible shall likewise be included in such certification. (3)\n\nWhen an eligible is\ncanvassed for or is offered appointment in writing, and fails to state his or\nher willingness to accept such appointment within seven business days after the\nmailing of such canvass or offer, or before the end of the second succeeding\nbusiness day if such canvass or offer is sent by telegram or express mail, he\nor she may be considered as ineligible for purposes of making selection for\nsuch particular appointment. (4)\n\nThe name of any eligible who fails\nto reply to an offer of or canvass for appointment, or who declines or\nindicates unwillingness to accept appointment, or who fails to report for work\nafter accepting an offer of appointment, may be withheld from further\ncertification from the eligible list. The name of such eligible may again be\ncertified upon his or her request, and the submission by such eligible of\nreasons satisfactory to the Chief Administrator for declination or failure to\nreply or to accept appointment or to report to work.
