Tit. 10 § 709.6 - Extracorporeal shockwave lithotripters\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This methodology will be utilized to\nevaluate certificate of need applications involving the acquisition of\nextracorporeal shockwave lithotripters (ESWL). It is the intent of the State\n\nHospital Review and Planning Council that this methodology, when used in\nconjunction with the planning standards and criteria set forth in section\n709.1\nof this Part, become a\nstatement of planning principles and decisionmaking tools for directing the\ndistribution of extracorporeal shockwave lithotripters. The goals and\nobjectives of the methodology expressed herein are expected to insure that an\nadequate number of ESWL units are available to provide access to care and avoid\nthe unnecessary duplication of resources. (b) The factors and methodology for\ndetermining the public need for ESWL units shall include, but not be limited to\nthe following: (1)\n\nThere shall be one ESWL\nunit for each 2.5 million residents within a health system agency's geographic\narea with a minimum of one unit in each health systems agency's geographic\narea. (2)\n\nEach applicant must\npresent evidence that an annual minimum utilization of 750 procedures shall be\nachieved within two years of initial operation, except those applicants located\nin a health systems agency whose geographic area contains less than 2.5 million\nresidents. (3)\n\nIn addition, each\napplicant applying to acquire an ESWL unit must meet the following standards: (i) Each applicant must demonstrate the\navailability of urologists who meet the definition of a qualified specialist. The applicant must also have competence in the provision of diagnostic, metabolic, and surgical services to patients with kidney stone disease. This\nshall include experience in the performance of renal surgery, percutaneous\nprocedures and ureteroscopy for the removal of urinary calculi. (ii)\n\nEach applicant must submit a plan to\ndevelop referral agreements with all facilities in the relevant service\narea. (iii)\n\nEach applicant must\nsubmit a plan to evaluate ESWL compared to alternative therapeutic modalities\nin terms of clinical efficacy, utilization and costs. (iv)\n\nWhere public need is established herein, priority consideration will be given to applicants that agree to serve the\nmedically indigent and patients regardless of source of payment.
