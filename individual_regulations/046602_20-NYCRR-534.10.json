  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 534.10 - Refunds and credits for vessel operators engaged in local transit service\n\nState Regulations\n[Tax Law, § 1119(b)]\n(a) Definitions. (1)\n\nVessel operator. For\npurposes of this section, a\nvessel operator\nis a person that\noperates a vessel used to provide local transit service in this State and that\noperates pursuant to a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued\nby the Commissioner of Transportation of this State or by a like officer or\nagency of the United States or pursuant to a contract, franchise, or consent\nbetween such person and a city in this State having a population of more than\none million inhabitants, or any agency of such city. (2)\n\nVessel. For purposes of\nthis section, a\nvessel\nis any type of watercraft with a\nseating capacity of more than 20 passengers that is used for the transportation\non water of passengers for hire. (3)\n\nLocal transit service. (i) For purposes of this section, local transit service\nmeans a mass transit service provided by\na vessel operator in which passengers are carried by a vessel from one point in\nthis State to another point in this State and in performance of which the\nvessel: (a) regularly picks up and discharges\nsuch passengers as scheduled, or at their convenience, at designated piers, slips, docks, or other landings along waterways, as distinguished from\nbuildings or similar facilities used as terminals or stations; (b) picks up and discharges passengers at\nterminals or stations, the distance between which is not more than 75 miles\n(5,280 feet per mile), measured along the route traveled by the vessel; or\n(c) picks up and discharges\npassengers as described in both clauses (\na\n) and\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph. (ii)\n\nLocal transit service does not include\ncharter, contract, excursion, sight-seeing, or other passenger service. Example 1: A vessel operator uses vessels to provide mass transit\nservice. The vessels pick up passengers from Terminal A and make scheduled\nlandings at designated piers throughout the city to pick up and discharge\npassengers before returning to the terminal at the end of the day. The terminal\nand all of the landings are located in New York State. The vessels are operated\nin local transit service. Example 2: A vessel operator uses vessels to provide mass transit\nservice. The vessels pick up passengers from Terminal A, proceed to Stations B\nand C, and continue to Terminal D. All of these facilities and all of the\nmileage are located in New York State. The distance along the route traveled\nfrom A to B is 80 miles, from B to C is 80 miles, and from C to D is 60 miles. Between Terminal A and Station B, the vessels pick up and discharge passengers\nat designated piers along the waterway. However, they do not do this between\n\nStations B and C or between Station C and Terminal D. Between A and B and\nbetween C and D, these vessels are operated in local transit service. Between\n\nStations B and C, however, the vessels are not operated in local transit\nservice because they do not stop to pick up and discharge passengers and the\nfacilities are more than 75 miles apart. Example 3: A vessel operator uses vessels to provide mass transit\nservice. The vessels transport passengers to and from Terminals A and B. Terminal A is located in New York State. Terminal B is located outside of the\n\nState. There are no scheduled landings at which to pick up or discharge\npassengers between Terminal A and the State boundary. These vessels are not\nbeing operated in local transit service because they are not carrying\npassengers from one point in this State to another point in this State. Example 4: A vessel operator uses vessels to provide mass transit\nservice. The vessels pick up passengers from Terminal A, proceed to Station B, and continue to Terminal C. Terminals A and C are located in New York State, and Station B is located outside of the State. The distance from Terminal A to\n\nStation B along the route traveled by the vessels is 20 miles, as is the\ndistance from Station B to Terminal C. There are no scheduled landings made\nalong the way. The vessels are operated in local transit service because the\ntotal distance traveled between Terminals A and C is less than 75 miles, even\nthough the route from A to C includes some mileage outside of the State. Example 5: Assume the facts in Example 4, except that the distance\nbetween Terminal A and Station B and between Station B and Terminal C is each\n40 miles. The vessels are not operating in local transit service because the\ntotal distance traveled between Terminals A and C is greater than 75 miles. The\nfact that the vessel operator carries passengers from Terminal A to Station B, a distance of 40 miles, does not qualify as local transit service because it is\nnot between two points within New York State. (4)\n\nVessel hours. For\npurposes of this section, vessel hours\nmeans the number of\nhours that all vessels are operated by a vessel operator in the performance of\nlocal transit service, plus the number of idle hours used to reach the point at\nwhich such service begins and from the point at which such service terminates. Such hours include only those hours operated in this State. (5)\n\nTotal hours operated. For purposes of this section, total hours operated\nmeans the\nvessel hours computed pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subdivision, plus the\nnumber of hours used in charter, contract, excursion, sight-seeing, and all\nother passenger service, which hours are not included in the meaning of vessel\nhours. Such hours include only hours operated in this State. (6)\n\nLocal transit service\npercentage. (i) For purposes of this\nsection, the\nlocal transit service percentage\nis the\nproportion that the vessel operator's vessel hours occurring in local transit\nservice in this State, as defined in paragraph (4) of this subdivision, bear to\nthe vessel operator's total hours operated in this State, as defined in\nparagraph (5) of this subdivision, for the calendar year immediately preceding\nthe end of the quarterly return period (\ni.e., the last day of\n\nFebruary, May, August, or November) to which a refund or credit under this\nsection relates. (ii)\n\nSpecial\ncomputation. For the first four quarterly return periods of a vessel operator\nthat is not engaged in local transit service in the preceding calendar year, such vessel operator shall compute its local transit service percentage by\nusing the proportion that such operator's vessel hours in local transit service\nin this State in the first three months of such operation bear to the\noperator's total hours operated in this State in such period. Example 6: Under the facts of Example 4 set forth in paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision, the vessel operator operates its vessels for 15,000 hours. Of\nthis number of hours: 4,000 hours are operated between Terminal A and Station\nB, of which 500 hours are operated outside of New York State; 4,000 hours are\nalso operated between Station B and Terminal C, of which 500 hours are operated\noutside of the State; 3,500 hours are operated in charter services in New York\n\nState; and another 3,500 hours are operated in sight- seeing services in this\n\nState. The vessel hours in local transit service is 7,000 hours, which is\ncomposed of the 3,500 hours operated is this State between Terminal A and\n\nStation B (4,000 - 500) and the 3,500 hours operated in this State between\n\nStation B and Terminal C (4,000 - 500). Total hours operated is 14,000 hours, which is all of the hours operated except the 1,000 hours that were operated\noutside of the State. The local transit service percentage is 50 percent (the\npercentage that 7,000 vessel hours bear to 14,000 total hours\noperated). (b) Refund or credit of taxes\npaid. A vessel operator engaged in local transit service is\nallowed a refund or a credit of taxes paid on the sale to or use by the vessel\noperator of a vessel, as defined in this section, and of parts, equipment, lubricants, diesel motor fuel, maintenance, servicing, and repair purchased and\nused in the operation of any such vessel by the operator. (c) Determination of the amount of\nrefund or credit. The refund or credit is determined in accordance with the\nfollowing table: If the local transit service percentage\nis: The refund or credit is: Less than 10 percent\n\nNone\n10 percent\n10 percent of the combined State and local taxes\npaid\n\nGreater than 10 percent, but less than 70\npercent\n10 percent plus the product of 1.5 times each whole\npercent in excess of 10 percent of the combined State and local taxes paid\n70 percent or more\n100 percent of the combined State and local taxes\npaid\n\nExample 7: Under the facts of Example 6, as set forth in paragraph\n(a)(6) of this section, it was determined that the local transit service\npercentage of the vessel operator is 50 percent. The vessel operator is\nentitled to a refund or credit of 70 percent of the combined State and local\ntaxes paid on items eligible for such refund or credit, computed as\nfollows: Initial 10% = 10%\n+40% * 1.5 = 60%\nTotal\n70%....... (d) Application for refund or\ncredit. An application for refund or credit must be filed with the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance and must cover a period of not less than\nthree months. (For the administrative provisions on applying for a refund or\ncredit, see section\n534.2\nof this\n\nPart.)\n(e) Records to\nbe maintained. (1)\nA vessel operator\nmust maintain records relating to its purchases and uses of all vessels and of\nall property and services described in subdivision (b) of this section. Each\nrecord must disclose: (i) the vendor's\nname; (ii)\nthe invoice\nnumber; (iii)\nthe invoice\ndate; (iv)\nthe amount of the\npurchase; (v) the amount of the\nsales or use tax paid; and\n(vi)\na\nbrief description of the item(s) or service(s) purchased. (2)\nA vessel operator must also maintain\nrecords that disclose: (i) vessel hours\noperated in local transit service in this State; (ii)\nvessel hours operated in this State in\ncharter, contract, excursion, sight-seeing, and other passenger service not\nincluded in vessel hours; and\n(iii)\ntotal hours operated within the State.
