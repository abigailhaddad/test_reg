  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.14 - Landfills\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to owners and\noperators of facilities that dispose of hazardous waste in landfills, except as\nsection\n373-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. A waste pile used as a disposal facility is a\nlandfill and is governed by this section. (b) Action leakage rate. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of landfill units\nsubject to paragraph (j)(1) of this section must submit a proposed action\nleakage rate to the commissioner when submitting the notice required under\nparagraph (j)(2) of this section. Within 60 days of receipt of the\nnotification, the commissioner will: establish an action leakage rate, either\nas proposed by the owner or operator or modified using the criteria in this\nsubdivision; or extend the review period for up to 30 days. If no action is\ntaken by the commissioner before the original 60 or extended 90 day review\nperiod ends, the action leakage rate will be approved as proposed by the owner\nor operator. (2)\n\nThe commissioner\nshall approve an action leakage rate for landfill units subject to paragraph\n(j)(1) of this section. The action leakage rate is the maximum design flow rate\nthat the leak detection system (LDS) can remove without the fluid head on the\nbottom liner exceeding one foot. The action leakage rate must include an\nadequate safety margin to allow for uncertainties in the design\n(\ne.g., slope, hydraulic conductivity, thickness of drainage\nmaterial), construction, operation, and location of the LDS, waste and leachate\ncharacteristics, likelihood and amounts of other sources of liquids in the LDS, and proposed response actions (\ne.g., the action leakage rate\nmust allow for decreases in the flow capacity of the system over time resulting\nfrom siltation and clogging, rib layover and creep of synthetic components of\nthe system, overburden pressures, etc.). (3)\n\nTo determine if the action leakage rate\nhas been exceeded, the owner or operator must convert the weekly or monthly\nflow rate from the monitoring data obtained under subdivision (l) of this\nsection, to an average daily flow rate (gallons per acre per day) for each\nsump. Unless the commissioner approves a different calculation, the average\ndaily flow rate for each sump must be calculated weekly during the post-closure\ncare period when monthly monitoring is required under paragraph (l)(2) of this\nsection. (c) Surveying and recordkeeping. The owner or operator of a landfill must maintain the\nfollowing items in the operating record required under section\n373-3.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart: (1)\non a map, the exact\nlocation and dimensions, including depth, of each cell with respect to\npermanently surveyed benchmarks; and\n(2)\nthe contents of each cell and the\napproximate location of each hazardous waste type within each cell. (d) Closure and post-closure\ncare. (1)\n\nAt final closure of the\nlandfill or upon closure of any cell, the owner or operator must cover the\nlandfill or cell with a final cover designed and constructed to: (i) provide long-term minimization of\nmigration of liquids through the closed landfill; (ii)\nfunction with minimum\nmaintenance; (iii)\npromote drainage\nand minimize erosion or abrasion of the cover; (iv)\naccommodate settling and subsidence to\nmaintain the cover's integrity; and\n(v) have a permeability less than or equal to\nthe permeability of any bottom liner system or natural subsoils\npresent. (2)\n\nAfter final\nclosure, the owner or operator must comply with all post-closure requirements\ncontained in section\n373-3.7\n(g) through\n(j) of this Subpart including maintenance and\nmonitoring throughout the post-closure care period. The owner or operator must: (i) maintain the integrity and effectiveness\nof the final cover, including making repairs to the cover as necessary to\ncorrect the effects of settling, subsidence, erosion, or other damaging\nevents; (ii)\nmaintain and monitor\nthe leak detection system in accordance with section\n373-2.14\n(c)(3)(iii)\n(\nd\n) and (c)(3)(iv) of this Title, and paragraph (l)(2) of this\nsection, and comply with all other applicable leak detection system\nrequirements of this Subpart; (iii)\nmaintain and monitor the ground-water monitoring system and comply with all\nother applicable requirements of section\n373-3.6\nof this Subpart; (iv)\nprevent run-on and runoff from eroding\nor otherwise damaging the final cover; and\n(v) protect and maintain surveyed benchmarks\nused in complying with subdivision (c) of this section. (e) Special requirements for\nignitable or reactive waste. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, and in subdivision (i)\nof this section, ignitable or reactive waste must not be placed in a landfill, unless the waste and landfill meet all applicable requirements of Part 376 of\nthis Title, and: (i) the resulting waste, mixture or dissolution of material no longer meets the definition of ignitable\nor reactive waste under section\n371.3\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(ii)\nsection\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (2)\n\nExcept for prohibited wastes which remain\nsubject to treatment standards in section\n376.4\nof this Title, ignitable\nwastes in containers may be landfilled without meeting the requirements of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, provided that the wastes are disposed of in\nsuch a way that they are protected from any material or conditions which may\ncause them to ignite. At a minimum, ignitable wastes must be disposed of in\nnonleaking containers which are carefully handled and placed so as to avoid\nheat, sparks, rupture or any other condition that might cause ignition of the\nwastes; must be covered daily with soil or other noncombustible material to\nminimize the potential for ignition of the wastes; and must not be disposed of\nin cells that contain or will contain other wastes which generate heat\nsufficient to cause ignition of the waste. (f) Special requirements for\nincompatible wastes. Incompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and materials\n(see Appendix 29, infra, for examples) must not be placed in\nthe same landfill cell, unless section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (g) Special requirements for liquid\nwaste. (1)\n\nBulk or noncontainerized\nliquid waste or waste containing free liquids (whether or not sorbents have\nbeen added) must not be placed in a landfill. (2)\n\nContainers holding free liquids must not\nbe placed in a landfill, unless: (i) all\nfree-standing liquid: (a) has been removed by\ndecanting, or other methods; (b) has been mixed with sorbent or solidified so that free-standing liquid is no\nlonger observed; or\n(c) has been\notherwise eliminated; or\n(ii)\nthe container is very small, such as an\nampule; or\n(iii)\nthe container is\ndesigned to hold free liquids for use other than storage, such as a battery or\ncapacitor; or\n(iv)\nthe container is\na lab pack, as defined in subdivision (i) of this section, and is disposed of\nin accordance with subdivision (i) of this section. (3)\n\nTo demonstrate the absence or presence of\nfree liquids in either a containerized or a bulk waste, the following test must\nbe used: Method 9095B (Paint Filter Liquids Test) as described in \"Test Methods\nfor Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (4)\n\nSorbents used to treat\nfree liquids to be disposed of in landfills must be nonbiodegradable. Nonbiodegradable sorbents are: materials listed or described in subparagraph\n(i) of this paragraph; materials that pass one of the tests in subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph; or materials that are determined by the department to\nbe nonbiodegradable through the Part 370 petition process. (i) Nonbiodegradable sorbents. (a) Inorganic minerals, other inorganic\nmaterials, and elemental carbon (\ne.g., aluminosilicates, clays, smectites, Fuller's earth, bentonite, calcium bentonite, montmorillonite, calcined montmorillonite, kaolinite, micas [illite], vermiculites, zeolites; calcium carbonate [organic free limestone]; oxides/hydroxides, alumina, lime, silica [sand], diatomaceous earth; perlite\n[volcanic glass]; expanded volcanic rock; volcanic ash; cement kiln dust; fly\nash; rice hull ash; activated charcoal/activated carbon); or\n(b) high molecular weight synthetic polymers\n(\ne.g., polyethylene, high density polyethylene [HDPE], polypropylene, polystyrene, polyurethane, polyacrylate, polynorborene, polyisobutylene, ground synthetic rubber, cross-linked allylstyrene and\ntertiary butyl copolymers). This does not include polymers derived from\nbiological material or polymers specifically designed to be degradable; or\n(c) mixtures of these\nnonbiodegradable materials. (ii)\n\nTests for nonbiodegradable sorbents. (a) The sorbent material is determined to be\nnonbiodegradable under ASTM Method G21-70 (1984a)-Standard Practice for\n\nDetermining Resistance of Synthetic Polymer Materials to Fungi (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle); (b) the sorbent material is\ndetermined to be nonbiodegradable under ASTM Method G22-76 (1984b)-Standard\n\nPractice for Determining Resistance of Plastics to Bacteria (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle); or\n(c) the sorbent material\nis determined to be nonbiodegradable under OECD test 301B: (CO\n2\n\nEvolution [Modified Sturm Test]) as incorporated by\nreference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (h) Special requirements for\ncontainers. Unless they are very small, such as an ampule, containers\nmust be either: (1)\nat least 90 percent\nfull when placed in the landfill; or\n(2)\ncrushed, shredded, or similarly reduced\nin volume to the maximum practical extent before burial in the\nlandfill. (i) Disposal of small containers of hazardous waste in overpacked drums (lab\npacks). Small containers of hazardous waste in overpacked drums\n(lab packs) may be placed in a landfill if the following requirements are\nmet: (1)\n\nHazardous waste must be\npackaged in nonleaking inside containers. The inside containers must be of a\ndesign and constructed of a material that will not react dangerously with, be\ndecomposed by or be ignited by, the contained waste. Inside containers must be\ntightly and securely sealed. The inside containers must be of the size and type\nspecified in the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) hazardous\nmaterials regulations (49 CFR parts\n173, 178\nand\n179\n) (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle), if those regulations specify a particular inside container for the\nwaste. (2)\n\nThe inside containers\nmust be overpacked in an open-head Federal DOT specification metal shipping\ncontainer (49 CFR parts\n178\nand\n179\n) (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) of no more than 416-liter (110-gallon) capacity and surrounded by, at a\nminimum, a sufficient quantity of sorbent material, determined to be\nnonbiodegradable in accordance with paragraph (g)(4) of this section to\ncompletely sorb all of the liquid contents of the inside containers. The metal\nouter container must be full after it has been packed with inside containers\nand sorbent material. (3)\n\nThe\nsorbent material used must not be capable of reacting dangerously with, being\ndecomposed by or being ignited by, the contents of the inside containers in\naccordance with section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. (4)\n\nIncompatible\nwastes, as defined in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle, must not be placed in the same outside container. (5)\n\nReactive wastes, other than cyanide- or\nsulfide-bearing waste as defined in section\n371.3\n(d)(1)(v)\nof\nthis Title, must be treated or rendered nonreactive prior to packaging in\naccordance with paragraphs (1) through (4) of this subdivision. Cyanide- and\nsulfide-bearing reactive waste may be packed in accordance with paragraphs (1)\nthrough (4) of this subdivision without first being treated or rendered\nnonreactive. (6)\n\nSuch disposal is\nin compliance with the requirements of Part 376 of this Title. (i) Persons who incinerate lab packs\naccording to the requirements in section\n376.4\n(c)(3)(i)\nof\nthis Title may use fiber drums in place of metal outer containers. Such fiber\ndrums must meet all DOT specifications and be overpacked according to the\nrequirements in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (j) Design and operating\nrequirements. (1)\n\nThe owner or\noperator of each new landfill unit, each lateral expansion of a landfill unit, and each replacement of an existing landfill unit must install two or more\nliners and a leachate collection and removal system above and between the\nliners, and operate the leachate collection and removal systems, in accordance\nwith section\n373-2.14\n(c)(3)\nof\nthis Part, unless excempted under section\n373-2.14\n(c)(4), (5), or (6), of this Part. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator of each unit\nreferred to in paragraph (1) of this subdivision must notify the commissioner\nat least 60 days before receiving waste. The owner or operator of each facility\nsubmitting notice must file a Part 373 permit aplication within six months of\nthe commissioner's receipt of the notice. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator of any replacement\nlandfill unit is exempt from paragraph (1) of this subdivision if: (i) the existing unit was constructed in\ncompliance with the design standards of section 3004(o)(1)(A)(i) and (o)(5) of\nthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle); and\n(ii)\nthere is no reason\nto believe that the liner is not functioning as designed. (4)\n\nThe double liner requirement set forth in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision may be waived by the commissioner for any\nmonofill, if: (i) the monofill contains only\nhazardous wastes from foundary furnace emission controls or metal casting\nmolding sand, and the wastes do not contain constituents which would render the\nwastes hazardous for reasons other than the toxicity characteristic in section\n371.3\n(e) of this\n\nTitle with EPA hazardous waste numbers D004 through D017; and\n(ii)\n(a) (1)\nthe monofill has at least one liner for\nwhich there is no evidence that such a liner is leaking; (2)\nthe monofill is located more than\none-quarter mile from an\nunderground source of drinking water\n(as that term is defined in section\n370.2\n[b]\nof this\n\nTitle); and\n(3)\nthe monofill is in\ncompliance with generally applicable ground-water monitoring requirements for\nfacilities with Part 373 permits; or\n(b) the owner or operator demonstrates that\nthe monofill is located, designed and operated so as to assure that there will\nbe no migration of any hazardous constituent into ground water or surface water\nat any future time. (5)\n\nIn the case of any unit in which the\nliners and leachate collection system have been installed pursuant to the\nrequirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the commissioner, when\nissuing the first permit, will not require that a new liner and leachate\ncollection system be installed, unless the commissioner has reason to believe\nthe liner is leaking. (6)\n\nThe owner\nor operator must design, construct, operate, and maintain a run-on control\nsystem capable of preventing flow onto the active portion of the landfill\nduring peak discharge from at least a 25-year storm. (7)\n\nThe owner or operator must design, construct, operate, and maintain a run-off management system to collect and\ncontrol at least the water volume resulting from a 24-hour, 25-year\nstorm. (8)\n\nCollection and holding\nfacilities (\ne.g., tanks or basins) associated with run-on and\nrun- off control systems must be emptied or otherwise managed expeditiously\nafter storms to maintain design capacity of the system. (9)\n\nThe owner or operator of a landfill\ncontaining hazardous waste which is subject to wind dispersal must cover or\notherwise manage the landfills so that wind dispersal of the hazardous waste is\ncontrolled. Note: As required by section\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart, the waste analysis plan must include analyses needed to comply with\nsubdivisions (e), (f) and (g) of this section. As required by section\n373-3.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, the owner or operator must place the results of these analyses in the\noperating record of the facility. (k) Response actions. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of landfill units\nsubject to paragraph (j)(1) of this section must develop and keep on-site, until a closure of the facility, a response action plan. The response action\nplan must set forth the actions to be taken if the action leakage rate has been\nexceeded. At a minimum, the response action plan must describe the action\nspecified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nIf the flow rate into the leak detection\nsystem exceeds the action leakage rate for any sump, the owner or operator\nmust: (i) notify the department in writing of\nthe exceedance within seven days of the determination; (ii)\nsubmit a preliminary written assessment\nto the commissioner within 14 days of the determination, as to the amount of\nliquids, likely sources of liquids, possible location, size, and cause of any\nleaks, and short-term actions taken and planned; (iii)\ndetermine to the extent practicable the\nlocation, size, and cause of any leak; (iv)\ndetermine whether waste receipt should\ncease or be currtailed, whether any waste should be removed from the unit for\ninspection, repairs, or controls, and whether or not the unit should be\nclosed; (v) determine any other\nshort-term and longer-term actions to be taken to mitigate or stop any leaks; and\n(vi)\nwithin 30 days after the\nnotification that the action leakage rate has been exceeded, submit to the\ncommissioner the results of the analyses specified in subparagraph (ii)-(v) of\nthis paragraph, the results of actions taken, and actions planned. Monthly\nthereafter, as long as the flow rate in the leak detection system exceeds the\naction leakage rate, the owner or operator must submit to the commissioner a\nreport summarizing the results of any remedial action taken and actions\nplanned. (3)\n\nTo make the\nleak and/or remediation determinations in subparagraphs (iii)-(v) of this\nparagraph, the owner or operator must: (i) (a) assess the source of liquids and amounts\nof liquids by source; (b) conduct a\nfingerprint, hazardous constituent, or other analyses of the liquids in the\nleak detection system to identify the source of liquids and possible location\nof any leaks, and the hazard and mobility of the liquid; and\n(c) assess the seriousness of any leaks in\nterms of potential for escaping into the environment; or\n(ii)\ndocument why such assessments are not\nneeded. (l) Monitoring and inspection. (1)\n\nAn owner or operator required to have a leak detection system under paragraph\n(j)(1) of this section must record the amount of liquids removed from each leak\ndetection system sump at least once each week during the active life and\nclosure period. (2)\n\nAfter the final\ncover is installed, the amount of liquid removed from each leak detection\nsystem sump must be recorded at least monthly. If the liquid level in any sump\nstays below its pump operating level for two consecutive months, the amount of\nliquid in the sump must be recorded at least quarterly. If the liquid level in\nthe sump stays below its pump operating level for at least two consecutive\nquarters, the amount of liquid in the sump must be recorded at least\nsemi-annually. If at any time during the post-closure care period the pump\noperating level is exceeded at units on quarterly or semi-annual recording\nschedules, the owner or operator must return to monthly recording of the amount\nof liquid removed from each sump until the liquid level again stays below the\npump operating level for two consecutive months. (3)\n\nPump operating level is a liquid level\nproposed by the owner or operator and approved by the commissioner based on\npump activation level, sump dimensions, and level that avoids backup into the\ndrainage layer and minimizes head in the sump. The timing for submission and\napproval of the proposed pump operating level will be in accordance with\nparagraph (b)(1) of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
