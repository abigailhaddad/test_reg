Tit. 16 § 255.313 - Bends and elbows\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each field\nbend in steel pipe must comply with the following criteria: (1)\nA bend must not impair the serviceability\nof the pipe. (2)\n\nEach bend must\nhave a smooth contour and be free from buckling, cracks, or any other\nmechanical damage. (b) On pipe containing a longitudinal weld, the longitudinal weld must be as near\nas practicable to the neutral axis of the bend unless: (1)\nthe bend is made with an internal bending\nmandrel; or\n(2)\nthe pipe is 12\ninches (305 millimeters) or less in outside diameter or has a diameter to wall\nthickness ratio less than 70. (c) Each circumferential weld of steel pipe\nwhich is located where the stress during bending causes a permanent deformation\nin the pipe must be nondestructively tested after the bending\nprocess. (d) Wrought-steel welding\nelbows and transverse segments of these elbows may not be used for changes in\ndirection on steel pipe that is two inches (51 millimeters) or more in diameter\nunless the arc length, as measured along the crotch, is at least one inch (25\nmillimeters). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.313\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
