  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 38.23 - Vacating installations and property\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Installations. Each licensee, at least 30\ndays prior to terminating any license, vacating any installation, or\ntransferring the premises containing such installation, shall permanently\ndecontaminate such installation and premises below or equal to the limits\nspecified in Table 5 of section\n38.41\nof this Part (rule). A\nsurvey shall be made after such decontamination and submitted to the\ncommissioner. No such installation or premises shall be vacated, sold or\ntransferred until the decontamination survey has been accepted by the\ncommissioner as demonstrating that the residual radioactive contamination of\nthe installation and premises is as low as is reasonably achievable. (b) Property. No machinery, instrument, laboratory equipment or any other property used in contact with or in close\nproximity to radioactive material in a licensed installation shall be assigned, sold, leased or transferred to an unlicensed person unless such property has\nbeen permanently decontaminated below or equal to the limits specified in Table\n5 of section\n38.41\nof this Part (rule). A\nsurvey shall be made after such decontamination and submitted to the\ncommissioner. No such property shall be assigned, sold, leased or transferred\nuntil such survey has been accepted by the commissioner as demonstrating that\nthe residual radioactive contamination of the property is as low as is\nreasonably achievable. (c) Plans\nfor completion of decommissioning. (1)\n\nIn\naddition to the requirements of subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section, the\nlicensee shall submit a plan for completion of decommissioning if the\nprocedures necessary to carry out decommissioning have not been previously\napproved by the commissioner and could increase potential health and safety\nimpacts to workers or to the public such as in any of the following cases: (i) procedures would involve techniques not\napplied routinely by the licensee during past cleanup or maintenance\noperations; (ii)\nworkers would be\nentering areas not normally occupied where surface contamination and radiation\nlevels are significantly higher than routinely encountered during\noperation; (iii)\nprocedures could\nresult in significantly greater airborne concentrations of radioactive\nmaterials than are present during operation; or\n(iv)\nprocedures could result in significantly\ngreater releases of radioactive material to the environment than those\nassociated with operation. (2)\n\nProcedures with potential health and\nsafety impacts may not be carried out prior to approval of the decommissioning\nplan. (3)\n\nThe proposed\ndecommissioning plan, if required by paragraph (1) of this subdivision or by\nlicense condition, must include: (i) a\ndescription of planned decommissioning activities; (ii)\na description of methods used to assure\nprotection of workers and the environment against radiation hazards during\ndecommissioning; (iii)\na\ndescription of the planned final radiation survey; and\n(iv)\nan updated detailed cost estimate for\ndecommissioning, a comparison of that estimate with present funds set aside for\ndecommissioning, and a plan for assuring the availability of adequate funds for\ncompletion of decommissioning. (4)\n\nThe proposed decommissioning plan will be\napproved by the commissioner if the information therein demonstrates that the\ndecommissioning will be completed as soon as is reasonable and that the health\nand safety of workers and the public will be adequately protected. (5)\n\nUpon approval of the decommissioning plan\nby the commissioner, the licensee shall complete decommissioning in accordance\nwith the approved plan. As a final step in decommissioning, the licensee shall\nagain submit the information required in subdivision (a) of this section and\nshall certify the disposition of accumulated wastes from\ndecommissioning. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n38.23\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
