  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 709.4 - End stage renal dialysis service\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This\nmethodology will be utilized in the evaluation of certificate of need\napplications involving the construction or establishment of new or replacement\ndialysis stations used in the treatment of end stage renal disease. It is the\nintent of the State Hospital Review and Planning Council that this methodology, when used in conjunction with the planning standards and criteria set forth in\nsection\n709.1\nof this Part, become a\nstatement of basic principles and planning/decisionmaking tools for guiding and\ndirecting the development of dialysis stations for end stage renal disease\nservices throughout the State. Additionally, it is intended that the\nmethodology will provide the health systems agencies and potential applicants\nwith sufficient flexibility to consider the unique characteristics of their\nrespective areas in determining need. The goals and objectives of the\nmethodology expressed herein are expected to ensure that an adequate supply of\ndialysis stations are available to provide access to care to all those in need\nof in-facility dialysis. (b) The\nfactors to be considered in determining the public need for dialysis stations\nshall include, but not be limited to, the following: (1)\nevidence that the proposed dialysis\nservices capacity proposed will be utilized sufficiently to be financially\nfeasible as demonstrated by a five-year analysis of projected costs and\nrevenues associated with the program; (2)\nevidence that the proposed service or\nadditional capacity will enhance access to services by patients including\nmembers of medically underserved groups which have traditionally experienced\ndifficulties in obtaining equal access to health services (for example, low-\nincome persons, racial and ethnic minorities, women, and handicapped persons), and/or appropriate rural populations; (3)\nevidence that the facility's hours of\noperation and admission policies will promote the availability of services\nwhich are acceptable to those in need of such services, in particular, operational hours that permit individuals in dialysis to continue\nemployment; (4)\nthe facility's\nwillingness and ability safely to serve dialysis patients; and\n(5)\nwhen an existing provider proposes to add\n12 or more stations, evidence, derived from analysis of factors including but\nnot necessarily limited to both existing patient referral and use patterns and\nprojected referral and use patterns which would result from addition of the\nproposed stations, indicating that approval of such stations will not\njeopardize the quality of service provided at or the financial viability of\nother existing dialysis facilities or services within the applicant's planning\narea. However, a finding that the proposed facility would jeopardize the\nfinancial viability of such existing facilities will not, of itself, require a\nrecommendation of disapproval of the application. (c) Public need for a proposed facility or\nstation shall be deemed to exist when review and consideration of evidence\nconcerning each of the five factors set forth in subdivision (b) of this\nsection results in an affirmative finding. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n709.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
