Tit. 9 § 6217.6 - Voter identification verification\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The county board shall promptly, and in\nany event, not later than 21 days after receipt by it of the voter registration\napplication, verify the identity of the applicant who has not previously had\nhis or her identification verified. The voter's registration and enrollment\nshall be complete upon receipt of the application by the appropriate county\nboard. The failure of a county board to verify an applicant's identity shall\nnot be the basis for the rejection of a voter's application; provided, however, that such verification failure shall be the basis for requiring county board to\ntake the additional verification steps provided by the Election Law, section\n5-210 and this Part. (b) In order\nto do so, the county board shall utilize the information provided on the\napplication and shall attempt to verify such information through NYSVoter with\nthe information provided by the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles, or\nthe United States Social Security Administration and any other lawfully\navailable information source. The county board shall do so by transmitting such\ninformation to NYSVoter. The county board shall deem as verified for the\npurposes of this section an application received from the Department of Motor\n\nVehicles processed simultaneously and integrated with an application for a\nmotor vehicle driver's license, a driver's license renewal or an identification\ncard if such card is issued by the Department of Motor Vehicles in its normal\ncourse of business, pursuant to section\n5-212\nof the\n\nElection Law.

The New York State Department of Motor\n\nVehicles shall report back to NYSVoter. Based upon this report, the County\n\nBoard shall determine if they have sufficient information to verify the voter's\nidentity, or whether additional information is required to verify the voter's\nidentity. (d) If necessary to\nverify a voter's identity, NYSVoter shall compare the last four digits of the\nvoter's social security number, name and date of birth, through the New York\n\nState Department of Motor Vehicles with the United States Social Security\n\nAdministration records for verification of the voter's identification as\nrequired by statute.

Based upon this report, the county board shall determine if they have\nsufficient information to verify the voter's identity, or whether additional\ninformation is required to verify the voter's identity. (e) If the county board is unable to verify\nthe identity of the applicant within 21 days of the receipt of the application, it shall immediately take steps to confirm that the information provided by the\napplicant was accurately utilized by such county board, was accurately verified\nwith other information sources and that no data entry error, or other similar\ntype of error, occurred.

(i) If the Board of\n\nElections has been unable to verify the identity of the applicant within 45\ndays of the application, the board shall mail a second request for more\ninformation to the applicant. This notice shall inform the voter that \"THE\nFAILURE TO CONTACT THE BOARD OF ELECTIONS AND CORRECT ANY INACCURACIES IN THE\nAPPLICATION OR PROVIDE REQUESTED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION MAY RESULT IN A REQUEST\nFOR IDENTIFICATION AT THE POLLS IN ORDER TO CAST A VOTE ON A VOTING\nMACHINE.\"\n(j) If the county board\nis unable to verify the identity of the applicant it shall so indicate with a\nnotation next to the voter's name on the registration list.
