  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.19 - Pressure and temperature gages\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each boiler shall have a pressure gage so\nlocated that it is easily readable. The pressure gage shall be installed so\nthat it shall at all times indicate the pressure in the boiler. Each steam\nboiler shall have the pressure gage connected to the steam space or to the\nwater column or its steam connection. The steam gage shall be connected to a\nsiphon or equivalent device of sufficient capacity to keep the gage tube filled\nwith water and so arranged that the gage cannot be shut off from the boiler\nexcept by a cock placed near the gage and provided with a tee or lever handle\narranged to be parallel to the pipe in which it is located when the cock is\nopen. For boilers carrying 500 pounds pressure or over, valves may be used in\nplace of cocks. Steam gage connections which are filled with water or steam\nshall be suitable for the maximum allowable working pressure and steam\ntemperature but if the temperature exceeds 406° Fahrenheit, brass or copper\npipe or tubing shall not be used. The connections to the boiler, except the\nsyphon, shall not be less than one-quarter inch standard pipe size but where\nsteel or wrought-iron pipe or tubing is used, they shall be not less than\none-half inch inside diameter. That portion of the connection used as a syphon\nnext to the steam gage shall be not less than one-quarter inch inside\ndiameter. (b) The wall thickness of\nall pipe connections shall comply at least with the requirements of the ASME\nCode. (c) Where the use of a pipe\nlonger than 10 feet becomes necessary, an exception may be made to the rule\nthat the gage must be arranged so that it cannot be shut off except by a cock\nplaced near the gage, and a shutoff valve or cock arranged so that it can be\nlocked or sealed open may be used near the boiler. Such a pipe shall be of\nample size and arranged so that it may be cleared by blowing out. (d) Each forced-flow steam generator with no\nfixed steam and waterline shall be equipped with pressure gages or other\npressure measuring devices located as follows: (1)\nat the boiler or superheater outlet\n(following the last section which involves absorption of heat); (2)\nat the boiler or economizer inlet\n(preceding any section which involves absorption of heat); and\n(3)\nupstream of any shutoff valve which may\nbe used between any two sections of the heat absorbing surface. (e) Each high-temperature water\nboiler shall have a temperature gage so located and connected that it shall be\neasily readable. The temperature gage shall be installed so that it at all\ntimes indicates the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit of the water in the\nboiler, at or near the outlet connection. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.19\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
