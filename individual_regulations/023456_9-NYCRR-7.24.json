Tit. 9 § 7.24 - Executive Order No. 24: Establishing a Goal to Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions Eighty Percent by the Year 2050 and Preparing a Climate Action Plan\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, an emerging scientific consensus recognizes that\nthe increased concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, along with\nother heat-trapping greenhouse gases, resulting from the combustion of fossil\nfuels and other human sources, warms the planet and changes its climate; and\nWHEREAS, many scientists warn that unmitigated climate\nchange is expected to result in significant adverse impacts to our communities, economy and environment; and\nWHEREAS, according to the scientific assessments of the\n\nUnited Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and other work, substantial reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by mid-century have the\npotential to minimize the most severe climate change impacts currently\npredicted; and\nWHEREAS, the reduction of global warming and limitation of\nclimate change effects requires a collaborative, international effort to reduce\nthe emission of greenhouse gases around the globe; and\nWHEREAS, New York and other states should work\ncollaboratively with the federal government to develop and implement plans and\npolicies that will achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the United\n\nStates; and\nWHEREAS, expanding and advancing energy efficiency and\nrenewable energy projects will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create new\njobs; and\nWHEREAS, New York State has demonstrated leadership in this\neffort by undertaking actions such as: * Executive Order No. 2 (2008): Establishing a State Energy\n\nPlanning Board and Authorizing the Creation and Implementation of a State\n\nEnergy Plan; * Executive Order No. 4 (2008): Establishing a State Green\n\nProcurement and Agency Sustainability Program; * Creation of the Governor's Smart Growth Cabinet; * Adoption of goals and practices for energy efficiency and\ngreen building technology in State buildings, and for the use of biofuels in\n\nState vehicles and buildings; * Creation of the New York State Office of Climate Change\nin the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation; * Participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a ten-state cooperative effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from electric\npower plants by means of a cap and trade system; * Creation of an Energy Efficiency Portfolio Standard, which is intended to reduce the State's electricity consumption by 15 percent\nbelow projected levels by 2015, complementing the State's System Benefit Charge\nand Renewable Portfolio Standard; * The formation of a Renewable Energy Task Force and a Sea\n\nLevel Rise Task Force; * Collaboration with other northeastern and mid-Atlantic\nstates on the development of a regional low carbon fuel standard; * Establishment of a 45 x 15 Initiative, which set a goal\nto meet 45% of New York's electricity needs through improved energy efficiency\nand clean renewable energy by 2015; * Adoption of regulations establishing greenhouse gas\nexhaust emission standards for motor vehicles; * Enactment of legislation requiring new motor vehicles to\nbear labels disclosing information to consumers about vehicle greenhouse gas\nemissions; * Enactment of legislation establishing \"green\" residential\nand State building programs; * Enactment of legislation expanding the State's \"net\nmetering\" laws, allowing increased development of renewable energy by\nelectricity customers; * Enactment of legislation expanding energy efficiency and\nclean energy initiatives of the New York Power Authority to public entities; and\n* Investment of billions of dollars by the New York State\n\nEnergy Research and Development Authority, the New York Power Authority and the\n\nLong Island Power Authority in existing, expanded and new energy efficiency and\nrenewable energy programs; and\nWHEREAS, it is appropriate to build upon the important\nenvironmental benefits obtained through these actions and to establish a\n\nState-wide goal for the reduction of greenhouse gases, and to develop a plan\nthat enables New York to participate fully in the national and international\nefforts to combat climate change. NOW, THEREFORE, I, David A. Paterson, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\n\nLaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: 1. It shall be a goal of the State of New\n\nYork to reduce current greenhouse gas emissions from all sources within the\n\nState eighty percent (80%) below levels emitted in the year nineteen hundred\nninety (1990) by the year two-thousand fifty (2050). 2. There is hereby created a Climate Action\n\nCouncil (\"Council\") consisting of the Commissioners of Agriculture and Markets, Economic Development, Environmental Conservation, Housing and Community\n\nRenewal, and Transportation; the Chairs of the Public Service Commission, and\n\nMetropolitan Transportation Authority; the Presidents of the New York State\n\nEnergy Research and Development Authority, Long Island Power Authority, New\n\nYork Power Authority and Dormitory Authority of the State of New York; the\n\nSecretary of State; the Director of the Budget; the Director of State\n\nOperations; and the Counsel to the Governor. The Director of State Operations\nshall serve as the Chair of the Council. 3. The Council shall prepare a draft Climate\n\nAction Plan on or before September 30, 2010. The Council shall hold regional\npublic comment hearings on the draft Plan, and shall allow at least 60 days for\nthe submission of public comment. Thereafter, the Council shall prepare a final\n\nClimate Action Plan which shall be reviewed and, if warranted, adjusted\nannually by the Council. 4. In\naspiring to meet the greenhouse gas emission reduction goal, the Council, in\npreparing the Climate Action Plan, shall: a. inventory greenhouse gas emissions within the State, including the relative\ncontribution of each type of emission source; b. identify and assess short-term and\nlong-term actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate\nchange across all economic sectors, including industry, transportation, agriculture, building construction and energy production; c. identify and analyze the anticipated\nreductions, and the economic implications thereof, as a result of each\naction; d. identify the anticipated\nlife-cycle implications, consequences, benefits and costs of implementing each\naction, including implications, consequences, benefits and costs to the State, local governments, business and residents from implementation of each option\nand action; e. identify whether\nsuch actions support New York's goals for clean energy in the new economy, including specific short-term and long-term economic development opportunities\nand disadvantages related to greenhouse gas emission reductions and the\ndevelopment and deployment of new and emerging technologies and energy\nsources; f. coordinate its\nactivities with the State energy planning process of the State Energy Planning\n\nBoard; g. identify existing legal, regulatory and policy constraints to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, assessing the impacts of climate change, and adapting to climate change, and\nrecommend ways to address any such constraints; h. establish estimated timelines for\nconsidering and implementing actions; and\ni. undertake such actions, and compile such\nadditional material, as deemed appropriate by the Council in carrying out its\nresponsibilities under this Order. 5.

The Council may convene advisory panels to\nassist or advise it in areas requiring special expertise or\nknowledge. 8. The Climate Action\n\nPlan is not intended to be static, but rather a dynamic and continually\nevolving strategy to assess and achieve the goal of sustained reductions of\ngreenhouse gas emissions.
