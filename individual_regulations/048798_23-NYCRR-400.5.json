In the event the prior participating provider agreement\nbetween the health care plan and the non-participating hospital expired more\nthan 12 months prior to the payment of the disputed claim, the payment amount\nshall be adjusted based upon the annual medical consumer price index, compounded for each year subsequent to the year the contract terminated up\nuntil the year the claim is paid. If a health care plan believes that this\ninitial payment amount to a non-participating hospital with which it had\npreviously entered into a participating provider agreement is not reasonable, it may submit a dispute to the superintendent for review by an IDRE, as\nprovided in section\n400.7\nof this Part, and propose an\namount it deems reasonable, provided that the health care plan: (a) notifies the non-participating hospital\nof its intent to submit the dispute to the superintendent, together with the\nhealth care plan's best and final offer and an explanation of the calculation, including the aggregation or any other methodology used by the health care plan\nto develop its best and final offer; (b) provides the non-participating hospital\nwith 15 business days to respond to the health care plan with the\nnon-participating hospital's best and final offer before submitting the dispute\nto the superintendent; (c) includes\nits best and final offer and the non-participating hospital's best and final\noffer, if any, in its submission of the dispute to the superintendent; and\n(d) notifies the\nnon-participating hospital of the dispute at the time of the submission to the\nsuperintendent; and\n(iii)\nnot be precluded from attempting to\nnegotiate the reimbursement amount with the non-participating physician or\nnon-participating hospital within the timeframes established in Insurance Law\nsection 3224-a; (2)\nif\nthe claim is submitted by the non-participating physician or non-participating\nhospital, or if payment is made to the non-participating physician or\nnon-participating hospital, provide notice to the non-participating physician\nor non-participating hospital describing how to initiate the independent\ndispute resolution process; (3)\nif\nthe health care plan pays an amount less than the non-participating physician's\nor non-participating hospital's charge, provide the insured with notice, included on or in conjunction with, an explanation of benefits, which shall: (i) explain that the insured shall incur no\ngreater out-of-pocket costs for the services than the insured would have\nincurred with a participating physician or participating hospital; (ii)\nexplain that the insured's cost-sharing\nmay increase in the event the IDRE determines that the health care plan must\npay additional amounts for the services of the non-participating physician or\nnonparticipating hospital; and\n(iii)\ndirect the insured to contact the\nhealth care plan in the event that the non-participating physician or\nnon-participating hospital bills the insured for the out-of-network service\nother than the insured's in-network copayment, coinsurance, or deductible; and\n(4)\npay the amount\nset forth in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision\ndirectly to the non-participating physician or non-participating hospital if an\ninsured assigns benefits to the non-participating physician or\nnon-participating hospital.

If the health care plan's\nattempts to negotiate reimbursement for the health care services provided by\nthe non-participating physician or non-participating referred health care\nprovider do not result in a resolution of the payment dispute, the health care\nplan shall pay the non-participating physician or non-participating referred\nhealth care provider an amount the health care plan determines is reasonable\nfor the health care services rendered, except for the insured's copayment, coinsurance or deductible, in accordance with the timeframes established in\n\nInsurance Law section 3224-a.
