  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.86 - Executive Order No. 86: Targeting the location of State facilities in downtown areas\n\nState Regulations\nI, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of New York, by\nvirtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the Laws of the\n\nState of New York, do hereby issue this Executive Order to solidify the State's\ncommitment to help local governments promote the redevelopment of downtown\nareas by targeting the location of State facilities in downtown areas, including the leasing of space for State use, and by examining the potential\nfor the conversion of surplus properties to private use. Over the past two decades, municipalities of New York State\nhave experienced a decline in their central business districts and downtown\nareas. Nevertheless, urban areas remain important generators of employment and\ncenters of economic and cultural activity. They contain sizeable public\ninvestments and house major storehouses, producers and consumers of goods. In a\ntime of dwindling resources, they are efficient conservers of energy. The State must use its resources, in cooperation with local\ngovernments and the private sector, to promote the redevelopment of downtown\nareas. The location of State facilities in downtown areas, including the\nleasing of space for State use, can complement these redevelopment efforts. In\naddition, nonutilized or underutilized State facilities, available for\nconversion to private use, offer a potentially significant incentive to attract\nprivate sector investment in urban areas. To ensure this State policy is properly coordinated and\nimplemented, I hereby direct: - the Director of the Division of the Budget and the\n\nCommissioner of General Services to carry out an intensified effort to locate\nand use State facilities in downtown areas, including the leasing of space for\n\nState use, and to explore the conversion of surplus properties to private\nuse; - the heads of State departments and agencies to assign\npriority to the rehabilitation of State facilities and the development of new\nfacilities in downtown areas; - the heads of State departments and agencies, in\ncooperation with the Commissioner of General Services, to assign priority to\nthe leasing of space in downtown areas, when additional space is required to\nconduct State business. In this regard, State agencies and departments shall\nreview and modify their procedures for requesting leasing assistance from the\n\nOffice of General Services to include a written report detailing the extent to\nwhich consideration was given to downtown locations, when additional office\nspace is necessary; and\n- the Commissioner of General Services, using the directory\nof \"State-Owned Real Property Available for Economic Development,\" to cooperate\nwith State development agencies to offer surplus State properties for\nconversion to private use. The Urban Affairs Cabinet will monitor the implementation\nof this Executive Order and report to the Governor from time to time as\nnecessary. Signed: Hugh L. Carey\n\nDated: March 22, 1979\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n3.86\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
