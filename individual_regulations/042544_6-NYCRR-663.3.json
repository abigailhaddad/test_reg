  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 663.3 - Applicability of this part\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This\n\nPart provides the framework for the department's administration of the\nfreshwater wetlands regulatory protection program in those areas of the State\nwhere the commissioner has promulgated an official map and the department, rather than a local government, is the regulating authority. (b) Permit applications must be filed with\nand processed by the local government, in accordance with local laws and\nregulations, for those areas of the State where the commissioner has\npromulgated an official map and a local government has assumed the freshwater\nwetlands regulating authority pursuant to section 24-0501 of the act and Part\n665 of this Title. (c) Permit\napplications must be filed with the department and processed in accordance with\nthe department's Freshwater Wetlands Interim Permits regulations (Part 662), for those areas of the State where the commissioner has not promulgated an\nofficial map. (d) Permit\napplications must be filed with and processed by the department in accordance\nwith this Part for those areas of the State where the commissioner has\npromulgated an official map, and: (1)\na local\ngovernment has not assumed regulatory authority pursuant to section 24-0501 of\nthe act and Part 665 of this Title; or\n(2)\na county has transferred regulatory\nauthority to the department pursuant to section 24-0503 of the act and Part\n665; or\n(3)\nthe commissioner has\nsuperseded local authority and retained jurisdiction pursuant to section\n24-0503 of the act and Part 665. (e) All persons proposing to conduct\nactivities on wetlands or adjacent areas that have not been specifically\nexempted from regulation under section 24-0701 of the act or section\n662.2\n(z) of this\n\nPart must obtain either a permit or a letter of permission. (f) Where a local government or other\npolitical subdivision of the State is the applicant for a permit pursuant to\nthe act, the department shall serve as the regulatory authority. A local\ngovernment may not process its own application or that of another local\ngovernment or political subdivision of the State. (g) Where a regulated wetland lies within two\nor more jurisdictions, whether that be two or more local governments or the\ndepartment and local government(s): (1)\nthe\nagency receiving the permit application must immediately provide copies to the\nother entities sharing jurisdiction; and\n(2)\nthe agency within whose jurisdiction the\nproposed activity will occur will process the application in consultation with\nthe other entities in an effort to achieve a mutually satisfactory decision. However, the final decision will rest with the agency having jurisdiction over\nthe permit application. (h) Where a local government is the\nregulatory authority for a wetland and its adjacent area associated with a\nmajor international or interstate river or lake, it must consult with the\ndepartment before taking any regulatory action pursuant to the act concerning\nthat wetland or its adjacent area. Those rivers and lakes are the Hudson, Delaware, Susquehanna, Niagara and St. Lawrence rivers and Lakes Erie, Ontario\nand Champlain and are considered to extend in tributaries to the first barrier\nimpassable to fish or the first bridge, whichever is further downstream. A\nwetland is associated with such a river or lake when it is contiguous to the\nbody of water or, if separated, the separation is only a narrow strip of land, such as a barrier beach or railroad bed. (i) A local government, upon the\nimplementation of a local freshwater wetlands protection program pursuant to\ntitle 5 of the act and Part 665 of this Title, becomes the regulatory authority\nfor all freshwater wetlands wholly or partially within its jurisdiction, except\nfor wetlands and their adjacent areas exempted from local implementation in\naccordance with section 24-0505 of the act. These wetlands will be shown on the\nofficial map and will be a Class I wetlands as described in the department's\n\nFreshwater Wetlands Maps and Classification Regulations (Part 664). Permit\napplications for Class I wetlands must be filed with and processed by the\ndepartment. (j) If the department\nreclassifies to Class I a wetland under local jurisdiction, the local\ngovernment retains jurisdiction for any permit application received prior to\nthe reclassification and must apply the Class I standards of section\n665.7\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. Thereafter, the wetland shall be under the jurisdiction of the\ndepartment for subsequent permit applications. (k) Notwithstanding the exemption of Class I\nwetlands from local implementation described in subdivision (i) of this\nsection, the commissioner may delegate to a local government the department's\nregulatory authority for those wetlands, pursuant to section 3-0301.2(p) of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law and Part 665 of this Title. (l) A person who has obtained an interim\npermit from the department pursuant to Part 662 of this Title prior to the date\nan official map is promulgated or a local government assumes regulatory\nauthority is not required to obtain an additional permit, however, a new permit\nmay be necessary under those conditions specified in section\n663.6\nof this Part. If an\napplication for an interim permit has been submitted to the department and a\ndecision has not been made at the time a local government assumes regulatory\nauthority pursuant to Part 665, the department retains regulatory authority\nover that application. The department staff must consult with the local\ngovernment prior to making a decision on the application. (m) This Part is not applicable to wetlands\nor portions of wetlands within the Adirondack Park. Those wetlands or portions\nof wetlands are regulated by the Adirondack Park Agency and Adirondack Park\nlocal governments, pursuant to title 8 of the act. (n) Activities regulated by article VII or\nVIII of the Public Service Law do not require a permit or letter of permission\nunder this Part. However, the standards in section\n663.5\n(e) of this\n\nPart must be applied in determining whether to issue a certificate of\nenvironmental compatibility and public need under those articles. (o) This Part and the act do not apply to\nland uses, improvements or developments for which final approval was obtained\nprior to September 1, 1975, from the local governmental authority or\nauthorities having jurisdiction over such land use. However, expansion or\nsignificant modification of the existing use, or the introduction of any form\nof pollution, including but not limited to sewage effluent, runoff or\npesticides, or disposal of toxic substances into wetlands or adjacent areas are\nregulated activities under this Part. The term final approval is defined in\nsection 24-1305 of the act. Persons wishing to rely on an approval given by the\nlocal government prior to September 1, 1975, should request a decision from the\nregional permit administrator as to whether the approval given meets the\nrequirements of section 24-1305 of the act. To request such a decision, permit\napplicants should write to the regional permit administrator, giving details of\nthe approval relied upon, and enclosing supporting documentation. The burden of\nshowing exemption from the permit requirements of the act rests on the person\nseeking to benefit from the exemption. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
