Subpart 373-3)\nTESTS FOR SIGNIFICANCE\nAs required in section\n373-3.6\n(d)(2), the\nowner or operator must use the Student's t-test to determine statistically\nsignificant changes in the concentration or value of an indicator parameter in\nperiodic ground-water samples when compared to the initial background\nconcentration or value of that indicator parameter. The comparison must\nconsider individually each of the wells in the monitoring system. For three of\nthe indicator parameters (specific conductance, total organic carbon and total\norganic halogen), a single-tailed Student's t-test must be used to test at the\n0.01 level of significance for significant increases over background. The\ndifference test for pH must be a two-tailed Student's t-test at the overall\n0.01 level of significance. The Student's t-test involves a calculation of the value of a\nt-statistic for each comparison of the mean (average) concentration or value\n(based on a minimum of four replicate measurements) of an indicator parameter\nwith its initial background concentrations or value. The calculated value of\nthe t-statistic must then be compared to the value of the t-statistic found in\na table for t-test of significance at the specified level of significance. A\ncalculated value of t which exceeds the value of t found in the table indicates\na statistically significant change in the concentration or value of the\nindicator parameter. Formulae for calculation of the t-statistic and tables for\nt-test of significance can be found in most introductory statistics\ntexts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 6, ch. X, Appendices, app\n28\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
