A brief in support thereof shall be filed\nsimultaneously as a separate document. A copy of such exceptions and briefs\nshall be served upon all other parties and proof of such service shall be filed\nwith the board. (c) The exceptions\nshall: (1)\nset forth specifically the\nquestions or policy to which exceptions are taken; (2)\nidentify that part of the decision, report, order, ruling or other findings or determinations to which exceptions\nare taken; (3)\ndesignate by page\ncitation the portions of the record relied upon; and\n(4)\nstate the grounds for exceptions. An\nexception which is not specifically urged is waived. (d) Within seven working days after receipt\nof exceptions, any party may file electronically (see section\n263.15\nof this Part) a response\nthereto, or crossexceptions, and a brief in support thereof, together with\nproof of service of copies of these documents upon each party to the\nproceeding. Within seven working days after receipt of cross-exceptions, any\nparty may file electronically a response, together with proof of service of a\ncopy thereof upon each party to the proceeding. No pleading other than\nexceptions, cross-exceptions, or a response thereto will be accepted or\nconsidered by the board unless it is requested by the board or filed with the\nboard's authorization. Such additional pleadings will not be requested or\nauthorized by the board unless the preceding pleading properly raises issues\nwhich are material to the disposition of the matter for the first time. If any\nadditional pleading is requested or authorized by the board, the board shall\nnotify the parties regarding the conditions under which that pleading will be\npermitted. (e) A request for an\nextension of time within which to file exceptions and briefs shall be in\nwriting, and filed electronically with the board before the expiration of the\nrequired time for filing exceptions, provided that the time during which to\nrequest an extension of time may be extended because of extraordinary\ncircumstances. A party requesting an extension of time shall notify all parties\nto the proceeding of its request and shall indicate to the board the position\nof each other party with regard to such request. (f) If a party desires to argue orally before\nthe board, a written request with reasons therefor shall accompany the\nexceptions, the response thereto, or the crossexceptions and be prominently\ndisplayed on the first page of the party's papers. The board may grant such a\nrequest; it may also direct oral argument on its own motion. (g) Upon receipt of the case, the board may\nadopt, modify, or reverse the decision, report, order, ruling, finding, or\ndetermination to which exceptions have been filed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
