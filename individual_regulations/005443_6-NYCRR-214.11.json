  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 214.11 - Test procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Coke\npushing and transport, and waste heat (underfire) stack. Stack testing\nprocedures for determining compliance with the standards set forth in sections\n214.4\n(a) and\n214.6\n(a) of this\n\nPart will be conducted in accordance with methods acceptable to the\ncommissioner. The methodology specified in appendix\nA\nof part\n60\nof title 40 of\nthe Code of Federal Regulations (see table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) and all future\ntechnical revisions, additions or corrections made thereto shall be considered\nacceptable, except where the commissioner has required a specific method. If\nthe control device cannot be tested in accordance with those methods, appropriate test methods will be determined by the commissioner in accordance\nwith Part 202 of this Title. During each stack test performed, simultaneous\nvisible emission evaluations must be conducted and a copy of the raw data\nsheets must be included with the test report. The report must include actual\nsampling times to allow a comparison between the visible emissions and the\nstack test results. During each stack test performed, the source owner must\nprovide access to production data and other parameters necessary for\ndetermining compliance. During each run of a stack test, the source to be\ntested will be operated at a production level at least as large as the average\nproduction level during the three months prior to the first day of testing. Unless modified below, compliance will be determined by averaging three runs. Testing will be performed on a sufficient number of pushing and transport\noperation cycles in order to achieve a minimum of a one-hour duration test run. (1)\n\nIf a mobile evacuation and emission\ncontrol system is used, compliance will be determined by the use of a pushing\nemissions test car. The car must be supplied by the source owner in order to\nperform these tests and must contain the necessary duct extension to perform\nthe test. (2)\n\nIf a positive\npressure baghouse control system is used, any grating or other openings of the\nbaghouse compartments which may admit outside air into the baghouse must be\nsealed during the sampling periods. (3)\n\nIf a modular baghouse is used and the\nbaghouse contains more than five stacks, the owner must perform one test run\nper stack. Compliance will be determined by computing the mass emission rate, in pounds per hour, for each stack and then summing each of these mass emission\nrates. During all test runs, the production rate must be maintained within 10\npercent of the mean rate for the entire sampling period. (4)\n\nTo determine compliance with the\npound-per-ton mass emission standard, the measured particulate concentration\nwill be multiplied by the volumetric flow rate at standard conditions (20°\nCentigrade [C], 760 millimeters [mm]), measured at the sampling point, and\ndivided by the number of tons of coal charged to the ovens that were pushed\nduring the test. (5)\n\nPushing\nemission control sheds. (i) The sampling of a\npush will begin with the initial movement of the ram pushing the coke out of\nthe oven. Sampling will end three minutes later unless the ram becomes stuck\nbefore the coke is completely pushed out of the oven. If the ram does become\nstuck in the oven, sampling will be discontinued during the time of no\nsignificant emissions generation and will resume when the ram moves the coke\nagain. The sampling period for that push will end when three minutes of sample\nhave been collected. (ii)\nA\nsufficient number of visible emission observers will be used to observe all\nsources of visible emissions during the mass emission test. (b) Coke oven fuel\ngas-sulfur recovery/desulfurization systems. For the purpose of determining\ncompliance with the coke oven gas standard of 0.5 grains of sulfur compounds\n(measured as hydrogen sulfide) per dry standard cubic foot of total coke oven\ngas produced, or alternative limits approved by the commissioner, the following\ntest procedures must be followed: (1)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must submit a schematic diagram of the coke oven gas main\ndistribution system immediately downstream of the exhausters. This schematic\ndiagram must include gas flow rates in dry standard cubic feet per minute for\nthe sampling points selected to determine the sulfur compound concentrations in\ncoke oven gas used, emitted or flared. Flow rates are not required when\nanalysis indicates the total coke oven gas sulfur concentration prior to\ndesulfurization is below 0.5 grains per dry standard cubic foot of sulfur\ncompounds (measured as hydrogen sulfide). (2)\n\nWhere gas flow rates are required, the\nsource owner must use an orifice flow rate measuring device or equivalent at\nthe time of sampling. (3)\n\nThe\ndesignated sampling points must be accepted and approved in accordance with\n\nPart 202 of this Title. Using the Tutweiller method of analysis, take a minimum\nthree samples, one per hour, at each required sampling point. (4)\n\nThe concentration of sulfur compounds at\neach sampling point is determined by averaging the total of each group of three\nsamples. (5)\n\nCompliance\ndetermination is established by calculating the flow-weighted average of all\nrequired sampling points for the total coke oven gas produced. (c) Wet quench towers. Emission\ntesting must be done in accordance with methods acceptable to the commissioner. The reference methods specified in appendix\nA\nof part 60 of title 40 of the\n\nCode of Federal Regulations (see table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), as modified\nbelow, shall be considered acceptable. The source owner may propose alternative\nmethods in compliance with Part 202 of this Title. (1)\nA cyclone with a cut size of 3 to 10\nmicrometers must be placed ahead of the sampling probe. The volume of the\nliquid removed by the cyclone should be reported in the test report. The liquid\nshould be evaporated at room temperature and the weight of the solid residue\nshould be recorded and included as a part of the front half catch. (2)\n\nThe gas velocity at each sampling point\nin the quench tower must be measured and continuously recorded on a strip chart\nor by means of another equivalent automated system during a normal quench. The\ntwo gas sampling rates will be determined from the recorded relationship of\nstack gas velocity over time. One of these flow rates is the peak observed\nduring the middle of the quench. The other flow rate is normally one half to\ntwo thirds the peak and represents the average flow during the early and late\nstages of the quench when the stack velocity is increasing and decreasing. The\nactual flow rates during stack sampling must be at the lower level for the time\nit takes the stack velocity to reach the peak, at the high rate during the peak\nand at the lower level during the time the flow rate is decreasing from the\npeak. (3)\n\nSampling of an individual\nquench will begin with the entrance of the quench car into the tower and will\nend with the exit of the car from the quench tower. (4)\nA sufficient integral number of quenches\nmust be sampled to collect the same number of samples from each probe location\nand the total sample volume required by the reference methods. (5)\n\nThe sampling probes must be located at\nleast five feet above the baffles and at least five feet below the top of the\ntower. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
