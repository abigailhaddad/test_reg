  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1630-1.1 - Purchase of insurance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ncommissioner requires that authorities shall obtain insurance protection at the\nlowest premium cost consistent with proper safety and full protection, and will\napprove only policies of insurance that measure up to these\nstandards. (b) The cost of\ninsurance has a direct bearing on rent charges and on amount of subsidy\nrequired from State. Accordingly, all possible savings should be effected in\npurchasing insurance for projects. In this connection it is required that bids\nbe obtained from all types of insurance carriers and from various insurance\ncompany groups, in order to determine which offers lowest net cost. Whenever\npossible, a minimum of six quotations of premium cost shall be obtained, three\nfrom stock and three from mutual carriers. Each premium quotation shall be from\na different source. In all cases, only nonassessable insurance carriers will be\nacceptable as meeting requirements of Division of Housing. Each quotation shall\ninclude breakdown of rating data used in computing bid. (c) The authority shall analyze and evaluate\nquotations of cost received in accordance with above subdivision, and forward\nquotations together with their recommendations and analysis, and a summary of\nreplies to invitations to bid, to Division of Housing for review and approval. Written approval by Division of Housing is necessary. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1630-1.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
