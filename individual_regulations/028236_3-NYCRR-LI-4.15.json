  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.15 - Deposits in savings banks by cooperative corporations\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was asked whether a savings bank could accept\nthe deposits of a cooperative corporation, organized under the Cooperative\n\nCorporations Law, in view of section 237.2 of the Banking Law, which provides\nthat a savings bank may not accept deposits from any \"partnership, corporation\nor other organization for profit\". The department replied that section 237.2 has always been\nunderstood to prohibit only deposits of corporations \"for profit\". General\n\nConstruction Law, section 65(c) (3) provides that a cooperative corporation is\na corporation \"formed other than for profit\". Section 66.12 of the General\n\nConstruction Law defines a cooperative corporation as a corporation \"to which\nthe cooperative corporations law is made applicable by a provision of such\nlaw\". Section\n3\n(d) of the Cooperative Corporations Law\nprovides as follows: \"A cooperative corporation shall be classed as a non-profit\ncorporation, since its primary object is not to make profits for itself as\nsuch, or to pay dividends on invested capital, but to provide service and means\nwhereby its members may have the economic advantage of cooperative action, including a reasonable and fair return for their product and service.\"\nIn view of the foregoing statutory definitions, the\ndepartment is of the opinion that a cooperative corporation is not a\ncorporation \"for profit\" whose deposits would be excluded, and therefore a\nsavings bank may accept the deposit of a cooperative corporation. DATED: October 1975\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 4.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
