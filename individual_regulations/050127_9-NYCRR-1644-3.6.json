  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1644-3.6 - Premiums on State housing bonds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) As described in Part 1643, Financing, the premiums, if any, on housing bonds\nsold by the State are paid into the State Housing Debt Fund and do not\nordinarily pass through the project's bank accounts. Premiums on State housing\nbonds, if any, are credited to development costs, whether the bonds are sold\nprior or subsequent to the date of substantial completion. The premium is\nrecorded, by a journal entry, whenever the local agency is notified by the\n\nDivision of Housing as to the amount of the premium allocable to the projects\nparticipating in the bond issue, as follows: Entry (3): Debit: Account 1124, State Housing Debt Fund\n$XXX\nCredit: Account 1420.8, Premium on State Housing Bonds\n$XXX\nExplanation:To record the premium on housing bond issue\nno. ________, as per letter from Division of Housing dated\n________,19________. (b) The premium on State housing bonds will not be amortized over the life of the\nbonds, as is sometimes done, but is, ordinarily, applied by the State\n\nComptroller to the first interest payments falling due. The division will\nnotify the local agency, in advance of the date the local agency is called upon\nto remit the interest for deposit in the State Housing Debt Fund, as to how\nmuch of the premium, if any, the Comptroller intends to apply to the payment of\nthe interest and the local agency will then remit the difference between the\nscheduled payment and the premium applied. The actual amount remitted will be\npaid in the manner previously described (see entry [1], §\n1644-3.5, above) and account 1124, State Housing Debt Fund, is charged. On the date the interest is due to be paid\nto the bondholders, entry (2) above (§\n1644-3.5\n) is made, charging the\nfull scheduled amount of the interest payment, before the deduction for the\npremium applied, to the accrued interest payable account and crediting account\n1124, State Housing Debt Fund. Note that the amount of the quarterly accrual\nfor the interest on the bonds, computed as per section 1644- 3.3, is not\naffected by either the receipt or the application of the premium. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1644-3.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
