  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 102.6 - Financial institutions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Regardless of whether it has executed a direct deposit of salary enrollment\nform, a financial institution's acceptance and handling of a payment issued\npursuant to this Part shall constitute its agreement to the provisions of this\n\nPart. (b) A financial institution\nin executing a direct deposit of salary enrollment form shall be responsible\nfor: (1)\nthe completeness and accuracy of the\ndata entered by it in its portion of the direct deposit of salary enrollment\nform; and\n(2)\nverification of the\nidentity of the recipient and any joint tenant on the account, if applicable, who initiate and execute the direct deposit of salary enrollment form through\nsuch financial institution, and that the account number entered by the\nrecipient on the direct deposit of salary enrollment form corresponds to an\naccount bearing the name of the recipient and if a joint tenant has signed the\nform, that the joint tenant is also named as a depositor on the account. A\nfinancial institution that executes a direct deposit of salary enrollment form\non which the recipient's signature or the joint tenant's signature is forged\nshall be liable to the State under this Part for all payments made on the basis\nof such form. However, if the State fails to take corrective action after it\nhas been notified that a payment has not been received by the correct recipient\ndue to forgery, the State shall be liable for any payments based on the forged\ndirect deposit of salary enrollment form and made after the date of such\nnotice. (c) A financial\ninstitution receiving a payment shall credit the amount of such payment to the\naccount indicated by the account information specified in the payment\ninstructions. If the financial institution is unable to credit the amount of a\npayment to the account indicated by the account information in the payment\ninstruction because such an account does not exist on its books, or because in\nprocessing the payment instruction it has reason to believe the account\nindicated by the account number information in the payment instruction is not\nthe account designated by the recipient, it shall either: (1)\nreturn the payment to the originating\ndepository financial institution with a statement identifying the reason\ntherefor; or\n(2)\ncredit the amount\nof the payment to the account designated by the recipient where the financial\ninstitution is able to positively determine that the account is the account\ndesignated by the recipient on the direct deposit of salary enrollment form. A credit to any other account by a financial institution will\nconstitute a breach of its warranty made by reason of subdivision (i) of this\nsection. (d) A\nfinancial institution shall promptly return to the State through the\noriginating depository financial institution any payment received by such\nfinancial institution: (1)\nafter termination\nof a direct deposit of a salary enrollment form pursuant to section\n102.5\n(e) of this\n\nPart and before the execution of a new direct deposit of salary enrollment\nform. If a payment is received after a new direct deposit of salary enrollment\nform is executed, but before the form is transmitted to the personnel office or\npayroll office of the recipient's agency, the financial institution may credit\nthe payment to the account indicated on the new form and transmit the new form\nto the recipient's agency promptly; (2)\nafter termination of a direct deposit of\nsalary enrollment form pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section has become\neffective; (3)\nafter the death of\nthe recipient. A financial institution may limit its liability if the financial\ninstitution did not have knowledge of the death of the recipient at the time of\nthe deposit or withdrawal of any payments made after the death of the\nrecipient, and the financial institution fulfills the requirements set forth in\nsection\n102.8\nof this Part; or\n(4)\nafter the closing of the recipient's\naccount. (e) A financial\ninstitution to which a payment is sent under this Part does not thereby become\na State depositary and shall not advertise itself as one because of that\nfact. (f) If any change in account\nnumbers is made by a financial institution, the financial institution will be\nresponsible to the recipient for any lost or late payment caused by the\nfinancial institution's actions in processing the change in accordance with\napplicable State and Federal statutes. (g) Each financial institution by its action\nof handling a payment under this Part shall be deemed to warrant to the State\nthat it has handled the payment in accordance with the requirements of this\n\nPart. If the warranty is breached, the financial institution shall indemnify\nthe State for any loss sustained or liability incurred by the State, but only\nto the extent that such loss was the result of the breach. The State will give\nthe financial institution prompt written notice of any claim of loss. This\nprovision does not deny the financial institution the opportunity to cure the\ndefect and to defend, settle or otherwise compromise the claim. (h) At his sole discretion, the State\n\nComptroller may terminate the participation in this program of any financial\ninstitution which the State Comptroller finds to be causing unacceptable\nadministrative difficulties including but not limited to unreasonable delays in\nmaking recurring payments available to recipients. In the event termination is\ncontemplated, the State Comptroller shall send to the financial institution by\ncertified mail a notice of intention to terminate setting forth the facts and\ncircumstances justifying termination of the financial institution's\nparticipation in this program. The financial institution shall have 30 days in\nwhich to respond in writing to the State Comptroller. If after considering the\nresponse of the financial institution, the State Comptroller determines that\ntermination is proper, or in the event the financial institution fails to\nrespond within 30 days, the State Comptroller shall send by certified mail a\nnotice of termination to the financial institution. Such termination shall\nbecome effective 30 days after the date such notice is mailed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
