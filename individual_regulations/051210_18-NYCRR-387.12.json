The per-household per-month amount prescribed in the\ngeneral notices published annually in the Federal Register. (b) Earned income deduction. A deduction of\n20 percent of gross earned income as defined in this Part. Such a calculation\nwill omit the earnings excluded prior to computing this deduction. This\ndeduction is not allowed with respect to determining an over issuance due to\nthe failure of a household to report earned income in a timely\nmanner. (c) Excess medical\ndeductions. Deductions consisting of that portion of medical expenses, excluding special diets, which are in excess of $35 per month and incurred by a\nhousehold member who meets the definition of elderly (age 60 and older) or\ndisabled as defined in this Part. Expenses of spouses or other persons\nreceiving benefits as a dependent of the SSI, disabled or blind recipient\n(unless otherwise eligible) shall not be allowable deductions. Persons\nreceiving emergency SSI benefits based on a presumption of eligibility shall be\nallowed this deduction. Allowable medical expenses are: (1)\nmedical and dental care, including\npsychotherapy and rehabilitation services performed by a qualified health\nprofessional; hospitalization or outpatient care, nursing care (including\nnursing care in the community), nursing home care, prescription drugs, over-the-counter medication (including insulin) when approved by a qualified\nhealth professional; costs of medical supplies, sickroom equipment or other\nprescribed equipment; health and hospitalization insurance policies, Medicare\npremiums, cost-sharing or spend-down expenses for medical assistance; dentures, hearing aids, prosthetics, prescribed eyeglasses, reasonable costs of\ntransportation and lodging to obtain medical services, costs of securing and\nthe cost of maintaining a seeing eye or hearing dog (including food and\nveterinarian bills), and maintaining an attendant, homemaker, home health aide, child care services, or housekeeper necessary for the care of the aged, infirm\nor ill. In addition an amount equal to the one-person coupon allotment shall be\ndeducted as an expense if the household furnishes the majority of the\nattendant's meals; (2)\npayments on\na loan (excluding interest) used to pay a one-time-only medical expense; and\n(3)\nattendant care costs that\nqualify under both the medical and dependent care deduction. (d) Dependent care. The deduction\nallowed for payments for the actual costs for the care of a child or other\ndependents including an incapacitated adult when necessary for a household\nmember to accept or continue employment, seek employment in compliance with the\njob search criteria (or an equivalent effort by those not subject to job\nsearch), or to attend training or to pursue education which is preparatory to\nemployment. (e) Child support\npayments to non-household members. Prior to determining the excess shelter\nexpense deduction, households are entitled to a deduction for child support\npayments made by a household member to or for an individual who is not a member\nof the household if such household member is legally obligated to make such\npayments. (f) Shelter deduction. (1)\n\nThe monthly shelter expenses in excess of\n50 percent of the household's income after all other deductions set forth in\nsubdivisions (a)-(d) of this section have been allowed. (2)\n\nThe maximum limit is published annually\nin the general notices in the Federal Register. This limit applies unless the household contains a member\nwho is elderly or disabled as defined in this Part. Such households shall\nreceive an excess shelter deduction for the monthly cost that exceeds 50\npercent of the household's monthly income after all other applicable\ndeductions. (3)\n\nOnly the\nfollowing shall be considered as shelter expenses: (i) Recurring charges including rent, mortgage, or other recurring charges leading to ownership of the shelter; e.g., loan and interest repayment for the purpose of a mobile home. (ii)\n\nProperty taxes (State and local\nassessments), insurance on the structure itself; the cost of fuel and\nelectricity for heating, cooling, cooking and domestic hot water, water, sewage, garbage and trash collection; the basic fee for one telephone including\nthe tax on the basic fee, and fees charged by the utility provider for initial\ninstallation of the utility. One-time deposits shall not be considered as\nshelter expenses. (iii)\n\nCosts for\nthe home if temporarily not occupied by the household because of employment or\ntraining away from the home, illness or abandonment caused by a natural\ndisaster or casualty loss. The members of the household must intend to return\nto the home. The current occupant, if any, is not permitted to claim the\nshelter expenses for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) purposes\nand the home must not be leased or rented during the absence of the\nhousehold. (iv)\n\nCharges for repair\nof the home which was substantially damaged or destroyed due to a natural\ndisaster such as fire or flood excluding those repair costs that are subject to\nreimbursement by private or public relief agencies, insurance or any other\nsource. (v) Standard allowances. A\nhousehold which is billed separately and on a recurring basis for heating\nand/or cooling costs, other utility costs and/or a telephone cost, or is\nentitled to a Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) payment or other Low Income\n\nHome Energy Assistance Act (LIHEAA) payment must use the standard allowances in\ncalculating shelter expenses. If actual documented expenses exceed the standard\nallowances, the actual costs may be used. When a household lives with other\nhouseholds and shares heating and/or cooling, utility and/or telephone expenses\nwith such households and is otherwise eligible to claim a standard allowance, the allowance must be divided equally among the number of households which\ncontribute towards payment of the bill whether or not all households\nparticipate in the SNAP. Such household may claim its prorated share of the\nstandard or its actual expenses, whichever is greater. If a prorated share of\nthe standard is used, the amount of the prorated share amount may not exceed\nthe total actual expense incurred for this item by the entire group which\nshares the expense. Households will be advised of the right to switch between\nthe use of actual documented expenses and the standard allowance. Households\nwill be permitted to switch between actual costs and the standard allowance for\nheating/cooling at the time of recertification and one additional time\nthereafter during each 12-month period. (a) The standard allowance for heating/cooling consists of the costs for heating\nand/or cooling the residence, electricity not used to heat or cool the\nresidence, cooking fuel, sewage, trash collection, water fees, fuel for heating\nhot water and basic service for one telephone. The standard allowance for\nheating/cooling is available to households which incur heating and/or cooling\ncosts separate and apart from rent and are billed separately from rent or\nmortgage on a regular basis for heating and/or cooling their residence, or to\nhouseholds entitled to a Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) payment or other\n\nLow Income Home Energy Assistance Act (LIHEAA) payment. A household living in\npublic housing or other rental housing which has central utility meters and\nwhich charges the household for excess heating or cooling costs only is not\nentitled to the standard allowance for heating/cooling unless they are entitled\nto a HEAP or LIHEAA payment. Such a household may claim actual costs which are\npaid separately. Households which do not qualify for the standard allowance for\nheating/cooling may be allowed to use the standard allowance for utilities or\nthe standard allowance for telephone. As of October 1, 2024, but subject to\nsubsequent adjustments as required by the United States Department of\n\nAgriculture (USDA), the standard allowance for heating/cooling for SNAP\napplicant and recipient households residing in New York City is $1,034; for\nhouseholds residing in either Suffolk or Nassau Counties, it is $962; and for\nhouseholds residing in any other county of New York State, it is\n$854. (b) The standard allowance\nfor utilities consists of the costs for electricity not used to heat or cool\nthe residence, cooking fuel, sewage, trash collection, water fees, fuel for\nheating hot water and basic service for one telephone. It is available to\nhouseholds billed separately from rent or mortgage for one or more of these\nutilities other than telephone. The standard allowance for utilities is\navailable to households which do not qualify for the standard allowance for\nheating/cooling. Households which do not qualify for the standard allowance for\nutilities may be allowed to use the standard allowance for telephone. As of\n\nOctober 1, 2024, but subject to subsequent adjustments as required by the USDA, the standard allowance for utilities for SNAP applicant and recipient\nhouseholds residing in New York City is $408; for households residing in either\n\nSuffolk or Nassau Counties, it is $378; and for households residing in any\nother county of New York State, it is $346. (c) The standard allowance for telephone\nconsists of the cost for basic service for one telephone. The standard\nallowance for telephone is available to households which do not qualify for the\nstandard allowance for heating/cooling or the standard allowance for utilities. As of October 1, 2024, but subject to subsequent adjustments as required by the\nUSDA, the standard allowance for telephone for all SNAP applicant and recipient\nhouseholds residing in New York State is $31. (d) OTDA must review the standard utility\nallowances annually, or at such time as otherwise directed by the USDA, and\nmake adjustments to reflect changes in costs subject to the approval and\ndirection of the USDA. Households whose SNAP benefits are reduced due to such\nchanges shall receive notification of the changes in accordance with section\n358-3.3\nof this Title. (vi)\n\nShelter costs for homeless\nhouseholds. Each household in which all members are homeless (homeless\nhousehold) and not receiving free shelter throughout the calendar month and\nwhich incurs or reasonably expects to incur shelter costs during a month are\neligible for a standard shelter allowance as a shelter expense. A homeless\nhousehold may, however, claim actual verified shelter costs as a shelter\nexpense if the actual costs are greater than the standard shelter allowance. A\nhomeless household which incurs no shelter costs during the month is not\neligible for a standard shelter allowance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
