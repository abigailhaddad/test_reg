  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 517.6 - Witnesses\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General rule of\ncompetency. Every person is competent to be a witness except as otherwise\nprovided in these rules. (b) Lack\nof personal knowledge. A witness may not testify to a matter unless evidence is\nintroduced sufficient to support a finding that the witness has personal\nknowledge of the matter. Evidence to prove personal knowledge may, but need\nnot, consist of the testimony of the witness. This subdivision is subject to\nthe provisions of Mil. R. Evid. 703, relating to opinion testimony by expert\nwitnesses. (c) Oath or affirmation. Before testifying, every witness shall be required to declare that the witness\nwill testify truthfully, by oath or affirmation administered in a form\ncalculated to awaken the witness's conscience and impress the witness's mind\nwith the duty to do so. (d) Interpreters. An interpreter is subject to the provisions of these rules\nrelating to qualifications as an expert and the administration of an oath or\naffirmation that the interpreter will make a true translation. (e) Competency of military judge as witness. (1)\n\nThe military judge presiding at the\ncourt-martial may not testify in that court-martial as a witness. No objection\nneed be made to preserve the point. (2)\n\nThis subdivision does not preclude the\nmilitary judge from placing on the record matters concerning docketing of the\ncase. (f) Competency of\ncourt member as witness. (1)\n\nAt the\ncourt-martial. A member of the court-martial may not testify as a witness\nbefore the other members in the trial of the case in which the member is\nsitting. If the member is called to testify, the opposing party, except in a\nspecial court-martial without a military judge, shall be afforded an\nopportunity to object out of the presence of the members. (2)\n\nInquiry into validity of findings or\nsentence. Upon an inquiry into the validity of the findings or sentence, a\nmember may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the\ncourse of the deliberations of the members of the court-martial or, to the\neffect of anything upon the member's or any other member's mind or emotions as\ninfluencing the member to assent to or dissent from the findings or sentence or\nconcerning the member's mental process in connection therewith, except that a\nmember may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information\nwas improperly brought to the attention of the members of the court-martial, whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any member, or whether there was unlawful command influence. Nor may the member's affidavit\nor evidence of any statement by the member concerning a matter about which the\nmember would be precluded from testifying be received for these\npurposes. (g) Who may\nimpeach. The credibility of a witness may be attacked by any party, including\nthe party calling the witness. (h) Evidence of character, conduct, and bias of witness. (1)\n\nOpinion and reputation evidence of\ncharacter. The credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by\nevidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but subject to these\nlimitations: (i) the evidence may refer only\nto character for truthfulness or untruthfulness; and\n(ii)\nevidence of truthful character is\nadmissible only after the character of the witness for truthfulness has been\nattacked by opinion or reputation evidence or otherwise. (2)\n\nSpecific instances of conduct. Specific\ninstances of conduct of a witness, for the purpose of attacking or supporting\nthe credibility of the witness, other than conviction of crime as provided in\n\nMil. R. Evid. 609, may not be proved by extrinsic evidence. They may, however, in the discretion of the military judge, if probative of truthfulness or\nuntruthfulness, be inquired into on cross-examination of the witness: (i) concerning character of the witness for\ntruthfulness or untruthfulness; or\n(ii)\nconcerning the character for\ntruthfulness or untruthfulness of another witness as to which character the\nwitness being cross-examined has testified. The giving of testimony, whether by an accused or by\nanother witness, does not operate as a waiver of the privilege against\nself-incrimination when examined with respect to matters which relate only to\ncredibility. (3)\n\nEvidence of bias. Bias, prejudice, or any motive to misrepresent may be shown\nto impeach the witness either by examination of the witness or by evidence\notherwise adduced. (i) Impeachment by evidence of conviction crime. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. For the purpose of\nattacking the credibility of a witness, evidence that the witness has been\nconvicted of a crime shall be admitted if elicited from the witness or\nestablished by public record during cross-examination but only if the crime: (i) was punishable by death, or imprisonment\nin excess of one year under the law under which the witness was convicted, and\nthe military judge determines that the probative value of admitting this\nevidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused; or\n(ii)\ninvolved dishonesty or false statement, regardless of the punishment. (2)\n\nTime limit. Evidence of a conviction\nunder this subdivision is not admissible if a period of more than 10 years has\nelapsed since the date of the conviction or of the release of the witness from\nthe confinement imposed for that conviction, whichever is the later date, unless the court determines, in the interests of justice, that the probative\nvalue of the conviction supported by specific facts and circumstances\nsubstantially outweighs its prejudicial effect. However, evidence of a\nconviction more than 10 years old as calculated herein, is not admissible\nunless the proponent gives to the adverse party sufficient advance written\nnotice of intent to use such evidence to provide the adverse party with a fair\nopportunity to contest the use of such evidence. (3)\n\nEffect of pardon, annulment, or\ncertificate of rehabilitation. Evidence of a conviction is not admissible under\nthis subdivision if: (i) the conviction has\nbeen the subject of a pardon, annulment, certificate of rehabilitation, or\nother equivalent procedure based on a finding of the rehabilitation of the\nperson convicted, and that person has not been convicted of a subsequent crime\nwhich was punishable by death, dishonorable discharge, or imprisonment in\nexcess of one year; or\n(ii)\nthe\nconviction has been the subject of a pardon, annulment, or other equivalent\nprocedure based on a finding of innocence. (4)\n\nJuvenile adjudications. Evidence of\njuvenile adjudications is generally not admissible under this subdivision. The\nmilitary judge, however, may allow evidence of a juvenile adjudication of a\nwitness other than the accused if conviction of the offense would be admissible\nto attack the credibility of an adult and the military judge is satisfied that\nadmission in evidence is necessary for a fair determination of the issue of\nguilt or innocence. (5)\n\nPendency of\nappeal. The pendency of an appeal therefrom does not render evidence of a\nconviction inadmissible. Evidence of the pendency of an appeal is\nadmissible. (6)\n\nDefinition. For\npurposes of this subdivision, there is a conviction in a court-martial case\nwhen a sentence has been adjudged. (j) Religious beliefs or opinions. Evidence\nof the beliefs or opinions of a witness on matters of religion is not\nadmissible for the purpose of showing that by reason of their nature the\ncredibility of the witness is impaired or enhanced. (k) Mode and order of interrogation and\npresentation. (1)\n\nControl by the military\njudge. The military judge shall exercise reasonable control over the mode and\norder of interrogating witnesses and presenting evidence so as to: (i) make the interrogation and presentation\neffective for the ascertainment of the truth; (ii)\navoid needless consumption of time; and\n(iii)\nprotect witnesses from\nharassment or undue embarrassment. (2)\n\nScope of cross-examination. Cross-examination should be limited to the subject matter of the direct\nexamination and matters affecting the credibility of the witness. The military\njudge may, in the exercise of discretion, permit inquiry into additional\nmatters as if on direct examination. (3)\n\nScope of cross-examination. Leading\nquestions should not be used on the direct examination of a witness except as\nmay be necessary to develop the testimony of the witness. Ordinarily leading\nquestions should be permitted on cross-examination. When a party calls a\nhostile witness or a witness identified with an adverse party, interrogation\nmay be by leading questions. (l) Writing used to refresh memory. If a\nwitness uses a writing to refresh his or her memory for the purpose of\ntestifying, either: (1)\nwhile testifying; or\n(2)\nbefore testifying, if the\nmilitary judge determines it is necessary in the interests of justice; an adverse party is entitled to have the writing produced\nat the hearing, to inspect it, to cross-examine the witness thereon, and to\nintroduce in evidence those portions which relate to the testimony of the\nwitness. If it is claimed that the writing contains privileged information or\nmatters not related to the subject matter of the testimony, the military judge\nshall examine the writing in camera, excise any privileged information or\nportions not so related, and order delivery of the remainder to the party\nentitled thereto. Any portion withheld over objections shall be attached to the\nrecord of trial as an appellate exhibit. If a writing is not produced or\ndelivered pursuant to order under this subdivision, the military judge shall\nmake any order justice requires, except that when the prosecution elects not to\ncomply, the order shall be one striking the testimony or, if in discretion of\nthe military judge it is determined that the interests of justice so required, declaring a mistrial. This subdivision does not preclude disclosure of\ninformation required to be disclosed under other provisions of these rules or\nthis Chapter. (m) Prior statements of witnesses. (1)\n\nExamining witness concerning prior\nstatement. In examining a witness concerning a prior statement made by the\nwitness, whether written or not, the statement need not be shown nor its\ncontents disclosed to him at that time, but on request the same shall be shown\nor disclosed to opposing counsel. (2)\n\nExtrinsic evidence of prior inconsistent\nstatement of witness. Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by a\nwitness is not admissible unless the witness is afforded an opportunity to\nexplain or deny the same and the opposite party is afforded an opportunity to\ninterrogate the witness thereon, or the interests of justice otherwise require. This provision does not apply to admissions of a party-opponent as defined in\n\nMil. R. Evid. 801(d)(2). (n) Calling and interrogation of witnesses by\nthe court-martial. (1)\n\nCalling by the court-\nmartial. The military judge may, sua sponte, or at the request of the members\nor the suggestion of a party, call witnesses, and all parties are entitle to\ncross-examine witnesses thus called. When the members wish to call or recall a\nwitness, the military judge shall determine whether it is appropriate to do so\nunder these rules or this Chapter. (2)\n\nInterrogation by the court-martial. The\nmilitary judge or members may interrogate witnesses, whether called by the\nmilitary judge, the members, or a party. Members shall submit their questions\nto the military judge in writing so that a ruling may be made on the propriety\nof the questions or the course of questioning and so that questions may be\nasked on behalf of the court by the military judge in a form acceptable to the\nmilitary judge. When a witness who has not testified previously is called by\nthe military judge or the members, the military judge may conduct the direct\nexamination or may assign the responsibility to counsel for any\nparty. (3)\n\nObjections. Objections\nto the calling of witnesses by the military judge or the members or to the\ninterrogation by the military judge or the members may be made at the time or\nat the next available opportunity when the members are not present. (o) Exclusion of witnesses. At the\nrequest of the prosecution or defense the military judge shall order witnesses\nexcluded so that they cannot hear the testimony of other witnesses, and the\nmilitary judge may make the order sua sponte.This subdivision does not\nauthorize exclusion of: (1)\nthe accused; or\n(2)\na member of an armed service\nor an employee of the State designated as representative of the State by the\ntrial counsel; or\n(3)\na person\nwhose presence is shown by a party to be essential to the presentation of the\nparty's case.
