  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 150.3 - Separate filing fees\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf several documents are submitted, each should be\naccompanied by a separate remittance of the respective fee and taxes, if any. Because some documents may take different courses in processing, following this\npractice will avoid delay that might otherwise result in the return of all\ndocuments even though one or more would have been acceptable for\nfiling. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n150.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
