  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8.131 - Executive Order No. 131: Establishing the Commission on Youth, Public Safety and Justice\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the State of New York has taken significant steps\nto strengthen rehabilitation and provide support for young people in the\njuvenile and adult justice systems, including the Close to Home initiative, Regional Youth Justice Teams, detention risk assessment, increasing\ncommunity-based services and alternatives to incarceration; and\nWHEREAS, as the State made those investments, juvenile\ncrime, violence and incarceration rates have substantially decreased to\nhistoric lows; and\nWHEREAS, the State, despite leading the nation in an array\nof youth justice reforms, is one of only two states that continue to prosecute\n16- and 17-year-olds through the adult criminal justice system, the vast\nmajority of whom are youth of color; and\nWHEREAS, youth incarcerated with adults are less likely to\nreceive the services they need to succeed and are at increased risk of violent\nor sexual assault, mental health issues, and suicide; and\nWHEREAS, analysis by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control\nand Prevention showed that the felony recidivism rate in one state was 34\npercent higher for youth whose cases were handled in adult court compared to\nyouth whose cases were handled outside of adult court; and\nWHEREAS, leading brain research indicates that the\ncognitive skills of youth are not fully developed, rendering them more\nsusceptible to peer pressure, less capable of mature judgment and consequential\nthinking, though highly responsive to interventions; and\nWHEREAS, the State is committed to further reducing crime\nby implementing policies that both promote public safety and improve outcomes\nfor court-involved youth; NOW THEREFORE, I, ANDREW M.
