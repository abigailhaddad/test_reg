  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 537.4 - Purchaser's, transferee's or assignee's liability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nFailure by the purchaser, transferee or assignee to withhold the funds from the\nseller, transferrer or assignor makes the purchaser, transferee or assignee\npersonally liable for the payment to the State of any and all sales and use\ntaxes, theretofore or thereafter determined to be due the State from the\nseller, transferrer or assignor. Where the purchaser, transferee or assignee\nwithholds the funds from the seller, transferrer or assignor but fails to give\ntimely notice, the purchaser, transferee or assignee is personally liable for\nthe payment to the State for any and all sales and use taxes (regardless of how\nthey arose), theretofore or thereafter determined to be due the State from the\nseller, transferrer or assignor, except where the purchaser is relieved of his\nobligation to withhold the funds pursuant to the provisions of subdivision (c)\nof section\n537.3\nof this Part. (2)\n\nThe purchaser, transferee or assignee is cautioned that when a properly filed bulk sale notice\nis received by the department more than 10 days prior to either the scheduled\ndate of sale or the actual date of sale, the department will deem the date or\nreceipt to be the 10th day prior to the later of the actual date of sale or the\nscheduled date of sale indicated in the notice. Therefore, where a bulk sale\nnotice is filed under these circumstances, the department will have more than\n90 days from the date the department actually receives the notice to notify the\npurchaser of any sales or use tax obligations owed by the seller. Where a\nrevised notice is filed, the date of receipt or, if applicable, the deemed date\nof receipt, of the revised notice will be used by the department in determining\nthe dates by which it must fulfill its obligations under subdivisions (a) and\n(c) of section\n537.6\nof this Part. If the actual date of sale is earlier than the proposed date of\nsale indicated in the notice, the purchaser has the obligation to file a\nrevised notice of sale. The filing of a revised notice of sale may result in\nthe department using an earlier date in determining the dates by which it must\nfulfill its obligations under subdivisions (a) and (c) of section\n537.6\nof this Part. However, the purchaser should be aware that should he fail to\nfile a revised notice of sale, the department will not adjust the dates by\nwhich it must fulfill its obligations under subdivisions (a) and (c) of section\n537.6\nof this Part even if the department becomes aware by some other means that an\nearlier sale has occurred. (b) In addition to any liability of the\nseller, transferrer or assignor for taxes for which the purchaser is liable, the purchaser is also liable for the sales taxes imposed upon the sale of any\ntangible personal property included in the bulk sale, including penalties and\ninterest, except property purchased for resale or otherwise exempt by any\nprovisions of article 28 of the Tax Law. (c) The liability of the purchaser, transferee or assignee for taxes for which the seller is liable shall not, however, exceed the sales price or the fair market value, determined as of the\ndate of the sale, transfer or assignment, of the business assets sold, whichever is greater. (d) The\nfollowing examples illustrate situations which may arise: Example 1:On June 1, 1990 a purchaser notifies the\ndepartment that a bulk sale will take place on July 20, 1990. The notice of\nsale is timely. However, since the notice was received more than 10 days prior\nto the scheduled date of sale, the department will deem the date of receipt to\nbe July, 10 1990, the 10th day prior to the scheduled date of sale. Therefore, the department will have until July 17th, 1990 to issue a notice of a possible\nclaim for sales and use taxes and until October 8, 1990 to assess the purchaser\nfor any sales and use tax liability owed by the seller. Example 2:Assume the same facts as in example 1, except\nthat on July 5, 1990 the purchaser notifies the department that the sale date\nwas changed and actually took place on June 25, 1990. Provided that a notice of\npossible claim for sales and use taxes owed by the seller has not already been\nsent in response to the prior notice of sale, the department will have until\n\nJuly 12, 1990 to issue such notice of possible claim. The department would then\nhave until October 3, 1990 to assess the purchaser for any sales and use tax\nliability owed by the seller. Example 3:Assume the same facts as in example 1, except\nthat the purchaser neglects to notify the department that the sale took place\nearlier than the date indicated in the notice of sale. On July 2, 1990 the\ndepartment learns from a business publication that the sale took place on June\n25, 1990. The department will still have until July 17, 1990 to issue a notice\nof possible claim for taxes due, and have until October 8, 1990 to assess the\npurchaser for any sales and use taxes owed by the seller. Example 4:The seller of a business owes New York State\n$5,000 in sales taxes (plus additional penalty and interest on such $5,000). The purchaser gives timely notice but fails to withhold any funds from the\nseller. The purchaser purchases all the business assets of the seller for\n$100,000. Such assets have a fair market value of $90,000. The purchaser is\nliable for only the $5,000 owed by the seller and the sales taxes, including\nany penalty and interest, imposed on the sale of the tangible personal\nproperty, the collection of which may be enforced against him in the same\nmanner as taxes imposed by article 28 of the Tax Law. Example 5:Assume the same facts as in Example 4, except\nthat the purchaser has withheld the sales proceeds from the seller but has\nfailed to give timely notice. The Division of Taxation gives notice to the\npurchaser of the total amount of taxes due from the seller within 90 days from\nreceipt of the notice (although untimely) by the purchaser. The purchaser is\nrequired to pay the $5,000 (plus the sales taxes, including penalty and\ninterest, imposed on the sale of the tangible personal property) to the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance from the funds withheld, and may turn over\nthe balance to the seller. Upon payment of the $5,000 (plus the sales taxes, including any penalty and interest imposed on the sale of tangible personal\nproperty), the purchaser's liability to the Department of Taxation and Finance\nis discharged. The seller will remain liable for any penalty and interest still\nowed on the $5,000. If the liability for taxes due on the sale of the tangible\npersonal property is paid out of the seller's funds, the seller may collect\nsuch amount from the purchaser. Example 6:The seller of a business owes New York State\n$150,000 in sales taxes (plus additional penalty and interest on such\n$150,000). The purchaser purchases all the business assets of the seller for\n$100,000. Such assets have a fair market value of $90,000 on the date of sale. The purchaser fails to withhold any funds from the seller. The purchaser is\nliable for $100,000, the amount of the purchase price (plus the sales taxes, including any penalty and interest, on the sale of the tangible personal\nproperty), the collection of which may be enforced against him in the same\nmanner as taxes imposed by article 28 of the Tax Law. Example 7:Assume the same facts as in Example 6, except\nthat such assets have a fair market value of $140,000. The purchaser is liable\nfor $140,000, the fair market value (plus the sales taxes, including any\npenalty and interest, imposed on the sale of tangible personal property), the\ncollection of which may be enforced against him in the same manner as taxes\nimposed under article 28 of the Tax Law. Example 8:Assume the same facts as in Example 6. The\npurchaser withholds the $100,000 purchase price from the seller but fails to\ngive timely notice. The Division of Taxation gives notice to the purchaser of\nthe total amount of taxes due ($150,000) from the seller within 90 days from\nthe receipt of the notice (although untimely) by the purchaser. Although the\npurchaser has withheld, he is liable for the $100,000, the amount of the\npurchase price (plus the sales tax, including penalty and interest, imposed on\nthe sale of the tangible personal property), and may not release the funds to\nthe seller. The purchaser is required to pay the entire $100,000 in the funds\nwithheld to the Department of Taxation and Finance. Upon payment of the full\n$100,000 by the purchaser, the seller remains liable for the balance or $50,000\n($150,000 minus $100,000), plus penalty and interest on the $150,000 and, in\naddition, the sales taxes, including any penalty and interest, imposed on the\nsale of the tangible personal property. Upon payment of the $100,000 to the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance by the purchaser, the purchaser also remains\nliable for the sales tax, including any penalty and interest, imposed on the\nsale of the tangible personal property. Example 9:Assume the same facts as in Example 8, except\nthat the fair market value is $140,000. The purchaser is required to make\npayment of the entire $100,000 to the Department of Taxation and Finance. The\npurchaser's remaining liability of $40,000 (plus the sales taxes, including any\npenalty and interest, imposed on the sale of the tangible personal property)\nmay be enforced and collected against him in the same manner as the taxes\nimposed by article 28 of the Tax Law. Example 10:Assume the same facts as in Example 8 in which\nthe purchaser has withheld but has failed to give timely notice. Assume, however, that the Division of Taxation has also failed to give notice to the\npurchaser of the total amount of taxes due from the seller within 90 days from\nthe receipt of the notice (although untimely) by the purchaser. The purchaser\nis discharged from his obligation to withhold the funds and may turn over such\nfunds to the seller. The purchaser remains liable for the sales taxes, including any penalty and interest, imposed on the sale of the tangible\npersonal property. Example 11:The individual proprietor of a business owes New\n\nYork State $120,000 in sales taxes plus penalty and interest. He decides to\nretire from the business and transfers all his business assets by way of gift\nto his son. The fair market value of the business assets at the time of\ntransfer is $100,000. The transferee fails to give notice of the transfer in\nbulk to the Department of Taxation and Finance until after the transfer. The\n\nDivision of Taxation gives notice to the transferee of the total amount of\ntaxes due from the transferrer within 90 days from the date of receipt of the\nuntimely notice from the transferee. The transferee is personally liable for\n$100,000, the fair market value of the transferred business assets. Example 12:A corporation which operates a retail department\nstore through five locations decides to sell one of its locations and to\ncontinue operating the remaining four. The corporation has been filing separate\nsales tax returns for each location and has an outstanding sales tax liability\nfrom one of the locations being retained. The sale of the one location is a\nbulk sale. The purchaser fails to withhold the sales proceeds from the seller. The purchaser is liable for the unpaid sales taxes of the corporation, up to\nthe purchase price or the fair market value of the business assets, whichever\nis greater. It is immaterial that the liability arose from a location other\nthan that being purchased by the purchaser. The method the corporation utilized\nto file returns is also not relevant in determining the purchaser's\nliability. (e) The\nliability of the purchaser, transferee or assignee is assessed and enforced in\nthe same manner as the liability for any tax imposed by article 28 of the Tax\n\nLaw. The purchaser, transferee or assignee will not become personally liable\nfor the penalties and interest owed by the seller, transferrer or assignor up\nto the date of the sale. However, a purchaser, transferee or assignee will be\nliable for any penalties and interest which accrue on the derivative liability\nof such purchaser, transferee or assignee. Such penalties and interest will\nbegin to accrue five days after the date the notice of claim for taxes due and\ndemand for payment thereof is issued by the Division of Taxation. Example 13:The owner of a business located in Albany, NY\nsells its furniture and fixtures for $110,000. The purchaser does not withhold\nthe $110,000 or any portion of it, nor does he give notice of the intended sale\nto the Department of Taxation and Finance but pays the entire $110,000 to the\nseller on the date of sale, and takes possession of the furniture and fixtures\nwhich have a fair market value, as of that date, of $150,000. Prior to the date\nof sale, the seller had collected $140,000 in sales tax from his customers but\nhad failed to pay over that amount to the Department of Taxation and Finance. Such taxes were then due and owing by the seller, together with penalty and\ninterest of $37,000 as of the date of sale. Accordingly, the total taxes, penalties and interest due from the seller as of the date of sale, resulting\nfrom the failure to pay over taxes collected by the seller, is $177,000. The\npurchaser is liable for $140,000 (the total tax due from the seller). In\naddition, both the seller and the purchaser are liable for the sales taxes\nimposed on the sale of the furniture and fixtures to the purchaser, which tax\nhad not been paid. Such taxes amount to $7,700 ($4,400 in statewide taxes and\n$3,300 in local taxes). Accordingly, the total amount of taxes owed by the\nseller as of the date of sale is $184,700 ($177,000 plus $7,700) plus any\npenalty and interest owed on the $7,700. The total amount of taxes owed by the\npurchaser is $147,700 ($140,000, the amount of tax owed by the seller, plus\n$7,700). The purchaser is also liable for any penalty and interest owed on the\n$7,700. Subsequent to the sale, the liability of the purchaser becomes finally\nand irrevocably fixed. At that time there has accrued additional interest of\n$17,000 on the $140,000 taxes due from the seller by virtue of the failure to\npay over such taxes to the Department of Taxation and Finance in a timely\nmanner. An additional $2,940 penalty and interest has accrued on the taxes of\n$7,700 which were imposed on the sale of the furniture and fixtures. Accordingly, on the date that the purchaser's liability has become finally and\nirrevocably fixed, the total taxes, penalty and interest due and owing by the\nseller for tax not remitted prior to the date of sale amounted to $194,000\n($140,000 taxes plus $54,000 penalty and interest), plus an additional $10,640\n($7,700 taxes plus $2,940 penalty and interest). The purchaser is liable for\nthe latter amount of $10,640, since the purchaser purchased the furniture and\nfixtures without paying the tax on such assets. The purchaser is also liable\nfor the $140,000 in tax owed by the seller plus the interest and penalties\nwhich have accrued on the purchaser's derivative tax liability from the date\nfive days after the date of issuance of the notice of determination and demand\nfor payment. (f) If the\npurchaser, transferee or assignee establishes that his failure to timely pay: (1)\nany amounts due with respect to his\nderivative liability for any taxes owed by the seller; or\n(2)\nany taxes due with respect to his\npurchase of tangible personal property as part of his purchase in bulk of\nbusiness assets, was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, the Department of Taxation and Finance may waive penalties and as much of the\ninterest as it is authorized to waive pursuant to law. Any such waiver with\nrespect to the purchaser, transferee or assignee, however, does not act as a\nwaiver on behalf of the seller, transferrer or assignor. (g) Upon receipt by the purchaser, transferee\nor assignee of the notice of the State's claim for taxes due and demand for\npayment thereof, within the 90 days after receipt of a notice of sale, transfer\nor assignment in bulk, the purchaser, transferee or assignee may make payment\nto the State from the funds withheld. Where the total of the (1) sales taxes\ndue from the seller, plus (2) the sales taxes, including penalty and interest, imposed on the sale of tangible personal property, is less than the amount\nwithheld, the purchaser, transferee or assignee may pay such total amount to\nthe State from the funds withheld. Where payment of the tax imposed on the sale\nof tangible personal property to the purchaser, transferee or assignee is made\nfrom the seller's, transferee's or assignee's funds, the seller, transferor or\nassignor may collect such tax from the purchaser, transferee or\nassignee. (h) Upon payment to the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance of such total amount, the purchaser, transferee or assignee is relieved of all liability for such amount and such\namount paid to the State is deemed satisfaction of the tax liability, and of\npenalties and interest with respect to the taxes imposed on the sale of\ntangible personal property, of both the purchaser, transferee or assignee and\nthe seller, transferrer or assignor to the extent of the amount of such\npayment. Where such total amount exceeds the amount in the fund, the purchaser, transferee or assignee may make payment to the State of the entire amount\nwithheld. In such case the purchaser, transferee or assignee and the seller, transferrer or assignor are liable only to the extent set forth in this\n\nPart. (i) Where the seller, transferor or assignor makes part payment of his tax liabilty or where assets\nof the seller are levied or executed upon by the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance, and the remaining outstanding liability of the seller for tax exceeds\nthe liability of the purchaser, transferee or assignee, the purchaser's, transferee's or assignee's liability continues without diminution. Example 14:The seller of a business owes New York State\n$150,000 in sales taxes. The purchaser purchases all the business assets of the\nseller for $100,000. The purchaser has failed to give timely notice or withhold\nany funds from the seller. The purchaser is liable for $100,000, the amount of\nthe purchase price (plus the sales taxes, including any penalty and interest, imposed on the sale of tangible personal property). The Department of Taxation\nand Finance recovers $40,000 from the seller. Since the balance of the seller's\nliability still due and owing is $110,000 (plus the sales taxes, including any\npenalty and interest, imposed on the sale of any tangible personal property), the purchaser is still liable for $100,000 (plus the sales taxes, including any\npenalty and interest imposed on the sale of any tangible personal\nproperty). Example 15:Assume the same facts as in Example 14, except\nthat the amount recovered from the seller is $70,000. The seller's tax\nliability remaining is $80,000 (plus the sales taxes, including any penalty and\ninterest, imposed on the sale of the tangible personal property). The\npurchaser's liability is thus reduced to $80,000 (plus the sales taxes, including penalty and interest, imposed on the sale of the tangible personal\nproperty. Example 16:Assume the same facts as in Example 14, except\nthat the Department of Taxation and Finance recovers $70,000 against the\npurchaser. The purchaser's outstanding liability is thereby reduced to $30,000\n(plus the sales taxes, including penalty and interest, imposed on the sale of\nany tangible personal property) and the seller's total tax liability is also\nreduced by $70,000. (j) Where there have been successive sales, transfers or assignments in bulk of\nbusiness assets, each successive purchaser, transferee or assignee in bulk of\nbusiness assetswill acquire a derivative liability, up to the greater of the\nconsideration given or fair market value of the business assets purchased, from\nall previous sales, transfers or assignments in bulk to the seller, transferrer\nor assignor for which an outstanding liability still exists. This is true even\nif the business assets acquired by the successor purchaser, transferee or\nassignee are not the same assets involved in the previous transactions and even\nif the successive bulk sales do not relate to the same business activity. Example 17:A Corporation, the seller of a business, owes\n\nNew York State $150,000 in sales taxes. B Corporation, the purchaser, purchases\nfrom the seller all of its business assets for $100,000. The assets have a fair\nmarket value of $95,000. The purchaser, B Corporation, neither gives notice nor\nwithholds any funds from the seller. B Corporation is liable for $100,000, the\namount of the purchase price (plus the sales taxes, including penalty and\ninterest, imposed on the sale of tangible personal property). Example 17:B Corporation now sells its business assets to C\nCorporation for $200,000. Such assets have a fair market value of $95,000. C\nCorporation also fails to give notice or withhold. At the time of the purchase\nby C Corporation, its seller, B Corporation, fails to pay over $60,000 of sales\ntaxes which it collected from its customers. C Corporation, the purchaser, is\nliable for the sales taxes owing by its seller, B Corporation. The taxes\ninclude the following: (1)\nthe\n$100,000 for which B Corporation was liable because of its failure to withhold\nfunds from A Corporation, (2)\nthe\n$60,000 in sales taxes which were not paid over by B Corporation to the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, and\n(3)\nthe sales taxes imposed on the sale of\ntangible personal property from A Corporation to B Corporation. In addition, C\nCorporation is also liable for the sales taxes imposed on the sale of tangible\npersonal property from B Corporation to C Corporation along with any related\npenalties and interest. Example 18:Assume the same facts as in Example 17, except\nthat the purchase price paid for the business assets by C Corporation was\n$90,000. C Corporation is liable for $95,000, the fair market value of the\nassets, plus the sales taxes, including any penalty and interest, imposed on\nthe sale of the tangible personal property from B Corporation to C\nCorporation. Example 19:P Corporation, which operated a grocery store\nfor 3 years, sells all of its business assets to Q Corporation for $100,000. The assets have a fair market value of $95,000. Q Corporation does not notify\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance of the sale until after it has taken\nplace, neither does Q Corporation withhold any funds. Because P Corporation\nfails to respond to the Division of Taxation's request that P provide the books\nand records relating to its operation of the grocery store, an estimated\nassessment of $75,000 in tax is issued against P Corporation. An assessment for\n$75,000 is also issued against Q Corporation which is liable for such amount as\npurchaser from P. Q Corporation now sells all of its business assets, which\nhave a fair market value of $95,000, to R Corporation for $100,000. R\nCorporation does not notify the Department of Taxation and Finance of the sale, nor withhold any funds. R Corporation is liable for the $75,000 for which Q is\nliable. Example 19:At a prehearing conference, Q Corporation\nreaches a settlement agreement with the Division of Taxation under which Q\nCorporation's liability is reduced to $50,000 in taxes. Q Corporation pays the\n$50,000 in taxes, plus the appropriate interest and penalty, and is released\nfrom any further liability for P Corporation's taxes. The release of Q\nCorporation from liability for the taxes owed by P releases R Corporation from\nliability for any taxes which Q Corporation is required to remit. Example 20:X, a sole proprietor, sells the convenience\nstore she operates to Y Corporation for $40,000. At the time of the bulk sale, the Division of Taxation conducts an audit of X and determines that she owes\n$4,000 in sales and use taxes relative to her operation of the store. X does\nnot pay the tax liability and Y Corporation fails to withhold and pay over to\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance the proceeds of the bulk sale. Y\nCorporation has a derivative liability for the $4,000 in tax owed by X. After\npurchasing the grocery store, Y Corporation decides to expand and opens two\nmore locations. A year later, Y Corporation sells one of the new locations to Z\nfor $60,000. The $4,000 derivative liability from the bulk sale by X is still\noutstanding. Even though the business assets sold by Y Corporation to Z are not\nthe same assets that X sold to Y Corporation, Z is still required to withhold\nand pay over to the Department of Taxtion and Finance the $4,000 in tax owed by\nY Corporation as a result of the bulk sale from X to Y. (k) The purchaser is also subject\nto the liabilities and remedies imposed under the provisions of article 6 of\nthe Uniform Commercial Code, where such article is applicable to the\ntransaction. (l) The purchaser is\nnot excused from any obligation or liability on his or her part, either because\nof the seller's failure to comply with the seller's obligations set forth in\nsection\n537.5\nof this Part or by virtue of the failure of the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance to comply with the provisions of subdivision (f) of section\n537.6\nof this Part (which subdivision relates to the issuance of bulk sales\ncertificates).
