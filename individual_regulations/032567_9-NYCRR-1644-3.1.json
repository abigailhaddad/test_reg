  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1644-3.1 - Issuance of bonds\n\nState Regulations\n\nAs described in Part 1643, Financing, the issuance of\nhousing bonds by the State is entirely within the discretion of the State\n\nComptroller. Bonds may, therefore, be issued by the State prior to the date of\nsubstantial completion, or subsequent thereto. The issuance of bonds\nsimultaneously with substantial completion will, ordinarily, be fortuitous. The\ndate of substantial completion has an important bearing on the debt service on\nthe bond issue, as it not only controls the apportionment of the interest\ncharge to development and operations, but also the provision for amortization. Prior to the date of substantial completion, debt service on the bond issue is\nlimited to the provision of interest only. Subsequent to the date of\nsubstantial completion, the debt service will include a provision for\namortization of the indebtedness, as well as the provision for\ninterest. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1644-3.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
