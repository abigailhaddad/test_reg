Tit. 2 § 38.5 - Excess in sinking fund accounts\n\nState Regulations\n\nAt the request of the issuer, the State Comptroller shall\ntransfer any surplus exceeding $100 in a sinking fund account to the issuer or\nto another sinking fund account of the issuer. Such request by the issuer shall\nnot be made more than once in any 12-month period. Such transfer shall occur on\nsuch day or days as may be agreed upon by the State Comptroller and the issuer. Thirty days prior to the date of transfer, the issuer shall deliver to the\n\nState Comptroller a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the\ncalculation of the amount of excess on deposit in the sinking fund account. Notwithstanding anything above to the contrary: (a) In the event the State Comptroller is not\nreimbursed as provided in section\n38.7\nof this Part, the State\n\nComptroller shall deduct the amount of the required reimbursement from any\nexcess on deposit in the sinking fund account; provided, however, that in no\nevent shall the State Comptroller use assets of the sinking fund account other\nthan the excess therein for such reimbursement. (b) In the event the State Comptroller, at\nthe request or with the consent of the issuer, has invested amounts on deposit\nin the sinking fund account in investments which do not mature or cannot be\nredeemed or for which the State Comptroller is unable to find a purchaser\n(after using reasonable efforts) at a time and in an amount sufficient to pay\nsuch excess to the issuer when requested by the issuer, the State Comptroller\nshall pay to the issuer as much of the excess as practicable at such time and\nshall pay the balance at the earliest time that it becomes available. Upon\ndefeasance, redemption or maturity of all of the sinking fund bonds payable\nfrom a sinking fund account, any excess remaining in the sinking fund account, regardless of size, shall be paid over to the issuer at the earliest date that\nsuch excess becomes available.
