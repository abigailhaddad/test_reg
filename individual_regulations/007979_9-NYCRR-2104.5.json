Housing\naccommodations vacant on the date the plan is presented or subsequently\nvacated, shall not be included in the computation of the 35 percent requirement\nexcept when the vacant housing accommodation is purchased for personal\noccupancy by a tenant of a controlled housing accommodation. (ii)\n\nSubsequent to the date the cooperative\nplan had been declared effective, the tenants of controlled housing\naccommodations had been served with a written notice that the plan had been\ndeclared effective, setting forth the terms of sale and the names of the\ntenants of the controlled housing accommodations who had purchased the stock\nallocated to their own housing accommodations or to vacant housing\naccommodations and the names and addresses of other purchasers of vacant\nhousing accommodations; and that the tenants of controlled housing\naccommodations who had not as yet purchased, still had the exclusive right, for\na period of 30 days from the date of service of the notice, to purchase the\nstock allocated to their housing accommodations on the terms previously offered\nto the tenants; except where (a) the cooperative plan had been declared\neffective prior to July 1, 1955, and (b) prior to that date the tenant of a\ncontrolled housing accommodation in the premises had received written notice or\nnotices that for a period of not less than 30 days he had the right to purchase\nthe stock allocated to his housing accommodation at the price and terms\nspecified in said plan, and (c) on July 1, 1955 such stock was held or was\nthereafter reacquired by the cooperative or by a sponsor, nominee of the\ncooperative or by any other person associated with the formulation of the plan, and (d) such stock was offered after July 1, 1955 for sale for personal\noccupancy at the same or different terms than previously offered to the tenant\nof such controlled housing accommodation, the latter was given a written notice\nof the offer to sell and the the right for a period of 30 days to purchase the\nstock on the terms specified in such offer.

This requirement shall\nnot apply where the landlord is a former member of the Armed Forces of the\n\nUnited States of America who obtained a loan for use in purchasing housing\naccommodations guaranteed in whole or part by the Administrator of Veterans\n\nAffairs. The contract of sale of the real property referred to in this\nsubdivision shall: (1)\ngive the purchaser the\nright of immediate possession and assign all of the rents and income from the\nproperty to the purchaser; (2)\nnot\ngive the purchaser the right to cancel because of failure to secure occupancy\nof the premises; (3)\nprovide that\nthe risk of damage to or destruction to the building on the premises by fire or\nother cause or casualty shall be the risk of the purchaser, and any such damage\nor destruction shall not excuse such purchaser from paying the price for the\npremises nor from performing the other conditions and covenants of the\ncontract; (4)\nrequire the purchaser\nat all times to keep the buildings on the premises insured for the benefit of\nthe seller in an amount equal to at least the unpaid balance owing under the\ncontract to the seller; (5)\nrequire\nthe purchaser to pay all taxes, assessments, and water rents which shall\nthereafter be taxed or assessed upon or placed against the\nproperty.
