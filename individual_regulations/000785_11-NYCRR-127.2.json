  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 127.2 - Accounting requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No insurer subject to this Part shall, for reinsurance ceded, take reserve credit by reducing a liability or establishing an asset in any financial statement filed with the superintendent if, by the terms of the reinsurance agreement, in substance or effect, any of the following conditions exists: (1)\nrenewal expense allowances, provided or to be provided to the ceding insurer by the assuming insurer in any accounting period, are not sufficient to cover anticipated allocable renewal expenses of the ceding insurer on the portion of the business reinsured. Those expenses include commissions, premium taxes and direct expenses including, but not limited to, billing, valuation, claims and maintenance expected by the ceding insurer at the time the business is reinsured; (2)\nthe ceding insurer can be deprived of surplus or assets at the assuming insurer's option or automatically upon the occurrence of some event, such as the insolvency of the ceding insurer, except that termination of the reinsurance agreement by the assuming insurer for nonpayment of reinsurance premiums or other amounts due, such as modified coinsurance reserve adjustments, interest and adjustments on funds withheld, and tax reimbursements, shall not be considered to be a deprivation of surplus or assets; (3)\nthe ceding insurer is required to reimburse the assuming reinsurer for negative experience under the reinsurance agreement, except that offsetting experience refunds against current and prior years' losses under the agreement or payment by the ceding insurer of an amount equal to the current and prior years' losses under the agreement upon voluntary termination of in-force reinsurance by the ceding insurer shall not be considered a reimbursement to the reinsurer for negative experience. Voluntary termination does not include terminations that occur because of provisions which allow the assuming insurer to reduce its risk under the agreement; for example, a provision allowing the assuming insurer to increase reinsurance premiums or risk and expense charges; (4)\nthe interest rate applied to current and prior years' losses exceeds the rate calculated according to the formula set forth in subparagraph (8)(iii) of this subdivision, or, if assets are segregated in accordance with subparagraph (8)(i) of this subdivision, the interest rate reflecting the segregated portfolio's investment earnings including all realized and unrealized gains and losses. For purposes of this paragraph, the application of a negative interest rate is not required; (5)\nthe ceding insurer must, at specific points in time scheduled in the agreement, terminate or automatically recapture all or part of the reinsurance ceded; (6)\nthe ceding insurer may be obligated to pay to the assuming insurer amounts other than from income realized from the insured policies. For example, a ceding insurer pays reinsurance premiums, or other fees or charges to an assuming insurer which are greater than the direct premiums collected by the ceding insurer on the insurance policies or contracts reinsured; (7)\nthe ceding insurer does not transfer to the assuming insurer all of the significant risks inherent in the insurance policies or contracts reinsured. The following table identifies, for a representative sampling of types of insurance policies or contracts, the risks which are considered to be significant. For policies or contracts not specifically included, the risks determined to be significant shall be consistent with this table: Risk Categories\n(a) Morbidity\n(b) Mortality\n(c) Lapse\n\nThis is the risk that an insurance policy or contract will voluntarily terminate prior to the recoupment of a statutory surplus strain experienced at issue of the policy.................................................... (d) Credit Quality (C1)\n\nThis is the risk that invested assets supporting the reinsured business will decrease in value. The main hazards are that assets will default or that there will be a decrease in earning power. It excludes market value declines due to changes in interest rate.................................................... (e) Reinvestment (C3)\n\nThis is the risk that interest rates will fall and funds reinvested (coupon payments or monies received upon asset maturity or call) will therefore earn less than expected. If asset durations are less than liability durations, the mismatch will increase.................................................... (f) Disintermediation (C3)\n\nThis is the risk that interest rates rise and policy loans and surrenders increase or maturing contracts do not renew at anticipated rates of renewal. If asset durations are greater than the liability durations, the mismatch will increase. Policyholders will move their funds into new products offering higher rates. The company may have to sell assets at a loss to provide for these withdrawals.....................................................

The following is an acceptable formula: Rate =\n2(I + CG)\n/\nX + Y - I - CG\nWhere: I is the net investment income earned, CG is capital gains less capital losses\nX is the current year cash and invested assets plus investment income due and accrued less borrowed money\nY is the same as X but for the prior year\n(9)\nsettlements are: (i) made less frequently than quarterly or payments due from the assuming insurer are not made in cash within 90 days of the settlement date; or\n(ii)\nnot based on actual experience of the insurance policies being reinsured (including all components of the formula set forth in subparagraph [8][iii] of this subdivision) or reasonable estimates thereof; provided, however, any settlements based on reasonable estimates must be recalculated at least annually to reflect the actual experience of the year; (10)\nthe ceding insurer is required to make representations or warranties not reasonably related to the business being reinsured; (11)\nthe ceding insurer is required to make representations or warranties about future performance of the business being reinsured; (12)\nthe assuming insurer is not required to fully reimburse the ceding insurer for its share of dividends paid on participating policies or additional amounts paid or credited arising from the declaration of interest, mortality or expense more favorable than guaranteed on policies subject to the reinsurance agreement, unless the agreement contains another provision relating to the reimbursement of dividends and/or additional amounts paid or credited which is approved by the superintendent pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section; or\n(13)\nthe ceding insurer does not transfer all of the significant risks inherent in the insurance policies or contracts reinsured, and, in substance or effect, the expected potential liability to the ceding insurer remains basically unchanged. (b) Notwithstanding that the reinsurance agreement provides for one or more of the conditions specified subdivision (a) of this section, an insurer subject to this Part may take reserve credit in such amount as the superintendent may deem consistent with the Insurance Law or this Title, if the insurer obtains the prior approval of the superintendent. In reviewing a request for approval, the superintendent shall consider, among other things: (1)\nwhether, and the extent that, the terms of the reinsurance agreement provide for the transfer of all significant risks to the assuming insurer; (2)\nwhether taking the reserve credit by reducing liabilities or establishing assets would distort the annual statement of the ceding insurer; and\n(3)\nwhether approval to take such reserve credit would create a situation that may be hazardous to policyholders and the people of this State. (c) Any reinsurance agreement entered into after the effective date of this Part which involves the reinsurance of insurance policies issued prior to the effective date of the agreement, and every amendment thereto, shall be filed by the ceding insurer with the superintendent within 30 days from its date of execution. Each filing shall include data detailing the financial impact of the transaction. (d) Any increase in surplus net of Federal income tax resulting from arrangements described in subdivision (c) of this section shall be identified separately on the insurer's statutory financial statement as a surplus item (aggregate write-ins for gains and losses in surplus in the capital and surplus account, page 4 of the annual statement). Recognition of the surplus increase as income shall be reflected on a net of tax basis in the \"Reinsurance ceded\" line, page 4 of the annual statement as earnings emerge from the business reinsured. (e) The ceding insurer's actuary who signs the financial statement actuarial opinion with respect to valuation of reserves shall consider this Part and any applicable actuarial standards of practice when determining the proper credit in financial statements filed with the superintendent. The actuary should maintain adequate documentation and be prepared upon request to describe the actuarial work performed for inclusion in the financial statements and to demonstrate that the work conforms to this Part.
