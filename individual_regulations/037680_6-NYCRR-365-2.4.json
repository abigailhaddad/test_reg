Tit. 6 §§ 365-2.4 - Permit application requirements\n\nState Regulations\nA facility that treats, stores or transfers RMW, which is\nnot exempt or subject to the registration provisions of Subpart 365-1 or\nsection\n365-2.3\nof this Part, must obtain a\npermit from the department. The permit application must include the\nrequirements identified in this section and section\n360.16\nof this Title, and include a\ndescription of how the facility will comply with the operating requirements of\nsection\n360.19\nof this Title, and sections\n365-2.5, 365-2.6, 365-2.7, and\n365-2.8\nof this Subpart. An\napplication for a permit under this section must include: (a) A waste control plan that describes: (1)\nthe notification program to instruct the\ngenerators who will use the facility of the types of RMW that will be accepted\nand/or treated at the facility including source and quantity. The description\nof the quantity must specify the expected average and maximum daily and annual\namounts, on a weight and volume basis. These quantities must be specified for\neach general category of RMW; (2)\nthe service area, that includes a list of all planning units and other\ngenerators that are served must be included; (3)\nspecial waste management if any of the\nfollowing wastes are accepted: (i) reusable\nsecondary containers including sharps containers; (ii)\nreusable medical devices, disposed as\nRMW by the generator; (iii)\nwaste\n(including sharps) containing pharmaceuticals or other chemicals; (iv)\nwastes from a biosafety level 3 or 4\nlaboratory or other generation area; or\n(v) waste containing select agents or toxins\nof biological origin listed in 7 CFR Part\n331, 9 CFR Part\n121\nand 42 CFR Part\n73, as incorporated by reference in section\n360.3\nof this Title, or other\ninfectious wastes. (4)\nhow the facility will ensure that it only receives RMW or other wastes capable\nof being managed at the facility; (5)\nhow the facility will identify, store, and dispose of all waste received that cannot be managed at the facility, such\nas anatomical or pathological waste; (6)\nthe methods used to inspect all\ncontainers received to ensure that they are in compliance with this\n\nSubpart; (7)\nthe methods used to\nmanage the waste that ensures odor, litter and vectors are\ncontrolled; (8)\nhow the facility\nwill be managed to ensure compliance with all applicable storage\nrequirements; (9)\nhow the facility\nwill handle spills, breached containers or contaminated equipment used for\nhandling the waste; (10)\nhow\ninventory will be managed; and\n(11)\nthe method that will be used to manage the required tracking forms. (b) Operation and\nmaintenance plan. The operation and maintenance plan must include: (1)\na description of the overall operation of\nthe facility including: (i) a radioactive\nwaste detection plan that includes procedures for detecting prohibited\nradioactive material; operation and maintenance documents for radiation\ndetectors including investigation alarm set point settings and calibration\nmethods; and response procedures to be implemented when radioactive waste is\ndetected; (ii)\nthe method for\nunloading; and\n(iii)\nthe method for\ndecontaminating emptied reusable RMW containers and facility equipment which\nare contaminated with RMW as follows: (a) for\ncleaning, use of a detergent and sufficient agitation or pressure to remove\nvisible contamination from a surface; and\n(b) for disinfection, exposure to hot water\nat a temperature of at least 180 degrees Fahrenheit (82 degrees Celsius) for a\nminimum of 15 seconds, or exposure to a chemical disinfectant or a pesticide\nregistered for use by the department and used according to the registered label\ndirections. (2)\na list of the type, purpose, size, capacity, and associated detention times for all RMW storage, treatment, and\ntransfer equipment and structures, with supporting capacity\ncalculations; (3)\na process flow\ndiagram for RMW management during operation. The flow diagram must indicate the\naverage and maximum daily quantity of material handled on a weight and volume\nbasis; (4)\na description of all\nsecurity measures used during operation of the facility; (5)\nthe operational procedures for each major\nfacility component involved in RMW management; (6)\na description of monitoring and\ninspection that will be used to identify and correct equipment malfunctions or\ndeteriorations, operator errors, and other malfunctions; (7)\na description of the proposed measures to\nhandle RMW during periods of routine maintenance, emergencies, equipment\nbreakdown, or facility start-up and shutdown; (8)\na description of the daily cleaning and\nmaintenance operations and scheduled downtime maintenance each year and\nanticipated schedules for major equipment replacement; (9)\na description of how all equipment, personal protective equipment (PPE), or other items that have contacted RMW\nwill be disinfected including identification of the disinfectant or pesticide\nproposed to be used; and\n(10)\na\nlist of receiving facilities that will be used for treatment or\ndisposal. (c) Personnel training and safety plan. The plan must include: (1)\na description of the employee training\nprogram that will be used to teach employees how to correctly operate the\nequipment they must operate and to discover problems with that\nequipment; (2)\na general awareness\nand familiarization component that outlines how each employee will become\nfamiliar with the risks associated with the handling of the RMW and how those\nrisks can be minimized; and\n(3)\na\ntraining component on how to manage compromised packaging, spills, emergencies, or unauthorized wastes. (d) Contingency plan. The plan must describe the actions that will be taken to\naddress potential operational problems including, but not limited to, compromised packaging, equipment malfunction or breakdown, delivery of\nunauthorized waste, waste not packaged appropriately, spills, fire, explosion, power failure, excessive noise, unacceptable odors, litter, and vectors. The\nplan must also include a contingency for treatment or disposal should\nprocessing equipment be non-functional for a period longer than seven calendar\ndays. (e) A wash-water\nmanagement plan. The plan must describe the facility's drainage system and\nthe amount, with supporting calculations, of wash-water emanating from the\ncleaning of areas, reusable containers or equipment that have come in contact\nwith RMW and the method to collect, store, treat or dispose of\nwash-water. (f) Treatment equipment description. Treatment facilities must provide a detailed description\nof the treatment device(s) including: (1)\nan outline of the equipment features\n(\ne.g., manufacturer name, model number, capacity and material\nof construction), ancillary equipment, physical characteristics and function; and a drawing of the equipment showing piping and instrumentation; (2)\nevidence of manufacturer efficacy\ntesting, including the use of biological indicators analyzed by an independent\nlaboratory; (3)\na list of the\noperating parameters (\ne.g., temperature, pressure, time, irradiation or chemical levels, etc.) that will be attained for microbial\ninactivation and treatment; (4)\nthe\nfrequency, location, and method for monitoring the operating\nparameters; (5)\nthe procedures for\nand frequency of calibration of all instruments and controls; (6)\nthe procedures for loading the treatment\ndevice and unloading the treated waste; and\n(7)\nfor facilities using an alternative\ntreatment system, a copy of the NYSDOH approval issued to the system\"s\nmanufacturer or operator.
