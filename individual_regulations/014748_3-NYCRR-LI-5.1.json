  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 5.1 - Revolving credit loans under banking law, section 470\n\nState Regulations\nA credit union inquired whether it had the power to approve\nlines of credit for its members and whether it could, in effect, enter\nrevolving credit agreements with such members. Relying on section\n470\nof the Banking\n\nLaw, which requires that each loan application to a credit union \"must be made\nin writing and must state the purpose for which the loan is desired and the\nsecurity offered,\" the department concluded that a credit union is foreclosed\nfrom issuing a \"line of credit\" since the purpose of each advance will not be\nknown to the credit union, nor will its credit committee have the opportunity\nto pass on the wisdom of granting each advance. The department noted that the reason for the credit union's\nrequesting this authorization might have been related to the inconvenience\ncaused by the statutory requirement that the credit union's credit committee\npass on every loan. Therefore, the department pointed out that, to a meaningful\nextent, this inconvenience has been eliminated by chapter 68 of the Laws of\n1969 which authorized the credit committee of a credit union having shares in\nexcess of $50,000 to appoint loan officers, which officers are authorized to\nmake certain loans. DATED: July 22, 1969\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 5.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
