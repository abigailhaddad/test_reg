  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 143.15 - Installment plans for residential customers\n\nState Regulations\n\nNo such corporation shall terminate service to a customer\nbecause of the customer's failure to pay for service unless the corporation has\nfirst offered a monthly installment plan that is just and equitable. Each\ncorporation must offer a just and equitable monthly plan to all customers whose\nservice has been disconnected for nonpayment. To the extent practicable, the\nmonthly installment plan should be based on the customer's ability to pay, past\npayment history, the amount of indebtedness, and the availability of other\nresources. The monthly installment plan should require a customer to pay\ncurrent bills and a portion of past indebtedness. A new monthly installment\nplan need not be offered to a customer who is in default on an existing\none. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n143.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
