  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 578.4 - General values of wetlands\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Flood\ndamage and storm water control. Wetlands slow water runoff and temporarily\nstore water, slowing movement of the crest downstream and lowering its\nelevation, thus helping to protect downstream areas from flooding and siltation\nor sedimentation. Public health and private property in one part of a watershed\nmay be harmed if wetlands are destroyed or substantially altered in upstream\nparts of that watershed. (b) Wildlife habitat. Wetlands are of unparalleled value as wildlife habitat. Many\nof the wetland bird species, such as ducks, geese, herons and the endangered\nbald eagle, are migratory. They must have nesting, migrating and wintering\nhabitat. The destruction of one kind of habitat in one part of the State will\nreduce populations in other parts of the State or country and deprive\nbird-watchers, hunters and others of recreational opportunities. Where a\nspecific wetland is the only known location of a key endangered species\nhabitat, destruction of that wetland may threaten the survival of the\nspecies. (c) Protection of water\nresources and valuable watersheds through pollution treatment or sediment\ncontrol. The protection of surface and subsurface water resources afforded by\nwetlands benefits all potential users of those water resources. The cleansing\naction of wetlands, through sedimentation and oxidation or precipitation of\npollutants, may provide water cleaner than would be the case if the wetlands\nwere destroyed. The loss of wetlands may result in a decline in water quality\ndownstream or in adjacent lakes. (d) Recreation. Wetlands provide spawning and\nnursery grounds for several species of fish. The availability of these fish may\nbe adversely affected by the loss of these or adjacent wetlands. Nutrients\nsupplied by wetlands are often important to the fisheries food chains of\nadjacent waters. In addition to their importance to fishermen, many wetland\nareas provide important hunting, boating, hiking, birdwatching, photography, and other recreational opportunities. (e) Other values. Wetlands provide\nopportunities for scientific research, visual variety and open space, and\neducational benefits. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n578.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
