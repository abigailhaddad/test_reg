  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4820.16 - Drawing of numbers\n\nState Regulations\n\nThere shall be two persons present at the receptacle from\nwhich the objects, or balls are drawn; one person shall remove the ball from\nthe receptacle, observe the letter and the number, and hand it to the other\nperson who shall raise the ball to display the letter and number to the players\nand announce the letters and the complete numbers being called accurately and\naudibly to all players present. Where there is an audio-video system in\noperation, the caller may be the sole person present at the receptacle from\nwhich the objects or balls are drawn, provided the caller positions each ball\nbefore the camera to clearly display the letter and number appearing on each\nball to the players via the video monitor(s). When an audio-video system is in\noperation, the caller shall announce the next letter and number in its entirety\nwhile the image of that letter and number are clearly displayed on the video\nmonitor(s) and shall raise the ball to display the letter and number to the\nplayers before placing it in the appropriately numbered space at the caller's\nstation. The caller shall not be required to handle the ball when a hands-free\nbingo receptacle approved by the commission is utilized, but shall be required\nto announce both the letter and the number while the image of that letter and\nnumber are clearly displayed on the video monitor(s). Speed-up games such as\nthe wild number game in which players mark those numbers appearing on their\nface-cards whose second digits match the wild number's single digit number (or\nits second digit if the wild number is a two-digit number) so designated by the\nlicensed authorized organization are permitted only when the bingo system\nutilized has a wild number function that automatically causes the bingo display\nboard to illuminate the wild number and all numbers corresponding with it. Once\nremoved, no ball shall be returned to the receptacle until after the conclusion\nof the game. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4820.16\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
