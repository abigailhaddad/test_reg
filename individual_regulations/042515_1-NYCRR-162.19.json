New York State Seal of Quality iceberg lettuce shall be\nheads of lettuce that are of similar varietal characteristics, fresh, green, not soft, not burst; free from decay, worm injury, russet spotting, doubles; free from damage by tipburn, downy mildew, field freezing, discoloration, or\nany other cause. Each head shall be fairly well trimmed. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nSimilar varietal\ncharacteristics\nmeans that the heads in any container have the same\ncharacteristic leaf growth. For example, lettuce of the Iceberg and Big Boston\ntypes shall not be mixed. (2)\n\nFresh\nmeans that the head as a whole has normal succulence and\nthe wrapper leaves and the outermost head leaves are not more than slightly\nwilted. (3)\n\nGreen\nmeans that one-half or more of the exterior surface of the head, exclusive of\nthe wrapper leaves, has at least a light green color. (4)\n\nBurst\nmeans that the\nhead is split or broken open. (5)\n\nDoubles\nmeans two heads on the same stem. (6)\n\nClosely trimmed\nmeans\nthat the butt is trimmed off closely below the point of attachment of the outer\nleaves, and that on a head of Iceberg type lettuce, wrapper leaves does not\nexceed three in number. (7)\n\nCap leaf\nis the first head leaf. This is the outermost leaf\nwhich fairly closely enfolds the compact portion of the head, some portion of\nwhich extends to the top of the crown. The tip of the leaf may be separated\nfrom the head: provided, that the separation does not exceed more than 1 1/4\ninches (31.8 mm) in height from the compact portion of the head. (i) All leaves outside of the cap leaf are\nwrapper leaves. (ii)\n\nOn enlongated\nor pointed heads the inner leaves that closely enfold the head three-fourths of\ntheir length are head leaves. (8)\n\nDamage\nmeans any\nspecific defect or any combination of defects which materially detracts from\nthe appearance, or the edible or marketing quality of the lettuce. (9)\n\nSerious damage\nmeans any\nspecific defect or any combination of defects, which seriously detracts from\nthe appearance, or the edible or marketing quality of the lettuce. (c) Tolerances. In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading\nand handling, the following tolerances, by count, shall be permitted in any\nlot: (1)\n\nFor defects. Eight percent\nfor heads of lettuce which fail to meet the requirements of the specifications: provided, that included in the amount not more than three percent shall be\nallowed for soft heads; and provided further, that not more than four percent\nshall be allowed for defects causing serious damage; included in this latter\namount not more than two percent for heads which are affected by decay on the\nwrapper leaves and not more than one percent for heads which are affected by\ndecay on the compact portion of the head. (d) Application of tolerances. In order to meet the requirements of the specifications, the average percentage of defective specimens in the lot, based on sample\ninspection shall be within the tolerance specified, and the number of defective\nspecimens in individual packages shall be within the limitations set forth in\nthe following table: Lot tolerance, percent\n\nTotal number of\ndefective heads permitted in any package\n24\n18 or 20\n30\nover 30\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n3\n3\n2\n3\n4\n4\n3\n3\n4\n4\n5\n3\n3\n4\n5\n8\n5\n4\n6\n7\n(e) Solidity. Solidity of lettuce may be specified in connection with the\ngrade in accordance with any of the following classifications: (1)\n\nHard\nmeans that the head\nis compact and solid. This term represents the highest degree of\nsolidity. (2)\n\nFirm\nmeans\nthat head is compact, but may yield slightly to moderate\npressure. (3)\n\nFairly\nfirm\nmeans that although the head is not firm, it is not soft and\nspongy, and has good head formation. (4)\n\nSoft\nmeans that the head\nis easily compressed or spongy. (f) Packing. The following terms should be used in describing the\ntightness of pack. Lettuce shall be vacuum cooled and in new closed standard\ncartons. (1)\n\nExcessively\ntight\nmeans that the heads are so tightly packed that they are damaged\nby pressure causing distortion or crushing of the heads or breaking of the\nmidribs. The term should be used only when such is the case. (2)\n\nTight\nmeans that the\nlayers are completely and tightly filled without injury to the heads. This\nrepresents the most desirable pack. (3)\n\nFairly tight\nmeans that\nthe layers are filled, but the pack is somewhat loosely arranged, and in\ncartons usually additional heads, but not a complete row, can be\ninserted. (4)\n\nSlack\nmeans that the pack is very loose in layers and in\nstandard cartons an additional row or layer can be added. All packages are subject to approval by the Department of\n\nAgriculture and Markets. Package approval shall be based upon the ability of\nthe package to maintain the quality standards and integrity of the\nproduct. (g) Markings. Iceberg lettuce packaged and offered for sale under the\n\nSeal of Quality program shall have affixed the official seal\ndesignation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
