  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 387.14 - Determination of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A household's\neligibility is determined by considering the household's circumstances for the\nentire month during which the application is made. For a resident of a public\ninstitution who applies jointly for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and food\nstamps as part of the Federal Social Security Administration's (SSA's)\n\nPre-release Program for the Institutionalized, eligibility is determined by\nconsidering the applicant's circumstances for the entire month in which the\napplicant was released from the institution. (1)\nA household's benefit level for the\ninitial month of certification is based on the day of the month the household\napplies for benefits. A household must receive benefits which are prorated from\nthe day of application to the end of the initial month. A household which\napplies for benefits at any time after the end of its certification period will\nalso have their first full month's benefits prorated from the date of\napplication for recertification to the end of the initial month. For a resident\nof a public institution who applies jointly for SSI and food stamps as part of\nthe SSA's Pre-release Program for the Institutionalized, the benefit level for\nthe initial month of certification is based on the date of the month the\napplicant is released from the institution. Such applicant must receive\nbenefits which are prorated from the day of the applicant's release from the\ninstitution to the end of the month. Initial month\nmeans: (i) the first month for which the household\nis certified for participation in the food stamp program following any period\nduring which the household was not certified for participation; and\n(ii)\nin the case of a migrant or seasonal\nfarmworker household, the first month for which a household is certified for\nparticipation in the food stamp program provided such household applies\nfollowing a period of more than 30 days in which the household was not\ncertified for participation. (2)\n\nCollection of overissuances. A social\nservices district must collect any overissuance of food stamp benefits issued\nto a household by: (i) direct\npayment; (ii)\nreducing the\nallotment of the household as provided in paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision; (iii)\nwithholding\namounts from unemployment compensation from a member of the household, provided\n\nState computer supports are in place; (iv)\nrecovering from Federal pay or a Federal\nincome tax refund, provided State computer supports are in place; or\n(v) any other means as directed by the State. Social services districts may use additional means to\ncollect overissuances provided such means are cost effective and do not violate\nany other provisions of this Part. (3)\n(i) Households applying for benefits after the 15th of the month, which have\ncompleted the application, provided the verification required by section\n387.8\n(c) of this\n\nPart within 30 days of the date of application, and have been determined to be\neligible to receive benefits for the initial month of application and the month\nfollowing the initial month of application, must have prorated benefits for the\ninitial month of application and the first full month of benefits made\navailable to them at the same time and within the time periods specified in\nthis Part. (ii)\n\nHouseholds applying\nfor benefits after the 15th of the month which have been determined to be\neligible for expedited service, as set forth in section\n387.8\n(a) of this\n\nPart, must have benefits made available to them as follows: (a) Households which have been determined to\nbe eligible for expedited service pursuant to section\n387.8\n(a) of this\n\nPart must have prorated benefits for the initial month of application and\nbenefits for the month following the initial month of application made\navailable to them within the time period for expedited service set forth in\nsection\n387.8\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Part and at the same time. (b) Households which have completed the application, provided the verification\nrequired by section\n387.8\n(c) of this\n\nPart prior to the issuance of the expedited benefit, and have been determined\nto be eligible to receive benefits for the initial month of application and the\nmonth following the initial month of application, must have prorated benefits\nfor the initial month of application and the first full month's benefits made\navailable within the time period for expedited service set forth in section\n387.8\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Part and at the same time. (c) Households which have been determined to be eligible for expedited service\npursuant to section\n387.8\n(a) of this\n\nPart but have not provided the verification required by section\n387.8\n(c) of this\n\nPart, must have the prorated benefits made available as set forth in clause\n(\na\n) of this subparagraph. When the household provides the\nverification required by section\n387.8\n(c) of this\n\nPart and is determined to be eligible to receive benefits for the month\nfollowing the initial month of application, then the first full month of\nbenefits must be made available to the household within five working days\nfollowing the date the verification is completed or the first working day of\nthe following month, whichever is later. (iii)\n\nThe provisions of subparagraphs (i) and\n(ii) of this paragraph do not apply to households which have been determined\nnot to be eligible to receive benefits for the initial month of application or\nthe month following the initial month of application. Households which have\nbeen determined to be eligible for expedited service under section\n387.8\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Part must, however, receive benefits for the initial month of application\nand the month following the initial month of application under the verification\nstandards set forth in section\n387.8\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Part. In accordance with section\n387.15\n(f) of this\n\nPart, benefits of less than $10 are not to be issued under the provisions of\nsubparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph. (4)\n\nWhen a household's eligibility and\nopportunity to participate cannot be determined within 30 days of the filing\ndate of the application, the following actions shall be taken: (i) The cause of the delay shall be\ndetermined. (a) The cause of the delay shall\nbe considered the household's fault if the household has failed to complete the\napplication process and the local district has taken the following actions to\nassist the household: (1)\noffered to assist\nor has assisted the applicant in completing the application if the application\nform is incomplete; (2)\ninformed\nthe household of the need to register for work when any member who is required\nto register has not done so and has given the household at least 10 days from\nthe date of notification within which to register; (3)\nassisted the household in obtaining the\nrequired verification and documentation and allowed the household at least 10\ndays from the date of the initial request to provide such documentation; and\n(4)\nattempted to reschedule the\ninterview as required in section\n387.7\nof this Part if the\nhousehold has failed to appear at the initial interview. (b) Delays that are the fault of the local\ndepartment, including but not limited to those cases where the local district\nfailed to take the actions to assist the household described in clause\n(\na\n) of this subparagraph. (ii)\n\nIf by the 30th day, no further action\ncan be taken on an application due to the fault of the household, a notice of\ndenial must be sent to the household. However, if the household takes the\nrequired action within 60 days from the date the application was originally\nfiled, the case must be processed without requiring a new application. If the\nhousehold wishes to have the application processed during the second 30-day\nperiod, the notice of denial may include a request that the household report\nall changes in circumstances since the application was filed. After the notice\nof denial is sent, no further action by the local district is required if the\nhousehold fails to take the required action within 60 days of the application\nfiling date. If the household was at fault for the delay in the first 30-day\nperiod, but is found to be eligible during the second 30-day period, prorated\nbenefits must be provided to the household from the date the necessary\nverification was provided. (iii)\n\nIf\na delay in the initial 30-day period is the fault of the local district, the\nhousehold shall be notified by the 30th day after the application filing date\nthat the application is being held and the household shall be notified of any\nfurther action it must take to complete the application. If the household is\nfound to be eligible during the second 30-day period, prorated benefits must be\nprovided from the date of application. However, if the household is found to be\nineligible during the second 30-day period, the application shall be\ndenied. (iv)\n\nFor delays continuing\n60 days, the following applies: (a) When the\nsocial services district is at fault for not completing the application process\nby the end of the second 30-day period, it must continue to process the\napplication until an eligibility decision is reached. If the household is\ndetermined to be eligible and the social services district was at fault for the\ndelay in the initial 30 days, the household must receive benefits retroactive\nto the day of application. However, if the initial 30-day delay was the\nhousehold's fault, the household must receive benefits retroactively to the\ndate final verification of all required eligibility factors was received by the\nsocial services district. The original application may be used to process the\napplication in the months following the 60-day period, or the household may be\nrequired to file a new application. (b) When a household is at fault for not\ncompleting the application process by the end of the second 30-day period, the\napplication must be denied. The household is not entitled to any lost benefits, even if the delay in the initial 30 days was the fault of the social services\ndistrict. (5)\n\nCategorical eligibility. (i) Categorically\neligible households are exempted from the gross and net income limits as\ndefined in section\n387.10\nof this Part. Categorically\neligible households are presumed, without further investigation or\nverification, to meet the resource limits as set forth in section\n387.9\nof this Part as a result of\nall members of the household being eligible for family assistance, nonemergency\nsafety net assistance and/or SSI. Social security numbers, sponsored alien\ninformation and residency information as provided to establish and maintain\neligibility for family assistance, non-emergency safety net assistance and/or\nSSI are presumed to be correct, without further investigation or verification. All other requirements of SNAP eligibility and benefit levels apply to\ncategorically eligible households as specified in this Part. The following\nhouseholds shall be considered categorically eligible for SNAP: (a) households in which all members are\nrecipients of family assistance, nonemergency safety net assistance and/or SSI\nbenefits must be considered categorically eligible for SNAP. Categorically\neligible recipients include: (1)\nhouseholds\nin which all members are authorized to receive family assistance, nonemergency\nsafety net assistance and/or SSI benefits but who have not yet received\npayment; (2)\nindividuals whose\nfamily assistance, nonemergency safety net assistance and/or SSI benefits are\nsuspended or being recouped; and\n(3)\nindividuals determined eligible for\nfamily assistance or nonemergency safety net assistance benefits but who are\nnot paid such benefits because the grant is less than $10. (b) households that have either an elderly or\ndisabled member (or members) as defined in section\n387.1\nof this Part and a gross\nincome at or below 200 percent of the Federal poverty limit; (c) households that have out-of-pocket\ndependent care expenses and a gross income at or below 200 percent of the\n\nFederal poverty limit; (d) households that have earned income budgeted for the purpose of determining SNAP\neligibility and benefit amount and a total gross income at or below 150 percent\nof the Federal poverty limit; and\n(e) households not meeting one or more of the\ndefinitions set forth in clauses (\na\n) through\n(\nd\n) above with gross household income at or below 130 percent\nof the Federal poverty limit. (ii)\n\nUnder no circumstances can any household\nbe considered categorically eligible for SNAP if any member of that household\nis disqualified from participating in SNAP for: (a) an intentional program violation, as\ndefined by section\n387.1\nof this Part; (b) failure to comply with the periodic\nreporting requirements in accordance with section\n387.17\n(d) of this\n\nPart; or\n(c) failure to comply with\nthe work requirements in accordance with section\n385.3\nof this Title. (iii)\n\nIndividuals ineligible to\nparticipate in SNAP cannot be included in any household which is otherwise\ncategorically eligible for SNAP. Ineligible individuals include, but are not\nlimited to, the following: (a) aliens who do\nnot meet the citizenship or eligible alien status requirements contained in\nsection\n387.9\nof this Part or the eligible\nsponsored alien requirements contained in section\n387.10\n(b)(6)\nof\nthis Part; (b) individuals who do\nnot meet the definition of a student as contained in section\n387.1\nof this Part; (c) residents of commercial boarding\nhomes; (d) individuals living with\nothers and paying compensation to others for meals and lodging but not meeting\nthe requirements for such group living/shelter arrangements; (e) boarders, as defined in section\n387.1\nof this Part, unless the\nboarder participates as a member of the household providing services, including\nlodging and meals, at such household's request; or\n(f) individuals or groups of individuals who\nare residents of institutions except the following: (1)\nresidents of federally subsidized housing\nfor the elderly, built under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 or section\n236 of the National Housing Act; (2)\npersons with alcohol and/or substance use\ndisorders residing in public or approved nonprofit private drug or alcoholic\ntreatment centers or facilities, and children who live with their parent or\nparents in such drug or alcoholic treatment centers or facilities, which meet\nthe requirements of a drug addiction or alcoholic treatment and rehabilitation\nfacility as set forth in section\n387.1\nof this Part; (3)\nvisually impaired or otherwise disabled\nindividuals who reside in approved group living facilities and who because of\ntheir disabilities are in receipt of social security benefits under title II or\ntitle XVI of the Social Security Act; (4)\nwomen or women with their children who\nare residing in temporary shelters for battered women and children; and\n(5)\nhomeless individuals or\nfamilies who are categorically eligible as defined in this paragraph and who\nare residents of public or private nonprofit shelters for homeless persons. (b) Application for\nrecertification. In recertifying eligibility for food stamps, eligibility\nand the level of benefits shall be determined based on circumstances which are\nanticipated to exist for the certification period beginning with the month\nfollowing the expiration of the current certification period. (c) Anticipated changes in household\ncircumstances. Anticipated changes in the household's circumstances, as\nreviewed in the eligibility determination process, may indicate the eligibility\nof the household for food stamp benefits for the month of application even if\nthose benefits are not issued until the subsequent month; or a household may be\nineligible for the month of application but eligible in the subsequent month\ndue to a change in household circumstances. The same application shall be used\nfor the denial for the month of application and the determination of\neligibility for subsequent months pursuant to the standards set forth in this\n\nPart. (d) Determining\nresources. Resources, as described in section\n387.9\nof this Part, which are\navailable at the time the household is interviewed shall be used to determine\nthe household's eligibility. (e) Determining income. (1)\n\nIncome already received by the household\nduring the certification period and any income that can reasonably be\nanticipated during the remainder of the certification period shall be used in\ndetermining the household's eligibility and level of food stamp benefits. If\nthe amount of income that will be received, or when it will be received is\nuncertain, that portion of the household's income that is uncertain shall not\nbe counted as income. In situations where the receipt of the income is\nreasonably certain but the monthly amount may fluctuate, the household can\nelect to income-average in accordance with paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nIncome received\nduring the past 30 days shall be used as an indicator of the income that is and\nwill be available to the household during the certification period. In no event\nshall past income, seasonal or otherwise, automatically be attributed to the\nhousehold as an indicator of anticipated income when changes in income have\noccurred or can be anticipated during the certification period. (3)\n\nWages retained by an employer at the\nrequest of the employee shall be considered income to the household in the\nmonth the wages would otherwise have been paid by the employer. Wages retained\nby the employer as a general practice, even if in violation of law, shall not\nbe counted as income to the household unless the household anticipates that it\nwill ask for and receive an advance, or that it will receive income from wages\nthat were previously held by the employer and which were not previously counted\nas income. Advances of wages shall count as income in the month received only\nif their receipt is reasonably anticipated, as noted in this section. (4)\n\nHouseholds receiving public assistance\n(ADC and HR), SSI or social security payments or similar Federal and State\nbenefits on a recurring basis shall not have their monthly income from these\nsources varied for the purpose of calculating income in determining food stamp\nbenefits merely because mailing cycles may cause two payments to be received in\none month and none in the next month. (5)\n\nIncome-averaging. (i) Households, except destitute migrant\nhouseholds, and households subject to a monthly reporting requirement for\npublic assistance, may elect to have their income averaged. Income shall not be\naveraged for a destitute migrant household since averaging would result in\nassigning income to the month of application from future periods which is not\navailable for current food needs. The household's expectations regarding income\nfluctuations over the certification period shall be used in averaging income. The number of months used to arrive at the average income need not be the same\nas the number of months in the certification period. (ii)\n\nHouseholds which, by contract or\nself-employment, derive their annual income in a period of time which is less\nthan one year shall have that income averaged over a 12-month period, provided\nthe income from the contract is not received on an hourly or piecework basis. Such individuals may include members who are school employees, sharecroppers, farmers, and other self-employed persons. However, these provisions do not\napply to migrant or seasonal farm workers. (iii)\n\nHouseholds receiving scholarships, deferred educational loans, or other educational grants shall have such income, after exclusions, averaged over the period for which it was provided. (f) Treatment of\nincome and resources of disqualified members of the household. Individual household members may be disqualified from\nparticipating in the food stamp program because of failure to meet or comply\nwith program requirements as detailed in this Part. During the period of time\nthat such household members are disqualified, the eligibility and benefit\nlevels of any remaining household members must be determined in accordance with\nsection\n387.16\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (g) Determining\ndeductions. (1)\n\nOnly the specific\ndeductions set forth in section\n387.12\nof this Part are\napplicable. (i) Expenses shall only be\ndeducted if the service is provided by someone outside of the household and the\nhousehold pays for the service. (ii)\nA deduction shall be allowed only in the\nmonth the expense is billed or otherwise becomes due, regardless of when the\nhousehold intends to pay the expense. One-time-only expenses may be averaged\nover the entire certification period in which they are billed. Households\nreporting one-time-only medical expenses may elect to either a one-time\ndeduction or to have the expenses averaged over the remaining months of the\ncertification period. In addition, households with certification periods of\ngreater than 12 months may, at their option, choose to have the one-time only\nmedical expenses averaged over the remainder of the first 12 months of the\ncertification period. If the change is reported after the 12th month, it may be\nallowed either in one month or averaged over the remainder of the certification\nperiod. (iii)\n\nFluctuating expenses\nmay be averaged prospectively when used as a deduction. In addition, households\nwith certification periods of greater than 12 months may, at their option, choose to have the one-time only medical expenses averaged over the remainder\nof the first 12 months of the certification period. If the change is reported\nafter the 12th month, it may be allowed either in one month or averaged over\nthe remainder of the certification period. (iv)\nA household's expenses shall be\ncalculated based on the expenses the household expects to be billed for during\nthe certification period. Anticipation of the expense shall be based on the\nmost recent month's bills unless the household is reasonably certain a change\nwill occur. (h) Retrospective budgeting. Households subject to monthly reporting must be\nretrospectively budgeted. Retrospective budgeting\nis defined\nas a method by which income reported in a designated \"budget month\" is used to\ndetermine benefits in the month two months following the budget month, which\nwill be the household's corresponding \"issuance month.\"\n(1)\n\nInitial eligibility. Eligibility and the\ndetermination of a household's benefits shall be determined prospectively for\nthe first or \"beginning\" two months of participation in the food stamp program. However, a beginning month may not be any month which immediately follows a\nmonth in which a household is certified. Therefore, a food stamp household\nreapplying within one month of being terminated will continue to have their\nbenefits determined retrospectively and eligibility determined prospectively. If a public assistance food stamp case is determined to be eligible for food\nstamps for the month prior to the determination of the household's public\nassistance eligibility, the household's first three months shall be considered\nbeginning months. (2)\n\nOngoing\neligibility. Following a household's beginning months, the household shall\ncontinue to have its eligibility determined prospectively, but will have its\nongoing benefit level determined on a retrospective basis. (3)\n\nTreatment of income and deductions under\nretrospective budgeting. (i) Income. Local\ndepartments shall calculate a household's benefits using actual income from the\nbudget month, except the local department shall: (a) annualize and average self-employment\nincome as prescribed in this Part; (b) prorate income received by contract in\nless than one year over the period the income is to cover; and\n(c) prorate nonexcluded scholarships, deferred educational loans, and other educational income over the period they\nare intended to cover. (ii)\n\nShelter expenses. A household's reported\nshelter expenses shall be budgeted on a prospective basis. (iii)\n\nDependent care/medical deductions. A\nhousehold's medical and dependent care costs shall be budgeted retrospectively\nusing the household's medical and dependent care as of the budget\nmonth. (iv)\n\nTerminated source of\nincome. Income from any source of income which a household will no longer be\nreceiving following its beginning months shall be disregarded when determining\nthe household's ongoing benefit level which is being determined retrospective\nbudgeting; usually in determining a household's benefits for their third month\nof participation. In addition, any income from a source which has been\nterminated shall be disregarded when determining a household's budget level\nunder retrospective budgeting for the issuance month following the month in\nwhich the household informs the local department that the source has been\nterminated. (v) Gaining a household\nmember. When a household indicates in its processing month that it anticipates\ngaining a household member, that individual and his income shall be counted for\nboth eligibility and benefit calculation purpose for the issuance\nmonth. (vi)\n\nLosing a household\nmember. When a household indicates in its processing month that it anticipates\na household member is leaving prior to the issuance month, the local department\nshall not count either the person or his/her income for the issuance\nmonth. (vii)\n\nBudgeting public\nassistance grants. When determining the food stamp benefit level for a given\nissuance month, the amount of the public assistance grant to be considered as\nincome for that month shall be the amount of the public assistance grant that\nis to be issued; i.e., public assistance grants are budgeted\nprospectively for food stamps in the issuance month. Other income continues to\nbe budgeted retrospectively. (i) Child support pass-through\npayments. Child support pass-through payments to recipients of Aid\nto Dependent Children or Home Relief are budgeted, for purposes of determining\nfood stamp eligibility and benefit levels, on a one-month retrospective basis. Such payments are budgeted retrospectively for all households, including those\nhouseholds for which other income is budgeted\nprospectively. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
