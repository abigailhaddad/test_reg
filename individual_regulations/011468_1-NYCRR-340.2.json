  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 340.2 - Product specifications for labeling purposes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Authorization to establish\nspecifications. The commissioner is authorized to establish\nspecifications covering the principal constituents of any poultry food product\nwith respect to which a specified name of the product or other labeling\nterminology may be used, whenever such action is necessary to prevent sale of\nthe product under a false or deceptive name or other false or misleading\nlabeling. The requirements of this section are hereby found to be necessary for\nthis purpose. (b) Labeling terminology for light and dark chicken or turkey meat. Product containing light and dark chicken or turkey meat\nin quantities other than natural proportions, as indicated in table I, must\nhave a qualifying statement in close conjunction with the name of the product\nindicating, as shown in table I of this subdivision, the types of meat actually\nused, except that when the product contains less than 10 percent cooked deboned\npoultry meat or is processed in a manner that the character of the light and\ndark meat is not distinguishable, the qualifying statement will not be\nrequired. The qualifying statement must be in type at least one-half the size\nand of equal boldness as the name of the product; e.g., boned\nturkey (dark meat). If a product contains light and dark meat in natural\nproportions and bears a label referring to light or dark meat content, the\nlabel shall include a qualifying statement in accordance with this\nsubdivision.

(ii)\n\nIf, following cooking and cooling of\npoultry meat to be used in poultry food products, liquid or moisture is used in\ndirect contact with such poultry meat and the percentage of solids, excluding\nsalt, in the poultry meat is found to be below 34 percent when such poultry\nmeat is tested by approved methods, the percentage of poultry meat required by\nthis section for any poultry food product shall be increased in proportion to\nthe deficiency, or the meat shall be so processed as to raise the solids\ncontent, excluding salt, to 34 percent. The official plant shall furnish\nadequate facilities for such testing. (2)\n\nCanned boned poultry. (i) Canned boned poultry shall, unless\notherwise specified in this paragraph, be prepared from cooked deboned poultry\nmeat and may contain skin and fat not in excess of natural proportions.

Product within this subparagraph shall be prepared as set forth in table II, items 1, 2, 3, or 4, whichever is applicable.

TABLE IV\nProduct\nname\n1\n\nMinimum percent cooked deboned\npoultry meat of kind indicated\n\nMinimum percent cooked poultry of\nkind indicated, including bone\n(Kind) Ravioli\n2\n-\n(Kind) Soup\n2\n-\nChop Suey with (Kind)\n2\n-\n(Kind) Chop Suey\n4\n-\n(Kind) Chow Mein without noodles\n4\n-\n(Kind) Tamales\n6\n-\nNoodles or Dumplings with\n(Kind)\n2\n6\n-\n(Kind) Stew\n12\n-\n(Kind) Fricassee of Wings\n-\n40\n(Kind) Noodles or\n\nDumplings\n2\n15\n30\n\nCreamed (Kind)\n20\n-\n(Kind) Cacciatore\n20\n40\n(Kind) Fricassee\n20\n40\n(Kind) A-La-King\n20\n-\nSliced (Kind) with Gravy\n35\n-\nMinced (Kind) Barbecue\n40\n-\n(7)\n\nReady-to-cook poultry products to which\nsolutions are added. (i) Butter alone, or\nsolutions of poultry broth, poultry stock, water, or edible fats, or mixtures\nthereof, in which are included functional substances such as spices, flavor\nenhancers, emulsifiers, phosphates, coloring materials, or other substances, approved by the commissioner in specific cases, may be introduced by injection\ninto the thick muscles (breast and legs) of ready-to-cook poultry carcasses and\nmay be introduced by injection or marinating into any separate part therefrom\nand into poultry roasts including chunked and formed products (but not poultry\nrolls) for the purpose of providing a basting medium or similar function. The\ningredients of the added materials and the manner of addition to the products\nmust be found acceptable by the commissioner, in all cases. The introduction of\nthe added materials shall increase the weight of the processed product by\napproximately three percent over the weight of the raw product after washing\nand chilling in compliance with section 340.50. The provisions of subdivision\n(b) of this section specifying light and dark meat percentages required for\ncertain poultry products shall be construed to permit products under this\nparagraph to contain approximately three percent of the added materials as\nprovided in this paragraph under conditions outlined in subparagraph (iii) of\nthis paragraph; and the weight of the added materials introduced into the\npoultry products as provided in this paragraph shall be included as part of the\nweight of the poultry for purposes of the net weight labeling provisions in\nsection 340.130(a)(3). (ii)\nA raw\npoultry product, into which the added materials of the type described in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph are introduced, must be labeled with a\nconspicuous, legible, and descriptive name, including terms that describe the\nmethod of addition and function of the added material. All major terms in the\nproduct name must be printed with the same prominence, except that the words\nwhich concisely describe the function of the added materials (such as \"Injected\nfor Flavored Basting\") may be more prominent provided this does not detract\nfrom the conspicuousness of the other terms in the product name (such as \"Young\n\nTurkey\"). The label must bear a statement, in bold type, immediately below and\nadjacent to the product name, listing the common or usual names of the added\nmaterials in descending order of predominance. The first part of this statement\nmust consist of terms adequate to inform consumers about the amount and manner\nof introduction of the solution (such as \"Injected with approximately three\npercent of a solution of __\"), and must be printed at least one-fourth the size\nof the most prominent letter in the product name with a minimum size of\none-fourth inch for a ready-to-cook turkey and proportionately smaller for\nother poultry products. The remainder of the solution ingredients shall be\ndeclared in type at least one-eighth inch in height. The entire statement must\nbe printed in a color that contrasts with the background and be displayed on\nthe principal display panel. (iii)\n\nApproval for use of a label for product under this paragraph depends upon the\nability of the processor to control the finished product so that the average\npercent of basting material in each outgoing lot varies no more than 10 percent\nfrom the three percent requirement. Therefore, lots averaging 2.7 percent to\n3.3 percent of basting material when tested by an approved plant control\nprocedure would be in compliance. As used in this subparagraph, \"a lot\" may be\nany reasonable portion of production designated by the official plant, or a\nmaximum of an entire shift's production from one production line. The control\nprocedures to be eligible for approval by the commissioner must: (a) Assure compliance with all labeling\nrequirements. (b) Control the\nvariability of the three percent added approved solution within the limits\ndefined above. (c) Provide for the\ndisposition in accordance with the regulations in this Part of all products not\nin compliance with this Part, unless they are reprocessed to bring them into\nsuch compliance. (d) Incorporate a\nsystem of raw weight identification of a sufficient number of poultry and/or\npoultry parts to allow effective monitoring of the system by department\ninspectors and plant employees. Footnotes\n1\n\nThe product name may contain other appropriate\ndescriptive terms such as \"noodle\"; e.g., \"Chicken Noodle\n\nSoup\". 2 Product also includes rice or similar\nstarches. Notes\nN.Y.
