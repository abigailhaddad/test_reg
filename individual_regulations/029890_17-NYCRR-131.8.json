  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 131.8 - Accommodation of utilities on highways with no control of access\n\nState Regulations\n\nConsistent with any franchised right or privilege granted\nby any statute, public, private, municipal and State utility facilities will be\npermitted to cross or occupy the rights-of-way of highways with no control of\naccess in accordance with nationally recognized standards and the provisions of\nthis Part. In case of conflict, the provisions of this Part shall govern. In\nsituations where unusual conditions or considerations are present that\njeopardize highway safety or highway operation or maintenance, the department\nmay impose additional construction or placement requirements reasonably\nnecessary for such condition. In any case where a permit, fee, rental, or a use\nand occupancy agreement is required, such must be paid, or be in effect, prior\nto entry upon the rights-of-way. (a) On highways where posted speeds are greater than 35 mph: (1)\n\nAll new or relocated above-ground utility\nelements shall be located as near as possible to the rights-of-way line, and\nnot within the appropriate clear zone, deflection zone or area or the runout\narea of guiderail systems. The department may consider exceptions where it is\nnot reasonably possible to achieve the appropriate clear zone, upon showing\nthat highway safety is not impaired, and the maintenance and operation of the\nhighway are not adversely affected. The public or private utility, shall\nreimburse the department for additional expenses attributable to any such\nexception, including, but not limited to any costs and expenses attributable to\nthe installation of guiderail or upgrading a guiderail system. (2)\n\nAll new or relocated underground\nfacilities shall be placed adjacent to the rights-of-way line whenever\nreasonably possible. Each type of facility shall be properly separated. Where\nit is not feasible to locate underground elements near the rights-of-way line, elements may be located in the area between the ditch or slope line and\nrights-of-way line, or between the outer edge of shoulder or curb and\nrights-of-way line. However, such must always be outside the drainage system, unless the facility is crossing the right-of-way, and/or, unless unusual\nphysical conditions are present, and the department grants an\nexception. (b) On\nhighways with posted speeds of 35 mph or less: (1)\n\nAll new or relocated installations of\nabove-ground utility elements shall be located in accordance with the\nfollowing, in order of preference, but not within the clear zone: (i) at the rights-of-way line; (ii)\nbetween the outer edge of the sidewalk\nand the rights of-way line; (iii)\na\nminimum of one foot six inches behind the face of curb or edge of shoulder\n(where appropriate). Placement within usable sidewalk width is to be avoided. In no case shall this placement reduce the open width of a sidewalk to less\nthan 36 inches; (iv)\nif such one\nfoot six inch minimum offset cannot be physically attained, a lesser\nappropriate distance behind the face of curb may be considered and/or\nauthorized by the department and, where applicable, the Federal Highway\n\nAdministration. (2)\n\nAll\nnew or relocated longitudinal installations of underground elements shall be\nlocated in accordance with the following in order of preference: (i) between the outer edge of sidewalk and\nthe rights-of-way line; (ii)\nunderneath the sidewalk; (iii)\nbetween the curb and sidewalk; (iv)\nunderneath the roadway pavement of a parking lane; (v) underneath the roadway pavement, only if\nother locations are neither feasible nor practicable, and only if the\ndepartment after examination finds that the safety and integrity of the highway\ntraffic operations and highway maintenance will not be jeopardized by the\ninstallation and subsequent maintenance of the utility.
