  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.32 - Executive Order No. 32: [Establishing Breast Cancer Advisory Committee.]\nState Regulations\n\nBreast cancer is a major public health problem that\nwarrants the most serious efforts by the State to reduce its ravages. It is the\nleading cause of death among women age 40 to 44, reaching almost epidemic\nproportions in recent years. The mortality of breast cancer can be dramatically\nreduced if the disease is detected at its initial stage. Therefore, an\naggressive and comprehensive program of breast cancer detection is critically\nimportant. The means for treating this serious problem may be at hand\nthrough improved techniques of early detection and new methods of treatment. Programs for detection, however, are rarely properly organized or coordinated\nwith the essential treatment and follow-up services. Therefore, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of New\n\nYork, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws of\nthe State of New York, in order to insure that the State assume a leadership\nrole in coordinating the diverse public and private efforts in the fight\nagainst breast cancer, and in order to provide the best possible information\nconcerning proper modes of prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and follow-up care\nfor breast cancer to the people of New York, do hereby direct the Commissioner\nof Health to develop a statewide comprehensive plan for an early detection\nsystem for breast cancer. To advise and assist the Commissioner of Health in the\nacquisition of relevant data and in the preparation and implementation of the\nstatewide comprehensive plan, I hereby establish a Breast Cancer Advisory\n\nCommittee, to consist of 16 members appointed by the Governor and to be\ncomprised of recognized experts in the fields of medicine, health economics, education and public health for breast cancer control programs, as well as\nprivate individuals widely experienced in the fight against breast\ncancer. The Committee shall solicit and interpret data from\nrecognized breast cancer screening centers and other breast cancer authorities\nand shall advise the Commissioner of Health on the development, implementation\nand policy direction of the statewide comprehensive plan. The Commissioner of Health shall be responsible for\ncollecting and analyzing data, formulating standards and guidelines, conducting\nsuch studies as are advisable and organizing and coordinating the diverse\nprivate and public resource expenditures for the purpose of early detection. The plan he derives must identify a statewide early detection system which will\nbe interrelated with the health system's treatment resources for appropriate\nfollow-up and case management as well as for general educational\npurposes. The Commissioner of Health is hereby directed to submit to\nthe Governor a statewide comprehensive plan for the early detection and\ntreatment of breast cancer. He is directed to make periodic progress reports on\nthe development of this plan at three-month intervals from the date of this\n\nOrder and to submit progress reports on implementation of the plan at six-month\nintervals from the date of its submission. Signed: Hugh L. Carey\n\nDated: March 10, 1976\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n3.32\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
