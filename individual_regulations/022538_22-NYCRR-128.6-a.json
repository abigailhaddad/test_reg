  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 128.6-a - Postponement and excusal from jury service\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Postponement. (1)\nA prospective juror who\nhas received the initial jury summons is entitled, upon notifying the\ncommissioner of jurors, to a postponement of jury service to a specific jury\nterm date that is not more than six months after the date such service is to\ncommence as set forth in the summons. The prospective juror may notify the\ncommissioner by telephone that he or she is seeking such postponement and shall\nselect an appropriate date to which service is to be postponed. A request for\npostponement shall be made at such time as the commissioner shall require. The\ncommissioner, in his or her discretion, may grant a postponement of jury\nservice for greater than six months, but only upon good cause shown. (2)\n\nThe commissioner may grant\na prospective juror's subsequent request for a postponement of jury service, but only upon a written application, containing documentation acceptable to the\ncommissioner, showing that an inability to obtain a postponement would result\nin a hardship that was unanticipated at the time of the prior postponement. Absent extraordinary circumstances, the commissioner shall not grant a\nprospective juror more than three postponements of jury service, nor shall the\naggregate period of postponements granted to a prospective juror exceed 18\nmonths. (b) Excusal. (1)\nA prospective juror who has\nreceived a jury summons may apply to be excused from jury service by submitting\na written application for excusal to the commissioner, at such time as the\ncommissioner shall require. Such application for excusal may be granted only if\nthe prospective juror has demonstrated satisfactorily that: (i) he or she has a mental or\nphysical condition that renders him or her incapable of performing jury\nservice, or that jury service would cause undue hardship or extreme\ninconvenience to the prospective juror, a person under his or her care or\nsupervision, or the public; and\n(ii)\nhe or she will be unable to serve\nas a juror on a date certain within the time restrictions applicable to\npostponements set forth in subdivision (a) of this section. The application shall contain\ndocumentation, satisfactory to the commissioner, supporting the ground for\nexcusal. The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, consider an\napplication for excusal by a prospective juror before the juror has received a\njury summons if the juror has returned the juror qualification\nquestionnaire. (2)\n\nIf the application for excusal is\ngranted and the facts underlying the ground for the excusal are not of a\npermanent nature, the excusal shall be for a specific period of time not to\nexceed 24 months or, in extraordinary cases, beyond 24 months, after which the\nprospective juror shall become eligible for re-qualification as a juror. If the\nfacts underlying the ground for excusal are of a permanent nature, the excusal\nshall be permanent. (c) Recordkeeping. The commissioner of\njurors shall maintain a list of the names of persons excused or postponed from\nservice as a trial juror, with an indication of the reasons therefor insofar as\npracticable, and which shall include the time periods for which the persons\nhave been postponed or excused. A judge hearing an application for postponement\nor excusal shall provide notice of his or her determination expeditiously to\nthe commissioner of jurors for inclusion in such records. (d) Guidelines. The\ncommissioner or jurors shall conform to such guidelines as may be promulgated\nby the Chief Administrator of the Courts in determining whether to grant\npostponements and excusals from jury service. Guidelines for Postponements and\n\nExcusals\n\nJudges and Commissioners of Jurors shall\nutilize the following guidelines in determining whether to grant postponements\nand excusals from jury service pursuant to section\n517\nof the\n\nJudiciary Law. I. Definitions\n1. \"Postponement\"\n- A \"postponement\" of jury service is an adjournment of the date of jury\nservice to a subsequent fixed date. These guidelines shall apply only to\npostponements of between six and 18 months from the date set forth in the\ninitial juror summons. Postponements of up to six months from the initial\nsummons are not covered by these guidelines, because those postponements must\nbe granted at the request of the person summoned; postponements of greater than\n18 months are not permitted by court rules. 2. \"Excusal\" - An \"excusal\" from jury\nservice is the canceling of a juror summons for a period not to exceed 24\nmonths, after which the person so summoned again shall become eligible for\nrequalification as a juror. An excusal may be granted only where jury service\ncannot be postponed. A person may receive a permanent excusal, and be excluded\nfrom selection from any list of prospective jurors, where the judge or\n\nCommissioner of Jurors determines that the underlying ground for the excusal is\nof a permanent nature. II. Standards\n\nJudges and Commissioners of Jurors shall\nbe guided by the following standards in determining whether a person shall\nreceive a postponement of or excusal from jury service. Nothing in these\nguidelines shall be deemed to limit the documentation that a judge or\n\nCommissioner of Jurors may require based upon the facts underlying any\nindividual application for postponement or excusal. A judge or Commissioner of\n\nJurors, in appropriate cases, also may require that any statement submitted be\nsworn to under oath. A. Mental or Physical Capacity\n\nAn application for postponement or excusal\nmay be granted if the applicant has a mental or physical condition that causes\nhim or her to be incapable of performing jury service. The judge or\n\nCommissioner of Jurors may require the following documentation in support of\nthe application: 1. A\nstatement signed by an appropriately licensed health care provider, setting\nforth (i) a diagnosis of the mental or physical condition of the applicant, (ii) a prognosis of the length of time the mental or physical condition is\nexpected to continue to exist, and (iii) a conclusion that the applicant is not\ncapable of performing jury service. 2. A statement from the applicant\ndescribing the physical or mental condition and setting forth why the applicant\nbelieves the condition prevents his or her service as a juror and when the\napplicant believes that he or she will become capable to serve as a juror. The\napplicant may be required to provide documentation concerning his or her\nemployment status. If the applicant describes a condition associated with\nadvanced age, he or she may be required to provide documentation of his or her\nage. B. Undue hardship or extreme inconvenience\n\nAn application for postponement or excusal\nmay be granted if service as a juror would cause undue hardship or extreme\ninconvenience to the applicant, a person under his or her care or supervision, or the public. A determination of undue hardship or extreme inconvenience shall\nbe based upon service as a juror for a period of five consecutive court\ndays. 1. Caregivers\n\nAn applicant may obtain a postponement or\nexcusal if the applicant (i) has a personal obligation to care for another, including a sick, aged, infirm or disabled dependent or a minor child, who\nrequires the prospective juror's personal care and attention during the time\nthe person will be required to serve as a juror, and (ii) no alternative care\nis available without severe financial hardship to the applicant or the person\nrequiring care, or because special needs of the person receiving care foreclose\nthe temporary substitution of another caregiver. In determining whether the\napplicant's personal care and attention are required, the judge or Commissioner\nof Jurors may require the following documentation in support of the\napplication: a. A copy\nof a birth certificate of a minor child; b. A statement signed by an\nappropriately licensed health care provider describing the medical condition of\nan aged, sick, infirm or disabled person; c. A statement by the applicant that he\nor she is the primary caregiver and setting forth (i) the circumstances\nnecessitating the caregiving services of the applicant, (ii) the hours that the\napplicant provides such care and (iii) the reasons why the applicant cannot\nmake arrrangements for care to be provided by another during the period of jury\nservice; and d. Documentation veryifying any employment of the applicant, including hours worked and salary earned. 2. Financial hardship\n\nAn applicant may obtain a postponement or\nexcusal if the applicant will suffer a financial hardship that will\nsignificantly compromise the applicant's ability to support himself, herself or\ndependents. In determining whether the applicant's ability to provide such\nsupport is significantly compromised, the court or Commissioner of Jurors may\nrequire the following documentation: a. A statement from the applicant\nsetting forth (i) the applicant's sources of income, (ii) the applicant's hours\nof work, (iii) the amount of money that would be lost as a result of jury\nservice, and (iv) the impact that this loss will have on (A) the applicant's\nability to provide support to the applicant and his or her dependents and (B)\nwhere appropriate, the ability of the applicant to maintain his or her\nbusiness. b. Forms\nfiled with governmental taxing authorities showing the financial status of the\napplicant and, where relevant, of his or her business. 3. Needs of the public\n\nAn applicant may obtain a postponement or\nexcusal if his or her absence to serve as a juror would jeopardize to a\nsignificant degree the health, welfare or safety of the public. In determining\nwhether the health, welfare or safety of the public would be significantly\njeorpardized, the judge or Commissioner of Jurors may require a statement by\nthe applicant setting forth (i) the nature and duties of his or her service to\nthe public, (ii) the hours when such service is performed, and (iii) the\navailability of others to perform such service in his or her absence. The\nperformance of duities that affect the public shall not by itself serve as a\nground for postponement or excusal without a showing that the specific\nindividual services performed by the applicant meet the criteria contianed in\nthese guidelines. 4. Lack of transportation\n\nAn applicant may obtain a postponement or\nexcusal if (i) the applicant does not have access to a private vehicle, (ii)\nthere is no available public transportation that will permit the applicant to\ntravel to the court in a reasonable time, and (iii) use of other alternate\nmeans of transportation to the court would create a severe financial burden. In\ndetermining whether an applicant lacks transportation to appear in court to\nserve as a juror, the judge or Comissioner of Jurors may require a statement by\nthe applicant setting forth (i) the reasons the applicant cannot obtain\ntransportation to the court, (ii) the applicant's current employment status and\ntransportation arrangements to his or her place of employment, and (iii) the\nanticipated duration of the applicant's inability to obtain the necessary\ntransportation. C. Matters of conscience\n\nApplications for excusal from jury service\nbased upon matters of conscience should be handled during jury selection or\ndetermined by the trial judge. Members of the clergy who request excusal\nfor matters of conscience shall be excused by the Commissioner of Jurors, unless determined otherwise by the court, and removed from the current list of\nqualified jurors. In support of each request, the following documentation shall\nbe submitted tot he Commissioner of Jurors: (1)\na written statement by the\napplicant identifying the religious beliefs on which the request is based; and\n(2)\na written\nstatement by the head of the religious organization or authorized designee\nsupporting the request.
