Tit. 9 § 4.142 - Executive order no. 142: establishing new waste reduction and recycling initiatives for state agencies\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, waste reduction and recycling are the highest\npriorities for solid waste management in New York State; WHEREAS, increasing pressures upon New York State's solid\nwaste disposal capacity require cooperation by all New Yorkers to reduce our\ndependence on landfills and other disposal facilities; WHEREAS, the Solid Waste Management Act of 1988, Chapter 70\nof the Laws of 1988, requires all State agencies to institute a program to\nsource separate waste paper generated within state facilities by July 1, 1989, and to source separate by July 1, 1990, all other wastes generated within such\nfacilities for which the full avoided costs of proper collection, transportation and disposal of source separated material are equal to or\ngreater than the cost of collection, transportation and sale of the recovered\nmaterial less the amount received from the sale of such material; WHEREAS, the Solid Waste Management Act of 1988 also\nrequires all public authorities, corporations, and commissions to source\nseparate waste paper by July 1, 1990, and requires such public authorities, corporations, and commissions by July 1, 1991, to source separate all other\nwastes generated within their facilities for which the full avoided costs of\nproper collection, transportation and disposal of source separated material are\nequal to or greater than the cost of collection, transportation and sale of the\nrecovered material less the amount received from the sale of such\nmaterial; WHEREAS, the purchase of recycled products is necessary to\nensure a market for source separated materials, and State agencies are a major\npurchaser of products; WHEREAS, government must operate as an example to all New\n\nYorkers that waste reduction and recycling are essential elements of natural\nresource conservation and of the State's integrated solid waste management\nprogram; NOW, THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws of the\n\nState of New York, do hereby direct all State agencies to undertake those\nefforts necessary to maximize all opportunities to reduce the amount of solid\nwaste generated, to recycle material recoverable from the solid waste\noriginating at their facilities, and to maximize the procurement of recycled\nproducts. I. PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES\nThe purpose of this Order is to establish a program which\nwill strengthen the State's commitment to waste reduction and recycling through\nincreased effort at all State facilities to reduce waste generation, to source\nseparate recyclable materials from the workplace wastestream, and to maximize\nthe procurement of recycled products. Toward that end, New York State agencies shall institute\nthe following practices. -- All State agencies not presently obligated to institute\nsource separation programs shall, no later than April 1, 1991, institute a\nprogram to source separate waste paper generated within their facilities, regardless of whether such facilities are owned by the State or are buildings\nleased and operated by the State, and such source separation programs shall be\nincluded in all new and renewed leases entered into by the State where\nfeasible. -- All State agencies not presently obligated to institute\nsource separation programs shall, no later than January 1, 1992, institute a\nprogram to source separate all other wastes generated within their facilities, regardless of whether such facilities are owned by the State or are buildings\nleased and operated by the State, and such source separation programs shall be\nincluded in all new and renewed leases entered into by the State where\nfeasible. -- All State agencies obligated to institute source\nseparation programs shall, through employee education and installation of\nnecessary equipment, maximize their source separation programs for waste paper\nand all other wastes generated within their facilities, regardless of whether\nsuch facilities are owned by the State or are buildings leased and operated by\nthe State, and such source separation programs shall be included in all new and\nrenewed leases entered into by the State where feasible. -- All State agencies shall use recycled paper for\nletterhead and other paper uses unless the Office of General Services (OGS)\ndetermines that recycled product is not available, is inadequate for the\npurpose intended, or that the cost of the recycled paper exceeds the cost of\nthe non-recycled paper by more than ten percent. -- All State agencies shall, consistent with applicable\nlaw, purchase recycled products made from secondary materials, other than paper\nproducts, unless the purchasing agency determines that no recycled product is\navailable, or is inadequate for the purpose intended, or that the cost of the\nrecycled product is not competitive. State agencies shall, if permitted by law, purchase recycled products displaying the New York State recycling emblem, when\nadopted. Recycled product shall mean any product which has been manufactured\nfrom secondary materials as defined in subdivision one of section\ntwo hundred\nsixty-one\nof the Economic Development Law. -- Upon adoption by the Coalition of Northeastern Governors\n(CONEG) Source Reduction Council of a program for industry implementation of\npreferred packaging guidelines, all State agencies, wherever permitted by law\nand where feasible, shall purchase products marketed in conformance with such\nguidelines. -- All State agencies shall use locally available compost, mulch and soil amendments produced from secondary materials, as defined by the\n\nEconomic Development Law, provided the products meet State specifications, comply with all applicable regulations, comply with Department of Environmental\n\nConservation (DEC) requirements for use and are available at no cost or a\nreasonably competitive price. -- All State agencies shall undertake waste reduction and\nminimization efforts, which shall, at a minimum, include the use of \"two-way\"\nenvelopes and the purchase and use of double-sided copying equipment and other\nefforts to encourage double-sided copying where reasonable. -- The Department of Economic Development (DED) and the DEC\nshall establish a Task Force with the dry-cell battery manufacturers to develop\na plan for reducing the toxicity of such batteries and for developing methods\nand policies to achieve recovery of the batteries and the recycling thereof. DED and DEC, in consultation with the Department of Health (DOH), shall\nprepare, no later than January 1, 1993, a final plan regarding dry cell\nbatteries toxicity reduction and recycling. The plan shall include a schedule\nfor the development of collection systems capable of providing for the return\nof all dry-cell batteries sold in New York State by no later than January 1, 1995, and procedures for reducing, to the maximum extent practicable, dry-cell\nbatteries as wastes by no later than January 1, 2000. -- The Department of Transportation (DOT) shall undertake\nefforts including research and consultation with DEC and DED to address any\ntechnical or economic impediments to the use of recycled glass, rubber and\nother materials as components in paving materials and shall identify measures\nto overcome such impediments. -- The Department of Economic Development shall work\njointly with DOT and industries toward developing within the State supply\nsources of recycled materials for use as components of paving materials which\nmeet specifications as established pursuant to this Order. In addition, DED\nshall prepare a report, in consultation with DEC, that outlines the issues and\nquantifies the avoided costs in connection with the use of recycled materials\nas components of paving materials. Such report shall be completed by September\n1, 1991. -- The Department of Transportation shall establish, no\nlater than July 1, 1991, specifications and engineering guidelines for the\nbeneficial use of recycled glass and rubber as components in paving materials\nfor road construction. Such specifications and guidelines shall be developed\nafter consultation with DED, DEC and DOH and shall be approved by OGS.
