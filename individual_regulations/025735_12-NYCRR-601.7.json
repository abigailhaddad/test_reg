  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 601.7 - Approaches to skill attainment and training\n\nState Regulations\n(a) There are three approaches to determine\nthe progression of an apprentice through a program. They are: (1)\nthe time-based approach; (2)\nthe competency-based approach; and\n(3)\nthe hybrid\napproach. (b) The\napproach taken is specific to the program. The determination of the approach is\nmade by the sponsor, subject to approval by the commissioner that the approach\nis appropriate to the trade for which the program is registered. A program can\nutilize only one approach at a time, may not change approaches without\ndepartment approval, and may not change its approach while on\nprobation. (c) Time-based approach. (1)\n\nSponsor documentation for purposes of\nestablishing such a program shall include statements setting forth: (i) the term (length) of the\nprogram; (ii)\nthe work processes in\nwhich the apprentice will receive supervised work experience and training\non-the-job and the allocation of the approximate amount of time to be spent\nlearning each skill; (iii)\nan\noutline of the topics to be covered in related and supplemental instruction; and\n(iv)\nthe apprentice probation\nperiod, in months. (2)\n\nDocumentation required for purposes of authenticating an apprentice's progress\nin attaining the skills and knowledge of the trade shall include, but not be\nlimited to: (i) a blue book or approved\nalternative; and\n(ii)\ncopies of\ntranscripts of classes taken from related and supplemental instruction\nproviders, or documentation of in-house instruction including but not limited\nto attendance records, class instruction outlines, and copies of\ntests. (d) Competency-based approach. (1)\n\nApprentices in\ncompetency-based programs shall participate in on-the-job training and related\nand supplemental instruction until they have demonstrated a competency for each\nskill in the work process and each topic on the related instruction\noutline. (2)\n\nSponsor documentation\nfor purposes of establishing such a program shall include statements setting\nforth: (i) the term of the program (the term\nis determined by the length of an equivalent time-based program in the same\ntrade); (ii)\nan outline of the work\nprocesses in which the apprentice will receive supervised work experience and\non-the-job training, which shall identify each of the competencies to be\nmastered; (iii)\nan outline of the\ntopics to be covered in related and supplemental instruction; (iv)\nthe identification of a nationally and\nindustry recognized means of testing and evaluation to measure knowledge and\nproficiency in each of the required competencies, as well as a qualified, independent, third-party provider that will do the testing, including: (a) a description of the written proficiency\nmeasurement instrument(s) to be used; and\n(b) a description of the hands-on proficiency\nmeasurement instrument(s) to be used; (v) a description of the controlled learning\nenvironment in which the proficiency measurement instruments will be\nadministered; and\n(vi)\nthe\napprentice probation period, in months. (3)\n\nCompetency shall be demonstrated by both\nappropriate written and hands-on proficiency measurements. Administration of\nthese measurements shall be at the sponsor's expense. (4)\n\nDocumentation for purposes of\nauthenticating an apprentice's progress in attaining the skills and knowledge\nof the trade shall include, but not be limited to: (i) identifying the written proficiency\nmeasurement instrument used; (ii)\nidentifying the hands-on proficiency measurement instrument used; (iii)\nidentifying the controlled learning\nenvironment in which the instruments were administered; (iv)\nidentifying the third-party expert(s)\nwho conducted the hands-on evaluation of skills, and detailing his/her\nqualifications; (v) identifying the\nthird-party proctor(s) who administered any written examinations, including\nhis/her qualifications; (vi)\nthe\nresults on both the written and hands-on measurements of the apprentice's\ncompetencies, including a detailed description of each apprentice's individual, hands-on, competency evaluation; and\n(vii)\ndocumentation that demonstrates that\nthe apprentice has engaged in at least 1,000 hours of on-the-job\ntraining. (e) Hybrid approach. (1)\n\nThe hybrid approach is a\ncompetency-based program that also requires a minimum number of hours of\non-the-job training to be spent in the attainment of each skill prior to\ntesting. (2)\n\nSponsor documentation\nfor purposes of establishing such a program shall include all the documentation\nrequirements for a competency-based program plus a training outline that\ndelineates the minimum hourly requirements for completion of each\nskill. (3)\n\nDocumentation required\nfor purposes of authenticating what an apprentice has accomplished shall\ninclude, but not be limited to: (i) all the\ndocumentation requirements for a competency-based program; (ii)\na blue book or an approved alternative; and\n(iii)\nrelated and supplemental\ninstruction attendance records.
