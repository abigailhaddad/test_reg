  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2524.4 - Grounds for refusal to renew lease, or in hotels, discontinuing a hotel tenancy, without order of the DHCR\nState Regulations\n\nThe owner shall not be required to offer a renewal lease\nto a tenant, or in hotels, to continue a hotel tenancy, and may commence an\naction or proceeding to recover possession in a court of competent\njurisdiction, upon the expiration of the existing lease term, if any, after\nserving the tenant with a notice as required pursuant to section\n2524.2\nof this Part, only on one or\nmore of the following grounds: (a) Occupancy by owner or member of owner's immediate family. (1)\n\nAn owner who seeks to recover possession\nof a housing accommodation because of immediate and compelling necessity for\nsuch owner's personal use and occupancy as his or her primary residence in the\n\nCity of New York and/or for the use and occupancy of a member of his or her\nimmediate family as his or her primary residence in the City of New York, except that tenants in a noneviction conversion plan pursuant to section\n352-eeee\nof the General Business Law\nmay not be evicted on this ground on or after the date the conversion plan is\ndeclared effective. (2)\n\nThe\nprovisions of this subdivision shall not apply where a tenant or the spouse of\na tenant lawfully occupying the dwelling unit is sixty-two years of age or\nolder, or has been a tenant in a dwelling unit in that building for fifteen\nyears or more, or has an impairment which results from anatomical, physiological or psychological conditions, other than addiction to alcohol, gambling, or any controlled substance, which are demonstrable by medically\nacceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques, and which are\nexpected to be permanent and which prevent the tenant from engaging in any\nsubstantial gainful employment, unless the owner offers to provide and, if\nrequested, provides an equivalent or superior housing accommodation at the same\nor lower regulated rent in a closely proximate area. (3)\n\nAn owner may recover only one rent\nstabilized or rent controlled housing accommodation, whether for his or her\npersonal use and occupancy or that of his immediate family. The provisions of\nthis subdivision shall only permit one of the individual owners of any\nbuilding, whether such ownership is by joint tenancy, tenancy in common, or\ntenancy by the entirety to recover possession of one dwelling unit for personal\nuse and occupancy. (4)\n\nNo action or\nproceeding to recover possession pursuant to this subdivision shall be\ncommenced in a court of competent jurisdiction unless the owner shall have\nserved the tenant with a termination notice in accordance with subdivisions\n(a), (b) and (c)(3) of section\n2524.2\nof this Part. (5)\n\nThe failure of the owner to utilize the\nhousing accommodation for the purpose intended after the tenant vacates, or to\ncontinue in occupancy for a period of three years, may result in a forfeiture\nof the right to any increases in the legal regulated rent in the building in\nwhich such housing accommodation is contained for a period of three years, unless the owner offers and the tenant accepts re-occupancy of such housing\naccommodation on the same terms and conditions as existed at the time the\ntenant vacated, or the owner establishes to the satisfaction of the DHCR that\ncircumstances changed after the tenant vacated which prevented the owner from\nutilizing the housing accommodation for the purpose intended, and in such\nevent, the housing accommodation may be rented at the appropriate guidelines\nwithout a vacancy allowance. This paragraph shall not eliminate or create any\nclaim that the former tenant of the housing accommodation may or may not have\nagainst the owner. (b) Recovery by a not-for-profit institution. (1)\n\nThe owner is a hospital, convent, monastery, asylum, public institution, college, school dormitory, or any institution operated exclusively for\ncharitable or educational purposes on a nonprofit basis, and the owner, upon\nnotice to the tenant in accordance with section\n2524.2\n(c)(4)\nof\nthis Part, requires the housing accommodation for its own use in connection\nwith its charitable or educational purposes, and either: (i) the tenant's initial tenancy commenced\nafter the owner acquired the property, and the owner requires the housing\naccommodation in connection with its charitable or educational purposes, including but not limited to housing for affiliated persons; provided that the\nowner may not refuse to renew the lease of a tenant whose right to occupancy\ncommenced prior to July 1, 1978 pursuant to a written lease or written rental\nagreement, and who did not receive notice at the time of the execution of the\nlease that the tenancy was subject to nonrenewal; provided further that a\ntenant who was affiliated with the owning institution at the commencement of\nhis or her tenancy and whose affiliation terminates during such tenancy shall\nnot have the right to a renewal lease; or\n(ii)\nthe owner requires the housing\naccommodation for a nonresidential use in connection with its charitable or\neducational purposes. (2)\n\nIn addition to such penalty provided in\nsection\n2526.2\nof this Title, the failure\nof the owner without good cause to utilize or to continue to use the housing\naccommodation for the purpose intended after the tenant vacates, and for three\nyears thereafter, shall result in a forfeiture of the right to any increases in\nthe legal regulated rent for the housing accommodation involved for a\nthree-year period following the recovery of the housing accommodation from the\ntenant. (3)\n\nIf an owner who\nrecovers a housing accommodation pursuant to this subdivision, or any successor\nin interest, within three-years after recovery of the housing accommodation\nfrom the tenant, utilizes such housing accommodation for purposes other than\nthose permitted hereunder without good cause, then such owner or successor\nshall be liable to the removed tenant for three times the damages sustained on\naccount of such removal, plus reasonable attorney's fees and costs as\ndetermined by a court of competent jurisdiction, provided that such tenant\ncommences an action to recover such damages within three years from the date of\nrecovery of the housing accommodation. The damages sustained by such tenant\nshall be the difference between the rent paid by such tenant for the recovered\nhousing accommodation, and the rental value of a comparable rent-regulated\nhousing accommodation, plus the reasonable costs of the removal of the tenant's\nproperty. (c) Primary\nresidence. The housing accommodation is not occupied by the tenant, not\nincluding subtenants or occupants, as his or her primary residence, as\ndetermined by a court of competent jurisdiction; provided, however, that no\naction or proceeding shall be commenced seeking to recover possession on the\nground that the housing accommodation is not occupied by the tenant as his or\nher primary residence unless the owner or lessor shall have given 30 days'\nnotice to the tenant of his or her intention to commence such action or\nproceeding on such grounds. Such notice may be combined with the notice\nrequired by section\n2524.2\n(c)(2)\nof\nthis Title. A tenant who is a victim of domestic violence, as defined in\nsection\nfour hundred\nfifty-nine-a\nof the social services law, who has left\nthe unit because of such violence, and who asserts an intent to return to the\nhousing accommodation shall be deemed to be occupying the unit as his or her\nprimary residence. In addition, a tenant who has left the housing accommodation\nand is paying a nominal rent pursuant to Part 2520.11(e)(6) of this Title shall\nbe deemed to be occupying the unit as his or her primary residence. For the\npurposes of this paragraph, where a housing accommodation is rented to a\nnot-for-profit for providing, as of and after the effective date of the chapter\nof the laws of two thousand nineteen that amended this paragraph, permanent\nhousing to individuals who are or were homeless or at risk of homelessness, affiliated individuals authorized to use such accommodations by such not-for\nprofit shall be deemed to be tenants.
