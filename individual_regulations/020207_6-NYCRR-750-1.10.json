  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 750-1.10 - Effluent limitations in issued SPDES permits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In the application of effluent\nlimitations, water quality standards, and other applicable requirements, pursuant to this Part, the department may specify daily average, monthly\naverage, seven-day average, annual average, 12-month rolling average, peak\nhourly, annual maximum, instantaneous maximum and daily maximum quantitative\nlimitations for the level of pollutants in the authorized discharge in terms of\nweight or, as in the case of flow, pH, temperature, and for any other\npollutants not appropriately expressed by weight, in other appropriate terms. The department may, in addition to or in lieu of the specification of daily\nquantitative limitations by weight or by other terms, specify other\nlimitations, such as average or maximum concentration limits, on the pollutants\nin the authorized discharge. (b) Any point source, the construction of which is commenced after October 18, 1972, and which is so constructed or physically modified, provided the cost of\nsuch modification exceeds 50 percent of the initial capital costs of the\nfacility or new source which meets the applicable promulgated new source\nperformance standards before the commencement of the discharge, to meet all\napplicable standards of performance set forth in the point source SPDES permit\nand fact sheet shall not be subject to a more stringent technology based\nstandard of performance (under section 301[b][2] of the act) requiring the\nconstruction of additional treatment facilities during a 10-year period\nbeginning on the date of completion of such construction or during the period\nof depreciation or amortization of such facility for the purposes of section\n167 or 169 (or both) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, whichever period\nends first; provided, however, that if the operation of such source causes or\ncontributes to any contravention of any State water quality standard the\ndepartment shall require that abatement action be taken by the permittee and\nmodify the permit pursuant to section\n750-1.18\nof this Subpart. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of\nthis Part, when effluent limitations are established they must be at least as\nstringent as the effluent limitations previously required unless the department\ndetermines that an exception is warranted because the circumstances on which\nthe previous permit was based have materially and substantially changed since\nthe time the permit was issued and would constitute cause for permit\nmodification. A permit may be modified to contain a less stringent effluent\nlimitation applicable to a pollutant, if: (1)\nmaterial and substantial alterations or additions to the permitted facility\noccurred after permit issuance, which justify the application of a less\nstringent effluent limitation; (2)\n(i) information is available, which was not\navailable at the time of permit issuance (other than revised regulations, guidance, or test methods), which would have justified the application of a\nless stringent effluent limitation at the time of permit issuance; or\n(ii)\nthe department determines that technical\nmistakes or mistaken interpretations of law were made in issuing the permit\nunder this Part; (3)\n(i) a less stringent effluent limitation is\nnecessary because of events over which the permittee has no control and the\npermittee demonstrates that it has thoroughly studied or implemented all\nfeasible alternative means to remedy the situation, and is still unable to meet\nthe limitations; or\n(ii)\nthe\ndepartment reviewed the data supplied by the permittee and is in agreement that\nno feasible alternatives to remedy the situation exist; provided\nthat: (4)\nthe permittee\nhas received a permit modification under section 301(c), (g), (h), (i), (k), (n), or 316(a) of the act (see section\n750-1.25\nof this\n\nSubpart); (5)\nthe permittee has\ninstalled the treatment facilities required to meet the effluent limitations in\nthe previous permit and has properly operated and maintained the facilities but\nhas nevertheless been unable to achieve the previous effluent limitations, in\nwhich case the limitations in the reviewed, reissued, or modified permit may\nreflect the level of pollutant control actually achieved (but shall not be less\nstringent than required by effluent guidelines in effect at the time of permit\nmodification); (6)\nthe discharge is\nto non-attainment waters for the limited pollutant and the limit is based on a\nfinal or interim TMDL or other waste load allocation method and the TMDL is set\nto assure attainment of the water quality standard; or\n(7)\nthe limit is for attainment waters for\nthe limited pollutant and based on a final or interim TMDL or other waste load\nallocation method and the TMDL is set to assure attainment of the water quality\nstandard and the limit has been subjected to an anti degradation review in\naccordance with the department's anti degradation policy; (8)\nthe modifications allowed in paragraphs\n(6) and (7) of this subdivision shall not apply to any revised waste load\nallocations or any alternative where the cumulative effect of such revised\nallocations results in a decrease in the amount of pollutants discharged into\nthe concerned waters, and such revised allocations are not the result of a\ndischarger eliminating or substantially reducing its discharge of pollutants\ndue to complying with the requirements of this Chapter or for reasons otherwise\nunrelated to water quality. (d) In no event may a permit be modified in\naccordance with subdivision (c) of this section to contain an effluent\nlimitation that is less stringent than required by effluent guidelines, including variances thereto, in effect at the time the permit is modified. In\nno event may such a permit to discharge into waters be modified in accordance\nwith subdivision (c) of this section to contain a less stringent effluent\nlimitation if the implementation of such limitation would result in a violation\nof a water quality standard or guidance value applicable to such waters as set\nforth in Parts 700-706, et seq. of this Title.
