  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 890.6 - Leak detection and repair\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nOwners of water supply systems serving\nthe public (purveyors) in the Delaware River Basin that distribute water\nsupplies in excess of an average of 100,000 gallons per day (gpd) during any\n30-day period shall develop and undertake a systematic program to monitor and\ncontrol leakage within their water supply system. Such a program shall at a\nminimum include: periodic surveys to monitor leakage, enumerate non-revenue\nwater (or in instances where AWWA methodology as set forth in section\n890.8\nof this Part has not yet\nbeen adopted, enumerate unaccounted-for water), and determine the current\nstatus of system infrastructure; recommendations to monitor and control\nleakage; and a schedule for the implementation of such recommendations. Each\npurveyor's program shall be subject to review and approval by the designated\nagency in the state where the system is located. (2)\n\nNon-revenue water\nis\ndefined by AWWA as the sum of unbilled authorized consumption, apparent losses\nand real losses. Non-revenue water percent\nis defined as\nnon-revenue water divided by the amount of water entering the distribution\nsystem times 100 percent. (3)\n\nUnaccounted-for water\nis defined as the amount of water\nentering the distribution system minus the amount of water delivered through\nservice meters. Unaccounted-for water percent\nis defined as\nunaccounted-for water divided by the amount of water entering the distribution\nsystem times 100 percent. (4)\n\nThe\ndesignated State agencies are: Delaware Department of Natural Resources and\n\nEnvironmental Control; New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection; New\n\nYork Department of Health; and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental\n\nProtection. (b) Each\npurveyor shall strive to minimize system leakage to levels as guided by\nIWA/AWWA Water Audit Methodology (AWWA Water Loss Control Committee [WLCC]\nWater Audit Software) and corresponding AWWA guidance. After a purveyor has submitted to the appropriate\ndesignated agency its initial program to monitor and control leakage, the\npurveyor shall prepare and submit a revised and updated program every three\nyears thereafter or at such greater frequency as may be required by the\ndesignated State agency. The designated State agency may require more frequent\nprogram submission from purveyors with unaccounted-for or non-revenue water\nthat is in excess of 15 percent. (c) Any project approvals hereafter granted\npursuant to section\n3.8\nof the DRBC compact or any\nrenewal of a project approval shall be subject to the provisions of this\nregulation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n890.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
