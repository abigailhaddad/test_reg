  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 531.1 - Imposition of compensating use tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1110\n(a) Imposition. The compensating use tax is imposed on every person for the\nuse within New York State of tangible personal property and certain services\ndescribed in subdivision (b) of this section, except to the extent they have\nbeen or will be subject to sales tax and except to the extent they are exempt\nfrom use tax. Example 1: A lumber yard in New York State purchases, for resale, a\ncar load of lumber from a west coast supplier who is not a registered New York\n\nState vendor and who will deliver the lumber to the purchaser by rail within\nthis State. No tax is collected by the supplier. Upon delivery of the lumber, the purchaser withdraws enough lumber to construct workbenches and shelves in\nits milling room. The lumber withdrawn for use by the lumber yard is subject to\na compensating use tax. (b) Property and services subject to tax. The compensating use tax is imposed on the use within New\n\nYork State of the following tangible personal property and services. (1)\n\nTangible personal property purchased at\nretail. (2)\n(i) Tangible personal property manufactured, processed or assembled by the user; (a) if\nitems of the same kind are offered for sale by him in the regular course of\nbusiness; or\n(b) if items are used\nas such or incorporated into a structure, building, or real property by a\ncontractor, subcontractor or repairman in erecting structures or buildings, or\nbuilding on, or otherwise adding to, altering, improving, maintaining, servicing or repairing real property, property or land, as the terms real\nproperty, property or land are defined in the real property tax law, if items\nof the same kind are not offered for sale as such by such contractor, subcontractor or repairman or other user in the regular course of\nbusiness. (ii)\n\nIn\nessence, when a manufacturer, processor or assembler uses its products as such\nor incorporates the product into real property it has made a use of the\nproperty subject to the compensating use tax. This is so whether or not it\noffers items of the same kind for sale in the regular course of business and\nwhether the product was manufactured, processed or assembled inside or outside\n\nNew York State. Example 2: A company with manufacturing facilities located in New\n\nJersey that manufactures lawn furniture exclusively, made office furniture for\nits own use in its New York City offices. The use of this office furniture is\nsubject to tax. Example 3: Company C manufactures and installs custom designed, in-\nground swimming pools. The pools are manufactured at Company C's plant in New\n\nJersey and are transported to the customer's site where Company C installs the\npool. Company C only sells the pools on an installed basis. When Company C\ninstalls its pool at a customer's site in New York State Company C has made a\nuse of its manufactured product within New York State. (iii)\n\nWhile the use of tangible personal\nproperty manufactured, processed or assembled by the user is subject to\ncompensating use tax, the base on which the use tax is computed varies\ndepending on whether the manufacturer, processor or assembler offers items of\nthe same kind for sale in the regular course of business. (See section\n531.3\n[b]\nof this Part.)\n\nCross-reference: See section\n528.28\nof this Title regarding exemption from tax for property donated by the\nmanufacturer, processor or assembler of the property to an exempt\norganization.

The data provided by the survey group is obtained from its records and is an\ninformation service which is not private or individual in nature. When the\nreport and data is sent to the New York firm no tax is collected by the survey\ngroup. Although no tax was collected, the New York firm is liable for a\ncompensating use tax on the price paid for the information\nreceived. (4)\n\nServices\nsubject to tax under subdivisions (2) or (3) of section\n1105 (c)\nof the Tax Law\nwhich have been performed on tangible personal property however acquired where\nnot acquired for resale.

The owner of the engines was charged for the\nrebuilding services and replacement parts but was not charged a sales tax. the\nrebuilding service and replacement parts are subject to the compensating use\ntax.
