Tit. 20 § 528.18 - Tangible personal property sold by a contractor to a person other than an exempt organization\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1115(a)(17)\n\nTangible personal property sold by a contractor, subcontractor or repairman to a person, other than an organization exempt\npursuant to section\n1116 (a)\nof the Tax Law, for whom he is adding to, or improving real property, property or land by a\ncapital improvement, is exempt, if the property sold by the contractor, subcontractor or repairman becomes an integral component part of the real\nproperty. Example 1: A contractor enters into a contract to build an addition to\na home for $35,000. The terms of the contract are time and materials ($20,000\nfor materials and $15,000 for labor).
