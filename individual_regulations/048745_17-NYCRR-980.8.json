  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 980.8 - Designation of coordinated service operator\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General requirements. On or before\ncompletion of its draft coordinated public transportation service plan, a rural\ncounty recipient of planning and implementation funds shall designate an\noperator of passenger transportation to be its Coordinated Service Operator\n(CSO). The county's Coordinated Service Operator shall be responsible for the\nmanagement, control, operation and maintenance of all elements, including any\nspecialized components, of the county's coordinated public transportation\nservice as described in the county's adopted and approved plan, and at the\ncounty's discretion, for applying for future operating and capital assistance\ngrants, and future updating of the county's plan. The county government itself\nor a public transportation authority may be designated as the CSO (see also\n\nSection\n980.11\nof this Part), or a county\nmay contract with another entity to be the CSO. If a county contracts with\nanother entity, a competitive process for choosing the CSO must be used to\nafford private bus and taxi operators, or any other qualified party, an\nopportunity to operate the service. In such cases, the CSO must be an entity\nthat has been granted or will obtain operating authority from the Department as\na common carrier of the general public, for the coordinated service. If a\n\nCounty Government itself already owns and operates a public transportation\nservice, it is expected that the county will designate itself as its CSO. In\nsuch cases, if the county does not designate itself, justification for\nestablishing another public transportation service within the county, including\nthe economy, efficiency and effectiveness of doing so, and the prospects of\navoiding service duplication, must be included in the county's plan. The\ndesignated CSO must be an operator that is administratively, financially and\noperationally capable of managing and operating a countywide transportation\nsystem and one that is, or will be, willing and able to provide general purpose\npassenger transportation without preference to any population sub-group or\nagency affiliated clientele. If the designated CSO is one that did not have a\nprior history as a general purpose transportation operator, the process used\nand the operator designated must be included as a subject of the public hearing\non the county's draft plan. In some cases, a new private, non-profit\ncorporation may be established to be the CSO. If the designated CSO is an\nexisting private, non-profit corporation, that corporation must modify its\narticles of incorporation as necessary to establish it as an operator of\ngeneral purpose passenger transportation and agree to obtain operating\nauthority from the Department as a common carrier of the general\npublic. (b) Sub-contracted\n\nServices. For other than infrequent or incidental trips, and in some limited\ncircumstances, a coordinated service operator in a rural county may purchase, through sub-contract, portions of the county's coordinated service from other\ntransportation operators, under the following conditions: (1)\njustification for doing so must be\nprovided in the county's adopted plan and that justification must be based upon\none or more of the following: (i) the need to\nprovide greater geographic area coverage by the coordinated service; (ii)\nthe need for specialized services, as\ndefined in this Part, which may be market-segmented services based upon the\ndiffering amounts of physical assistance or service level quality needed by\npassengers; (iii)\nthe need to\nprovide out-of-county services; or\n(iv)\nthe need to extend the hours of service\navailability to evening or weekend periods; (2)\nthe coordinated service operator must\nitself operate the majority of local passenger transportation service within\nthe county; (3)\nthe coordinated\nservice operator must control the operation of any such subcontracted service, including the subcontracted service's hours of operation, service area, service\nquality and design, routes, schedules, fares and reimbursement rates, and other\noperating practices; (4)\nany\nsubcontracted service operator must possess, or obtain, operating authority\nfrom the Department as a common or contract carrier; (5)\nthere must be no duplication of service\nof any kind; (6)\nvehicles to be\nused by any subcontractor in providing a portion of the county's coordinated\nservice must meet Departmental vehicle inspection requirements, and must be\nprominently identified and marked, during its subcontract hours, as available\nto the general public and being a part of the county's coordinated public\ntransportation service; and\n(7)\n\nRegular and continuing services operated by a subcontractor must meet all\neligibility requirements of this Part.
