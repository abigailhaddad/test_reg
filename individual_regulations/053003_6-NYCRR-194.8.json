  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 194.8 - Protection of adjoining property\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor prescribed fires and prescribed burns, a minimum distance\nbetween the fire and property of adjacent landowners shall be maintained in\norder to protect such property. This distance shall be determined by analyzing\nthe prescribed fire requirements (including weather information), calculated\nflame spread and the sensitivity of the adjacent property. Under normal\ncircumstances prescribed fires shall not be set or allowed to burn within 75\nfeet of an adjacent property. A written waiver of this limitation by owner(s)\nof the adjacent property shall be included in the plan, where applicable. The\ndepartment may also require an expansion of the 75 foot minimum buffer, if\nconditions so warrant. Prescribed fires and prescribed burns shall be contained\nwithin a predetermined area and shall be managed to the greatest extent\npossible to avoid damage to adjacent property. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n194.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
