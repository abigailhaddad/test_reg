Parts of a field shall not be eligible for\ncertification. (2)\n\nIsolation\nrequirement. A specific commercial hybrid to be inspected for certification\nmust be so located that it is not less than one mile away from any other\nvarieties of any species in bloom at the same time as the seed field. This\nrequirement shall not apply to small garden areas with less than 50 plants\nproviding such garden areas are not within 1,000 feet of the seed production\nfield. (3)\n\nPollinating insect\nrequirement. In order to insure adequate cross pollination there shall be at\nleast two colonies of bees per acre preferably located in or immediately\nadjacent to the field boundary. In no case shall the bees be located more than\n1,000 feet from a boundary of the field. (b) Specific requirements. (1)\n\nOfftype plants. (i) Plant spacing to permit inspection of the\ncrop for offtype plants. The total crop must be thinned to single plants with\nthe pollen parent spaced no closer than six inches between plants and the seed\nparent spaced no closer than 15 inches between plants. (ii)\n\nPollen parent. On any one inspection\nthere shall not be more than four offtype plants per acre of pollen parent. (Approximately one offtype in 5,000 plants.)\n(iii)\n\nSeed parent. On any one inspection\nthere shall not be more than three offtype plants per acre of seed parent. (Approximately one offtype in 2,000 plants.)\n\nNote: In determining the number of offtype plants for this\npurpose, only those shall be counted on which the male flowers are in bloom, or\nhave bloomed during the seed parent debudding period. (2)\n\nDebudding. On any one\ninspection during the debudding period, there shall not be more than an average\nof two male flowers which have bloomed per 100 seed parent plants. The total\nmale flowers for three or more inspections shall not exceed 85 per cent of the\nnumber of inspections times the maximum tolerance for one inspection. (3)\n\nVirus. On any one inspection prior to the\nfinal inspection the total number of plants infected with squash mosaic and/or\nother seed-borne viruses shall not exceed 0.01 per cent, nor shall the total\nnumber of plants infected by viruses other than those known to be seed-borne\nexceed 1.0 per cent. On the final fruit inspection the total of all virus\ninfected fruit shall be none. Any fruit found showing evidence of virus\ninfection shall be removed and destroyed in the presence of the\ninspector. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n114.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
