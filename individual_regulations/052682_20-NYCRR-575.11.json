  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 575.11 - Examples of taxable and nontaxable conveyances\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nfollowing are examples of conveyances which are subject to the real estate\ntransfer tax. (1)\nA conveyance in exchange\nfor other property is taxable. If the other property is real property or an\ninterest therein, the tax will apply to both conveyances. (2)\nA conveyance by a defaulting mortgagor or\ndebtor to the mortgagee or lienor, or its agent, nominee or an entity owned in\nwhole by such mortgagee or lienor, in lieu of an action to foreclose a mortgage\nor lien, is subject to tax. (i) In the case of\nnonrecourse debt, where the grantee is the mortgagee or lienor, or its agent, nominee or an entity wholly owned by such mortgagee or lienor and the amount of\nany other liens or encumbrances as described in clause (\nb\n) of\nthis subparagraph secures nonrecourse debt only, consideration includes, but is\nnot limited to, the sum of the following: (a) the unpaid balance of the debt secured by the mortgage; (b) the total amount of any other liens or\nencumbrances remaining on the real property after the conveyance, whether the\nunderlying indebtedness is assumed or taken subject to (see section\n575.1\n[d][1]\nof\nthis Part for information on the treatment of continuing liens); and\n(c) the sum of any other amount paid by the\ngrantee for the real property. This sum shall not include any state or local\ntransfer taxes paid by the grantee in connection with the conveyance, provided\nthat the grantee has not contractually assumed the liability for the payment of\nsuch taxes or has not released its right to seek recovery of the payment from\nthe grantor. (ii)\n\nIn the\ncase of recourse debt, where the grantee is the mortgagee or lienor, or its\nagent, nominee or an entity wholly owned by such mortgagee or lienor and the\namount of any other liens or encumbrances as described in clause\n(i)(\nb\n) of this paragraph secures recourse debt only, consideration includes, but is not limited to, the sum of the amounts described\nin clauses (i)(\na\n)-(\nc\n) of this paragraph. Provided however, where the sum of the amounts described in\nsuch clauses (\na\n) and (\nb\n) of such subparagraph\nexceeds the fair market value of the real property as of the date of\nconveyance, such consideration shall be the fair market value of the real\nproperty plus the amount described in such clause (\nc\n) of such\nsubparagraph as the aggregate amount of debt cancelled, assumed or taken\nsubject to in connection with the conveyance is limited to the fair market\nvalue of the real property. For purposes of this subdivision, a debt is\nrecourse debt to the extent that, as of the date of conveyance, the grantor or\na person related to the grantor including any guarantor, bears the economic\nrisk of loss for the debt beyond any loss attributable to the value of the\nproperty securing the debt. Example 1: Bank A made a nonrecourse loan of $10 million to individual\nX secured by a mortgage on New York State real property owned by X. X also\nprovided a personal recourse guarantee of the last $1 million of the debt, that\nis, if the value of the mortgaged real property decreased to less than $10\nmillion X would be obligated to pay the difference between $10 million and the\nvalue of the mortgaged real property to Bank A up to a maximum amount of $1\nmillion. X defaulted on the loan. The real property was conveyed to Bank A in\nlieu of foreclosure and, at the time of the conveyance, the real property had a\nfair market value of $8 million. As a result of the conveyance the $9 million\nnonrecourse component of the loan is discharged. Simultaneously, Bank A\ndischarged X from any obligation under the personal guarantee. The\nconsideration for the conveyance consists only of the $9 million nonrecourse\ncomponent of the loan that was discharged, as no part of the excess $1 million\npersonal obligation can be satisfied by the conveyance of the real\nproperty. Example 2: Same facts as Example 1, except that instead of the\npersonal guarantee being on the last $1 million, X guaranteed the first $1\nmillion\ni.e., X would be liable for any deficiency only if the\nmortgaged real property was worth less than $1 million. Since the fair market\nvalue of the real property at the time of the conveyance was $8 million, there\nwas no continuing recourse exposure to X, and therefore the consideration for\nthe conveyance is equal to $10 million, which was the full amount of the\nnonrecourse indebtedness discharged as a result of the conveyance of the real\nproperty. Debt that was originally nonrecourse and which was\nconverted to recourse debt will be so treated as recourse debt provided that\nthe conversion to recourse debt and the conveyance of the real property are\nnot, in substance, integrated steps or part of a plan to decrease the\nconsideration for the conveyance so as to decrease the tax for the\nconveyance. (3)\nA\nconveyance pursuant to a mortgage foreclosure or any other action governed by\nthe provisions of the Real Property Actions and Proceedings Law, such as the\nenforcement of a mechanic's lien pursuant to article 3 of the Lien Law, is\nsubject to tax. The consideration is determined as follows: (i) In the case of a nonrecourse debt, where\nthe grantee is the mortgagee or lienor or its agent, nominee or an entity\nwholly owned by such mortgagee or lienor, and the amount of any other\ncontinuing liens or encumbrances secure nonrecourse debt only, consideration\nincludes, but is not limited to, the higher of the following: (a) the sum of: (1)\nthe price paid by the grantee (the bid\nprice); and\n(2)\nthe total amount of\nany other liens or encumbrances remaining on the real property after the\nconveyance, whether the underlying indebtedness is assumed or taken subject to\n(see section\n575.1\n[d][1]\nof\nthis Part for information on the treatment of continuing liens); or\n(b) the sum of: (1)\nthe amount of the judgment of\nforeclosure; and\n(2)\nthe total\namount of any other liens or encumbrances remaining on the real property after\nthe conveyance, whether the underlying indebtedness is assumed or taken subject\nto (see section\n575.1\n[d][1]\nof\nthis Part for information on the treatment of continuing liens). Provided however, in the case where the amounts described\nin clauses (\na\n) and (\nb\n) of this subparagraph\ninvolve recourse debt only and the higher of such amounts exceeds the fair\nmarket value of the real property at the time of the conveyance, then the\nconsideration is equal to the fair market value or the real property as of the\ndate of conveyance, since the aggregate amount of the debt cancelled, assumed\nor taken subject to in connection with the conveyance is limited to the fair\nmarket value of the real property. (ii)\n\nWhere a person unrelated to the\nmortgagee or the lienor is the grantee and regardless of whether the debt is\nrecourse or nonrecourse, consideration includes, but is not limited to the sum\nof: (a) the amount of the bid price; and\n(b) the total amount of any\nother liens or encumbrances remaining on the real property after the\nconveyance, whether the underlying indebtedness is assumed or taken subject to\n(see section\n575.1\n[d][1]\nof\nthis Part for information on the treatment of continuing liens). For the purposes of this paragraph and paragraphs (2), (15)\nand (16) of this subdivision a grantee is related to the mortgagee or lienor to\nthe extent that the mere change of identity or form of ownership exemption\nprovided at section\n1405 (b)(6)\nof the Tax Law would apply to a conveyance by\nthe mortgagee or lienor to the grantee. (iii)\n\nWhere the grantee is an entity\nbeneficially owned in part by the mortgagee or lienor and a person unrelated to\nthe mortgagee or lienor and the debt held by such mortgagee or lienor is\nnonrecourse debt and any continuing liens or encumbrances secure nonrecourse\ndebt only, consideration includes, but is not limited to, the sum of clauses\n(\na\n) and (\nb\n) of this subparagraph: (a) the higher of the sum of the following\nmultiplied by the percentage which represents the mortgagee's or lienor's\nbeneficial ownership interest in the grantee: (1)\n(i) the\nbid price; and\n(ii)\nthe total\namount of any other liens or encumbrances remaining on the real property after\nthe conveyance, whether the underlying indebtedness is assumed or taken subject\nto; or\n(2)\n(i) the amount of the judgment of\nforeclosure; and\n(ii)\nthe total\namount of any other liens or encumbrances remaining on the real property after\nthe conveyance, whether the underlying indebtedness is assumed or taken subject\nto (see section\n575.1\n[d][1]\nof\nthis Part for information on the treatment of continuing liens); and\n(b) the sum of the bid\nprice, and the total amount of any other liens or encumbrances remaining on the\nreal property after the conveyance, whether the underlying indebtedness is\nassumed or taken subject to, multiplied by the percentage which represents such\nunrelated person's beneficial ownership interest in the grantee (see section\n575.1\n[d][1]\nof\nthis Part for information on the treatment of continuing liens). (iv)\n\nWhere the grantee is an\nentity beneficially owned in part by the mortgagee or lienor and in part by a\nperson unrelated to the mortgagee or lienor and the debt held by such mortgagee\nor lienor is recourse debt and any continuing liens or encumbrances secure\nrecourse debt only, consideration includes, but is not limited to, the sum of\nclauses (iii)(\na\n) and (\nb\n) of this\nsubparagraph. Provided however, where the higher of the amounts described\nin subclauses (iii)(\na\n)(\n1\n) and\n(\n2\n) of this paragraph exceeds the fair market value of the\nreal property multiplied by the percentage which represents the mortgagee's or\nlienor's beneficial ownership interest in the grantee, then such portion of\nconsideration as described in such clause (\na\n) is equal to the\nfair market value of the real property multiplied by such percentage since the\naggregate amount of the debt cancelled, assumed or taken subject to in\nconnection with the conveyance is limited to the fair market value of the real\nproperty multiplied by such percentage. (See subparagraph [2][ii] of this\nsubdivision for further information on recourse\ndebt.)\n(4)\nA\nconveyance to a corporation in exchange for shares of its capital stock is\nsubject to tax to the extent that there is a change in beneficial\nownership. (5)\nA conveyance by a\ncorporation in liquidation or in dissolution to its shareholders is subject to\ntax to the extent that there is a change in beneficial ownership. (6)\nA conveyance of standing timber and mines\nis subject to tax. (7)\nA conveyance\nby the United Nations, the United States of America, the State of New York, or\nany of their agencies, instrumentalities or political subdivisions is subject\nto tax unless the grantee is another of such governmental organizations or\nentities. (8)\nA conveyance by a\npartner to the partnership as a contribution of partnership assets is subject\nto tax to the extent that there is a change in beneficial ownership. (9)\nA conveyance of a perpetual easement or\nan easement for a term of years or part of a year is subject to tax. (10)\nA conveyance from one spouse to the\nother pursuant to the terms of a divorce or separation agreement is subject to\ntax. (There is a rebuttable presumption in such case that the consideration for\nthe conveyance, which includes the relinquishment of marital rights, is equal\nto the fair market value of the interest in the real property\nconveyed.)\n(11)\nA conveyance to\npartners upon the termination and liquidation of a partnership is subject to\ntax to the extent that there is a change in beneficial ownership. (12)\nA conveyance by a sponsor to a\ncooperative housing corporation is subject to tax. (Consideration in such case\nincludes the amount of cash received by the sponsor, the amount of any\nmortgages, liens or encumbrances on the real property and the fair market value\nof the shares in the cooperative housing corporation which are transferred to\nthe sponsor.)\n(13)\nA conveyance of\nreal property to an industrial development agency (IDA) by a person who is not\nthe beneficiary of the IDA financing, at the direction of such beneficiary, with such beneficiary subsequently leasing the property from the IDA, is\nsubject to tax. In such a conveyance, the beneficiary of the IDA financing and\nnot the IDA is deemed to be the grantee, and therefore the exemption described\nat section\n575.9\n(c)(1)\nof\nthis Part does not apply. (14)\nA\nconveyance of real property by an IDA to a person who is not the beneficiary of\nthe IDA financing where such conveyance is made at the direction of such\nbeneficiary is subject to tax. In such a conveyance, the beneficiary of the IDA\nfinancing is deemed to be the grantor of the conveyance. (15)\n(i) A\nconveyance of real property pursuant to a secured party's enforcement of a\nlien, security interest or other rights on or in shares of stock in a\ncooperative housing corporation and/or associated proprietary lease, upon\ndefault by a debtor is subject to tax. In such a conveyance, the grantor is the\ndefaulted debtor and the grantee is the secured party or its agent, nominee or\nan entity wholly owned by such secured party who enforces such lien, security\ninterest or other rights on or in such shares and/or associated proprietary\nlease(s). Consideration, in the case of nonrecourse debt, where the grantee is\nthe secured party, or its agent, nominee or an entity wholly owned by such\nsecured party, includes but is not limited to, the sum of the following: (a) the unpaid balance of the debt secured by\nthe shares of stock in the cooperative housing corporation and/or associated\nproprietary lease(s); (b) the total\namount of any other liens, security interests or other obligations remaining on\nthe shares of stock in the cooperative housing corporation and/or associated\nproprietary lease(s) after the conveyance, whether the underlying indebtedness\nis assumed or taken subject to (see section\n575.1\n[d][1]\nof\nthis Part for information on the treatment of continuing liens); (c) a pro rata portion of the total amount of\nany other liens or encumbrances that remain on the real property of the\ncooperative housing corporation after the conveyance. However, see section\n575.1\n(d)(6)\nof\nthis Part for information on the treatment of liens or encumbrances on the real\nproperty of the cooperative housing corporation; and\n(d) any other amount paid by the grantee for\nthe real property. This amount shall not include any state or local transfer\ntaxes paid by the grantee in connection with the conveyance, provided that the\ngrantee has not contractually assumed the liability for the payment of such\ntaxes or has not released its right to seek recovery of the payment from the\ngrantor. (ii)\n\nConsideration in the case of recourse debt, where the grantee is the secured\nparty, or its agent, nominee or an entity wholly owned by such secured party, includes but is not limited to the sum of the amounts described in clauses\n(i)(\na\n)-(\nd\n) of this paragraph. Provided however, where the sum of the amount described in\nclauses (\na\n) and (\nb\n) of such subparagraph\nexceeds the fair market value of the shares of stock in the cooperative housing\ncorporation and/or associated proprietary lease(s) as of the date of the\nconveyance, consideration shall be the fair market value of the shares of stock\nin the cooperative housing corporation and/or associated proprietary lease(s)\nbeing conveyed, plus the amounts described in such clauses (\nc\n)\nand (\nd\n) of such subparagraph. (See subparagraph [2][ii] of\nthis subdivision for further information on recourse debt.)\n\nExample 1: A is the owner of 30 shares of stock in a cooperative\nhousing corporation related to a proprietary lease of a commercial unit. The 30\nshares represent five percent of the total number of shares in the cooperative\nhousing corporation. The building of the cooperative housing corporation is\nencumbered by the lien of a mortgage having a current unpaid balance of\n$2,500,000. A's 30 shares have a fair market value of $1,200,000. A pledged its\n30 shares to C as security for a loan of $1,600,000. The debt owed by A to C is\nnonrecourse indebtedness. The current unpaid balance of the debt is $1,740,000, including accrued interest. C is presently enforcing its security interest\nagainst A's shares of stock in the cooperative housing corporation. The\nconsideration for the resulting conveyance is computed as follows: Unpaid balance of debt\n$1,740,000\n\nPro-rata portion of mortgage indebtedness ($2,500,000\n* 5%)\n+\n125,000\n\nConsideration for conveyance\n$1,865,000\n\nExample 2: Same facts as in example 1, except that the debt owed from\nA to C is recourse indebtedness. The fair market value of A's shares of stock\nin the cooperative housing corporation is less than the sum of the unpaid\nbalance of the debt ($1,740,000). The consideration for the resulting\nconveyance is computed as follows: Fair market value of the cooperative shares\n$1,200,000\n\nPro rata portion of mortgage indebtedness ($2,500,000\n* 5%)\n+\n125,000\n\nConsideration for conveyance\n$1,325,000\n(16)\nA conveyance of real property pursuant\nto a secured party's enforcement of a lien, security interest or other rights\non or in shares of stock, partnership interests or other instruments, upon\ndefault by a debtor (\ni.e., the transfer or acquisition of a\ncontrolling interest in an entity with an interest in real property), is\nsubject to tax. In such a conveyance, the grantor is the defaulted debtor and\nthe grantee is the secured party or its agent, nominee or an entity wholly\nowned by such secured party who enforces such lien, security interest or other\nrights on or in such shares, partnership interests or other instruments. The\nconsideration for such conveyances, where the grantee is the secured party, or\nits agent, nominee or an entity wholly owned by such secured party, regardless\nof whether the debt is recourse or nonrecourse, is the lesser of the following: (i) the fair market value of the real\nproperty as of the date of conveyance multiplied by the percentage in the\nentity being transferred or acquired; or\n(ii)\nthe sum which includes, but is not\nlimited to, the following: (a) a reasonable\napportionment to the interests in real property owned by the entity of the\nunpaid balance of the debt secured by the ownership interest in the\nentity; (b) a reasonable\napportionment to the interests in real property owned by the entity of the\namount of any liens, security interests or other obligations remaining on the\nownership interest in the entity after the conveyance, whether the underlying\nindebtedness is assumed or taken subject to; (c) a reasonable apportionment to the\ninterests in real property owned by the entity of the amount of any liens or\nencumbrances remaining on the real property of the entity multiplied by the\npercentage in the entity being transferred or acquired (see section\n575.1\n[d][1]\nof\nthis Part for information on the treatment of continuing liens); (d) a reasonable apportionment to the\ninterests in real property owned by the entity of the amount of any other debt\nor obligation of the entity multiplied by the percentage in the entity being\ntransferred or acquired; and\n(e) a\nreasonable apportionment to the interests in real property owned by the entity\nof any other amount paid by the grantee for the conveyance. Such amount shall\nnot include any state or local transfer taxes paid by the grantee in connection\nwith the conveyance, provided that the grantee has not contractually assumed\nthe liability for the payment of such taxes or has not released its right to\nseek recovery of the payment from the grantor. Example 3: X is the owner of 100 percent of the voting stock in Y\nCorporation. Y Corporation's only asset is a parcel of real property located in\n\nNew York State. The fair market value of the real property is $2,000,000. The\nreal property is encumbered by the lien of a mortgage having a current unpaid\nbalance of $1,500,000, held by B Bank. X pledged 60 percent of its Y voting\nstock to Z as security for a debt of $400,000. The current unpaid balance of\nthe debt is $450,000, including accrued interest. Z is presently enforcing its\nsecurity interest in the voting stock of X. Z's enforcement of its security\ninterest in the voting stock of X results in both a transfer and acquisition of\na controlling interest. The consideration for the conveyance is computed as\nfollows: (\na\n) Unpaid balance of debt\n$450,000\n\nPro rata portion of mortgage indebtedness ($1,500,000\n* 60)\n+\n900,000\n\nTotal, $1,350,000\n(\nb\n) FMV of real\nproperty-$2,000,000 * 60%=$1,200,000\n*\n* The amount computed in (\nb\n) ($1,200,000)\nis the consideration for the conveyance as it is less then the amount computed\nin (\na\n) ($1,350,000). Example 4: S is the owner of 100 percent of the voting stock of K\nCorporation. K's assets consist of a parcel of real property located in New\n\nYork State and other tangible assets. The fair market value of the parcel of\nreal property is $2,100,000 and the fair market value of the other assets is\n$300,000. The real property is encumbered by the lien of a mortgage having a\ncurrent unpaid balance of $700,000. Also, K Corporation has other debts\ntotaling $300,000. S pledged 60 percent of its voting stock to J as security\nfor a debt of $500,000. The current unpaid balance of the debt owed to J is\n$550,000, including accrued interest. J is presently enforcing its security\ninterest in the voting stock owned by S. J's enforcement of its security\ninterest in the voting stock of S results in both a transfer and an acquisition\nof a controlling interest. The consideration for the conveyance is computed as\nfollows: Reasonable apportionment based on fair market value of assets owned by\nK Corporation: (\na\n) Unpaid balance of debt\n$550,000\n\nPart of mortgage indebtedness includible in amount to\nbe apportioned ($700,000 * 60%)\n420,000\n\nPart of other debt of entity includible in amount to\nbe apportioned (300,000 * 60%)\n+\n180,000\n\nAmount to be apportioned\n$1,150,000\n\nReasonable apportionment based on fair market value of\nassets owned by K Corporation: $1,150,000 *\n$2,100,000\n/\n$2,400,000\n=\n$1,006,250\n*\n(\nb\n) FMV of real\nproperty- $2,100,000 * 60%= $1,260,000\n* The amount computed in (\na\n) ($1,006,250)\nis the consideration for the conveyance as it is less than the amount computed\nin (\nb\n) ($1,260,000). (b) The following are examples of\nconveyances which are not subject to the real estate transfer tax. (1)\nA conveyance of real property by the\nbeneficiary of the industrial development agency (IDA) financing to the IDA, in\nconnection with the receipt of such financing is not subject to tax. (2)\nA conveyance of real property by the IDA, as grantor, to the beneficiary of the IDA financing, as grantee is not subject\nto tax. Footnotes\n* The amount computed in (\nb\n) ($1,200,000)\nis the consideration for the conveyance as it is less then the amount computed\nin (\na\n) ($1,350,000). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
