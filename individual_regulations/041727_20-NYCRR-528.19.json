(1)\n\nTangible personal property sold by a\nperson at his residence is exempt, provided the person making the sale meets\nthe following prerequisites: (i) such person\ndoes not engage in such sales for more than three days in a calendar year, except that this restriction shall not apply to a person under 16 years of\nage: (ii)\nsuch person or any member\nof his household does not conduct a trade or business in which similar items\nare sold; and\n(iii)\nthe receipts\nfrom such sales can reasonably be expected not to exceed $600 in a calendar\nyear. Example 1: A person 16 years of age or older has a garage sale at his\nresidence for three days in a particular calendar year, for which his receipts\nare $500. Later, during the same calendar year, he has another garage sale, the\nreceipts from which are $100. The first $500 is exempt. Since he exceeded the\nthree-day limit per calendar year, the receipts from the subsequent sale are\nsubject to tax although his total receipts for the calendar year do not exceed\n$600. Example 2: A person under 16 years makes and sells various gift items\nfrom his residence. He reasonably expects his receipts to be $600 or less for\nthe calendar year. However, his receipts for the year are $800. The first $600\nis exempt from tax and the balance is taxable. (2)\nA person's residence is his permanent\nplace of abode, whether or not maintained by the person or another person for\nhim. Example 3: A homeowner has a garage sale and, in doing so, sells an\nold table and some chairs at his home. The homeowner is not in the furniture\nbusiness, the sale was for one day, and he sold the table and chairs for $100. The sale was exempt. Example 4: A group of neighbors decide to hold a community lawn sale\nat a common site. The receipts from the sale will be apportioned to the\nparticipants based on the items each furnishes. Since the sale is conducted by\na group and not by an individual, the sale is subject to tax regardless of the\namount or the duration of the sale. (b) Sales subject to tax in all\ncases. (1)\n\nThis exemption shall not\napply to sales at a private residence conducted by an auctioneer, sheriff or\nany other third party.
