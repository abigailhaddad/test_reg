  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-5.6 - Periodical estimates for partial payment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Scope of instructions. The instructions herein with respect to the preparation\nof a periodical estimate for partial payment and supporting documents are\nlimited to the accounting features only and no procedures are included\nregarding the method of determining the quantities of work performed and the\namounts due therefor. The latter are properly the province of the technical\nstaffs of the local agency and the contractor, the architect, and the State's\nconstruction adviser. (b) Schedule of amounts for contract payments. Upon the award of a lumpsum contract covering more than\none of the types of work listed on the front side of the periodical estimate\nfor partial payment (Exhibit 13 of Appendix S-11), the contractor shall prepare\nfor the approval by the architect and the local agency a breakdown of the\ncontract price among the various types of work on forms DH-355A and DH-355B, Schedule of Amounts for Contract Payments, in an original and the required\nnumber of copies, as designated by the local agency. Forms DH-355A and 355-B\nare printed forms supplied by the division and are shown as Exhibits 11 and 12\nof Appendix S-11. The original shall be retained by the local agency and\ncopies, bearing the required signatures, shall be distributed to the\ncontractor, the architect or other person in the field authorized to approve\nperiodical estimates on behalf of the local agency, and to the State's\nconstruction adviser, for use in preparing and checking periodical estimates\nfor partial payments. The breakdown of the contract price is reflected in\ncolumn 6 of the Periodical Estimate for Partial Payment (form DH-356), as\ndescribed in subdivision (d) of this section. (c) Accounts payable voucher\nsupports. (1)\n\nThe accounts payable\nvoucher shall be supported by the originals of the following documents bearing\nthe required approvals: (i) Periodical\n\nEstimate for Partial Payment, form DH-356. (ii)\n\nSchedule of Change Orders, form DH-357\n(unless none issued). (iii)\n\nSchedule of Materials Stored, form DH-358A (unless no advance\nrequested). (iv)\n\nSummary of\n\nMaterials Stored, form DH-358B (unless no advance\nrequested). (2)\n\nAll the\nabove (see Exhibits 13 through 17 of Appendix S-11) are printed forms supplied\nby the division and shall be furnished by the local agency for use by\ncontractors in preparing and submitting periodical requests for partial\npayments on the value of work performed during specific periods and for\nadvances on account of materials stored on the site. The period to be included\nin a periodical estimate for partial payment shall, as a general rule, be a\ncalendar month. (3)\n\nThe contractor, after approval by his authorized representative of the original and the\nrequired number (as designated by the local agency) of copies of the periodical\nestimate and the related and supporting documents, shall obtain the\ncertification of the architect or other person in the field, authorized to do\nso on behalf of the local agency, and of the State's construction adviser, approving the work and the amount of the claim on the originals and all copies\nof the periodical estimate and supporting documents. The State's construction\nadviser shall retain a copy of the periodical estimate and supporting documents\nand the contractor shall transmit the originals and the required number of\ncopies to the local agency for payment. (d) Preparation of form DH-356, Periodical Estimate for Partial Payment. The preparation of the documents supporting a\n\nPeriodical Estimate for Partial Payment (form DH-356) will be described in\nsubsequent paragraphs. Specific instructions for preparing form DH-356, shown\nas Exhibits 11 and 12 of Appendix S-11, follow: (1)\n\nNumbering. The periodical estimates shall be numbered\nconsecutively by each contractor, beginning with no. 1 and continuing in\nsequence thereafter, notwithstanding the fact that in some months estimates may\nnot have been submitted. (2)\n\nColumn 3 (front side). This amount shall represent the value of work performed\non each item during the period covered by the periodical estimate and is the\ndifference between column 5 and column 4. (3)\n\nColumn 4 (front side). No entry can be made in this column for the first\nperiodical estimate; however, in succeeding months each item in column 5 from\nthe preceding periodical estimate shall be transcribed to column\n4. (4)\n\nColumn 5 (front\nside). In this column shall be entered amounts representing\nthe\ngross\nvalue of work in place for each item as at the\nclosing date of the periodical estimate. In no instance shall the amounts\nappearing in this column exceed the amounts of the same items shown in column\n6, (taken from form DH-355A and B, Schedule of Amounts for Contract\n\nPayments). (5)\n\nColumn 6\n(front side). Record in this column the identical amounts for each of\nthe numbered items on the approved Schedule of Amounts for Contract Payments, form DH-355A and B. The total of this column recorded on line A shall equal the\noriginal contract amount. (6)\n\nColumn 7 (front side). In this column shall be recorded an amount which is the\ndifference between column 6 and column 5, and the amount will represent the\nscheduled value of uncompleted work to date. (7)\n\nColumns 8 and 9 (front side). The \"Percent Completed-Period\" is determined by\ndividing column 3 by column 6. The \"Percent Completed- To Date\" is obtained by\ndividing column 5 by column 6. These percentages shall be computed to one place\nbeyond the decimal point. (8)\n\nLine A (front side). The amounts indicated thereunder are the column totals. It will be noted the total for column 6, original estimate, is the amount of\nthe original contract price and must be in agreement at all times with the\ntotal of the Schedule of Amounts for Contract Payments, form DH-355A and\nB. (9)\n\nLine B and C (front\nside). The total amount from column 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 of the\n\nSchedule of Change Orders, form DH-357, shall be appropriately recorded on\nthese lines, as indicated in the table under (11) below. (10)\n\nLine D (front side). This line for grand total is self-explanatory. (11)\n\nSource and disposition of\namounts entered on lines A through D (front side). The following table shows the source and the\ndisposition of the column amounts on lines A to D inclusive: Front side of periodical\nestimate\n\nSchedule of change\norders\n\nCertification of\ncontractor\n(Line)\n(Column)\n(Column)\n(Line)\nA\n5\n-\nto\n8\nA\n6\n-\nto\n1\nB\n3\nfrom\n4\n-\nB\n5\nfrom\n5\nto\n9\nB\n6\nfrom\n3\nto\n5\nC\n3\nfrom\n7\n-\nC\n5\nfrom\n8\nto\n10\nC\n6\nfrom\n6\nto\n6\nD\n5\n-\nto\n11\nD\n6\n-\nto\n7\n(12)\n\nCertification of contractor (reverse\nside). The certification on the reverse side includes the\nsummary of amounts used to determine the\nnet balance due. In\nthe first paragraph there shall be appropriately entered the name of the local\nagency, the name of the contractor and the date of contract. An explanation of\nentries for each line of the certification follows: (i) Line 1. This is the\noriginal contract price and shall agree with the total amount shown in line A, column 6 on the front of this form. (ii)\n\nLine 2. If, under the\ncontract, certain allowances are stipulated for such work as utility\nconnections and associated items, for which the cost could not be\npredetermined, the total amount of such allowances shall be entered here, and\nsuch amounts shall not be considered as eligible for payment until validated\nfor an appropriate amount as indicated on line 4 below. (iii)\n\nLine 3. The amount to\nbe shown here is the difference between line 1 and line 2. (iv)\n\nLine 4. Enter on this\nline the total value of only such allowances included in line 2 as have been\nvalidated. The amount to be entered here is the original amount of the\nallowance; additions or deductions in connection with such validations will be\nreflected in change orders. (v) Line 5. On this line shall be entered the total amount of\nadditions\non issued change orders. The amount shall be the\ntotal of column 3 on the schedule of change orders and line B, column 6 on the\nfront of this form. (vi)\n\nLine 6. Enter on this line the total amount of\ndeductions\non issued change orders and line C, column 6 on the\nfront of this form. The\nnet\naddition or deduction, plus line\n4, shall be extended into the right-hand column. (vii)\n\nLine 7. The amount\nobtained by computing the difference between line 3 and line 6 will establish\nthe\ncurrent adjusted contract amount. (viii)\n\nLine 8. From the\nfront of this form, the amount shown in line A, column 5 (value of work\nperformed to date) shall be entered. (ix)\n\nLine 9. Enter on this\nline that portion of the total value of issued change order\nadditions, completed to date. The amount shall be the amount\nshown in column 5 of the schedule of change orders and line C. column 5 on the\nfront of this form. (x) Line 10. Enter on this line that portion of the total value of\nissued change order\ndeductions, deductible to date. The amount\nshall be the amount shown in column 8 of the schedule of change orders and line\nC, column 5 on the front of this form. (xi)\n\nLine 11. The\ntotal value of work performed to date\nis determined by adding\nline 8 and line 9, minus line 10. This amount shall be in agreement with line\nD, column 5 on the front of this form. (xii)\n\nLine 12. Enter on this\nline the percentage of the amount representing the value of work performed to\ndate to be retained and record the amount retained in the right-hand column. See section\n1646-5.5\nin this\nconnection. (xiii)\n\nLine\n13. This amount is determined by subtracting line 12 from line\n11. (xiv)\n\nLine 14. The amount to be entered on this line is brought forward from line 13 on the\npreviously approved periodical estimate. (xv)\n\nLine 15. This amount is\ndetermined by subtracting line 14 from line 13. (xvi)\n\nLine 16. In preparing\nestimates for partial payments to the contractor, the value of materials\ndelivered to the site may be taken into consideration. Enter on this line the\nnet amount\nof materials stored as shown on the Summary of\n\nMaterials Stored, form DH-358B. (xvii)\n\nLine 17. The amount\nto be entered on this line is to be brought forward from line 16 on the\nprevious periodical estimate. (xviii)\n\nLine 18. The amount\nto be entered on this line is determined by computing the difference between\nline 16 and line 17. The amount shown on line 16, representing the allowance\nfor materials stored as shown on previous estimate, must be liquidated in full\non each succeeding estimate and will result in an addition or a deduction from\nthe amount on line 15 in determining the balance due this payment on line\n19. (xix)\n\nLine 19. The amount to be entered on this line is computed by adding (or subtracting)\nline 15 and line 18 and represents the\nnet amount\ndue the\ncontractor for the current periodical estimate. (xx)\n\nPrior to the submission of the first\nperiodical estimate, the contractor shall forward to the local agency a letter\nstating the name and title of officer, or employee, or/and their alternates, authorized in its behalf to submit, approve and certify periodical estimates. The certificate provides space in the last paragraph for the insertion of the\ncontractor's name and the signature of the authorized representative of the\ncontractor. (13)\n\nCertificate of architect. This block is headed, \"Certificate\" and appears\nimmediately beneath the certificate of the contractor. It is to be\nappropriately completed by the architect, or his authorized representative, before transmittal to the local agency for payment, where the architect, under\nhis contract, inspects and supervises the construction work. Should the local\nagency itself inspect and supervise the construction work performed in lieu of\nthe architect, the authorized field representative of the local agency shall\nsign in this block. (14)\n\nCertificate of owner. This block shall be appropriately completed by the\nlocal agency and signed by the executive officer of the person designated by\nthe board of the authority, before payment is made to the\ncontractor. (15)\n\nApproval of\n\nDivision of Housing. Provision has been made in the certificate of architect\nblock for the approval of the periodical estimate by the State's construction\nadviser or other authorized representative of the division. Such approval shall\nbe obtained after all other approvals have been obtained and prior to payment\nby the local agency. (e) Schedule of change orders. (1)\n\nForm DH-357, Schedule of Change Orders, is a printed form supplied by the division and is shown as Exhibit 15 of\n\nAppendix S-11. Supplies of this form shall be furnished by the local agency to\nthe contractor for use in preparing periodical estimates. Every Periodical\n\nEstimate for Partial Payment (form DH-356) shall be supported by a schedule of\nchange orders, in an original and the required number of copies, unless no\nchange orders have been issued since the award of the contract. The fact that\nno change orders have been issued during the period covered by a given\nperiodical estimate will not remove the necessity for supporting the periodical\nestimate with a schedule of change orders. (2)\n\nIt will be noted on the specimen form of\nDH-357 (Exhibit 15 of Appendix S-11) that provision has been made for an\nanalysis, in summary form, of the adjusted contract amount, to date. Only the\ntotal\ncolumn of this analysis shall be completed, and the\ndistribution to dwelling facilities and non-dwelling facilities shall be\ndisregarded. (f) Advances to contractors for materials stored at site. (1)\n\nWhen the conditions of a contract so\nprovide, an advance of funds may be made to the contractor for materials\nsuitably stored at the site of the project proper by him of\n[\nsic\n] his subcontractors to the extent of 90 per cent of their\nvalue. (2)\n\nIn the event the\ncontractor applies for such an advance, a Schedule of Materials Stored, form\nDH-358A, shall be prepared by him and submitted as a supporting document of the\nperiodical estimate for partial payment, such form bearing the signature of the\nperson or persons preparing and checking the inventory. This form and form\nDH-358B, Summary of Materials Stored, are printed forms supplied by the\ndivision and are shown as Exhibits 16 and 17 of Appendix S-11. (3)\n\nThe contractor and his subcontractors in\npreparing this schedule shall submit separate listings and total values of\nmaterials, which shall be identified by, and keyed with, the items shown on the\n\nSchedule of Amounts for Contract Payments (form DH-355). (4)\n\nThe unit price as scheduled shall not\nexceed the net purchase price as reflected by invoices or the amounts for\nmaterials set forth in the Schedule of Amounts for Contract Payments (form\nDH-355), whichever is applicable. Unit prices of materials stored are required, except in instances where materials are invoiced at a lump sum price. In such\ncases full explanation is necessary. (5)\n\nThe local agency shall require that: (i) the total value of materials stored, plus\n(ii)\nan adequate estimated\nallowance for labor costs to cover installation, plus\n(iii)\nthe value of work in place as reported\non the current estimate, shall not exceed the approved total amount of the\nparticular item as reflected in the schedule of amounts for contract\npayments. (6)\n\nIt is\nsuggested that the inventory be limited to items of consequential value and a\nminimum for particular items be fixed by the local agency. (7)\n\nThe amount allowed monthly for materials\nstored shall not be cumulative. The inventory previously allowed shall be\ndeducted in full on line 17, of each estimate, and the amount of the new\ninventory entered on line 16 on reverse side of estimate. (8)\nA summary of amounts as detailed in the\n\nSchedule of Materials Stored, from DH-358A, shall be recorded on Summary of\n\nMaterials Stored, form DH-358B, and grouped so as to identify the materials of\nthe contractor and each subcontractor, and in each case keyed with the\nappropriate item numbers. There shall be allowed for such stored materials 90\nper cent of its established value and the net amount only, shall be carried to\nthe periodical estimate on line 16. No retention shall be established with\nthese allowances, as the amount first allowed will be deducted in full in each\nsucceeding estimate. (9)\n\nThe\ncertificate provided at the bottom of the summary of materials stored shall be\nproperly executed by the authorized representative of the local\nagency. (10)\n\nThe net amount of the\nadvance shall be included in the amount charged to account 1400, Development\n\nCosts, and a record thereof shall be made in the contractors ledger, all as\ndescribed in section\n1646-5.4. (g) Advances to contractors for\nmaterials stored off the site. Under certain special circumstances, advances may be\nmade to contractors for materials stored off the site of the project proper. Local agencies are requested to apply to the division for the appropriate\nforms, instructions, and authorizations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
