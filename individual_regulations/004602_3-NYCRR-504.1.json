  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 504.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Department of Financial Services (the \"Department\") has\nbeen involved in investigations into compliance by Regulated Institutions, as\ndefined below, with applicable Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering laws and\nregulations\n1\n(\"BSA/AML\") and Office of Foreign\n\nAssets Control of the Treasury Department (\"OFAC\")\n2\nrequirements implementing federal economic and trade\nsanctions. 3\n\nAs a result of these investigations, the Department\nidentified shortcomings in the transaction monitoring and filtering programs of\nthese institutions attributable to a lack of robust governance, oversight, and\naccountability at senior levels. Based on not only this experience, but also\nits regular examinations for safety and soundness, along with other factors, the Department has reason to believe that financial institutions have\nshortcomings in their transaction monitoring and filtering programs. As a result, the Department has determined to clarify the\nrequired attributes of a Transaction Monitoring and Filtering Program and to\nrequire that the Board of Directors or Senior Officer(s), as applicable, of\neach Regulated Institution submit to the Superintendent annually a Board\n\nResolution or Compliance Finding, as defined in this Part, confirming the steps\ntaken to ascertain compliance by the Regulated Institution with this\n\nPart. This regulation implements these\nrequirements. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n504.1\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register July 20, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 29, eff. 1/1/2017\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
