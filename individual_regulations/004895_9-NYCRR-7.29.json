[*]\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, on April 26, 2009, the Secretary of the United\n\nStates Department of Health and Human Services determined that a public health\nemergency involving 2009 H1N1 influenza exists nationwide, which determination\nwas renewed by the Secretary on July 24, 2009 and October 1, 2009; and\nWHEREAS, on June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization\ndeclared that 2009 H1N1 influenza had spread around the world to the point\nwhere it is now a pandemic; and\nWHEREAS, on October 23, 2009, President Barack Obama\ndeclared a national emergency pursuant to sections 201 and 202 of the National\n\nEmergencies Act (50\nU.S.C. 1621, et seq.) given that the rapid\nincrease in illness across the nation may overburden health care resources, and\nauthorized the Secretary of Health and Human Services to exercise the authority\nunder section 1135 of the Social Security Act to waive or modify certain\nrequirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance\nprograms and of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act Privacy\n\nRule as necessary to respond to the pandemic; and\nWHEREAS, 2009 H1N1 influenza is widespread throughout the\n\nState of New York, with at least 75 known deaths including among children and\npregnant women, but the true magnitude of cases may be as much as 10 percent of\nthe population or more in some areas; and\nWHEREAS, there is evidence that the spread of 2009 H1N1\ninfluenza is increasing in schools; and\nWHEREAS, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic is a threat to\npublic health and safety in New York and, if unchecked, will cause personal\nhardship among the general public throughout the State, including death, hospital overcrowding, shortages of health care workers, and disruptions to\nbusinesses and critical infrastructure due to illness-related absenteeism; and\nWHEREAS, the seriousness of the 2009 H1N1 influenza\npandemic, compounded by the concurrent presence in the community of seasonal\ninfluenza disease, constitutes a public health emergency; and\nWHEREAS, Public Health Law sections 206(1)(l) and 613(1)\nauthorize the New York State Department of Health and local heath departments, respectively, to establish and conduct programs for the voluntary immunization\nof adults and the immunization of children with parental consent to prevent or\nminimize the spread of disease and to protect the public health; WHEREAS, among the factors contributing to the imminence\nand seriousness of the public health emergency are a shortage of nurses and\nother trained and licensed personnel able to administer vaccinations to as many\npeople and as quickly as possible, potentially causing hospitals, clinics and\nother health care providers to be overwhelmed by excessive number of\nindividuals seeking vaccination and patients who become ill with 2009 H1N1\ninfluenza or seasonal influenza; and\nWHEREAS, to combat the further spread of 2009 H1N1\ninfluenza, avoid excessive disruptions to the health care system and society in\ngeneral, and protect the lives, health, safety and welfare of the public, it is\nnecessary to remove or minimize barriers to the voluntary vaccination of as\nmany individuals as possible as quickly as possible against 2009 H1N1 influenza\nand seasonal influenza, by making available the services, personnel, equipment, and facilities necessary to conduct such vaccinations and facilitating the\ntimely and accurate reporting of vaccinations;

and\nWHEREAS, health professionals licensed or certified under\nthe Education Law or the Public Health Law are authorized to engage in specific\nscopes of practice, and this Order shall not expand the scopes of practice of\nthese professionals to allow them routinely to administer vaccinations, but\nrather will allow them to vaccinate only under the extremely limited\ncircumstances described in and for the duration of this Order; and\nWHEREAS, records maintained in the New York State\n\nImmunization Information System (NYSIIS) and the New York City Citywide\n\nImmunization Registry (CIR) are securely maintained and may be disclosed only\nas provided in law, and this Order shall not alter any existing provision for\nthe security or confidentiality of immunization information; and\nWHEREAS, this Order does not authorize any person to be\nvaccinated without his or her consent or the consent of another person legally\nauthorized to consent on his or her behalf, and does not authorize any minor to\nbe vaccinated without the consent of a person in parental relation to the\nminor;
