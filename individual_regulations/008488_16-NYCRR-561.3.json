  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 561.3 - Numbering system\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The account\nnumbering scheme used herein consists of a system of three-digit whole numbers\nas follows: Assets and Other Debits. Liabilities and Other Credits. Plant Accounts. Income Accounts. Retained Earnings Accounts. Revenue Accounts. Production, Transmission and Distribution\n\nExpenses. Customer Accounts, Sales and General Administrative\n\nExpenses. (b) In certain\ninstances, numbers have been skipped in order to allow for possible later\nexpansion or to permit better coordination with the numbering system for other\nutility departments. (c) The\nnumbers prefixed to account titles are to be considered as part of the titles. Each utility, however, may adopt for its own purposes a different system of\naccount numbers (see also general instruction 561.2, subd. [d]) provided that\nthe numbers herein prescribed shall appear in the descriptive headings of the\nledger accounts and in the various sources of original entry; however, if a\nutilty used a different group of account numbers and it is not practicable to\nshow the prescribed account numbers in the various sources of original entry, such reference to the prescribed account numbers may be omitted from the\nvarious sources of original entry. Moreover, each utility using different\naccount numbers for its own purposes shall keep readily available a list of\nsuch account numbers which it uses and a reconciliation of such account numbers\nwith the account numbers provided herein. It is intended that the utility's\nrecords shall be so kept to permit ready analysis by prescribed accounts (by\ndirect reference to sources of original entry to the extent practicable) and to\npermit preparation of financial and operating statements directly from such\nrecords at the end of each accounting period according to the prescribed\naccounts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n561.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
