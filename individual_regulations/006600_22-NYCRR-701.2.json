  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 701.2 - Exercise of the summary contempt power\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The power of the court to punish\nsummarily any contempt committed in its immediate view and presence shall be\nexercised only in exceptional and necessitous circumstances, as follows: (1)\n\nWhere the offending\nconduct disrupts or threatens to disrupt proceedings actually in progress; or\n(2)\nwhere the\noffending conduct destroys or undermines or tends seriously to destroy or\nundermine the dignity and authority of the court in a manner and to the extent\nthat it appears unlikely that the court will be able to continue to conduct its\nnormal business in an appropriate way, provided that in either case the court\nreasonably believes that a prompt summary adjudication of contempt may aid in\nmaintaining or restoring and maintaining proper order and decorum. (b) Wherever\npractical, punishment should be determined and imposed at the time of the\nadjudication of contempt. However, where the court deems it advisable the\ndetermination and imposition of punishment may be deferred following a prompt\nsummary adjudication of contempt which satisfies the necessity for immediate\njudicial corrective or disciplinary action. (c) Before any summary adjudication of\ncontempt the accused shall be given a reasonable opportunity to make a\nstatement in his defense or in extenuation of his conduct. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\n§\n701.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
