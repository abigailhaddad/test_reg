  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 837.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adapted\nfrom that used by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation\nin its biological survey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The\nprimary waters of a drainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually\nreferred to by name or an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are\nconsecutively numbered progressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are\nnumbered consecutively as they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by\nthe letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as\nthey enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or\nmouth. When isolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for convenience of their identification and location within a\nsubdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being\ntributary to any waters to which no surface connection is shown on the\nreference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was\napplied to the basin under consideration by the Department of Environmental\n\nConservation in its biological survey of the Lake Erie -Niagara River watershed\nin 1928 and has been closely followed in connection with the identification of\nthe waters with the following exceptions: Some of the stream numbers do not run\nconsecutively due to the omission of streams originally shown on older maps\nemployed by the Department of Environmental Conservation at the time of its\n1928 survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few\nstreams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the newer maps are\ndesignated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Lake Erie (east end) - Niagara River drainage\nbasin may be illustrated as follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\n0\n\nLake Ontario\n\nPrimary waters. 0-158\n\nNiagara River\n\nThe 158th tributary of Lake Ontario numbering\nconsecutively clockwise from the mouth at Tibbetts Point. 0-158-3\n\nFish Creek\n\nThe 3rd tributary entering Niagara River upstream\nfrom its mouth. E\nLake Erie\n\nPrimary waters. E-1\n\nBuffalo River\n\nThe 1st tributary of Lake Erie numbered\nconsecutively clockwise from its outlet at the Niagara River. E-13\n\nEighteenmile Creek\n\nThe 13th tributary of Lake Erie numbered\nconsecutively clockwise from its outlet at the Niagara River. E-13-4\n\nSouth Branch Eighteenmile Creek\n\nThe 4th tributary entering Eighteenmile Creek\nupstream from its mouth. E-13-4-P 83\n\nUnnamed pond\n\nThe 83rd pond, lake or reservoir encountered in the\nbiological survey area of the Lake Erie-Niagara River watershed, and\nspecifically located in the drainage basin of South Branch Eighteenmile\n\nCreek. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary\nand\nsubtributaries, respectively, shall mean any stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water\nwhich flows into any other stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond or other body of\nsurface water referenced by such waters index number; where tributaries or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface\nwater referenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and\nsubtributaries thereof, which are shown on the reference maps, unless\nexceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically designated\nwaters are generally known and which may appear on the reference maps. In cases\nof specifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to\nwhich the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I shall mean a brief\nindication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries\nmay include designations of sections of waters to which a particular assignment\nof a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also include any useful\ninformation pertinent to the classification and standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as\nappearing in table I means map reference number and indicates one or more of\nthe following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on which\nthe specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown. The\nfollowing maps were produced from original maps which may be procured through\nthe Washington Distribution Section, Geological Survey. Map Ref.

(h) Standards\nas appearing\nin table I, and denoted by the letters A, A-special (International boundary\nwaters), B or C opposite each specifically designated waters shall mean the\nstandards of quality and purity established for class A, A-special\n(International boundary waters), B or C, as the case may be, as set forth in\n\nPart 701 and 702, supra. The symbol (T) appearing after any\nstandard designation shall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and\nthat the dissolved oxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol (TS) after any standard designation shall mean that the designated\nwaters are suitable for trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen\nspecification for trout spawning waters shall apply thereto. (i) The term\ntrout\nas used\nin this Part means any fish in the following genera: \"Coregonus\", \"Oncorhynchus\", \"Prosopium\", \"Salmo\", \"Salvelinus\" and \"Thymallus\". (j) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich appear as lines to indicate natural waters on the reference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated in table I, shall be assigned the\nsame classes and standards of quality and purity as the specifically designated\nwaters to which they are directly tributary. (k) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standards as the waters to which it is\ndirectly tributary. (l) The Lake\n\nErie (east end) - Niagara River drainage basin shall be deemed to include the\nfollowing areas: All land and water areas, the natural surface water drainage\nfrom which is directly or indirectly tributary to Lake Erie (east end) and the\n\nNiagara River.
