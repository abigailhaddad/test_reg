  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 400.3 - Limits on executive compensation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Limits on\nexecutive compensation. Except if a covered provider has obtained a waiver\npursuant to section\n400.4\nof this Part, a covered\nprovider as defined in this regulation shall not use State funds or\n\nState-authorized payments for executive compensation given directly or\nindirectly to a covered executive in an amount greater than $199,000 per annum, provided, however, that the department shall review this figure annually to\ndetermine whether adjustment is necessary based on appropriate factors and\nsubject to the approval of the Director of the Division of the Budget. Commencing on July 1, 2013, the limits on executive compensation pursuant to\nthis Part shall be effective and applicable to each covered provider on the\nfirst day of each covered provider's respective covered reporting\nperiod. (b) Except if a covered\nprovider has obtained a waiver pursuant to section\n400.4\nof this Part, where a covered\nprovider's executive compensation given to a covered executive is greater than\n$199,000 per annum (including not only State funds and State-authorized\npayments but also any other sources of funding), and either: (1)\ngreater than the 75th percentile of that\ncompensation provided to comparable executives in other providers of the same\nsize and within the same program service sector and the same or comparable\ngeographic area as established by a compensation survey identified, provided, or recognized by the department and the Director of the Division of the Budget, or\n(2)\nwas not reviewed and\napproved by the covered provider's board of directors or equivalent governing\nbody (if such a board or body exists) including at least two independent\ndirectors or voting members (or, where a duly authorized compensation committee\nincluding at least two independent directors or voting members conducted such\nreview on behalf of the full board, such actions were not reviewed and ratified\nby such board), or such review did not include an assessment of appropriate\ncomparability data. then such covered provider shall be subject to the penalties\nset forth in section\n400.6\nof this Part. To determine\nwhether a covered provider may be subject to penalties, such provider shall\nprovide, upon request by the department or its designee, contemporaneous\ndocumentation in a form and level of detail sufficient to allow such\ndetermination to be made. (c) Program services rendered by covered\nexecutives. The limit on executive compensation pursuant to this section shall\nnot be applied to limit reimbursement with State funds or State-authorized\npayments for reasonable compensation paid to a covered executive for program\nservices, including but not limited to supervisory services performed to\nfacilitate the covered provider's program services, rendered by the executive\noutside of his or her managerial or policy-making duties. Documentation of such\nprogram services rendered shall be used by the covered provider to determine\nthat percentage, if any, of the covered executive's compensation that is\nattributable to program services and that compensation shall not be considered\nin the calculation of his or her executive compensation. Such documentation\nshall be maintained and provided to the department or its designee upon\nrequest. Clinical and program personnel in a hospital or other entity providing\nprogram services, including chairs of departments, heads of service, chief\nmedical officers, directors of nursing, or similar types of personnel\nfulfilling administrative functions that are nevertheless directly attributable\nto and comprise program services shall not be considered covered executives for\npurposes of limiting the use of State funds or State-authorized payments to\ncompensate them. (d) Covered\nproviders with multiple sources of State funds or State-authorized payments. If\na covered provider receives State funds or State-authorized payments from\nmultiple sources, the provider's compliance with the limits on executive\ncompensation in subdivision (a) of this section shall be determined based upon\nthe total amount of such funding received and the reimbursements received from\nall sources of State funds or State-authorized payments. As set forth in\nsection\n400.5\nof this Part, the covered\nprovider shall report all of such State funds and State-authorized payments in\nthe form specified by the department or its designee. (e) Subcontractors and agents of covered\nproviders. The limits on executive compensation in subdivision (a) and (b) of\nthis section and the reporting requirements in section\n400.5\nof this Part shall apply to\nsubcontractors and agents of covered providers if and to the extent that such a\nsubcontractor or agent has received State funds or State-authorized payments\nfrom the covered provider to provide program or administrative services during\nthe reporting period and would otherwise meet the definition of a covered\nprovider but for the fact that it has received State funds or State-authorized\npayments from the covered provider rather than directly from a governmental\nagency. A covered provider shall incorporate into its agreement with such a\nsubcontractor or agent the terms of these regulations by reference to require\nand facilitate compliance. Upon request, covered providers shall promptly\nreport to the funding or authorizing agency the identity of such subcontractors\nand agents, along with any other information requested by that agency or by the\ndepartment or its designee. A covered provider shall not be held responsible\nfor a subcontractor's or agent's failure to comply with these\nregulations. (f) Covered providers\nreceiving State funds or State-authorized payments from county or local\ngovernment or entity contracting on its behalf. The department or its designee, rather than the county or local unit of government or entity contracting on\nbehalf of such government, shall be responsible for obtaining the necessary\nreporting from and compliance by such covered providers, and shall issue\nguidance to affected county and local governments to set forth the procedures\nby which the department or it designee shall do so. (g) Other limits on executive compensation. If the contract, grant, or other agreement is subject to more stringent limits\non executive compensation, whether through law or contract, such limits shall\ncontrol and shall not be affected by the less stringent limits imposed by these\nregulations. However, the definition and interpretation of terms in this Part\nshall not be affected or limited by the definition or interpretation of terms\nin other regulations or agreements. (h) A covered provider's contracts or other\nagreements with a covered executive agreed to prior to July 1, 2012 shall not\nbe subject to the limits in this section during the term of the contract, except that: (1)\ncovered providers must apply\nfor a waiver for any contracts or agreements with covered executives for\nexecutive compensation that exceeds or otherwise fails to comply with these\nregulations if such contracts or agreements extend beyond April 1, 2015; and\n(2)\nrenewals of such contracts\nor agreements after the completion of their term must comply with these\nregulations.
