  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-2.13 - Brokerage commissions\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A(5)(b)(1))\n(a) In the case of a registered securities\nbroker or dealer, receipts constituting brokerage commissions derived from the\nexecution of purchase or sale orders for securities or commodities for\ncustomers shall be deemed to be generated within New York State if the\ncorporation's records indicate the mailing address of the customer who is\nresponsible for paying such commissions is in New York State. (b) Example. Broker X earns $10,000 in brokerage commission income\nfrom investment advisor Y to execute trades for investment fund Z. Investment\nadvisor Y is responsible for paying the commission to Broker X but passes on\nthe brokerage commission expense to its investors in the form of fees. Broker\nX's records indicate that the mailing address of investment advisor Y is within\n\nNew York State and investment fund Z's mailing address is in state A. Because\n\nInvestment advisor Y is the customer responsible for paying the brokerage\ncommission to Broker X and its mailing address in Broker X's records is in New\n\nYork State, $10,000 is included in both New York receipts and everywhere\nreceipts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n4-2.13\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
