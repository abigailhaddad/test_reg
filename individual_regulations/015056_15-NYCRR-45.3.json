  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 45.3 - Construction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each red\nemergency reflector warning device shall be comprised of a multiplicity of red\nreflecting elements on each side, not less than two, front and back. Every red\nreflecting element shall conform, as a minimum requirement, to the\nspecifications for Class A reflex reflectors contained in the S.A.E. Handbook, 1943 edition (published by the Society of Automotive Engineers). The aggregate\ncandle-power output of the reflecting elements of the device when tested in a\nperpendicular position at one-third degree as specified by S.A.E. photometric\nprocedure shall be not less than 12. (b) Each reflector element shall be not less\nthan three inches in diameter. (c) If the reflecting surfaces of the reflector elements may be adversely affected\nby dust, soot, water or other foreign matters, they must be adequately sealed\nwithin the body of the units in which they are incorporated. Each reflector\ndevice shall be of such weight construction and/or dimensions as to remain\nstable, upright and stationary in a 40-mile-per-hour wind on any type road\nsurface or level on which it is likely to be used. Such device shall be so\nconstructed as to withstand reasonable shock without breakage. Each reflector\nmust be so constructed that the reflecting elements are in a plane\nperpendicular to the plane of the roadway when placed thereon. (d) Reasonable protection shall be afforded\neach reflecting device and the reflecting elements incorporated therein, by\nenclosure in a box container or rack from which the devices may be extracted\nfor use. In the event the reflector devices are collapsible, locking means\nshall be provided to maintain the reflector elements in effective position\nwhile in use, and such locking means shall be readily capable of adjustment\nwithout the use of tools or specific equipment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n45.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
