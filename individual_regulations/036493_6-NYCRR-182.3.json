  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 182.3 - Listing of endangered and threatened species\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Coordinated listing. All native species\npresent or formerly present in New York listed as endangered or threatened by\nthe United States Department of the Interior in the Code of Federal Regulations\n(50 CFR part\n17\n) will be included on New York's list of endangered or\nthreatened species in this Part. (b) General criteria for listing. The\ndepartment will consider one or more of the following factors when determining\nwhether a species should be listed as endangered or threatened in New York: (1)\nwhether the current number of viable and\nself-sustaining populations of the species statewide is sufficient to ensure\ncontinued survival of the species in the State; (2)\nwhether the total number of reproducing\nindividuals is currently sufficient to ensure continued survival of the species\nin the State; (3)\nwhether the\nspecies is designated as a federal candidate species under the Federal\n\nEndangered Species Act or is listed as endangered or threatened in three or\nmore adjacent states or provinces; (4)\nwhether the species has declined\nnon-cyclically throughout a significant portion of its range in the State or in\nthe United States. (5)\nwhether the\npresent or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailment of the species'\nhabitat or range within the State threatens the continued survival of the\nspecies in the State; (6)\nwhether\nthe overuse of the species for commercial, sporting, scientific, educational, or other purpose threatens the continued survival of the species in the\n\nState; (7)\nwhether disease, pollution, contaminants, predation, or interspecific competition threatens the\ncontinued survival of the species in the State; (8)\nthe adequacy of existing regulatory\nmechanisms to protect the species or its habitat; (9)\nother natural or human-made factors\naffecting the species' continued survival within the State; (10)\nwhether the species is restricted\ngeographically in the State; and\n(11)\nwhether the species' biology makes it\nhighly susceptible to changes in its environment. (c) Additional criteria for listing. Only\nspecies native to New York and existing in the wild within the State with some\nregularity during a portion of its annual life cycle will be considered for\nlisting by the department as endangered or threatened. Species that are exotic, or were deliberately or accidentally introduced into New York, the United\n\nStates, or North America by humans, or are vagrant or an accidental visitor\nwill not be considered for listing. Currently extirpated species are eligible\nfor listing by the department as endangered or threatened if the species is\ndocumented to have been native in New York, and if suitable habitat for the\nspecies remains or could be created. (d) Criteria for de-listing. A species will\nbe removed from the list of endangered species and added to the list of\nthreatened species in New York when, after applying the factors set forth in\nsubdivision (b) of this section, the department determines that the species no\nlonger qualifies for listing as endangered. A species will be removed from the\nlist of threatened species and added to the list of species of special concern\nin New York when, after applying the factors set forth in subdivision (b) of\nthis section, the department determines that the species no longer qualifies\nfor listing as threatened.
