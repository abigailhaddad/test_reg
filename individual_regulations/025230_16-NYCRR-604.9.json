  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 604.9 - Special conditions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This\nsection governs the new construction of distribution and feeder facilities\nperformed pursuant to this Part. (b) In unusual circumstances when the\napplication of this Part appears impracticable or unjust to either party or\ndiscriminatory to other customers, the utility providing service or the\napplicant may file a petition, in accordance with the requirements of section\n3.5\nof this Title, for a special\nruling or for the approval of special conditions which may be mutually agreed\nupon before construction is commenced, which petition shall set forth relevant\neconomic, engineering, and environmental factors. (c) If the utility or the applicant believes\nthat the new construction of underground distribution or feeder facilities\nwithin a residential subdivision would be less environmentally desirable than\nthe new construction of overhead facilities, the utility or applicant may\nrequest that the secretary of the commission grant an exception. The request\nshall be sent to the secretary in accordance with the requirements of section\n3.5\nof this Title. The request\nshall: (1)\nas between overhead and underground\nconstruction, compare the probable environmental effects associated with the\nsubdivision and any economic, engineering, or other factors considered\npertinent to the case; (2)\nfor\nthose instances where visual values would be diminished by underground\nconstruction, indicate factors bearing on probable retention of significant\nflora (including the utility's practice with respect to trimming trees in a\nvicinity of the overhead facilities); (3)\nbe mailed to the Adirondack Park Agency\nwhenever the request will involve construction within the Adirondack Park; and\n(4)\nbe reviewed by staff. The\nsecretary shall notify the utility within 60 days of receipt of the request\neither that the request is granted or that it objects to the request. If staff\nobjects, the request shall be referred to the commission for further review. Requests and petitions shall be granted or denied based on\nenvironmental, economic and engineering factors. (d) Service to a residential subdivision may\nbe supplied overhead if no governmental authority having jurisdiction to do so\nhas required underground installation and the utility can provide such service: (1)\nby extending its facilities no more than\n600 feet in a cul-de-sac where a portion of the street within the subdivision\nis served by overhead facilities within or at the entrance of the\ncul-de-sac; (2)\nby connecting an\narea between existing overhead facilities for a distance of 1,200 feet or\nless;[FN16]\n(3)\nby installing drop\nwires to new individual applicants for service from existing overhead\nfacilities; or\n(4)\nwhere a utility\nconstructs overhead facilities because of paragraph (1) or (2) of this\nsubdivision, it shall report such overhead construction to the commission\nquarterly, along with a description of the project; and\n(e) Where a one-pole extension (whether or\nnot it crosses a road) would enable an existing overhead distribution facility\nto be connected to a proposed distribution facility in a residential\nsubdivision, such extension may be installed overhead rather than underground; provided. [FN16] In order to determine whether 1,200 feet or more of\nfacilities must be constructed to connect existing overhead facilities, the\nmeasurement should be along the route of construction. This will usually be the\nstreet within the residential subdivision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n604.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
