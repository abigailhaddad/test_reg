  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6210.20 - Use of Automated Audit Tool\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Use of Automated Audit Tool\n(1)\n\nNotwithstanding the requirement of\n6210.18 that the post-election audit shall be a \"manual\" or \"hand\" count, a\nboard of elections may use an automated audit tool approved by the state board\nof elections pursuant to subdivision one of section\n9-211\nof the\n\nElection Law, to perform a machine-assisted audit in accordance with the\nsubstantive requirements of 6210.18. Machine-assisted audit results shall then\nstand in place of the manual count for all audit purposes. The configuration of\nsuch audit tool for use in a machine-assisted audit shall be done in a\nbipartisan manner, or may be done by an independent third party, subject to\nbipartisan review and validation. Such ballot configuration shall include\npre-election test processes, pursuant to Part 6210.8 of these\nregulations. (b) Definitions\n\nFor purposes of this section: (1)\n\"Automated audit tool\" shall mean\nsoftware, device or other similar product which is developed without access to\nproprietary election management software or hardware, and is based upon\nseparate software that is programed separate and apart from any election\nmanagement software that is used to configure ballots and tabulate votes as\ncast on certified voting systems. (2)\n\"Machine-assisted audit\" shall mean an\naudit pursuant to 6210.18 utilizing automated tools approved for county board\nuse by the state board, to rescan ballots, then comparing audit tool results to\nthose produced from voting system results media, and which further requires the\nmanual comparison of some paper ballots or voter-verified paper audit records\nto the corresponding Cast Vote Records produced by the audit tool to ensure a\nhuman-observable check of vote tabulation which does not depend upon any voting\nsystem's hardware or software component. (3)\n\"Rescanned ballot\" shall mean a paper\nballot that is scanned and interpreted by the audit tool. (4)\n\"Cast Vote Record\" shall mean the audit\ntool's interpretation of the votes cast on a rescanned ballot. (c) Confirmation of\n\nMachine-Assisted Audit Accuracy\n(1)\n\nTo provide\na human-observable check of the vote tabulation accuracy of the audit tool, a\nrandom sample of rescanned ballots shall be selected. For each rescanned ballot\nin the sample, the votes shall be manually interpreted, and these manual\ninterpretations shall be compared to the audit tool interpretations of votes on\nthat ballot. (2)\n\nThe requisite\nnumber of rescanned ballots to be manually compared: Number of Rescanned Ballots\n\nNumber of Manually Compared Ballots\n<= 2,500\n25\n2,501 - 5,000\n32\n5,001 - 7,500\n39\n7,501 - 10,000\n46\n10,001 - 20,000\n56\n20,001 - 30,000\n66\n30,001 - 40,000\n76\n40,001 - 50,000\n86\n50,001 - 60,000\n96\n60,001 - 70,000\n106\n70,001 - 80,000\n116\n80,001 - 90,000\n126\n90,001 - 100,000\n136\n\nIf the number of rescanned ballots exceeds 100,000 the number\nto be manually compared shall be 136 plus.05% (.0005) of the number of machine\nassisted audited ballots in excess of 100,000. (3)\n\nBefore the random selection of ballots to\nbe manually compared, a computer-readable file of audit tool Cast Vote Records\n(CVR), representing all rescanned ballots, shall be produced in a commonly\navailable format such as comma-separated value (CSV), such that each CVR can be\nassociated with the corresponding paper ballot. This file, along with the vote\ntotals for each audited machine as produced by the audit tool, and any\ndocumentation needed to interpret the contents, shall be made available to a\nwatcher upon request on a physical medium. (4)\n\nThe county board of elections shall, as\nrequired by Part 6210.18(b), provide notification of the random selection of\nballots to be manually compared. (5)\n\nThe rescanned ballots to be compared\nshall be randomly selected from the total number of rescanned ballots in the\ncounty. Such random selections shall be made by a random number generator or\nsuch other process approved by the state board. The selection shall be based on\na sequential number assigned to each rescanned ballot reflecting the order in\nwhich the ballot is reviewed by the independent automated tool. (6)\n\nThe results of the comparisons between\naudit tool vote counts and voting system results, and of the manual comparison\nbetween paper ballots and audit tool CVRs, including a full description and\nexplanation of any discrepancies found, shall be reported to the state board of\nelections and shall accompany the certified election results. In explaining\ndiscrepancies between audit tool vote counts and voting system results, the\npaper ballots shall be examined, including a hand count of any batch for which\nany unexplained discrepancy is found. (7)\n\nThe expansion of any audit in which an\nautomated audit tool is used shall be based on the same criteria provided for\nin (e)(1) of 6210.18, taking into account both discrepancies found during the\nmanual comparison and discrepancies between the audit tool vote totals and the\ntotals reported by the voting system. Any expansion performed with an audit\ntool will be subject to similar observable manual comparison. (d) Implementation Procedures\n\nThe county board of elections shall adopt procedures based\nupon the State Board's standard post-election audit procedures for machine\nassisted audits no later than upon the completion of acceptance testing of any\nautomated audit tool, and such county-specific procedures shall be filed with\nthe state board of elections. Such specific procedures shall not take effect\nuntil approved by the state board of elections. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
