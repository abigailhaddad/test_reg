  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 5-1.22 - Approval of plans and completed works\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No supplier of water shall make, install or construct, or allow to be made, installed or constructed, a public water system or any addition or deletion to or modification of a public water system until the plans and specifications have been submitted to and approved by the State. Materials used in the design, construction and repair of a public water system shall be lead-free. For this Subpart, lead-free\nshall mean: (1)\nsolder or flux which contains no more than 0.2 percent lead; (2)\npipes, pipe fittings, plumbing fittings and fixtures which contain no more than a weighted average of 0.25 percent lead with respect to the wetted surfaces. The weighted average lead content of a pipe, pipe fitting, plumbing fitting, or fixture shall be calculated by using the following formula: For each wetted component, the percentage of lead is multiplied by the ratio of the wetted surface area of that component to the total wetted surface area of the entire product to arrive at the weighted percentage of lead of the component. The weighted percentage of lead of each wetted component is added together, and the sum of these weighted percentages constitutes the weighted average lead content of the product. The lead content of the material used to produce wetted components is used to determine compliance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision. For lead content of materials that are provided as a range, the maximum content of the range must be used for calculating the weighted average lead content. (b) Approval of plans and specifications for public water systems shall be based on the following standards in their entirety. The State may allow deviations from these standards in accordance with procedures established by the commissioner. (1)\n\nRecommended Standards for Water Works, (Appendix 5-A). (2)\n\nStandards for Water Wells\n(Appendix 5-B). (3)\n\nSpecial Requirements for Wells Serving Public Water Systems\n(Appendix 5-D). (c) The State may approve such plans or may require such modification which is deemed necessary to protect public health or safety. Application for plan approval shall be made on a form prescribed by the department. (d) A supplier of water shall receive the approval of the State before placing into service any public water system constructed under the requirements of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
