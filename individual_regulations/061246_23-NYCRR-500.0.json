  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 23 § 500.0 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe New York State Department of Financial Services (\"DFS\")\nhas been closely monitoring the evergrowing threat posed to information and\nfinancial systems by nation-states, terrorist organizations and independent\ncriminal actors. Recently, cybercriminals have sought to exploit technological\nvulnerabilities to gain access to sensitive electronic data. Cybercriminals can\ncause significant financial losses for DFS regulated entities as well as for\n\nNew York consumers whose private information may be revealed and/or stolen for\nillicit purposes. The financial services industry is a significant target of\ncybersecurity threats. DFS appreciates that many firms have proactively\nincreased their cybersecurity programs with great success. Given the seriousness of the issue and the risk to all\nregulated entities, certain regulatory minimum standards are warranted, while\nnot being overly prescriptive so that cybersecurity programs can match the\nrelevant risks and keep pace with technological advances. Accordingly, this\nregulation is designed to promote the protection of customer information as\nwell as the information technology systems of regulated entities. This\nregulation requires each company to assess its specific risk profile and design\na program that addresses its risks in a robust fashion. Senior management must\ntake this issue seriously and be responsible for the organization's\ncybersecurity program and file an annual certification confirming compliance\nwith these regulations. A regulated entity's cybersecurity program must ensure\nthe safety and soundness of the institution and protect its customers. It is critical for all regulated institutions that have not\nyet done so to move swiftly and urgently to adopt a cybersecurity program and\nfor all regulated entities to be subject to minimum standards with respect to\ntheir programs. The number of cyber events has been steadily increasing and\nestimates of potential risk to our financial services industry are stark. Adoption of the program outlined in these regulations is a priority for New\n\nYork State. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 23\n§\n500.0\n\nAdopted, New\n\nYork State Register March 1, 2017/Volume XXXIX, Issue 09, eff. 3/1/2017\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
