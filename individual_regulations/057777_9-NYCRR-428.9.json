  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 428.9 - Consultation process: public participation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The agency proposing the undertaking is\nresponsible, through the State Environmental Quality Review process or similar\nprocedures, for obtaining the views of the public concerning the\nundertaking. (b) At the\ncommencement of the consultation process, the APO shall confer with the\ncommissioner to establish a process for appropriate public notification and\nparticipation which may include public hearings at which representatives of\nlocal government and interested citizens may express their views on the\nundertaking or on any alternatives which would avoid or mitigate the adverse\nimpacts of the undertaking on eligible or registered properties. If it is\ndetermined that a public hearing is appropriate it should, whenever possible, be conducted concurrently with other public hearings which the undertaking\nagency might be required to hold under other provisions of law. If the\ncommissioner and the APO do not agree on the need for a public hearing or the\nadequacy of hearings held under other provisions of law either of them may\nunilaterally decide to conduct a public hearing. Notice of any public hearing\nheld pursuant to this section shall be given at least 15 days in advance of the\nhearing date. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n428.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
