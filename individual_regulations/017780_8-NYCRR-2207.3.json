The corporation shall provide an application, on forms prescribed\nby the president, to all institutions eligible to participate in the program\nunder this Title, such applications to be postmarked on or before the 15th day\nof May prior to the beginning of the academic year. Eligible institutions shall\nsubmit such completed applications to the corporation, postmarked on or before\nthe 15th day of June next following. (b) (1)\n\nAllocation. The State Education Department shall provide the enrollment data, upon which the institutional allocation of funds will be based, to the\ncorporation on or before the first day of May prior to the beginning of the\nacademic year. The corporation shall determine annual institutional allocation\npursuant to the provisions of section\n2207.2\n(b) of this\n\nPart, and notify institutions whose annual applications have been approved by\nthe corporation of the institutional allocation of funds on or before the first\nday of July next following. (2)\n\nReallocation. (i) In the event an institution\nforming a part of the State University of New York or the City University of\n\nNew York which was allocated funds for awards under this Part shall not expend\nthe entire amount of its allocation, the Chancellor of the State University of\n\nNew York or the Chancellor of the City University of New York, as the case may\nbe, may reallocate and distribute the unexpended portion to other participating\ninstitutions of such university. Written notification of such a reallocation by\nthe Chancellor of the State University of New York or the Chancellor of the\n\nCity University of New York shall be submitted by such chancellor, or such\nchancellor's designee, to the president within 30 days of the reallocation. No\nnotification of a reallocation, however, may be submitted to the president\nafter May 31st of the academic year. A notification of reallocation shall\ninclude the name of the institution having an unexpended portion of its\nallocation, the amount thereof, the name of the institution or institutions to\nwhom such portion was distributed, the date of such distribution, and the\namount each institution received. (ii)\n\nAny institution which shall receive an\nallocation for an award under this Part, other than one referred to in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, which shall determine that a portion of\nsuch allocation shall not be awarded to its students may notify the president, on or before the 15th day of September for the fall term of the academic year, or on or before the 15th day of January for the spring term of such year, the\namount of the unexpended portion of its allocation. Upon such notification, the\nallocation to the institution shall be deemed reduced by the amount set forth\nin such notice. The president may reallocate the amounts of the unexpended\nportion of allocations reported by such participating institution to other such\nparticipating institutions which have requested additional allocations. A\nrequest for an additional allocation shall be made by an institution on a form\nprescribed by the president. A request for the fall term of the academic year\nshall be submitted on or before the 15th day of September, and for the spring\nterm of such year on or before the 15th day of January. The request shall set\nforth the number of eligible students the institution estimates will receive\npart-time awards under its current allocation, and the amount of such awards, and the number of eligible students the institution estimates will not be able\nto receive awards under its current allocation and the amount of awards\nrequired therefor. The president may accept a notification of additional\navailable funds or a request for additional funds after the deadlines\nestablished herein, upon a demonstration of good cause for such late submission\nby the institution. (iii)\n\nAny\nreallocation received by a participating institution hereunder shall be subject\nto all the requirements of this Part as if the amount thereof had originally\nbeen included with the original allocation to the institution. (c) Prepayment of\nfunds. As soon after the beginning of the academic year as is practical, the\ncorporation shall make a payment to each participating institution in an amount\nwhich is 25 percent of that institution's annual allocation. In the event that\nan institution is determined to be eligible for an annual amount of funds less\nthan the amount of such prepayment, or is determined by the president to be\notherwise not entitled to such funds, then the institution shall be liable for\nan immediate refund of the amount of the excess prepayment, upon demand by the\ncorporation. (d) Reporting of award\nrecipients. (1)\n\nWithin 52 calendar days from\nthe date fixed by the institution for students to add or drop courses in a term\nfor which awards under this Part are to be made, as reported to the corporation\nby participating institutions, each institution shall submit to the corporation\na report containing the following information: (i) the name, social security number and date\nof birth of each award recipient for that term; (ii)\nthe amount of each individual award; and\n(iii)\nthe income of the\nrecipient and the recipient's family income, if used to determine the\naward. (2)\n(i) At such time as the report is submitted\npursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, institutions shall waive tuition\nfor the award recipients, in the amount of the award reported, for the term\nduring which the award is made. In the event a recipient has previously paid\nfull tuition, or a sufficient portion of that tuition such that a waiver of the\nfull amount of the award cannot be made, the institution shall refund to the\nrecipient an amount sufficient to effect such a waiver. Such a refund shall be\nmade within 45 calendar days of the submission of the report made pursuant to\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision or by the end of the term, whichever occurs\nfirst. (ii)\n\nThe institution shall\nnotify recipients of the amount of the award, of the waiver of tuition by the\ninstitution in that amount, and that the award is counted towards the maximum\nterm of eligibility under the tuition assistance program. In the event a\nrecipient is determined to be ineligible for an award after such notification\nis given, the institution shall advise the recipient in writing thereof, and\nthat its selection of such recipient and its waiver of tuition is a nullity. If\nthe determination of ineligibility is made prior to the date the institution\nsubmits its report of recipients to the corporation, a replacement recipient\nmay be selected, notified and reported. (3)\n\nUpon receipt of the report of award\nrecipients, the corporation shall review its records and determine whether any\nsuch recipients are ineligible for an award under this Part due to the\ndurational requirements found in section\n2207.1\n(h) of this\n\nPart. In the event that any reported recipients are so deemed ineligible by the\ncorporation, the corporation shall provide the names of such recipients to the\ninstitution. (4)\n\nPrior to the end\nof the refund period established at each institution for each term, the\ninstitution may determine whether a change in a recipient's enrollment status\nmakes that recipient ineligible for an award under this Part. In the event that\nthe corporation determines that any reported recipients at an institution are\nineligible pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subdivision, or the institution\ndetermines that a change in enrollment status has made a reported recipient\nineligible pursuant to this paragraph, the institution affected shall prepare a\nlist of alternate recipients and submit this list to the corporation, together\nwith all information required pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, within such time as prescribed by the president. This list shall contain only\nreplacements for original recipients, and in no event shall the submission of\nthis list increase the number of awards made by an institution for the term\ninvolved. Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, an institution may proceed to collect any tuition waived for recipients\ndetermined to be ineligible pursuant to this paragraph. Upon submission of the\nlist of alternate recipients, the institution shall waive tuition in the amount\nof the awards for such alternate recipients in the same manner as for original\nrecipients. In the event the corporation determines that any of the alternate\nrecipients submitted are ineligible due to the durational requirements found in\nsection\n2207.1\n(h) of this\n\nPart, the corporation shall report the names of such ineligible alternate\nrecipients to the institution. Notwithstanding the provisions of this\nparagraph, an institution may proceed to collect any tuition waived for\nalternate recipients so determined to be ineligible. No further recipients\nshall be selected to replace those alternate recipients found ineligible\npursuant to this paragraph. (5)\n\nWithin 45 days of the conclusion of each term for which the awards are made\npursuant to this section, each participating institution shall certify to the\ncorporation whether or not each student reported received a cumulative passing\naverage for the semester hours or equivalent undertaken pursuant to such award. Cumulative passing average, for purposes of this paragraph, shall be determined\nby the commissioner. The corporation shall reimburse the participating\ninstitution for each award made by such institution on behalf of an eligible\nstudent; provided, however, that if, during any term or semester, the value of\nthe awards conferred by the institution to students who fail to maintain a\ncumulative passing average exceeds 10 percent of the total value of all the\nawards conferred by the institution, the institution shall not be reimbursed\nfor the value of those awards made to students who fail to maintain a\ncumulative passing average which is in excess of 10 percent of the total value\nof all the awards conferred by the institution during that term or\nsemester.
