Tit. 10 § 456.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Cost finding is\nthe apportionment or allocation of the costs of the nonrevenue-producing\ncenters to each other and to the revenue-producing centers and final program\ncenters on the basis of statistical data reflective of the amount of service\nrendered by each center to the other centers. (b) In general, each nonrevenue, ancillary\nrevenue or program revenue center a total expense of operation which can be\ndescribed in an algebraic equation comprised of its own direct expense plus\nsome fraction of the total expense of the operation of each of the other\ncenters. (c) Also, each center has\na relationship to each of the other centers that can be described by a\nstatistical allocation basis which is reflective of the relative amount of\nservice rendered. (d) Cost finding\nis a mathematical process used to solve the problem of allocating expenses to\neach center and subtotal expense in each ancillary or program center after the\nallocation of nonrevenue centers has been accomplished. (e) While there are a number of methods that\ncan be and have been used (direct allocation, single step down, multiple step\ndown, matrix inversion, etc.), the matrix inversion process which solves\nequations simultaneously is the most accurate. This process recognizes all the\nservices provided by one reporting center to all other centers. The complete\nrecognition of services is not possible to the same degree in the other\ncost-finding processes. Although it is anticipated that the matrix inversion\nprocess will be used, the uniform system of statistical allocation is\napplicable to any process. (f) This\n\nPart discusses the segregation of costs, the source for the compilation of data\nand other information pertinent to the cost allocation process. (g) When the single step-down method of cost\nallocation is employed, the cost centers involved in the step down shall be\narrayed in the following sequence: Depreciation, Leases and Rentals\n\nDepreciation on Major Movable Equipment\n\nInterest on Capital Debt\n\nFiscal Services\n\nAdministrative Services\n\nPlant Operation and Maintenance\n\nGrounds\n\nSecurity\n\nLaundry and Linen\n\nHousekeeping\n\nPatient Food Service\n\nCafeteria\n\nNursing Administration\n\nActivities Program\n\nNon-Physician Education\n\nMedical Education\n\nMedical Director's Office\n\nMedical Records\n\nUtilization Review\n\nSocial Service\n\nTransportation\n\nLaboratory Service\n\nElectrocardiology\n\nElectroencephalogy\n\nRadiology\n\nInhalation Therapy\n\nPodiatry\n\nDental\n\nPsychiatric\n\nPhysical Therapy\n\nOccupational Therapy\n\nSpeech and Hearing Therapy\n\nPharmacy\n\nCentral Service Supply\n\nMedical Staff Service\n\nAncillary Other - A\nAncillary Other - B\nAncillary Other - C\nNotes\nN.Y.
