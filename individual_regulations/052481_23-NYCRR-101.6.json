Alternatively, if another entity or person is selected to perform\nan examination, investigation or review of an individual institution or\ninstitutions, the expenses associated with such examination, investigation and\nreview shall be the amount of the contract for such services and such portion\nof the Department's administrative expenses associated with such contract as\nthe Superintendent shall deem appropriate. The resulting amount shall be\nassessed separately to each such institution subject to such examination, investigation or investigation in such amounts as the Superintendent shall deem\nappropriate. Such special assessments shall be billed within one hundred\nand eighty days after the calendar quarter within which such expenses were\nincurred. Such amounts shall be paid within thirty days of the date of such\nbilling. In making a determination to make a special assessment and\nto allocate such assessment between one or more institutions, the\n\nSuperintendent shall include such factors as she or he shall deem appropriate, including, but not limited to: the significance of the examination to the\nconduct of business by a given Industry Group or institutions; the potential\nseriousness of any violations of law or regulation identified by, or under\nreview in, such examination or investigation; the likelihood that such\nviolations are common within an Industry Group; and the extent to which an\ninstitution attempted to cover up or failed to disclose the existence of such\nviolations. (b) The\n\nSuperintendent may exempt any not-for-profit entity licensed by the Department\nfrom any assessments otherwise applicable to such entity when the\n\nSuperintendent determines the public benefit warrants such exemption.
