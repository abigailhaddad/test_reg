  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-1.6 - Power of the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance to adjust the business apportionment factor\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A(11))\n(a) Generally, the BAF results in a fair\napportionment of the corporation's business capital and business income to New\n\nYork State. However, in certain instances, the BAF may not result in a proper\nreflection of the taxpayer's business income or business capital in New York\n\nState and the commissioner, as an exercise of discretion or at the request of\nthe taxpayer, is authorized to adjust the BAF in order to properly and fairly\nreflect the taxpayer's business income or business capital within New York. In\nthe case of a combined report, the term \"taxpayer\" in this section means the\ncombined group, and the request to adjust the BAF on the combined report must\nbe made by the designated agent. If the BAF is adjusted, it must be calculated\nto produce a fair and proper apportionment of the business income and business\ncapital of the taxpayer, or in the case of a combined report, the combined\ngroup, reasonably attributable to New York State. (b) When it appears that the BAF does not\nfairly and properly reflect the business income or business capital of the\ntaxpayer in New York State, the commissioner, as an exercise of discretion or\nat the request of the taxpayer, may adjust the BAF by: (1)\nexcluding one or more items of receipts, net income, net gain or other items included in the determination of the\nBAF; (2)\nincluding one or more\nother items in the determination of the BAF; or\n(3)\nany other similar or different method\ncalculated to effect a fair and proper apportionment of the taxpayer's business\nincome and business capital reasonably attributable to New York\n\nState. (c) (1)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in paragraph\n(4) of this subdivision, a request to vary the BAF must be submitted in writing\nand must be submitted separately from any report to which it relates and must\nset forth full information on which the request is based. (2)\nA taxpayer must compute its tax using the\nBAF determined pursuant to section 210-A and this Subchapter on its original\nreport for a taxable year unless the commissioner has approved a written\nrequest for an adjustment to the BAF prior to the filing of the original\nreport. (3)\nA taxpayer that\nreceives approval of its written request for an adjustment to the BAF after the\nfiling of its original report may file an amended report using the approved\nmethod to compute its tax due. (4)\nA taxpayer may file an amended report using its proposed BAF if the\ncommissioner did not respond to the taxpayer's written request for an\nadjustment to the BAF before the taxpayer filed its original report. Any such\namended report must be filed in accordance with procedures established by the\ncommissioner within the period of limitation for filing such a report and must\nbe accompanied by a full explanation and justification for the adjustments made\nto the BAF. The commissioner shall review the taxpayer's request, original\nreport, and amended report to determine whether or not the alternative BAF\nresults in a fair and proper reflection of the business income and business\ncapital of the taxpayer. (5)\n\nIf the\n\nAudit Division commences an audit of a report of a taxpayer, the taxpayer may, during the course of that audit, make a written request that the commissioner\nconsider, or reconsider, an alternative BAF, in which case the determination of\nwhether or not the BAF results in a fair and proper reflection of the business\nincome and business capital of the taxpayer will be made by the commissioner\nduring the course of that audit. (d) The party seeking to vary the BAF bears\nthe burden of proof to demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the\nBAF determined pursuant to section 210-A and the applicable regulations in this\n\nSubchapter does not result in a proper reflection of the taxpayer's business\nincome or business capital within New York State and that the proposed\nadjustment is appropriate. The party seeking to vary the BAF must demonstrate\nthat application of the statutory formula attributes income or capital to New\n\nYork State out of all proportion to the business transacted by the taxpayer in\n\nNew York State. (e) Examples. For purposes of these examples, it is assumed amounts\nrequested to be included in the BAF are properly included in business\nincome. Example 1: Corporation A's only office is located in New\n\nYork. Corporation A invests in stocks for its own account and also performs\nsome administrative and investment advisory services for customers located\nsolely in New York. 95%t of its income consists of dividends and net gains from\nits stock holdings. The remaining 5% of its income consists of the fees it\nreceives for the administrative and investment advisory services. The taxpayer\ndoes not make the fixed percentage election. As such, dividends and net gains\nfrom stock are not included in the numerator or denominator of the BAF unless\nthe commissioner determines that inclusion of such dividends and net gains is\nnecessary to properly reflect the taxpayer's business income or capital. In\nthis instance, under the statutory formula, the receipts generating 95% of the\ntaxpayer's income would not have any representation in the BAF. Accordingly, in\norder to properly reflect the taxpayer's business income, it is appropriate to\ninclude the dividends and net gains from the stock holdings in the BAF. The\ndividends from the stock of corporations domiciled in New York would be\nincluded in the numerator of the BAF. The net gains would be included in the\nnumerator of the BAF to the extent that the purchasers are located in New York, provided that if the purchaser is a registered securities broker or dealer or\nthe transaction is made through a licensed exchange, then 8% of the net gains\nwould be included in the numerator of the BAF. The total amount of dividends\nand net gains would be included in the denominator of the BAF. Example 2: Corporation B is a registered broker-dealer. The majority of its receipts are comprised of commissions derived from the\nexecution of securities and commodities purchase or sales orders. It has an\noffice in New York and an office in State X. These commissions are included in\nthe numerator of the BAF if the taxpayer's records indicate the mailing address\nof the customer who is responsible for paying such commissions is in New York\n\nState. However, in State X, these commissions are included in the numerator of\nthe BAF if the services are performed in State X. Corporation B is concerned\nthat the commissions for the purchase and sale orders executed by its office in\n\nState X for customers with New York mailing addresses will be sourced to State\nX for purposes of State X's tax and sourced to New York for New York purposes. Corporation B requests that New York allow a discretionary adjustment to\nexclude such receipts from the numerator of the BAF. This discretionary\nadjustment is not necessary. The fact that State X also would source\ncommissions from New York customers to State X does not mean that inclusion of\nthose commissions in the numerator of the New York BAF does not fairly and\nproperly reflect Corporation B's business income in New York State. Example 3: Corporation C is a corporate partner in\n\nPartnership X and for tax years 2015 through 2018 it computes its tax with\nrespect to its interest in such partnership under the aggregate method. In tax\nyear 2019, Corporation C's only activity for the year is the selling of its\nfinancial investments that results in $5,000,000 of business receipts. 75% of\nits business receipts, or $3,750,000, is the net gain from the sale of its\npartnership interest in Partnership X. Corporation C did not make the fixed\npercentage election. As such, net gains from the sale of a partnership interest\nare not included in the numerator or denominator of the BAF unless the\ncommissioner determines that inclusion of such net gains is necessary to\nproperly reflect the taxpayer's business income or capital. In this instance, under the statutory formula, the receipts generating 75% of the taxpayer's\nbusiness receipts would not have any representation in the BAF. Accordingly, in\norder to properly reflect the taxpayer's business income, it is appropriate to\ninclude the net gains from the sale of Partnership X in the BAF. Under the aggregate method, a corporate partner is\ntreated as participating in the partnership's transactions and activities and\nis viewed as having an undivided interest in the partnership's assets, liabilities and items of receipts, income, gain, loss and deduction. As such, the sale of Partnership X will be treated as the sale of the underlying assets\nowned by Partnership X. Corporation C must reasonably divide the net gain from\nthe sale of its interest among the types of underlying assets owned by\n\nPartnership X. The receipts or net gains from each type of asset must be\napportioned using the applicable rule in section 210-A and this Subchapter for\neach type of asset. Partnership X's assets consist of tangible personal\nproperty, real property, and goodwill. The portion of the gain attributable to\nthe sale of tangible personal property is included in New York receipts if the\ntangible personal property is in New York State pursuant to section\n4-2.1\nof this Part. The portion\nattributable to the sale of real property is included in New York receipts if\nthe real property is located in New York State pursuant to section\n4-2.2\nof this Part. The portion\nattributable to goodwill is included in New York receipts if the value is\naccumulated in New York State, based on the partnership's average business\nallocation percentage (BAP) from the previous three years, pursuant to section\n4-4.3\n(e) of this\n\nPart. The net gain from the sale of the interest in Partnership X is included\nin everywhere receipts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
