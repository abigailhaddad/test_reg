  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 81.4 - Notice of rights\n\nState Regulations\n\nEvery pet dealer who sells a dog or a cat to a consumer\nshall provide the consumer at the time of sale with the following written\nnotice, printed or typed, setting forth the rights provided under article 35-B\nof the General Business Law. If such notice is contained in a written contract, it shall be in 10-point boldface type. NOTICE\nArticle 35-B of the General Business Law, hereinafter\nreferred to as \"the law,\" sets forth certain rights which arise when a consumer\npurchases a dog or a cat from a pet dealer. Pursuant to the law, the\n\nCommissioner of Agriculture and Markets has promulgated regulations which\nrequire a pet dealer to provide certain information to a consumer in writing\nupon the sale of an animal. Such information shall include a description, including the breed of the animal, the date of purchase, the name, address and\ntelephone number of the consumer and the pet dealer and the amount of the\npurchase. The pet dealer shall certify such information by signing and dating\nthe document in which it is contained. The law further provides that if, within 14 days following\nthe sale of a dog or a cat, a veterinarian of the consumer's choosing, licensed\nby a state certifies such animal to be unfit for purchase due to illness, a\ncongenital malformation which adversely affects the health of the animal, or\nthe presence of symptoms of a contagious or infectious disease, the pet dealer\nshall afford the consumer the right to choose one of the following\noptions: (a) the right to return the\nanimal and receive a refund of the purchase price, including sales tax and\nreasonable veterinary costs directly related to the veterinarian's\ncertification that the animal is unfit for purchase; (b) the right to return the animal and to\nreceive an exchange animal of the consumer's choice of equivalent value and\nreasonable veterinary costs directly related to the veterinarian's\ncertification that the animal is unfit for purchase; or\n(c) the right to retain the animal and to\nreceive reimbursement from a pet dealer for veterinary services from a licensed\nveterinarian of the consumer's choosing, for the purpose of curing or\nattempting to cure the animal. The reasonable value of reimbursable services\nrendered to cure or attempting to cure the animal shall not exceed the purchase\nprice of the animal. The value of such services is reasonable if comparable to\nthe value of similar services rendered by other licensed veterinarians in\nproximity to treating veterinarians. Such reimbursement shall not include the\ncosts of initial veterinary examination, fees and diagnostic fees not directly\nrelated to the veterinarian's certification that the animal is unfit for\npurchase. The law requires that any refund and/or reimbursement\nrequired shall be made by a pet dealer not later than 10 business days\nfollowing receipt of a signed veterinary certificate as herein required. Such\ncertification shall be presented to the pet dealer not later than three\nbusiness days following receipt thereof by the consumer. The Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets has prescribed\na form for the certification that an animal is unfit for purchase which shall\nbe provided to a consumer by an examining veterinarian upon the examination of\na dog or cat subject to the law. That form includes information which\nidentifies the type of animal, the owner, the date and diagnosis of the animal, the treatment recommended, if any, and an estimate of the actual cost of such\ntreatment. Such form also includes this notice. The law provides that a veterinary finding of intestinal\nparasites shall not be grounds for declaring the dog or cat unfit for sale\nunless the animal is clinically ill due to such condition. An animal may not be\nfound unfit for sale on account of an injury sustained or illness contracted\nsubsequent to the consumer taking possession thereof. The law provides that if a pet dealer wishes to contest a\ndemand for a refund, exchange or reimbursement made by a consumer such dealer\nshall have the right to require the consumer to produce the animal for\nexamination by a licensed veterinarian designated by such dealer. Upon\nexamination if the consumer and the dealer are unable to reach an agreement\nwhich constitutes one of the options set forth in the law within 10 business\ndays following receipt of the animal for such examination, the consumer may\ninitiate an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover or obtain\nsuch refund, exchange and/or reimbursement. Nothing in section\n742\nof the\n\nGeneral Business Law, however, in any way limits the rights or remedies which\nare otherwise available to consumers under any other law. For the purposes of the law, consumer\nmeans an individual purchasing a dog or a cat from a pet dealer. A pet dealer\nshall not be considered a consumer. Pet dealer\nmeans any\nperson, firm, partnership, corporation or other association which in the\nordinary course of business engages in the sale of more than one litter of dogs\nor cats per year for profit to the public. Such definition includes breeders of\nanimals who sell animals directly to a consumer but does not include duly\nincorporated humane societies dedicated to the care of unwanted animals which\nmake such animals available for adoption whether or not a fee for such adoption\nis charged.
